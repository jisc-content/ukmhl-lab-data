56 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 3.52. United Fracture at the Junction of the Upper and Middle Thirds of the Femur. Eversion of Limb. Hunterian. Left femur macerated and dried, showing the above. This contrasts with the last in the upper fragment being to the inside and in front of the lower, which is distinctly everted. The femur is bent inwards at the seat of fracture. 3.53. United Fracture of the Femur at the Middle. Riding of the Fragments. Hunterian. Right femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The fracture is very strongly united, but the upper fragment is tilted forwards, and the lower lies behind, external to, and overlapping it. There must have been considerable shortening, and the inner con- dyle is higher than the outer, but there is neither eversion nor inversion of the lower fragm.ent. 3.54. United Fracture of the Femur about the Middle. Vascularity of Callus. Hunterian. LL. 6. Section of a left femur injected red, decalcified, dried, and mounted in turpentine, illustrating the above. The upper fragment has been riding over the front of the lower to the extent of fully 4 cm., and union has been effected by a large mass of callus. This is of irregularly rounded shape and fairly smooth on the outside, showing that the fracture was already of considerable age. On the cut surface there appears a marrow cavity of triangular shape in the callus between the ends. The lower fragment is cut obliquely. The upper has its marrow cavity closed by a thin shell of bone. The whole is very vascular. 3.55. Vascularity of Callus. Hunterian. LL. 10. Upper portion of the other section of the preceding, the uniting mass of callus cut through. In turpentine. 3.56. Section of a United Fracture of the Shaft of the Femur. Hunterian. LL. 7. Injected red and mounted in turpentine. The fracture has been very similar to the last, but union has been very much further advanced. The section passes longitudinally through the upper

45 INJURIES OF BONE. ind of the outer fragment, and overlapping of the two ends. Union las taken place with formation of a large amount of new bone. The nner fragment has also tilted up considerably. 3.17. United Fracture of the Clavicle about the Middle. Huntcrian. A smallish right clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the ibove. The fracture has united with the characteristic elevation of ;he outer end of the inner fragment and increase of the natural ;urve. The bone is quite smooth and very little thickened at the seat of fracture. 3.18. United Fracture of the Clavicle about the Middle. Hmiterian. Right clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has united with little thickening, but the inner fragment bas been tilted up, the ends have overlapped, and there was probably 1 good deal of shortening. 3.19. United Fracture of the Clavicle at Junction of Inner and Middle Thirds. Hunterian. Left clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has united with considerable deformity, the inner fragment being tilted up and projecting markedly above the outer. 3.20. United Fracture of the Clavicle at the Middle* Hunterian. Right clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has united with the characteristic projection upwards of the inner fragment, and increase of the natural curvature forwards. Probably not much shortening. 3.21. United Fracture of the Clavicle near the Acromial End. Hunterian. Left clavicle macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The fracture has been about 3 to 4 cm. from the acromion, just about the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. There is almost no thickening of the bone, and the deformit} amounts only to a slight increase of the curvature backwards, and slight depression of the outer fragment.

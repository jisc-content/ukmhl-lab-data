COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY OF OSTEOMA. ]3l marble, growing from the side of the body of one of the verte- brae. 5.172b. Hyperostosis of Vertebrae in Haddock. Presented hij Ilohert Mason, Esq., 1889. Vertebral column of a haddock cleaned and dried. The bodies of fifteen of the vertebrae of the tail portion are expanded to three or four times their normal size. The expansion is quite regular, and apparently osseous. There is no interference with the canal of either dorsal or ventral arches. (h) Sarcomata of Bone. (a) central. 5.173. Large Central Sarcoma of the Humerus. Jeffray Collection. A large tumour, involving about the upper two-thirds of the shaft and head of the humerus, overlying soft parts removed, ex- cept a few muscles which are stretched and spread out upon it. The large arteries have been injected red and dissected; the cir- cumflex is much elongated. The tumour forms a large carrot-shaped mass, about 10 cm. in diameter near the top, and tapering down- wards to the unaffected portion of the shaft. The articular surface of the head projects from one side on a level with the top. Its cartilage is intact, but it is hollowed out to a mere shell. There are several large holes in the tumour, through which the contents, which have evidently been very soft, have escaped, leaving the outer shell, which is clearly the expanded shaft of the bone. Its walls are 1 to 2 cm. thick, and composed of soft tumour tissue, mixed with a good deal of bone in irregular spicules and plates. It had been stuff'ed to preserve its shape while hardening. There is no history. Microscopically, it is clearly a sarcoma; although the tissue is extremely degenerated. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 9.) 5.174. Central Sarcoma of Radius. Jeffray Collection. Portions of the humerus, radius and ulna, and soft parts dissected to show an oval tumour which has expanded the upper third of the

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 272 14.8. Excretory Ducts. Vaginal Glands. Ass. Hunterian. G. 21, Two " Lacunae" from the vagina of an ass; the duct is large enough to admit a fine probe, and rises by a number of fine branches from the different lobules of the gland. In turpentine. 14.9. The Mucous Glands of the Tongue. Hunterian. G. l\. The base of the tongue, showing a number of round elevated bodies, with a round orifice on the top, which are mucous glands. The secretion is poured into the cup-like follicle by numbers of minute ducts. (c) Intestinal Glands. 14.10. Intestinal Glands and Lymph Follicles. Hunterian. G. 12. The caput caecum, part of colon, and termination of the ileum of a foetus injected red, laid open, showing the highly vascular glandular mucous membrane of the intestines, and also the lymph follicles formerly called "solitary glands." These are not glandular, but masses of adenoid tissue like the cell-masses of lymphatic glands, tonsil, root of tongue, and the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, for which see Series 31 and 35. (d) The Different Forms of Glands, 14.11. " Globulated Glands." Kidney of Oat. Hunterian. G. 23. A section of a kidney of a cat, injected red, as an example of a gland which shows no trace of lobulation. William Hunter regarded the external form as not at all an essential character of secreting organs, and illustrated this by showing the different forms assumed by the kidneys in different animals.

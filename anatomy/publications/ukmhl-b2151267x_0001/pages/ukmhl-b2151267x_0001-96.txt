The whole bone appears very vascular, but especially the upper end where the epiphysis has been pulled off. 1.50. Blood-vessels entering Cartilaginous Epiphysis. Hunterian. N. 107&. The lower end of the same bone as the preceding with the epiphysis pulled off and sliced transversely, showing a large centre of ossification. " In the cut-off extremity of the lower end the vessels which were passing from the bone into the cartilaginous epiphysis are seen large or floating, as cut off or torn through in separating the epiphysis." A considerable number of vessels remain in the corre- sponding surface of the epiphysis. 1.51. Ossification in Cartilage. Hunterian. N. 107c. Foot of a slink calf injected red, and a slice cut off one side, showing " the ossifications injected in the centre of cartilages of the metatarsal bone," and phalanges. 1.52.

Similar to the i^receding. 1.54. Ossification in Cartilage. Hunterian. N. I07h. Similar to the preceding. 1.55. Ossification in Membrane. Hunterian. N. 121.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 72 outgrowth of bone from both fragments, the rough surfaces of which interlocked, and had doubtless produced a certain degree of union, which time would have consolidated. 3.108. United Fracture of the Tibia of an Antelope. Huntericm. Kight tibia with the lower bones and hoof, macerated and dried, showing the above. That this is a fairly recent fracture is evident from the porosity and irregularity of the new bone. There is very marked riding of the ends, which are embedded in and firmly united by a mass of new-formed bone of a diameter fully three times that of the normal shaftâ€”an extensive osseous new forma- tion characteristic of healing fractures not kept at rest and in good position. 3.109. Old United Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula, " from a Sow." Hxmterian. Left tibia and fibula macerated and dried, showing the above. In this fracture also there has been considerable riding and doubt- less movement, too, so the point of union is much thicker than the rest of the bone. The mass of callus has, however, in the course of time, become dense and smooth and much reduced in size. The fibula is incorporated with the tibia at the seat of fracture.

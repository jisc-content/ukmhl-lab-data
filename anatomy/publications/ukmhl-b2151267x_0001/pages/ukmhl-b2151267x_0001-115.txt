" The inner surface of the patella; its cartilaginous covering, by long maceration in water, has its fibres unravelled; some of these are dug out to show that the fibres of cartilage are perpendicular to the end of the bone they cover." An engraving of this specimen is used to illustrate the paper in Philosophical Transactions far 1742-43, Vol. XLIL, p. 514, "Of the Structure and Diseases of Articulating Cartilages, by William Hunter, Surgeon," from which the following is a quotation : "An articulating cartilage is an elastic substance uniformly com- pact, of a white colour and somewhat diaphanous, having a smooth polished surface covered with a membrane; harder and more brittle than a ligament, softer and more pliable than a bone."

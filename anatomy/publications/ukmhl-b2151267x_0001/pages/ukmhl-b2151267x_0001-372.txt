HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 288 17.40. The Lungs of a Foetus. Hunterian. T. 6. The trachea and kings of a foetus, injected red, showing the division into lobes; the right into three—upper, middle, and lower ; the left into two—upper and lower. They are convex on the back and outside, adapted to the hollows by the sides of the spine and the ribs, and terminate in front in sharp edges which overlap the heart. The left shows a bay in its anterior edge where the heart is left uncovered. They are highly vascular and lobulated, the lobules being kept together by the interlobular conective tissue and the pleura. They are much solider, and the edges much sharper than after respiration has taken place. The relations of the lungs to the other thoracic viscera is much better seen in the dissections of the foetus, Nos. 10.8-10.14. 17.41. The Lungs of a "Foetus." Hunterian. T. 7.

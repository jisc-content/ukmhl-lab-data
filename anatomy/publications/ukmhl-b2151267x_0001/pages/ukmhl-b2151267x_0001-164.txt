HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 80 especially about the junction of the lower and middle thirds. The bone is fairly heavy, being abnormally thick for its length, very porous on its surface, and rather swollen at the ends. 5.20. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Right tibia, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. It is very markedly bent forwards. On the outer side is a rough raised facet-like mark, as if the fibula had pressed on it, giving rise to some inflammation and formation of new bone. This bone is figured in Cheselden's Osteographia, Plate LIL, fig. 3, as "The Tibia of a man who had had the Rickets." 5.21. Distortion of the Tibia and Fibula due to Rickets, Hunterian. Right tibia and fibula, probably from a grave, showing the above. There has been complete osseous ankylosis of the upper tibio-fibular articulation, cause unknown; the fibula has subsequently been broken off at the neck. The tibia is bent forwards and inwards and the fibula has followed it, and has also flattened out into a sort of boomerang shape, which is very striking. Compare No. 5. 30. 5.22. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left tibia, macerated and dried, showing a slight curvature for- wards. A very thick heavy bone, showing on its surface traces of chronic inflammation. 5.23. Distortion of the Tibia and Fibula due to Rickets. Hunterian. Right tibia and fibula macerated and dried, showing the above. The degree of deformity is slight. The tibia is bent inwards and forwards chiefly about the middle and upper thirds; the fibula rather lower down. The latter is also flattened in a manner resembling Nos. 5. 20 and 5. 30, but to a much less degree. 5.24. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Left tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. The bone is very thick and heavy, and bent forwards and outwards and markedly flattened laterally.

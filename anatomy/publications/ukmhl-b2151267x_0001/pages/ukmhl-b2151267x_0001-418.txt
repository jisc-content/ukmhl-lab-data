On microscopic examination it is found to consist of round masses, apparently of cellular tissue more or less necrosed, separated by strands of fibrous tissue traversed by a few large blood-vesselsâ€” a gumma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 46.) V. Tumours of the Brain and Meninges. 22.10. Fibroma of the Dura Mater. Eunterian. Not described. The dura mater of the vault of the cranium and the falx cerebri. Close to the falx a round tumour between 2 and 3 cm. in diameter, attached to the dura mater by a narrow base, projects inwards upon the brain. It is hard, and on micro- scopic examination is found to be a fibroma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 54.) 22.11. Psammoma of the Choroid Plexuses. Eunterian. EE. 31. " Plexus choroides of either side, with some hard nodules in them. (Case unknown.) " They are composed of fibrous tissue, with round grains of sand, like miniature calculi, embedded in it, and numerous lood-vessels. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 51.) 22.12. Psammoma of the Choroid Plexuses. Eunterian. EE. 32. The choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, showing a pair of round nodules similar to the last, but larger. " From a woman who died mad." (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 52.) 22.13. Tumour of the Brain, involving- the Lateral Sinus. Eunterian. EE. 28. " Inflammation and suppuration with ulcer in the posterior part of the posterior (occipital) lobus cerebri; the dura mater near the lateral sinus was corroded, and the sinus nearly dissected round." The sinus is opened ; it is occupied by a blood-clot. The bulk of the tumour is inside the dura mater, but has infiltrated it, and appears on the outside also. On microscopic examination the

SEKIES 7. STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS, SYNOVIAL SHEATHS, BURSAE, FASCIAE, AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE. (a) Muscle and Tendon. 7.1. Relations of the Muscles and other Structures in a Limb. Hunterian. H. 1. " A transverse section of the arm of a child across the belly of the flexor biceps cubiti. The blood was washed out of the muscles by repeated injections of water from the artery, which, returning by the veins, entirely emptied the vessels of their natural fluids. The muscles now appear equally white with the bone or skin." A bristle marks the brachial artery with the median nerve beside it. 7.2. Muscular Fibres. Hunterian. H. 2. " A piece of boiled beef macerated in water, principally at one end. It shows that a muscle is composed of larger packets of fibres, these again of smaller, and these last of barely visible fibres." 7.3. Muscular Fibres. Hunterian. H. 3. " A piece of boiled ham treated in the same way. Many of the fibres are as fine as the threads of a spider's web, and probably are the constituent or smallest muscular fibres." 7.4. The Blood-vessels and the Relations of Muscle and Tendon. Hunterian. H. 4. Diaphragm of a child, injected red, dried, and mounted in tur- pentine, illustrating the above. The muscle is so finely injected as to seem "composed entirely of vessels."

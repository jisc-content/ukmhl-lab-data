THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 287 17.33. The Larynx of the Turtle. Hunierian. T. 2L 17.34. Part of the Trachea. Horse. Hunierian. T. 26. The cartilaginous rings go right round, and even overlap, but are connected behind only by soft parts, mostly loose fibrous tissue. Probably the overlapping is due to shrinking in the spirit. Compare the succeeding. 17.35. Tracheal Rings. Ass. Hunterian. T. 27. The cartilages, as in the preceding, pass right round, the ends almost overlapping. 17.36. The Structure of the Trachea. Horse. Hunterian. T. 28. "A portion of the trachea as it gets more into the lung. The cartilages are replaced by membranous or ligamentous substance; the muscular fibres inside also appear longitudinal." Injected red and in turpentine. 17.37. The Structure of the Trachea. Turtle. Hunterian. T. 29.. The cartilages form complete rings of oval shape. 17.38. Arteries of the Trachea. Calf. Hunterian. T. 34e. A portion of the trachea of a foetal calf, injected red, laid flat, dried and mounted in turpentine. A small artery runs along both edges of each cartilaginous ring, with another between on, the membrane, and an abundance of minute cross branches. (c) The Lungs. 17. 39. The Pleura. Hunterian. T. l\. A portion of the investing serous sac of the lungs—parietal layer of the pleura—stripped from the chest wall. Injected red, driedj varnished, and mounted on blue paper. It appears highly vascular from the number of vessels running in its deeper layers.

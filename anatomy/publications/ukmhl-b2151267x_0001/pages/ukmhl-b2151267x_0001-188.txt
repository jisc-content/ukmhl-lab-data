104 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. epiphysial abscess is unknown. The leg was probably amputated below the knee on account of the acute disease, which, from the shape and appearance of the bone, had supervened on an old standing osteosclerosis. (C) DISEASES OF BONE IN CONNECTION WITH WOUNDS WHICH HAVE BECOME SEPTIC: SEPTIC OR INFECTIVE OSTEOMYELITIS. (a) The disease advancing. 5.86. Septic Osteomyelitis after Compound Fracture. Rare- fying' Osteitis. Hunterian. LL. 42. Longitudinal section of part of a bone, probably the femur, coarsely injected red. The lower end of the specimen presents the appearance of a fracture. Small portions of the point seem to be necrosed and undergoing separation. For a considerable way up, the dense bone of the shaft is irregularly rarefied. 5.87. Septic Periostitis and Osteomyelitis of Scapula. Hunterian. A whole right scapula macerated and dried, illustrating the above. It is encased in an irregular shell of porous new-formed bone, broken here and there, allowing the old bone to be seen. It is not necrosed, but has been in a condition of rarefying osteomyelitis. The glenoid facet is destroyed, and at one side of it there is a small hollow like an abscess cavity. The new-formation is greatest around the neck, probably the sequel of amputation or disease of the shoulder-joint gone septic. 5.88. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Hunterian. Portion of a femur macerated and dried, showing the above. The end of the stump is enlarged slightly by periosteal new-formation; but the chief change is in the shape of rarefaction of the old dense wall of the bone ; this extends a considerable way up the shaft. 5. 89. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Rarefaction. Necrosis. Hunterian. Portion of a tibia, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. Like the preceding, it shows some thickening of the end by periosteal

Conger Eel. Hunterian. QQ. 57. The stomach of the conger eel, with part of one side cut out, injected, the arteries red, the lymphatics with mercury. The lymphatics are very numerous and regularly arranged, the larger trunks running round the organ along with the arteries and disappearing in the loose omental tissue at the curvatures, where, in mammals, there would be lymphatic glands, which, however, do not exist in fish. 12.65. The Lymphatics of the Stomach. Conger Eel. Hwnterian. QQ. 58. A small piece, similar to the preceding. (i) The Lymphatics of the Intestines: Lacteals and Mesenteric Glands. 12.66. "The whole Mesentery from an Adult Human Subject," showing the Lymphatic Glands. Hunterian. D. 48. " The peritoneum of one side is removed to show the glands of the absorbents." The mesenteric artery is seen branching soon after it enters the mesentery. About these first branchings lies an inner circle of glands, and nearer the intestinal border lie more glands, mostly of smaller size. The distal edge of the mesentery is very much corrugated to give space for the attach- ment of the intestines. 12.67. "The whole Mesentery of a Child at Birth." Hunterian. D. 48a. The arteries injected red, the veins black, and the specimen mounted on mica. It forms almost a complete circle;'the sector which is occupied only by a thin sheet of tissue is its base, where it is attached over the spine and receives the mesenteric

THE BRAIN. red. It forms fringes projecting into the sulci, and is highly vascular. The arachnoid is seen floating loosely over the pia mater about the medulla oblongata, the subarachnoid space being of considerable extent in that region. Compare No. 21.28. 21.27. The Blood-vessels of the Cerebellum. Hunterian. EE. 17. The cerebellum of a child injected red, showing the above; " half dried and put afterwards into spirits." " It gives a fine idea of the great vascularity of cerebellum." 21.28. The Arachnoid Membrane. Hunterian. EE. 9^. The medulla oblongata of an adult turned upside down to- show the "loose floating" arachnoid membrane. It is suspended by the vertebral arteries, which were divided close inside the dura mater. The arachnoid is not so distinct elsewhere as here ; over the cerebral hemispheres it is hardly distinguishable. (b) the brain. 21.29. The Medulla Oblongata, Pons Varolii, and Fourth Ventricle. Hunterian. EE. 21. A portion of the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, all the membranes and origins of the nerves and the roof of the fourth ventricle removed. In front are seen the anterior median fissure with the anterior pyramids and olivary bodies. The decussating fibres of the anterior pyramids lie too deep in the fissure to be seen without separating its borders. At the sides of the pons are- seen the peduncles of the cerebellum cut short; and behind, the lozenge-shaped fourth ventricle is laid open, showing the posterior median fissure and the fasciculi teretes forming its floor; it is bounded at its upper end by the cut edge of the valve of Vieussens, which formed its roof, and the superior peduncles of' the cerebellum ending in the corpora quadrigemina; below, by the posterior pyramids, in the angle between which is the portion^ of the floor of the ventricle called the calamus scriptorius, with, the central canal of the spinal cord opening at its point.

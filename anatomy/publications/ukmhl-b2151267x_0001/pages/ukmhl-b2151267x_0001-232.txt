148 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. the head of the bone seven rounded cavities, which, during life, were doubtless tubercular foci. Probably the disease, in this case, was primarily in the bone. The cavities appear not to extend deeper than the epiphysis. From an adult. 6.11a. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Changes in the Bones. Hunterian. Head of left tibia macerated and dried, showing the above. The articular surfaces are worn, irregular, and rarefied—a condition of caries. In the internal condyle there is also a sequestrum with the groove of separation nearly complete all round. Its surface is eburnated. Compare No. 6.13. Around the articular head and down the shaft there has been some periosteal new-formation of bone, probably due to the joint having become infected by pyogenic organisms through sinuses left by the opening of the tubercular abscesses. 6.12. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Changes in the Bones. Hunterian. Lower end of femur macerated and dried, showing changes similar to those in the preceding—partly tubercular, partly septic. 6.13. Tubercular Arthritis. Knee-joint. Changes in the Bones. Eburnated Sequestra. Hunterian. Lower end of right femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The specimen shows erosion and a number of small rounded cavities, probably tubercular foci, in the osseous articular surface. There are also several sequestra, one measuring fully 3 cm. by 2 cm., situated in the midst of the cancellous bone of the condyles and nearly separated by absorption of the layers of bone around them. The surfaces turned towards the joint are extremely dense and polished, in parts almost like porcelain—eburnated. They extend some little way into the condyle, and their deeper portions seem also somewhat condensed. They are supposed to be produced by a necrosis following on cutting-off of the blood supply by a gradually advancing osteosclerosis. Compare under Arthritis De- formans, Nos. 6.52, et seq.

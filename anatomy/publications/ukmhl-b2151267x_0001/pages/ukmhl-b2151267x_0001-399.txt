THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 815 filled with red wax. The veins appear to enter the sinus obliquely and in a direction contrary to that of the flow of blood in it. 21.15. The Dura Mater in situ. The Falx Cerebri and Longitudinal Sinus. Htmterian. E. 6. The vault of the cranium " of a child," with the dura mater still adhering, showing the falx cerebri and the superior longitudinal sinus and some of the veins entering it injected red. The inferior longitudinal sinus runs in the lower edge of the falx, but is not injected. 21.16. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus. Hunterian. EE. 12. The sinus is laid open from above, " to show the bridles or frena, which pass from side to side to prevent overdistension." 21.17. The Dura Mater. Pacchionian Bodies. Hunterian. EE. 126. " A portion of the dura mater, the longitudinal sinus laid open, and two bristles in veins, showing that these veins open into the sinus against the current of the blood; also round bodies in clusters, the supposed glands of Pacchionus." These are not glands, but hypertrophied villi of the arachnoid, which have grown through the dura mater and lie in little depressions of the bone, especially along the edges of the lateral sinus. 21.18. The Dura Mater. Hunterian. EE. 12a. The arteries are injected red to considerable minuteness. Numerous branches to the bones project on the outer surface; the inner surface is smooth, glistening, and avascular like tendon. 21.19. The Dura Mater. Hunterian. EE. 12c. A similar portion, " the arteries and veins full of their own blood. Coagulated by vinegar." Completely decolourized by spirit. 21.20. The Pia Mater. Hunterian. E. 7. A portion of the pia mater from the upper surface of the cerebrum, uninjected, showing the outer surface smooth and

TUBERCULAR A RTHRITIS. 155 active in the centre of the facet, where the bone is eroded and rarefied. Probably old tubercular disease. ELBOW-JOINT—(a) WHERE THE DISEASE HAS BEEN ADVANCING. 6.32. Tubercular Arthritis. Elbow-joint. Advanced Stage of Destruction. Hunterian. LL. 51. Ends of humerus, radius, and ulna dissected, in spirit, illustrating the above. Formerly described as follows: " The Elbow Joint, where the cartilage has been removed from the os brachii and from the head of the radius, and where the cartilage has not only been removed from the sigmoid cavities of ulna, but the shape considerably altered by long-continued ulceration." The case has probably been an ordinary tubercular elbow, with abscesses and septic infection. The joint is disorganized, the cartilages have sloughed, and the bones are carious. In the radial head of the humerus is an ebur- nated sequestrum. 6.33. Tubercular Arthritis. Advanced. Elbow-joint. Hunterian. Right ulna macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The greater sigmoid cavity is deepened and widened by irregular ulcera- tion of the bone after the cartilages had been destroyed. The lesser sigmoid cavity has also been involved. Probably tubercular. There has been some new-formation of bone and condensation round about the edges—probably the result of a secondary septic infection. 6.34. Tubercular (?) Arthritis. Elbow-Joint. Changes in the Bones. Hunterian. Part of left ulna macerated and dried, illustrating the above. Both sigmoid cavities have been denuded of cartilage, and the bone considerably eroded. The osseous remains of the articular surfaces and the head of the bone around the joint have afterwards been the subject of condensing osteitis and periosteal new-forma- tion. Probably tubercular disease of old standing, and complicated by septic infection.

305 TUMOURS OF TEE LUNQS. 18.40. Carcinoma in the Thorax. Hunterian. T. 85. A mass about the size of an orange, formerly described as " portions of the left lobe of the lung, with a scrophulous tumour as big as a child's head at birth, which compressed them so that no air passed into them; the tumour was painful, and killed the patient (Dr. J. Jebbs, Westminster)." Microscopic examination shows it to be a carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 3.) U

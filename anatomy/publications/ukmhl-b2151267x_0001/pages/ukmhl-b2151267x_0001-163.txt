RICKETS. 79 5.14. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Huntericm. Left femur of an adult macerated and dried, showing the above. Similar to the foregoing. 5.15. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Huntericm. Left femur of an adult macerated and dried, showing the above. The distortion in this specimen is inwards and very slightly for- wards, with slight flattening at right angles to the plane of the curve. This specimen is thinner than most rickety femora. 5.16. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Hunterian. Right femur of an adult macerated and dried, showing the above. The curvature is in the lower half of the bone, inwards and for- wards. The inner condyle is not elongated, but there was probably slight genu valgum from the curvature of the shaft. There is slight enlargement at the epiphysial line. 5.17. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Huntericm. Left femur of an adult macerated and dried, showing the above. There is marked convexity forwards, especially in the lower third, causing a degree of deformity which must have been inconvenient. The articular surface of the condyles is turned considerably back- wards. 5.18. Distortion of the Femur due to Rickets. Inward Curve of Shaft and Elongation of Internal Con- dyle. Hunterian. Left femur of an adult macerated and dried, showing the con- dition which especially gives rise to genu valgum. The shaft as a whole is curved forwards and inwards. Towards its lower end especially it is flattened in an obliquely antero-posterior direction. The elongation of the internal condyle is very striking, and along with the curvature must have produced very decided genu valgum. 5.19. Distortion of the Tibia due to Rickets. Hunterian. Tibia of a young subject, epiphyses wanting, macerated and dried, showing the above. The specimen shows marked bending forwards,

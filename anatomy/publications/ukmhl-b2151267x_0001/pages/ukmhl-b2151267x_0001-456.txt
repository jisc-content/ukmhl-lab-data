372 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. antrum and antro-tympanic passage (opened from the outside) above and behind the tympanum. IV. Comparative Anatomy of the Ear. (a) mammals. 25.31. Ear of Guinea-Pig. Hunterian. HH. 25. " Membrana tympani, with malleus, vestibulum, and cochlea, from the guinea pig. The cochlea is transparent, and the gyrations may be distinctly seen through its parietes ; it resembles a species of small Oriental pyramidal shell." Best seen when held up against the light. 25.32. Auditory Ossicles of Dog, Sheep, Monkey, and Calf. Hunterian. HH. 31. "They are three in number as in men. The malleus is a little different in its shape; the others come very near the human. Those of the monkey most like the human." (b) birds. 25.33. The Head of a Pheasant, showing the Ears Dis- sected. Hunterian. HH. 23. "The head of a pheasant, the organ of hearing exposed on both sides ; the meatus externus is about half an inch in length, and runs obliquely backwards and inwards. At the bottom of this passage in all birds are two rows of glands resembling the human sublingual glands, with a number of orifices; these are certainly the glandulae ceruminosae. The membrana tympani is convex externally, and turned obliquely backwards and outwards ; its under edge is more inwards, and its upper edge of course more outwards; there is but one ossiculum, which is rather a kind of stapes; by one end it shuts up the fenestra ovalis, and at the other it joins a cartilage in the same line with itself, but which at the membrana tympani is bent nearly at right angles to the stapes, and attached to the posterior side of the circle or ellipse in which the membrana tympani is fixed. There are three canals

SERIES 26. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE EAR. 26.1. Perforation of the Membrana Tympani. Hunterian. HH. 16a. " Perforated Naturally," is stated in the old catalogue, but it is much more probable that it is a case of perforation due to catarrh of the middle ear. It is situated just in front of the lower end of the manubrium; the membrane does not appear to be thickened. A piece of blue paper is placed on the tympanic cavity, and a bristle in the perforation. 26.2. Carcinoma of the Middle Ear. Je^ffray Collection. The left temporal bone and external ear divided by vertical transverse section through the external auditory meatus, showing a tumour iilling up the tympanic cavity, destroying the tegmen tympani, involving the dura mater over it and projecting into the middle fossa of the skull; also appearing in the external auditory meatus and behind the ear (the pinna being decidedly pushed out from the side of the head), and in the carotid canal. The sides of the inner half of the meatus externus are infiltrated by tumour, and rough, presenting the appearance of a malignant ulcer. No trace of the membrana tympani remains. The bony walls of the tympanic cavity have been destroyed more or less on all sides, but the precise extent to which the inner wall and iiiternal ear is involved does not appear. The growth has no distinct boundary. It is a rounded irregular mass, measuring about 5 cm. in its vertical and transverse diameters, and about 3 cm. from back to front. Below, it is continuous with the parotid gland, and appears to be infiltrating it. A bristle is passed through the

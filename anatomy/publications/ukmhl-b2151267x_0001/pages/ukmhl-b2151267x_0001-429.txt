THE EYELIDS AND LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. 345 23.3. The Eyelids. Hunterian. FF. 4. Similar to No. 23.1, mounted in turpentine. 23.4. The Eyelids. The Conjunctiva, Hunterian. FF. 5. The left eyeball and eyelids of a child, injected red. The lids are everted, and turned back over the eyeball to show the cavity of the conjunctiva, which forms a continuous membrane over the inside of the eyelids and front of the eyeball, and passes into the orifices of the ducts of the lachrymal gland and puncta lachrymalia. The part lining the eyelids is very vascular, and covered with papillae ("villi"), which become greatly enlarged in granular ophthalmia; the other part, covering the ball, is transparent, and over the cornea quite avascular. The " villi " (papillae) are visible with the naked eye, but are better to be looked for with a lens. 23.5. The Tarsal Cartilage and Ligament. Hunterian. FF. 8. An eyelid dissected to show the above; the eyelashes in situ, and one of the puncta lachrymalia marked with a bristle. 23.6. The Eyelids. Tarsal (Meibomian) Glands. Hunterian. FF. 9. Two pairs of eyelids injected red. The upper pair inverted, showing the orifices of the ducts of the Meibomian glands, between 30 and 40 in number, in a line along the inner edge of each eyelidâ€” in the same line as the puncta lachrymalia. 23.7. The Ducts of the Lachrymal Gland and the Meibomian Glands. Hunterian. FF. 12. A pair of eyelids, the inner canthus divided to allow them to be laid flat. Bristles are placed in two of the ducts of the lachrymal gland, near the outer canthus in the upper lid. The Meibomian glands appear faintly through the conjunctiva as yellowish streaks. The secretion is coagulated in droplets, in the orifices of the ducts of a number of them.

SERIES 16. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE SPLEEN. I. Congenital Malformations. Specimens wanted. II. Injuries of the Spleen. Specimens wanted. III. Changes due to Alterations of Nutrition and OTHER Obscure Causes, 16.1. Chronic Hypertrophy of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 15. A very large human spleen, history unknown, illustrating the above. The general shape of the viscus is preserved, though its size is six or seven times the normal. The texture of the splenic tissue is not much altered from the normal; the capsule is thick- ened, and there are numerous shreds of fibrous tissue (adhesions) on it. Probably malarial. 16.2. Chronic Hypertrophy of the Spleen. Hunterian. V. 18. An enlarged spleen of very solid texture. Microscopic examin- ation gives very little information, except that it is not amyloid. Apparently chronic enlargement with marked congestion. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 44.) Probably malarial.

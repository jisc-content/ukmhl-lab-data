THE LYMPHATICS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS. 243 trunk of the deep-seated ones of the leg; it is filled with mercury, in some places almost as large as a goose quill, is sometimes double, sometimes triple, but higher up becomes single; it appears now very tortuous, as if much longer than the artery, but the artery is much shortened from its elasticity." This vessel ter- minates in the deep inguinal or internal iliac glands, which do not appear in the specimen. Several little projections show where it received small tributaries. (c) The Lymphatics of the Genital Organs. 12.26. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Hunterian. D. 26a. A testicle and spermatic cord mounted on mica; the epididymis contains a mass of small lymphatics, which unite into five large vessels, running up the cord for about 20 cm. They are of various lengths, owing to the specimen having partly broken down and been remounted. 12.27. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Hunterian. QQ. 3. The lymphatics of the testicle were usually demonstrated by injecting mercury into the body of the organ, from which it could only escape by the lymphatics {via the epididymis and spermatic cord), owing to the strong enveloping tunica albuginea. This specimen, however, was prepared by injecting the vas deferens and tubules till some of them ruptured, when the mercury was extravasated into the stroma of the gland, and found its way out by the usual path. The lymphatics of the testicle, as might be expected from its abdominal origin, go up to the lumbar glands, which, however, are not shown in the specimen. In turpentine on blue paper. 12.28. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Hunterian. QQ. 4. Similar to the preceding. In turpentine on mica. 12.29. The Lymphatics of the Testicle. Hunterian. QQ. 5. Similar to No. 12.27.

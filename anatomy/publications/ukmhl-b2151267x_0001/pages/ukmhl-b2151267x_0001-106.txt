22 HUNTSMAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 1.107. Right Upper Extremity of a Foetus " at 5| months." Hunterian. iV! 86. Ossification in much the same stage. 1.108. Right Upper Extremity of a Foetus " at about 5| months." Hunterian. Similar to the ijreceding. (Not numbered nor described.) 1.109. Right Scapula of a Foetus "at 6 months." Hunterian. N. 87. The cartilage is now comparatively small in amount, but only one osseous centre (that from which the whole body has been formed) has appeared. 1.110. Humerus, Radius, and Ulna of a Foetus "at 9 months." Hunterian. N. 91. Appear to be very small for their age. The shafts of the bones well developed, but still no ossification in the epiphyses. 1.111. Scapula, Clavicle, and Humerus of a Foetus "at 7| months." Hunterian. N. 92. Injected red. 1.112. Humerus, Radius, and Ulna of a Foetus "at 9 months." Hunterian. N. 93. 1.113. Humerus, Radius, and Ulna of a Foetus "at 9 months." Hunterian. N. 94. 1.114. Humerus "of a Child about 2 years old." Hunterian. N. 26. Broken so as to show both ends. There is a centre of ossification about the size of a pea in the upper, and a smaller one in the lower epiphysis. This must be very nearly the first appearance of ossification in these epiphyses. Injected red and in turpentine.

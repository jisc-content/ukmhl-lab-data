21 DEVELOPMENT OF THE UPPER LIMBS. Development of the Upper Limbs. 1.101. Scapulae from very young Foetuses. Hunterian. N. 78. " Three scapulae on blue paper; the uppermost supposed at two months, the second at ten weeks, and the third certainly at twelve." Even in the smallest there is already ossification. 1.102. Right Upper Extremity "of a Foetus at 3 months." Himterian. N. 79. The bones of the above, carefully dissected, dried, and on blue paper. The ossification is well advanced in all the shafts, even in the phalanges. The epiphyses are shrivelled up. Compare next specimen. 1.103. Left Upper Extremity "of a Foetus at 3 months." Hunterian. N. 80. The fellow of the preceding. Being mounted in spirit the epiphyses are well preserved. None of them nor of the carpal bones show centres of ossification. 1.104. Left Upper Extremity of a Foetus "between 3 and 4 months." Hunterian. N. 83. Similar to the preceding. The scapula wanting. 1.105. Left Upper Extremity of a Foetus "at 4 months." Hunterian. N. 84. A very perfect skeleton, all the soft parts except the ligaments cleanly dissected away. Showing all the centres of ossification from the clavicle and scapula to the last phalanges; none in the epiphyses yet. 1.106. Right Upper Extremity of a Foetus "at 4 months." Hunterian. N. 85. Fellow of the preceding, dried and mounted in turpentine. Too much cleared and the epiphyses shrivelled.

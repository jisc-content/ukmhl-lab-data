INFLAMMATION OF BONE. 107 5.96. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Extensive Rarefaction and Necrosis of Stump. Hunkrian. The greater part of a femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. There is an annular sequestrum (part in front broken off and lost) of about 1 cm. of the dense shaft nearly separated, but above that there is more or less rarefaction of the shaft extending up to the anatomical neck, most advanced in front, but quite evident behind and inside also. The specimen was probably obtained on the death of the patient from pyaemia or exhaustion. There is no trace of periosteal new-formation of bone; probably an acute case. 5.97. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Extensive Necrosis of Stump. Hunterian. Upper two-thirds of a femur macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The specimen shows an enormous sequestrum extending from the end of the stump to the surgical neck. The process of separation is far advanced, and the groove well marked. Above it there has been rarefaction, and some periosteal new-formation. Probably obtained after the death of the patient from pyaemia or exhaustion by long continued suppuration. 5.98. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Necrosis and Separation of Small Sequestrum. Hunterian. LL. 52. "A portion of the thigh bone from an old soldier, where the leg had been amputated above the knee. There is a considerable thickening from ossification at the end of the stump, and a small piece of bone is exfoliating." The sequestrum, which had doubtless acted as a source of irritation for a long period, is almost separated. After this had occurred there would probably have been sound healing, as the bone above appears tolerably healthy. 5.99. Septic Osteomyelitis after Amputation. Extensive Necrosis. Formation of New Shaft around Se- questrum. Hunterian. LL. 59. Portion of bone from a stump, cleaned and mounted in spirit, showing the above. There is a large quite loose sequestrum,

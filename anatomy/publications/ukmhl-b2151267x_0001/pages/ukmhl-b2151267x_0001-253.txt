169 ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. The old cotyloid notch and fossa for the ligamentum teres form a triangular pit below and scarcely demarcated from the lower part of the new acetabulum. 6.71. Arthritis Deformans of the Hip-joint. Hunterian. Left innominate bone, probably from a grave, illustrating the above. The acetabulum is somewhat deepened, and the upper part of its floor scored and eburnated. There are also considerable masses of irregular new-formed bone, which was beginning to extend over the fossa for the ligamentum teres; compare No. 6. 79, under Lateral Curvature of the Spine. There are also some periostitic nodules round the edges of the bone; there are several round holes in the shell with wider excavation of the cancellous tissue, which were possibly the seat of secondary carcinomata in the medulla. For Arthritis Deformans of the Hip-joint associated with Intra- capsular Fracture, see Nos. 3.45 and 3.46. 6.72. Arthritis Deformans of the Elbow, Advanced. Hunterian. Right humerus, radius, and ulna macerated and dried, illustrating the above. All the articular surfaces are greatly altered in shape. The head of the radius is of an ovoid shape, flattened and eburnated in front. It is bent backwards just above the bicipital tubercle. The greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna is increased in depth and width, the osseous outgrowths being particularly large around the coronoid process. The articular surfaces of the humerus are altered correspondingly. The flat eburnated surface for the radius is towards the front. The movements of the joint, to judge by the way the bones fit to one another, were very limited. Extension beyond the point of semi-flexion must have been impossible on account of the interlocking. 6.73. Arthritis Deformans of the Elbow. Advanced. Hunterian. Right humerus, radius, and ulna macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces are much altered ; the sigmoid cavity of the ulna in this case is very shallow, as if flattened out.

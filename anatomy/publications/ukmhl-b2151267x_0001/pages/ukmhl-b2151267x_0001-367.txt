THE NASO-PHARYNX AND LARYNX. 283 little behind the ^nd of the nasal septum, showing the nasal fossae from before and behind. Bristles are passed from behind into the superior meatus, and that in the left projects in front, the section having cut away its blind anterior end. Bristles also pass on each side by the vidian canal, and by the foramen for the pharyngeal branch of Meckel's ganglion, from the spheno-maxillary fossa to appear on the cut surface of the basi-sphenoid. The nasal mucous membrane is about the natural healthy thickness. The septum is remarkably straight. 17.13. The Cavities of the Nose. Hunterian. GG. 9. Vertical tranverse section of the nose and roof of the mouth, including about 2 cm. of the middle region of the nose; the left second molar remaining indicates the position of the section. The posterior halves of the orbits are included, and the antra are freely opened in front. The mucous membrane on the right turbinate bones and right side of the septum is somewhat hyper- trpphied. The septum is deflected to the left. (6) The Larynx, Trachea and Bronchi. 17.14. The Naso-pharynx and Orifice of the Larynx. Hunterian. GG. 45. The larynx, tongue, pharynx, soft palate, and pillars of the fauces, with the pharynx opened behind to give a view of the relations of the last four to the epiglottis and larynx. The uvula is turned forward, and the epiglottis rather pressed down. The soft parts have been cleared away from the outside of the hyoid bone and cartilages of the larynx. The relations of these structures are also well shown in No. 21.50, which see. 17.15. The Naso-pharynx and Orifice of the Larynx. Hunterian. GG. 46. A similar specimen injected red. The uvula and soft palate are pressed down in front of the epiglottis, quite shutting off the respiratory passages from the mouth. The epiglottis is erect, and the orifice of the larynx open. The thyroid gland is dissected clear in front. Compare No. 21.50.

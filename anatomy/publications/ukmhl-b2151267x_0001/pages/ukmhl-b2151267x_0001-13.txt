1, PREFACE. Dr. W. Hunter in his will left it a charge to his trustees to prepare, or to cause to be prepared, catalogues of the whole museum, or to revise and complete such catalogues as had been already prepared or were in course of preparation. He had himself prepared a catalogue of the greater part of the anatomical and pathological collection; two copies of this were transmitted to Glasgow with the museum. These are in two thick folio volumes, for the most part neatly written in the same handwriting; the one " seems to be a literal transcript of the other, preserving faithfully the most palpable mistakes." The writer was a good penman, but not technically instructed; the text abounds in errors in the spelling of scientific terms, and even of common words. These errors are in many cases such as an ill-educated amanuensis might commit in writing to dictation ; but there are others the work of an ignorant copyist. As many of these errors occur in both copies, it appears as if both had been copied from another MS.; indeed, earlier catalogues still exist in the museum. It seems, therefore, that this is the last edition of a work gradually compiled during the forty years occupied by the formation of the museum. There is no certainty as to who the amanuensis was. The one volume is new and fresh both internally and externally; the other is old and worn by use. The older copy contains altera- tions and corrections of descriptions, and many additional descriptions interlined, all in Hunter's handwriting; apparently it was the copy used by Dr. Hunter himself. The interlined descriptions have been added to the newer copy by being written on slips of paper and pasted in at their proper places ; the handwriting of these slips has not been identified. The corrections in the matter of the text are not numerous; of merely clerical errors there are no corrections in

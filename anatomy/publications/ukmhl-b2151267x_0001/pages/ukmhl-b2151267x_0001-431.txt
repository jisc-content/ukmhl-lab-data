347 THE EYEBALL. 23.12. The Arteries of the Eye. â€” The optic nerve, back of eyeball, and adjacent soft tissues injected red, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing the branches of the ophthalmic artery going to the eye. 23.13. The Sclerotic and Choroid Coats of the Eye. Hunterian. FF. 19. An eyeball with the sclerotic divided all round and turned up, showing the choroid. The arteries are injected red, the veins white. The latter, from the manner of their distribution, are called the vasa vorticosa. The arteries, on the other hand, run nearly straight from back to front of the ball. 23.14. The Arteries of the Choroid. Hunterian. An eye hung by the optic nerve, the ophthalmic artery and veins injected red. The sclerotic for the most part is dissected off, showing the choroid with its arteries and veins finely injected. The former are recognized by their straight course round the ball from back to front, the latter by their vorticose arrangement. 23.15. The Blood-vessels of the Choroid. Hunterian. FF. 20. The sclerotic, choroid, and iris of an eyeball injected red, dried and mounted in turpentine, showing that the choroid is the vascular layer of the eyeball. There are very few vessels in the sclerotic, and none in the cornea. 23.16. The Anterior Chamber of the Eye, the Ciliary Body and the Iris. Hunterian. FF. 23. An eye with part of the cornea and sclerotic turned up, showing the above, and the relations of the choroid, iris, and crystalline lens. The anterior chamber is the space, containing the aqueous humour, which lies between the cornea and the front of the crystalline body or lens; theoretically it is divided, as by a diaphragm, by the iris, which, however, really lies in close contact with the lens, though not attached to it. Through the pupil is seen the central portion of the lens. The white ring round the iris

STRUCTURE OF JOINTS IN GENERAL. 35 2.6. Vascularity of Synovial Membrane. Hunterian. L. 6. A finger from an injected hand, the articulations laid open before, to show the same things as the preceding. Injected as usual with vermilion. 2.7. Vascularity of Synovial Membranes. Hunterian. L. 15. Lower ends of the tibia and fibula showing the articular surfaces of the ankle; the synovial fringes and adjacent soft parts beauti- fully injected red, while the avascular articular cartilages remain pure white. B. Particular Joints. 2.8. The Intervertebral Substance. Hunterian. M. 1. "A lumbar vertebra, with two of the intervertebral substances, showing that substance half an inch thick. It is made up externally of the same kind of white silver-coloured fibres as tendon, which de- cussate one another in many places." 2.9. The Intervertebral Substance. Hunterian. M. la. A section of " a lumbar vertebra from the sea-cow" (Dugong) showing the external firm fibrous, and the central soft gelatinous substances composing the above. 2.10. The Intervertebral Substance. Hunterian. M. 2. Lumbar vertebra " from the sea-cow," showing on one end of the body the intervertebral substance as in the preceding, and on the other the intervertebral disc of cartilage. In the adult human sub- ject this disc behaves as an epiphysis, ossifies and becomes incor- porated with the body of the vertebra. 2.11. The Intervertebral Substances. Hunterian. M. 3. " The spine of a young child, showing that the intervertebral sub- stance is thinnest in the neck, and becomes gradually thicker to the upper end of the sacrum ; shows also the external decussating liga- mentous fibres of these subscances the whole way."

442 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. longitu- dinal are on bodies of verte- brae. Veins of the ver- tebrae. Poste- rior spinal veins are in con- tact with arches. vertebrae, one on each side of the posterior common ligament uniting those bones; and are irregular in outline, owing to certain constrictions near the intervertebral foramina. They receive op- posite the body of each vertebra the vein from that bone; and they send outwards, through the intervertebral foramina, branches of communication with the veins outside the spine in the neck, the dorsal region, and the loins. b. Veins of the bodies of the vertebra.— Within the canals in the bodies of the vertebrae are contained large veins, that join on the front of each vertebra with veins in that situation ; and unite to- gether, behind, into one trunk, which passes from the bone by the large aperture on the posterior surface. Escaped from the bone, the trunk divides into two branches that diverge,— one to the right another to the left, and open into the large longitudinal veins. c. The posterior spinal veins form a plexus between the dura mater and the arches of the vertebrae. A large vein may be said to lie on each side of the middle line, which joins freely with its fellow, and with the anterior longitudinal vein by lateral branches. Into this plexus the small veins on the outside of the neural arches pour their contents. Branches from these vessels are directed to the intervertebral foramina, where they end in the veins at the roots of the transverse processes.

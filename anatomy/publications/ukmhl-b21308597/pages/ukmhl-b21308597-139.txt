123 INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION. usually on or near the inferior thyroid artery. It is of a roundish shape, and lies beneath the great cervical vessels. Its branches are the following : —• Connecting branches with the spinal nerves pass outwards, and sink between the borders of the longus colli and anterior scalenus to join the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Branches for Distribution.—These consist of nerves to the thyroid body, together with the middle cardiac nerve. 1. The thyroid branches ramify around the inferior thyroid artery, and end in the thyroid body; they join the external laryn- geal and recurrent laryngeal nerves. 2. The middle or great cardiac nerve descends to the thorax across the subclavian artery ; its termination in the cardiac plexus will be seen in the chest. In the neck it communicates with the upper cardiac and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The inferior cervical ganglion is irregular in shape, and occupies the interval between the first rib and the trans- verse process of the last cervical vertebra, its position being internal to the superior intercostal artery. Oftentimes it extends in front of the neck of the rib, and joins the first swelling of the knotted cord in the thorax. One or two filaments around the trunk of the subclavian artery likewise connect these ganglia, and supply filaments to that blood- vessel. Its branches are very similar to those of the other ganglia. Connecting branches join the last two cervical nerves. Other nerves accompany the vertebral artery in its canal, forming a plexus — vertebral, around it, and communicate with the spinal nerves as high as the fourth. Only one branch for distribution, the inferior cardiac nerve, issues from the lower ganglion. It lies beneath the subclavian artery, joining in that position .the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and then enters the thorax to terminate in the deep cardiac plexus behind the arch of the aorta.

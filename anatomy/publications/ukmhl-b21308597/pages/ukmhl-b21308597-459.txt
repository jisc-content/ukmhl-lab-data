Directions. — The perinaeum may be allotted with greatest advantage to the dissector of the abdomen ; and its exami- nation should be made before that of the abdomen, as the distinctness of many of the parts is destroyed soon after death. Before the body is placed in the position suited for the dissection, the student may practise passing the catheter along the urethra. Position of the body. — Whilst the body lies on the back it is to be drawn to the end of the dissecting table, till the buttocks hang slightly over the edge. A moderately-sized block is then to be placed beneath the pelvis, to raise the perinaeum to a convenient height. The legs are to be raised and kept out of the way by the following means : — After the thighs are bent upon the trunk, and the knees also bent, the limbs are to be fastened in that position with a cord. For this purpose make one or two turns of the cord round one bent knee (say the right), carry the cord beneath the table, and encircling the opposite limb in the same manner, fasten it finally round the right knee. When the position has been arranged, let the student raise the scrotum, and place a small bit of cotton wool or tow within the anus, but let him avoid distending the rectum. Superficial limits, and marking of the surface. — The perinaBal space in the male is limited, on the surface of the body, by the scrotum in front, and by the thighs and buttocks on the sides and behind. This region is of a dark colour, and is covered with hairs. About its centre is the aperture Before the dis- section pass ca- theter. Place the body in posi- tion. and fasten upwards the legs.

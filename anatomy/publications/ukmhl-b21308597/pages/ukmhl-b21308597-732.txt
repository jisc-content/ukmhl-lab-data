In the leg the vein is joined by superficial branches, and by deep roots from the tibial veins. External The external saphenous vein begins at the outer end of saphe- r ° nous- the arch on the dorsum of the foot, and appears below the outer ankle. The vein then courses along the back of the leg to the ham, where it ends in the popliteal vein. It receives large branches about the heel, and others on the back of the leg. cutane- Cutaneous Nerves. — The nerves in the superficial fascia nerves, of the back of the leg are prolongations of branches already examined in part, viz. the internal and external saphenous, cutaneous offsets of the external popliteal, the small sciatic nerve, and offsets of the internal cutaneous of the thigh. internal The internal saphenous nerve, which has been traced before to nous in the knee (p. 681.), accompanies the vein of the same name in the the leg. i and terminates at the middle of the inner border of the foot.

External The external saphenous nerve is a branch of the internal popliteal nous (p. 708.) ; perforating the deep fascia about the middle of the leg, the foot j it is continued with the external saphenous vein below the outer ankle, and is distributed to the outer side of the foot and little toe. branches As soon as the nerve appears it is joined by the communicating leg1' 6 branch of the external popliteal, and near the heel it gives large long branches to the integuments of that part. Branch- Cutaneous nerves of the external popliteal.— One branch of the the external popliteal trunk (r. comnmnicans fibularis, p. 709.) joins popliteal, the external saphenous nerve, usually, about the middle of the leg*; nicating but ^ no^ uncommon find this branch extend as a distinct nerve, unconnected with the other, as far as the heel.

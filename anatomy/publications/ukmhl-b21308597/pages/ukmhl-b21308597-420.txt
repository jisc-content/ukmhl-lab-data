According to the mode of dividing the body, the dissection of the back will in one school be allotted to one student; and in another School it will be undertaken conjointly by the dissectors of the head and the upper limbs,— one preparing the cervical, the others the dorsal and lumbar regions. If the last arrangement should be the one adopted as in this school, the dissector of the upper limb may give his atten- tion only to those paragraphs that are marked with an asterisk; and the dissector of the neck may take specially the paragraphs which are not so marked. * Position.—For this dissection the body lies with the face downwards ; and the trunk is to be raised by blocks beneath the chest and the pelvis, so that the limbs may hang over the end and sides of the dissecting table. To make tense the neck, the head is to be depressed and fastened with hooks. * Dissection.—In the back the student will meet with suc- cessive strata of large muscles, five in all, amongst which vessels and nerves are interspersed. The first step in the dissection is to raise the skin from the surface in two flaps, by means of the following incisions: — One cut is to be made along the middle line of the body, from the occipital protuberance to the back of the sacrum : another incision is to be carried from the last dorsal verte- bra to the acromion process of the scapula. The flap of skin above the last cut is to be turned outwards by both dissectors. The remaining piece of integument is to be detached by a transverse incision opposite the crest of the ilium, and then to be reflected by the dissector of the upper limb in the same direction as the other flap. Under the upper flap of skin is the trapezius, and underneath the lower one is the latissimus dorsi muscle. The cutaneous nerves may be now sought in the subcu- Seek

DEMONSTRATIONS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Directions. — In the dissection of the head and neck, the student should endeavour to learn the anatomy of the parts described in the first sixty pages before the first position of the body is changed; but should want of time necessitate an omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 39.) can be best deferred till a subsequent stage. The orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck, as well as the objects on the exterior and interior of the head, should be examined whilst the body lies on the back. Position. — During the examination of the superficial parts of the head, the body lies on the back, and the head, raised to a suitable height, is to be turned to the right side. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Muscles of the external Ear. — Three muscles attach the outer ear to the side of the head. Two are above it, one elevating, the other drawing it forwards ; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards described. Parts to be learnt before the body is turn- ed. Position of the body. Muscles of the ear.

Inter- costal artery. muscles, which are connected with the hinder part of the ribs. Each, except the first, arises from the apex and lower border of the transverse process of a dorsal vertebra, and is inserted, the fibres spreading out, into the upper border of the rib beneath, from the tubercle to the angle. The muscles increase in size from above down, and their fibres have the same direction as the external intercostal layer. The first is fixed above to the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and below to the outer surface of the first rib. In some of the four lower muscles a few fibres are con- tinued beyond one rib to that next succeeding. These longer slips have been named levatores longiores costarum. * The external intercostal muscle is continued backwards along the ribs as far as the tubercle, and is overlaid by the elevator muscle. Beneath this outer muscle are the inter- costal nerve and artery. * Dissection.â€” To trace the anterior and posterior primary branches of the dorsal nerves to their origin in a common trunk, the elevator of the rib and the external intercostal muscle are to be cut through in one or more spaces. The intercostal artery, with its posterior branch, is laid bare at the same time. * The dorsal nerves can be now seen to split in the inter- vertebral foramina into anterior and posterior primary branches. * The posterior branches are directed backwards, internal to the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and have been already examined (p. 420.). * The anterior is named intercostal, and is continued between the ribs, to the front of the chest. Its anatomy is learnt in the dissection of the thorax (p. 267.). * The intercostal artery has an almost exact corre- spondence with the dorsal nerve in its branching and distribution.

CHAPTER XI. DISSECTION OF THE EAR. The organ of hearing is made up of many complex parts, which are lodged in, or are attached to the surface of the temporal bone. The sentient structure in this organ, as in the eyeball, is an expansion of a special nerve over a membrane containing fluid. For protection this structure is enclosed in bone. It is surrounded by certain accessory bodies which collect, and convey to it the undulations of sound. The several parts constituting the auditory apparatus may be arranged into those outside, and those within the sub- stance of the temporal bone. A. The external set (outer ear), which may be first ex- amined, include the pinna or auricle, and the auditory canal: the former has been noticed at page 37., and the latter is de- scribed below. The auditory canal {meatus auditorius externus) is the passage which leads from the pinna to a cavity in the tem- poral bone named the tympanum, and transmits inwards sounds. Dissection. â€” To obtain a view of this canal, a recent tem- poral bone is to be taken, to which the cartilaginous pinna remains attached. After the soft parts are removed, the squamous part of the bone in front of the Glasserian fissure is to be sawn off; and the fore part of the meatus, except the portion below that gives support to the thin membrana tympani, is to be cut away with a bone forceps. This canal is about one inch and a quarter in length, and is formed partly by bone, and partly by cartilage and mem- brane. It is directed forwards somewhat obliquely ; and is sometimes bent downwards rather beyond the middle, so that the floor slopes from that spot both outwards and in- wards. In shape it is rather flattened from before back- Defini- tion. Outline of the elements of the organ of hearing. Ar- range- ' ment into two sets. Outer set. Audi- tory canal.

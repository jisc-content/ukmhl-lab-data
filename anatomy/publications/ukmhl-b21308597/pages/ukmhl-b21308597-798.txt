DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 782 Form of the la. minas; con- structed of mi- nute fibres that are wavy at the edge, and at- tached so the septa by their ends. Changes in situa- tion ; form, colour, and consist- ence. structed of minute parallel fibres. No bloodvessels are found in its texture. It consists mostly of albumen. The lamince of each surface have their apices in the centre, where the septa meet, and may be detached from one another at that spot, and turned outwards. The constituent fibres of the laminae are about 3~oVoth of an inch in diameter, solid and rather flat, and most flattened at the margin of the lens. The deeper fibres are narrowed and less distinct. The edges are slightly wavy, and each fibre touches six others; viz. two on each side, one above, and another below; contiguous fibres are therefore dovetailed together, and this interlocking is best seen in the lens of the codfish. They are connected at their extremities to the partitions on the opposite surfaces of the lens in this way: those that are at- tached to the pole or the spot where the septa meet on the one aspect, are fixed to the extremity of a septum on the other aspect; and the rest of the fibres passing between two septa, begin and end at points that are not corresponding. Changes with age.â€”In infancy the lens is situate further forwards than in adult age, and touches the iris. Its form is nearly spherical in the fetus, but its convexity decreases with age, particularly on the anterior aspect, until the lens becomes flattened in old people. In the fetus it is reddish in colour, is soft, and is not quite transparent; in youth and mature age it is firm and clear; and in old age it becomes denser and of a yellowish colour.

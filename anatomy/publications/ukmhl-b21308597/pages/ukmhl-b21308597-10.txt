PREFACE. VI the progressive stages of a dissection have also under- gone careful revision, and are better adapted to aid the student in following the more difficult directions, and to assist him in distinguishing objects which become visible on the removal of the superficial parts. Little alteration can be made in each forthcoming edition of a work on Practical Anatomy. The chief additions to this volume are included in the account of the structure of the urinary and generative organs, and the organs of the senses. G.V.E. . \ University College, London . Nov. 1856.

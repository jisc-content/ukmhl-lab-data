DISSECTION' OF THE ABD05IEX. 472 To de- fine ab- On side three cies,mus’ men are three large On the right side, the margin of the external abdominal dominai ring may be defined to show the cord passing through it; and on the left side, a thin fascia (intercolumnar), which is connected with the margin of that opening, is to be pre- served. Lastly, the dissector should make evident the free margin of the external oblique muscle between the last rib and the crest of the ilium.

The most superficial muscle is the external oblique, the next one the internal oblique, and the last is the trans- and their versalis.

The external oblique muscle is fleshy on the side, and muscle is aponeurotic on the fore part of the abdomen. It arises by Origin fleshy points or digitations from the eight lower ribs ; the ribs*1 highest five pieces, which are attached to the outer surface and the borders of the ribs, alternate with similar parts of the serratus magnus; and the lowest three, connected with the costal margins, interdigitate with the processes of origin of the latissimus dorsi muscle. From the attachment to the ribs, the fibres are directed over the side of the abdomen in the following manner: — the lower fibres descend almost inser- vertically to be inserted into the anterior half or more of tioninto . ... pelvis the iliac crest, at the outer margin; whilst the upper and alba. middle fibres are continued forwards, the one set horizontally, the other obliquely, to the aponeurosis on the front of the belly. Aponeu- The aponeurosis of the muscle occupies the anterior part rosis of the mus- of the abdomen, in front of a line from the eighth rib to the cle . ° covers crista ilii, and is rather narrower about the centre, than the belly, either above or below. Along the middle line of the body this expansion ends in the linea alba, — the common point of union of the aponeuroses of opposite sides. Above, it is thin, and is continued on the rectus muscle to the pectoralis major and the ribs. Below, the fibres of the aponeurosis are stronger and more separate than above, and are directed obliquely downwards and inwards to the pelvis: some of Disposi- tion above and be- low.

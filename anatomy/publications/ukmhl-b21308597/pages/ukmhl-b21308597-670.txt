Hollow of Scar- pa’s space. Groove All the parts described in Section I. are to be examined before the time for turning the body arrives. Position.—During the dissection of the front of the thigh the body should lie on the back, with a block of a suitable size beneath the pelvis, and the lower limbs should hang over the end of the dissecting table. The limb is to be rotated outwards, so as to make evident a hollow at the upper part of the thigh; and is to be supported in a half bent position by means of a stool beneath the foot. Surface marking.—Before any of the integument is re- moved from the limb, the student is to observe the chief markings and eminences on the surface of the thigh. The limit between the thigh and the abdomen is marked in front by the firm band of Poupart’s ligament inter- vening between the crest of the hip bone and the pubes. On the outer side the division is indicated by the convexity of the iliac crest of the innominate bone, which subsides behind in the sacrum and coccyx; and on the inner side, by the projection of the pubes, from which a line of bone (pubic arch) may be traced backwards along the inner and upper part of the limb to the ischial tuberosity. On the anterior aspect of the thigh, and close to Poupart’s ligament, is a slight hollow, corresponding with the triangular space of Scarpa, in which the larger vessels of the limb are contained ; and extending thence obliquely along the inner side of the limb, is a slight depression marking the situation of the femoral artery beneath: the position of this arterial k

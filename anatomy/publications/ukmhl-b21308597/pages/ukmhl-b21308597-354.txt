DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 338 1 ateral and inferior liga- ment. Surface of the bones. The lateral ligaments are triangular in form ; each is con- nected by its apex to the side of the phalanx near the an- terior part, and by its base, to the inferior ligament. The inferior ligament has the same mode of attachment between the extremities of the bones as in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, but it is not so strong as in that articulation. There is a simple synovial membrane present in the joint. The articulation of the second with the last phalanx is like the preceding joint, both in the number and disposition of its ligaments, and in the surfaces of the bones; but all the articular parts are much less strongly marked. Articular Surfaces. â€” The anterior end of each phalanx is marked by a pulley-like surface. The posterior end of the phalanx presents a transversely hollowed fossa, and is pro- vided with a crest which fits into the central depression of the opposite articular surface in the movements of the joint.

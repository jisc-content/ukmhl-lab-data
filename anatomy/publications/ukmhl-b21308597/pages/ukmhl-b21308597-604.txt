The cavity of the pelvis is but a part of the general abdo- minal space (p. 499.), and is situate below the brim or inlet of the true pelvis. Boundaries. — The space is surrounded by the firm bony ring of the pelvic bones, and therefore admits of little alter- ation in its form or capacity. Behind it is bounded by the sacrum and the coccyx with the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and, laterally and in front by the innominate bones covered by the obturator muscles. Inferiorly, or towards the perinaeum, the cavity is limited by the fascia reflected from the wall to the viscera, and by the levatores ani and coccygei muscles: it is only in this last direction, where the bounding struc- tures are moveable, that alterations can be made in the capacity of the space. Contents. — In the interior are contained the urinary bladder, the lower end of the large intestine, or the rectum, and some of the generative organs according to the sex. All these parts have vessels, nerves, and lymphatics dis- tributed to them, and the serous membrane is reflected over them. Section L FASCIA OF THE PELVIS AND MUSCLES OF THE OUTLET. On the wall of the pelvis is a thin fascia (pelvic), which extends from the brim to the outlet, and covers the obturator muscle. At a certain level a visceral portion is directed in- wards from it to the rectum and the bladder, and this is named recto-vesical fascia from the viscera with which it is connected. Dissection.— To bring into view the parietal part, or the pelvic fascia, the external iliac vessels, and the psoas if this has not been removed in the dissection of the lumbar plexus, are to be taken away on the left side of the body.

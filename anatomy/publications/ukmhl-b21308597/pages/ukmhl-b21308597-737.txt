The tibialis posticus occupies superiorly the interval Tibialis covers between the bones of the leg, but it crosses inferiorly beneath interos- seous the long flexor of the toes to reach the inner side of the foot. mem. The muscle arises from the aponeurosis covering it, and from the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane, except about two inches below; from an impression along the outer border of the tibia, contiguous to the interosseous membrane, which reaches from the head of the bone to rather beyond the lower attachment of the flexor longus digitorum; and from the adjacent inner surface of the fibula for the middle three fifths of its length. In the lower crosses beneath fourth of the leg this muscle is directed beneath the flexor the ° < # flexor of digitorum; and its tendon entering the inner space in the the toes, annular ligament, reaches the inner side of the foot to be inserted into the scaphoid and other bones.

At its origin the artery lies midway between the tibia Course, and fibula, but as it approaches the lower part of the leg it gradually inclines inwards; and at its termination it is placed below the tibia, in the centre of the hollow between the heel and the inner ankle.

341 CHAPTER IV. DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Section I. CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The cavity of the thorax is the space included by the spinal Defini- column, the ribs, and the sternum, and by certain muscles that close the intervals between the pieces of the bony frame- work. In it the organs of respiration, and the heart with its con- great vessels are lodged ; and through it the gullet, and some nerves and vessels are transmitted. Dissection.— When the parts that cover in front the bony Dissec. parietes of the thorax have been examined and taken away, open the cavity is to be opened by removing a part of the anterior boundary. To make a sufficient opening into the thorax, the sternum is to be sawn through opposite the interval between the first two ribs, and again between the insertion of the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs. After detach- ing the lining membrane (pleura) from the inner surface of the chest, the student is to cut through all the true ribs except the first and seventh *, as far back as he can con- veniently reach. The loose sternum and the ribs can bev re- moved, by dividing the intercostal muscles in the first and sixth spaces. The internal mammary artery may now be cut across, and the bag of the pleura opened : when this has been done, the cavity with its contents will be ready for ex- amination. The sternum and the cartilages of the ribs will be required tsot®renum hereafter for the dissection of the ligaments. kept. Form. — The cavity is of the same general form as Form in J # ° general. the thorax, that is to say, irregularly conical, with the apex * The student must be mindful to leave those ribs uncut: the divi- sion of them will not be advantageous to his own part, and will interfere with the dissection of the neck and abdomen. z 3

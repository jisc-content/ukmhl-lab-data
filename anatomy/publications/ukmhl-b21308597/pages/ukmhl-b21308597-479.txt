Afterwards the trunks of those vessels, and of ihe pudic nerve, are to be traced backwards. The deep transverse muscle (depressor urethras, San- Deep v . trans- torini) has the same origin externally as in the male, and it meets its fellow at the middle line. Santorini described the muscle as passing over, instead of below the urethra; hence the name given to it by its discoverer. The constrictor muscle of the urethra resembles that Cop- strictor of the male in its origin from the pubes, and its disposition urethrae, around the urethra. Within it is also a circular layer of involuntary fibres of the urethra, as in the other sex. The description of the pudic artery (p. 458.) will serve Pudic for both sexes, except that the branch in the female, corre- sponding to the artery of the bulb in the male, is furnished to the vagina. The terminal branches are much smaller too in the female. The pudic nerve has the same peculiarity as the artery Pudic with respect to the branches to the vagina, and the smaller size of the terminal part of the nerve on the clitoris. vessels. nerve.

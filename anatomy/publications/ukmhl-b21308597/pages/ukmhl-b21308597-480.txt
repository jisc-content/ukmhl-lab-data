WALL OF THE ABDOMEN. The dissector of the abdomen may be reminded that the perinaeum is included in the part of the body assigned to him. And he is to keep in mind that he has not only to finish the examination of that region, but to proceed as far as the end of Section III. before the body is turned for the dissection of the back. Position. — The body will be sufficiently raised by the blocks placed beneath the thorax and buttocks, according to the directions given in the dissection of the limbs ; but the dissector should see that the chest is higher than the pelvis. After the abdomen has been inflated by an aperture through the umbilicus, let the markings on the surface be first attended to. Surface-marking. — On its anterior aspect, the abdomen is for the most part convex, especially in fat bodies ; whilst on the sides, between the ribs and the crista ilii, the surface is somewhat depressed. Along the middle line is a slight groove, corresponding to the linea alba, which presents about its centre the excavation of the umbilicus. Inferiorly the groove ceases a little above the pelvis in the prominence of the pubes; and superiorly it subsides below the ensiform cartilage in a hollow named the epigastric fossa. On each side of the middle line is the projection of the rectus muscle, and this is intersected in young and well-formed bodies by two or three transverse depressions. Underneath the eminence of the pubes the student will be able to recognise with his finger the symphysis pubis, and to trace outwards from it the contiguous pubic crest which leads to the spinous process. If the finger is still carried outwards

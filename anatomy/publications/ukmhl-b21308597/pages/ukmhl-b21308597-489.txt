Its posterior connec- border is usually free between the last rib and the iliac crest, but it is commonly overlaid by the edge of the latis- simus dorsi, except a small part below. Appearing through Lines on the aponeurosis, external to the lmea alba, is a white line, neurosis, the linea semilunaris, corresponding to the outer edge of the rectus muscle; and crossing between the two are three or four whitish marks, the lineae transversse.

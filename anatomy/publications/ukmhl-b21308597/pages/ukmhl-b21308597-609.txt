The sheath that is prolonged on the gut becomes thin towards the anus ; whilst that on the prostate is separated from its viscus by a plexus of veins (prostatic), and sends an offset backwards to incase the vesiculae seminales. The recto-vesical fascia forms a par- and , . . forms tition, like that of the levatores ani muscles, across the part of the floor pelvis, which is perforated by the prostate and the rectum; of the but in the case of the fascia the viscera receive sheaths from the membrane as they pass through it. In the female the fascia has much the same arrangement Fascia as in the male ; but the vagina, instead of the prostate, per- female, forates the membrane, and receives a tube from it. The true ligaments of the bladder are two on each side, Pieces of the anterior and lateral, and are derived from the recto-vesical fascia fascia. a. The anterior reaches from the posterior aspect of the form the anterior pubes to the upper surface of the prostate, and the neck of the bladder: it is a narrow white band, and encloses some muscular fibres of the bladder. Between the ligaments of opposite sides, the recto-vesical fascia dips down to reach the apex of the prostate. b. The lateral ligament is a piece of the same fascia, which and is fixed to the lateral part of the prostate gland, at the upper iiga- IT10H Is border, and to the side of the bladder on the same level. of the There are other ligaments of the bladder (false ligaments), False which are derived from the peritoneum investing it, and will be seen in the following section. ments of bladder.

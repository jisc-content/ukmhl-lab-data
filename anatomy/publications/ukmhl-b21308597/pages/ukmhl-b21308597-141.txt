125 LEFT SUBCLAVIAN AND CAROTID ARTERIES. hyoid, and thyroid muscles. Behind the vessel is the longus colli muscle, with the inferior ganglion of the sym- pathetic. To the inner side are the oesophagus and the thoracic duct; and the pleura is in contact with the anterior and outer parts. Its connections lower in the chest are de- scribed in the dissection of the thorax. The pneumo-gastric nerve is in connection with this part Position of the artery, but its position is parallel to the vessel instead ° vag l of across it, as on the right side. The internal jugular vein, and in- in like manner, is parallel to the artery for a short distance, jugular • • • vein to and superficial to it. Accompanying also the subclavian it. artery are the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, which course along the side of the vessel to the chest. The second and third parts of the artery, viz. beneath and Rest of beyond the scalenus, are nearly the same as on the right side ; tery. but the student must note for himself the variations that may exist in the connections. The branches of this artery resemble so closely those of Branch- 6S re- the right trunk, that one description will serve for both. It sembie may be remarked, that the superior intercostal of the left right # • . vessel. side is usually internal to, instead of beneath the scalenus; in other words, this branch arises sooner (see p. 75.). The thoracic duct conveys the chyle and lymph of the Thoracic greater part of the body into the venous circulation. Es- come3 caping from the thorax between the subclavian artery and [™0™ax the oesophagus, the duct ascends in the neck as high as the seventh or sixth cervical vertebra. At the spot mentioned as its highest extent, the duct arches outwards above the subclavian artery, and in front of the scalenus muscle and the phrenic nerve, to open into the subclavian vein rather and joins external to the union of this with the jugular vein. Double S*3" valves, like those of the veins, are present in the interior of vein' the tube ; and two guard the opening into the posterior part of the vein, to prevent the passage of the blood into it. Commonly the upper part of the duct is divided; and there may be separate openings in the large vein, corresponding to those divisions.

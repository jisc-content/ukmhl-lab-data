44 some weight might be allowed to it; but when it is known that six individuals have erected an edifice, highly ornamental to the city, out of their own funds ; that five of these indivi- duals have been almost their whole lives citizens of, and resi- dent in New-York ; and that four out of the six have, during fifteen or twenty years past been distinguished as teachers of medicine in the College of the state, while but one of the num- ber has come from another state or city of the Union, will not the public duly appreciate the disinterestedness and genuine- ness of that patriotism, which is so sensitive in relation to foreign influence, as to discover that those who have taught as Americans and citizens of New-York in one street, have become expatriated and disfranchised by instructing pupils in another ? The threats and clamours about foreign influence, with a view, if possible, to prevent competition of talent, are so en- tirely ignoble, so far from the course which men of generous emulation should pursue, so utterly repugnant to the constitu- tion of our country and the spirit of the people, that we can scarcely imagine any thing more absurd, unless it be, that the legislature should grant the monopoly desired, and proclaim that henceforward votaries of science, and men emulous of fame, should neither dare to seek for reputation nor subsistence within our borders, but depart to other regions, where mind is free, talent at liberty to develope its strength and useful- ness, and where the dominion of dulness cannot, by any possi- bility, be rendered legitimate ! But, in the rectitude and wisdom of our fellow-citizens, who preside with so much advantage over the interests of the state, we feel the fullest confidence ; recollecting the beautiful maxim of Ciceroâ€”" Justis autem etfidis hominibus (id est, bonis) ita fides habetur, ut nulla sit in his fraudis injuriaquc suspicio; itaque, his salutem nostram, his fortunas, his libc- ros, rectissime committi arbitramur.,y

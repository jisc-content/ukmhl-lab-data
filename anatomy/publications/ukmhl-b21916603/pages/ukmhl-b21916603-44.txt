42 citizens generally, who properly appreciate such an institution, should concur to ofYer every possible inducement to students to prefer their city and institutions to all others. Medical education, which, at present, commands a consi- derable share of public attention, involves in the manner of its administration, some of the dearest interests of society ; those therefore, who engage in discussions arising out of the exist- ing conditions of public institutions, ought carefully to inform themselves of the circumstances which are most favourable to the improvement of medicine, before they side with a party or declaim against individuals. In our happy country, every individual possessed of the re- quisite qualifications and character, has the right of teaching the results of his experience and study to whomsoever his in- structions may be acceptable. A body of such individuals, whether under the title of University or College, have no other claim upon the public than what they derive from the exertion of their talents and industry, and the benefits they are capable of conferring upon their fellow-citizens. The College may be under the patronage of a state, or it may be supported by the reputation of its teachers alone : it may derive the right to confer scientific honours from the state in which it is located, or from another source ; neither circumstance being of more than relative or nominal importance, since neither affect the excellence of the knowledge imparted, nor lessen the pecuni- ary benefits conferred by the institution upon the place in which it is established. Wherever the best- lectures are given and the greatest degree of talent and enterprise are displayed, there the largest number of pupils will be found. It is their own interests they seek to promote, when they select, and not those of the teachers they prefer ; hence every other consideration relative to the peculiarities of the institution, is with them subordinate to the character of the teachers, and the amount of useful knowledge to be acquired.

43 With these truths (confirmed by daily experience) in view, . it is amusing enough to hear the complaints and threatenings of those whose pecuniary interests are endangered by the fairest and most liberal competition, and who would willingly enlist the prejudices of society in their favour, so far as to bring in the strong arm of the law to shield them.

In aid of the same liberal policy, the complaint is often made by such persons, that they have no objection to a rival institution, but are offended that a foreign College should be established in their immediate vicinity ! Were this the fact,

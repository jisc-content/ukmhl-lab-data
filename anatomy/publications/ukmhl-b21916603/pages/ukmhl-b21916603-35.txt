To effect this desi- rable end, it is not necessary that the feelings of friends should he shocked; it is not necessary that any thing should be seen by them that could, without close examination, lead to a suspicion that the hand of the anatomist had been there. When once this is generally understood, and the importance of such examination fairly explained, the study of pathology will be extensively im- proved, and the practice of medicine incalcu- lably benefited. The obstacles which exist to oppose these researches, grow out of various prejudices, and in no small degree out of the supineness of physicians. We have already glanced at the general want of proper notions relative to our subject: a knowledge of anatomy being deficient, the individual grows contented

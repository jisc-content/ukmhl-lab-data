NOTE. It may not be amiss to add some facts which will enable those who take an interest in the scientific institutions of our country, to form an estimate of some of the benefits conferred by any distinguished school of medicine upon the city in which it is located. Each student expends, on an average, $400 during every session. This money is given for tickets of admission to the lectures, for books, boarding, clothing, &c. A class of 150 students, at $400 each, brings into circulation a gross amount of $50,000.* The class attending the course of lectures in a neighbouring city, is stated to be 500 in number. Allowing the same average, (which is far below the actual expenditure) that class expends during four months' attendance on the lec- tures, $200,000. The whole of the money thus expended, goes immediately into the hands of the citizens, from the ow- ners of property down to the humblest mechanics and servants, and the withdrawal of any considerable part of this supply, would be followed by much distress and inconvenience among all those who derive their support from ministering to the members of the class. But it is not merely by the gross amount expended during the session that the city is benefited by the attendants on a public course. They form acquaintances with men of busi- ness, with whom they continue to deal, in many instances, during their lives, and their influence is always favourably exerted towards the place in which they have completed their education, and have formed numerous interesting relations. It is not, therefore, surprising that the municipal authorities, and * This is about the amount expended this winter in New-York by the present class of Rutgers Medical College. F

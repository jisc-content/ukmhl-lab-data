DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 472 covered ceals the transversalis muscle, and the vessels and nerves ni/ob-1^ between the two. Near Poupart's ligament it lies on the spermatic cord and the fascia transversalis: the rectus muscle is concealed by the aponeurosis, and partly incased by it. Trans- The transversalis muscle forms the third stratum in the muscle, wall of the abdomen; like the former muscle, it is attached on all sides except where the spermatic cord lies, and takes origin from the pelvis, the chest, and the lumbar vertebras: Origin it has both an anterior and a posterior aponeurosis. At the chest, pelvis it arises from the outer third of Poupart's ligament, and ' and from the two anterior thirds of the crest of the ilium. At the chest it takes origin from the six lower ribs, viz. by tendon from the two lowest, and by fleshy processes from the under surface of the cartilages of the four next above. And it is connected with the lumbar vertebrae between the chest and the pelvis, by means of the posterior aponeurosis of the Fibres fascia lumborum. Most of the fibres are directed trans- aponeu- versely to the aponeurosis in front: but the lower arch Lowest downwards above the spot at which the cord leaves the dcwn to abdomen, and join the aponeurosis internal to that aperture, pubes. jjg aponeurosis is widest inferiorly, as in the most external aponeu- muscle.

PREFACE. In this edition of my "Demonstrations of Anatomy,3' I have endeavoured to make the work more complete by the correction of inaccuracies, and to render it more efficient, as a guide to dissection, by the introduction of such alterations as are suited to the increased attention that is now given to the study of Practical Anatomy. No alteration has been made in the original plan of the wTork, which consists of a system of dissections of the several parts of the body after the following method: â€”" In the examination of a part the attention of the student is directed first to its limits, to the superficial prominences of bone or muscle, and to the impressions that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. The different strata interposed between the surface and the bones are next examined in succession, with refer- ence particularly to the natural position of the several objects and their connections one with another, so that they may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in an operation of surgery. The anatomical description of the whole is likewise arranged in conformity with the mode of dissection, and each blood-vessel, nerve, or other structure, is described only to such an extent as it may be* laid bare in the region under examination." The instructions for conducting the progressive stages of a dissection having been carefully revised, are better adapted to aid the student in following the more difficult

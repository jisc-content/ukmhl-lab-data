CHAPTER XL DISSECTION OP THE EAR. The organ of hearing is made up of many complex parts, Defini- that are lodged in, or are attached to the surface of the tem- poral bone.

The external set (outer ear), which may be first ex- Outer amined, include the pinna or auricle, and the auditory canal: the former has been noticed at page 37., and the latter is de- scribed below. The auditory canal (meatus auditorius externus) is the Auditory canal. passage which leads from the pinna to a cavity in the tem- poral bone named the tympanum, and transmits inwards the sounds.

After the soft parts are removed, the 11' squamous part of the bone in front of the Glasserian fissure is to be sawn off; and the fore part of the meatus, except the portion below that gives support to the thin membrana tympani, is to be cut away with a bone forceps. This canal is about one inch and a quarter in length, and length; is formed partly by bone, and partly by cartilage and mem- brane. It is directed forwards somewhat obliquely, and IS direc- bent downwards rather beyond the middle, so that the floor slopes from that spot both outwards and inwards. In shape size and 3 d 3 shape-

436 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. the ver- bodies of the vertebrae are contained large veins, that join on the tebrse front 0f eacn vertebra with veins in that situation ; and unite to- gether, behind, into one trunk, that passes from the bone by the large aperture on the posterior surface. Escaped from the bone, the trunk divides into two branches that run, one to the right another to the left, to open into the large longitudinal veins. Posterior c. The posterior spinal veins form a plexus between the dura veins are mater and the laminae of the vertebrae. A large vein may be said tactÂ°with to lie on each side of the middle line, which joins freely with its lammse. fe|iow? an(j w^]j ^he anterior longitudinal vein by lateral branches. Into this plexus the small veins on the outside of the laminae pour their contents. Branches from these vessels are directed to the intervertebral foramina, where they end in the veins at the roots of the transverse processes.

183 CHAPTER II. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Section L MEMBRANES AND VESSELS. During the examination of the membranes, the vessels, and Position 7 7 of the the nerves, the brain is to be placed upside down, resting in brain, the coil of a cloth which supports it evenly. Membranes of the Brain. â€” The coverings of the brain Three > menin- (meninges) are three in number, viz. dura mater, pia mater, ges. and arachnoid membrane. The dura mater is a firm, fibrous investment that supports parts of the brain, and serves as an endosteum to the bones. The pia mater is the most internal layer, and is very vascular. And the arachnoid is a thin serous sac, which is situate between the other two. Besides enveloping the brain, these membranes are pro- longed on the cord into the spinal canal, and will be noticed in the dissection of that part. The description of the dura Dura A mater. mater will be found at p. 10. The arachnoid is a thin serous membrane, which lines Arach- the inner aspect of the dura mater *, and is reflected over mem. the pia mater and the brain. Around the vessels and nerves, that intervene between the skull and the brain, the mem- brane forms sheaths, which extend a short distance into the several apertures, and then become continuous with the parietal or cranial portion. Like other serous membranes, it forms a sac which contains a lubricating moisture; and it consists of a parietal and a visceral part. The parietal part is inseparably united to the inner sur- Parietal face of the dura mater, giving to it a smooth and polished Pan aspect, and is continued in the same manner over the pieces of that membrane that project between the different portions of the brain. * The existence of a distinct parietal part to this membrane is denied by Kblliker, Mikroskopische Anatomie, p. 489.

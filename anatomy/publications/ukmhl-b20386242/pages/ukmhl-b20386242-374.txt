This impression in the left auricle is above the fossa ovalis in the right cavity, because the aperture of communication between the two, in the fetus, was an oblique canal through the septum, open- The apertures in this auricle are those of the four pulmo- four pui- nary veins, two on each side, together with the opening of monary . . veins, communication with the left ventricle. The mouths of the two pulmonary veins are close to one another; those from the right lung open into the extreme right of the auricle near the septum, and those from the left lung enter the opposite part of the cavity, near the auricula. These veins are not one into provided with valves. The aperture into the ventricle will cienm" be afterwards seen to have a large and complicated valve, as on the right side, to guard it. current In the adult, the blood enters this cavity by the pulmonary in adult; veins, and passes to the left ventricle by the large inferior in fetus, opening between the two. In the fetus, however, the lungs are impervious to the air and the circulating fluid; and the left side of the heart receives its pure blood at once from the right auricle through the aperture (foramen ovale) in the septum.

A bursa is found between it and the bone. Near its attachment the tendon changes the direction of its surfaces; the anterior surface becoming external, and vice versa. The supinator brevis muscle partly surrounds the insertion. Section VI. THE BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. Position. — During the dissection of the back of the fore- arm, the limb lies with the fore part down, and a small block is to be placed beneath the wrist for the purpose of stretching the tendons. Take Dissection. — The fascia with the cutaneous nerves and superfi-6 vessels are to be reflected from the muscles of the fore-arm, seis and and from the tendons on the back of the hand ; but a thick- fascia, ened band of it (posterior annular ligament), opposite the carpus, is to be left. If the integument has not been taken from the fingers, let the dissector proceed to remove it, in order that the tendons may be traced to the ends of the fingers. The several muscles should be separated from one another up to their origin, especially the radial extensors of the wrist. Annular The posterior annular ligament consists of the special ligament x , . , L behind aponeurosis of the limb, thickened by the addition of some wrist, transverse fibres, and is situate opposite the lower ends of the bones of the fore-arm. This ligamentous band is con- nected at the outer part to the radius, and at the inner to the cuneiform and pisiform bones. It confines the extensor

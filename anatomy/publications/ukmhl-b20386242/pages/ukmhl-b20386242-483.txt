465 DORSAL VESSELS OF THE PENIS. into two pieces, which are fixed to the upper surface of the body of the penis, and are prolonged on it for some distance. In the interval between the layers are the dorsal vessels and Con- tains nerves of the penis. Indels Dorsal vessels and nerves. — The arteries and nerves on nerves, the dorsum of the penis, are the terminal parts of the pudic veS°f trunks of each side. The vein corresponding to the arteries nerves, enters the front of the pelvis through the triangular perineal ligament. The dorsal artery, one on each side, appears between the layers Dorsal of the suspensory ligament, and extends forwards to the glans, penis, where it ends in many branches for that structure : in this course £fbp^ch the artery supplies the integuments and body of the penis. It may Peculia_ be derived from the accessory pudic (p. 453.). rities- The dorsal vein is a single trunk, and commences by numerous Dorsal branches from the prepuce and the glans penis. The course of the ends in vein is backwards by the side of the artery, between the layers of pfexIS?0 the suspensory ligament, and then through the triangular ligament of the urethra, to join the prostatic plexus of veins. In its extent along the penis the vein receives branches from the erectile struc- tures of that body. Each dorsal nerve takes the same course as the artery to the Dorsal glans penis, and ends like it in numerous branches to that part, pudic. It furnishes a large branch to the corpus cavernosum penis, and other offsets to the integuments of the dorsum, the sides, and the prepuce of the penis. In the female these vessels are much smaller than in the Vessels male, and they occupy the upper surface of the clitoris. tons. Dissection. — The surface of the external muscle of the To ex- abdominal wall is next to be freed from fascia on both sides exter- of the body. It is not advisable to begin cleaning this lique " muscle in front, because there it has only a thin aponeurosis, and is readily removed with the fat. Behind, however, the muscle is thick and fleshy, and cannot well be injured; whilst beginning the dissection at the posterior part, the student is to carry the knife obliquely upwards and down- wards in the direction of the fibres. The thin aponeu- rosis before referred to is in front of a line extended upwards from the anterior part of the crest of the ilium; and as the dissector approaches this spot, he must be more careful not to injure it, especially at the upper part, where it lies on the margin of the ribs.

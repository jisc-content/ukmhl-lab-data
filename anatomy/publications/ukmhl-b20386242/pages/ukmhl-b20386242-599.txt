581 FASCIA OF THE PELVIS. CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is but a part of the general abdo- pefim- minal space (p. 493.), and is situate below the brim or inlet and situ- of the true pelvis. Boundaries. — The space is surrounded by the firm bony Bound- ring of the pelvic bones, and therefore admits of little alter- ation in its form or capacity. Behind it is bounded by the sacrum and the coccyx, and, laterally and in front, by the in- nominate bones covered by the obturator muscles. Inferiorly, or towards the perinseum, the cavity is limited by the fascia reflected from the wall to the viscera, and by the levatores ani and coccygei muscles : it is only in this last direction, where the bounding structures are moveable, that alterations ■tan be made in the capacity of the space. Contents, — In the interior are contained the* urinary Con- tents. bladder, the lower end of the large intestine, or the rectum, and some of the generative organs according to the sex. All these parts have vessels, nerves, and lymphatics dis- tributed to them, and the serous membrane is reflected over them. Section I. FASCIA OF "THE PELVIS AND MUSCLES OF THE OUTLET. On the wall of the pelvis is a thin fascia (pelvic), which ex- outline tends from the brim to the outlet, and covers the obturator fascia of muscle. At a certain level a visceral portion is directed in- vis6.pel" wards from it to the rectum and the bladder, and this is named recto-vesical fascia from the viscera with which it is connected. Dissection. — To bring into view the parietal part, or the steps to pelvic fascia, the external iliac vessels, and the psoas if this has the pel- not been removed in the dissection of the lumbar plexus, are da. as" to be taken away on the left side of the body. The obturator vessels and nerve are to be cut away on the same side; p p 3

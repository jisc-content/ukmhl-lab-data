218 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. anterior half from the septum lucidum, so that it can be raised forwards. Fifth The ventricle of the septum (fifth ventricle) exists in the tncie. anterior part of the ventricular partition, where the depth is greatest. Like the septum that contains it, its largest part is in front. In the adult it is distinct from the other ven- tricles, but in the fetus it opens inferiorly into the third, between the pillars of the fornix. Its surface has an epi- thelial covering, like that in the lateral ventricles. Dissec. Dissection. — The fornix should be next examined. To lay bare that body the posterior part of the corpus callosum should be detached with care from it, and thrown back- wards ; and the septum lucidum should also be removed from its upper surface. Fornix; The fornix, or arch, is a thin white horizontal stratum and beneath the corpus callosum, which, projecting on each side into the lateral ventricle, forms part of the floor of that cavity. It is triangular in shape, with the base turned backwards, and is connected with the rest of the brain only by its apex and base, where it gives off processes or crura, both before and behind. Poste- At its posterior part or base, the fornix has the following noran arrangement: — At the middle line it joins the corpus cal- losum, whilst on each side it sends off a small riband-like band — taenia hippocampi — along the concave margin of anterior the hippocampus major. At the anterior part, or apex, it is pdrt* arched over the foramen of Monro, opposite the front of the optic thalamus, and ends likewise in two processes or crura, which will be afterwards followed to the corpora albicantia Upper and the optic thalami (p. 225.). To the upper surface, along andfbCor- the middle line, the septum lucidum is attached. Each bor- ders' der is free in the corresponding lateral ventricle, where it rests on the optic thalamus, and along it lies the choroid plexus. Under If the fornix be cut across near its front, the foramen of surface Monro will be opened, and the descending anterior pillars will be seen. When the posterior part is raised, the fornix will be found to be supported on a process of the pia mater, named velum interpositum ; and at its base (on the under aspect) between the two offsets, or the taeniae hippocampi, a marked triangular surface will be seen, which is marked by trans-

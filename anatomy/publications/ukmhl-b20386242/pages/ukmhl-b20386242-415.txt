LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAE. 397 arches of the vertebrae, and close the spinal canal behind, are two /» . to each In the interval between the arches ot two continuous verte- space, brae, are two somewhat square ligaments, one for each half of the arch, which approach one another along the middle line. Each consists of elastic yellow tissue, and is attached Attach- above to the inner surface of the arch, but below to the upper border, and somewhat to the outer surface of the correspond- ing part of the arch next below. On each side the ligament reaches from the articular process to the root of the spinous process. Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are special fibrous ligaments in the corresponding situation (see p. 179.). c. Ligaments of the spines.—Along the tips of the spinous Those processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is a longitudinal spines band of fibres, or the supraspinous ligament. It is thicker j^onst. in the lumbar than in the dorsal region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres; the former reaching over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons of the muscles. The ligamentum nuchae takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin and somewhat and be- tween membranous interspinous ligaments, which reach from the the . spines. root to the tip of the spinous process. The strength of these bands is dependant upon the interval they have to fill; therefore they are more marked in the lumbar than in the other vertebrae, and they are least strong in the cervical region. d. Ligaments of the transverse processes.—In the loins Those the intertransverse ligaments are thin membranous bands in trans- the intervals between the processes. In the dorsal vertebrae pro- cesses. they are round bundles of fibres. And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there.

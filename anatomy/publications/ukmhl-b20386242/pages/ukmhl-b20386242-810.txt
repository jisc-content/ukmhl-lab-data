DISSECTION OF THE EAR. 792 Meeting with the lining of nucleated cells, the tubules lose vh?te tne wn*te substance of Schwann, and probably end in a sub- ti fibrous film," like that of the inner stratum of the nervous itance, 7 layer of the retina (Todd and Bowman). The same authors state that some of the tubules surrounded by the otolith in fibred aPPear to terminate in free points, as in the frog, without nside. iosing their white substance. Irched amPu^ary enlargement of the tubes of the semi- ubes circular canals the nerve enters the concave side, where it .hey ?orm a forms a forked eminence (Steifensand), corresponding to the tion, and projection in the interior. The nerve tubules do not spread loops out as in the &acs, but are confined to the swelling, in which therein. ° they end in a series of loops (Wagner). In the cod-fish the nerves are said to terminate in free extremities as well as in loops. — (Todd and Bowman.)

751 ARTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. Articulation of the metatarsus with the pha- Union . . °f nieta- langes. — These are ball and socket joints, in which the t^lrdsusha head of the metatarsal bone is received into the cup-shaped langes, cavity of the phalanx. Each articulation has two lateral and an inferior ligament, t as in the hand, and the joint is further strengthened above andin- 7 ° 0 fenor by an expansion derived from the tendon of the short exten- Hg&- J 1 m ments. sor of the toes. A distinct synovial membrane exists in each. In the articulation of the great toe there are two synovial sesamoid bones, which are connected with the inferior and lateral ligaments. All these structures are better seen in the hand, where See the hand. they are more distinct; and their anatomy is more fully described in the dissection of that part. See page 332. Articulations of the phalanges. — There are two ,Vnion of the pna- phalangeal joints to each toe, except to the first. The same ^meL ligaments are found in these as in the metatarsophalangeal ^crib- joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior. The joint between j^jjfthe the two last phalanges is least distinct, and oftentimes the small bones are connected together by osseous material. These ligaments receive a more particular notice in the dissection of the hand (p. 333.).

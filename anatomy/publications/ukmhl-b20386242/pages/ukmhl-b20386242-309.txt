291 u 2 CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE FORE-ARM. aspect, where they form an arch, and are continued along the fore-arm to end in the basilic and cephalic veins of the arm. Superficial arch. — This arch on the back of the hand is more or Arch on less perfect, and receives the posterior or superficial digital veins, hand. At the sides the arch terminates in the radial and ulnar veins of the fore-arm. The radial vein begins in the outer part of the arch before men- radial; tioned, and in some small radicles from the back of the thumb. It is then continued along the fore-arm, at first behind, and then on the outer border, as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein by its union with the outer branch of the median vein. The ulnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the front ulnar; and the back of the fore-arm. The anterior arises near the wrist, anterior' by the junction of small roots from the hand and fore-arm, and runs on the inner part of the fore-arm to the elbow ; here it unites with the inner branch of the median, and forms the basilic vein. The posterior ulnar vein is situate on the back of the limb. It an<? Pos- . tenor; commences, at the hand, by the union of a large branch, " vena salvatella," from the back of the little finger, with the offset of the venous arch ; it is then continued along the back of the fore-arm, nearly to the elbow, and bends forwards to open into the anterior ulnar vein. The median vein commences on the front of the arm, near the median, wrist, by small branches which are derived from the palmar surface of the hand, and is directed along the centre of the fore- arm nearly to the elbow. Here the vein divides into external and internal branches (median basilic and median cephalic), which unite, as before seen (p. 274.) with the radial and ulnar veins. At its point of bifurcation the median receives a communicating branch from a vein accompanying the artery beneath the fascia. Cutaneous Nerves. — In the fore-arm the superficial super- • ficial nerves are continued from those of the arm, viz. on the nerves of n -i fore-arm inner part, from the large internal cutaneous nerve; and on the outer part, from the two external cutaneous nerves de- rived from the musculo-spiral and the musculo-cutaneous. Occasionally there is a small offset of the ulnar nerve in the fore-arm. On the back of the hand is the termination of the and back of hand radial nerve, together with a branch of the ulnar nerve. are The internal cutaneous nerve was seen in a previous dissection internal (p. 276.) to be divided into two parts. The anterior branch neous; extends on the front of the fore-arm as far as the wrist, and sup- plies the integument on the inner half of the anterior surface,

The lining of the other ventricles is prolonged into this by the aperture of communication with the third. choroid In this ventricle is a vascular fold, or a choroid plexus, on theXca-°f each side, similar to the body of the same name in the other Vlty' ventricles. It is attached to the inner surface of the mem- brane (pia mater), that closes the ventricle between the medulla and the cerebellum, and it extends upwards on the side. Its vessels are supplied by the inferior cerebellar artery.

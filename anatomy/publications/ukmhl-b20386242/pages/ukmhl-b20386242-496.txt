Thus, in proceeding from within outwards, the student will find the following layers around the consti- tuents of the cord: — first the sub-peritoneal fat, then the tube of the fascia transversalis, next the cremaster muscle— continuous with the internal oblique, afterwards the inter- columnar fascia from the external oblique muscle, and lastly the superficial fascia and the skin, in fe- The round ligament, or the suspensory cord of the uterus, round u- occupies the inguinal canal in the female, and ends in the pment jn^egumen^g 0f the groin.

It enters tery, the cord through the internal abdominal ring, and descends to the testis, in which it ends : it distributes branches to the vas deferens and the epididymis. In the female, a branch from the ovarian artery (spermatic ?) enters the round liga- veins, ment. The spermatic veins leave the posterior part of the testicle, and receive branches from the epididymis: ascend- ing in the cord, in front of the vas deferens, they divide and anastomose, and form the spermatic plexus. Artery The cremasteric covering of the cord has a separate artery nerve of and nerve. The artery is derived from the cremasteric veringp branch of the epigastric (p. 481.), and is distributed to the cord.6 coverings of the cord. The genital branch of the genito- crural nerve enters the cord by the internal abdominal ring, and ends in the cremaster muscle. Other filaments to the coverings of the cord come from the ilio-inguinal nerve. Nerves.

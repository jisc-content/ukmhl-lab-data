640 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Superb The superior ligamentous bands are placed as their name or band. expresses. sub- The sub-pubic ligament (ligam. arcuatum) is a strong jjg^i triangularly-shaped band below the symphysis, and occupies the upper part of the pubic arch. Its fibres curve down- wards, and are attached on each side to the upper part of the ramus of the pubes. The apex of the ligament touches the articular cartilage, and the base is turned towards the mem- branous part of the urethra and the muscle around it. Carti- Cartilage. â€” This structure will be best seen by opening how' the articulation behind : a transverse section will also show ' the disposition of the anterior ligament of the articulation, disposi- The surface of each innominate bone entering into the the sym- pubic symphysis is covered with a stratum of cartilage. In physic, consequence 0f the shape of the bones, the opposite carti- lages touch one another behind, but are separated in front by an interval, where they give attachment to the deep transverse fibres of the anterior ligament. At the centre and the upper part of the articulation, the pieces of cartilage are generally blended in the middle line, but the extent of this union is very variable, hoijow Towards the posterior part of the cartilaginous mass is a hollow* with uneven walls, and a synovial looking fluid. Here the structure is distinctly fibrous, with large inter- spersed compound cells. * This hollow varies much in size, and in the smoothness of its walls. It is said to increase in pregnancy. In two female bodies in which I examined it, the one being at the middle of pregnancy, the other not pregnant, the space occupied all the articulation except the part in front, where the fibrous bands of the anterior ligament are situate.

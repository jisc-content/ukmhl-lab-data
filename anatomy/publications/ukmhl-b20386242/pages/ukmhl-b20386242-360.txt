DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 342 between, as low as the fourth costal cartilage; but below that spot it presents a V shaped notch, whose apex is oppo- site the outer part of the cartilage of the fifth rib, and whose base is turned to the middle line. Two fissures are seen in Poste- this border of the right lung, but only one in that of the is thick! left lung. The posterior border is as long again as the anterior, and projects inferiorly between the lower ribs and the diaphragm; it is thick and vertical, and is received into the hollow by the side of the spinal column. External On the outer aspect the lung is convex, and is in contact with the wall of the thorax. A large cleft divides this sur- face into two pieces (lobes of the lung), and on the right internal side there is a second smaller fissure. The inner surface is surface flat when compared with the outer, and is marked by the following inequalities: — Altogether in front, is the hollow corresponding to the heart and its large vessels, which is gives at- greatest on the left lung; behind this, but nearer the pos- mentto terior than the anterior border, is a fissure about three the root. inches long (hilum pulmonis), which receives the vessels forming the root of the lung. Division Each lung is divided incompletely into two parts or lobes lobes, by an oblique fissure, that begins near the apex, and ends in Left has the anterior border near the base.

The increased length and the narrowness of the left lung are due to the absence below of a large projecting body like the liver, and to the direction of the heart to the left more than to the right side. Root of Boot of the lung. — The vessels of the lung entering the fissure on the inner surface are bound together by the pleura and some cellular membrane; they form a foot-stalk or the root, which fixes the lung to the heart and the windpipe.

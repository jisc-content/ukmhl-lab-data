645 T T 3 CHAPTER IX. DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. Section I. THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. All the parts described in Section I. are to be examined Direc- before the time for turning the body has arrived. Position. — During the dissection of the front of the thigh Position the body should lie on the back, with a block of a suitable body, size beneath the pelvis, and the lower limbs should hang over the end of the dissecting table. The limb is to be rotated outwards, so as to make evident a hollow at the upper part of the thigh; and is to be supported in a half bent position by means of a stool beneath the foot. Surface marking. — Before any of the integument is re- objects moved from the limb, the student is to observe the chief surface, markings and eminences on the surface of the thigh. The limit between the thigh and the abdomen is marked Promi- nences in front by the firm band of Poupart's ligament inter- limiting i , 1 thethigr venmg between the crest of the ilium and the pubes. above. On the outer side the division is indicated by the convexity of the crest of the innominate bone, which subsides behind in the sacrum and coccyx; and on the inner side, by the projection of the os pubis, from which a line of bone (rami of the pubes and ischium) may be traced backwards along the inner and upper part of the limb to the tuberosity of the ischium. On the anterior aspect of the thigh, and close to Poupart's Hoiiow- ligament, is a slight hollow, corresponding to the triangular pI'sCdr~ space of Scarpa, in which the large vessels of the limb are space* contained; and extending thence obliquely along the inner side of the limb, is a slight depression marking the situation

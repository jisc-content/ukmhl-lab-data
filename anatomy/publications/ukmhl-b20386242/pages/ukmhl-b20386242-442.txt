424 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL COED. the sheath is much greater than is necessary for the contents; and the size of the sheath is also larger in the neck and the and is loins than in the back. On the outer aspect the dura mater connect- IS smooth, when a comparison is made between it and that bones in the skull, for it does not act as a periosteum to the bones. Between it and the osseous surfaces are some vessels and fat; and it is connected to the posterior common ligament of the it gives vertebras by a few fibrous bands. On each side the dura sphTai °n mater sends offsets along the spinal nerves issuing by the nerves jntervertebral foramina ; inferiorly these several offsets be- come gradually longer, forming small tubes which enclose the sacral nerves, and lie for some distance within the spinal and one canal. In the midst of these tubes, into which the dura inferior mater seems to be divided below, will be seen the slender piece' before-mentioned impervious cord, that descends from the lower part of the tube of the dura mater to the end of the spinal canal, and is blended with the periosteum covering the back of the coccyx. Dissec- Dissection.—The sheath of the dura mater with the con- remote tained cord is next to be removed from the'body. For this tord purpose the lateral processes in the intervertebral apertures are to be cut, and the central prolongation is to be detached from the coccyx. Next, the cord and its membranes are to be divided opposite the lower cervical vertebras, and to be removed by cutting the bands that attach the dura mater to the ligament of the vertebras, and see When the cord is taken out, it is to be placed on a piece of board, or on a table, with the lateral offsets widely sepa- rated. To show the arachnoid covering, the dura mater is to be slit along the middle, on both aspects, as far as the small median cord before referred to ; but it is to be raised whilst it is being cut through, so that the loose arachnoid, that envelops the cord, may not be injured. Lastly, the dura -mater is to be fastened back with pins. Ar;>ch- * The arachnoid membrane is the thin serous covering of mem- the cord which is immediately beneath the dura mater. Like has"a tne corresponding membrane in the skull, it invests the nervous centre and lines the dura mater, and consists thus of a visceral and a parietal part* ; but the visceral piece, next CO' vering. * .This reflection of the membrane over the dura mater is denied by

DEMONSTRATIONS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. The superficial parts of the head should be first examined, Direc- . tions re- so as to allow the speedy removal of the brain. On the specting r J the dis- left side of the head the muscles are to be seen, and on the section, opposite side the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. For the subsequent guidance of the student it may be Con- cerning here stated, at the outset, how much of the dissection has to time, be finished whilst the body lies on the back. The parts described in the first sixty pages are to be learnt before the position is altered to allow of the dissection of the back ; but should want of time necessitate an omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 39.) can be best deferred till a subsequent stage. Certainly the orbit, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck, should be dissected before the first position of the body is changed.

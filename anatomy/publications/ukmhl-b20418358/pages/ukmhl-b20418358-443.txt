Afterwards the nerve is to be followed forwards to where it enters beneath the superficial fascia nearer the middle line. The swperjicial fascia of the anterior half of the perineum is com- Superficial posed of two layers, which differ in their characters and relations. ' One is the subcutaneous fatty part, continuous witli tliat of the subcutanc- adjoining regions : its thickness, and the quantity of fat in it vary ^^^^ P''*''* \ with the condition of the body. Passing in front into the scrotum, it there loses its fat, and contains involuntary muscular fibres, forming the layer known as the clarfos. The other (fascia of Colles) is a more membranous stratum of and mem- limitecl extent, and is connected with the firm subjacent structures, ifvor""" Externally it is fixed to the conjoined rami of the ischium and pubis, outside the line of the crus penis and its muscle, extending as far back as the ischial tuberosity.

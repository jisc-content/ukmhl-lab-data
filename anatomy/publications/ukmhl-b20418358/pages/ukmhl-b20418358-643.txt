ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. 629 (fig, 199/). It supplies two otFsets while it is beneath the fascia in the thigh. A communicating branch arises about the middle of the thigh, which has a and crosses inwards beneath the sartorius to join in the plexus of cating^"^" the internal cutaneous and obturator nerves, or with the internal cutaneous nearer the knee : this branch is often absent. The patellar branch springs from the nerve near the knee-joint, ^ P^', and perforating the sartorius muscle and the fascia lata, ends in the integument over the knee (p. 610). A branch of nerve to the tensor vagime femoris is derived from Nerve of tlie superior gluteal (p. 643) ; it enters the deep surface of the va"inai. muscle, and may be followed nearly to the lower end. Directions. After the examination of the muscles of the front of J^^^j^^j^^^^ the thigh, with their vessels and nerves, the student is to learn the tors, adductor muscles, and the vessels and nerves which belong to them. PARTS ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. The muscles in this position are the three adductors,—longus, The adduc- brevis, and magnus, with the gracilis and pectineus. These have ''"^^"^ the following position with respect to one another :—Internal to all, ^^"g\^^ jj"^ and the longest, is the gracilis. Suj^erficial to the others are the ^^""^ pectineus and the adductor longus; and beneath the last two are the short adductor and the adductor magnus. In connection with the muscles, and supplying them, are the pro- vcs.seis and funda artery (of the femoral) with the accompanying vein, and the "'^i'^'*^' obturator nerve. Dissection. For the preparation of the muscles, the investing Dissection fascia and tissue are to be taken awav ; and the two superficial of adductor adductors are to be separated from one another. Let the student be careful of the branches of the obturator nerve Nerves, in connection ,with the muscles, viz., those entering the fleshy fibres, and one issuing beneath tlie adductor longus, to join the plexus at the inner side of the thigh. Lastly, should any fat and veins be left with the profunda and Remove its branches, they must be removed. a cms. The GRACILIS reaches from the pelvis to the tibia (fig. 204, c), ^'"aeilis and is fleshy and riband-like above, but tendinous below. The takes ongiu . <^ . . ' trom the muscle arises by a thin aponeurosis, two or three inches in depth, pelvis: from the pubic border of the hip-bone close to the margin, viz., opposite the lower half of the symphysis, and the upper part of the pubic arch. Inferiorly it is inserted by a flat tendon, about one-third is inserted of an inch wide, into the inner surface of the tibia, beneath and close ' ' to the sartorius. The muscle is superficial throughout. For two-thirds of the thigh ^^^^JJ^^J it is flattened against the adductors brevis and magnus, so as to muscles; have its borders directed forwards and backwards ; and in the lower third, it intervenes between the sartorius and semimembranosus muscles, and helps to form the inner boundary of the popliteal

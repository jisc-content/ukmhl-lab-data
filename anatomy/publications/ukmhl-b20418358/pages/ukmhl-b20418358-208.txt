194 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Median Tlie medulla oblongata is divided into halves by a median fissure anteS front and behind, in a line with those of the cord. The anterior median fissure is interruj^ted at the lower end of the bulb by some bundles of fibres which cross obliquely from one side to the other, and constitute the decussation of the pyramids; above, it ends at the lower border of the pons in a dila- tation (foramen caecum). The pos- terior median fissure is continued upwards from the cord through the lower half of the medulla oblongata, and then terminates by the separa- tion of its lateral boundaries to form the sides of the fourth ventricle. On each half of the medulla oblongata are elongated eminences, separated by slight grooves, and continuous with the columns of the spinal cord; but they receive different names in this part of their extent, and some fresh bodies are added. Thus, the part continuing the anterior column of the cord, by the side of the anterior median fissure, is known as the pyramid (fig. 57,^). The prolongation of tlie lateral column takes the name of lateral tract ("), the position of Avhich is occupied in the upper half of the bulb by an oval eminence called the olivary body. Continuing the posterior column is the f uniculus cuneatus (fig. 58, fc), which is separated from the lateral tract by a smaller eminence to which the name of funiculus of Rolando {R) has been given : in the upper jDart of the medulla these are succeeded by the restiform body (fig. 57,^; fig. 58, rb) projecting outwards towards the cerebellum. And lastly, between the funiculus cuneatus and the posterior median fissure is the f uniculus gracilis (fig. 58,continued from the j^osterior median column of the cord. Pyramid. The pyramid (anterior) is placed between the anterior median fissure on the inner side and the lateral tract with the olivary body on the outer side. It increases in size from below upwards, whence its name; but at the upper end it is somewhat constricted and rounded just before it disappears beneath the superficial trans- verse fibres of the -pons. This body is only in small part pro- longed from the anterior column of the cord, its inner and larger portion being formed by the decussating fibres seen in the anterior median fissure.

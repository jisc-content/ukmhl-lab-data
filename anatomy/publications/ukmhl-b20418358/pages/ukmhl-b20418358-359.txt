345 POSITION OF HEART. heart projects about one inch and a half from the middle Hne of the sternum ; and on the left, the apex is distant from three to three and left, and a half inches from the centre of the breast-bone. The portion of the heart which is uncovered by lung (the area of Superficial superficial cardiac dulness) is included between the middle line of ^eSt^ the sternum, in its lower third, and a line drawn from the centre Fig. 113. of the breast-bone between the fourth costal cartilages to the apex of the heart (%. 113). Component parts. The heart is a double organ ; and in each half Chambers of there are two chambers, an auricle and a ventricle, which com- municate together, and are provided with vessels for the entrance and exit of the blood. The surface is marked by grooves indicating Grooves: this division. Thus, passing circularly round the heart, nearer the auricuio- base than the apex, is a groove which cuts off the thin auricular ventncuiai', from the fleshy ventricular part ; and on each surface there is a and inter- longitudinal sulcus over the partition between the ventricles. The ventricular, interventricular groove is nearer the left border of the heart in front, and the right border behind. The auricles are two, right and left, and their wall is much Auricles: thinner than that of the ventricles. They are placed deeply at the position, base of the heart ; and each is prolonged forwards into a small * Diagram shewing the position of the heart to the ribs and sternum, the soft parts being removed from the exterior of the thorax. The edge of each luns is shown by a dotted Hne. The left auricle extends somewhat higher than the area indicated in the figure, projecting into the second intercostal space.

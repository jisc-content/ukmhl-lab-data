TRANSVERSALIS MUSCLE. 453 of the lumbar plexus (ilio-liypogastric and ilio-ingniiial) near tlie fore part of the ilium. Tlie offsets entering the muscle must be <;ut. Farts covered by the internal oblique (fig. 151). The internal Parts oblique conceals the transversalis muscle, and the vessels and nerves hiternai'^^ Ijetween the two. Near Poupart's ligament it lies on the spermatic oblique. <:ord and the transversalis fascia. The rectus muscle is covered below by the aponeurosis. The TRANSVERSALIS MUSCLE (fig. 151, a) fomiS the third stratum Transveisa- in the wall of the abdomen, and differs from the two oblique mus- ^'^ '"^^^^^^ • rles in having a posterior as well as an anterior aponeurosis. Like the internal oblique it is attached on all sides, except where the s])ermatic cord lies. At the pelvis it arises from the outer third of ">iigm tvotu Poupart's ligament, and the anterior two-thirds of the iliac crest and pelvis; along the inner border; at the chest it takes origin by fleshy slips from the inner surface of the lower six costal cartilages ; and between the chest and the pelvis it is connected with the lumbar tibres end iu \'ertebra3 by means of the posterior aponeurosis or the fascia lum- '^i'^^^^^^^^^''- borum. All the fibres are directed to the aponeurosis in front. Its anterior aponeurosis is widest in the centre, and narroAvest at Jiu; aponcu- the upper end. Internally it is continued to the linea alba, passing jjehind^^^^ ^ beneath the rectus as low as midway between the umbilicus and the ^^^^^^^^ pubis, but in front of the muscle below that spot. Its attachment i,nver pait. below to the pelvis is nearly the same as the internal oblique ; for it is fixed to the Iront of the pubis, and to the pectineal line for about an inch. Some of the fibres end on the transversalis fascia. Fibres to and are connected beneatli Poupart's ligament with a thickened band of that fascia which is called the deep crural aich. Action. The transversalis muscle draws do^mwards the lower ribs. Use. and diminishes the abdominal cavity, compressing the viscera and forcing upwards the diaphragm. Conjoined temlon. The aponeuroses of the internal oblicpie and At pelvis transversalis muscles are united near their attachment to the j^ubis, t?,"ijoi„ed and give rise to the conjoined tendon. The aponeurosis of the tendon, oblique muscle extends about half an inch along the pectineal line ; while that of the transversalis reaches an inch along the bony ridge, and forms the greater part of the conjoined tendon. The posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis, or the fascia lum- rosterior borum (c), is described in the dissection of the back, p. 392. aponeurosis. Relations. Superficial to the transversalis are the two muscles Relations of before examined ; and beneath it is the thin transversalis fascia. ^'''^^^^ Its fleshy attachments to the ribs alternate with like processes of the diaphragm ; and the highest slip joins the lower edge of the triangularis sterni muscle. The lower border of the transversalis is fleshy in the outer, but tendinous in the inner half, and is arched above the internal abdominal ring. Dissection. To remove the aponeurotic layer from the rectus ]:.\]jose muscle of the right side, make a longitudinal incision through the J™?,iauiis. tendinous sheath, and turn it to each side. As the fascia is reflected, its union with three or more tendinous bands across the rectus will

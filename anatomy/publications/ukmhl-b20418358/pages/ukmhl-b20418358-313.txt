299 ANTEEIOH INTEROSSEOUS ARTERY. secondly, the last phalangeal joiiU ; and thirdly, the metacarpo- phalangeal. The FLEXOR LONGUB poLLicis (hg. 96, b) arises from the anterior Longflexoi- siirface of the radius, as low as the pronator quadratus, and from the outer part of the interosseous membrane ; it is also joined in ' most cases by a distinct slip arising in common with the tiexor sublimis digitorimi either from the internal condyle of the limnerus or the coronoid process of the ulna. The fleshy fibres des^cend to a tendon, which is continued beneath the annuUir ligament, and is inserted into the last phalanx of the thumlj. insertion; The greater part of the muscle is covered by the tiexor sublimis parts above digitorum ; and the radial vessels rest on it for a short distance below. It lies on the radius and the pronator quadratus. To the ^^^} ^^^neath inner side is the flexor profundus digitorum. Action. This muscle is the special flexor of the last joint of the thumb, but it also aids in bending the other joints of that digit and tlie wrist. The PRONATOR QUADRATUS (fig. 9G, d) is a flat muscle covering Pronator the lower fourth of the bones of the forearm. It arises from the anterior surface of the ulna, where it is somewhat widened, and is inserted into the fore and inner parts of the radius for about two inches. The anterior surface is covered l)y the tendons of the flexor ^^^^^^^P^^"} muscles of the digits, and by the radial vessels ; and the posterior surface rests on the radius and ulna with the intervening membrane, and on the interosseous vessels and ner\ e. Along its lower border is the arch formed l)y the anterior carpal arteries. Action. The end of the radius is moved inwards over the ulna by use. this muscle, and the hand is pronated. The ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS ARTERY (fig. 96, e) is continued on Anterior in- . 11 XI terosseous the front of the interosseous membrane between the two flexors or artery, in the fibres of the flexor profundus digitorum, till it reaches an aperture in the membrane beneath the pronator (j[uadratus. At that spot the artery turns from the front to the back of the limb, and descends to the back of the carpus, where it ends by anastomosing with the posterior interosseous and carpal arteries. Branches. Numerous offsets are given to the deep muscles. Branches: One long branch, 'median (/), accompanies the median nerve, niusculai median, which it sui^plies, and either ends in the flexor suldimis, or is con tinned beneath the annular ligament to the palmar arch. Above the middle of the forearm the medvllartj arteries of the J^^t^^^^Jl^^oJ^g^ radius and ulna arise from the vessel. Where it is about to pass through the hiterosseous membrane and carpal, it furnishes twigs to the pronator quadratus ; and one branch is continued beneath that muscle to anastomose with the anterior carpal arteries. The ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS NERVE (fig. 96, ') is derived from the Anterior ,> Â° 4. +1, interosseous median, and accompanies the artery of the same name to tJie pro- nerve ends nator quadratiis muscle, the under surface of which it enters. pronator. Branches are given by it to the deep flexor muscles.

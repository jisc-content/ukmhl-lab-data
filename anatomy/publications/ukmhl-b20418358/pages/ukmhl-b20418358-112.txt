It lies on the hyo-glossus muscle immediately alcove the deep part of the Fig. 25.* has roots froui the fifth, facial and sympa- thetic ; gives hrauches to gland. Chorda tyjnpani suljmaxillaiy gland, and is attached by two or three filaments to the lingual nerve. Connection icith vrrvesâ€”roots. The fibres of the sensory root are derived from the lingual, and of the motor root from the chorda tymjjani nerves, both joining the upper part of the ganglion. Tlie sympathetic root conies from the plexus on the facial artery. Branches. From the lower part of the ganglion five or six small ofi'sets descend to the submaxillary gland ; and from the fore part other filaments are given to the mucous membrane of the mouth jmd Wharton's duct. Chorda tymPx^ni. Joining the lingual nerve close below its origin (p. 93), the chorda tympani accompanies that trunk, but can be easily separated from it nearly as far as the tongue.

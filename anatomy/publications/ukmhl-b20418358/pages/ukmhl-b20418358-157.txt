143 BEANCHES OF MECKEL'S GANGLIOK sembles the other ganglia in connection with the fifth nerve in having sensory, motor, and sympathetic offsets or roots connected with it. The branches of the ganglion are distributed chiefly to the nose branches, and palate, but small offsets are given to the pharynx and the orbit. Other offsets or roots connect it with surrounding nerves. Branches to the nose. The nasal branches, from three to five in Nasal number, are very small and soft, and pass inwards through the spheno-palatine foramen; they are distributed in the nose and the roof of the mouth. Tlie superior nasal branches ramify in the mucous membrane on superior uasal, Fig. 37.^^ the two upper spongy bones, and a few filaments reach the back part of the septum nasi. The naso-palatine nerve (fig. 36, ^) crosses the roof of the nasal naso- fossa to reach the septum, on which it descends to near the front of that partition. In the floor of the nose it enters a special canal by the side of the septum, the left being anterior to the right, and is conveyed to the roof of the mouth, where it lies in the centre of the anterior palatine fossa. Finally, the nerves of opposite sides are distributed in the mucous membrane behind the incisor teeth, and communicate with one another. On the septum nasi filaments are supplied by the naso-palatine nerve to the mucous membrane. To follow the nerve to its termination, the canal in the roof of the mouth must be opened. * Nerves of tlie outer wall of the nose and of the palate. 1. Olfactory tract. 2.

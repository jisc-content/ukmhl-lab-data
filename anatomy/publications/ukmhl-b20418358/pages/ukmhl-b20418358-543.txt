529 THE DIAPHEAGM. cardiiim (p. 377). At the circumference of the midriff the fleshy Attaciunent processes of origin alternate with like parts of the transversalis " Â°^ muscle ; but a slight interval separates the slips from the ensiform theTnuscie. process and seventh cartilage, and a second space exists sometimes between the fibres from the last rib and the arch over the quadratus lumborum muscle. In it are certain apertures for the transmission Apertures. of things from the thorax to the abdomen. The muscle is convex towards the chest, and concave to the Vault: abdomen. Its vault reaches higher on the right than the left side, and is constantly varying during life in respiration.

Fig. 176.* \ the central portion is about opposite the xiphi-sternal articulation ; on the right side it rises to the level of the fifth, and on the left side to the sixth chondro-sternal articulation. Special parts of the diaphragm. The following named parts are Special now to be noticed more fully, viz., the central tendon, the pillars, exaiuiued.^ the arches, and the apertures. The central tendon (cordiform tendon) occupies the middle of the ^g'^jj^^j^^^j^j^ diaphragm (fig. 176), and is surrounded by muscular fibres: the large vena cava pierces it. It is of a pearly white colour, and its tendinous fibres cross in difterent directions. In form it is com- pared to a trefoil leaf; of its three lobes or segments the right (c) J^^e a trefoil is the largest, and the left (a) the smallest. * Under surface of the diaphragm. A.

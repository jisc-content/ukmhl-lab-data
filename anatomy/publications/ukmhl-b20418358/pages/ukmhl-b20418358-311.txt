297 ULNAR NERVE. (\ The interosseous artery is a sliort thick trunk, which is interos- ilirected backwards towards the interosseous membrane, and divides into anterior and posterior branches : the two divisions will be afterwards followed. d. Tlie metacarpal branch arises from the artery near the lower metacarpal, end of the nlna, and runs along the metacarxDal bone of the little fingei', of which it is the inner dorsal branch. e. The carpal branches (anterior and posterior) ramify on the and carpal, front and back of the carpus, on which they anastomose with cor- responding offsets of the radial artery, and form arches across the wrist. Peculiarities of the ulnar artenj. The origin of the artery may be trans- The origin ferred to any point of the main vessel in the arm or axilla. In one instance R. Quain found the nlnar artery arising between two and three inches below the elbow. When it begins higher than usual, it is generally superficial to the flexor and courst- muscles at the bend of the elbow, but l^eneatli the aponeurosis of the forearm; may ^ary. though sometimes it is subcutaneous with the superficial veins. The ULNAR NERVE (lig. 96,^) enters the forearm between the ulnar nerve iittachments of the tlexor carpi ulnaris to the olecranon and inner "Jj*^.^ condyle of the humerus. Under cover of that muscle the nerve reaches the ulnar artery somewhat above the middle (in length) of the forearm, and is continued on the inner side of the vessel to the hand. On the annular ligament the nerve is rather deeper than the iirtery. It gives off the following branches :— its branches a. Articular nerves. In the interval between the olecranon and '^^^^^^^^^^ the inner condyle, slender filaments are furnished to the joint. joint, b. Muscular branches arise from the nerve near the elbow, and to two supply the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner half of the flexor pro- ^'^ fundus digitorunr. c. Cutaneous nerve of the forecmii and hand. A small palmar cutaneoni; branch (•') arises about the middle of the forearm, and descends on Jlf*^^ the ulnar artery, sending twigs around that vessel, to end in the hand, integuments of the palm of the hand : sometimes a cutaneous off- set perforates the aponeurosis near the wrist, and joins the internal cutaneous nerve. d. The dorsal cutaneous nerve of the hand leaves the trunk about cutaneons two inches above the end of the ulna, and passes obliquely backwards IH^^'^^ beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris ; perforating the aponeurosis, it is hand, ilistributed on the back of the hand and fingers (p. 289). The MEDIAN NERVE (fig. 96, ^) IcaVCS the hollow of the elbow Median^ between the heads of the pronator teres, and runs in the middle line {Jetween the <3f the limb to the hand. It is placed beneath the flexor sublimis ^yjJ^f^J^J'J^^. •as low as two inches from the annular ligament, where it becomes superficial along the outer border of the tendons of that muscle. Lastly, the nerve passes beneath the annular ligament to the palm of the hand. It supplies the muscles on the front of the forearm, and furnishes a cutaneous offset to the hand.

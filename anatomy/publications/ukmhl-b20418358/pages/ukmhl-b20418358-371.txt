357 VENTRICULAll FIBRES OF HEART. The principal groups of fibres that have been distinguished may be chief sets: arranged as follows ; but it must be understood tliat they are to a great extent intermixed, and that bundles frequently pass from one set into another. a. The external oblique fibres (fig, 118,^) begin at the base of ^^temal the ventricles, Avhere most of them spring from the auriculo-ventri- '^^^^^'^^ cular and arterial fibrous rings, and descend with the spiral course above described to the apex of the heart. On the posterior surface they pass without interruption from, the left to the right ventricle ; but in front the fibres crossing the right ventricle in part dip in at the interventricular groove to the septum, while those continued to the left ventricle are joined by others which issue from the septum along the furrow. At the apex of the heart they form a sharp twist, known as the vortej; or wJiorl, and sink in to become deep and ascend towards the base as the innermost layer of the left ventricle, and internal Some of them are continued to the base and join the auriculo-ventri- longitudinal cirG one' cular and aortic rings ; but others enter the papillary muscles, which are thus formed. b. The transverse or annular fibres (fig, 118,'') are partly special annular; to the left ventricle, and partly common to the two ventricles. Some of them appear to form simple rings round the cavities, but a gieat many pass from this into the oblique system of fibres. c. The looped fibres of the left ventricle spring from the fibrous looped of rings at the base, and passing downwards in the ventricular wall, enter the lower part of the septum, in which they ascend to the central fibro-cartilage. d. Similar looped fibres pass from the outer wall of the right and of right ventricle through the septum to the fibro-cartilage. ventricle ; e. The fioure-of-8 fibres i^ass from the front of the right ventricle figure-of-s libres through the septum to the back of the left, and from the front of the left to the back of the right, the two sets decussating in the septum. Endocardium. LiniuLj the interior of the cavities of the heart IS a Lining thin membrane, which is named endocardium. It is continuous on of*^}^^e^hpart. the one hand with the lining of the veins, and on the other with that of the arteries. Where the membrane passes from an auricle' to a ventricle, or from a ventricle to an artery, it forms duplicatures in which fibrous tissue is enclosed, thus giving rise to the valves ; and in tlie ventricles it covers the tendinous cords, and the project- ing muscular bundles. The thickness of the membrane is greater in the auricles than in the A'Cntricles, and in the left than in the right half of the heart. Great Vessels, Tlie arteries which take origin from the heart 7*?*^?^^^ ^j^^ are the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The large veins entering 'j[*eart!^ the heart, besides the coronary sinus, are the superior and inferior cava3, and the pulmonary. The PULMONARY ARTERY is a short thick trunk, which conveys The pulmo- the dark blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. From "^''^ ^""^^'^ its commencement in the right ventricle the vessel is directed up- wards and backwards on the left of the aorta ; and at a distance of '^^^ an inch and a half or two inches, it divides into two branches for lungs.

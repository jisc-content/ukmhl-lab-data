109 GLOSSO-PIIARYNGEAL NERVE. hnt its large ganglion near tlie skull (upper cervical) should be cleaned, and the branches from it to the pharyngeal plexus should be pursued beneath the carotid artery. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves (glosso-]>haryngeal, Ninth, tenth l^neumo-gastric, and spinal accessory) leave the cranium together nervelr'^"*'' by the jugular foramen (p. 19), from Avhich circumstance the}' were formerly grouped together as one nerve—the eighth nerve of Willis. Outside the skull the nerves take different directions to their des- tination ; thus, the glosso-pharyngeal is inclined forwards to the tongue and pharynx ; the spinal accessory backwards to the sterno- mastoid and trapezius muscles ; and the pneurao-gastric nerA'e descends to the viscera of the thorax and abdomen. The GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE (fig, 28, ') is the Smallest of the Glosso- three trunks. In the jugular foramen it is placed somewhat in }|erve''''''*^ front of the other two, and lies in a groove in the hinder border of the petrous part of the temporal bone. In the aperture of exit the has t\yo nerve is marked by two ganglionic swellings, tlie uj^per one being fonuneiK' the jugular, and the lower the petrosal ganglion. The jugular (janglion ('^) is very small, and is situate at the upi)er its upper end of the osseous groove containing the ner\ e. It includes only the outer fibres of the nerve, and is not always to be recognised. The iMrosal ganglion {") is much larger, and encloses all the fibrils and lower of the nerve. Ovalish in form, it is placed in a hollow in the 8'"iisi'<'ii- posterior border of the temporal bone ; and from it si)ring the branches that unite the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves. After the nerve has quitted the foramen, it comes forwards in the neck- between the jugular vein and the carotid artery (fig. 27, ^), and descends o^ er the artery until it reaches the hinder border of the stylo-pharvnfTeus muscle. Then curving forwards, it becomes almost f'"ii>;«es to ' .

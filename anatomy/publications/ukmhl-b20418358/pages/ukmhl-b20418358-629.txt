COUESE AND COVERINGS OF HEENIA. 615 Septum crurale. Tliat part of tlie subperitoneal fatty layer whicli Cnu-ai is placed over the crural ring has been named crural septum from ^"^P^^^^^ â€¢ its position between the thigh and abdomen. The situation of the position ; septum is now visible, but its characters are ascertained in the dis- liow formed, section of the abdomen (p. 469). Femoral Hernia. In this kind of hernia there is a protrusion Femoral of intestine into the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament. And the gut ^^j^j^j^j^jj^ descends in the crural sheath, being placed on the inner side of the vein. Course. At first the intestine takes a vertical direction in its course; progress from the abdomen, and passes through the crural ring, and first along the crural canal as far as the saphenous opening. At this spot it changes its course, and is directed forwards to the surface next of the thigh, where it becomes elongated transversely ; and should ^nTthen' the gut protrude still farther, the tumour ascends on tlie abdomen, upwards, in consequence of the resistance being less in this direction than o]i the front of the thigh. The winding course of the hernia may suggest to the dissector How it is the direction in which attempts should be made to replace the in- ^"^^ pusiied testine in the abdominal cavity. With the view of making the bowel retrace its course, it will be necessary, if the protrusion is small, to direct it backwards and upwards ; but if the hernia is large, it must be pressed down first to the saphenous opening, and after- wards backwards and upwards towards the crural canal and ring. During the manipulation to return the intestine to its cavity, the thigh is to be raised and rotated inwards, in order that the margin of the saphenous opening and the other structures may be relaxed. Coverings. As the intestine protrudes it is clothed by the follow- coverings ing layers, which are elongated and ]3ushed before it from within ^Qn"^^,^^^' outwards. First is a covering of the peritoneum lining the abdomen, d-m-aisep- which forms the hernial sac. Next one from the septum crurale tum.^crurai across the crural ring. Afterwards comes a stratum from the crural ' sheath, imless -the hernia bursts through an aperture in the side. Over this is sj)read a layer of the cribriform fascia. And, lastly, cribriform there is an investment of the superficial fat or fascia, together with f^^fi^' ^ 5 iD and skin. the skm. The coverings may vary, or may be conjoined in difi'erent degrees The cover- according to the condition of the hernia. In some instances the aitered!^'^ prolongation from the crural sheath is wanting. Farther, in an old hernia the covering derived from the septum crurale is united usually with that from the crural sheath, so as to form one layer, the fascia propria (Cooper). In general, in an operation for the relief of the strangulated bowel, the surgeon, after dividing the ,, subcutaneous fat, can recognise but little of the coverings enume- rated by anatomists until he meets with that of the subperitoneal fat or septum crurale. Diagnosis. This hernial tumour is generally smaller than inguinal, JJ^^^^I^^'^^y^ and does not extend into the scrotum in the male, or the labium in the female ; and if its neck can be traced below Poupart's liga- ment, it can be distinguished certainly from an inguinal hernia.

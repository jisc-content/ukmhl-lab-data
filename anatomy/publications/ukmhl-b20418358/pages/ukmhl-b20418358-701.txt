FOUKTH LAYER OF MUSCLES. 687 dorsal, like the interossei in the hand. Seven in nnmber, there are three plantar and fonr dorsal ; and two are found in each space, except the innermost. The 'plantar muscles (o) are slender fleshy slips, belonging to Three pbm- the outer three toes. Each arises from the under and inner surface outer toes, of the metatarsal bone ; and is inserted partly into the tibial side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the same toe, and partly by an expansion to the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the phalanx. These muscles are smaller than the dorsal, and are placed more in the sole of the foot. The dorsal muscles (i), one in each space, arise by two heads from Four dorsal the lateral surfaces of the bones between which they lie, and are bones.°" inserted like the others into the side, and on the dorsum of the meta- tarsal phalanx of certain toes :—Thus, the inner two muscles belong to the second toe, one to each side ; the next belongs to the outer side of the third toe ; and the remaining one to the outer side of the fourth toe. The interossei are crossed by the external plantar vessels and Relatious. nerve, and their digital branches ; and they lie beneath the adductor transversus hallucis and the metatarsal ligament.

Dissection. Following the tendon of the tibialis j)osticus muscle Trace out from its position behind the inner malleolus to its insertion into the Jendom!' navicular bone, trace the numerous processes that it sends forwards and outwards. Open also the fibrous sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, which crosses from the outer to the inner side of the foot. The tendon of the tibialis posticus is continued forwards over insertion of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint and the internal {f^jaUs pos- calcaneo-navicular ligament, to be iriserted into the tuberosity of the *icus navicular bone. From its insertion processes are continued to many of the other bones of the foot:—One is directed backwards to the "^to tarsus sustentaculum tali of the os calcis. Two offsets are directed for- wards ;—one to the internal cuneiform bone; the other, much the largest, is attached to the middle and outer cuneiform, to the cuboid bone, and to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal "leta- bones. In other words, pieces are fixed into all the tarsal bones ex- cept one (astragalus), and into all the metatarsal bones except two (first and fifth). Where the tendon is placed over the calcaneo-navicular ligament, it contains a fibro-cartilage, or occasionally a sesamoid bone. The tendon of the peroneus longus muscle winds round the insertion of

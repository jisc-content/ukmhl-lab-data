DISSECTION OF THE JBRAIN. 216 situation, (fig. 74). Its central part, wliicli is exposed in the longitudinal extent and fissurc, is naiTow, and measures about three inches in length. It is ^''^' nearer to the anterior than to the posterior end of the cerebrum, and is somewhat arched from before backwards. On each side its upper surface is free for a short distance beneath the callosal convo- lution, from which it is separated by a groove {callosal sulcus). anterior and In front, the C(jrpus callosum is bent downwards, forming the posterior ends; fibres transverse; a few longi- tudinal. gcniL and rostrum as before described (p. 206) ; and behind, it ends in a thickened part named the splenium (fig. 69). The fibres of the corpus callosum are for the most part directed transversely, but on the ujiper surface there is a somewhat irregular, narrow longitudinal band on each side close to the middle line (stria> longitudinales or nerves of Lancisi). Between tlie two bands is a median groove or raphe. Farther out there may be seen other lono'itudinal fibres belonj^infj to the covered band, if that has not Portion of a median section of the brain, showing the corpus callosum, third (3) and fourth (4) ventricles, arbor vitse cerebelli, &c. In front of 3, the soft commissure is seen cut across. Between the infundibulum and the corpus albicans the tuber cinereum, and behind the corpus albicans the posterior perforated space and the united tegmenta are forming the floor of the third ventricle. Above 4, is the superior medullary velum with the lingula, and below are the inferior medullary velum and the nodule. The pia mater and velum interpositum are removed.

700 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. it; and a bursa intervenes between it and the front of the tibia above the tubercle. Dissection (fig. 225). To see the reflections of the synovial mem- brane, raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an incision on each side above the patella. When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the intercondylar fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the x^atella. On each side of the knee-pan is another fold (alar ligament) over some fat. The limb may be laid flat on the table, and some of the posterior ligament removed, to show the pouches of the synovial membrane Fig. 225.* Open the knee-joint in front and behind. which project behind over the condyles of the femur ; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the parts are learnt. Synovial The synovial membrane (fig. 225) lines the interior of the joint, and is continued to the margins of the articular surfaces of the bones. It invests the interarticular fibro-cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and sends a pouch between the tendon of the popliteus and the external fibro-cartilage and the head of the tibia; it is also reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. thrown into There are three named folds of the synovial membrane. One in iSamentr— centre of the joint is the mucous ligament (a), which contains mucous, small vessels and some fat, and extends from the interval between the condyles to the fat below the patella.

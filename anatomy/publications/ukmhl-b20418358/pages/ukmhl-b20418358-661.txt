BRANCHES OF THE SACIiAL PLEXUS. ^47 The descending cutaneous branches (fig. 205,^) supply tlie integu- and iiients of tlie upper tliird of the thigh at the inner and posterior aspects. One of these branches (fig. 206/), which is larger than the branches; others, is distributed to the genital organs, and is named inferior inferior pudendal (p. 431) ; as it courses to the perineum, it turns below the nervT*^^^ ischial tuberosity, and perforates the fascia lata at the inner side of the thigh to end in the scrotum. The GREAT SCIATIC (fig. 206,*^) is the largest nerve in the bodv. Great sciatic *^ I16rV6 * It is the source of all the muscular, and most of the cutaneous ^^^^.^^ . branches to the limb beyond the knee, as well as of the muscular branches at the back of the thigh. At its origin it appears to be a prolongation of the sacral plexus (fig. 207, g s). It is directed through the buttock to the back of course in the thigh, and rests on the external rotator muscles below the pyriformis. Commonly it does not supply any branch to the no branch in buttock, but it may give origin to one or two filaments to the hip- ^'^ region, joint. Frequently the nerve is divided into two large trunks at its origin, and one of them (the external popliteal) pierces the fibres of the pyriformis muscle. The PUDic NERVE (fig. 206,^^) winds over the small sacro-sciatic Pudic nerve, ligament by the side of its companion artery, and is distributed with this vessel to the perineum and the genital organs (p. 427). No branch is supplied to the buttock. Small MUSCULAR branches of the sacral r^lexus are furnished to Muscular ^ branches: the external rotators except the obturator externus. The branch to the pyriformis is seen in the dissection of the sacral to 1 • +1 1 • / R-A\ pyriformis; plexus m the pelvis (p. 5/0). The nerve to the obturator interims (fio-. 208,'') arises from the to obturator ^ o 7 / mternus and up2)er part of the plexus, and is directed to its muscle through the superior small sacro-sciatic foramen with the pudic vessels : it gives off" a g®™^^^*^^' small twig to the superior gemellus ('). The nerve to the qaadratus femoris (fig. 208,") is a slender branch, toquadratus wliich passes with a companion artery beneath the gemelli and the gemeUus. obturator to the anterior surface of its muscle. This branch will be seen more fully in a subsequent dissection, when offsets from it to the inferior gemellus and the hip-joint may be traced. Dissection. To see the remaining external rotator muscles, hook aside the great sciatic nerve, and take away the branches of the sciatic artery if it is necessary. In cleaning these muscles the limb should be rotated inwards. The gemelli are to be separated from tiie tendon of the obturator internus. The SUPERIOR GEMELLUS (fig. 206, c) is the higher of the two ^^^P^^ muscular slips along the sides of the tendon of the obturator muscle. Internally it arises from the outer and lower part of the ischial spine, and externally it is inserted with the obturator into the great trochanter. Occasionally the muscle is absent. The INFERIOR GEMELLUS (fig. 206, e) is larger than its fellow, inferior ... r> 1 . 1 • 1 1 •, gemellus: Its origin is connected with the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, along the lower edge of the groove for the obturator internus muscle ; and its insertion is in common with the obturator tendon.

179 MOVEMENTS OF HEAD. behind tlie neck of tlie process, and is in contact witli the transverse ligament. The posterior synovial sac is larger than the anterior. Occipito-atlantal articulations. A synovial joint is formed between Occipito- the condyle of the occipital bone and the npper articular process of articufa- the atlas on each side. Surrounding the articulation is a capsular tions are ligament of scattered fibres, which is strongest externally and in jokitr^^^ front. When the joint is opened, the elliptical articular surface of articular the condyle will be seen to be convex in all directions, and to look surfaces, outwards as well as downwards. The articular cavity of the atlas has a corresponding direction, upwards and inwards, and is marked by a slight transverse groove, from which the cartilage is often wanting. Atlanto-axial articulations. Three synovial joints exist between Between the atlas and axis. The central articulation is between the anterior axis\re a arch of the atlas and the odontoid process, and has already been ^^^^J^^^'^*^^^* exposed. The lateral articulations are formed on each side by the gliding inferior articular process of the atlas and the upjDer articular joints: surface of the axis. These are united by a loose cajmile (fig. 49, ^), wliich is thickened so as to give rise to an accessory ligament at the inner and posterior aspect of the joint. The articular surface of the articular axis is somewhat convex, and is slo23ed downwards and outwards ; iat/ei\^^ while that of the atlas presents a slight transverse ridge in the middle, so that the opposed surfaces are more extensively in contact when the atlas is turned to one side, than wlien it is placed symmetrically over the axis. Movenmits of the head. The head can be bent forwards—flexion. Movements or backwards—extension ; it can be inclined towards the shoulder ?^ n M • n • 1 1 -1 • -1 • lands ot. —lateral nexion; and it can be turned to either side—rotation. Flexion and extension take place in the joints between the atlas Nodding and occipital bone ; and the range of movement is greater in the seatr'^^'^ forward than in the backward direction. Flexion is limited mainly extent, RllU Cll6CKS. by the long occipito-axial and the check ligaments; extension by the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and by the approximation of the (jccipital bone to the neural arch of the atlas. When the head is moved more freely, flexion and extension of the cervical portion of the spine also come into play. Lateral flexion is effected mainly by movement between the inclination cervical vertebrae ; but a very slight degree may be due to move- place in ^^^'^ ment having its seat in the occipito-atlantal articulations. "eck. Rotation takes place in the atlanto-axial articulations, the atlas Turning and head moving together round the pivot formed by the odontoid between"* process. The movement is stopped by the check ligaments. Less atlas and than half of the whole possible rotation of the head is obtained between the atlas and axis, the rest being made up in the neck. and in neck. Sterno-clavicular articulation (fig. 54). The articular sterno- surfaces of the two bones are not precisely adapted to each other, artrcuiation and an interarticular fibro-cartilage is placed between them. They is a com- are united by a capsular ligament; and the clavicle receives addi- P^^^^'^^J^"^^- tional support from a ligament passing to the first rib-cartilage, and another band connecting it to the bone of the opposite side.

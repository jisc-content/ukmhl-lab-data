631 ADDUCTOR BREVIS MUSCLE. accessory nerve of the obturator wliicli turns beneatli tlie outer boi'der ; if this is present, its branches to the hip-joint and the obturator nerve are to be traced out. The adductor longus is then adduc- to be divided near its origin, and raised with care, so as not to tor longus, destroy the branches of the obturator nerve beneath : its tendon is to be detached frbm that of the adductor magnus beneath it, to see the branches of the profunda artery. Kow the adductor brevis will be laid Tjare. A part of the obtu- to show rator nerve crosses over this muscle to the femoral artery, and sends adductor Drcvis' an offset to the plexus at the inner side of the thigh : a deeper part of the same nerve lies beneath this adductor. The muscle should he separated from the subjacent adductor magnus, where the lower trace l^ranch of the nerve with an artery issues. In this last step of the ^^gj^.^**^^ dissection, the student should follow on and in the fibres of the and branch adductor magnus a slender articular branch of tlie obturator nerve ; t^.^^pee- ' jomt. this will afterwards be traced to the knee (p. 655). The accessory obturator nerve (Schmidt) is derived from the Accessory trunk of the obturator, near the lumbar plexus (p. 542), aud j)asses ^el:"â„¢^ from tlie abdomen over the brim of the pelvis. In the thigh it turns beneath the pectineus, and joins the superficial branch of the obturator nerve ; it supplies an offset to the hip-joint with the articular artery, and occasionally one to the under surface of the pectineus. The ADDUCTOR BREVIS (fig. 204, d) has a fleshy and tendinous j^^^^'J^g^'^' origin, about one inch and a half in depth, from the front of the narrow at pubis below^ the adductor longus, and close outside the gracilis. It "^'S'"' is inserted, behind the pectineus, into all the line leading from the insertion.' linea aspera to the small trochanter. In front of the muscle are the pectineus and the adductor longus. Parts in with the su|)erficial piece of the obturator nerve, and the profunda artery ; but it is gradually uncovered by the adductor longus below, and the contiguous borders of the two are side by side at their in- sertion into the,femur. Behind the muscle is the adductor magnus, behind, with the deep piece of the obturator nerve and a branch of the internal circumflex artery. In contact with the upper border lies and at upper the obturator externus (p), and the internal circumflex artery passes ^o^'*^^^- between the two. Action. This muscle adducts the limb with slight flexion of the Use, hip-joint, like the pectineus. And if it acts from the femur, it will and^tfx^d!'' balance and move forwards the pelvis. The OBTURATOR NERVE (fig. 204, ^) is a branch of the lumbar oi)turator plexus (p. 542), and supplies the adductor muscles of the thigh, as well as the hip and knee-joints. The nerve issues from the pelvis through the aperture in the upper part of the thyroid foramen ; and is di\ idKl it divides in that opening into two j)ieces, which are named super- ^'^^'^ ficial and deep, from their position with respect to the adductor brevis muscle.

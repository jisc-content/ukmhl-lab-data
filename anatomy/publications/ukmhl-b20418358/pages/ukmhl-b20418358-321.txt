'Jo^e; This part of the flexor brevis lies along the inner border of the relations; opponens poUicis, and is superficial to the tendon of the long- flexor. The i'lmer head of the fiexor brevis is a small slip, which is con- inner head cealed by the adductor oblifpius poUicis, and will be subsequently "g^*/.*'^^ seen to pass from the nlnar side of the first metacarpal bone to lie inserted into the first phalanx w^ith that muscle (p. 320). * Deep dissection of the palm of tlie hand.

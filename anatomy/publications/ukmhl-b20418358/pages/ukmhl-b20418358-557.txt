543 SYMPATHETIC CORD. obturator, or from the third and fourth nerves of the plexus. Its course is along the inner border of the psoas, beneath the investing fascia, and over the hip-bone to the thigh, where it ends by joining the obturator nerve, and supplying the hip-joint (p. 631). GaNGLIATED cord of the sympathetic (fig. 178, o). The sympathetic lumbar part of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic is continuous abdoii^eu^*^ vi^ith the thoracic part beneath the internal arched ligament of the ^^y^^^ ^j^^^ diaphragm. It lies on the front of the spinal column, along the in thorax; inner border of the psoas muscle, and is somewhat concealed on the right side by the vena cava, on the left by the aorta. The cord has has four or four or five oval ganglia, which supply connecting and visceral ^'^^ ganglia; branches. Connecting branches. From each ganglion two small branches are branches to directed backwards along the centre of the body of the vertebra, iiei-ves"^^ with the lumbar artery ; these unite with one or two spinal nerves near the intervertebral foramen. The connecting branches are long in the lumbar region, in consequence of the gangliated cord being carried forwards by the psoas muscle. Branches of Distribution. Most of the internal branches throw and to the • • viSCGl'tl themselves into the aortic and hypogastric plexuses, and so reach the viscera indirectly. Some filaments enter the vertebrae and their connecting ligaments. Last dorsal nerve (fig. 178, e). The anterior primary branch of the last dorsal resembles the intercostal nerves in its distribution, but differs from them in not being contained in an intercostal space. Lying below the last rib, the nerve is directed outwards across the course to upper part of the quadratus lumborum, but beneath the external aMomenT arched ligament and the fascia of the quadratus. At the outer border of that muscle it perforates the middle layer of the fascia lumborum, and enters the wall of the abdomen, where it ends in an abdominal and a lateral cutaneous branch (p. 456). The first lumbar artery accompanies it. Near the spine it furnishes a small branch to the quadratus muscle ; branch to and it may -communicate by means of this with the first lumbar nerve. The LUMBAR ARTERIES of the aorta (p. 533) are furnished to the Lumbar RrtcriGS five back, the spinal canal, and the wall of the abdomen : they resemble in number the aortic intercostals in their course and distribution. Commonly ^JJg^^^^ five in number on each side, they arise from the back of the aorta, and the vessels of opposite sides are sometimes joined in a common trunk. They then pass backwards over the hollowed surface of the course; bodies of the last dorsal and upper four lumbar vertebrce, and beneath the pillar of the diaphragm and the psoas, to reach the nation In^" interval between the transverse processes, where each ends in an abdominal and a dorsal branch. The arteries of the right side lie beneath the vena cava. The posterior or dorsal branches continue to the back between the '^j^^^'^^^j! transverse processes, and supply offsets to the spinal canal (pp. 404, 421). The anterior or abdominal branches are directed outwards, and enter ^^^^ ^ ' branch to

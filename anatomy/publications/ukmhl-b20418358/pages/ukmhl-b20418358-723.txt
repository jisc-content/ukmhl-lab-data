MOVEMENTS IN ANKLE-JOITsiT. and the posterior and middle pieces of tlie external lateral, and tlie posterior part of tlie internal lateral ligament, are made tense. In extension the astragalus moves forwards over the end of the Extension tibia, and projects anteriorly. A limit to the movement is imposed moving by the meeting of the astragalus with the tibia behind. ^^^^' The lateral ligaments are partly made tight as in flexion, for state of instance, the anterior piece of the external, and the fore and middle ^^s^â„¢^"*^ portions of the internal. When the joint is half extended, so that the small hinder part of slight later the astragalus is brought into the arch of the leg-bones, a slight movement of the foot inwards and outwards may sometimes be obtained ; but if the foot is forcibly extended, the portions of the Literal ligaments attached to the astragalus prevent this lateral movement by their tightness. Dissection. The joints of the foot will be demonstrated by re- Dissection moving from both the dorsum and the sole all the soft parts which J^j^^j^g^Qf have been examined. Between the clifl'erent tarsal bones bands of the foot, ligament extend, which will be defined by removing the areolar tissue from the intervals between them (fig. 230). It will be more advantageous for the student to clean all the ligaments before he proceeds to learn any, than to prepare only the bands of one articulation at a time. Articulation of the astragalus and os calcis. These bones Astragalus form two joints, and are kept together by a strong interosseous liga- J^idg'^^y ment; there are also thin bands on each side and behind.

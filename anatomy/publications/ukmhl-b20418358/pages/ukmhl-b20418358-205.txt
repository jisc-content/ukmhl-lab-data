Decj) origin. In the valve of Yiensscns the nerve crosses to the opposite nucleus in side, decussating with its fellow, and then arches round the aqueduct of floor of Sylvius to reach its nucleus in the floor of that canal, immediately below the ^yl^'iau nucleus of the third nerve. ^^^^ ' The FIFTH or trigeminal (^) is the largest of the cranial nerves, Fifth nerve and consists of two roots, ganglionic or sensory, and aganglionic or j^^^^g^^'" niotor^ which are separate to beyond the ganglion. The nerve is attached to the side of the pons Varolii, nearer the both issuing upper than the lower border. The small or aganglionic root is ^^"^"^ P*'"^- the higher, and is separated from the large root by one or two of the transverse bundles of the pons. Both roots pass outwards through an aperture in the dura mater, above the petrous part of the temporal bone, and join in the peculiar manner stated on page 18. Beep origin. The large root divides within the pons into two parts. One peep origin of these is connected with a mass of grey matter (sensory nucleus of the fifth) of large root near the floor of the fourth ventricle : the other (ascending root of the fifth ; i'|g|?|y"fa^'^'"^ fig. 63) arises from the cells of the posterior horn of the grey matter in the oblono-ata • lower part of the medulla oblongata and upper part of the spinal cord, and is directed upwards on the outer surface of the gelatinous substance of Rolando (p. 200) to join the uj^per part. The small root also has a double origin, one part springing from a special of small in nucleus (motor nucleus of the fifth) in the floor of the fourth ventricle internal pons and to the sensory nucleus,'and the other (descending root of the fifth ; fig. 78) I'^'^^-^rain. from a collection of nerve-cells on the side of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The SIXTH NERVE C^), abducent nerve of the eyeball, springs from sixth nerve from pyramid, the outer part of the pyramidal body close to the pons, and often ^^'""^ by a second band from the lower border of the pons. Deep origin. ' The fibres of the nerve pass backwards, through the lower and nucleus part of the pons, to a nucleus in the floor of the foui-th ventricle, beneath the heneath outer part of the fasciculus teres (fig. 63). (^ntricle The SEVENTH or facial nerve (portio dura of the seventh pair, seventh Willis ;appears at the lower border of the pons, to which it is S^.a/tract closely adherent, in the depression between the upper ends of the of bulb:' olivary and restiform bodies. A small accessory Inmdle {j^ortio IXi'mediate intermedia of Wrisberg) leaves the medulla oblongata between the P'^rtion. facial and the auditory nerves, and joins the former within the iuternal auditory meatus. Deep origin. The fibres of the facial nerve pass backwards to the floor of Deep origin the fourth ventricle, and there Avind round the nucleus of the sixth nerve; to ^'om a join a group of nerve-cells lying in front and to the outer side of the latter ^OTga^part (fig. 63). Whether some of the fibres are connected with the cells of the of pons, nucleus of the sixth is uncertain. • The eighth or auditory nerve (portio mollis of the seventh Eighth nerve from

257 AXILLARY ARTERY. On the acromial side lie the cords of the brachial plexus ; and nerve superficial to it is the external anterior thoracic nerve; and beneath it is the posterior thoracic. In its second 'part, the pectoralis minor and major (b and a) are Beneath superficial to the artery. But there is not any muscle immediately pectoral: in contact behind, for the vessel is placed across the top of the ^^^^^^ ^ i muscles, axilla, particularly when the limb is in the position required by the dissection. The companion vein (cj) lies to the inner side, but separated from vein, the arterial trunk by the inner cord of the brachial plexus. In this position the cords of the brachial plexus lie around it, one and nerves being outside, another inside, and the third behind the artery. Beyond the 'pectoralis minor, the artery is at first concealed by And beyond the lower border of the great pectoral muscle (a) ; but thence to pectoral: * Second view of the dissection of the chest (Illustrations of Dissections).

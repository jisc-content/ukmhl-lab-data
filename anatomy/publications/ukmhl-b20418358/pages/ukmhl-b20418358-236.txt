The upper surface is in contact with the fornix, to which it supplies vessels. The lower surface, looking to the third ventricle, covers the pineal body and a part of each optic thalamus : on it, close to the middle line, are the two choroid plexuses of the third ventricle ; and along each side is the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. The CHOROID PLEXUS OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE (fig. 71,/) is the red, somewhat rounded and fringed margin of the velum inter- positum, which projects into the lateral ventricle, extending from the foramen of Monro to the extrennty of the descending cornu. Its lower part is larger than the upper. The epithelium lining the * Second view of the dissection of the brain, the fornix being cut through in front and raised, a. Fornix, b. Hippocampus major, c.

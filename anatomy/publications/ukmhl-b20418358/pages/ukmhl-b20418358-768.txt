754 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. Vpssels of IVibyrintli. Auditory uvtery froii l»asilar, lias a viistibulav, an'I a cochleaf branch. Veins to )ietrosal sinuses and internal jugular. Blood-Vessels. The meniln-aiies of the labyrinth are supplied l^y an artery which enters the internal auditory meatus with the auditoiy nerve. The veins are more numerous. The INTERNAL AUDITORY ARTERY arises froni the basilar trunk within tlie skull (p. 186), and divides in the internal auditory meatus into two branches,—one for the vestibule, and the other for the cochlea. The vestihular artery subdivides into small offsets which enter the cavity with the branches of the auditory nerve, and ramify over the sacs and the semicircular canals. The cochlear branch breaks up into numerous fine twigs which enter the modiolus and the canals in the lamina spiralis. Offset*; supply the nerve and the parts in the neighbourhood of the limbus lamina? spiralis, and others ramify in the periosteal lining of the scalre ; but there are no vessels in the outer part of the membrana 'basilaris. Veins. The internal auditory vein accompanies the artery, and ends in the inferior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. The veiii of the aqueduct of the cochlea joins the internal jugular ; and the rein of the aqueduct of the vestihtde opens into the superior petrosal sinus.

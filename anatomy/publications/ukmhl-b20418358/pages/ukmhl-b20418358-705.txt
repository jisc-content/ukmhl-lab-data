MUSCLES ON THE FRONT. 691 aud foot. Tibialis anticus : The Muscles on the Front of the Leg (fig. 222) are four in Muscles on number. Tlie large muscle next the tibia is the tibialis anticus ; f^^^^^ that next the fibula, the extensor longus digitorum ; while a small muscle, apparently the lower end of the last with a separate tendon to the fifth metatarsal bone, is the peroneus tertius. The muscle between the tibialis and extensor digitorum, in the lower part of the leg, is the extensor proprius hallucis. On the dorsum of the foot only one other muscle appears, the extensor brevis digitorum. The TIBIALIS ANTICUS (fig. 222,^) reaches the tarsus : it is thick and fleshy in the upper, but tendinous in the lower part of the leg. It arises from the outer tuberosity, and the upper half of the external °"Sin ; surface of the tibia; from the contiguous part of the interosseous membrane ; and from the fascia of the leg, and the intermuscular ^^eptum between it and the extensor longus digitorum. Its tendon begins below the middle of the leg, and passes beneath both pieces of the annular ligament, where it is surrounded by a synovial sheath, to be inserted into the internal cuneiform bone, and the metatarsal "^sertion; bone of the great toe. The muscle is subaponeurotic. It lies at first outside the tibia, rest- contact- ing on the interosseous membrane; but it is then placed successively over the end of the tibia, the ankle-joint, and the inner tarsal bones. On its outer side are the extensor muscles of the toes, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Action. Supposing the foot not fixed, the tibialis bends the ankle, fg^^^^^f^.^g ^ and raises the inner border of the foot. If the foot is fixed, it can lift the inner border with the tibialis and ftxed posticus, and support the foot on the outer edge. If the tibia is slanting backwards, as when the advanced limb reaches the ground in walking, it can Imng forwards and make r^teady that bone. The EXTENSOR PROPRIUS HALLUCIS (ext. prop. pollicis pedis; j^^^^^®",^'^^' fig. 222) is deeply placed at its origin l)etween the former muscle haifucis: -and the extensor longus digitorum, l)ut its tendon becomes superficial on the dorsum of the foot. The muscle arises from the middle two- ^^^^ /^"^"^ fourths of the narrow anterior surface of the fibula, and from the interosseous membrane for the same distance. At the ankle it ends in a tendon, which comes to the surface through a sheath in the insertion to lower piece of the annular ligament, and continues over the tarsus ^^^^^ ' to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. The anterior tibial vessels lie on the inner side of the muscle at it crosses its origin, but afterwards on the outer side of its tendon, so that ^'^ssels; they are crossed by it in the lower third of the leg. Action. It straightens the great toe by extending the phalangeal °" joints, and afterwards bends the ankle. When the foot is fixed on tlie ground and the tibia slants back- on tibia, wards, the muscle can draw forwards that bone. The EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM (fig. 222,") is flesliy in the leg, ^^^^J"^^^' and tendinous on the foot, like the other muscles. Its origin is from digftomm the head, and upper three-fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula; Y Y 2

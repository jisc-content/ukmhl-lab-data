DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. Lower meatus Spheno- ethmoidal fore part of the lateral wall of the meatus, bounded below by the uncinate process of the ethmoid, and leading upwards through the infundibulum of the latter bone to the frontal sinus. Into the groove lower down the anterior ethmoidal cells open, and at its hindmost part is a small aperture leading into the antrum of the superior maxilla. Above the hiatus is an opening leading into the middle ethmoidal cells ; and in some cases there is a second opening into the antrum close above the lower turbinate bone. The inferior meatus (fig. 33), is wider than the middle one, and extends the whole length of the hard palate. Near its anterior extremity is the opening of the nasal duct (fig. 35). Above the superior meatus, in an angle formed by the roof, there is a vertical depression called the spheno-ethmoidal lecess, (fig. 35), on the posterior wall of which the sphenoidal sinus opens ; and occasion- Agger nasi, A fourth ally a small fourth meatus, communicating with a posterior sometfmes ethmoidal cell, is present between the recess and the superior meatus. In front of the attached border of the middle turbinate bone there is usually to be seen a faint ridge, the agger nasi, directed obliquely and atrium, downwards and forwards, and forming the upper boundary of a slight hollow known as the atrium of the middle meatus. Nares. The 7iares. In the recent condition of the nose each fossa has a distinct anterior opening on the face, and another in the pharynx ; but in the skeleton there is only one common opening in front for both sides. These apertures ancl their boundaries have been before described (pp. 30 and 126). * Outer wall of right nasal fossa. The whole of the middle, and the fore part of the lower turbinate bones have been cut away, to show the openings in the middle and inferior meatuses.

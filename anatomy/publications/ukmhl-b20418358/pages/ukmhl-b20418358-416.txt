DISSECTION OF THE BACK. 402 the recti and obliqiii muscles. In parsing from the spinal canal it is placed between the arch of the atlas and the vertebral artery. From its extremity branches radiate to the surrounding muscles, viz., one to the upper part of the complexus, another to the rectus posticus major and minor, and two short branches to the obliquus superior and inferior: the offset to the last muscle joins the inner branch of the second cervical nerve. Occasionally the hrst nerve gives a cutaneous branch to the occiput, Dorsal '-^ Ix THE DORSAL REGiox. The posterior primary divisions of )iei\es. ^1^^ dorsal nerves, twelve in number, appear between the transverse |)rocesses, and bifurcate into internal and external branches. * Deep dissection of the back of the neck.

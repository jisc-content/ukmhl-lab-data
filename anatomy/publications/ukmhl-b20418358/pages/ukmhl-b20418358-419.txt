The slips differ in length, and form three layers, which are described as separate muscles, viz., a superficial sub- stratum of long slips, confined to the cervical and dorsal regions— ^"^'^^'on^. the seniispinalis ; a middle portion, with slips of intermediate length—the niultifidus spina3; and a deep set of very short fasci- culi, present only in tlie thoracic region—the rotatores dorsi. The semispinalis and niultifidus are only to be separated with difficulty ; but the rotatores are more distinct, and are included in the next layer. The SEMiSPiNAiJS consists of slips which pass over four or five Semispiuaiis vertebrae, and is su1)divided into the following two parts, but the jfito^^^^^ separation between them is not always distinct. The semisjmialis dorsi is thinner than the upper part : it arises jiemispinaiis from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrse from the sixth ^^^^^ to the tenth, and is inserted into the spines of last two cervical and upper four dorsal vertebra). The semispinal is colli (fig. 133, g) arises from the transverse and semispi- processes of the upper six dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the ^^^^'^ .spines of the cervical vertebra) above the last, the atlas not receiving any slip. Dissection. The upper part of the niultifidus sjDina) is to be pre- Dissection pared by the dissector of the head and neck. It will be exposed by tiu^spina- cutting through the insertion of the semispinalis, and turning aside tliat muscle. ^ Over the sacrum the thick aponeurosis of the erector spiiite must be removed. In the dorsal region the niultifidus spinas will appear on detaching and refiecting the semispinalis from the spines. The slips by which the muscle is attached to the processes of the vertebrae should be defined and separated. The MULTIFIDUS SPiNzE reaches from the sacrum to the axis : , it is larger below than above, and is smallest in the upper dorsal spinai region. It takes origin at the pelvis from the back of the sacrum from pelvis. l)etween the spines and the external row of processes as low as the fourth aperture, from the posterior sacro-iliac ligament, from the inner side of the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and from the overlying tendon of the erector spinas ; in the loins it arises by large froiuiuinku-, fasciculi from the mamillary processes of the vertebras ; in the '^'^^'^^^^ ^^'^^ dorsal region by thinner slips from the transverse processes ; and in the neck from the articular processes of the lower four cervical . vertebrae. From these attachments the fibres are directed obliquely upwards and inwards, passing over from one to three vertebrae, to be inserted into the spinous processes from the axis to the last insertion lumbar vertebra. into spines. * The transverso-spinales are entirely concealed by the erector Relations of ,, ,, IT - transverso- spmae and complexus muscles ; and beneath them are the laminae spinaies; of the vertebras, with the dorsal spinal plexus of veins.

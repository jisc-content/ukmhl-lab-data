37 FACIAL NEHVE. The Facial Nerve outside the Skull (fig. 10, ^^). The nerve Branches issues from the stylo-mastoid foramen, after traversing the aqueduct skull of Fallopius, and furnishes immediately the three following small branches :â€” The posterior auricular branch (fio^. 10, ^) turns upwards in front Posterior 1 , \o7/ i rr'i'i auricular 01 the mastoid process, where it communicates with an offset of the branch, great auricular, and is also joined by a branch to the ear from the pneumo-gastric nerve; it ends in auricular and mastoid offsets (p. 8). The branch to the digastric muscle arises generally in common Branch ta with the next. It is distributed by several offsets to the posterior digastric belly of the muscle near the skull. * Superficial nerves of the face. 7. Nasal nerve. 8. Infratrochlear. 9. Subcutaneous malar. 11. Infraorbital. 12. Buccal. 13. Mental. 15. Facial nerve, sending back the posterior auricular branch, 4, and forwards its numerous offsets to join the branches of the fifth nerve above enumerated.

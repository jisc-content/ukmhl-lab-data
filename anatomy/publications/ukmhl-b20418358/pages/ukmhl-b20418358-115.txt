The beginning of the nerve in the cranium has been already demonstrated (p. 18). Dissection. In the spheno-maxillaiy fossa the nerve can be partly Dissection seen l)y the dissection already made for the orbit, and its exposure |[}axmr*'' here will be completed by removing the fat, and cutting away fossa more of the great wing of the splienoid bone, so as to leave only an osseous ring round tlie mirve at its exit from the skull. In the fossa the student seeks tlie following olfsets,—the orbital l)ranch entering Um cavity of the orbit, lu'anches to Meckel's ganglion which Fig. 26.* descend in tlie fossa, and llie posterior dental lu'anch along the back <jf the u])per jaw. To follow (uiwards tlu^ nerve in the floor of tlie orbit, the con-in floor of tents of tlie cfuMty having been taken away, tlie bony canal in which it lies must l)e (Opened to its termination on the face. From the infraorbital canal tlie aiiterior and middle dental branches are to be traced downwards for some distance in the Ixme. The infra- infraorbital orbital vessels are ]»repared with the nerve. vessels. The suPKRioR :\iAXILLARY NERVE (fig. 20) commences at the Upper max- Gasserian ganglion (p. 18), and leaves the craiuum by the foramen ^I'^^^y rotundum. The course of the nerve is almost straight to the face, passes to across the spheno-maxillary fossa, and along the orbital plate of ^^^^ the U2)per maxilla through the infraorljital canal. Issuing from tiiroiiy;ii the canal hy the infraorbital foramen, where it is c(jncealed by the "anar^^*^^ elevator of the upjx^r lip, it ends in infraorbital or facial branches which radiate to the eyelid, nose, and upper lip. * Diagram of the superior maxillary nerve. 2.

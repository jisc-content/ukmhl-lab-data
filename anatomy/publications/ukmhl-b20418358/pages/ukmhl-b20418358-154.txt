140 DISSECTION OF THE JSTOSE. Mucous membrane in sinuses. Dissection of nerves and vessels. yellowish colour. Its epithelium is columnar, but not ciliated; and it is thickly heset with simple tubular glands. In the sinuses the mucous lining is thin and pale, and its glands are few and small. Dissection. At tliis stage of the dissection, but little will be seen of the distribution of the olfactory nerves. If the septum be removed, so as to leave entire the membrane covering it on the left side, the nervous filaments will appear on the surface, near- the cribriform plate. In the membrane, near the front of the septum, an offset of the nasal nerve is to be found. The naso-palatine nerve and artery (fig. 36, are to be sought lower down, as they are directed from behind forwards, towards the anterior palatine fossa; the artery is readily seen, especially if Olfactory nerves; inner set: it is injected, but the fine nerve is embedded in the membrane, and will be found hj scraping with the point of the scalpel. By cutting through the fore and upper part of the membrane detached from the septum nasi, other branches of the olfactory nerve may be traced on the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The OLFACTORY NERVES spring from the under surface of the olfactory bulb as it lies on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (fig. 36, ^), and descend to the olfactory region of the nose through the apertures in this part of the roof. They are about twenty in number, and are divided into two sets. Those of the inner set are the larger, and run downwards in the grooves on the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, to be distributed over the upper third of the Nerves of the septum of the nose. 1. Olfactory bulb and inner set of olfactory nerves. 2. Nasal nerve of the ophthalmic trunk. 3. Naso-palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion (too large in the cut).

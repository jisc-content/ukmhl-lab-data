NERVES OF TYMPANUM. 745 The TYMPANIC BRANCH OF THE GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE Tyiiipauk' (fig. 246,2; nerve of Jacobson, p. 109) enters a special aperture in "^"'"^ the temporal bone (fig. 242, dy), to reach the inner wall of the tym- supplies panum. In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining meinbrane, membrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Fig. 246.* Eustachian tul)e ; and it terminates in the three undermentioned f . , , . , . , . , branches, branches, which are contained m grooves on the promontory, and viz., connect this nerve with others. Branches. On^ branch is arched forwards and downwards, and '>'ie to s> m- enters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (^) i^^*^^^*'^' on the artery (p. 115). The second (''') is the small deep jJ^ii'osal nerve, which is directed pgtj34ar'' forwards through a canal beneath the cochleariform process, to join nerve, the carotid plexus of the sympathetic (sometimes also the large superficial petrosal nerve) in the foramen lacerum. And the third (^) has the foUoAving course :â€”It ascends in front and sinaii of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on the jxitrosai facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments (fig. 38). Be- yond the union with the facial, the nerve is named small suijerficial * Jacobson's nerve in the tympanum (Breschet). a. Carotid artery, b. Tensor tympani muscle, c. Inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve, d. Otic ganglion. Nerves: 1. Petrosal ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. 2. Nerve of Jacobson. 3. Sympathetic on the carotid. 4. Small superficial petrosal nerve. 5. Small deep petrosal nerve. 6. Branch to Eustachian tube. 7. Facial nerve. 8. Chorda tympani. 9. Nerve of the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle.

ERECTOR SPIN^. 397 erector (ilio-costalis), and is to be separated from the inuscles around. The other is a larger offset of the inner piece of the erector (longis- simus dorsi) ; single at first where it is united with the fibres of the longissimus, it is divided afterwards, like the splenius, into a cranial part (trachelo-mastoid) and a cervical part (transversalis colli). * The serratus inferior is to be detached from the spines and Show the thrown outwards, when fine nerves will be found entering it like spjnse and its those to the upper muscle. The superficial layer of the fascia divisions, lumborum is also to be removed, and the areolar tissue is to be cleaned from the surface of the large mass of the erector spinse which now comes into view. Opposite the last rib is an inter- muscular interval, which divides the erector spince into an outer piece (ilio-costalis), and an inner (longissimus dorsi). By sinking nio- the knife into this interval the sacro-lumbalis may be turned out-^"'^'•'^^•'^^^ • wards, so as to uncover the fleshy slips of its accessory muscle, which are fixed to the angles of the ribs : a muscular sli]» (cervicalis its offset to ascendens) is prolonged from this to the neck. ^^'^ '''' In preparing the ilio-costalis muscle, the external branches of Vessels and the dorsal nerves with their accompanying arteries will appear. nerves. * The attachments of the longissimus dorsi are then to be traced Longissimus out. Externally it has thin muscular slips of insertion into about the lower nine ribs, and thicker processes passing to the transverse outer processes of the lumbar vertebrce ; the latter may be shown by raising the outer border of the erector, and clearing away the fat between it and the middle layer of the fascia lumborum. Intei-nally the longissimus is inserted into the transverse processes of the dorsal, ami inner and the accessory processes of the lumbar vertebrae by rounded ^'i^^''*^^""* • tendons ; and to see these it will be necessary to detach a thin tendinous and muscular portion of the erector (spinalis dorsi) from spinalis the inner side of the longissimus, and to divide longitudinally the ^^^^^^' part of the thick aponeurosis springing from the lumbar spines, so as to separate the erector from the subjacent multifidus spina?, f'ffsets to the From the longissimus, as from the ilio-costalis, a fleshy piece (trans- A^ersalis colli and trachelo-mastoid) is continued into the neck. Between the longissimus and the multifidus spinae are the in- Vessels and ternal branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal and lumbar nerves, witli offsets of the intercostal and lumbar vessels. * Erector Spin.-e. This is the muscular mass on the side of the Erector spine, extending from the lower part of the sacrum to the head. It single is single and pointed below, attains it greatest size in the loins, and ^^low, over the thorax becomes divided into secondary portions to which special names are given. Its prolongations to the neck and head ^^^1^^^^'?^^ are very slender. On its posterior surface, in the lumbar and sacral 'gypgrflgj.j, regions, is a strong flat tendon of origin, from which most of the tendon; fleshy fibres spring. The muscle arises internally from the lower two or three dorsal, and all the lumbar and sacral spines ; externally origin, from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest at the inner aspect; and inferiorly from the lower part of the back of the sacrum. Below the last rib it divides into the ilio-costalis and longissimus dorsi ; and in the thoracic region the spinalis dorsi is given oft' from the inner side of the latter part.

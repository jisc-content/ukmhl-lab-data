ANATOMY OF FEMALE VISCERA. 685 The mucous membrane has the same general structure as in the ^J^g'\\^^^JJ^'J^g^^ colon, but towards the anus the secretory apparatus gradually dis- appears. Blood-vessels. The arteries are supplied from three different sources, Artsries: viz., superior hemorrhoidal of the inferior mesenteric, middle hsemorrhoidal of tlie internal iliac, and inferior lisemorrhoidal of the internal pudic. All three sets anastomose on the lower end of the gut ; but only the upper hasmorrhoidal, which is the largest, re- quires farther notice. The final branches of this artery (p. 567), ^^^^p^^®"*^ about six in number, pierce the muscular layer three inches from hEemor-'^^^^ the anus, and descend between the mucous and muscular coats as i"hoidaL far as the internal spliincter, where they unite in loops just within the anus. The veins have no valves, and communicate freely in a large plexus (hsemorrhoidal) between the muscular and mucous coats, valves, round the lower end of the gut. Above they join tlie inferior mesenteric vein, and througli it reach the vena portse ; and below they pour some blood into the internal iliac vein by the middle and inferior hoemorrhoidal branches. Nerves and lymphatics. The nerves of the intestine are obtained Nerves, from the sympathetic; but those of the external sphincter come from the spinal nerves. Tlie lynqjhatics terminate in the chain of Lymphatics, glands on the sacrum. Section YI. AXATOMY OF THE FEMALE PELVIC VISCERA. In the pelvis are contained the viscera alike in both sexes, viz.. Viscera iu the bladder, urethra, and rectum, and those special to the female, ^^'^ I'^ivib. or the organs oi generation. Dissection. The contents of the pelvis are to he removed, together To remove with the genital organs. For this purpose the student should keep ^® visceia, the scalpel close to the osseous boundary of the pelvic outlet, to avoid injuring the end of the rectum ; and he should also detach the crus of the clitoris from the bone. After the parts are taken from the body, the rectum is to be ami prepare separated from the uterus and the vagina, but the rest of the viscera may remain united until after the genital organs are examined. The bladder and rectum may be moderately distended; and the fat and areolar tissue are to be removed from the viscera. GENITAL ORGANS. The genital organs, or external organs of generation, consist of External the following parts :—the mons Veneris and external labia, the generation, clitoris and internal labia, and the vestibule with the meatus urinarius. Within the internal labia is the aperture of the vagina, with the hymen. The name vulva or pudendum is applied to these

POSTERIOR CERVICAL VESSELS. * The external branches increase in size from above downwards, Outer and pass beneatli the longissimiis dorsi to the interval between that erector^^ muscle and the ilio-costalis, distributing offsets to the several spinse: divisions of the erector spinas. The branches of the iq^per six or seven nerves end in these muscles ; but the lower five or six, after reaching tlie interval between the longissimus and ilio-costalis, are lower ones continued to the surface through the serratus and latissimus muscles, cutaneous, nearly in a line with the angles of the ribs. * The internal branches are larger above than below, and supply Inner the transverso-spinales muscles. The u^oijer six or seve^i are directed transvei^o-' inwards between the semispinalis and multifidus spinse, and become spinaies : cutaneous by the side of the spinous processes, after perforating the J^m^er ones splenius, serratus superior, rhomboideus, and trapezius muscles, surface. The loiver five or six ar(^ much smaller, and end in the multifidus .spinae. * In the loixs. The posterior primary branches of the lumbar Lumbar nerves, five in number, appear between the erector and multifidus divided intr> spinse. In their mode of dividing and general arrangement they resemble the lower dorsal nerves, cutaneous offsets being furnished by the external set of branches. * The external branches pass to the erector spinas, and supply it External and the intertransverse muscles. The first three pierce the erector ^^^^"^^^^^ • spinoe, and become cutaneous after perforating the posterior layer of f.econle^^'^ the fascia lumborum. The Ijrancli of the last nerve is connected cutaneous, with the corresponding jiart of the first sacral nerve by an offset near the bones. * The internal branches are furnished to the multifidus spina) internal muscle. They are difficult to find, being contained in grooves on ^I'^^^'^i^^*'- the upper articular processes. * Vessels in the ]3A.ck. The vessels now dissected are the Vessels, occipital and the deep cervical arteries, a small part of the vertebral, and the posterior branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries of the aorta. Veins accompany the arteries. The OCCIPITAL ARTERY (fig. 133, «) courscs along the occipital Part of the bone. Appearing from beneath the digastric muscle, the vessel is arterv^'^' directed backwards under the sterno-mastoid, the splenius, and usually the trachelo-mastoid, but over the obliquus superior and coniplexus muscles. Behind the insertion of the sterno-mastoid it becomes superficial, and ascends to the occiput, where it is dis- tributed (p. 6). It supplies the surrounding muscles, and gives the Aviiich following branch to the neck :— ^^^'^^ ^ The cervical branch (b) distributes twigs to the splenius and trapezius, and passing beneath the complexus, anastomoses with the vertebral and deep cervical arteries. The VERTEBRAL ARTERY (fig. 133, c) lies on the neural arch of P^'^'* of tiie the atlas, behind the articulating process, and appears in the interval artery, between the straight and oblique muscles. Beneath it is the sub- occipital nerve. Small branches are given to the surrounding muscles, and to anastomose with the contiguous arteries. The DEEP CERVICAL ARTERY (fig. 133, e) is a branch of the SUpe- Deep cervi- cal artei-v. D D 2

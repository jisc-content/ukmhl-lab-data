DISSECTION OF THE EAR. 750 recent state dividing the tube of tlie coclilea into two j^assages, con- sists of an osseous and a membranous portion :— Osseous The osseous paii (^), formed by the lamina spiralis, extends about ^^^^ half-way across the tube. Inferiorly it begins in the vestibule, where it is wide, and is attached to the outer wall so as to shut out the fenestra rotunda from that cavity ; and diminishing in size, it ends ends above in a x'oint over an apei'tnre. Lamina spiralis has linibus on upper surface. Spiral prroove. Mem- branous part above in a point—the hamulus, op2)osite the last half-turn of the cochlea. Between the hamulus and the axis is a space, which is converted by the membranous piece of the septum into a foramen (hiatus, helicotrema ; fig. 249,/), and allows the intercommunica- tion of the two chief passages of the cochlear tube. The lamina spiralis is formed by two plates of bone, which en- close canals for vessels and nerves, and are separated farthest from each other at the axis. The upper surface of the lamina is covered in the outer fourth of its extent by a border or limbus of fibrous structure (a), which ends in wedge-shaped teeth near the margin of the bony plate. Between the teeth and the underlying bone is a channel (b) which is called sulcus spiralis: its edges are named vestibular (a) and tympanic (c).

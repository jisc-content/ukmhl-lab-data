PEEFACE. In this edition of the Demonstrations of Anatomy, the scope and arrangement of the Work remain as in the last; but such additions and alterations have been made as were required by the progress of knowledge and were adapted to the character of the book as a guide to practical study. In its preparation I have received much assistance from my brother, Dr. E. H. Thane, Demonstrator of Anatomy in University College, London, on whom has fallen the greater part of the labour of seeing the work through the press. The number of illustrations has been increased by the addi- tion of ten new woodcuts. G. D. THANE. Aiujud, 1890.

227 ANTERIOR COMMISSURE. niicleus and the optic thalamus. In front, the band becomes broader and joins the piUar of the fornix ; behind, it is continued with the tail of the caudate nucleus into the roof of the descending oornu of the lateral ventricle, at the lower end of which it joins the amygdaloid nucleus. Dissection. The anterior commissure is next to be exposed in its Anterior course through the cerebral hemisphere. For this purpose the si^g™'^ remaining fore part of the caudate nucleus, the white fibres, and the fUssectiou lenticular nucleus, on the right side, must be successively scraped show it; away with the handle of the scalpel, and the rounded band traced outwards from the spot where it is seen at the front of the third \'entricle to the medullary centre of tlie temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The ANTERIOR COMMISSURE is a round bundle of white fibres its form, about as large as a crow-(|uill, wliich is free only for about an eighth of an inch in the middle of its extent, where it lies in front of the position, pillars of the fornix (fig. 74). Laterally, it passes outwards beneath the corpus striatum, lying between the lenticular nucleus and the course, and grey matter of the anterior perforated space, and curving backwards, spreads out in the white substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe ending, above the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. The OPTIC THALAMUS (fig. 72, b) is an oval-shaped body which takes Optic ^^^^ ]»art in bounding the lateral and third ventricles.

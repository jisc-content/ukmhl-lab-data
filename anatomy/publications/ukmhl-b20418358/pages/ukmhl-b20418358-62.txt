DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT, ■4S is attached to a bony point on the lower border of the sphenoidal hssnre, near the inner end, while some of its muscular fibres are insertior.. also connected with a tendinous band between the heads. All the muscles are directed forwards, the lower also obliquely outwards, and have a tendinous insertion into the ball of the eye about a quarter of an inch from the cornea, and in front of the greatest transverse diameter of the ball. headlof Between the heads of origin of the external rectus, the different outer rectus. nerves before mentioned are transmitted into the orbit, viz., the third, the nasal branch of the fifth, and the sixth, together with the ophthalmic veins. Use of all; Action. The four recti muscles, attached to the eyeball at oppo- site sides in front of the greatest transverse diameter, are able to turn the pupil in opposite directions, inner and The inner and the outer muscles move the ball horizontally outer, around a vertical axis, the former directing the pupil towards the nose and the latter towards the temple.

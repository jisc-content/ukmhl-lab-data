COCHLEAR PASSAGES. 751 m h) reaches from the lower (tympanic) edge (c) of the lamina includes spiralis to the outer wall of the cochlear tube, where it is fixed hj brane^"^^"^' a fibrous band—ligamentum sinrale C). Its width varies, for near and spiral the base of the cochlea it forms half of the partition across the tube; i^s^"^^^*- but at the apex, where the lamina spiralis is wanting, it constructs the septum altogether. ScALJi: OF THE COCHLEA (fig. 249). The tube of the cochlea is ^^J^^^,* divided by the septum into two primary passages, of which one is lear tube: the scala tympani (s t), and the other scala vestibuli (s v) ; but the latter is rendered smaller by a third canal being cut off from it by membrane. These passages are placed one above another, the scala vestibuli position; (.5 v) being nearest the apex of the cochlea. Above, they communi- extent; cate through the aperture named helicotrema (/). Below, they end joined difl:erently, as the names express ;—the scala vestibuli oj)ens into above; the front of the vestibule (fig. 267, g) ; but the scala tympani is separate shut out from the vestibular cavity by the lamina spiralis of the^^^°'^' septimi cochleee, and is closed below by the meml)rane of the fenestra rotunda, though in the dry bone it opens into the tympanum. Each has certain peculiarilies. The vestibular scala extends into they difler the apex of the cochlea ; while the tympanic scala is largest near ^nd^s^ize^ the base. Connected with the last is the small aqueduct of the cochlea, which begins at an opening close to the lower end of the opening in scala, and ends at the lower border of the petrous portion of the ' temporal bone : it transmits a small vein from the cochlea. The scala? are clothed with a thin fibrous membrane, continuous lining with that in the vestibule : in the scala tympani it helps to close membrane, the fenestra rotunda, forming the inner layer of the secondary membrane of the tympanum, and ioins the fibrous process in the ftTlcl coil- aqueduct of the cochlea. The perilymph fills both scalaj. tents. Canal of the cochlea. In the upper division of the cochlear Cochlear tube a fine membrane (fig. 250, ^) extends obliquely across from the ^^^^^ upper surface of the lamina spiralis, at the inner border of the basilar limbus, to the outer wall of the cavity a little above the spiral membrane ligament. This is called the membrane of Reissner, and separates a ^"ane of' small cavity named the canal or duct of tlie cochlea (c c) from the scala Reissner; vestibuli (s v). The canal thus formed extends from apex to base of the cochlea, and contains a fluid—endolymph. Above, it reaches into the cupola and is closed. Below, it is connected by a very small tube joined by {canalis reuniens; fig. 251, c) with the saccule in the vestibule. ^I^^I^IX^' Within the canal of the cochlea, resting on the basilar membrane, is below; the complicated structure known as the organ of Corti (fig. 250), in contains which the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve end. Corti. Membranous Labyrinth (fig. 251). Lodged in the vestibule xhe mem- are two membranous sacs, the utricle and saccule, from the former |^^byrinth of which tubular offsets are continued into the semicircular canals, consists of These, together with the canal of the cochlea and the organ of Corti, saccule which have been referred to above, make up the membranous ^^^^^g'^^j^"!^'!^' labyrinth. The sacs and their prolongations are immersed in the cochlear canal

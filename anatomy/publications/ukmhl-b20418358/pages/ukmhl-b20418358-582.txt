DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. The fourth nerve (fig. 184, 4 S) sends one brai>cli upwards to the sucral i^lexus, another downwards to join the fifth nerve, and dis- tributes the following offsets to the viscera and the muscles of the floor of the pelvis :â€” The visceral branches (^) supply the bladder and the vagina, and communicate with the sympathetic nerve to form the pelvic plexus. Other offsets are added to them from the third sacral nerve (fig. 185, v). The muscular branches are three in number. One rather long ^^^^^^ i- -5 Tlie coccygeal nerve (1 c), after issuing by the lower aperture of the spinal canal, a^^pears through the coccygeus muscle, and joins the fifth sacral nerve as above stated. Sacral plexus. This plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the first three sacral nerves, and part of the fourth sacral. It is situate on the pyriformis muscle, beneath the sciatic and pudic branches of the internal iliac artery ; and the nerves entering it converge towards the large sacro-sciatic foramen. Here they are united for the most part in a broad flat band, which, becoming * Dissection of the sacral nerves and plexus (altered from Henle). a. Urinary bladder, h. Rectum, c. Levator ani. d.

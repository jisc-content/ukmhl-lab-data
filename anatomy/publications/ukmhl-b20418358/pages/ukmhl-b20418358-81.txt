SCALENE MUSCLES. 67 the clavicle and the clavicular part of the stern o-mastoid : the phrenic nerve lies along its anterior surface, and the subclavian vein with vessels, crosses over it near the rib. Along the inner border is the internal jugular vein. Beneath it are the pleura, the subclavian artery, and and nerves; the nerves of the brachial plexus. The attachment to the vertebrae Fig. 17.* corresponds with the origin of the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Action. The anterior muscle raises strongly the first rib, in con- use. sequence of its forward attachment. If the rib is fixed, it bends forwards the lower part of the neck.

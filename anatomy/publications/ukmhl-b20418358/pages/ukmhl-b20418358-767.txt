753 AUDITORY NERVE. minute structure of the be made to a work on Fi"-. 252. membranous microscopic The dudns endolynqjhaticits is a fine tubular offset of the mem- Endo- branous labyrinth, which occupies the aqueduct of the vestibule, dunf^^^'^ and ends in a dilated blind extremity {saccus endolymphaticus), and sac; embedded in the dura mater on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In the vestibule the duct divides it opens into into two small branches, one of which joins the saccule, and the JJScie!'^^^ other the utricle. For an account of the labyrinth, reference must anatomy. Nerve of the Labyrinth. A special nerve, the eighth cranial or auditory (p. 191), is distributed to the labyrintli. Entering the internal auditory meatus with the facial nerve (p. 147), it divides into an upper smaller, and a lower larger piece, each of which again subdivides into three branches. At the bottom of the meatus, the upper piece is marked by a gang- lionic swelling—the intiimescentia ganglioformis of Scarpa. The iqjper division of the nerve sends its branches to the macula of the utricle (fig. 252, c), to the ampulla of the superior vertical semicircular canal, and to the ampulla of the external semi- circular canal. From the loiver division of the nerve proceed an offset to the lower gives saccule («) and a slender branch to the ampulla of the posterior saccule, vertical semicirclilar canal (5) ; but the greater part is destined for ^"^^^"^nd the cochlea. cochlea ; Each of the branches of the auditory nerve breaks up into a ending of v6stioul<ir bundle of filaments, which pass through minute apertures of the branches; lamina cribrosa, to reach their special part of the membranous labyrinth. The nerves of the semicircular canals enter the ampullae on their outer flattened side, and end in the crista acustica ; while those of the sacs end in the respective maculae. The cochlear nerves traverse the canals of the modiolus, and bend ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ outwards in the passages of the lamina spiralis (fig. 250,"). As they spiral enter the latter, they join a ganglion (ganglion spirale) which occu- g^^ngiion, pies a winding canal at the junction of the lamina spiralis with the modiolus ; and from this they are continued as fine branches, form- ^^^f. ™' , . . organ oi ing a close plexus, to the organ of Corti.

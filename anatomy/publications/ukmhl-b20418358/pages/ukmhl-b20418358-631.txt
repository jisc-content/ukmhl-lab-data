SCARPA'S TRIANGULAR SPACE. 617 lying slightly outside the centre of the space, and supplies small femoral cutaneous offsets, as well as a large deep branch, the jjrofunda : a ^^^^^^' small offset (external pudic) is directed from it to the scrotum across the inner boundary. On the inner side of the artery and close to it is placed the femoral vein, which is here joined by the saphenous of vein; and profunda branches. About a third of an inch external to the of anterior vessel is situate the large anterior crural nerve, which lies deeply at crural nerve, first between the iliacus and psoas, but afterwards becomes more superficial and divides into branches. Deep lymphatics accompany the femoral vessels, and are continued Lymphatics Fig. 201.* into the iliac glands in the abdomen ; they are joined by the super- ficial lymphatics. Femoral artery (fig. 203). This vessel is a continuation of the Femoral arteiy: * Dissection of Scarpa's triangular s^jace (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: a. Sartorius. b, Iliacus. c.

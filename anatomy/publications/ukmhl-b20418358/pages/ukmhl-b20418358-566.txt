After surround- partly the ing the upper portion of the rectum, and forming a fold (meso- ' â„¢' rectum) behind it, the membrane covers the upper surface of the bladder, and j)i'ojects for some way between the two viscera, thus giving rise to the recto-vesical pouch (fig. 156, rvjj) : on each Fig. 181.* side of the pouch the serous membrane is raised into a ridge or and partly slight fold by the obliterated hypogastric artery. From the summit the bladder, and sides of the bladder it is reflected to the wall of the pelvis and leaving front abdomen. All the front and lower part of the bladder are therefore uncovered by peritoneum ; and when the bladder is distended it rises above the pubic bones, so as to allow of its being opened in front without injury to the serous membrane. The recto-vesical pouch is wide above, where it corresponds with the interval between the iliac arteries, and is narrow below between the rectum and bladder. It descends slightly into the interval between the vesiculse seminales, and ends usually at a line joining the spots where the ureters enter the wall of the bladder. The extent downwards of the pouch varies greatly with the condition of and lower part free, Pouch be- tween the rectum and bladder: extent and distance from anus vary. * Side view of the dissected male pelvis, a.

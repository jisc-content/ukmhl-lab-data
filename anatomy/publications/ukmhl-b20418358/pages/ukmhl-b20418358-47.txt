33 APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. lower lid. The apertures of the glands open in a line at the free border of the lid near the posterior edge. Each gland is a small yellowish tube, closed at one end, and their having minute lateral ctecal appendages connected with it. The secretion is similar to that of the sebaceous glands of the skin. If the palpebral fascia be cut through in the upper lid, the tendon Tendon of of the levator palpehrce will be seen to be inserted into the fore part of paipebrse. the tarsus hj a wide aponeurotic expansion. The conjunctiva, or mucous membrane, lines the interior of the Mucous lids, from which it is reflected to tlie front of the eyeball. The line '"^^"^ of reflection is known as the fornix conjiinctivcc, and is placed, above and below, some distance beyond the convex margin of the tarsus. Inside the lids the conjunctiva is inseparably nnited to the tarsi, and has numerous fine papillae. At the free margin of the lids it joins the skin, and through the lachrymal canals and nasal duct it is con- tinuous with the pituitary membrane of the nose. Between the eyeball and the inner commissure of the lids is seen Caruncle a prominent and fleshy-looking body—carnncula lachrymalis (fig. 14, '^), which contains a group of glands, and has a few minute hairs on its surface. External to the caruncle is a small vertical fold of and con- the mucous membrane—^j^/tca semilunaris, resting on the inner part ^'S^ous fold, of the eyeball. Blood-vessels of the eyelids. The arteries of the eyelids are Arteries of furnished b}^ the palpebral and lachrymal branches of the opli- ^^'^^' thalmic artery :— The jjft^j9e6raZ arteries, one for each eyelid, run outwards from palpebral the inner canthus, lying between the tarsal -plate and the orbicular jnuscle, and anastomose externally with the lachrymal artery. From each arch branches are distributed to the structures of the lid. The terminal portion of the lachrymal artery perforates the and lachry- palpebral fascia at the outer part of the orbit, and, after having given small offsets to the upper eyelid, divides into two branches which complete the palpebral arches. The veins of the lids open into the angular, facial and temporal Veins, veins. The nerves of the eyelids are supplied from the ophthalmic and f^^^^'^^ superior maxillary divisions of the fifth and tlie facial nerves. The branches of the ophthalmic nerve which give offsets to the from fifth, U2323er lid are the following : lachrymal, at the outer part; supra- orbital, about the middle ; and supratrochlear and infratrochlear at the inner side. In the lower eyelid there are usually two palpebral branches, inner and outer, of tlie superior maxillary nerve. Branches of the facial nerve enter both lids at the outer side, and ^""^^ seventh supply the orbicularis muscle; they communicate with the offsets of the fifth nerve. External Ear. The outer ear consists of a broad, projecting ^^^^^^^^^^J or auricle, and of a tube—meatus auditorius inwards to the middle ear, from which it is separated by the tympanic membrane. The pinna may be now examined on the left side of the head; the meatus will be described with the anatomy of the ear. D

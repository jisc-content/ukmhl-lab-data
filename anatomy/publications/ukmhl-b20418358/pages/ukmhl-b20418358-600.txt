DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 580 parts as a whole. Only the clitoris remains to be examined now, the others having been seen in the dissection of the perineum (p. 438) ; but there is also an erectile body on each side of the entrance to the vagina, called the bulb of the vestibule, to be noticed. Clitoris: iJissection. To see the clitoris, the integuments forming the to^see^tT ^i^terior commissure must be removed; and, after the body of the organ has been laid bare, the crura, one on each side, are to be followed outwards. is like the The CLITORIS (fig. 192, h) is a small erectile body, and is the penis; rejjresentative of the penis. It has the same composition as the Fig. 192.* lias a glans and pre- puce ; composi- tion, corpora cavernosa, corpus .spoiiyiu- suni, and erectile tissue. penis, except that the urethra is not continued along it. Its anterior extremity is terminated by a rounded part or glans (c), and is covered by a fold of the mucous membrane corresponding to the prepuce of the male (p. 438). In its structure this organ resembles the penis in the following particulars :â€”It consists of corpora cavernosa, which are attached by crura (one on each side ; a) to the ischio-pubic rami, and are blended in the body. A small suspensory ligament descends to it from the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris; and along the middle is an imperfect pectiniform septum. Farther, it possesses a portion of corpus sjDongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans clitoridis (c). Structure. The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that in the male organ (p. 582).

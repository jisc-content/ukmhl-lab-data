DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. 90 the internal maxillary artery and the pterygoid muscles. Into it the veins corresponding to the branches of the artery empty them- tributaries, selves, and it communicates with the cavernous sinus in the interior of the skull through the foramen ovale and foramen lacerum. From the plexus the large internal maxillary vein leads backwards, and outlets, and another considerable branch, the anterior internal maxillary or deep facial vein, descends to the face to join the facial vein. A prolongation of the plexus into the sphenp-maxillary fossa is often distinguished as the alveolar flexus. Inferior The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE (fig. 23) is the largest of the maxillary nerve.. Fig. 23.* \ three trunks arising from the Gasserian ganglion (p. 18). It leaves the skull by the foramen ovale in the sphenoid bone, and divides immediately below that opening into two principal pieces, viz., an anterior smaller part, which is distributed mainly to muscles, and a larger posterior part, ending in branches which are, with one exception, altogether sensory. In addition to these, the nerve of the internal pterygoid muscle arises from the inner side of the primary trunk. Directions. Should the internal maxillary artery obstruct the view of the nerve, it may be cut through. *" Deep view of the pterygoid region (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: A. Temporal reflected, b.

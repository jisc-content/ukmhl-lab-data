POPLITEAL ARTERY AND BRANCHES. 653 As far as the ham the vessel is inclined obliquely from the inner The part in side of the limb to the interval between the condyles of the femur, " and is then directed along the middle of the space over the knee- course and joint. The artery is overlain by the belly of the semimembranosus ^"^^^^^'"^"'^' muscle to within an inch of the internal condyle ; but thence onwards it is situate between the lieads of tlie gastrocnemius, and is covered only by the fascia lata and the integuments. Beneath it is the femur, with the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. In contact with the vessel, and somewhat on the outer side at lirst, lies the popliteal vein, so that on looking into the space, the ' arterial trunk is almost covered ; but in the interval between the heads of the gastrocnemius, the vein and its branches altogether conceal the artery. In the lower part of the ham the short saphen- ous vein (fig. 210, i) and the muscular branches of the artery are also superficial to the popliteal trunk. More superficial than the large vessels, and slightly external to and of the them in position, is placed the internal popliteal nerve, which, with its branches, lies over the artery, like the vein, between the heads of the gastrocnemius. In the bottom of the hollow the small obturator nerve runs on the artery to the joint. Dissection. To see the deep part of the artery, the inner head of Cut inner the gastrocnemius should be cut through and raised. On removing gastrocne- the areolar tissue the vessels and nerves vnll appear. The lower articular branches of the vessels and nerve are now brought into view ;—the inner artery is below the head of the tibia, and the outer, higher up, between the femur and tibia, each with a vein ; and the first has a companion nerve. Beyond the ham. While the artery is beneath tlie (jastrocneiaius ^^^'^^'^y'^^^- (fig. 215) it sinks deeply into the limb ; here it is crossed by a small '^""^ ' muscle—the plantaris (c), and the ending is concealed by the soleus (b). It rests on the popliteus muscle. Botli the companion vein and the internal popliteal nerve change position of their position to the artery, and gradually cross over it, so as to iierve""^ lie on its inner side at the lower border of the popliteus. Sometimes the artery is divided as high as the back of the knee-joint ; and ^^^^ then the anterior tibial artei-y may lie beneath the popliteus muscle. li vision. Branches (fig. 210) are furnished by the artery to the surround- ^^^^^^!^}^^'^ ing muscles, to the integuments, and to the articulation;—those that belong to the joint are five in number, and are called articular, viz., two superior, inner and outer; two inferior, also inner and outer ; and a central or azygos branch. a. The muscular branches are upper and lower. The uj^per set, Muscular three or four in number, arise above the knee, and end in the semi- membranosus and biceps muscles, communicating with the perforat- ing and muscular branches of the profunda. The lower set (sural) are furnished to the muscles of the calf, viz., gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. b. The cutaneous or superficial sural branches descend to the skin and cuta-

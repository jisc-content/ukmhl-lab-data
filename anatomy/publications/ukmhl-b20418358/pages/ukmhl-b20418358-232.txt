DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 218 Body; Tlie hody is beneath the parietal lobe of the hemisphere, and extends from the foramen of Monro to the sj)lenium of the corpus callosum. It is somewhat arched, with the convexity upwards, and in its floor are seen the following j)arts, proceeding from without objects ill inwards :—1, the hinder portion of a pyriform mass of grey matter ' named the corpus striatum (caudate nucleus ; e), 2, a slender white Fig. 70.* band—the taenia semicircularis (/), 3, a narrow part of the optic thalamus {g), 4, a vascular fringe of the pia mater—the choroid plexus Qi), and 5, a thin white layer—the lateral part of the fornix (c). It is bounded internally for a short distance in front by the mesial limit, hinder part of the septum lucidum (6), and behind this by the meeting of the fornix and corpus callosum. Anterior The anterior cornu j)rojects forwards, with an inclination down- lioru: wards and outwards, into the frontal lobe.

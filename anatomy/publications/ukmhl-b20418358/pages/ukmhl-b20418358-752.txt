DISSECTION OF THE EAR. 738 contains tlie facial nerve. Lastly, in front of this ridge, and close to the roof of the fore part of the cavity, is the ending of the canal and canal of for the tensor tympani muscle (ctt). The canal is separated from tympani. ^^^^ Eustachian tube (e^) below it by a thin plate of bone named the cochleariform process; this becomes expanded on reaching the tympanic cavity, and being bent upwards, prolongs the canal beyond the end of the Eustachian tube. In most cases the outer wall of the tympanic portion of the canal is partly formed by fibrous tissue. The aperture by which the tendon of the muscle escapes is placed a little above and in front of the fenestra ovalis. On outer The outer houndary of the cavity is formed by the membrana nTeKaJraua* tympani (fig. 241, c), and the surrounding bone. Above and in tympani and front of the membrane, is the upper opening of the Glaserian fissure, fissure!^^ which is occupied in the fresh condition by the long process of one of the small bones (malleus) and some fibres of its anterior ligament, and by the anterior tympanic vessels.

231 AQUEDUCT OF SYLVIUS. Avitli its base turned forwards in the groove between the superior (|uadrigeminal bodies. It is surrounded by pia mater ; and its base is attached by a hollow white stalk, below to the posterior commis- sure, and above to the optic thalamus on each side, along which it sends forwards the thin band already described as the pineal stria (/; p. 228). Thin body is of a red colour and very vascular. It is not structure, composed of nervous substance, but consists of small follicles lined by epithelium, and containing minute granular masses of calcareous matter (brain-sand) : similar concretions are often found on its surface, and adhering to its stalk. The AQUEDUCT OF Sylvius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum ; Aqueduct of Sylvius. Fig. 77.* fig. 69) is a narrow passage, about five-eighths of an inch long, uniting the third and fourth ventricles. It is lined by ependyma, external to which is a layer of grey matter (fig. 75) continuous with that of the floor of the two cavities. Fibres of the Cerebrum. In the cerebral hemisplieres three Three sets systems of fibres are distinguished, viz., ascending, transverse, and cg^e^J^? longitudinal. The ascending are derived in large pait from the hemisphere spinal cord and the lower jDortions of the encephalon ; the transverse and longitudinal connect together parts of the cerebrum.

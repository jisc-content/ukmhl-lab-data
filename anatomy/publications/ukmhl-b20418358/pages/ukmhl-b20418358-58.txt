DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 4:4. the face" artery, the nei've appears in the cranium at the outer margin of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Finally, it enters the nasal cavity by an aperture at the front of the cribriform plate ; and after passing behind the nasal bone, it issues between that bone and the cartilage, to end on the outer side of the nose. In the orbit. In the orMt the nasal crosses over the optic nerve, but beneath the superior rectus and levator palpebrse muscles, and lies afterwards below the superior oblique ; in this part of its course it furnishes the following branches:— Branches. The branch to the lenticular ganglion (^) is about half an inch long Long root of and very slender, and arises as soon as the nerve comes into the ganglion. orbit: this is the long root of the lenticular ganglion. Longciiiaiy Long ciliary nerves. As the nasal crosses the optic nerve, it branches. * Second [view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:— A. Superior oblique, b. Levator palpebrte and upper rectus thrown back to- gether, c. External rectus, d. Fore part of upper rectus, f. Lachrymal gland. Nerves:—1. NasaL 2, Its infratrochlear branch. 3.

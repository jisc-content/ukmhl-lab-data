DISSECTION OF THE I'ELYIS 560 position and The axis of tlie uterus may be said to correspond generally with vary/ ^ ^^^^ of the inlet of the pelvis ; but the position of the organ is sub- ject to considerable variation, and is especially influenced by the state of the bladder. The fundus is commonly directed forwards, and the anterior surface rests against the bladder ; but sometimes the organ is more upright, or even inclined backwards, and then the small intestine descends into the vesico-uterine pouch, relations of The anterior surface, somewhat flattened, is covered by peritoneum, except in the lower fourth where it is in contact with the bladder. The 'poderior surface, rounded, is invested altogether by the serous membrane. extremities The wpi^er end oi f undus is the largest part of the organ, and is in contact with the small intestine. The lower end or nech (cervix) is received into the vagina. and side. To each Side are attached the broad ligament with the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, and the ovary. Round The round or suspensory ligament (n) is a fibrous cord about five ligament. inches long, which is directed forwards and outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and then through the inguinal canal to end in the groin. This cord lies over the obliterated hypogastric, and the ex- ternal iliac artery ; and it is surrounded by the peritoneum, which accompanies it a short way into the canal. * Side view of the female pelvis.

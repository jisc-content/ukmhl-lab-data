INTEEIOR OF CEREBRUM. 215 hemisj^here ends in a projecting notclied niiirgin, A\'liicli is named Dentate fascia dentata or dentate convolution (fd). Tliis will Ije l^etter seen sy^us. subsequently (p. 221). Structure of the convolutions. Each convolution is continuous Form and with the general mass of the hemisphere on the one side (base), conToiu- and is free on the other, where it presents a summit and lateral ^'^'^^^» surfaces, which are covered by pia mater. A cross section will show g^-ey its constitution of a layer of cortical grey substance on the surface, cortical, which is continued at the bottom of the sulci from one eminence to another, and a white medullary part in the centre, which appears as and white a process of the large medullary mass forming the greater part of the pa^s^^^^'^ substance of the hemisphere. On examining closely the section of a convolution in a fresh specimen, the cortex may generally be seen to pusedof'^ix consist of three grey, and as many thinner white, layers arranged l^^^f^^'^ alternately, the outermost being a thin white stratum, Avhicli is grey sui.- most marked over the fore part of the imcinate convolution. nateiy Interior of the Cerebrum. Each cerebral hemisphere consists outline of of white and grey substance, the white forming the larger portion cerebrum: of the mass (medullary centre of the hemisphere), while the grey medullary matter is chiefly disposed in a superficial layer (cortex) which covers <^^^*^®' the medullary centre, except over the region on the inner side whence cortical the corpus callosum issues ; but at the lower part of the hemisphere there are other collections of grey matter more or less surrounded by and central the medullary substance. In each hemisphere is an elongated ^^^^ masses, cavity, named the lateral ventricle, which communicates with another median space—the third ventricle, placed close to the base of the ventricles, brain. The student will now proceed to examine the parts in the interior of the hemisphere, carrying the dissection from above downwards. Dissection. Supposing both hemispheres entire, the left is to be Cut down to cut olf to the level of the calloso-marginal sulcus. When this has celftre of the been done, the-surface displays a white central mass of a semi-oval hemisphere, shape (centrum ovale minus) sending processes into the convolu- tions, and surrounded by an irregular grey margin. In a fresh brain this surface would be studded with drops of blood escaping from the divided vessels. Next, the callosal convolution is to be divided about the middle. Reflect 11 • -11 TIP 1 r\ callosal con* and the two pieces are to be thrown backwards and lorwards. (Jn volution, its under surface w^ill be seen a thin band of Avhite fibres, the cingu- ciugulum. liim or covered hand of Reil, which bends down before and behind the corpus callosum. A similar dissection is to be carried out on the opposite side ; and Repeat dis- tlie hemisphere being removed to the level of the corpus callosum, rf|ht°side! the transverse fibres of that body are to be defined as they radiate to the convolutions. Now a much larger white surface comes into view (centrum ovale The larger majus), and the white masses in the two hemispheres are seen to be fg^'deeper! *^ continuous, across the middle line, through the corpus callosum. The CORPUS CALLOSUM reaches from one half of the cerebrum to the corpus other, and forms the roof of the lateral -s^entricle in each hemisphere callosum:

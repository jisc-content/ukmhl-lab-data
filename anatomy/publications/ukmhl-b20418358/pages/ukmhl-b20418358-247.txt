FIBRES OF CEREBRUM. 233 Longitudinal or collateral fibres. These are connecting fibres Longitu- wliich pass from before backwards, uniting together parts of the '^^'"^^ ^^^^'^^ same hemisphere. The chief bands of this system are the follow- ing :—The fornix, tlie ttenia seniicircularis, the pineal stria, the longitudinal stria of the corpus callosum, and the cingulum. Other fibres pass in the medullary centre between adjoining and more distant convolutions, describing arches l)eneath the sulci : these are known as the association-fibres. The dissector may now make a transverse section of the remains Make of the left hemisphere at the fore part of the optic thalamus, Avhen lentlcui'ai'^ the form and relations of the lenticuhir nucleus and the claustrum, nucleus, Fig. 78.^^ togethei- with the position of the anterior commissure will be appa- rent (fig. 74). Cuts may al«o be made into the geniculate bodies to sliow the geniculate grey nuclei within them. Finally, by dividing transversely the left half of the midbrain and mesen- througli the superior (piadrigeminal body, there will be seen the grey matter of that eminence, the crusta and tegmentum separated by the substantia nigra, tlie red nucleus of the tegmentum, and the grey matter of the Sylvian a(|ueduct (fig. 78).

Beneath the skin is the superficial fat, containing very line offsets of the superficial cervical nerve. To define the platysma muscle, remove the fat which covers it, to show carrying the knife down and back in the direction of the fleshy P^^*^®"^^- fibres. Platysma myoides. The anterior part of the platysma, viz., Anterior from the sterno-mastoid muscle to the lower jaw, covers the greater piatysma: portion of the anterior triangular space. At the base of the jaw it insertion is inserted between the symphysis and the masseter muscle ; while into jaw. other and more posterior fibres are continued over the face, joining the depressor anguli oris and risorius, as far as the fascia covering the parotid gland, or even to the cheek-bone. The fibres have the same appearance in this as in the posterior ^j[g^^^^|g"^ half of the muscle (p. 53), but they are rather stronger. Below the chin the inner fibres of opposite muscles frequently cross for a short distance, but those which are superficial do not always belong to the same side in different bodies. Action. The hinder part of this muscle draws the corner of the Use on mouth downwards and outwards ; the fore part is used in swallow- "^"^^^^^ ing, and carries forwards the skin of the upper part of the neck, thus Hig^.^^ facilitating the upward movement of the larynx. When the muscle contracts forcibly, the skin of the upper part of the chest and shoulder is also raised. Dissection. Eaise the platysma to the base of the jaw, and dissect Dissection, out beneath it the branches of the superficial cervical nerve, and the cervical branch of the facial nerve. Clean also the deep fascia of the neck, and the anterior jugular vein which is placed near the middle line. The SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL NERVE has been traced from its ^^Pf^^^f^^^ origin in the cervical plexus to its position on the deej) fascia of the nerve; neck (p. 57). - Beneath the platysma it divides into an upper and a lower branch :— The upper branch perforates the platysma, and ends in the skin ascending, over the anterior triangle, extending about half way down the neck. While beneath the platysma this branch joins the facial nerve. The loiver branch likewise passes through the platysma, and is descending distributed to the integuments below the preceding, reaching as low as the sternum. The INFRAMAXILLARY BRANCH OF THE FACIAL NERVE (p. 39) Branch of f^ciRi ncrvG pierces the deep cervical fascia, and divides into slender offsets to the neck, which pass forwards beneath the platysma, and form arches across the side of the neck (fig. 10), reaching as low as the hyoid bone. Most of the branches end in the platysma, but a few filaments perforate it, and reach the integuments. Beneath the muscle there is a communication between this branch of the facial and the upper division of the superficial cervical nerve. Dissection. Cut across the external jugular vein about the middle, Dissection, and throw the ends up and down. Afterwards the superficial nerves of the front of the neck may be divided in a line with the

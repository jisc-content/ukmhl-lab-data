BEANCHES OF OTIC GANGLION. 149 lies the large meningeal artery. In this ganglion, as in the others Structure, connected with the fifth nerve, filaments from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves are blended. Some twigs are furnished hy it to mnscles. Connectiiuj brandies—roots. Through its connection with the Brandies nerve to the internal pterygoid, the otic ganglion receives fibres from jitth,^* both the small and large roots of the inferior maxillary nerve, so that it may be said to derive its motor and sensory roots from the fifth. Its sympathetic root comes from the j^lexus on the middle meningeal artery. The ganglion is farther joined behind by the ' ' «mall superficial petrosal nerve (-), through which fibres are conveyed seventh, to it from the facial and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. One or two "inth, short branches pass between the ganglion and the beginning of the auricuio- ixuriculo-temporal nerve ; and a filament descends to the chorda and chorda tympani. tyrapani. Branches to muscles. Two muscles receive their nerves through Branches to the otic ganglion, viz., tensor tympani and tensor palati. The nerve tensoi^^' to the tensor tympani (^) is directed backwards to gain the bony ^^^^^^Jj^^^^^^ canal lodging the muscle. The branch for the tensor iKilati (") arises palati. from the front of the ganglion, and enters the outer surface of its muscle. The fibres of these branches are derived mainly from the internal pterygoid nerve. The nerve of the internal ])terij(joid muscle (^) arises from the inner Nerve of side of the inferior maxillary nerve near the skull, and penetrates ptexj^o^d. the deep surface of the muscle. This nerve is formed almost entirely by an oft set from the motor root of the fifth. Directions. The remainder of the pteiygo-maxillary I'egion of the Directions, left side may Ije now examined. Section XV. DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. Directions. The tongue and larynx are to remain connected with Directions, each other while the student learns the general form and structure of the tongue. Dissection. The ends of the extrinsic lingual muscles that have Dissection. l)een detached on the right side may be shortened, but enough of each should be left to trace it afterwards into the substance of the tongue. The TONGUE is an ovoid, somewhat flattened body, with the Tongue: larger end turned backwards, which occupies the floor of the mouth, form and and forms a part of the anterior wall of the x^harynx. It is free "^^^''^^lo" > over the greater part of its surface ; but at the back, and at the posterior tAvo-thirds of the under surface, it is attached by muscles and mucous membrane to the parts around.

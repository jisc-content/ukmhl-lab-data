DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 192 restiform pair, Willis) has a surface attacliment outside the foregoing to the l>ody. restiform body, and to the floor of the fourth ventricle. Deep origin Deep 07'iylit. At its attacliinent to the medulla oblongata the auditory from^nner^^ nerve consists of two roots, upper and lower. The fibres of the up2')er root amrouter^ run backwards through the lowest part of the pons to the outer auditory auditory nucleus beneath the lateral angle of the fourth ventricle (fig. 63), and some nuclei. fibres are said to pass outwards to the cerebellum. The lower root is partly connected with the inner auditory nucleus, beneath the auditory tubercle in the floor of the fourth ventricle, by means of fibres passing backwards on the inner side of the restiform body ; and another part is continued superficially round the outer side of the restiform body to the floor of the fourth ventricle, where it gives rise to the auditory strife, but the central connection of these fibres is uncertain. Ninth nerve The NINTH Or GLOSSO-PHARYNGE.\L NERVE (first trunk of the below facial: gjghtli j^air, Willis) leaves the medulla oblongata by fi\Q or six fila- ments close below the facial nerve, in the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies. nucleus in Deep origin. Directed backwards through the medulla oblongata, the floor of fibres join a nucleus beneath the inferior fovea in the floor of the fourth ^""^V, ventricle, ventricle. Tenth nerve The TENTH, VA(4U8 or PNEl irO-GASTRIC NERVE (second trunk of telowninth: ^j^^ eighth pair, Willis r^) issues by a number of filaments (twelve to fifteen) from the medulla oblongata in a line with, and below the gl osso-pharyngeal. nucleus beneath fourth ventricle. Deep origin. Taking <i similar course in the medulla oblongata to the roots of the ninth nerve, the fibres of the vagus reach their nucleus in the calamus scriptorius of the fourth ventricle. Eleventh nerve in two piei;es; accessory from medulla oblongata, spinal from cord. The ELEVENTH or SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE (third trunk of the eighth pair, Willis) consists of two partsâ€”accessory to the vagus, and spinal. The accessory or bnlhar part is of small size, and is formed by the union of slender filaments continuing the line of the glosso-pharyn- geal and vagus nerves along the medulla oblongata, as low as the first cervical nerve. After communicating with the spinal part in the jugular foramen, it throws itself into the vagus ner\'e outside the skull (p. 112). The spinal part is firm and round, like the third or the sixth nerve, but only a small piece of it can now be seen. It arises by a number of fine filaments from the lateral column of the spinal cord as low as the sixth cervical nerve. As the nerve ascends along the side of the cord it lies between the ligamentum denticulatiun and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, with the upper of which it may be connected ; and it enters the skull by the foramen magnum. Both from Deep origin. The fibres of both accessory and spinal parts have been one nucleus, traced inwards to an elongated column of cells i-eaching from the lower third of the olivary body to the level of the fifth cervical nerve, and situate in the spinal part of its extent in the outer pai't of the anterior horn of the grey

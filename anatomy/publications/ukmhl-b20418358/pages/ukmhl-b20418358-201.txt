CIECLE OF WILLIS. 187 b. The anterior cerebral artery (") supplies tlie inner part of the Anterior cerebral hemisphere. It is directed forwards to the median fissure artery^^ between the halves of the large brain ; and as it is about to enter, it is united to its fellow by a short thick branch—the o??imo?-com- communicating Q). Then passing into the fissure, it bends round °' the fore part of the cor]3Us callosum, and is continued backwards along the upper surface of that body, sending its branches nearly to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere. It is distributed as follows :— Two or three small offsets {central branches) arise near the begin- central, ning of the artery, and penetrate the anterior perforated space at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius to reach the fore part of the corpus striatum in the interior of the hemisphere. The cortical branches sujiply the fore and upper parts of the ^'^1;!^^?'^*''^^^^ internal surface of the hemisphere, extending backwards as far as the parieto-occijDital fissure ; and some turn round the margin to the adjacent portions of the frontal lobe on both the upper and lower aspects. c. The middle cerebral artery ("') is the largest branch of the ^'^^^J.^^ carotid, and ramifies over the outer surface of the hendspliere. artery: Entering the fissure of Sylvius, it divides into four or five large cortical branches, which issue from the outer side of that groove, cortica and supply the whole of the parietal lobe, together Avitli the neigh- bouring parts of the frontal and teinporo-sphenoidal lobes. A set of small central branches arises from the artery at its origin, ^""^jj^j'gg'^^^' and j)asses through the anterior j^erforated space to the grey matter of the corpus striatum. d. The choroid arterii (anterior ; ^) is small and arises either from choroid . artery. the trunk of the carotid, or from the middle cerebral artery : it passes backwards on the outer side of the posterior communicating artery, and makes its way between the hemisphere and the cms cerebri to the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. Circle of Willis. The arteries at the under part of the brain are ^^[j'^jg ?^ united freely both on their own side and across the middle line in an anastomotic ring—the circle of Willis. On each side this ring is formed by the trunk of the internal carotid giving forwards the vessels that anterior cerebral, and backwards the posterior conmiunicating artery. "^^"^ ^ ' In front it is constructed by the converging anterior cerebrals, and the anterior communicating artery. And behind is the bifurcation of the basilar trunk into the posterior cerebrals. In the area of the circle lie several bodies corresponding with the floor of the third ventricle. The com]3lete inosculation between the cranial vessels in the Use of the circle of Willis allows at all times a free circulation of blood through oSation. the brain, even though a large vessel on one side of the neck should be obstructed. Bevond the circle of Willis the arteries of the cerebrum communi- other , -.If. anastomoses cate together only by fine anastomoses. are small. The VEINS of the brain enter the sinuses of the dura mater, and veins of tiie do not form companion trunks to the arteries.

385 MOVEMENTS OF SPINE. In the neck the place of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments is taken hy the ligamentum nuchse (p. 390). Ligaments of the transverse processes. In the loins the inter- Inter- transverse ligaments are thin membranous bands in the intervals ij^^ments^ between the processes. In the dorsal region there are rounded fibrous bundles (fig. 129,"^) passing between the extremities of the transverse processes of the middle vertebrae, and representing the intertransverse muscles of the low^er spaces. In the neck they are absent. Ligaments of Special Vertebra. The description of the Ligaments ligaments of the first two cervical, and of the sacral and coccygeal vertebra! vertebrai, will be found with the dissection of the neck (p. 175) and of the pelvis (p. 595). Movements of Spinal Column. The spinal column can be Kinds of bent forwards, backwards, and to each side ; and it can be rotated. ^ ^' In flsxion the vertebrae between the axis and sacrum are inclined Flexion: forwards. The greatest movement takes place between the lower lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum ; there is an intermediate degree desree; in the neck ; and the least is in the upper half of the dorsal region, where the ribs are united to the sternum. The bodies of the bones are brought nearer together in front, movement while they are separated behind. The inferior pair of articular ^^^^^' processes of the second vertebra glide upwards on the upper of the third ; the inferior processes of the third bone move in like manner on the upper of the fourth ; and so on throughout the moveable column. The ligament in front of the bodies is relaxed, but the posterior, j'jg^^^g^^g and those uniting the neural arches and processes are tightened. The fore part of each intervertebral disc is compressed, and the back is stretched. In extension the column is arched backw^ards. The motion is Extension: most in the neck, and least in the dorsal vertebra^, which are fixed "l^ere most, by the true ribs and the sternum, and are impeded in their move- -"^"'^ ^^^^^ '■> ment b}" the overlapping spinous processes. The posterior parts of the vertebrae are approximated, while the "j.^^'^^"^^*^ anterior are separated ; and the inferior articular processes of each glide downwards on the upper ones of the next succeeding bone. The condition of the ligaments is the opposite to that in flexion. ^j^j^JJ^^^^g Thus, the intervertebral discs are compressed behind, and stretched in front ; the spinous and yellow ligaments are relaxed; the anterior common liga72?.ent of the bodies is tightened, and the hinder band is slackened. Lateral inclination. The spine can be curved to the right or the Beiidingto left side. Like the last movement, this bend is least in the more ^^^^^"^^. fixed upper dorsal vertebrae, and is greatest in the neck. On the concave side of the curve, say the right, the bodies are movement ' ^ „ of bones; brought nearer together ; and they are carried away from each other on the opposite aspect. The right inferior articular surface glides down, and the left up, in the joints wdth the vertebra beneath. On the right side the ligaments will be relaxed and the inter- ifg^,^,gQt^

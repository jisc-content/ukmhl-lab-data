RELATIONS OF THE PROSTATE. 555 contact with tlie pubic bones and anterior true ligaments, as well as with the abdominal wall if the bladder is very full, and is altogether free from peritoneum. The superior or abdominal surface is entirely superior covered by the serous membrane, and has the small intestine and sigmoid Hexure resting on it : the vas deferens courses over the hinder part of this surface beneath the peritoneum. Extending along the upper part of each lateral region is the and lateral, obliterated hypogastric artery, which marks the extent of the peri- toneal covering at the side. The surface below this is connected with the pelvic fascia by very loose areolar tissue. The nech (cervix) is the j)art of the bladder near the urethra, and Neck, is surrounded by the prostate gland. This is the lowest part of the organ. When the bladder is empty, the upper wall falls upon the lower ; gj*^p^y" the apex lies at the upper end of the pubic symphysis ; and the base bladder, is of very small extent and looks downwards. In a median section the cavity then appears as a slit, which is continued backwards for a short distance beyond the beginning of the urethra. The URETER (fig. 181, h) crosses the common or the external iliac ^Jj^lfg^^'^ artery, and inclines forwards below the level of the obliterated hypo- gastric artery, being covered by the peritoneum constituting the posterior false ligament of the bladder. It enters the bladder at the enters upper and outer part of the base, at the distance of one inch and a half or two inches from the jDrostate gland. The PROSTATE GLAND (fig, 181, h) surrouuds the neck of the Prostate: bladder. Its shape is conical with the base turned upwards, and position; its size about equals that of a large chestnut. In the present â€¢ position of the pelvis, a line from the apex through the middle of '"^^^^' the gland would be directed obliquely backwards and slightly down- wards towards the sacrum ; but in the erect state of the body the axis is nearly vertical. The anterior surface is about three-quarters of an inch from the '^^ symphysis pubis, to which it is attached by the anterior true liga- surface, ments of the Bladder. On this surface the dorsal vein of the penis divides to enter the prostatic plexus. The posterior surface has the greatest extent, and is close to the rectum ; this is the part that is felt by the finger introduced into the bowel through the anus.

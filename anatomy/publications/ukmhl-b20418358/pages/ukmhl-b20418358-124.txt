The terminal branches of the nerve supply the hinder part of the tongue, in connection with which they are described (Section XV). Vagus non e The PXEUMO-GASTRic or VAGUS NERVE (fig. 28, ^) is the largest of the cranial nerves in the neck, and escapes through the jugular foramen in the same sheath of dura mater as the spinal accessory. In the foramen it has a distinct gan- glion (gang, of the root), to which the smaller part of the spinal acces- sory nerve is connected. When the nerve has left the foramen, it receives the small part of the spinal accessory, and swells into a ganglion nearl}- an inch long (gang, of the trunk). This gan- glion lies iDetween the internal ca- rotid artery and jugular vein, and communicates with several nerves. To reach the thorax, the vagus de- scends almost vertically (fig. 27,'') between the internal jugular vein and the internal and common ca- rotid arteries ; and it enters that cavity, on the right side, by cross- ing over the subclavian arter}'-, but beneath the innominate vein.

EEAJ^CHES OF EXTERNAL CAROTID. 81 veins. in tlie occipital grove of the temporal bone, passing above the trans- verse process of the atlas, and then runs between the muscles ends on attached to the occipital bone, to become cutaneous and ramify over ' the back of the head (p. 6). In the part of its course now exposed the artery lies beneath the digastric muscle, and crosses over the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves. The occipital artery gives small branches to the surrounding a sterno- muscles, and one larger branch to the sterno-mastoid, which bends JJp^iJci^. downwards over the hypoglossal and enters the muscle in company with the spinal accessory nerve : this branch frequently arises sometimes a directly from the external carotid. In some bodies there is also a meningeal, small meningeal branch entering the skull by the jugular foramen. The offsets at the back of the neck are seen in the dissection of that region. The occipital veins are two or three in number, and pass down- Occipital wards between the muscles of the back of the neck to enter the deep cervical vein. They communicate through the mastoid foramen with the lateral sinus in the interior of the skull. Th.^posterior auricular artery is smaller than the preceding branch, Posterior and takes origin above the digastric muscle. Between the ear and the mastoid process, it divides into two branches for the ear and ■occiput (p. 6). A small branch, stylo-mastoid, enters the foramen of the same a branch to name, and supplies the middle ear. tympanum The posterior auricular vein is of considerable size, and descends Posterior over the upper end of the sterno-mastoid muscle to join the veiii?^^^^^ beginning of the external jugular. The superficial temporal artery (i) is one of the terminal Temporal branches of the external carotid, and in direction forms the con- ^^^^^^" tinuation of that trunk. Ascending in the parotid gland and over the posterior root of the zygoma, it divides on the temporal fascia into anterior and posterior branches which are distributed over the termmation front and side of the head (p. 5). Before dividing the artery gives off the following branches :— a. Parotid branches are furnished to the gland of the same name; [^^^^^^^,^^5^^ articular twigs to the articulation of the lower jaw ; and muscular to articuia- branches to the masseter. b. Some anterior auricular offsets are distributed to the pinna and and to ear; meatus of the external ear. c. The transverse facial branch leaves the temporal artery close to ^° its origin, and is directed forwards over the masseter muscle (p. 28); on the side of the face it supplies the muscles and integuments, and anastomoses with the facial artery. d. The middle temporal branch pierces the temporal aponeurosis ^Jjj^pQ^J.gJ^j^ just above the zygoma, and enters the substance of the temporal muscle muscle : it anastomoses with the temporal branches of the internal maxillary artery. e. A small orbital branch runs forwards between the layers of the ^^'^ fascia temporal fascia, and is distributed to the superficial structures near G

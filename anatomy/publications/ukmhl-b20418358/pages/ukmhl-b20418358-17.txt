OCCIPITO-FROXTALIS MUSCLE. 3 more of the upper curved line of the occipital bone, and from tlie Occipital mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The fibres are about one in^endiiTg" inch and a half in length, and ascend to the aponeurosis. The anterior or frontal ijcirt Q) forms a thin layer which covers Frontal about the lower two-thirds of the frontal bone. Its fibres are paler ^^^^' than those of the occipital part, and spring from the aponeurosis tached some distance below the line of the coronal suture. They descend Fig. 1.* to the eyebrow and root of the nose, where they interlace with the fibres of the 'orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii and pyramidalis nasi muscles, and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue. Some fasciculi are frequently attached to the nasal bone internally, and to the external angular process of the frontal bone on the outer side. The right and left muscular portions meet at the lower part of the forehead. The tendon or epicranial ajjoneurosis covers the upper part of the Aponeu- cranium, and is continuous across the middle line with the like ^"^^^^ 'â–  structure of the opposite half of the head. In front, it sends a pointed process downwards for some distance between the two muscular 23ortions; and behind, it is prolonged between the posterior attaci bellies, to be attached to the occipital bone along the highest curved ment, line. From its lateral margin the upper auricular muscles arise, and rela- tions. * ]\Iuscles of the scalp and ear. 1. Anterior, and 4, posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis. 15. Attollens aurem. 16.

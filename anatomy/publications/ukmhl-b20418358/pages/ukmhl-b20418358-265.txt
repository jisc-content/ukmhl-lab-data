THE AXILLA. 251 to open on tlie summit by apertures smaller tlian tlie canals, and open on end varying from the size of a bristle to that of a common pin. mppie. Nipple. The substance of the nipple is composed in great part ^g^^^j'^J^j^^^ of a network of interlacing bundles of plain muscular tissue, through nipple, which the lactiferous ducts pass to the surface. Some of the bundles extend from base to apex of the nipple ; and surrounding the base is a set of circular fibres, with which radiating bundles decussate. Blood-vessels.—The arteries are supplied by the axillary, internal manuiiary, Arteries of and intercostal, and enter both surfaces of the gland. The veins end prin- ^^^^ g^fmcl) cipally in the axillary and internal mammary trunks ; but others enter the and veins, intercostal veins. The nerves ai-e supplied from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of Nerves, the thorax, viz., from the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerves. The lymphatics of the inner side open into the sternal glands ; those of the Lymphatics, outer side pass to the axillary glands. Dissection (fig. 83). With the limb in the same position to the ^/p^g^ctori'i trunk, the student is first to remove the fascia and the fat from the muscle. surface of the great pectoral muscle. In cleaning the muscle the scalpel should be carried in the direction of the fibres, viz., from the arm to the thorax ; and the dissection may be begun at the lower border on the right side, but at the upper border on the left side. The fascia and the fat are to be taken from the axilla, without ^.^^OY*^ T , , . , of axilla, injury to the numerous vessels, nerves, and glands m the space. The dissection will be best executed by cleaning first the large axillary vessels at the outer part, Avhere these are about to enter the arm ; and then following their branches which are directed to the chest, viz., the long thoracic under cover of the anterior boundary, and the subscapular along the posterior boundary. With the latter vessels the middle and lower subscapular nerves are to be found, and turning backwards near the arm the circumflex artery and nerve. Some arterial twigs entering the axillary glands should also be traced out. In taking away the fascia and fat from the muscles at the back of Clean back the space, the small internal cutaneous branch of the musculo- ^ ^P^^^- spiral nerve (fig. 83, ^) should be looked for near the great vessels. The nerves of the brachial plexus are then to be defined. The Trace nerves smallest of these, which possibly may be destroyed, is the nerve of P^^^"^' Wrisberg : it lies close to the hinder edge of the axillary vein, and joins with the intercosto-humeral nerve. When cleaning the serratus muscle on the ribs, the student is to and on inner seek on its surface the posterior thoracic nerve, and to trace the posterior ofi'sets of the intercostal nerves crossing the axilla. THE AXILLA. The axilla is the hollow between the arm and the chest (fig. 83). f^^f f^j!;" ..f It is somewhat pyramidal in form, with its apex directed upwards the armpit, to the root of the neck. The space is larger near the thorax than at the arm, and its boundaries are as follows :— Boundaries. In front and behind, the space is limited by the Boundaries:

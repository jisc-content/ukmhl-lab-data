181 STEllNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. The interarticular fibro-cartilage (fig. 54, ^) will come into \'ie\v Kibi-o- by cutting the ligaments before described, and raising the clavicle, ^'^^"'^^''^se: It is ovalish in form and flattened, and is thicker at the circumference than in the centre. Its upper margin is tirnilv imited to the inner attach- end of the clavicle ; and below, it is simihirly lixed to the cartilage of the first rib. At its circumference it unites with the capsule of tlie joint. The hbro-cartilage is of considerable strength, and prevents the clavicle being displaced upwards or inwards. Two synovial sacs are present in the articulation, one on each side Two of the fibro-cartilage. The external one is prolonged outwards for a sacs!^^^^ Kshort distance below, between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib. Movements. The clavicle can be moved upwards and downwards Motion in and forwards and backwards ; but the extent of movement in each directions, direction is very limited, in consequence of the shortness of the ligaments surrounding the articulation : the forward and upward movements are freer than the opposite. In llie upward and down- ward movements, the clavicle, glides on the interarticular fibro- cartilage; and when the shoulder is depressed, the inner end of the bone is raised, Avhile elevation of the shoulder is accompanied by a sinking of the inner end of the clavicle. In the forward and backward movements, the fibro-cartilage glides in the same direction over the sternal articular surface. Dislocation may take place in any direction, except downwards ; but it is of rare occurrence owing to the strength of the liiiaments.

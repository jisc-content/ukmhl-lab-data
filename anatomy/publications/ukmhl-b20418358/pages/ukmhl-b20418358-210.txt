]96 DISSECTIO?^ OF THE ERAIN. Superllcial arciform fibres. Internal structure of medulla oblongata. On tlie anterior surface of the medulla oblongata tliere may be seen, more or less distinctly in different subjects, a set of fibres crossing transversely over the upper half of the pyramid and the olivary body. These are the superficial arciform fibres, and they pass external!}' into the restiform body. Structure. The fibres of the several columns of the spinal cord enter the medulla oblongata below, where they undergo a partial re-arrangement, and are partly continued onwards to the cerebrum and cerel^ellum, being joined by other fibres which take their origin in the Imlb, and partly end in the grey substance of the medulla oblongata. The course of the fibres can only be shown to a very small extent by dissection, and for the complete study of the Fig. 59.- arrangement of the fibres, as well as of the grey matter, it is necessary to examine sections of different parts of the medulla oblongata. Dissection Dissection. To expose the connection of the pyramid with the pyramid. spinal cord, let the student turn outwards on the left side, as in fig. 59, the small part of the anterior column of the cord that remains below the decussation (for the cord has been cut through near this), and the pyramid of the right side will then be seen to divide below into two parts, one passing directly into the anterior column, and the other crossing the median fissure and disajjpearing in the opposite half of the cord. * Superficial dissection of the medulla oblongata and pons. a.

CERVICAL NERVES. 173 Action. By approximating the transv erse processes these muscles use. bend the spinal column laterally. Cervical nerves at their exit from the spinal canal. Cervical The trunks of the cervical nerves issue from the spinal canal through their'^fora- the intervertebral foramina, excejjt the first two, and bifurcate into minagive anterior and posterior primary branches. The anterior primary branch passes outwards between the inter- anterior transverse muscles, and joins in a jjlexus with its fellows (p. 72). Fig. 48.* The posterior primary branch tiiiiis to the back beneath the and pos- posterior intertransverse muscle and the otlier muscles attached to branches, the posterior transverse processes ; in its course it lies close to the bone between the articular jjrocesses of the vertebra. Peculiarities in the first tivo. The first two nerves leave the spinal First two canal above the neural arches of the atlas and axis, and divide at differ: tlie back of the neck into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior primary branch of the first or suboccipital nerve has anterior and been examined (p. 113). The anterior branch of the second nerve, after perforating the membrane between the neural arches of the first and second vertebrae, is directed forwards outside the vertebral arter}-, and between the two intertransverse muscles of the first space, to join the cervical plexus. * Deep muscles of the front of the neck and scaleni.

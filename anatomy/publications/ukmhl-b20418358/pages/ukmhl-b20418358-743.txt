729 CILIARY VESSELS AND NERVES. The arteries of tlie iris (fig. 238, b) have a looped arrangement : they are derived chiefly from the long and the anterior ciliary branches (d), but some come from the vessels of the ciliary pro- €esses. On arriving at the ciliary muscle, the long and anterior ciliary arteries form a circle (e) round the margin of the iris ; from this ring other anastomotic branches are directed towards the pupil, near which they join in a second arterial circle (/). From the last circle capillaries run to the edge of the pupil, and end in veins. The vems resemble the arteries in their arrangement in the iris, and terminate in the veins of the choroid coat. The nerves of the iris are the terminal branches of the ciliary nerves : they divide into branches which accompany the blood-vessels, and communicate with one another so as to form <\ plexus which gets gradually iiner towards the pupil (fig. i38, a). Ciliary vessels and nerves (fig. 235). The ciliary arteries are offsets of the ophthalmic '(p. 46), and supply the choroid, the ciliary processes, and the iris. They are classed into posterior nnd anterior, and two of the first set are named long ciliary ; but they will not be seen without a special injection of the vessels of the eye. The iMsterior ciliary arteries {(j) pierce the sclerotic coat around and close to the optic nerve, and running forwards on the choroid, <livide into branches which enter its substance at diff'erent points. Two of this set (long ciliary) are directed forwards between the ■sclerotic and choroid, one on each side of the eyeball, and form a ■Arcle round the iris in the ciliary muscle, as before explained. In the ball the outer one lies rather above, and the iimer, rather below the middle. The anterior ciliary arteries, five or six in number, are smaller than the posterior, and arise at the front of the orbit from muscular iDranches (p. 46) ; they pierce the sclerotic coat about a line l^ehind the cornea, supply the ciliary processes, and join the circle of the long ciliary vessels. In inflammation of the iris these vessels are ^enlarged, and offsets of them form a ring round the cornea. The imsterior ciliary veins have a diflerent arrangement from the ixrteries. The branches form arches {vasa vorticosa; fig. 235, h) in * Distribution of the nerves and vessels of the iris. A. Half of the iris showing the nerves, a.

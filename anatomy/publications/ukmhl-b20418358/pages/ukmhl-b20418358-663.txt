649 INTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. oritrm: inside the pelvis (p. 594), and passes to tlie exterior through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. The tendon of the muscle is directed ^^^^1^? outwards over the hip-joint, and is inserted with the gemelli, iii ingej-^iou • front of the pyriformis, into the inner side of the great trochanter, at the upper and fore part. Outside the pelvis the obturator is mostly tendinous, and is relations; embraced by the gemelli muscles, which near the pelvis meet be- neath the tendon ; but near the trochanter they cover it. Crossing the muscle are the large and small sciatic nerves and the sciatic vessels ; and covering the whole is the gluteus maximus. On tendon is cutting through the tendon and raising the inner end, it will be thredge^oV found divided into four or five pieces as it turns over the ischium ti^e pelvis; (fig. 208, h) ; at this spot the bone is covered with cartilage, which forms ridges corresponding to the intervals between the tendinous slips, and the surfaces are lubricated iDy a synovial sac. There is sometimes another bursa between the tendon and the hip-joint. Action. The action of this muscle is in all respects the same as , that of the pyriformis (p. 644). pyn i» i-''- The QUADRATUS TEMORis (fig. 206, g) is situate between the j^^^J^^^j^^^^^^ inferior gemellus and the adductor magnus. Internally it arises from the outer border of the ischial tuberosity for two inches, by the side of the semimembranosus and adductor magnus ; externally it is inserted into an eminence on the posterior intertrochanteric insertion; ridge of the femur (tubercle of the quadratus), and along a line on the upper end of that bone for about one inch and a half, above the attachment of the great adductor. By one surface it is in contact with the sciatic vessels and nerves, P'^i'ts over and the gluteus maximus. By the other it rests on the obturator externus, the internal circumflex vessels, and its small nerve and vessels. Between its lower border and the adductor mamus the an'^at lower bonier; transverse branch of the internal circumflex artery issues. Between it and the small,trochanter is a bursa, which is also common to the upper part of the adductor magnus. Action. The quadratus diflers from the foregoing muscles of the "se. same group in being able to rotate out the femur when the hip-joint is bent, as well as in the extended position; and it will assist slightly in adducting the limb. Dissection (fig. 208). The quadratus and the gemelli muscles may ^^^^^^^y. be now cut across, in order that their small nerve and artery, the and gemelli. ending of the internal circumflex artery, and the obturator externus may be dissected out. The INTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX branch (fig. 208,/) of the profunda Jj^j,*^^™^^^^^^ artery (p. 634) divides finally into two pieces. One (ascending; g) artery runs beneath the quadratus (in this position of the body) to the pit of the trochanter, where it anastomoses with the gluteal and sciatic ends in two arteries, and sujjplies the bone. The other {transverse; h) passes between the quadratus and adductor magnus to the hamstring muscles, and communicates with the perforating arteries. The OBTURATOR EXTERNUS (fig. 208, l) lias been dissected at its obturator ^ ° ^ ^ externus

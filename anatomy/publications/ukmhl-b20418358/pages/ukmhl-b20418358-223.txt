LOBES OF CEl^EBRAL HEMISPHEEE. 209 The furroiv of Rolando (central sulcus ; fig. 66, r) crosses tlie outer Sulcus of surface of the hemisphere near the middle. Beginning above close ^^^'^^'^^o to the margin of tht; great longitudinal fissure, the furrow runs downwards and somewhat forwards, with a serpentine course, to end about one inch behind the place of division of the Sylvian fissure, and very near to its posterior lind). This sulcus is used to separate the frontal from the parietal lobe. The upper end "of the furrow of Eolando is placed from an incli- i« behind and-a-half to two inches, the lower end about one inch behind the suture.^ coronal suture. jMrieto-ocxipital fissure (fig. 68, j9o) is a deep sulcus at the Parieto- liinder j^art of the inner surface of the hemisphere. Its upper end ||!^^ure-"^ appears on the superior surface of the cerebrum about midway between the preceding sulcus and the posterior extremity of the liemisphere, and extends outwards for nearly an inch from the margin of the longitudinal fissure (fig. 66, //o). It indicates the anterior limit of the occipital lobe. The jjarieto-occipital fissure is placed o})posite the summit of the situHtiun. lambdoid suture. Lobes. The outer surface of the hemispliere is divided into five Lobes of lobes (excluding the olfactory) which have the following names and ^"""'"l'^"^'''^- limits :— The frontal lobe forms the anterior half of the hemisphere. It is Frontal Mn limited below by the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius ^ • (fig. 66, and behind by the furrow of Eolando (r). Its under part, wliich rests on the roof of the orbit, is named the orbital oi-bital lobuie. The 2)arietal lobe is little more than half the size of the frontal. I'aiietal Its anterior limit is the furrow of Eolando (?'), and its posterior a line drawn transversely over the hemisphere from the parieto-occipital fissure. Below, it is bounded in its fore part by the posterior boundaries branch of the figsure of Sylvius (/"), and in its hinder part l)y a pait"^ line extending from the spot where this sulcus turns upwards to the artiiiciui. posterior extremity of the liemisphere. Its convolutions are con- tinuous with those of the occipital lobe behind, and of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe below. The occipital lobe is small, and triangular in shape. It is separated j^^^'^'^''*^^ from the j)arietal lobe for a short distance above by the parieto- occipital fissure (po) ; but its anterior boundary is for the most part artificial, being constituted by a line continuing the direction of that fissure across the outer surface of the hemisphere. Its convolutions join those of the parietal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe projects into the middle fossa of the Tempon.- base of the skull. Its fore part is separated from the frontal and S',"'"""'''^' ])arietal lobes by the fissure of Sylvius, but its hinder part is only limited by the lines above mentioned, across which its con- volutions pass into those of the parietal and occipital lobes. The central lobe, insula, or island of Eeil (fig. 67, c), is placed at the bottom of the fissure of Sylvius, and is concealed by the over- i^und of lapping of the temporo-sphenoidal, parietal and frontal lobes.

DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 614 it reaches from the base of GiiuLeriiat s ligament to the upper coTiiu of the saphenous opening. It decreases rapidly in size from above down, and is closed below. The aperture by which the space com- municates with the cavity of the abdomen is named the crural ring, parts In front of the canal are Poupart's ligament and the upper end aroxmd it. ^Â£ falciform margin of the saphenous opening ; while behind it is the pectineus muscle. On tlie outer side of the canal, but in Fig. 200.* the sheath, is the femoral vein. Through this channel the intestine passes from the abdomen in femoral hernia. Cruial ling: The crural ring is the upper opening of the crural canal. It is on a level with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 154, d), and situation is larger in the female than in the male. Oval in shape, its greatest an form , measurement is from side to side, in which direction it efjuals about half an inch ; and it is filled b}^ a lymphatic gland. boundaries. The structures around the ring, outside the crural sheath, are similar to those bounding the canal, viz., in front, the superficial and the deep crural arch, and behind, the pubis covered by the pectineus muscle. Internally is Gimbernat's ligament with the conjoined tendon ; and externally (but within the sheath) is the femoral vein. The position of vessels on the several sides of the ring is stated at page 470. * Dissection of the crural slieatli (Illustrations of Dissections), a. Iliac part of the fascia lata, reflected, b.

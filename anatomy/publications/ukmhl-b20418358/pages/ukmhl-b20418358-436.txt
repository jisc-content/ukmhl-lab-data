Tlie perineiini may be allotted "with greatest advaii- pa^s^^catile- dissector of the alxloinen ; and its examination should ter. be made first, as tlie distinctness of many of tlie parts is destroyed soon after death. Before the body is placed in the position suited for the dissection, the student may ])ractise passing the catheter along the urethra. Place the Position of the hochj. The body is most conveniently supported body in (or the dissection of the jierineum by placing it on a sj^ecial perineal ixtsi joii. Ij^it \yi the absence of this it may be fixed in the following manner :—While the body lies on the back it is to be drawn to the end of tlie dissecting table, till the buttocks project slightly over the edge ; and a block is to be placed beneath the pelvis, to raise ami fasten the perineum to a convenient height. The knees having been bent, tiie™^^!^ the thighs are to be raised upon the trunk, and the limbs fastened Avitli a cord in their bent position. For this i^ui'pose make one or two tttrns with the cord round one bent knee (say the right) ; carry the cord beneath the table, and, encircling the opposite limb in the same manner, fasten it finally roitnd the right knee. When the position has been arranged, let the student raise the scrotum, and place a small piece of cotton-wool or tow within the anus, but with- (Utt distending the rectum. Tlie surface Sujjerficial limits and marhing.

In the middle line is the. aperture of the anus, which is behind a line extending from the anterior part of the one ischial tuberosity to the other. In front of the anus the surface is slightly convex over the urethra, and j)resents a longitudinal prominent line the raphe, or raphe, which divides the space into halves. Betw.een the anus hollow on and the ttiberosity of the hip-bone the surface is somewhat depressed sideofanu.s. ^^^^^ hollow of the subjacent ischio-rectal fossa, especially in emaciated bodies. and folds The margin of the anal aperture j^ossesses numerous converging around that ^^^^^r ^^^^^ these are more or less obliterated by the position of the opening.

Tlie trunk of the external carotid artery is to be removed by cutting it through where the hypoglossal nerve crosses it, and by dividing those- Itranches of it that have been already examined : any A'eiiis accom- panying the arteries are to be taken away.

Its position is between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus Jjf^.Jj^^iJ^^ muscles, and over the internal carotid artery ; while the lower end in-, is placed beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. To its posterior border, the middle constrictor muscle is attached below. It is frequentl}' cartilaginous or osseous in part of, or occasionally in all its extent. Sometimes a slip of fleshy fibres is continued along it.

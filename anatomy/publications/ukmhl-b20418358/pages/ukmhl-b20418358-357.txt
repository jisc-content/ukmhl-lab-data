THE PERICARDIUM. 343 Seek tlie following nerves of the left side, wliicli cross the arch of Seek nerves the aorta :—The largest and deepest is the vagus ; the next largest 3™^!)"^ in size, in front of the vagus, is the phrenic. Between the preced- i^ortsi. ing nerves, and close to the artery, are the left superficial cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, and the lower cervical cardiac hranch of the left vagus ; of the two, the last is the smaller, and in front of the other. The cardiac nerves from the left vagus and sympathetic are to be Dissect followed to a small plexus (superficial cardiac) in the concavity of pifxuslu^ the aorta. An offset of the plexus is to be traced downwards ^^"^'^ «f between the pulmonary artery and the aorta towards the right coronary artery of the heart ; and another prolongation is to be found coming forwards from the deep cardiac to the superficial jDlexus : this dissection is difficult, and requires care. When the pericardium is afterwards opened the nerves will be followed on the heart. Oftentimes these small nerves are destroyed in injecting the l)ody. The PERiCxVRDiUM is somewhat conical in form, the wider part Peiicai- being turned towards the diaphragm, and the narrower part extending " upwards beyond the heart on the large vessels. It is placed behind fonif; " the sternum, and projects on each side of that bone, but much moi-e position; t(3wards the left than the right side. Laterally the pericardium is covered by the pleura, and the phrenic nerve and vessels lie between j.^^iations the two. Its anterior surface is separated from the chest-wall by the pleurae and lungs, except over a small area on the left side corre- sponding to the lower part of the anterior mediastinum (p. 339) ; and behind, in the interval between the pleura), it is in contact with the oesophagus and aorta. The heart-case consists of a fil)rous structure, which is lined Composi- internally by a serous membrane. The fibrous part surrounds the heart, and is pierced by the large Fibi-ouspart vessels joining that organ, with the exception of the inferior cava : |}\g^ths to it gives ]>rolongations around the vessels, and the strongest of these vessels, sheaths is on the aorta. Below, it is united to the central tendon of the diaphragm. This membrane is thickest at the upper part, and is formed of fibres crossing in different directions, many being longitudinal. When the pericardium has been cut open, the serous lining will be seen. The serous sac consists of a parietal and a visceral part, which are serous continuous with one another along the great vessels. The parietal {f^^j^o^g"^'^ part lines the fibrous membrane, with, which it is inseparably united, and the included portion of the diaphragm ; while the visceral i^art covers the heart. Where it is reffected around the and covers vessels, it encloses the pulmonary artery and aorta in one sheath ; ^^^^^^ > but the veins are not completely surrounded, their posterior sur- disposition faces being devoid of a serous investment. At the back of the left ^If^^^^. auricle the serous membrane forms a pouch between the pulmonary veins of the two sides. In front of the root of the left lung the serous layer forms a f^i'jf'S'^^

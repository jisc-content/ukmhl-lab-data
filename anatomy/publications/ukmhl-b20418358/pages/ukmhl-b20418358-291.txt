CUTANEOUS NERVES OF ARM. 271 branch of tlie median, for the radial vein is oftentimes very small : it is continued to the shoulder along the outer side of the biceps, and sinks between the deltoid and pectoral muscles to open into the axillary vein near the clavicle. The superficial lymphatics of the arm lie for the most part along Superficial the basilic vein, and enter the glands of the axilla. A few lym- ^^"^i'^^^*^^-^ phatics accompany tlie cephalic vein, and end in the ujjper axillary glands. One or more superficial lympliatic glands are commonly found a and glands, little above the inner condyle of the humerus. Cutaneous Nerves. The superficial nerves of the arm appear on superficial the inner and outer sides, and spread so as to cover the surface of the limb. With one exception (intercosto-humeral) all are derived from the brachial plexus, either as distinct branches, or as offsets of other nerves. On the outer side of the limb are branches of the musculo-sj^iral and musculo-cutaneous nerves. On the inner side are two internal cutaneous nerves from the plexus, a third internal cutaneous from the musculo-spiral, and the intercosto-humeral nerve. The EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS BRANCHES OF THE MUSCULO-SPIRAL External NERVE are two in number, and appear at the outer side of the ^erver'^^^ limb about the middle. The upper small one turns forwards ^^^^ fi.„„^ with the cephalic vein, and reaches the front of the elbow, ^^^l^^^Y^' supplying the anterior part of the arm. The lower and larger pierces the fascia somewhat farther down, and after suj^plying .some cutaneous filaments to the back of the arm, is continued to the forearm. The MUSCULO-CUTANEOUS NERVE pierces the fascia in front of JJJ^J^^"^^^.^" the elbow ; it lies beneath the median-cephalic vein, and divides neous. into branches for the forearm. The INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE perforates the fascia in two internal pieces, or as one trunk that divides almost directly into two. Its ^^erveT:"'' anterior branch passes beneath the median-basilic vein to the front of the forearm ; and the posterior winds over the iiiner condyle of large, the humerus to the l,)ack of the forearm. A slender offset of the nerve pierces the fascia near the axilla, and reaches as far, or nearly as far, as the elbow : it supplies the integuments over the l)iceps muscle. The NERVE OF AVrisberg (small internal cutaneous) appears aud small: behind the preceding, and extends to the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus, where it ends in filaments over the back of the olecranon. The nerve gives offsets to the lower third of the arm on the inner and posterior surfaces, and joins above the elbow the posterior liranch of the larger internal cutaneous nerve. The INTERNAL CUTANEOUS BRANCH OF THE MUSCULO-SPIRAL t^ie^fijfJ''i NERVE, becoming subcutaneous in the upper third, winds to the spiral; back of the arm, and reaches nearly as far as the olecranon. The INTERCOSTO-HUMERAL NERVE, a branch of the second inter-and inter- costal 249), perforates the fascia near the axilla, and ramifies on fiunierai.

DISSECTION OF THE HAND. 304 one of these is directed backwards by the side of the metacarpal phalanx, and after uniting with the digital nerve on the back of the finger (p. 290), is continued to the dorsum of the last phalanx. Dissection Dissection. The tendons â€¢ of the flexor muscles may next be mitlonsf''^^^ followed to their termination. To expose them, the ulnar artery should be cut through below the origin of the deep branch ; and Fig. 98.* the superficial volar branch of the radial having been divided, the palmar arch is to be thrown towards the fingers. The ulnar and median nerves are also to be cut below the annular ligament, and turned downwards. Divide ^ longitudinal incision is to be made through the centre of the ment^^'^ ^^^^i^^^^^i' ligament, without injuring the muscles that arise from it, and the pieces of the ligament are to be thro^vn to the sides.

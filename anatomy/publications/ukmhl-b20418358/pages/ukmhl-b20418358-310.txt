DISSECTION OF FRONT OF FOREARM. 296 position on the annular ligament. Its branches are muscnlar anterior and jiosterior recurrent, On the annular ligament the artery has passed through the fascia, and lies close to the pisi- formhone. The ulnarnerve, with its palmar brancli, still accompanies the ves- sel on the inner side. Branches. The greater nnmher of the offsets of the artery are distributed to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- ing :— a. The aitterior ulnar recurrent branch frequently arises in common with the next, and ascends on the brachialis anticus muscle, to join the branch of the anastomotic artery beneath the pronator teres. It gives offsets to the conti- guous muscles. h. The 'posterior ulnar recurrent Iranch ((?), of larger size than the ante- rior, is directed beneath the flexor sublimis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. There it passes Avith the ulnar nerve be- tween the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the ramifica- tions of the inferior pro- funda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow-joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve. ■* Dissection of the deep muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two groups of muscles.

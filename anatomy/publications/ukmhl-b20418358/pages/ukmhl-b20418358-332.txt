The supinator hrevis is concealed altogether at the jDOsterior and external aspects of the limb by the muscles of the superficial layer ; and anteriorly the radial vessels and nerve lie over it. The lower ])order is contiguous to the extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, only the posterior interosseous vessels (a) intervening. Through the substance of the muscle the ])osterior interosseous nerve (^) winds to the back of the limb. Action. When the radius has been moved over the ulna in pronation, the short supinator comes into play to bring that bone again to the outer side of the ulna. The POSTERIOR INTEROHSEOUS ARTERY (fig. 103, a) is an otfset from the common interosseous trunk (p. 297), and reaches the back of the forearm alcove the membrane between the bones. Appearing between the contiguous borders of the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the artery descends at first between the superficial and deep layers of muscles ; and afterwards, with a superficial position in th(! lower third of the forearm, along the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris as far as the wrist, where it ends by anastomosing with the carpal and anterior interosseous arteries. It furnishes muscular offsets to the surrounding muscles, and the following recurrent branch :â€” The recurrent branch (h) springs from the artery near the beginning, and ascends on or through the fibres of the supinator, l>ut beneath the anconeus, to supply both those muscles and the elbow-joint ; it anastomoses with the superior profunda arterj^and the recurrent radial. The POSTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS NERVE (^) is derived from the musculo-spiral trunk (p. 286), and winds backwards through the fibres of the supinator brevis. Issuing from the supinator, the nerve is placed between tlie superficial and deep layers of muscles as far as the middle of the forearm. Much reduced in size at that s^^ot, it sinks beneath the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, and runs on the interosseous membrane to the back of the carpus. Finally, the nerve enlarges beneath the tendons of the extensor com- munis digitorum, and terminates in filaments to the articulations of the carpus. Branches. It furnishes oftsets to all the muscles of the deep layer, and to those of the superficial layer with the exception of the three following, viz., anconeus, supinator longus,and extensor carpi radialis longior. Radial artery at the wrist (fig. 103). The radial artery (d), with its vena3 comites, winds below the radius to the back of the carpus, and enters the palm of the hand at the first interosseous space, between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. At first the vessel lies deeply on the external lateral ligament of the Avrist-joint, and beneath the tendons of the extensors of the meta- carpal bone (e) and the fii'st phalanx of the thumb (f) ; but afterwards

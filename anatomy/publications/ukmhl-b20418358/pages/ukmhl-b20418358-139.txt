SUPEEIOE CONSTRICTOE MUSCLE. 125 The posterior surface of this muscle is to a great extent concealed relations, by the inferior constrictor. Laterally, it touches the carotid sheath; and its origin is beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual artery passing between the two. Its upper border is separated from the superior constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus ; and in the interval between the origins of the middle and inferior constrictors are the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels. The SUPERIOR CONSTRICTOR is thinner than the others, and of a Upper quadrilateral form. It has a broad origin from the following parts arS from in succession, commencing above,—the lower end of the internal pterygoid pterygoid plate and the hamular process, the pterygo-maxillary faw^S ligament, the hinder part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, ^^^s^^ • the mucous membrane of the mouth, and the side of the tongue. The fibres pass backwards, and are inserted by joining those of the inserted fellow muscle along the middle line, where a tendinous raphe* is ^ raphi"^" formed between the two for the upper half of their depth. Some of the highest fibres end on the aponeurosis of the pharynx. The parts in contact with this muscle externally are the deep relations; vessels and nerves of the neck at the side, the middle constrictor and prevertebral muscles behind : internally are the aponeurosis of the pharynx and the palato-pharyngeus muscle. The upper border j^g^^^^^Jj forms an arch with the concavity upwards extending from the muscle and pterygoid plate to the basilar process ; and the space between it and the base of the skull is occupied by the aponeurosis of the pharynx, which projects outwards above the muscle, and by the levator palati. Eustachian tube and inferior palatine artery. The attachment to the pterygo-maxillary ligament corresponds with the origin of the buccinator muscle (i). Action of constrictors. The muscles of both sides contracting at Use of the same time will diminish the size of the pharynx ; and as the anterior attachments of the lower muscles are nearer together than those of the upper, the tube will be contracted more behind the larynx than near the head. In swallowing, the object is first seized by the lower part of the in swallow- upper constrictor, and then forced on to the oesophagus by the sue- ' cessive action of the middle and inferior constrictors. Since the back of the pharynx is closely applied to the prevertebral muscles, from which it cannot be separated in the natural condition of the parts, the effect of the contraction of these muscles is to draw the tongue, hyoid bone and larynx backwards, as well as somewhat upwards owing to the oblique direction of the greater number of the fibres of the middle and lower constrictors ; and the cavity, when empty, is compressed from before backwards. The upper part of the superior constrictor narrows the space of upper above the mouth, and assists in bringing together the posterior '^^'^^^^^^^^'^ pillars of the soft palate. (See the action of the palato-pharyn- geus.) The pterygo-maxillarij ligament is a thin fibrous band which ^^^f^^^^y passes from the tip of the hamular process to the hinder end of the ligament, mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, and gives origin in front to the

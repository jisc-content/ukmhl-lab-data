207 UPPEE SURFACE OF CEREBRUM. The olfactory tract i.s a prismatic band, aljotit an incli long, the Olfactory upper edge of which h received into the olfactory sulcus. It is ^^^^^' attached by its base, where it is somewhat expanded, to the frontal lobe close in front of the anterior perforated space ; and from this part two diverging white streaks, the roots of the olfactory tract or roots, outer olfactory strke, proceed to neighbouring convolutions. The external root passes along the outer margin of the anterior perforated space, and across the beginning of the Sylvian fissure, to the anterior extremity of the uncinate convolution in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The internal root, not always visible, bends inwards, and and inner, joins the lower end of the callosal convolution. By raising the olfactory lobe from its sulcus, the dorsal riclge will be seen to Olfactory become enlarged at its posterior end, forming the olfactory tubercle, ^^^^^^cie. Position of the part. ISTow that the base of the cerebrum has been Position of studied, the brain should be turned over for the examination of the upper jiart. Something should then be placed beneath the fore part, upper part, in order that it may be raised to the same level as the back ; and a rolled-up cloth should lo(jsely encircle the whole, to support the hemispheres. Upper Surface of the Cerebrum. Viewed from above, the cerebrum is cerelirum is ovoidal in form, and the upper surface is convex in convex a-DOVG ciud accordance with the shape of the skull. A riiedicm longitndinal fissure divides tlie cerebrum incompletely divided into into halves. At the front and back the hemispheres are quite ^^i^n^ separated by it ; but at the middle and under parts they are united fissure by connecting bodies, the largest of wliich is the white corpus callosum. In the lissure the falx cerebri is lodged. Each hemisphere is larger in front than behind, although the Hemispiioi e greatest breadth of the cereljrum is placed behind tlie middle. Its outer surface is convex and applied to the skull ; the inner is flat and rests against the falx cerebri. The surface of the hemisphere grey on consists of grey matter (cortex of the cerebrum), and is marked by ^'^''^f^'^' . 1 , mi . marked by tortuous eminences separated by grooves. The eminences are named convoiu- convolutio7is or gyri; the grooves are furrows or sulci. furrows*^ The sulci of the cerebrum are of two kinds. The greater number Furrows are are superficial depressions which carry inwards the grey cortex and incomplete only indent the central white substance ; but a few penetrate more deeply, and these are the result of folds involving the whole thick- and ness of both grey and white substance, so as to affect the form of ^^^^P^^*^- the cavity (lateral ventricle) contained within the liemisiDhere, or give rise to eminences projecting on its wall. The sulci of the â–  latter group are distinguished as fissures. The convolutions and sulci, especially the smaller ones, vary in Convolu- different brains, and they are not exactly alike even in the two 1,^^^^ hemispheres of the same cerebrum. Their general arrangement or plan is, however, constant, and there will seldom be much difficulty plan is in recognizing the several parts referred to in the following de- ^^i^o^i^- scription. Interlobar Sulci and Lobes of the Hemisphere. The outer Division of surface of the hemisphere is divided into regions, or groups of con- gphere!^^'

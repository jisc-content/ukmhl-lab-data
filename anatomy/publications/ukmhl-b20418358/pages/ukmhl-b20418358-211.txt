197 FIBRES OF MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Pyramid and anterior column. The fibres of tlie pyramid fonii a Fibres of well-defined and independent bundle (fig. 61 a) through the whole extent of the medulla oblongata, and are continued below partly into the anterior column of the same side, and partly into the lateral column of the ojDposite half of the cord. The set of fibres keeping to tlie same side forms the outer portion of the pyramid, but in the anterior column of the cord, where it is known as the direct pyramidal direct, tract, it is placed close to the anterior median fissure. The decussating fibres are the more numerous, and pass oblirpiely and crossed, backwards, across the median fissure and behind the opposite Fi>. 60.* anterior column, to enter the lateral column, where they constitute the crossed pijramidal tract. Upwards, the fibres of the pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the crusra of the cerebral peduncle (fig. 59, c, d). The fibres of the anterior column of the cord which Rest of ^ o 5 5 / _ ... anterior are not continued into the pyramid incline backwards, and enter the coimim. reticular formation of the medulla oblongata. The decussation of the ^pyramids (fig. 59, h) occupies the anterior ^f^py^^j*|^g fissure of the medulla oblongata at a distance of three-cjuarters of an inch from the pons. It is about a quarter of an inch in length, and is generally constructed by the crossing of three or four bundles of * Deep dissection of tbe medulla oblongata, pons, and cms cerebri, a.

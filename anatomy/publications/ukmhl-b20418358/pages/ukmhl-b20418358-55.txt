The frontal nerve (fig. 11,") is close to the outer side of the Frontal fourth as it enters the orbit, and is much larger than the lachrymal branch. In its course to the forehead the nerve lies along the g^p^^^^j.^"^^^ middle of the orbit; and after giving off from its inner side the and supra-' supratrochlear branch it leaves the cavity by the supraorbital ^^'odilear. notch. Taking the name snpraorhital, it ascends on the forehead, Fiff. 11.* where it is distributed. This nerve frequently divides into its two main branches (p. 6) while still within the orbit. While in the notch the supraorbital nerve gives one or two pal23e- Palpebral bral filaments to the upper Hd. filaments. The supratrochlear nerve (^) passes inwards above the pulley of Supratrocii- the upper oblique muscle, and leaves the orbit to end in the eyelid ^^^^ branch, and forehead (p. 7).

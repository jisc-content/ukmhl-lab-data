TEMPOEAL MUSCLE. 83 Dissection. To lay bare the temporal muscle to its insertion, tlie To see following dissection may be made :—The temporal fascia is to be temporal detached from the upper border of the zygomatic arch and removed muscle, from the surface of the muscle. Next, the arch is to be sawn through in front and behind, so as to include all its length ; and is to be thrown down (without being cut olf) with the masseter still attached to it, by separating the fibres of that muscle from the ramus of the jaw. In detaching the masseter, its nerve and vessels, which pass through the sigmoid notch, will come into view, and should be dissected out of the muscle. The surface of the temporal muscle may be then cleaned. And J^gl^ioJ*^ to expose its termination, let the coronoid process be sawn off by a Fig. 20.* cut passing from the centre of the sigmoid notch to the last molar tooth, so as to include the whole insertion of the muscle. Before sawing the bone let the student find and separate from the muscle the buccal vessels and nerve issuing from beneath it. Lastly, the coronoid process should be raised and the fat removed, in order that the lower fibres of the temporal muscle, and their contiguity to the external pterygoid beneath them, may be seen. The TEMPORAL MUSCLE (fig. 20, ^) arises from the fascia covering Origin of it, and from the bones forming the temporal fossa (p. 4), reaching mJJgcie^^ upwards to the semicircular line on the side of the skull, and down- * Superficial view of the pterygoid region (Quain's ''Arteries"). 1.

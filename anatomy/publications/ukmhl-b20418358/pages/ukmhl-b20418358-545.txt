531 ACTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM. Action of the diafphragm. By the contraction of tlie muscular Use iu fibres the tendon is moved downwards, and the arch of the diaphragm r<^sri^^*io"- is lessened in inspiration ; and during their relaxation, the centre of the muscle is elevated, and the height of the vault increased in expiration, owing to the elasticity of the lungs, and the pressure of the viscera below, which are forced upwards by the action of the abdominal muscles (p. 448). In the descent of the diaphragm, the parts of the tendon move Central part unequally, in consequence of difierences in their relations, and in "east f the length of the fleshy fibres connected with them. Thus, the central lobe, above which the heart is placed, moves least; while the lateral lobes, which are below the lungs, descend more freely, left part the right, however, less than the left, owing to the presence of the ^XJJJage liver. It is estimated that the central lobe of the tendon moves V!^ downwards in full inspiration about two-fifths of an inch, the right tion"^^^"'^ lobe twice as much, and the left lobe one inch (Hasse). In forced ^^^^^^ expiration the muscle reaches as high as the fourth rib on the right expiration, side, and the fifth on the left, close to the sternum. With the movement of the diaphragm the size of the cavities of ^^^^^^^^^^JJi^^ tlie abdomen and thorax will be altered. By its descent the thorax abdomen, is enlarged, and the abdomen diminished ; and the viscera in the on viscera, upper part of the latter cavity, viz., liver, stomach, and spleen, are partly moved from beneath the ribs. By its ascent the cavity of the thorax is lessened, and that of the abdomen is restored to its former size ; and the displaced viscera return to their usual place. By the contraction of the fibres the aperture for the oesophagus will Upe^.^irgy be rendered smaller, and that tube may be compressed ; but the other openings for the vena cava and aorta are not materially changed. The action of the diaphragm is commonly involuntary, but it is ^^^^^^^^^^ perfectly under the control of the will. Dissection. After the diaphragm has been learnt, the ribs that Jj:jJ^^^'^?^^2rt support it on each side may be cut through, and the loose pieces of of the bone with the fore part of the diaphragm may be taken away, to t^'aphragm. facilitate the dissection of the deeper vessels and muscles. But the posterior third of the diaphragm, with its pillars and arches, should be left ; and the vessels ramifying on it should be followed back to their origin. The large vessels of the abdomen, viz., the aorta and the vena clean aorta, 11 11 • ^ o • r xi cava, and cava, are to be cleaned by removing the lat, the remains oi the branches; sympathetic plexuses, and the lymphatic glands ; and their branches are to be followed to the diaphragm, to the kidney and suprarenal body, and to the testicle. In like manner the large iliac branches ^y^gge|,f ' of the aorta and cava are to be laid bare as far as Poupart's ligament. The ureter and the spermatic vessels are to be cleaned as they cross the iliac artery ; and on the same vessel, near the thigh, branches of a small nerve (genito-crural) are to be sought. The muscles are to be laid bare on the right side, but on the left Dissect • ipiisclcs * side the fascia covering them is to be shown ; and the fat is to be ' cleared away from the kidney. M M 2

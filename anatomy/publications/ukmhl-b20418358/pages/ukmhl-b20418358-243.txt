The constricted portion of the brain between the optic thalami Midbrain, above and the pons and cerebellum below is known as the isthmus <ierehri or mesencephalon, and occupies, when the brain is in the skull, the aperture of the tentorium. The dorsal part of the Lamina mesencephalon is formed by a layer which is marked on the surface quadri- by four eminences—the corpora quadrigemina, and is therefore ° named tlie lamina quadrigemina.

The inferior (testis ; i) is smaller, but more prominent, and inferior, rounded ; it is, also whiter in colour than the npper one. From the outer side of each quadrigeminal body a wdiite band, hracliiam Brachia. (fig. 76) is continued outwards and forwards : the upper brachium ■passes into the optic tract ; while the lower band smks beneath a internal small but well defined oval prominence, wdiich is placed between tlie g^"^^^"'^''^^*' crus cerebri and the optic thalamus, and is named the internal geniculate body. The quadrigeminal bodies are small masses of grey substance, covered by a wliite layer. From the grey matter of the upper one fibres of the optic tract take origin. Behind the quadrigeminal bodies are seen the superior peduncles Below testis of the cerebellum (fig. 72, ^; 81, sp) with the valve of Vieussens seen^'^^^^ (fig. 72, h) between them. Issuing from beneath the transverse "fibres of pons, and arching over the cerebellar peduncle, is an oblique, slightly raised band named Xh^ fillet (fig. 81,/), which disappears imder the lower quadrigeminal body and its brachium.

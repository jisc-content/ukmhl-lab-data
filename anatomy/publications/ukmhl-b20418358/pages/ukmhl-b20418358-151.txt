SPONGY BONES AND MEATUSES. 137 From this wall three slightly convoluted osseous plates, named is i^'^egular turbinate or spongy hones (fig. 34), project into the cavity :â€”the pj,gggj^'^g upper (^) and middle (^) are processes of the ethmoid, but the lower spongy one (^) is a separate bone. The turbinate bones are confined to that ^'^^^^ portion of the outer wall which is situate above the hard palate. ^^^^ Between each turbinate bone and the wall of the nose is a longitudinal hollow or meatus ; and into these hollows the nasal duct and the sinuses of the surrounding bones open. The meatuses are the spaces arched over by the spongy bones ; and Meatuses, as the bones are limited to a certain part of the outer wall, so are the spaces beneath them. The upper meatus (fig. 34,^) is the smallest and straighest of the Upper three, and is limited to the posterior half of the space above the Fig. 34.* hard palate. Into its fore part the posterior ethmoidal cells open (fig. 33 and 35), and at its posterior end, in the dried skull, is the spheno-palatine foramen by which nerves and vessels enter the nose. The middle meatus, {fig. 34, ') is longer than the upper, reaching Middle from the posterior opening of the nasal fossa, nearly as far forwards as the hard palate. Tlie free border of the middle turbinate bone being curved upwards anteriorly, this meatus is open in front as well as below. On raising, or cutting away, the overhanging turbinate bone (fig. 35), a deep groove, hiatus semilunaris.^ will be seen in the Outer wall of the nasal cavity. 1. Upper turbinate bone. 2. Middle turbinate bone. 3. Inferior turbinate bone. 4. Flat part of the ethmoid bone. 6. Upper meatus, 7. Middle meatus. 8, Lower meatus. 9. Rudi- mentary fourth meatus. 10. Vestibule. The cut also shows the apertures of the glands of the nose.

SUPERFICIAL FASCIA OF GEOIN. 443 vessels from the tendon of tlie external oblique muscle. Tliis stratum, like the preceding, is to be traced around the cord to the scrotum ; and as the student follows it downwards, he will find it connected with Poupart's ligament, and blended with the fascia lata close below that structure. The SUPERFICIAL FASCIA is a single layer over the greater part of Superficial the abdomen ; but in the groin it is divided into a subcutaneous ^^^^'^ and a deeper stratum by the vessels and the glands. Into two^ The subcutaneous layer contains the fat, and varies therefore in layers.', appearance and thickness in different bodies ; for it is sometimes ^^^1^^^!^^.'^'"' divisible into strata, Avhile at others it is very thin, and somewhat layer con- membranous near the thigh. It is continuous with the fatty ^'""'^ covering of the thigh and abdomen; and when traced to the limb, it is separated from Poupart's ligament beneath by the superficial vessels and glands. Internally it is continued to the j^enis and except in scrotum, where it changes its adipose tissue for involuntary mus- and scro- cular fibre ; and after investing the testicle, it is prolonged to the tum. perineum. The deeper layer (fascia of Scarpa) is thinner and more mem- Deeper branous than the other, and is closely united to the tendon of the imi mein-'''' external obi icjue by fibrous bands along the linea alba. Like the > subcutaneous part, this layer is continued upwards on the abdomen, j.^g^g^g ^nd and inwards to the penis and the scrotum, through Avhich it is pro- disposition; longed to the perineum, Avhere it has attachments to the subjacent parts, as before specified (p. 429). Towards the limb, it ends a and ends on little below Poupart's ligament by joining the fascia lata across the fascia lata, front of the thigh. Urine effused in the perineum from rupture of the urethra will Attach- be directed through the scrotum and along the spermatic cord to nli'ne comse" the abdomen (p. 430). From the arrangement of the deeper layer of effuse<i of the fascia across the thigh, it is evident that the fluid cannot pass down the limb^ though its progress over the front of the abdomen is uninterrupted. In the female the superficial fascia of the groin is separable into Faseia in two layers, and the disposition of each is nearly the same as in the ^^'^ female, male ; but the part that is continued to the scrotum in the one sex, enters the labium in the other. In the female the round ligament of the uterus is lost in it. Cutaneous Nerves. The skin of the abdomen is supplied Cutaneous mainly by the lower intercostal nerves : thus, the cutaneous branches ^^'^^^^ along the side of the belly are offsets from five or six of those nerves ; and the cutaneous branches along the front are the terminal are derived parts of the same trunks. Two other cutaneous offsets from the sources!^ lumbar plexus, viz., ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal, appear at the lower part of the abdomen. The LATERAL CUTANEOUS NERVES of the abdomen emerge between Lateral the digitations of the external oblique muscle, in a line with the iS^ercoatai!'^ same set of nerves on the thorax ; and the lowest are the most which posterior. As soon as they reach the surface they divide, with the divide into exception of the last, into an anterior and a posterior branch :â€”

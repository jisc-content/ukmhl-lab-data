EXTERNAL LIGAMENTS OF KNEE. 699 it is not attached to tlie femur; it is connected above with, tlie gastrocnemius, and below with the styloid process of the head of the fibula. The tendon of the hiceps is inserted by two pieces into the head of Tendon of the fibula ; and from both of these fibres are prolonged to the head diviSecL^^ of the tibia. The external lateral ligament passes between the pieces into which the tendon is split. The tendon of the jjopliteiis may be followed by dividing the Tendon of posterior ligament. It arises from the fore part of the oblong depression on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur. In its course to the outside of the joint, it crosses the ■ external semilunar fibro-cartilage and the upper tibio-peroneal articulation. When the joint is bent, the tendon lies in the hollow on the condyle ; but it slips out of that groove when the limb is extended. The tendon of the adductor magnns inserted into the adductor and of tubercle on the internal condyle of the femur, above the attachment fnalnilr of the internal lateral ligament. The internal lateral ligament (fig. 224, ^) is attached above to the internal condyle of the femur, where it blends with the capsule ; but becoming 1^^*^™! thicker below, and separate from the rest of the capsule, it is fixed ^^^^^-^^^ for about an inch into the inner surface of the tibia, below the level ments; of the ligamentum patella) : some of the deeper fibres join the internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. The tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles is joined by lie over the ligament; and the tendon of the semimembranosus, 1,1.™"^^"" and the internal lower articular vessels and nerve are l)eneath it. To the posterior edge some fibres from the tendon of the semimem- branosus are added. The tendon of the semimembranosus muscle is inserted beneath the insertion internal lateral ligament into the lower part of the groove at the j^fem^AuIl! back of the inner tuberosity of the tibia : between it and the upper sus. edge of the groove is a synovial bursa. The tendon sends a feAv fibres to the internal lateral ligament, a prolongation to join the fascia on the popliteus muscle, and another to the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The posterior ligament is wide and membranous, and is formed ^^^j^^gj^^^^' in great part by a strong slip from the tendon of the semimem- ° branosus, which is directed across the joint to the outer side. It is fixed below to the head of the tibia behind the articular surface ; and above, it is attached in the centre to the femur at the upper border of the intercondylar notch, but on each side' it joins the tendinous head of the gastrocnemius. Numerous apertures exist in it for the passage of vessels and nerves to the interior of the articu- lation ; and the tendon of the popliteus pierces its outer part. The anterior ligament or ligamentum patellcB (fig. 224, ^) is the Anterior infrapatellar part of the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscle ^^s^"^^^'*^ of the knee (p. 626). About two inches long, it is attached above is infra- to the apex and lower border of the patella ; and below to the tendon, tubercle of the tibia. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers

145 IJITEENAL MAXILLAEY ARTEKY. Tlie terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery in the vessels of spheno-maxillary fossa have been laid bare in the dissection of MeckeFs ganglion, but they may be now completely traced out. The NASAL NERVE (of the oijhthalmic) (fio-. 37 °) has been already Nasal nerve • ^1 in 11-^ T? ^ • /i 1V 1 . lies beneath seen m the skull and orbit. iLntering the nasal lossa by an aperture nasal bone; at the front of the ethmoid bone, the nerve gives a branch to the membrane of the septum, and then descends in a groove on the back of the nasal bone. At the lower margin of the latter it escapes between tlie bone and the upper lateral cartilage to the surface of the nose (p. 45). Brandies. The hranch to the septum (fig, 3G) divides into filaments i>ranfii u< that ramify on the anterior part of that partition, and reach nearly to the lower border. One or tiro filaments are likewise furnished by the nerve to the an^^ mucous membrane on the outer wall of the nasal fossa : these extend as low as the inferior spongy l^one. Terminal branches op the internal maxillary artery. The branches of the artery in the spheno-maxillary fossa, whicli maxillary have not been examined, are the superior palatine, nasal, pterygo- ^^'^^'^y ^i-'' palatine, and Vidian. The superior or descending palatine is tlie largest brancli, and accompanies the large palatine nerve through the canal, and along the roof of the mouth ; it anastomoses behind the incisor teeth with its fellow, and with the naso-palatine branch through the incisor foramen. This artery supplies offsets to the soft palate and tonsil through the other palatine canals, and some twigs are furnished to the lining membrane of the nose. In the roof of the mouth the mucous membrane, glands and gums receive their vessels from it. The nasal or sjjlieno-palatine artery enters the nose through the iiasal spheno-j)alatine foramen, and divides into brandies. Some of these ^^^^^ are distributed on the spongy bones, and the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and supply offsets to the posterior ethmoidal cells. One long brancli, naso-palatine or artery of the septum nasi, runs on the partition one to sep- between the nasal fosste to tlie incisor foramen, through Avhich it "^^^' anastomoses with the superior palatine in the roof of the mouth ; this branch accompanies the naso-palatine nerve, and covers the septum with numerous ramifications. The pterygo-palatine is a very small ln\anch which, passing back- P^JJ^J^^' wards through the canal of the same name, is distributed to the branch; lining membrane of the pharynx. The Vidian or pteriiqoid hranch is contained in the Vidian canal Vidian 1)1*3,11011 with the nerve of the same name, and ends on the mucous mem- brane of the Eustachian tube and the upper part of the pharynx. Some small nasal arteries are furnished to the roof of the nasal ^^teries''^^'^^ fossa by the posterior ethmoidal branch of the ophthalmic (p. 46). Also the anterior ethmoidal (internal nasal; p. 46) enters the cavity with the nasal nerve, and ramifies in the lining membrane of the fore part of the nasal chamber as low as the vestibule : a branch L

263 INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. iiing very obliquely downwards and forwards, while those of the internal j^ass, although less obliquely, downwards and backwards. The external muscle consists of fleshy and tendinous fibres, and is Outer layer attached to the margins of the ribs bounding the intercostal space, in front. It extends from the tubercle of the upper rib behind to the end of the bone in front, except in the last two spaces, where the muscle is continued forwards l)etween the cartilages. A thin membrane {anterior intercostal a2)oneurosis) takes the place of the muscle between the rib-cartilages. Dissection. The internal intercostal muscle will be seen by cutting Dissection through and removing the external layer and the fascia in one of the musSr^ widest spaces, say the second. Far back between the tw(j muscles, and close to tlie rib above, the of nerves intercostal nerve and vessels will be found. A branch of the nerve vessels, to the surface (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be followed through the external muscle ; and the trunk of the nerve is to be traced forwards in one or more spaces to the sternum and the sur- face of the chest. The hinder part of the muscles will be seen in the dissection of the back and thorax. The internal intercostal muscle is attached to the inner surface of inner layer the ribs bounding the space. It begins near the angles of the ribs behind, behind, the upper muscles approaching more closely to the spine than the lower ones, and reaches to the extremity of the intercostal space in front. The fibres of the lowest two muscles are continuous anteriorly with those of the internal oblique of the abdomen. One surface is in contact with tlie external muscle, and the intercostal vessels and nerves ; and the other is lined by the pleura. Action. By the action of the intercostal muscles the ribs are Use of moved in respiration. The external intercostals elevate the ribs and evert the lower edges, ^^^^t^"^, niuscl6s' so as to enlarge the thorax in the antero-j^osterior and transverse directions : they come into play during inspiration. The internal intercostals act in a different Avay at the side and fore ^'^'1^^' muscles, part of the chest. Between the osseous parts of the ribs they depress and turn in jj^^jr^^*^^^^^"^ those bones, diminishing the size of the thorax ; and they are brought into use in expiration. Between the rib-cartilages they raise the ribs, and are muscles intercarti- of inspiration, like the outer layer. iwt!^"*' Dissection. To bring into view the triangularis sterni muscle and Dissection the internal mammary vessels, the cartilages of the true ribs, except J*4mmary the first and seventh, are to be taken away with the intervening vessels, muscles on the right side ; * but the two ribs mentioned are to be left untouched for the benefit of the dissectors of the abdomen and of the head and neck. Small arteries to each intercostal space and the surface of the thorax, and the intercostal nerves are to be preserved. * On the left side the vessels and the muscles may have been destroyed by the injection of the body.

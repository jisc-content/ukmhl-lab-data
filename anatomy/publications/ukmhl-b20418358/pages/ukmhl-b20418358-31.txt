NEEYES IN BASE OF SKULL. 17 sinus ; and to see them, it will be necessary to trace tliem tlirougli the dura mater towards the orbit. Afterwards the student should follow outwards the roots of the of fiftii fifth nerve into the middle fossa of the skull, as in fig. 4, taking away the dura mater from them, and from the surface of the large Gasserian ganglion which lies on the fore part of the petrous portion of the temporal Ijone. From the front of the ganglion arise two other large trunks besides the ophthalmic, viz., superior and inferior maxillary, and these should also be traced to their apertures of exit from the skull. If the dura mater is removed entirely from the bone near the nerves a better view will be obtained. The THIRD or oculomotor nerve (fig. 5, ^) is destined for the Third nerve muscles of the orbit. It enters the wall of the cavernous sinus near the anterior clinoid process, and is placed at first above the other nerves ; but when it is about to enter the orbit through the Cranial nerves in the base of the skull. On the left side the dura mater has been removed from the middle fossa to show the nerves in the wall of the cavernous sinus, the Oasserian ganglion,, and the three trunks of the fifth nerve. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Second to sixth nerves. 7. Facial and auditory. 8. Glosso-iDharyngeal, vagus and spinal accessory. 9. Hypoglossal. On the right side the dura mater is untouched, f Offset to the tentorium from the ophthalmic nerve. C

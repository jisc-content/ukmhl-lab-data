259 AXILLARY VEIN. The subscapular branch (fig. 84, c) courses with a nerve of the Subscapular same name along the subscapularis, as far as the lower angle of the scapula, where it ends in branches for the serratus magnus, latissimus clorsi, and teres major muscles ; it gives many oftsets to the glands of the space. Near its origin the artery sends backwards a considerable dorsal a dorsal branch round the edge of the subscapular muscle : this gives an infrascapiilar offset to the ventral aspect of the scapula, and then which give turns to the dorsum of that bone, where it will be afterwards dis- ^"^1'^- ° sected (p. 274). ^^^f^^^^' The subscapular artery is frequently combined at its origin with other branches of the axillary, or with branches of the brachial artery. The circumflex branches wind round the humerus below the sub- Anterior Bcapular muscle. The anterior is small, and passes outwards beneath posterior the coraco-brachialis and biceps. The posterior is much larger, and circumflex, disappears with the companion nerve between the subscapularis and teres major muscles. They will be followed in the dissection of the shoulder (p. 269). Small muscular offsets enter the coraco-brachialis muscle. Muscular. The AXILLARY VEIN ((/) continues upwards the basilic vein of the Axillary arm, and has the same extent as the axillary artery. It lies to the ^^^^ • thoracic side of its artery, and receives corresponding thoracic and yeiations^-^ shoulder branches. Opj^osite the subscapular muscle it is joined branches.' externally by a large vein, which is formed by the imion of the venfB comites of the brachial artery ; and near the clavicle the cephalic vein opens into it. Dissection. To follow out the branches of the brachial plexus, cut Dissection through the pectoralis minor near its insertion into the coracoid piexus^.^^*^ process, and turn it towards the chest, but without injuring the thoracic nerves. The axillary vessels are next to be divided below the second rib,* and to be drawn down with hooks ; and their thoracic branches may be removed at the same time. A dense fascia is to be cleared away from the large nerves of tlie plexus. The BRACHIAL PLEXUS (fig. 85) results from the interlacement of Nerves the anterior branches of the lower four cervical nerves and the ^rach^l larger part of the first dorsal; and a slip is added to it above from plexus, the lowest nerve in the cervical plexus. It is placed successively situation in the neck and the axilla, and ends opposite the coracoid process in the nerves of the limb. The part of the plexus above the clavicle is described in the dissection of the head and neck (p. 72). The andrela- part below the clavicle has the same relations to surrounding muscles as the axillary artery ; and in it the nerve-trunks are disposed as follows :— As the plexus enters the axilla it consists of three cords, inner. The nerves outer, and posterior, which lie together in a bundle on the outer side coi™g*^^^® of the artery. Beneath the pectoralis minor the three cords embrace around the ^ ^ artery, *" The student must be careful not to cut the vessels higher than the spot jnentioned, otherwise he will injure the dissection of the neck. s 2

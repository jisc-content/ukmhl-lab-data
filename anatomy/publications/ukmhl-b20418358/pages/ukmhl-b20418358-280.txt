dissectiotn of the upper limb. 266 SeCTIOJn' 11. SCAPULAR MUSCLES, VESSELS, NERVES, AND LIGAMENTS. Position. Dissection of mnscles. Positicn. After tlie limb has been separated from the trunk it is to be placed with the subscapularis uppermost. Dissection. The different muscles that have been, traced to the scapula in the dissection of the front of the chest and of the back are now to be followed to their insertion into the bone. A small part of each, about an inch in length, should be left for the purpose of showinjx the attachment. Muscles attached to upper margin of the scapuls to axillary margin, and to base the base of the scapula, run the posterior scapular artery and vein, the ramifications of Fig. 88.* which are to be traced. To the borders and the angles of the scapula the following muscles are connected :â€” From the ui^per margin of the scapula arises one muscle, the omo-hyoid (fig. 88, e). About half an inch wide at its origin, the muscle is attached to the edge of the bone behiiid the notch, and sometimes to the liga- ment which bridges over the notch. Along the axillary margin arise the long head of the triceps (fig. 94, a), and the teres minor (h) and major (g) muscles ; these attachments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The vertebral border of the bone has four muscles inserted into it. Between the superior angle and the spine is the levator anguli scapulae (fig. 89, h) ; opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor (j) is attached ; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major (k) is inserted : the upper fibres of the last * View of the subscapularis and the surrounding muscles.

DISSECTIOX OF THE NECK. 180 Dissection. Dissection. For the examination of tlie liganients of the sterno- claviciiLar articulation, take the piece of the bones that was set aside for the purpose. If the ligaments have become dry, they may be moistened for a short time. The several ligaments will be seen in tlie situation indicated by their names, after the removal of some connective tissue. Fibrous The Capsular ligament (tig. 54, ^) is a stout membrane surrounding tlie articular portions of the Ijones and the fibro-cartilage. Its fibres run oliliquely from the clavicle downwards and inwards to the Inter- clavicuhir. and costd clavicular ligament. sternum. The stronger parts in front and behind are described a.s the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaments. The inttrclavicular ligament (fig. 54, ^) extends above the sternum, between the ends of the clavicles. The fibres dip into the hollow between the collar-bones, and are connected with the upper edge of the sternum. The costo-claricular or rltomhoid. ligament (hg. 54, ") is a short strong band of oblicpie fibres, passing from the upper surface of the cartilage of the l^irst rib to a rough mark on the under surface of the clavicle near the sternal end. In front of the ligament is the origin of the subclavius muscle. Sometimes the ligament is liollow, and contains a svnovial bursa. ■"■ Ligaments of the inner end of tlie clavicle, and of the cartilage of the second rib, 1. Capsule. 2. Costo-clavicular ligament. 3.

The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal Dissection, bones on each side are next to l)e dissected out by taking away the small mii'^cles of the thumb and little finger. Before reading its Fig. 100.*- Fig. 101. t descri2)tion, the ends of the cut ligament may be placed in appo- sition, and fixed with a stitch. The ANTERIOR ANNULAR LIGAMENT is a broad band, which arches Annular over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is I'S'^int-iit , ^ ot front attached internally to the pisiform and unciform bones, and ex- of wrist, ternally to the ttiberosity of the scaphoid and the ridge of the trapezium, as well as by a deeper process to the trapezoid bone on the inner side -of the groove for the flexor carpi raclialis. By its upper border it is continuous with the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and on its anterior surface it is joined by the palmar fascia. Over it lie the palmaris longus tendon and the ulnar vessels and nerve. Dissection. Next follow the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis Dissection, to its insertion into the metacarpal bones, by dividing the overlying â€¢ ] )art of the anterior ligament. The. tendon of the jiexor carpi radialis, in passing from the fore-insertion of arm to the hand, lies in the groove in the trapezium between the faSis'?'^'' attachments of the annular ligament, but outside the arch of that band ; here it is bound down by a fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane. The tendon is inserted into the base of the metacarx>al bone of the index finger, and sends a slip to that of the middle digit. The three palmar interosseous inuscle,s. a.

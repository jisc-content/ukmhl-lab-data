DISSECTION OF THE AEM. 282 triceps muscle : one of the offsets forms an arcli across the back of the hnmerns with a branch of the superior profunda. In front of the elbow-joint the anastomotic branch sends an offset to the pronator teres muscle ; this joins the anterior ulnar recurrent branch. Veins end ill The BRACHIAL VEINS (fig. 93, (7) accompau}'the artery, Dne on the axillary. ^^^^ ^.^^^ ^^^^-^ ^^.^^^^ branches of communication across that vessel; thev receive tributary veins corresponding to the branches of the artery. Above, they usually join into one, which enters the axillary vein near the subscapular muscle. Fig. 93.* Nerves on front of arm. Median nerve with tlie artery, has not any branch. Nerves of the arm (fig. 93). The nerves on the front of the arm are derived from the terminal cords of the bracliial plexus. They furnish but few offsets above the elbow, being for the most part continued to the forearm and the hand. The cutaneous branches of some of them have been already referred to (j). 277). The MEDIAN NERVE (^) arises from the brachial plexus by two heads, one from the outer, and the other from the inner cord (p. 261), and accompanies the brachial artery to the forearm. Beginning on the outer side of the artery, the nerve crosses over, or less frequently under, it below the middle of the arm, and is placed on the inner side a little above the elbow. It does not give any branch in the arm : but there mav be a fasciculus connecting it * Dissection of the inner side of the arm. (Ilhistrations of Dissections.) Muscles: a. Pectoralis major, b.

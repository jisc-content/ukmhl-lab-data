63 ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. 111 close contact with the outer side of both the common and the Jugular internal carotid artery, and encased in a sheath of fascia with them, ^'^"^"' is the large internal jugular vein, which receives branches in the neck corresponding to some of the branches of the superficial artery. In some bodies the vein covers the artery ; and the branches joining it position above may form a kind of plexus over the upper end of the common carotid, Nerves in the space. In connection with the large vessels are the Nerves with following nerves with a longitudinal direction :—^On the surface of ^^tenes, the common carotid artery, and most frequently within the sheath, lies the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve ; between the artery and jugular vein is the pneumo-gastric nerve ; and behind the lying along sheath is the sympathetic nerve. Along the outer side of the vessels the spinal accessory nerve extends for a short distance, until it pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle. Several nerves are placed across the vessels :—thus, directed ^"gj^"'*^^^^"^ transversely over the two carotids, so as to form an arch below the digastric muscle, is the hypoglossal nerve giving off its descending branch. Appearing on the inner side of the carotid arteries, close to the base of the space, is the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which courses forwards between them. To the inner side of the internal carotid artery, opposite the hyoid bone, the superior laryngeal nerve comes into sight; while a little lower down, with the descending branches of the thyroid artery, is the external larjaigeal branch of that nerve. Glands in the space. Two large glandular bodies, the siibmaxil- _fubniaxil- lary(fig. 17,^\) and thyroid (^^), have their seat in this triangular lary, t>pace of the neck. The submaxillary gland is placed altogether in front of the vessels, and is partly concealed by the jaw : beneath it, on the surface of the mylo-hyoid, is the small nerve to that muscle, with the submental artery. By the side of the thyroid cartilage, 'J^Jly^^^™^'^ between it and the common carotid artery, lies the thyroid body beneath the sterno-thyroid muscle : in the female this body is more largely developed than in the male. At the base of the space, if the parts were not disturbed, would Parotid be the parotid gland, which is wedged into the hollow between the ^ jaw and the mastoid process, and projects somewhat below the level of the jaw. Its relations have been noticed at p. 28. Several lymphatic glands, belonging to the deep cervical group, Lymphatic lie along the internal jugular vein, under cover of the sterno- gi'"«^s- mastoid muscle ; and another set of smaller glands {submaxillary hjm'phatic glands) is placed below the base of the jaw. Directions. The student has to proceed next with the examina- tion of the individual parts that have been referred to in the triangular spaces. Anterior jugular vein. This vein lies near the middle line A^^^^^^^^^^^.^jj^ of the neck, and its size is dependent upon the degree of develop- •'""^ ment of the external jugular. Beginning in some small branches below the chin, the vein descends to the sternum, and then bends outwards beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, to open into the external

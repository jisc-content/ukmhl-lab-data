564 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Lateral sacral arteries supply spinal branches. Gluteal artery: The ilio-lumhar vein opens into tlie common iliac trunk. The lateral sacral arteries (fig. 183, i) are commonly two in number, superior and inferior : they correspond in situation with the lumbar arteries, and form a chain of anastomoses by the side of the apertures in the sacrum. These arteries supply the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles, and anastomose with each other, as well as with the middle sacral. A spinal branch enters each aperture in the sacrum. The gluteal artery (fig. 183, m) is the continuation of the posterior division of the internal iliac, and is destined for the gluteal muscles on the outer surface of the hip-bone. It is a short, thick trunk, which leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, above the pyriformis muscle, with its accompanying vein and the superior gluteal nerve. In the pelvis the artery gives small tranches to the contiguous muscles, viz., iliacus, pyriformis, and obturator, and a twig to the hip-bone. * Dissection of the internal iliac artery (Tiedemann).

13 VEXOUS SINUSES OF CEANIUM. cerebelli the attaclied edge are the lateral and superior petrosal sinuses on each side. The falx cerebelli has a corresponding position below the tentorium Faix to the falx cerebri above that fold. It is much smaller than the falx of the cerebrum, and will appear on detaching the tentorium. Triangular in form, this fold is adherent to the internal occipital crest, and projects between the hemispheres of the small brain. Its base is directed to the tentorium ; and the apex reaches the foramen contains magnum, on each side of which it gives a small slip. In it is gfuu^l^^^ contained the occipital sinus. The SINUSES are channels for venous blood between the layers Sinuses of of the dura mater. They are arranged in two groups, the one comprising the sinuses that converge towards the internal occipital protuberance, while the other is formed by the cavernous sinuses on the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone and the canals opening into these. A. The superior longitudinal sinus has been described at p. 10. Superior The INFERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS (fig. 3, c) resembles a ^^,^^^^^,1^^^. vein, and is contained in the lower border of the falx cerebri at the gitudinai. posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and the large brain, and ends in the straight sinus {d) at the edge of the tentorium. The STRAIGHT SINUS (fig. 3, d) lies along the junction of the falx Straight with the tentorium, extending from the termination of the preceding sinus to the internal occipital protuberance, where it is continued into one of the lateral sinnses, generally tlie left. Its form is triangular, like the superior longitudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of Some of the venous sinuses of the skull, a.

723 SCLEROTIC COAT. Fibrous Coat of the Eyeball. The outer casing of the eye Fibrous consists of an opac^ue hinder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior transparent portion, the cornea. The sclerotic is the firm, whitish, opaque portion of the outer Sclerotic coat of the eyeball, which supports the more delicate structures within. Dissection.

The other structures may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 234, a) extends from the Extent of entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming sclerotic; above five-sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one-tenth apertures of an inch), the optic nerve (l) is transmitted through an aperture in it: this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cribriform when the nerve is drawn out,â€”the lattice-like condition being due to the bundles of fibrous tissue between the funiculi of * Diagram of a horizontal section of the eyeball. a.

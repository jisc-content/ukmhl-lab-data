SYMPATHETIC NERVE. the plexus, especially at the points of union of the spinal and sympathetic nerves. Offsets. From each plexus offsets are furnished along the branches offsets to of the internal iliac artery to the viscera of the pelvis, and the genital of the^nmie organs : these form secondary plexuses, and have the same name as viz., the vessels on which they are placed. The inferior hemorrhoidal plexus is an offset from the hack of ^'^ ^}^^ 111 T • 1 1-1 • rectum; the plexus to the rectum, and joms the sympathetic on the superior ha3morrhoidal artery (p. 489). l^h.Q vesical plexus contains large offsets, with manv white-fibred to tiie or spinal nerves, and passes forwards to the side and neck of the bladder. It gives one plexus to the vesicula seminalis, and another to the vas deferens. The prostatic plexus leaves the front of the pelvic plexus, and g^^^p^j^,^^*" supplies the substance of the j)rostate. At the front of the j)rostate penis': an offset (cavernous) is continued onwards to the dorsum of the penis, to supply the cavernous structure. On the penis tlie cavernous nerves join the pudic nerve. In the female there are the following additional plexuses for the offsets in supply of the viscera peculiar to that sex :— ^ '^'"'^ '' Ovarian plexus. The chief nerves to the ovary are derived from to the the renal and aortic plexuses (p. 489), and accompany the artery ' of that body ; but the uterine nerves supply some filaments to it. Vaqinal nerves. The nerves of the vajrina are large, and are not to tiie plexiform, but consist in greater part of spinal nerve-fibres ; they end in the lower part of the tube. The uterine nerves are furnished to the uterus with only a small '^^^^^^ admixture of the spinal nerves : they ascend along the side of the uterus, and consist of long slender filaments without ganglia or com- munications. The Fallopian tube receives its branches from the uterine nerves. Some few nerves surrounding the arteries of the uterus are plexi- form and ganglionic. The LYMPHATIC GLANDS OF THE PELVIS fomi oue chain ill front ^j'^^i^^^^!':' of the sacrum, and another along the internal iliac vessels : their efferent ducts join the lumbar glands. Into these glands the deep ]yiiij)hatics of the penis, those of the genital organs in the female, lymphatics and the lymphatics of the viscera and wall of the pelvis are col- them. ° lected.

The bladder and the bodies at its base, viz., the vesicula? seminales, and the prostate gland, are to be taken first for examina- tion.

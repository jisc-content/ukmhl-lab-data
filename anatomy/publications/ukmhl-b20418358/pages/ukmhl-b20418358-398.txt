The liqamenta suhflava are small li^'aiueiits ot ^ the lamiuw: rhomboidal sheets of yellow elastic tissue, which close the intervals between the neural arches at the back of the spinal canal from, the axis to the sacrum. In each interval there are two ligaments, a extent; right and a left, which meet in the middle line, and extend from attacli- incnts: thickness. Ligaments i)f spines: supraspi- nous ; ami inter- spi nous. the root of the spine to the articular j^i'ocesses. Tliey are attached above to the anterior or deep surface of the laminse of one vertebra, and below to the upper border and posterior surface of the laminae of the next. They are thin in the neck, and strongest in the loins. Ligaments of the spines. Along the tips of the spinous j^rocesses of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrse is a longitudinal band of fibres (fig. 129, ^)â€”the siq^raspinotis ligament. It is thickest in the lumbar region ; and it consists of superficial fibres which pass over three or more spines, and deep fibres which unite adjoining bones. Many of the back muscles arise from it on each side. In the same regions there are also membranous intersjpinous ligaments (fig. 122, ^) reaching from the root to the tip of the spinous processes. They are thicker and broader in the lumbar than in the dorsal part of the column. * An inner view of the nenral arches of the vertebrse, with their interposed ligaments. (Bourgery.) 1 and 2.

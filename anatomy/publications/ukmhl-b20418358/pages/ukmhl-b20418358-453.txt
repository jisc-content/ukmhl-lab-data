ANTERIOR HALF IN FEMALE. 439 Fie-. 14/ superficial fascia are then to be looked' to, and tlie cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be traced beneath it (p. 428). Supei-ficial fascia. The description of this fascia in the male will serve for the like part in the female, with these modili cations :—• tliat in the female it is interrupted in the middle line, and is of less extent, in consequence of the aperture of the vulva ; and that it is continued forwards through the labia majora to the inguinal region. In the labia the superficial fascia contains involuntary muscular fil)res, like the dartos tunic of the scrotum, as well as fat. The SUPERFICIAL PERINEAL VESSELS and NERVES, and the INFERIOR PUDENDAL NERVE liave the Same arrangement as in the male (p. 430) ; but they are distributed to the labia instead of to the scrotum. Dissection. The labia and the superficial fascia are to be removed, to follow the sphincter muscle around the opening of the vagina. Two other muscles are exposed at the same time, viz., the erector clitoridis lying along the ramus of the ischium, and the trans- versus perinei passing across the perineum to tlie central point. The SPHINCTER VA- GINAE (bulbo-caverno- sus ; fig. 147, a) is an orbicular muscle around the orifice of the vagina, and corre- sponds to the ejacu- lator urinae in, the male. Posteriorlyit is attached to the central point of the perineum, where it Ijlends with the sphincter ani and transversus muscles ; and its fibres are directed forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the body of the clitoris. The muscle covers the bulb of the vestibule and the gland of Bartholin by the side of the entrance to the vagina. Action. Like the other orbicular muscles, the sphincter diminishes that part of the vagina which it encircles ; and it assists in fixing the centi-al point of the perineum. The ERECTOR CLITORIDIS (ischio-cavernosus) resembles the erector of the penis in the male, though it is much smaller (p. 431). The TRANSVERSUS PERINEI is similar to the muscle of the same name in the male. The one description will suffice for the muscle in both sexes (p. 432).

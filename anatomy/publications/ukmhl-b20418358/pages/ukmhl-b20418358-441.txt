This muscle will be more fully seen in the dissection of the pelvis (p. 549). Arteries (lig, 143). The pudic artery, with its inferior hsemor- Arteries of rhoidal branch, and other small offsets of it, are now visible. The INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY («) is derived from the internal Pndic iliac in the pelvis (p. 565), and in its course to the genital organs ^^^^^"J" = distributes offsets to the perineum ; one portion will be laid bare m course: the posterior, and the other in the anterior half of the perineum. As now seen, the vessel enters the hinder part of the ischio-rectal posterior fossa, and courses forwards along the outer wall at the depth of one fos^gV^ inch and a half behind, but of only half an inch in front. It is depth and contained in an aponeurotic sheath formed by the obturator fascia, relations. The usual companion veins lie by its side ; and two nerves accom- pany it, viz., the dorsal nerve of the penis which is abo^ e it, and the perineal branch of tlie pudic nerve which is nearer the surface. Its Branches:— offsets in this part of its course are the following:— The inferior hcemorrJioidal branch (/>) arises as the artery enters inferior the ischio-rectal fossa, and is directed inwards across the space to Ij^i"^^^'''*^"': the anus, dividing into branches which supply the skin and fat, the ' ' levator ani and sphincter muscles, and the lower end of the rectum. On the gut it anastomoses with the other liEemorrhoidal arteries. In a well injected body cutaneous branches may be seen to run forwards to the anterior part of the perineum, and to communicate with the superficial perineal artery. Other offsets {c) turn upwards round the edge of the gluteus maximus to the integument of the lower and inner part of the buttock. Small muscular hranches cross the front of the iscliio-rectal fossa, '"^jj^^^^"^'"" and supply the anterior part of the levator ani muscle. J^eins accompany the arteries, and have a like course and ramifi- Veins, cation : the pudic veins end in the internal iliac. Nerves (fig. 143). The nerves seen at this stage of the dissec- Nerves of tion are the three divisions of the pudic trunk, a branch of the ^^^^ ^r^ice. fourth sacral nerve, and the perforating cutaneous offset of the sacral plexus. The PUDIC NERVE is derived from the sacral plexus, and lies over Pndic nerve the small sacro-sciatic ligament with the artery in the buttock ?ire!>^paJ-t^I (p. 647). In the small sacro-sciatic foramen the nerve breaks up into the three following branches, which enter the perineum :— The inferior hcemorrlioidal branch crosses the ischio-rectal fossa, inferior and reaches the margin of the anus, where it terminates in offsets to dja" the integument and the sphincter muscle. Other cutaneous offsets of the nerve run forwards over the fossa, and communicate with one of the superficial perineal nerves, and with the inferior pudendal (of the small sciatic) on the margin of the thigh. ,[ The perineal branch is the largest of the three divisions, and runs perineal; : ■ forwards in a sheath of the obturator fascia, lying below the pudic vessels. At the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa it divides into j cutaneous, muscular, and genital offsets. Its two cutaneous branches ; : ■

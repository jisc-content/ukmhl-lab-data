CRICO-THYEOID MUSCLE. 157 Along the side, between the thyroid and cricoid cartihiges, the of t^^s. crico-thyroid muscle (fig. 42) will be lecognised. muJcies!^^ To denude the posterior muscles (fig. 43), it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane covering it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle ; and above this, on the back of the arytenoid cartilages, the arytenoid muscle will api)ear, with Fi?. 42. Fig. 43. t the crossing fasciculi of the aryteno-ejDiglottidean muscles on its surface. The CRico-THYROiD MUSCLE (fig. 42,^) is fan-shaped, and is Crico- separated by a triangular interval from the one on the opposite side. It arises from the front and the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage ; origin; and its fibres radiate to be inserted into the lower cornu, and the insertion; lower border of the thyroid cartilage as far forwards as a quarter of an inch from the middle line; as well as for a short distance into the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the crico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid muscle. Action. It draws the cricoid cartilage upwards and backwards, so use. as to increase the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, and thus tightens the vocal cords.

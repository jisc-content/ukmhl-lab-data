THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. 420 White The white substance of the cord is composed cliiefly of meduUated snbstance. nei've-fibres disposed in longitudinal bundles, which are enclosed by- irregular septa of connective tissue prolonged from the pia mater on the surface. Three larger processes of the pia mater extend into the back of the cord ; these are the posterior median septum already referred to, and the posterior intermediate septum on each side, which passes forwards in the cervical region from the furrow of the same name, and separates the posterior median and postero-external columns.

The grey substance is least in amount in the dorsal region. The cornua of the grey crescents decrease in length from above down, especially the jDosterior, and towards the end of the cord they blend in. one indented or cruciform mass. Intraspinal Vessels. Arteries supply the cord and its mem- branes, and the bodies of the vertebrte. The veins form a remark- able plexus within the canal, but this Avill not be seen unless they have been specially injected. The intraspinal arteries (fig. 141, a) are derived from the vessels along the sides and front of the spinal column, viz., from the vertebral and ascending cervical in the neck, from the intercostal in * Intraspinal arteries in the loins, a.

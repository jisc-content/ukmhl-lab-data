627 EXTERNAL CIECUMFLEX ARTERY. Action. All parts of the quadriceps extend the knee-joint when Use with the tibia is moveable ; and the rectus can flex the hip-joint over able^"^*^^^" which it passes. The fleshy bellies are strong enough to break the patella transversely over the end of the femur, or to rupture some- times the common tendon. With the tibia as the fixed point the vasti will bring forwards the with tibia femur, and straighten the knee, as in rising from the stooping ^^^^ * posture and jumping ; and the rectus will prop the pelvis on the femur, or assist in moving it forwards in stoo|)ing. The subcrureus'draws upwards the pouch of synovial mem-howsub- brane above the patella in extension of the knee. acts.^^^*' Intermuscular septa. The processes of the fascia lata, which intermus- limit laterally the, extensor muscle of the knee, are thus named, and ^^^^^^ ^^^^^ are fixed to the linea aspera and the lines leading to the condyles of are two: the femur. The external septum is the stronger, and reaches from the insertion the outer of the gluteus maximus to the outer condyle of the femur. It is stronger; situate between the vastus externus and crureus on the one side, and the short head of the biceps on the other, to all of which it gives origin : it is perforated near the outer condyle by the upper external articular vessels and nerve. The inner imrtition is very thin along the side of the vastus the inner is internus ; and its jjlace is supplied by the strong tendon of i^*^^^^tmct. the adductor magnus between the inner condyle and the linea iispera. The EXTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (fig. 203, is the chief vessel External for the supply of the muscles of the front of the thigh. It arises ^|.^y^!y^^'^^ usually from the outer side of the jjrofunda (deep femoral) artery, but often from the femoral trunk. It is directed outwards through the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and beneath the sartorius divides and rectus muscles, and supplies oftsets to those muscles. Its terminal "^^^ branches are ascending, transverse, and descending:— The ascending branch is directed beneath the tensor vagince ascending, femoris to the outer side of the hip, where it anastomoses with the gluteal artery, and supplies the contiguous muscles. The trarisverse branch, the smallest, divides into two or three transverse, which enter the vastus externus, and anastomose with the per- forating arteries. The descending branch is the largest, and ends in pieces which are and de- distributed to the crureus and vastus externus muscles. One con- JJanciiel ■siderable branch descends to the knee, and anastomoses with the upper external articular artery; a small offset courses over the muscle with a nerve to the joint. The ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE (fig. 203, ^) of the lumbar plexus Anterior (p. 542) supplies the muscles, and most of the integuments of the crural nerve front of the thigh, and the integuments of the inner side of the leg. Soon after the trunk of the nerve leaves the abdomen it is is divided, flattened, and is divided into superficial and deep pieces. A. The superficial part gives off the middle and internal cutaneous From its -nerves, and branches to the sartorius and pectineus muscles. part arise— s s 2

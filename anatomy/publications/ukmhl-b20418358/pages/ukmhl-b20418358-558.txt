DISSECTION OF THE ABDOxMEN. 544 the wall of the aMoineii. The veins resemble the arteries, and open into the cava; left longer. A plexus around the transverse l^rocesses. Orif^in of azygos entrance into thorax. the posterior part of the abdominal wall, where they are distributed (p. 459). The first lies with the last dorsal nerve across the front of the qnadratns lumbornm, but the others usually pass behind that muscle. Offsets are furnished to the psoas and quadratus muscles, and to the subperitoneal fat; the last anastomose witli branches of the renal, capsular, spermatic, right and left colic, and some other visceral arteries. The LUMBAR VEINS are the same in number, and have the same course as the arteries. Commencing by the union of a dorsal and an abdominal branch at the root of the transverse process, each trunk is directed forwards to the vena cava. They o]3en into the back of the cava, either singly, or conjointly with those of the opposite side. On the left side the veins are longer than on the right, and j)ass beneath the aorta. Around the transverse processes, and beneath the ]3soas muscles, the lumbar veins communicate freely with one another, with the ilio-lumbar, and with the common iliac, so as to form a plexus of veins. Issuing above from the plexus is a branch, the ascending lumhar vein, which joins the azygos vein of the corresponding side of the body. Beginning of the azygos veins each side above the first lumbar vertebra by the above-mentioned ascending lumbar vein ; and it is often joined by a branch of com- munication with the inferior cava or the renal vein. The right vein enters the thorax usually with the tlioracic duct and the aorta, to the right of which it lies. The left vein passes through the pillar of the diaphragm, or sometimes through the aortic opening. The anatomy of these veins is given at p. 371. The azygos vein begins on

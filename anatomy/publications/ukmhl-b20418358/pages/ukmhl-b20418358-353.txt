339 THE MEDIASTINUM. together. The partition is artificially divided into four parts, which are distinguished as the superior, anterior, middle, and posterior mediastina. The superior mcdiastimtm is the portion of the septum above the Superior pericardium, and may be defined as bounded below by a plane thmm^:^ extending; from the lower border of the body of the fourth dorsal boundaries, vertebra to the junction of the manubrium and body of the sternum. It is limited in front by the manubrium with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and behind by the upper four dorsal vertebrae and the lower ends of the longi colli muscles. Between the pleura3 in this part there are found, proceeding from and before backwards, the following objects,—the remains of the thymus contents, gland, several lymphatic glands, the innominate veins and the upper half of the superior cava, the phrenic and pneumo-gastric nerves, the arch of the aorta with its three large branches, innominate, left carotid and left subclavian, the trachea, oesophagus and thoracic duct, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The anterior mediastinum, is the part in front of the jDericardium, '^^^^^'^^V and is very narrow in its upper half, since the two pleurae meet num is the behind the sternum from the level of the second to the fourth smallest: costal cartilages. Below the latter spot the left pleura inclines away irom the middle line, and is separated from its fellow by an interval in which the pericardium comes into contact with the sternum and the left triangularis sterni muscle. The anterior mediastinum contents, contains only sohie areolar tissue with a few small lymphatic glands. In some bodies the left pleura is continued behind the sternum nearly as far as the diajDhragm. The middle mediastinum is the largest part of the septum, and Middle me- includes the pericardium with the contained heart and great vessels, contents, viz., the ascending aorta, the trunk of the pulmonary artery, and the lower half of the superior vena cava ; also the phrenic nerves, the roots of the lungs with the bronchial lymphatic glands, and on the right side the arch of the azygos vein. The posterior mediastinum is the portion between the pericardium Posterior and the spine ; and the interpleural space is here larger than in ifn^niT front of the heart. Its extent and contents will be shewn by dividing the jDleura on the right side behind the root of the lung, boundaries, Enclosed between the serous layers of the posterior mediastinum and con- are the descending thoracic aorta, the azygos veins, the oesophagus with the pneumo-gastric nerves, and the tlioracic duct, as well as a set of lymphatic glands. Dissection. The pleura and the fat are now to be cleaned from clean peri- ,^ . T p . 1 . T cardium and the Side oi the pericardium. The root of the luno- is to be dissected out by taking away the the root of pleura and the areolar tissue from the front and back, without in- juring its component vessels. In this dissection the phrenic nerve Trace the and artery will be found in front of the root, together with a few ''^'"'''^^ small anterior pulmonary nerves ; the last are best seen on the left side. Behind the root of the lung is the vagus nerve, dividing into branches ; and arching above the right one is the large azygos vein. ^"•1/'^^°''^ z 2

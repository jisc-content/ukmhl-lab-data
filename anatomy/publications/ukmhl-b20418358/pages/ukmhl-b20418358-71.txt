BEANCHES OF CERVICAL PLEXUS. 57 The subclavian vein occasionally rises upwards as high, as the Position of artery ; or in some rare instances, it even lies with the artery beneath the anterior scalenus. The position of the external jugular vein M ith regard to the subclavian artery is very uncertain; and the branches connected with its lower end often form a kind of plexus over the arterial trunk. The occipital part of the posterior triangle is larger than the Occipital other. Its Ijoundaries in front and behind are the sterno-mastoid space^^ and the trapezius; and it is separated from the clavicular portion by the omo hyoid muscle. In it are contained chiefly the ramifications of the cervical j^^g^^^g^^j^^^ plexus ; and a chain of lymphatic glands lies along the sterno- lymphatics; mastoid muscle. The spinal accessory nerve Q^) is directed also spinal obliquely across this interval from the sterno-mastoid muscle, which nerve!*^^^ it pierces, to the under surface of the trapezius ; and a communica- tion takes place between it and the spinal nerves in the space. Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus. These ^h/gp^yigai nerves emerge from beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle about the plexus middle of its hinder border, and are thence directed both upwards and downwards. The ASCENDING SET (fig. 15) are three in number, viz., small t^^t ascend, occipital, great auricular, and superficial cervical. The small occipital branch (fig. 2, ^) conies from the second, and Small in most cases also from the third cervical nerves, and is directed upwards to the head along the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid muscle. It perforates the fascia near the skull, and is dis- tributed between the ear and the great occipital nerve (p. 8). Occasionally there is a second cutaneous nerve to the back of the head. The great auricular nerve (fig. 2, ^) is derived from the second Great and third cervical nerves. Perforating the deep fascia at the pos- terior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the nerve is directed upwards beneath the platysma towards the lobule of the ear, and ends in the following branches :— The facial hranches are sent forwards to the integuments over the supplies j^arotid, and a few slender filaments pass into the gland to join the ' facial nerve. ■ The auricular hranches ascend to the external ear, and are chiefly auricular, distributed on its cranial aspect, but one or more reach the lower part of the outer surface. On the ear they communicate with branches furnished from the facial and pneumo-gastric nerves. The mastoid branch is directed backwards to the skin over the ^^^^"j^|g^"'^ mastoid process, where it joins the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve (p. 37). The superficial cervical nerve (fig. 2, arises from the cervical ^^Pfj^^f^^^ plexus in common with the preceding, and turns forwards round nerve. the sterno-mastoid muscle about the middle. Afterwards it pierces the fascia, and ramifies over the anterior triangular space (see p. 59). There may be more than one branch to represent this nerve. , The DESCENDING SET of branches (fig. 2) are derived from the Nerves that .... . , . . descend are

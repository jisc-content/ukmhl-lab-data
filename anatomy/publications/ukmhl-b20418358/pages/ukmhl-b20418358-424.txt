CHAPTER \L THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. (Jurd is coil- The spinal cortl (iiiediilla spinalis) gives origin to the spinal .spinal canal nerves, and is lodged in tlie canal Ijounded hj the "Ijodies and im-ested hy iieural ai'ches of tlie vertebra3. It is invested hy prolongations of iiicnibraiH s. ^-j^g membranes of the brain, which foi'ni slieatlis aiound and support it. Dissection Dissedion. After all the mnsclcs liave been taken from the the corli arches and spines of the vertebra}, the s])inal canal is to l)e opened by sawing through the laminee on each side, close to the articular processes ; and the cuts of tlie savv' should extend to the lower end of the sacrum, but not higher in the neck than the fourth cer^'ical vertebra. As it is difficult to use tiie saw in tlie hollow of the lumbar region, a chisel and a mallet will be found useful to complete the division of the neural arches, and tlic The tube of the dura mater is covered by some A cins and fat, nicnibiancs. .^^^j y^^. ^ Iqqc^q areolar tissue containing fluid sometimes, especially at the lower part. The fat may be scraped away Avith the handle of the scalpel ; and the lateral 2)rolongations of the membrane through the interverteljral foramina are to be defined. si>inai Membranes of the Cord (fig. 136). Three membranes, like aic'thrcc ill f^^^^^ on the brain, surround the cord, viz., an external tube of nnnibcr. dura mater, an internal covering of pia mater, and an intermediate sheath of arachnoid. Dnra mater The DURA MATER (Â«) is the strongest tube, and is continuous siuTonnds with the membrane lining the interior of the skull. It forms a cord loosely; Jqosc sheath (theca) along the spinal canal as far as the last lumbar lower end- Vertebra ; and then tapering gradually it ends opposite the second '"S; or third piece of the sacrum in a slender impervious cord which is continued to the back of the coccyx (fig. 135, b). The cajDacity of size of the sheath greatly exceeds the dimensions of the cord ; and it is siic.ith , larger in the neck and loins than in the dorsal region, coimec- On the outer aspect the spinal dura mater is smooth, in com- tions; parison with that in the skull, for it does not act as a periosteum to the bones. Between it and the wall of the canal are some vessels and fat; and it is connected to the posterior common ligament of the vertebrae by a few fibrous bands, offsets oit 6^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ dura mater sends offsets along the sj^inal nerves in iier\es; the intervertebral foramina; and these offsets become gradually longer below (fig. 135), where they form tubes which enclose the sacral nerves,

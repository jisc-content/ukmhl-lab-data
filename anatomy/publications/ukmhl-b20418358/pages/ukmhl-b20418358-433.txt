419 GREY SUBSTANCE OF CORD. eoniBiissivral or connecting piece between tliem. The same cut demonstrates the existence of a mass of grey matter in the interior, which is arranged in the form of two crescents (one in eacli half), iitiited by a cross piece, and surrounded by white substance. The commissure consists of two parts, viz., a transverse band of The cum- grey matter (fig. 139, /;), with a white stratum in front. missure: The grey transverse band (posterior or grey commissure) connects the grey the opposite crescents, and is placed rather nearer the front than ' the back of the cord. In its centre is the shrunken canal of the with its "spinal cord (fig. 139, i), which is best seen in the foetus. It ^^11*™^ reaches the whole length of the medulla, and a cross section of the cord shows it as a round spot. Above, the canal opens on the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and below, it is continued into the filum terminale. It is lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium, and is lined by olxstructed l)y a granular material near the upper end. epithehum, The anterior or white commissure is best marked opposite the en- the white largements on the cord, and is least developed in the dorsal region. The half of the medulla. In the half of the cord, as in the com- The half of missure, grey and white portions exist ; the former is elongated from before back, being crescentic in shape as before said, and is quite surrounded by the latter. The grey crescent (fig. 139, g) has its extremities or cornua directed The grey towards the roots of tlie nerves, and the crescent, convexity to the middle line.

It is j rather narrow at its base (cervix;'), and y' '^'f^'^ enlarged towards its extremity (caput; ^), ^ its parts where it is surmounted by a semi-trans- 'parent layer which has been named the substantia gelatinosa (^). There is also on the inner side of the cervix of the posterior cornu a special portion of grey matter containing nerve-cells, the posterior vesicular cofumn of Clarke (^), which is most developed in the lower dorsal region. The anterior cornu (fig. 140,") is shorter and thicker than the Anterior posterior, and projects towards tlie anterior roots without reaching the surface. Its end has an irregular or zigzag outline. A third smaller projection of the grey matter is seen in the u]3per inter- part of the dorsal region of the cord, on the outer side of the crescent, pvocoss. between the anterior and posterior horns : this is known as the inter- mediate process ((lowers) or the lateral cornu (fig. 140,^). * Outline of the grey substance in tlie spinal cord, near the middle of the «lorsal region (Lockhart Clarke). 1.

SEMINAL TUBES OF TESTICLE. 525 nearly to the lower end, and is rather larger and deeper above than below. It is formed of two pieces, which are united in front at an acnte angle. To its front and sides the finer septal processes are connected ; and in its interior are contained the blood-vessels behind, and a network of seminal ducts (rete testis) in front. Of the finer processes of the tunica albuginea (fig. 175, h) which and enter the testis, there are two kinds. One set, round and cord-like, ^^^"^ ^^^^^^' but of different lengths, is attached posteriorly to the mediastinum, and serves to maintain the shape of the testis. The other set forms delicate membranous septa, which divide the mass of seminal tubes into lobes, and join the mediastinum, like the rest. Within the tunica albuginea is a thin vascular layer, the tunica a vascular msculosa, which lines the fibrous coat, and covers the different septa !f^f^' ^P®^ . . . . . . (tunica in the interior of the gland. It is formed of the ramifications of vasculosa). the blood-vessels, united by areolar tissue, like the j)ia mater of the brain : in it the arteries are subdivided before they are distributed on the secerning tubes, and the small veins are collected into larger trunks. The seminal tubes (tubuli seniiniferi) are very convoluted, and Secerning are but slightly held together by fine areolar tissue and surrounding ^ ' blood-vessels, so that they may be readily drawn out of the testis and^^^*^"^^ for some distance: their length is about two feet and a quarter length; (Lauth). Within the lobes of the testis some tubes end in distinct communi- closed extremities ; but the rest communicate, forming loops or ^'^^^""^ > arches. Their diameter varies from y^th to y^^^h of an inch, and size. The wall of the tube is formed of a thin translucent membrane, but it has considerable strength. Names from the arrangement of the tubes. To different parts of the Tubes seminal tubes, the following names have been applied. Where the naniS^ tubules are collected into masses, they form the lobes of the testis. As they enter the fibrous mediastinum they become straight, and are named tubuli recti. Communicating in the mediastinum," they produce the-rete testis. And, lastly, as they leave the upper end of the gland they are convoluted, and are called vasa efi'erentia, or coni vasculosi. The lobes of the testis (fig. 175, a) are formed by bundles of the They form seminiferous tubes, and are situate in the intervals between the ^^^^^' processes of the tunica albuginea. From 100 to 200 in number "^"^^^i" 5 (Krause), they are conical in form, with the base of each at the^^^-®' circumference, and the apex at the mediastinum testis ; and those in the centre of the testicle are the largest. Each is made up of two or more tortuous seminal tubules ; and tubes in the minute tubes in one lobe are united with those in the neighbour- arrange- ing lobes. Towards the apex of each lobe the tubules become less bent, and are united together; and the tubuli of the several lobes are farther joined at the same spot into the tubuli recti. Tubuli recti (^cr, 175, c). The seminal tubes uniting together Tubes next become narrower and straighter in direction, and are named tubuli straight recti or vasa recta : they pierce the fibrous mediastinum and enter f^^^^ the rete testis.

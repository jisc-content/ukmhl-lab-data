LEVATOR ANl MUSCLE. 549 raising the floor of tlie pelvis : it may also draw the coccyx slightly forwards. The LEVATOR ANi (fig. 180, d) is a thin flat muscle, which is Levator attached above to the side of the pelvis, and descends into the outlet of the cavity, where it joins its fellow and supports the viscera, situation; It arises anteriorly by tendinous fasciculi from the back of the origin from pubis along an oblique line in front of the obturator internus ; and 1^"^^^^' below this some fleshy fibres often spring from the upper surface of Fig. 180.* the triangular ligament. Posteriorly it is attached to the lower and [• ''^"^g^^^'^ inner part of the ischial spine ; and between the osseous attach- j^^j^j^^ ' ments the muscle takes origin in the angle between the obturator spine, and recto-vesical portions of the pelvic fascia (along the curved and pelvic line * in fig. 179). From this wide origin the fibres converge, the anterior being directed backwards, and the posterior downwards and inwards, to be inserted in the following manner :—The most insertion n-i p • • • •11 1 /. 1 • centi-al anterior fibres, lew m numl3er, join with the muscle of the opposite point of side in the central point of the perineum ; the succeeding fibres, P"^""®""^' which arise from the pubis, are the longest, and pass backwards over the prostate to the side of the rectum, where they mix to a rectum, small extent with the fibres of the sphincter muscles, but most of them are continued to the tip of the coccyx ; and the posterior a median fibres meet the opposite muscle in a narrow aponeurosis behind ^P^^'^"^^''^^' the gut, and are attached in part to the side of the coccyx (p. 426). and coccyx; The anterior fibres of the levator are in contact with the trian- relations of gular perineal ligament; and there is an interval iDetween the two ^^"^'^i^''^' * Side view of the muscles in the outlet of the pelvis (Illustrations of Dis- sections).

In the anterior wall are the two pectoral muscles, but these take unequal shares in in front, its construction :â€”thus the pectoralis major (a) extends over the whole front of the space, reacliing from the clavicle to the edge of the anterior fold ; while tlie pectoralis minor (b) corresponds only and behind; to about the middle third of the wall. In the posterior boundary, from above downwards, lie the subscapularis (f), the latissimus dorsi muscle (d), and the teres major (e) : the free margin of this boundary, which is formed l)y the latissimus dorsi and teres major, is thicker and more prominent, especially near the arm, than tlie anterior. on the On the inner side of the axilla lie the first five ribs, with their inner, and intervening intercostal muscles, and the part of the serratus magnus outer sides; (^(j) taking origin from those bones.

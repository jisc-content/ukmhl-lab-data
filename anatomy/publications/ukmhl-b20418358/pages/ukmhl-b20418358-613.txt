699 INTERPUBIC DISC. Dissection. The disc will be best seen by making a transverse How to section of the bones, which will show the disposition of the anterior ligament of the articulation, and the thickness of the plate, with its toothed mode of attachment to the bone ; and when another oppor- tunity offers, a vertical section may be made. The interpubic disc consists of a layer of cartilage on each side, Interpubif; which is firmly adherent to the ridged surface of the bone, and a '^^^^^' fibrous portion in the middle. The fibrous part is thickest in front ; and at the upper and back portion of the symi3hysis there is deft in it. generally a fissure, produced by the absorption of the fibrous sub- stance. In some bodies the fissure extends through the whole of the disc, so as to divide it completely into two. The thin obturator membrane (fig. 197, h) closes almost ohturatoi entirely the thyroid foramen, and is composed of fibres crossing in "'embrane " closes ail different directions. It is attached to the bony margin of the fora- aperture men, except alcove where the obturator vessels pass through ; and at the lower and inner part of the aperture it is connected to the pelvic aspect of the hip-bone. The surfaces of the ligament give attachment to the obturator muscles. Branches of the obturator vessels perforate it.

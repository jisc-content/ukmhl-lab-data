123 MUSCLES OF PHAEYNX. The Pharynx is a portion of the alimentary canal which, gives pharynx: passage to both food and air. It is placed behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and extends from the base of the skull to the lower extent; border of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, where it ends in the oesophagus, on a level with the lower part of the sixth cervical vertebra. In form it is somewhat conical, with the dilated part form; upwards ; and its length averages about four and a half inches, but length; varies according to the position of the head and the degree of elevation of the larynx. The tube of the pharynx is incomplete in front, where it com- j^jg^'^^-^'g^^'"' municates Avith the cavities above mentioned, but is closed above, behind, and at the sides. Below, it opens into the gullet. On relations; each side of it are placed the trunks of the carotid arteries, with the internal jugular vein, and the accompanying cranial and sym- pathetic nerves. Behind it is the spinal column, covered by muscles, viz., longi colli and recti capitis antici. In front, the pharynx is united to the larynx, the hyoid bone, attach- the tongue, and the bony framework of the nasal fossoe, which form ^' the boundaries of its cavity in this direction. Behind and at the and con- sides, it has a special muscular Avail, and is only united by very loose connective tissue to surrounding parts. At the upper end the bag is completed by a fibrous aponeurosis Avhich fixes it to the base of the skull; and the whole is lined by mucous membrane. The aponeurosis of attachment is seen at the upper part of the Aponeurosis pharynx, where the muscular fibres are absent, to connect the tube ^^^'^^ to the base of the skull, and to complete the posterior boundary. Superiorly it is fixed to the basilar process of the occipital, and the petrous part of the temporal bone ; but inferiorly it becomes thin, and is lost in the layer of connective tissue between the muscular and mucous strata. On this membrane some of the fibres of the auperior constrictor muscle terminate. The Muscles of the pharyngeal wall are arranged in two layersâ€” JJ^"^layer's an outer comprising the three constrictors, the fibres of which run more or less transversely to the direction of the tube, and an inner of longitudinal fibres derived from the stylo-pharyngeus and palato- pharyngeus. Externally the constrictor muscles are covered by a ^g^g^^"*^^^ fascia, which is continued forwards above, beneath the internal pterygoid muscle, to the surface of the buccinator (bucco-pharyngeal fascia, p. 26), The INFERIOR CONSTRICTOR (fig. 30, a), the most superficial, J'yjJytJi^toi. arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage, and from the inferior arises from cornu, oblique line, and upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The ^^^^^^ origin is small when compared with the insertion, for the fibres radiate as they pass backwards, to be inserted along the middle line, line; where the muscles of opposite sides join. The outer surface of the muscle is in contact with the sheath of PJ^^^^^j.^ the carotid vessels, and with the muscles covering the spinal column, ^^ith it. The lower border is nearly horizontal, and beneath it the inferior laryngeal nerve and vessels (^) pass ; while the upper border ascends very obliquely and overlaps the middle constrictor.

DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 204 cerebrum. Crossing its anterior surface is tlie optic tract; and between tbe crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space^ which contains the posterior perforated space, the corpora albicantia, and the tuber cinereum with the infundibulum.

The peduncle consists of a superficial layer of white tiiree parts. f^\^y.Q^^ ^^j^g crusta, continued from the longitudinal fibres of the pons, a prolongation of the reticular formation termed the tegmentum, and an intermediate stratum of grey matter—the substantia nvjra. Dissection, Dissedion. For the purpose of showing the structure of the crus Fig. 64.* on the right side (fig. 60), the optic tract should be divided, and the fibres continuous with the pyramid of the medulla oblongata should be raised as far as the junction of the crus with the hemisphere. In this proceeding the substantia nigra (g) will appear ; and beneath it will be seen the tegmentum. Ci'usta. The crusta is composed of coarse bundles of white fibres, ascending * Under surface of the brain, a. Medulla oblongata, b. Hemisphere of cerebellum, c. Flocculus, d. Pons. e. Corpus albicans. /.

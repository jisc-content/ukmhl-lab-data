POSTEEIOR CERYICAL NERVES. 401 Tlie deep cervical artery is met with on tlie semispinalis muscle ; and t\w a part of tlie vertebral artery will be found in contact with the first ^ ''^^^^^ • nerve ; and the occipital artery will be visible crossing the occipital bone. ^ Opposite the thorax the dorsal nerves and vessels will be readily nerves and displayed on the inner side of the longissimus dorsi muscle, on the the'^dorsai removal of a little fatty tissue from between the transverse pro- i^egion; cesses. External and internal branches are to be traced from each nerve and vessel into the muscles : some of the former have been seen in the interval between the ilio-costalis and the longissimus dorsi. The two l^ranches of the lumbar nerves and vessels are in in the lum- the same line as the dorsal ; but the inner set are difficult to find. ^®sion. ^" The sacral nerves are placed beneath the multifidus spina), and will be dissected after the examination of that muscle (p. 408). Posterior Primary Branches of the Spinal Nerves. The Posterior spinal nerves, with a few exceptions in the cervical and sacral groups, spina/ ^ ^ divide in the intervertebral foramina into their anterior and posterior nerves, primary branches. The posterior supply the integuments and the muscles of the back, and are now to be learnt. In the neck. The posterior primary divisions of the cervical in tiie neck nerves are eight in number, and issue between the transverse pro- cesses ; but those of the first and second, which begin on the neural arches of the atlas and axis, appear above those arches. All, except they divitie the first, divide into internal and external branches. exceprtirst. The external hrcmches (fig. 132) are very small, and end in the External splenitis, and in the muscles prolonged from the erector spin^e. ^^^sniait The internal branches [fig. 133) are larger than the external; they jj^^g^-j^j^j are directed towards the spinous processes, the lower three passing branches: Ijeneath the semispinalis, and the up2)er fotir over that muscle. By the side of the spines cutaneous branches are furnished to the neck so"ie give and the head from the nerves that are superficial to the semispinalis: offsets, these cutaneous offsets ascend to the surface through the splenitis, the complextis, and the trapezius muscles, and are distributed as before seen (p. 388). In their course the nerves supply the surrounding muscles, viz., coniplexus, semispinalis, multifidus spinoe, and iiiter- s])inales. The cutaneous branches of the second and third nerves reach the head, and require a separate notice. That of the second nerve (fig. 133,^), named great occipital, '''P'^g^gj^^-jl ^-^ pears beneath the inferior oblique muscle, to which it gives offsets, head, and is directed upwards through the complextis and trapezius to end on the occiput (p. 8). The l)ranch of the third nerve (fig. 133,') becoming superficial Third near the middle line, gives an offset upwards to the lower part of neckband the occiput, internal to the preceding (p. 388). This nerve usually ^'^^d- joins the great occipital twice, viz., beneath the complexus and superficial to the trapezius. The loosterior primary division of the suboccipital or first spinal First nerve nerve (fig. 133,^) is very short, and appears in the interval between

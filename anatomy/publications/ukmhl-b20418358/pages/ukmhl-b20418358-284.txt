DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 270 infraspina- The INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE (fig, 89, b) occiipies the infraspinoiis froni"^^^ fossa of the scapula, and extends to the upper end of the humerus, fossa of that The niuscle arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula, name; from the dorsal surface of the bone helow that process, except at the neck and the narrow area along the axillary border where the teres muscles are attached, and from a special fascia covering it. Its insertion; fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the middle impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and joins the Fig. 89.* tendons of the supraspinatus and teres minor. The fleshy fibres arising from the spine overlie the tendon of the muscle. relations; A part of the muscle is subcutaneous ; but the upper portion is concealed by the deltoid, and the lower angle by the latissimus dorsi. The lower border is in contact with the teres minor, with which it is often united. The muscle lies on the scapula and the scapulo-humeral articulation ; and there is sometimes a small bursa between it and the capsule of the joint. and use. Action. With the humerus hanging it acts as a rotator outwards ; and when the bone is raised it will move the arm backwards in concert with the hinder part of the deltoid. * View of the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and of the circumflex vessels and nerve.

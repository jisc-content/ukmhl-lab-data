HOLLOW IX FRONT OF ELBOW. 291 he carefully cleaned ; and the adjoining muscles may be fixed with stitches to prevent their displacement. The anterior annular ligament of the wrist, w^hicli arches over Definp the tendons passing to the hand, is next to be defined. This strong ai^tenoi' band is at some depth from the surface ; and wddle the student ligament, removes the fibrous ti^.sue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the palm of the hand. The ulnar vessels and nerve pass over the ligament, and will serve as a guide to its depth. Hollow in front of the elbow (fig. 95). This hollow is situate Hollow in between the inner and the outer muscles of the forearm, and is eibow*^/ ^^'^ triangular in shajje, with the wider part towards the humerus. It is bounded on the outer side by the supinator longus muscle, and boundaries; on the inner side by the pronator teres. The aponeurosis of the limb is stretched over the. space ; and the bones, covered by the brachialis anticus and supinator brevis, form the deep boundary. Contents. In the hollow are lodged the termination of the brachial '^o'ltents of . , . . 1 1 T , . t^^^*^ space; artery, with its veins, and the median nerve ; the musculo-spiral nerve ; the tendon of the biceps muscle ; and small recurrent vessels, with much fat and a fe^v glands. These several parts have the following relative position :—-The and their tendon of the bicejis is directed towards the outer boundary to reach another- the radius ; and on the outer side, concealed by the supinator longus muscle, is the musculo-spiral nerve. Nearly in the centre of the space are the l^rachial vessels and the median nerve, the nerve being internal; but as the artery is inclined to the outer side of the limb, they soon become distant from one another about half an inch. The brachial artery divides here into two trunks—radial and ulnar; and the recurrent radial and ulnar ])ranclies appear in the space— the former on the outer, and the latter on the inner side. Two or three lymphatic glands lie on the sides of the artery, and lymphatic- one below its point of splitting. ° Muscles on the Front of the Forearm (fig. 95). The muscles on the front of the forearm are divided into a superficial and a deep group. In the superficial group there are five muscles, which are fixed to superficial the inner condyle of the humerus by a common tendon, and lie in fJJ'^'JJij^g the under-mentioned order from the outer to the inner side;—five muscles, pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris ; and deeper and larger than any of these is the flexor sublimis digitorum. The deep group will be met witli in a subsecpient dissection (p. 298). The pronator radii teres (fig. 95,^) arises from the inner con- Pronator dyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from the ridge above ^'^y^^J the condyle by fleshy fibres, from the fascia, and the septum between ^y^two it and the next muscle, and by a second tendinous slip from the inner ^i^-^i'^s: edge of the coronoid process of the ulna. It is inserted by a flat insertion; tendon into an impression, an inch in length, on the middle of the outer surface of the radius. u 2

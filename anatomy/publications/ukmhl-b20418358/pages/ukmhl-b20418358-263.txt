249 CUTANEOUS NEllVES OF CHEST. the middle, and the inner end. Others (anteiior cutaneous of the thorax) appear at the side of the sternum,—one from each inter- costal space. And tlie rest (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be looked for along the side of the chest, about an inch behind the interior fold of the axilla, there being one from each intercostal and inter- space except tlie first: as the last-mentioned nerves pierce the wall ^g^ves • ■of the thorax, they divide into anterior and posterior branches. The posterior branches of the highest two nerves are larger than nerve of the rest. They are to be followed across the armpit, and a junc- ^"''^^^f-'- tion is to be found there Avith a branch (nerve of Wrisberg) of the brachial plexus. Cutaneous xeiive.s from the cervical plexus. These cross J^"^*^^"^ JJJ** the clavicle and are distiibuted to the skin over the pectoral muscle, cervical The most internal branch (sternal) lies near the inner end of the Plexus, bone, and reaches but a short distance below it. Other branches (clavicular), two or more in nunilx^r and larger, cross the middle ■of the clavicle, and extend to near the lower border of the pectoralis major; they join one or more of the anterior cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneous Nerves of thk Thorax are derived from the trunks of the intercostal nerves between the ribs. Of these there intercostais; are two sets :—One set, lateral ciitaiicoiis iwrres of the thorax, arise in two rows, from those nerves about midway bet am'en 1])e spine and the sternum. The other set, anterior cutaneovs ncrrcs nf //u fJiorax, are the termi- nations of the same trunks at the. anterior ends of the intercostal .spaces. The anterior cutaneous nerves are slender filaments which One near pierce the pectoral muscle, and are directed outwards to supply the ""^^^^^ skin and the mammary gland. The ofiset of the second nerve joins a cutaneous branch from the cervical plexus. Small branches of the internal mammary vessels accompany these nerves. The lateral cutaneous nerves (fig. 83) issue with companion The other vessels between the digitations of the sei-ratus magnus muscle, and thVchlst^; <livide into anterior and posterior branches.

The cutaneous nerve of the second inter- costal trunk commonly wants the anterior offset.

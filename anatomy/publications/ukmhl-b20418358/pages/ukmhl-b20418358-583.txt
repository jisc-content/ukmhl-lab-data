SACEAL PLEXUS. gradually narrower as it leaves the pelvis below the pyriformis, ending; forms the great sciatic nerve. A part of the third nerve, however, and the branch of the fourth entering the plexus unite to form a lower smaller trunkâ€”the pudic nerve ; and other branches are given off by the several nerves before their union. Fig. 185.* Branches. Most of the offsets of the plexus are distributed out- and side the pelvis, and are met with in the dissection of the buttock ^^^^"^^ (p. 645) ; of these only the origin is to be seen now. The named branches are the great and small sciatic, the superior and inferior gluteal, the pudic, and the perforating cutaneous. Other small ofl- sets are furnished to some of the muscles of the buttock. a. The great sciatic nerve (fig. 185, gs) is the principal nerve of Great the lower limb, and is formed by the union of four large roots from ^^'^^'"^ the lumbo-sacral cord and the first three sacral nerves. * Diagram of the sacral plexus, from behind.

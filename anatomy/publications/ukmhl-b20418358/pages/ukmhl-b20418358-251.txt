INTERNAL STRUCTUEE. The fv.rroired band (fig. 80, d) is a narrow ridge of grey matter, Furrowed notched on the surface, which passes from the side of the uvula to the constricted base of the amygdaloid lobe. It lies along the attached posterior margin of the inferior medullary velum. Structure of the Cerebellum. The interior of the cerebellum Cerebeihuu c(msists ( tf a large white mass—the medullary centre, from which a'^whit? offsets pioceed to the lamina? and to other parts of the encephalon. medullary The medullary centre is surrounded, except in front, where the ^^"^'^ }>rocesses to other parts of the brain (peduncles of the cerebellum) issue from it, l)y a superficial layer of grey substance—the cortex 0/and grey the ceirbeUum ; and other small masses of grey matter are embedded in it. Structure of tlie lamina'. The laminre are seen in the section that Laminrt' has been made of the under vjart of the left hemisphere to consist ofS'^'J' , . , . , ^ externally, a grey external portion envelopmg a white centre (fig. 72). The and white grey matter is subdivided into two layers, the superficial of which is lighter and clear, while the deeper stratum is darker and of a rust-colour. The white part is derived from the medullary centre, Avhich sends off numerous j^rocesses to tlie lobes and the bodies ccmiposing the worm, and these, dividing like the branches of a tree, end in small offsets whicli enter the several laminte. Dissection. For the purpose of seeing the medullary centre, with Dissection, its contained corpus dentatum, remove all the laminae from the upper surface on the left side. This dissection may be accomplished by placing the scalpel in the horizontal fissure at the circumference, and carrying it inwards as far as the upper vermiform process, so as to detach the anterior and ])osterior lobes of the upper aspect. If the corpus dentatum does not at first appear, thin slices may be made anteriorly till it is reached. The medullary centre of tlie cerebellum forms a large oval mass in White each hemisphere, but is flattened and narrow in the middle between ^^^^^^'^ tlie vermiform, processes (hg. 69). The lateral part contains the grey corpus dentatum, and is continued in front into a large stalk- like process, which becomes divided into the three peduncles. From its surface, as already stated, offsets are furnished to the different lobes and laminae. The white centre is composed mainly of the consists of fibres of the peduncles radiating to the cortical grey matter; but radiating, there are in addition, as in the cerebrum, commissural fibres between commis- the two hemispheres, which are most developed at the fore part of the superior vermiform process, and at the back close to the median ^"[j^^^^.^^^ notch, as well as a system of association-fibres uniting the laminae fibres, beneath the sulci. The cmyus dentatHm iti situate in the inner part of the white mass Dentate of the hemisphere, and resembles the nucleus in the olivary body of si^ultion, the medulla oblongata. It measures about three-quarters of an inch from before back, and consists of a plicated capsule, which g^^'J^,,^,^^^.^ Avhen cut across appears as a thin, wavy, greyish-yellow line : the bag is open at the fore and inner part, and encloses a core of white substance. Through its aperture issues a band of fibres to join the superior peduncle.

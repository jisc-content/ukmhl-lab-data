399 ACTION OF ERECTOR SPINJ^. splenius and levator aiiguli scapulae on the outer side and the com- plexus on the inner side, the trachelo-mastoid being next to the complexus. The cervicalis ascendens is attached to the transverse processes in a line with the splenius colli, and immediately behind the middle and posterior scalene muscles, * Action of erector sinnce. These powerful muscles draw backwards Use of botii or extend tlie spine, and come into play in bringing the column ^^^^ Fig. 132.* into, and in maintaming the erect position. The parts inserted into the dorsal vertebrae will be to some extent inspiratory muscles, since tlie dilatation of the thorax is aided by extension of the verte- ]3ral column ; but the slips inserted into the ribs will draw down- wards these bones, and may thus act in forced expiration. The muscle of one side acting alone will incline the spine laterally. The cervical prolongations liave a similar action upon the neck and head. ^ Fifth Layer of Muscles.

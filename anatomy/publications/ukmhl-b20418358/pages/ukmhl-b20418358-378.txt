Dissection of Directions. The cardiac plexus has been injured by the previous the plexus: examination of the heart, so that it should be dissected in a body in which the heart and the large vessels are entire, to expose JJissection. The ascending aorta is to be cut across near the heart, partand is to be drawn over to the left side : next, the upper cava is to be divided above the entrance of the azygos vein, and its lower part is to be thrown down. By the removal of some fibrous and fatty tissues and lymphatic glands, the right part of the plexus will be seen in front of the trachea, above the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The oftsets to the heart should be followed downwards on the trunk of the pulmonary artery; and those to the lung should be traced along the right branch of that vessel. To lay bare the part of the plexus into which the nerves of the and the left, left side enter, the aorta is to be cut through a second time, between the subclavian artery and the attachment of the ligament of the

Double valves, like those of the veins, are present in the interior of the tube; and a pair guards the opening into the posterior part of the vein. Freq^uently the upper part of the duct is divided; and there may be separate openings into the large veins corresponding with those divi- sions. Large lymphatic vessels from the left side of the head and necky Fig. 29. and from the left upper limb, open into the upper part of the duct, and sometimes separately into the veins (^Â°).

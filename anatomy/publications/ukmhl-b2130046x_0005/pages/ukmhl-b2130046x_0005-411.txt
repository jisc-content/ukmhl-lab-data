1067 THORAX. 100 to 60; Mechli at 52 and 40*; Dr. Herbert, of Gottingen concludes this volume to be "very little." f We have found it to vary from 75 to 100 cubic inches. It must be relative to the absolute capacity of the chest, which varies from 248 to 457 cubic inches. The mean absolute capacity is 312 cubic inches. Allowing 100 cubic inches for the heart and large blood vessels, and 100 cubic inches for the parenchymatic structure of the lungs, will leave a little more than 100 cubic inches for the residual air; therefore Allen and Pepys's opinion may be relied upon as very near the truth. (bj Reserve volume. — Goodwyn omits this volume altogether; and this omission was pointed out forty years ago by a phy- siologist who himself omitted any notice of the complemented air. Kite estimates this at 87 cubic inches; Davy, by an experiment upon himself, at 77 cubic inches \ ; Dr. Bos- tock, from trials upon himself, at 100 or 170§; Mechel at 110 cubic inches.|| It averages about 100 cubic inches ; our obser- vations range from 70 to 110 cubic inches. It is regulated by the point at which the or- dinary breathing movement commences. (c) Breathing volume. — This has attracted most attention ; but the discrepancies of opinion are nearly commensurate with the number of observations. It would require years of labour to determine this volume by direct experiment, in a manner to be avail- able to the physician ; and it would re- quire a long time to perfect the observation of it upon a single patient, because these movements are so delicately affected by the mind, so perfectly uncontrollable, and the volume is so small, that a little error would seriously damage the value of the observation. The volume assigned by observers, vailing from 3 to 100 cubic inches, is as follows :— Cub. in.

Though our ob- servations upon this point are but scanty com- pared with those we made on the vital capa- city, yet from about 80 experiments we con- clude that man in a perfectly quiet state, as when sitting, reading, &c, breathes much less than he does under the ordinary excitement of moving about. We think the perfectly quiet breathing, when we can scarcely perceive any movement (which is by no means uncommon), may be from 7 to 12 cubic inches, and when under ordinary excitement and exercise, from 16 to 20 cubic inches ; we have known it in one case as high as 77 cubic inches. It is probable that the quantity is relative to the volume of blood to be aerated. Herbert found that adults of smaller stature breathed less than those who were taller.* It is proba- ble that phthisical patients breathe very little, — from 2 to 4 cubic inches ; but the number of their breathing movements is greater, which compensates for this small quantity. (r/) Convplemental volume. — Davy, from a single experiment (upon himself}, calcu- lates this at 119 cubic inches f ; Kite, at nearly 200 cubic inches.J It is regulated by the position of the ordinary breathing movement, which is intermediate between it and the reserve air. It averages, from direct experiment, rather higher than the reserve volume, — about 105 or 110 cubic inches. Taking the mean height at 5 ft. 8 in. the vital capacity is 230 cubic inches, that is to say — cub. in. Reserve air - - - 100 Ordinary breathing - 20 Complemental - - 110 230 (<■) Vital capacity volume. — Jurin and Hales correspond in stating this at 220 cubic inches $ ; Davy at 213 cubic inches || ; and he remarks in a note, " this capacity is pro- bably below the medium. My chest is nar- row, measuring in circumference but 29 inches, and my neck rather long and slender." It is probable the figures 29 are a misprint for 2 feet 9 inches round the chest. Dr. Thomson, from the mean of twelve experi- ments, upon men from fourteen to thirty- three years of age, states it at 186£ cubic inches. Dr. Thomson himself could expel 193 cubic inches. He mentions that this volume is constant when once determined. * Midler, El. Phys., 1st ed. 8vo., Lond. p. 294» vol. i., 1847. t Op. Git. p. 410. % Op.

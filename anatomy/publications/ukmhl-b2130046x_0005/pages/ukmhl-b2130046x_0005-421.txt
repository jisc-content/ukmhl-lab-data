1077 THORAX. the lb. will correspond to the inch, for that is accidental, merely depending upon the units employed, but that the increase of each will be found in an arithmetical progression, and hence, probably, the reason why tall men breathe more than short men. But the weight can never be the sure guide that the height is, because the former varies at any time in life, even in a few days; where- as the latter varies only at the extremes of life. 4th. Relation of vital capacity to the circum- ference of the thorax.— We notice this here, because the question is so natural, " Has the size of the chest no relation to the vital capacity ? " We do not find that there exists any direct relation between the cir- cumference of the chest and the vital capa- city. We have found — Height. Circum. Vital Men. ft. in. in. capacity. 11 5 8 35 235 10 5 8 38 226 Therefore, the men with chests 3 inches larger, breathed 9 cubic inches less, or 21 men of the same height, but of different-sized chests, breathed a mean vital capacity of 230 (the due quantity according to Table T). We have consolidated the following result upon 994 cases, the height is kept in view, calcu- lated at 5 feet 61 inches.

There is a certain rude relation between the thoracic dimensions and the vital capacity ; if, for in- stance, one man has a chest 35 inches in cir- cumference, and 3 inches mobility, and another man has a chest 40 inches in circumference, and 4 inches mobility, then the latter will surely displace a larger volume of air than the former, but omitting this, we expect as large a vital capacity from a man with a thin and narrow thorax, as from a man with a broad and deep thorax. In fact, aeration need have no re- lation to the thoracic dimension ; and, for the same reason, the size of the chest no relation to the vigour of the whole man. Indeed we incline to the contrary, viz. that it is most likely the respiration is most vigorous in the narrow-chested man, when the mobility is greatest. The vigour of the lungs, like every other organ in the body, we believe, has no relation to the dimensions. One person may have a brain 1 lb. lighter, or less than an- other person, and yet their capacity and men- tal qualities shall not appear different. 5th. Vital capacity affected by age. — Age affects the breathing movements, but less re- markably than tire height and weight. Indeed the influence of age was not apparent in the first calculation upon 1012 cases, nor until we took a basis of 1923 cases. Time affects life in two ways, first bringing it to perfection, and then determining that perfection. Table C C. — Effect of Age, from Observations on 1775 healthy Men. the Height being kept in View.

From 15 to 35 years of age the vital ca- pacity is increased, and from 35 to 65 years of age it is decreased in the progression of 19, 11, and 13 cubic inches. We illustrate this by a curve in fig. 709. The curve of the vital capacity will be seen to rise slightly as it passes the perpendicular lines of years until it comes to 35 years of age, after which it keeps declining as it cuts all the succeeding lines of quinquennial periods down to 65 years. We may say, therefore, that the vital capacity increases with the age up to 3 z 3

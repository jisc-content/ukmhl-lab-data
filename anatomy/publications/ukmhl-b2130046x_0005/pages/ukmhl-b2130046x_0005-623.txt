1279 URINE. the variation of the sulphates in urine, and has arrived at the following conclusions : — 1. The sulphates are increased by food, both animal and vegetable. 2. Exercise does not produce so marked an increase in the sulphates. 3. Sulphuric acid in large doses increases the proportion of sulphates ; in small doses it produces little or no effect. 4. Sulphur, when taken, increases the sul- phates in the urine, and sulphate of soda or magnesia produces the greatest effect on the quantity of sulphates in the urine. With respect to the phosphates contained in the urine, Dr. Jones has arrived at the conclusion, that the quantity of earthy phos- phates depends on the quantity contained in the ingesta, and that this is also the case with the alkaline phosphates. These latter, how- ever, are to a certain extent increased by exercise. » URINE OF ANIMALS. The urine of animals varies much in cha- racter, according to the kind of food taken. Thus, there are striking differences between the urine of the carnivora and the herbivora. The urine of carnivorous animals is ge- nerally acid when discharged, but becomes alkaline and ammoniacal very rapidly. The urine of herbivorous animals, on the con- trary, is alkaline when passed, and contains a large proportion of alkaline and earthy car- bonates. Simon, however, states the urine of horses immediately alter it is passed, to be occasionally acid. The urine of the carnivora, according to the observations of Vanquelin and Hunefeld, contains neither the uric nor hippuric acids. Hieronymi, however, who examined the urine of the lion, the tiger, and the leopard, detected uric acid in small pro- portions. The urine of the herbivora con- tains hippuric acid in large quantities, in the form of hippurate of soda. No uric acid is present according to the analyses of most chemists, but traces of it have occasionally been found in the urine of the graminivora. Hieronymi obtained the following result by the analysis of the mixed urines of the lion, tiger, and leopard. This may, therefore, be regarded as the type of the urine of the car- nivora : — Water 846-00 Urea, alcoholic extractive and free lactic acid ... - 132-20 Uric acid .... 0-22 Vesical mucus - - - - 5'10 Sulphate of potassa - - - 1/22 Chloride of ammonium, and traces of chloride of sodium - - 1*16 Earthy phosphates - 1"76 Phosphates of soda and potassa 8-02 Phosphate of ammonia - - T02 Lactate of potassa - - - 3-30 The specific gravity of the urine of these large carnivorous animals varies, according to Hieronymi, from 1059 to 1076. It is clear when passed, and of a bright yellow colour. The urine of the herbivora is turbid when passed, and generally possesses a lower spe- cific gravity than that of carnivorous animals. Thus, the urine of horses, according to Simon, is about 1045. That of oxen, according to Von Bibra, varies from 1040 to 1032. The following are two analyses of the urine of horses by Von Bibra : — Water 885-09 91284 Urea - - - - 12-44 8-36 Hippuric acid 12-60 1 23 Watery extractive 21-32 19-25 Alcoholic extractive 25-50 18-26 Mucus - 0-05 0-06 Salts soluble in water - 23-401 I 40-00 Salts insoluble in water 18-80 1 With respect to the hippuric acid present, Von Bibra found that it varied extremely in proportion in different specimens of urine. He never found that it became replaced by the benzoic acid when horses were exposed to excessive labour, an opinion which has been very generally received by chemists. He never, indeed, could detect benzoic acid under any circumstances, except in such small quantities as to require the assistance of the microscope to show its presence. The deposit which causes the turbidity observed in the urine of the horse, is com- posed as follows, according to Von Bibra : — Carbonate of lime ... 80-9 Carbonate of magnesia - 12-1 Organic matter - - - 7 0 The horses that supplied the above de- scribed specimens of urine, were fed on hay and oats, and used in agriculture. Boussingault examined the urine of a horse fed on trefoil and vetches, and states its composition as follows : — Water 910-76 Urea - 31-00 Hippurate of potassa 4-74 Lactate of potassa - 11-28 Lactate of soda - 8-81 Bicarbonate of potassa 15-50 Carbonate of lime - 10-82 Carbonate of magnesia 4-16 Sulphate of potassa - 1-18 Chloride of sodium - 0-74 Silica - - - 1-01 Phosphates, — none present. Chemists have described a red oil as ex- isting in the urine of herbivorous animals, and have attributed the peculiar odour of the secretion to the presence of that substance. Boussingault carefully examined the urine of horses with a view to obtain this oil for examination, but failed to extract it, though he operated on twenty-six gallons. He dis- tilled the whole quantity, but no trace of oil came over into the receiver. All that he ob- tained was a colourless fluid, strongly im- pregnated with the odour of horse's urine. He considers this odour dependent upon the presence of a volatile acid, and believes that the volatile red oil obtained by chemists results from the decomposition of the alkaline

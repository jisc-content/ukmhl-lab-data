THORAX. 1075 *3 z 2 from this as a starting point the weight at any height may (so far as our limited ob- servations warrant) be readily calculated. For instance, the weight is, at the height of 5 feet 155*2 8 inches, —— = 2-282 lbs. for every inch of Do stature, or 27-38 lbs. for every foot of stature. The bulk or weight of bodies having the same relative proportions, is as the third power (cubes) of either of their diameters: thus, if a person G7 inches high weighs 148-44 lbs., a person 69 inches high Taking the height from 67 to 71 inches, we have as follows : — Table Z.—The calculated Weight compared with the observed Weight, according to the above Form. should wei gh(- b \67 69\3 X 148-44=; 328509 X 148-44= 69 X 69 X 69 67 X 67 X 67 X 148-44=162-141bs.

The weights vary as the 2-75th power of the height, and not as the 3rd power. The rela- tion between the two is quite close enough to show, that there is a very intimate connec- tion between the height and the weight. The observation is made upon 1276 men at the middle period of life. We have found that the vital capacity in- creases 42 cubic inches with the weight from 100lbs. to 155lbs., and from 155 lbs. to 200 lbs. the effect is balanced by minus 5 and plus 5 cubic inches. In the first division there is an increase of 42 cubic inches ; the weight then comes into power, and disturbs the regular progression for the next division ; therefore we may say there is in the second division a de- crease of 42 cubic inches in the vital capacity volume from the effect of weight. We repre- Fig. 708. ino no 110 120 120 130 130 140 140 150 150 160 160 170 170 180 180 ISO 190 200 Vital capacity. Circumference of the chests.

The curve of volume ascends, and attains its highest at 160 lbs., and from thence it is nearly horizontal to 200 lbs. According to this, the vital capacity increases nearly in the ratio of 1 cubic inch per lb. from 105 to 155lbs., and from 155 to 200 lbs. there is no increase. This illustration of the effect of weight is cal- culated at one height, viz. 5 feet 6 inches ; therefore to this height only these points of weight (from Hi to 14 stone) refer. We have noticed that the weight increases in a certain ratio with the height, and that the weight at 5 feet 6 inches affects the vital capacity in the relation just mentioned, com- mencing when the weight exceeds 7 per cent upon the average weight. We may, perhaps, connect this same relation with the other heights through the arithmetical progression of inch by inch. For example : — the weight of men of 5 feet 1 inch is 199-9 lbs. ; to this add 7 per cent (8 395 lbs.), making 128-2 lbs.; again, the tallest men, 5 feet 11 inches, weigh 174-2 lbs. ; to this add 7 per cent (12-2 lbs.), making 186-4 lbs.: therefore, at the height of 5 feet 1 inch a man must exceed 128 lbs., or 9 stone 2 lbs., and the 5 feet 11 inches' man 186 lbs., or 13 stone 4 lbs., before weight may be expected to diminish the vital capa- city volume in the relation of 1 cubic inch per lb. for the next 25 lbs., 2\ stone being the limit of our calculation. W hen the man exceeds the mean weight (at each height) by 7 per cent, the vital capacity decreases 1 cubic inch per lb. for the next 35 lbs. above this weight. Beyond this it is not improbable but that the decrease of the vital capacity is in some geometrical progression. Below the mean weight we have never found by experiment, that the vital capacity is affected by weight. The cause of the difference of weight between men is involved in much obscu- rity.* We may in fact consider the usual weight of a man as his mean weight and * See Chambers, Gulstonian Lect. 1850.

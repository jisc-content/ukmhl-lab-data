1284 URINE. Fig. 798. Besides these more or less crystalline de- posits, the urine in disease frequently contains blood, mucus and pus corpuscles, and also epithelial scales, and other bodies of various kinds; with all of which it is necessary the physician should be familiar, as symptomatic of different diseases. In order satisfactorily to detect these, the microscope is of course indispensable. The following are the appearances shown by these more or less organised bodies, when existing in the urineg (Jig, 799). Fig. 799. fir a, Blood corpuscles endosmosed or distended, owing to the entrance of the urine through their membrane. This effect is the consequence of the contained fluid of the corpuscles having been heavier than the urine in which they float, in virtue of which condition more fluid passed into the corpuscle than could escape out. b, Mucous corpuscles, c, Pus cor- puscles, d, Scales of epithelium, e, Fibrinous casts of the urinary tubules of the kidney, seen in the morbus Brightii, deposited from albuminous urine â€” sphe- roidal epithelium from the tubides is seen embedded in these fibrinous casts, f, Spermatozoa. </, Torula diabetica, seen in diabetic urine during its fermenta- tion. A tendency to the secretion in excessive quantity of the unorganised deposits, such as lithic acid and the lithates, oxalate of lime, &c , leads not unfrequently to the formation of urinary calculi. These are either made up, as is most frequently the case, of several of the constituents of the urine, or may be en- tirely constituted of one of them. The following table, constructed by the late Dr. Prout, exhibits a general view of the relative frequency of the different kinds of urinary calculi in England, Swabia, Germany, andDenmark. The hospitals of St. Bartho- lomew and of Guy in London, and those of Norwich, Manchester, and Bristol, principally supplied the specimens quoted in this table. The ingredients of particular species of cal- culi included between parentheses, are to be considered as existing in a mixed state. * For further information respecting urinary deposits, I must refer to Dr. Golding Bird's work on the subject, and my Treatise " on Analysis, and the Treatment of Urinary Diseases."

Thus, if a man may lose weight below his usual weight, he should gain above his usual weight before he can be said to have gained weight. The effect of weight in diminishing the re- spiratory volume, need not in the least disturb the observer, when testing the lungs through the measurement of the vital capacity, with re- ference to phthisis or any other chest disease. For collateral observations and the history of the case, will sufficiently protect him'from such difficulty. We see that the weight increases at so much per inch ; we have no doubt that by extended observations it will be found to be regular through the whole series of heights, and that it will be found to increase 7 lbs. for every inch of stature. We know that the respiratory power increases in a similar arithmetical relation. We do not mean that

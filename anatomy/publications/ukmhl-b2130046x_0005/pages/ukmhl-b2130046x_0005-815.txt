VITAL STATISTICS. 14(19 was presbyopic for horizontal lines and myopic for vertical. This lie remedied by wearing spectacles the glasses of which were cvhndric bi-convexes, with rectilinear, hori- zontal and similar axes. These glasses obvi- ated the presbyopia relative to the horizontal lines, and they were combined with sphero- bieoncave lenses to get rid of the myopia for vertical lines. Each of the glasses was made moveable for facility of cleaning. The following means are recommended to ascertain if an eye has the defect now de- scribed. The person should attentively con- template for some time and with attention a cross, three or four lines in size, made of fine wire and fixed in a frame. If affected, he will see the horizontal lines differ in thickness and blackness of tint from the vertical. To determine the focal length which the lenses should have, a person whose sight is presbyopic in one direction should take bi- sphero-convex lenses which enable him to see distinctly at the ordinary distance the lines which otherwise appear indistinct: he can deduce the focal distance of the cylindrico- convex glasses. A person myopic in one direction should do the same with regard to bi-sphero-concave lenses. The convex glasses should be chosen of one or two numbers stronger.

VITAL STATISTICS.—The duration of human life, with a consideration of the princi- pal causes by which it may be lengthened or curtailed, is a subject which evidently belongs both to the domain of physiology and to that of statistics. It belongs to physiology, in- asmuch as the duration of human life" is the final effect of the operation of natural causes brought to bear on the healthy human frame ; and it belongs to statistics, whether we use that term in the less exact sense of a branch of human knowledge largely indebted to the use of numbers, or in the more accurate sense of a department of science, having an im- portant bearing on the interests of the public.* In this place it is proposed to take only a limited view of the subject of Vital Sta- tistics, and to examine the scientific methods which have been suggested and employed for determining the true duration of human life in communities and classes of men ; in other * For some remarks on the true meaning of the term "Statistics," see Statistics, Medioai,, note, p. 803.

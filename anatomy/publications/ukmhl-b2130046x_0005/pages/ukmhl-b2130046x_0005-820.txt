1474 VITAL STATISTICS. tality would be almost nothing, while the dif- ference in the age would amount to about 20 years. So also if we compare individual years instead of terms of years. The mor- tality at 10 years is -791 per cent., at 20 years •784 per cent.; at 11 years it is -702 per cent., at 18 years .709 per cent. The rate of mor- tality differs very slightly in the ages brought umler comparison, while the mean age at death differs by 10 and 7 years respectively. These a priori reasonings are fully borne out by the results of actual comparison. In one of the reports of the Registrar General* the expectation of life (which will be presently shown to be the true test or measure of the sanitary state of a population), the mortality, and the mean age at death, for six different populations, are compared with each other, with what result the following table will show. Expectation of life, in years : — Surrey, 45 ; England, 41; France, 40; Sweden, 39; Metro- polis, 37 ; Liverpool, 26. Rate of mortality, or one death in— Surrey, 52; England, 41; France, 42; Sweden, 41; Metropolis, 39; Liverpool, 30. Mean age at death, in years: — Surrey, 34; Fiance, 34; Sweden, 31; England, 29;" Me- tropolis, 29; Liverpool, 21, The rate of mortality, then, keeps pace with the expectation of life, to such an extent, at least, as to place the six communities in the same relative position ; while, according to the mean age at death, the nations which stand third, fourth, and fifth on the list suffer transposition, France and Sweden taking rank before England in the scale of salubrity, and England, which holds, of right, the second place immediately after her own county of Surrey, is made to descend to the fourth rank. When compared, therefore, with an accurate measure of the duration of human life, the rate of mortality shows itself more worthy of confidence than the mean age at death. Nevertheless, for reasons already assigned, it must not be looked upon as altogether free from objection, and must, in every case, be regarded as of inferior value to the test next to be considered, namely,— 3. The expectation of life. — The expectation of life, or the mean future life-time, is the mean number of years which, at any given age, the members of a community, taken one with another, may expect to live. This ex- pectation is embodied in those series of cal- culations which are technically known as life- tables, and which are so largely in use in the important operations of life-assurance. When correctly calculated, they are based on the two concurrent series of facts, the numbers and ages of the living and the numbers and ages of the dying, and they therefore comprise the two elements necessary to perfect ac- curacy. When based upon the ages of the dying alone, they are open to nearly the same objection as those which apply to the mean age at death. The following is an abbreviation of the English life-table, which will be found given * Sixth Annual Report, p. 572. at length for any year of life from birth to 95 years of age in "the fifth annual report of the Registrar General.* Age. Males. Females. o- 40-19 42-18 1- 46-71 47-55 2- 48-82 49-57 3- 49-52 50-29 4- 49-74 50-48 5- 49-64 50-38 10- 47-08 47-81 15- 43-35 44-13 20- 39-88 40-81 25- 36-47 37-52 30- 33-13 34-25 40- 26-56 27-72 50- 20-02 21-07 60- 13-59 14-40 70- 8-51 9-03 80« 4-92 5-20 90- 2-68 2-77 95- 2-22 2-06 The table is read thus : — At birth the ex- pectation of a male child is 40-19 years, of a female child 42-18 years; at 5 years of age the expectation is 49 64 years for a boy and 50-38 years for a girl ; at 20 years of age, males one with another may expect to live 39-88 years, and females 40*81 years ; at 30 the expectation has fallen to 33-13 for men and 34-25 for women. 4. The mean duration of life, the mean life, the mean life-time, or vie moycnne, is found by adding the age to the expectation of life. Thus the mean duration of life at 5 years of age is 5 + 49-64 for boys, and 5+50-38 for girk, or 54-64 for boys and 55-38 for girls ; at 10 years of age the mean duration of life is, for boys and girls respectively, 10+47*08 and 10 + 47-81, or 57-08 and 57 81; and at 30 years of age 30 + 33-13 or 63-13, and 30 + 34-25 or 64-25. The mean duration of life differs from the mean age at death, inasmuch as the one is a calculation based on all the deaths taking place, after a given age, in the members of a community traced through life, while the other is founded upon such deaths as happen to be noted in a community which has been undergoing continual disturbance by births, immigration, and emigration. 5. The probable duration of life, probable life-lime, equation of life, or vie probable, is the age at which a number of children born into the world will be reduced one-half, so that the chance is equal of their dying before or after that age. Thus it has been ascertained that out of 51,274 males and 48,726 females (making up together the number of 100,000 infants) at birth, 25,637 males will die between the 45th and 46th year, or at about 45£ years of age, and 24,363 females between the 47th and 48th year, or at about 47'i years ; so that the equation of life or probable life-time of males at birth is 45^ years, and of females * Report, p. xix.

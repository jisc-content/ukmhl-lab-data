The molars of the Dugong are examples of teeth com- posed of dentine and cement, the latter tissue forming a thick external layer. Fig. 546.

In the great teeth of the lower jaw of the Cachalot, the pulp-cavity of the growing tooth becomes filled up by osteo-dentine, the result of a modified calci- fication of the dentinal pulp ; and the full- grown tooth presents three tissues, as shown

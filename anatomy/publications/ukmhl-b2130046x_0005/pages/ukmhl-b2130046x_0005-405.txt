We subjoin the following table of the result of these cases. (Table S.) To illustrate one of the points so striking in these experiments (viz., the difference be- tween the inspiratory and expiratory power), we refer to diagram 701., which represents by curves their relative position. The upper line is the expiratory power, and the double line below, the inspiratory power. The per- pendicular lines are the different heights of the cases examined. The position of these curved lines indicates the power they re- present, — the higher the curve the greater the power. The two rows of figures at the bottom are the inches and tenths of inches of mercury elevated. (I. for inspiration, and E. for expiration.) According to this, at the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and 5 feet 8 inches, the inspiratory power is greatest, and thence the inspiratory power gradually decreases as the stature increases. The men of 5 feet 7 inches and 8 inches elevate a column of 3 inches of mercury: this may be considered a healthy power ; and the men of G feet high elevate about 2\ inches of mercury as their healthy power.

It may be asked, why connect this with the height ? Because it was found in six collateral observations that this was the only physical condition which presented a relation so as to throw the experiments into an or- derly position.* By Table S we see that the respiratory power varies in different classes. The "gentlemen," for instance, are below most of the other classes : at the height of 5 feet 8 inches, they elevate by inspiration 2'35 inches of mercury. This may account for the fact why Dr. Hales could only raise 2 inches of mercury by this effort. The expiratory power is normally more irregular — more apt to vary — than the inspi- ratory power. The expiratory muscles par- ticipate in other duties besides that of mere expiration ; the vocation of the glass-blower, the trumpeter, the wrestler, the jeweller (blow-pipe), and the sailor, especially call these muscles into use, increasing their na- tural power. They thus oftentimes become excessively strong. The inspiratory muscles are exclusively for supplying us with air, in which act they have only to oppose the uniform resistance of elasticity. The inspira- tory power is therefore the best indication of the "health'"— the " vis vitce." As an instance of the effect of vocation chang- * For the other observations, see p. 10G8, and Med. Chir.

The inspiratory power of these two classes is nearly equal, whilst the expiratory power of the Thames police exceeds that of the Metropolitan police,—the former using their upper extre- mities, whilst the latter use their lower ex- tremities most: — the former chase the thief by the use of the oar ; the latter by the swiftness of their legs. Compositors and pressmen stand low the former are the lowest in their respiratory power ; the pressmen are much higher. The order in which some of these classes come is as follows : — the most powerful are the Thames police ; next, the sailors ; the pau- pers and the gentlemen are nearly equal ; and lastly, diseased cases. The two last lines is the mean of the four healthiest classes, — the seamen, firemen, Thames police, and pugilists: their maximum is 3 inches; the mean of the whole classes together is little more than 2£ inches. The measure of this power when expressed by inches of mercury appears small, yet, when hydrostatically con- sidered, it is very great. Men have wondered that they could not elevate more mercury in the tube; but all surprise vanishes when it is recollected, that, by the law of hydrostatics, when a column of 3 inches height of mer-

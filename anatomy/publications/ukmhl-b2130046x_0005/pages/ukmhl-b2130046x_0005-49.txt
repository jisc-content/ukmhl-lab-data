The temporal ridges, prolonged backwards from the post orbital apophyses, ex- tend as far as the middle of the parietal bones, and there form a short sagittal crest upon the mesial line of the skull, whence, proceeding backwards, they diverge and extend as far as the occipital ridge, which is truncated above (as is the case in the pachj'dermata generally), and projects over the posterior surface of the occiput. The intermaxillaries are prolonged considerably beyond the nasal bones, which last, by their points, arch over the cavity of the nostrils to a considerable extent. The temporal arch is comparatively very short, nearly straight, and is situated entirely in the posterior third of the skull. As regards the individual bones of the skull, it may be observed that the two frontals (Jig. 49G. a, a,f, g) remain distinct from each other after the parietals become consolidated into one piece; they are of remarkable breadth between the orbits, and posteriorly penetrate to a considerable depth between the parietal bones. The ossa parielalia (Jig. 49j. //, i) give oft" on each side of the cranium a pointed

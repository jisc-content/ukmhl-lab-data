In the absence of tables specially adapted to this purpose, it must found in the work of Gavarret, so often quoted, from p. 113. onwards, and in the notes at p. 28G. et seq. * The formula employed in the construction of this table is o-so ±yi where ", as before, represents the total of the ob- served facts. The table will be found at greater length at p. 230 of Gavarret's work on Medical Statistics. suffice to state, in general terms, that the averages derived from a given number of facts are not to be regarded as strict expressions of the truth, but as approximations more or less remote, as the number of facts is less or more considerable. But a very important question here arises : — To what extent, and under what restric- tions, do calculations based on mathematical formula; and derived from abstract reasoning, admit of application to the results of actual observation ? Conceding, as we may safely do, the soundness of the formulae, there is yet great room to doubt the propriety of their application to the average results of observa- tion. For if we suppose a mathematical formula to be applied successively to a long series of averages derived from the same number of facts, it must obviously administer a similar correction to those averages which happen to coincide with the true average, and to those which lie at the two extremes. This consideration is sufficient in itself to condemn the use of mathematical formulas, except as a means of exhibiting in a striking light the possible error attaching to a small number of facts, considered abstractedly as facts. From the foregoing considerations, then, it would seem to follow, that although averages derived from small numbers of facts are sub- ject to a considerable amount of possible error, there is always such a probability of then- coinciding with, or not differing widely from, the true averages, as to justify their employ- ment as standards of comparison and data lor reasoning. At the same time it must be con- ceded, that averages derived from small num- bers of facts stand in need of a confirmation which averages drawn from larger numbers of facts do not require, and that in using the former we are bound to speak with a reserve proportioned to the scantiness of our ma- terials. Of extreme values derived from observation. — As averages founded upon large numbers of facts are numerical expressions of true pro- babilities, so extreme values are expressions, in the same precise language, of possibilities. Both orders of facts have their scientific and practical applications ; but those applications which belong to the extreme values have been less attended to than those which pertain to averages. One obvious use of extreme values is to confirm and strengthen the conclusions drawn from averages. Thus, if we wish to ascertain the relative duration of life of two classes of persons, we may make use of the greatest age attained by either class in confirmation of the mean of all the observations ; and the coincidence of the one with the other will tiive increased confide nee in the general result. Another important use of extreme values is as a test of numerical theories. Two apt il- lustrations of this application of figures are afforded by that practical science which deals most laively in possibilities — Forensic Medi- cine. M. Orfila, in his " Traite des Exhuma- tions," states that it is possible to determine

TONGUE. ■1162 morbid anatomy of the tongue with some re- marks on faulty positions which the organ oc- casionally obtains. I have already spoken of prolapsus of the tongue, and there now re- main for consideration — tongue-tie, tongue- swallowing, and adhesion of the tongue to ad- jacent parts. Tongue-tie. — This is a congenital malform- ation, consisting in the fraenum extending too far forwards and being short, thus tying down the tongue behind the incisor teeth of the lower jaw. This may occur to any degree, from an amount that is scarcely observable, to the complete tying down the tip of the tongue behind the necks of the middle incisors of the lower jaw. The fraenum generally con- sists simply of a small amount of fibrous tissue contained in the fold of mucous membrane; but it sometimes contains fibres of the genio- glossus, which occasionally extend a con- siderable way forwards: in the former case the fraenum is thin, in the latter it may be of some thickness. When left to nature the tie gradually lengthens, and, at the same time, recedes, and any unusual thickness arising from the presence of muscular fibres gra- dually lessens. This condition, to a slight extent, is very frequent, and appears to be hereditary. The cases are, however, extremely rare where the fraenum is so short as to inter- fere with sucking, mastication, deglutition, or articulation. Tongue-swallowing. — This arises from the opposite of the last condition: the move- ments of the tongue are too free; it can be inverted, and its apex thrown back into the pharynx, which embraces it, and thus closes the aperture leading to the lungs, and symp- toms of suffocation are the result. It most frequently happens to infants. It is enume- rated by writers on Medical Jurisprudence, as one of the modes of suicide among negroes. Dr. Gordon Smith, Majendie, and Beck refer to cases of it. Mr. Crosse tells of an instance, where it could be performed at pleasure with- out the slightest inconvenience. Adhesions of the tongue. — Bernard relates an instance, in which adhesions, of the thick- ness of two lines and a half, had agglutinated the lateral parts of the tongue to the internal surface of the cheeks, to the extent of more than an inch on each side. These adhesions had succeeded an inflammation in the inside of the mouth and tongue, the circumference of which had ulcerated; they interrupted the functions of speech and mastication. M. Ber- nard divided them by a single clip of the scissors. Necrosis of the hijoid bone. — The only in- stance of disease of the hyoid bone with which I am acquainted, is one related by Mr. Spry. The disease was necrosis, the result of ex- tended ulceration, which commenced in the throat, and continued till the bone was laid bare and dead. It was then expectorated en- tire. The patient died several weeks after- wards. The bone was entirely deprived of periosteum, irregular on its surface, and in a perfect state of necrosis. [Since this Article has been in the press I have become acquainted with a discovery of Prof. Kolliker's, that the muscular fibres in certain situations are bifurcated and branched. In a letter to Prof. Bowman he says, that this is brilliantly exhibited by the muscles of the tongue, and he gives a pen and ink illustration of the method of branching. There can be no doubt about a fact so detailed by such an au- thority, but I must confess that I have not recognised the appearances described.] Bibliography. — Albinus, De Periglottide et Corpore reticulari Linguaa ; in Armot.

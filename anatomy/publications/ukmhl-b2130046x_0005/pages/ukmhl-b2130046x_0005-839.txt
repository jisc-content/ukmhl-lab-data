Arytenoids locked to each other at the apex of their superior prominence by a cartilage. || Vocal cords directed obliquely downwards to form, with the axis of the vocal tube, an angle of 30°, and are inserted at i the height of the thyroid from its lower margin.

Biog. || This cart, is peculiar to the pig. f The 1 aryivx of this animal has been described by Casserius, Herrissant, Cuvier, Wolff, and Gurlt; the former first noticed the sacs in these words, ' Fora- mina duorum ventrium per qua> aer ingreditur, ad grunnitum in porcis efficiendum." Herrissant sup- posed the sacs to be the principal organs in the production of the voice of the pig, but we cannot concur in this opinion, they merely affect the quality of the sound.

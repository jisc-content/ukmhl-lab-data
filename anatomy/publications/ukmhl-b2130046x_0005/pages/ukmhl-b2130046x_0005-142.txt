603 STATISTICS. training which is essential to the appreciation of mathematical rules, it is desirable to show, by an appeal to the results of actual observ- ation, the increasing value of increasing col- lections of facts, as well as the rate of that increase. For this purpose, it is proposed to make use of some observations collected by the writer of this article. Having had occa- sion, a few years since, to bring together, from the pages of the Peerage and Baronetage, the ages at death of the male members of the En- glish aristocracy, dying 21 years and upwards, to the number of several hundreds, it ap- peared to be a favourable opportunity of test- ing the relative values of large and small numbers of facts, as well as of obtaining a rude approximation to a rule or measure of value. The ages at death, relating, as they do, to members of the same class in society, and taken without selection from the successive obituaries of noble families, constitute a col- lection of strictly comparable facts, well suited to the purpose in view. The following table, which embodies the results of these facts in their bearing on the question before us, has been formed in the following manner : — The several facts were first arranged in groups of 25 each; two successive groups of 25 were then formed into groups of 50 ; the groups of 50, in like manner, into groups of 100, and so on, till the last totals in the table were ob- tained. The greatest and least averages ob- tained from each group of facts were then selected, and, with the range, or difference be- tween them, thrown into a tabular form. Average Age at Death. Number of Facts. Blax. Min. Range. 25 69-40 50-64 18-76 50 66-44 55-20 11-24 100 63-70 56-85 6-85 200 62-38 57-61 4-77 400 61-10 58-24 2-86 800 60-84 59-67 1-17 J 1600 60-25 Now, if we assume the true average duration of life among the members of the Peerage and Baronetage, who have attained their 21st year to extend to 60 years (being the mean of 1600 observations), and, for the sake of simplicity, substitute for the decimals in the table the whole numbers nearest to them in magnitude, it will follow that, in making use of the several groups of observations specified Number of Error in Excess Facts. or Defect. 25 9v 50 «* 100 34 200 n 400 U 800 0* in the first column of the annexed table, we may have the errors in excess or in defect which are enumerated in the second column. These figures, then, represent the extreme error which could have been committed, in this particular case, by relying on 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 facts respectively. But it must be borne in mind, that this collection of facts is one which, from the very nature of the case, is likely to present a minimum of divergence between the averages deduced from the same number of facts ; for the several obituaries, from which the ages at death are taken, register the deaths of one and the same class, inhabitants of the same country, and split into family groups bearing a close re- semblance to each other. If, instead of a single class, exposed to similar influences, and not admitting of subdivision into smaller classes, we were to take the members of that large section of the community which is ge- nerally known as the upper and middle class, with their numerous subdivisions of employ- ment, and class them by fifties and hundreds, we should encounter a much more consider- able divergence. The results of such a com- parison for the class in question are embodied in the following table. Average Age at Death. Number of Facts. Max. Min. Kange. 50 84-44 56-78 27-66 100 76-24 58-25 17-99 200 73-54 61-50 12-04 400 69-78 63-51 6-27 800 68-67 65-07 3-60 1600 67-93 64-84 3-09 3200 66-38 65-82 0-56 6400 66-10 If, as in the former case, we take 66 years to be the true average age attained by the entire middle class, reckoning from 21 years of age, and reduce the range in each case to the nearest whole number, we shall have the following divergences. Number of Error in Excess Facts. or Defect. 50 14 100 9 200 6 400 3 800 2 1600 3200 0k In this instance, therefore, though we begin with 50 in place of 25 facts, we obtain a possible error in excess or defect of 14 years in place of 9^ years. It must be obvious, then, that the errors to which averages de- duced from any given number of facts are liable, will vary with the nature of those facts ; and that the extent of possible error will bear

At first sight the medical observer -would ap- pear to be justified in asserting that under his method of treatment the mortality was at the rate of only 150,000 in 1,000,000 patients, or 15 per cent. But this assertion would be immediately met by the objection that the number of facts is not sufficient to justify this statement, that an average deduced from so small a number as 800 facts can only be re- ceived as an approximation to the truth, and that it requires to be corrected by the aid of the figures in the table. Accordingly, on referring to the column of possible errors corresponding to 800 cases and 120 deaths, we find that the error in ex- cess and defect to which this number of fact;? is liable, amounts to 0*035707, which error must be added to and taken from the 0'150000, the result of actual observation. It follows, therefore, that the true result must be somewhere between the numbers 0-150000 added to 0-035707, or 0-185707, and 0 150000 dim. by 0-035707, or 0-1)4293. The use of this table will be best explained by an example. Let us suppose that a me- dical man, having, for a long time, atlopted a particular course of treatment in a certain malady, has arrived at the following results : 120 deaths, G80 recoveries, 800 cases. The average mortality in this case would * This table is an abbreviation of one given at p. 142. of Gavarret's work, but with additional cal- culations based on the same formula, for the numbers from 25 to 200 inclusive. The formula from which the figures in the column of possible errors have been calculated is, y'2 . m . n in which m represents the number of times that an event A has happened, n the number of times that an event b has happened, and fj. the total number of events: so that m + n = n ; _ the average frc- quency of the events m,as obtained by observation ;and m+ /2. m. n anj i± /2.m.n the limits within which the true average,as corrected by the formula, lies.

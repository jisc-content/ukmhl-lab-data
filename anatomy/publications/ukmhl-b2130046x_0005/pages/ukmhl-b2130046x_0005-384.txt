We concur with these views upon this sub- ject, the more so as we likewise have noticed the pigeon-breast in children where enlarged tonsils have been present. We must not imagine from this that, where there is dyspnoea, there we shall always find the deformity in question; for difficult breathing may be caused by other circumstances than those which dis- turb the counter-pressure of the atmosphere in the thorax. IV. Dimensions of the thorax.—The mea- surement of the thorax may be considered externally and internally; and, what is most remarkable, the one class of measurements may not have any relation to the other class. Moreover, the external measurements bear a certain proportion to the whole frame, whilst the internal do not. (a) External measurements of the thorax.— The external dimensions of the thorax differ much in different men ; this is obvious to all. There is the broad-chested and the nar- row-chested man. Mr. Brent has calculated, from an extensive number of observations, the following proportions, which we arrange thus:— Table D.—Relation of the External Chest to the Height, measured over the Nipples. Minimum chest : a of the stature — JT of the stature = circumference of chest. Medium chest: -J- of the stature 4- of the stature = circumference of chest. Maximum chest: f of the stature = circumference of chest. For example, let us suppose a height of 61 inches, as follows,— Minimum chest: height 61 in., \ = 30"5 in. — e\ = 29'5 in. circumference of chest. Medium chest: height 61 in., i = 30\5 in. + ^ (= 4-07) — 34-57 in. circumference of chest. Maximum chest: height 61 in., § = 40-7 in. = circumference of chest. Thus, by taking the most perfectly propor- tioned chests, either from living figures or from the classical athletae of ancient sculptures, the following is the result. Table E. — External Thoracic Dimensions, (in three classes according to weight) in rela- tion to the height, obtained from calculation. MALES: CIRCUMFERENCE OF THORAX. Height.

We have found from observation, upon 1276 cases of all various classes conjoined, a re- gular arithmetical progression of the thoracic circumference over the nipples in relation to weight. By the total mean of our observations the chest increases exactly one inch for every 10 lbs. increase of weight, sinking the effect of height, which, however, cannot well be omitted, because, as a general rule, the height increases with the weight. Mr. Brent has found that twice the breadth of the shoulders equals the circumference of the thorax over the nipples — i.e. from point to point, or the caliber of the broadest part of the shoulders. Thus, if the caliber be 18 inches, the thorax will be 36 inches in circumference. Four times the distance between the nipples is equal to the circum- ference. Four times the antero-posterior diameter is equal to the circumference : there- fore the distance between the nipples is equal to the depth from before backwards of the ex- ternal thorax. At the height of 5 feet 9 inches this antero-posterior diameter varies from 7i inch, to 12} inches. (b) Internal measurement of the thoracic cavity.—Before entering into details we may observe, that the thoracic cavity is much smaller than we might, perhaps, be led to expect; that the depth from above down- wards is, when compared with the body, very shallow. It is, however, capable of enormous dilatation or mobility, even to 100 per cent; 80 per cent is common. The absolute dimensions of the thoracic ca- vity offemales are obviously smaller than those of males, because they are altogether of smaller conformation, both in stature and weight; but, relatively, the difference is probably little, Although the proportion of some of the diameters may differ, yet that of the total cubic measurements appears not to do so. A certain rude relation of necessity must exist between the size of a man and the dimensions of his thoracic cavity. A man 7 feet high will have a larger chest than one 5 feet or 6 feet high. But there is no constant and uniform relation of the size of the chest, either to the height or weight of

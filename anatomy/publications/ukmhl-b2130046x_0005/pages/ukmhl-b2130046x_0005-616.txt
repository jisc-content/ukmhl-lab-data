1272 URINE. been published by the following observers, viz. Marchand, Simon, Becquerel, Leh- mann, &c. I shall quote several of these from the work of Franz Simon, which has been excellently translated into English by Dr. Day, for the Sydenham Society. Simon analysed two specimens of the urine of a healthy man, 33 years of age. He was of sanguineous temperament. The specific gravity was in the first case 1011, and in the second 1012. 1000 parts yielded — Water ...

The urine of the same individual was also examined under three varying conditions, as follow: —A,on rising in the morning, several glasses of water having been drunk the pre- vious evening ; B, water and some coffee taken, and violent exercise had recourse to during two hours, pulse 100, with occasional intermissions ; C, urine voided half an hour after urine B. These urines were all acid; C most so, and B the least. All three speci- mens were clear, and B the least coloured. The following is the result of the analyses : A. B. c.

Lehmunn has analysed the urine collected during 24 hours, from a well-fed and healthy young man. The following three results were thus obtained by him: — Water - Urea Lithic acid Lactic acid Aqueous ex- tractive Spirituous and alcoholic ex- tractives Lactates Chlorides of so- dium and am- monium Alkaline sul phates - Phosphate of soda Phosphates of lime and mag nesia Mucus - l. 937-682 31-450 1-021 1-496 0-621 10-059 1-897 3-646 7-314 3-765 1-132 0-112 2. 934-002 32-914 1-073 P551 0-591 9-871 1-066 3-602 7-289 3-666 1-187 0-101 3. 932-019 32-909 1-098 1-513 0-632 10-872 1-732 3-712 7-321 3-989 1-108 0-110 The specific gravities of the urines which yielded these above analyses, judging from the amount of solid content, must have been as high as from 1022 to 1029. This is very high, indeed, as an average of 24 hours. The mean composition of urine is stated by Becquerel as follows : — Mean from Mean from four healthy four healthy Men. Women. Specific gravity 1018-9 1015-12 Water - 968-815 975-052 Solid matters - 31-185 24-948 Urea - - - 13-838 10-366 Uric acid 0-391 0.406 Fixed salts 7-695 6-143 Organic matters 9-261 8-033 Simon very properly remarks on the above analyses, that the discrepancies to be ob- served in the composition of the urine, princi- pally depend on the variation in the propor- tion of water ; and that if we consider the pro- portion of each solid constituent to the whole amount of solid matters, the differences will not appear nearly so great. The variations caused in the urine by the ingestion of various mineral substances, and of organic compounds taken either as food or medicine, have attracted the attention of several chemists of eminence. Liebig has theorised freely on this subject, and it is but right that what he has published should be copied into this article, if only as part of the history of the urine, while I would warn the reader carefully to separate in his mind the matters of fact from the theoretical part of the subject, inasmuch as a great deal yet remains to be done. The position of the inquiry is indeed at present such, that further advances may very probably lead us to detect the fallacy of theories which, it is to be feared, the pre-

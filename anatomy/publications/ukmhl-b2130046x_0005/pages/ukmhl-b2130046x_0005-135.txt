STATISTICS. SOI In such instances, there is little appearance of any thing morbid beyond the increase of size. The contained blood is usually very dark, and the spleen shares the deepening of colour. By long duration, the capsule of the organ and the fibrous tissues generally, be- come somewhat thickened, but in other re- spects the texture is little altered. In the second class, in which the swelling is pro- bably produced by a peculiar state of the blood (dyscrasia), and is certainly associated with a class of blood diseases, the texture of the organ is usually much altered. The size of the spleen is often astonishingly increased, so that it possesses a volume of from 100 to 300 cubic inches, and a weight of 10-20 lbs. The increase includes, besides blood, a considerable quantity of a fibrinous material, the nature of which, and its relations to the healthy organ, are at present little known. The colour and consistence are of every possible gradation; from greyish to deep brownish red, or from a soft, friable mass, to a dense, firm, and almost fibrous texture. There is a general relation of these changes to the date and duration of the swelling ; thus in acute or recent cases, the organ is usually soft and of a dark colour, while by long continuance, or in chronic diseases, its consistence is greatly increased, and its colour, as well as that of the contained blood, is much paler or greyer than natural. Atrophy of the spleen, or slow and permanent diminution of its size, is much more infrequent than the preceding converse condition. It is associated with similar varieties of colour and consistence. Inflammation of the spleen. — The peritoneal surface of the organ shares in the diseases of this structure generally, and an inflammation of this part of the serous membrane not un- frequently accompanies the enlargements pre- viously mentioned. The exsudation and re- sults are no way peculiar. Concerning in- flammation of the parenchyma of the spleen little can at present be said. The large and numerous veins which it contains are liable to inflammation, the secondary being the more frequent form of phlebitis which affects them. As regards other morbid products, organ- ised and unorganised, the spleen offers no- thing deserving a special notice. Bibliography. — M.

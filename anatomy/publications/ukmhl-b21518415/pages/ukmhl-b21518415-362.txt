From the lines of incision reflect the different layers downwards to the apex, upwards to the auriculo-ventricular aperture, and backwards into the septum. As the layers are raised the fleshy fibres will be seen to change their direction ; and the outer three to be thimier than the three internal. The LEFT VENTRICLE is a hollow cone, and its wall is fonned of layers of fibres, as if a flat muscle had been rolled up into a conical 103). Seven layers enter into the construction of the wall; and they are arranged figure (fig Fig. 103.^ :ainl •thinnest." Direction of til)res in the three •<juter, ni iildle. And three inner layers. into three external (1, 2, 3), three internal (7, G, 5), and a central one (4). All are not prolonged equal distances on the ventricle, for the outer- most and the innermost reach farthest towards apex and base; and the second exter- nal and its corresponding inner layer (sixth) extend farther than the third and the fifth. The fourth is the shortest of all. Consequently the wall is thickest about the middle third where all the layers are present, and gra- dually becomes thinner up- wards and downwards, xmtil there is only the outennost layer at the apex, and the most external and internal (1st and 7th) at the base. (Dr. Pettigi-ew, Phil. Trans. 1864.) Direction of the fibres. Each stratum is formed of fleshy fibres with the undermentioned direction, supposing the ventricle standhig on the apex, and the anterior surface towards the dissector. In the three external strata (1,2, 3) the fibres are inclined down- wards from the base and septum to the apex of the ventricle, and become less vertical in each. The fourth or mid layer (4) possesses transverse fibres; and it is nearer the outer than the inner surface of the wall. In the three inner strata the fibres change their direction, as is shown by 5, and are directed upwards from the apex and septum to the base of the ventricle ; so that they cross the fibres of the outer layers like the legs of the letter X, and, becoming more oblique in each layer, are almost vertical in the internal. * A diagram of the arrangement of the fibres in layere in the left ventricle. 1.

VESSELS AND DUCT OF LIVER. 513 division is repeated again and again until the last branches of the vein {interlobular, fig. 158, h) penetrate between the lobules ; there they unite, and end in the interior as before explained. In the portal canals the offsets of the vetia xmrtcG are joined by- small vaginal and surface reiii-s, which convey blood from branches of the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery (fig. 159, c), whilst surrounded by the capsule, furnishes vaginal branches, which ramify in the sheath, giving it a red appearance in a well-injected liver, and supply twigs to the coats of the vena porti\3 and biliary ducts, and to the areolar Fig. 159.* tissue : from the vaginal branches a few offsets (capsuku') are given to the coat of the liver. Finally the artery ends in fine interlo- bular branches, fi'om which off- sets enter the lobule, and convey blood into the network between the branches of the vena port;vi and hepatic vein (Chrzonszczew- sky). The hepatic vein (venfe cavaj liepatic(e) begins by a plexus in the interior of each lobule (fig. 158, r7), and its smallest radicle issues from the base of the lobule as the intralobular vein ; these are received into the sublobular branches, which anastomose together, and unite into larger vessels. Finally, uniting with neighbouring branches to produce larger trunks, the hepatic veins fire directed fi-om before backwards to the vena cava inferior, into "which they open by large orifices. The vena3 cavaj hepaticas may be said to be without a sheath, except in the larger trunks : so that when they are cut across the ends remain patent, in conse- quence of their close connection with the liver structure. Hepatic duct (fig. 158, e). The duct commences in the biliary plexus within the lobules. On leaving the lobules the radicles communicate by the interlobular branches (/) ; and the smaller ducts soon unite into larger vaginal branches (fZ), which lie in the portal canals with the other vessels. Lastly, the ducts are collected into a right and a left trunk (fig. 15G, e), and leave the liver at the transverse fissure.f and supplies ^â€¢;^yiual ;uid inter- lobular branches; receives vaginal branches.

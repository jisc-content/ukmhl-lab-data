562 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Branches A. Tlie three branches arisuig from the posterior portion of the Hor pu-r^' internal ihac may be first examined. iiio-iunibar The ilio-lumhar hranch (fig. 174, 7i) passes outwards beneath the lias an psoas muscle and the obturator nerve, but in front of the lumbo- sacral nerve, and divides into an ascending and a transverse branch in the iliac fossa :â€” ascending The ascending or lumbar branch which is beneath the psoas, ^"'^ supplies that muscle and the quadratus lumborum, and anastomoses Fig. 174.* with the last lumbar artery: it sends a small sjiinal branch through the foramen between the sacrum and the last lumbar vertebra, a transverse The transverse or iliac offset divides into branches that ramify in the iliacus muscle, some running over and some beneath it. At the iliac crest these branches anastomose with the lumbar and cir- cumflex iliac arteries; and some deep twigs communicate with the obturator artery, and enter the innominate bone. Lateral The lateral sacral arteries (fig. 174, t) are two in number, superior !a.rt^ies ^^d inferior, but the upper is the larger; they correspond in. situa- * Dissection of the internal iliac artery (Tiedemann). a.

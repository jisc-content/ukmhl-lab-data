DISSECTION OF THE TTERYGOID REGIOX. i)0 Miisculai jiiece DlreciionH. Sliould the internal maxillary artery obstruct tlic view of the nerve, it may be cut through. The SMALLER TART, formed mainly by its cf)ntnl)ntion irom the trunk of the nerA^e, receives nearly all the fibrils of tlie motor root, and ends in brandies for the muscles of the jaw, viz. temporal, masseter, and one ptciygoid ; and for the muscle of the cheek, the buccinator. s„y>i,iios two The deep temporal hranches are furnisluKl to the under sni-- r.miuiral; f^^^ ^1,^ temporal nniscle.

The posterior branch is the smallest, and is often derived from the masseteric nerve ; it is placed near the back of the temporal fossa. The anterior branch supplies the greater part of the muscle, and communicates sometimes with the buccal nerve. The viasseteric branch (-) takes a backward course above the external pterygoid muscle, and through the sigmoid notch, to the imder surface of the masseter muscle : in the masseter the aiervc can be followed to near the anterior border. As tliis branch passes by the articulation of the jaw it gives one or more twigs to that joint. * Deep view of the pterygoid region (Illustrations of Dissections), jifuscles : a.

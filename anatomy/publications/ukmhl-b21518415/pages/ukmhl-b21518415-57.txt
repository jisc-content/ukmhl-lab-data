The mpra-trochlear branch (*) passes inwards above the pulley Branch of the upper oblique muscle, and leaves the orbit to end in the pnUey " eyelid and forehead (p. 7). Before the nerve turns round the Fig. 10.* margin of the frontal bone, it sends downwards a branch of com- nmnication to the infra-trochlear branch of the nasal nerve. Fre- quently there are two supra-trochlear branches ; in such instances one arises near the back of the orbit. The lach-ymal nei've (fig. 10, ^) after entering the orbit in a sejiarate tube of the dura mater, is directed forwards in the outer part of the cavity, and beneath the lachrymal gland to the upper eyelid, where it pierces the palpebral ligament, and is distributed to the structures of the lid. The nerve furnishes branches to the lachrymal gland ; and near * First view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:—a. Su- perior oblique. b. Levator palpebrae. c. External rectus. d.

DISSECTION OF THE PERINiEUM. On the left bc detached in the following way :—On the left side the ejacnlator urinje is to be removed completely fi-om the front of the hgament, and the erector muscle fi'om the crus of the penis. Next, the cms penis is to be detached from the bone; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament, nor to injure, near the pubes, the terminal branches of the pudic arteiy and nerve to the penis. On the light On the right side the dissector should trace out beneath the trans- versalis the offsets of the perinfcal nerve to the deep muscles and the urethra, with the vessels accompanying them. Triangular ligament of urethra. Extent and lonn. Attach- ments. The TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT OF THE URETHRA (fig. 131, ^) (perinatal aponeurosis) occupies the anterior part of the pubic arch, and supports the urethral canal. The ligament is triangular in form, with its base below; and it is about one inch and a half in depth. On each side it is fixed to the pubic arch beneath the crus penis. Its apex is connected with the symphysis pubis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and is partly attached and partly free ;—in the middle line it is connected with the central point of the peri- najum, whilst laterally it is sloped towai-ds the bone, so that it is less deep at the centre than at the sides : connected with the lower * Deep dissection of the perinsenm (Illustrations of Dissections).

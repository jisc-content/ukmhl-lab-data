Structure of the vitreous viass. From the slow escape of the fluid after puncture of the hyaloid membrane, it has been supposed that there are membranous partitions, dividing the \'itreous mass intO' compartments which communicate with each other. In the centre of tlie vitreous body is a fibrous canal, which reaches to the back of the lens, and transmits a branch from the central artery of the retina to the lens capsule in the fetus. The Aatreous mass and the hyaloid membrane are extra-vasciilar, and receive their nutritive material from the vessels of the ciliary processes and retina. Suspensorj/ Urjament of the lens (Zonule of Zinn). This is a trans- parent membranous structure (fig. 233, 0) phaced around the len» capsule, which joins externally the hyaloid membrane opposite the Fig. 233.* is marked l)y folds called ciliaiy processes. Conditiou how altered. Petit: X situation : anterior part saccu- lated. anterior tcrmhiation (ora seixata) of the retina. After the ciliary processes of the choroid coat are detached fi-om it, dark lines of pigment cover the surface ; and when these are washed away plaits {ciliary j^rocesses) come into view, wliich are less prominent and longer than the processes of the choroid coat, and do not quite reach the lens capsule internally. The two sets of prominences are dovetailed together,—the projections of one being received intO' hollows between the other. In this membrane are stiff longitudinal and elastic fibres. The tenseness or laxness is influenced by the state of the ciliary muscle, for during its contraction the membrane is rendered lax by the drawing forwards of the ciliary processes. Canal of Petit. Around the margin of the lens capsule is a small canal (fig. 233, o) abont one tenth of an inch across, which is situate between the suspensory ligament and the fi'ont of the hyaloid mem- brane. When the canal has been opened, and filled Avdth air by means of a blowpipe, it is sacculated at regular intervals, like the * Enlarged representation of the parts of the eyeball on one side opposite the lens: the letters refer to the same parts as in the woodcut, 255. d.

DISSECTION OF THE BEAIX. 186 Origin from cerebrum. Tract of the nerve. The origin of tlie nerve will be afterwards seen to come fi-om the optic thalamus and the corpora geniculata, and from one of the corpora quadrigemina (nates). Tlie tract is the flattened part of the optic winding round the peduncle of the cerebrum. In front it ends in the commissure, and behind it splits into two pieces by Avhich it is fixed to the brain. As the tract reaches forwards it crosses the crus cerebri, to which it is attached by its outer or anterior edge ; and hi front of the Fig. 53.* Its commis- sure. Situation.

The commissure (chiasma) of the nerves measures half an inch, across, and lies on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, within the circle of ^Villis. It is placed in front of the tuber cinereum ; and passing beneath it (in this position of the brain) is- the thin lamina cinerea. In the commissure each tract is resolved into three sets of fibres with the following arrangement:â€”the outer fibres, few in number, are continued straight to the eyeball of the same side.

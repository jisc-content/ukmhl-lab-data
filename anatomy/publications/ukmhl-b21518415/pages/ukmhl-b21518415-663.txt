GEMELLI AND OBTURATOR IXTERXUS. 647 Muscular branches ol the sacral j^lexus are furnished to the ghiteus Muscular maxinius, and to the external rotators except the obturator externus. Branches of gluteus. One or more branches of tlie plexus enter the top of the gluteus maximus (fig. 198). Two branches of the 2)l/''iforniis enter the under surface, and are Branches of learnt with the sacral plexus in the pelvis (p. 567). rynformis. The nerve to the obturator internus (fig. 199, arises fi-om the Nerve of upper part of the plexus, and is directed to its muscle through the small sacro-sciatic notch with the pudic nerve : its termination is seen in the dissection of the pelvis. The nerve to the sur)erior gemellus (fig. 199, ^) is a very small of superior twig, and arises separately fi-om the following: it enters the inner end of the muscle on the superficial surface. The nerve to the inferior gemellus and the quadratus (fig. 199, '') Nerve to is a slender branch, which passes with a companion artery beneath ami quad- the gcmelli and the obturator internus, to end in the two muscles ''^t'^^' from which it receives its designation.

To see the remaining small rotator muscles, hook Clean rota- aside the great sciatic nerve, and take away the branches of the "ii^cies. sciatic artery if it is necessary. In cleaning these muscles the limb should be rotated inwards. The gemelli are to be separated from the tendon of the obturator internus. The surERiOR gemellus (fig. 198, ^) is the highest of the two muscular slips along the sides of the tendon of the obturator ° muscle. Internally it is attached to the outer and lower part of the ischial spine, and externally it is inserted with the obturator into the great trochanter. Oftentimes the muscle is absent. The INFERIOR GEMELLUS (fig. 198, ^) is larger than its fellow. ^^[^^1^^^^ Its origin is connected with the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, along the lower edge or lip of the hollow for the obturator internus muscle ; and its insertion is the same as that of the obturator tendon, '"^^j^^^^^^^ This muscle is placed between the obturator internus and quad- rator. ratus, but near the femur the tendon of the obturator externus comes into contact with its lower border. Action. These small fieshy slips seem to be but accessory pieces ^i^^^^y^^^i.^^'^^ of origin to the internal obturator, with wHch they combine in use. The OBTURATOR INTERNUS (fig. 198, ^) arises from the innominate 9^^"™*°'^ bone inside the pelvis (p. 594), and passes to the exterior through the small sacro-sciatic notch. The tendon of the muscle is directed outwards over the hip joint, and is inserted with the gcmelli into the ^^^^^^}^^'^ upper part of the great trochanter, in front of the pyriformis, as ^"^ ^ Avell as into the contiguous portion of the neck of the femur. Outside the pelvis the obturator is mostly tendinous, and is em- ^}^?^^^'^^ braced by the gemelli muscles in the following way : near the pelvis the gemelli meet beneath, but near the trochanter they cover the tendon. Beneath the obturator is a synovial sac. Crossing the muscle are the large and small sciatic nen'es and the sciatic vessels;

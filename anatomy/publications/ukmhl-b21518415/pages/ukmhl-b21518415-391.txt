INTERVERTEBEAL SUBSTANCE. 375 X (fig. 111). Tliis disposition of the fibres will be best seen on the discs between the lumbar vertebrie ; and it may be rendered evident by dissecting layer after layer. Fig. 112. t Fig. 113.: The central or pulpy portion of the disc (fig. 113, J) is very soft and elastic, and projects when two vertebrte and the interposed mass are sawn through. Placed nearer the back than the front of the disc, it is more marked in the loins and neck than in the dorsal region. It has a yellowish colour, and is deficient in the stratiform arrangement so conspicuous at the circumference. Towards the confines of the two i>ortions of the intervertebral substance, there is an alternating arrangement of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage, though the former is gradually diminishing; but to- Avards the centre a loose fibro- cartilaginous material with large cells preponderates. The surfaces of the vertebra? in contact with the disc, have a cartilaginous covering ; this may be seen by cutting the interverte- bral substance from the bone. Over the centre of the osseous surface it forms a continuous layer, but towards the circumference it consists of separate pieces. The discs are thicker between the lumbar and cervical, than ♦ Intervertebral substance in the himbar region with its laminse displayed. «.

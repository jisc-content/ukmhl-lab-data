759 AUDITORY ELOOD-VESSELS AND NERVE. vertical and horizontal semicircular canals (fig, 247) ; a second ends in the saccule (a) ; and the third belongs to the ampullary swelling (6) on the tube in the posterior vertical semicircular canal. On the sacs the nerve divides, and its filaments separate, some Termination fibrils passing through the otolith and others outside it, and pierce the middle layer of the Avail. Now becoming axis cylinders they l^JlS? divide, and unite in a plexus beneath the epithelium, and are thought to be united with the deep ends of the spindle-shaped cells with hair-like processes. On the amjmllarT/ enlargement of the semicircular tubes the nerA'^e in the tubes enters the external side, where it forms a forked eminence (Steifen- projections sand), coiTCsponding with the projection in the interior. The nerve and, brancii- divides at first into two chief pieces, which are directed to the sides ; -"Jj^ ""^^ and it is doubtful whether filaments extend into the tube beyond those eminences. Finally it pierces the wall of the tube, and fonning a sub-epithelial plexus of nerv^e-fibres, as in the utricle, is supposed to be connected with similar auditorial cells. * Distribution of nerves to the membranoits labyrinth (Breschet). a. Nerve to the saccule, b. Nerve entering the ampullary enlargement on a semicircular tube. c. Branch of nerve entering the large sac or utricle.

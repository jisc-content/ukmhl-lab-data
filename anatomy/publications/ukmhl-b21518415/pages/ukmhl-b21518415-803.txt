These Plates are designed to serve both as patterns for the Student to copy in his dissections, and as aids to him in after-study. For the purpose of carrying out the pictorial representation of dissections, the part of the human Body to be illustrated is divided into suitable stages or regions ; and the muscles, bloodvessels, and nerves of each region are shown in layers in the natural order of succession, so that their mutual connections may be brought before the eye at one and the same time. The Illustrations compri.se views of the Head and Neck, the ujjper Limb, the Perinifiuni, the Abdominal parietes, the Pelvis, and the lower Limb ; and they are accompanied by a concise description of the objects displayed in each Plate, with a short notice of the practical applications of Anatomical facts to Surgery. All the Figures are drawn of life-size from actual dissections ; and they are printed in colours w-ith the object of making them as true pictures as po.ssible of Nature, and more serviceable as copies for the Student to imitate. {List of Plates on oilier side.)

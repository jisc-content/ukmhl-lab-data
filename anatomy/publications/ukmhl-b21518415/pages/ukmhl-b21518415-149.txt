THE CHEEK AND TEETH. 13» The iiuuvua ineiubrane is less sensitive on tlie hard than the soft ].iuiu-of parts bounding the mouth; it lines the interior of the cavity, and •"'^"i"'. IS reflected over the tongue. Anteriorly it is continuous with the tegument, and posteriorly with the lining of the pharpix. The •epithelium covering the membrane is of the scaly variety. cpithuliuiu. Between each lip and the front of the corresponding jaw the differs iu membrane forms a small fold—frajnulum. On the bony part of the roof it blends with the dense tissue (gums) covering the vessels and on loor, nerves. On the soft palate it is smooth and thinner, and along the nuddle of the palate is a ridge which ends in front hi a small [)apilla. In the floor of the mouth the membrane forms tlie fi*a3num floor, lingua) beneath the tip of the tongue, and sends tubes into the openings of the Whartonian and sublingual ducts ; whilst on each :Ki(le of the frfenuni it is raised into a ridge by the subjacent sub- cheek, and lingual gland. On the interior of the cheek and lips the mucous lining is smooth, and is separated fi-om the muscles by small buccal and labial glands. Over the whole cavity, but especially on the lips, are papilla3 for the purpose of touch. The CHEEK extends from the commissure of the lips to the ramus Cheek; of the lower jaw, and is attached above and below to the alveolar extent process of the jaw on the outer aspect. The chief constituent of ^^j^g^*^'*^"' the cheek is the Hcshy part of the buccinator muscle ; on the inner surface of this is the mucous membrane ; and on the outer the integuments, with some nmscles, vessels, and nerves. The parotid <luct perforates the cheek near the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The LIPS surround the opening of the mouth ; they consist chiefly Lips, of the fleshy part of the orbicularis oris muscle, covered externally formed by oroicultiris * by integument, and internally by mucous membrane. The lower lip is the larger and more moveable of the two. Between the muscular structure and the mucous covering lie the labial glands ; and in tlie substance of each lip, nearer the inner than the outer sui'face, and at the line of junction of the two parts of the orl)icu- contains laris, is placed the arch of the coronary artery. artery. Teeth. In the adult there are sixteen teeth in each jaw, which Teeth, are set in the alveolar borders in the form of an arch, and are sur- arrangement rounded by the gums. Each dental arch has its convexity turned in jaw; forwards ; and, commonly, the arch in the maxilla overhangs that in the mandible when the jaws are in contact. The teeth are ; similar in the half of each jaw, and have received the following names :—the most anterior two are incisors, and the one next behind is the canine tooth ; two, still farther back, are the bicuspids ; -and the last three arc molar teeth. Moreover, the last molar tooth ^Ij^^^^g^"*^ .has been called also " dens sapientifE," fi-om the late period of its appearance. The names applied to the teeth indicate very nearly the part they perform in mastication ; thus the incisor and canine Use^in mas- teeth act as dividers of the food, whilst the bicuspid and molar •teeth serve to grind the aliment.

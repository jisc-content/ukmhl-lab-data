629 ANTERIOR CRURA NERVE. The patellar branch springs fi-om the nerve near the knee joint, and a pa- and perforating the sartorius muscle and the fascia lata, ends in the ^^^^"""^ integument over the knee (fig. 190, B. The deep or muscular part of the anterior crural nerve (fig. 195) From the gives branches to all the muscles of the fi'ont of the tliigh, except 'l^^^^ ^'^^ the tensor vaginte femoris ; and it supplies also an offset to one of the adductor muscles, viz., the pectineus. A slender nerve (fig. 193, ^) crosses beneath the femoral artery, iiranchesto and enters the anterior surface of the pectineus : sometimes there P^*^*'"^^^: are two. Brandies to the sartorius are furnished by the middle, or by the sartorius; internal cutaneous ner\^e, whilst it is in contact with that muscle. A nei've enters the under surface of the rectus at the upper part, rectus; and divides into branches as it is about to penetrate the fibres. The nerve to the vastus externus separates into two or more branches vastus ex-^ as it enters the muscle. From one of these an a?'^^■cM?ar• filament is knee joint; continued downwards to the knee joint, which it enters on the ante- rior aspect. The nerve to the' vastus internus (fig. 195) is nearly as large in ^^^g^^'*^*^^ size as the internal saphenous, in common with which it often arises. To the upper part of the vastus it furnishes one or more branches, and is then continued as far as the middle of the thigh, where it ends in offsets to the muscle and the knee joint. Its articular branch is i^rolonged on or in the vastus, and on the with articu- tendon of the adductor magnus to the inner side of the knee joint; kneef^"*^* *° and it is distributed over the synovial membrane on the front of the articulation. This small nerve accompanies the deep branch of the anastomotic artery. A hranch of nerve to the tensor vagince femoris is derived fi'om Nerve of the superior gluteal ; it enters the under surface of the muscle, and vafednse. extends nearly to the lower end. Directions. After the examination of the muscles of the front of Take Mxt the thigh, with their vessels and nerves, the student is to learn the tors', adductor muscles, and the vessels and nerves which belong to them. PARTS ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. The muscles in this position are the three adductors,—longus. The adduc- brevis, and magnus, Avith the gracilis and pectineus ; these have the ^^^^ following position with respect to one another. Internal to all and position. the longest, is the gracilis. Superficial to the others, are the pec- tineus and the adductor longus ; and beneath the last two are the short adductor and the adductor magnus. In connection with the muscles, and supplying them are the pro- Vessels, funda artery (of the femoral) and its branches, with the accom- panying vein. The obturator nerve lies amongst the adductor muscles, and fur- Nen-e. nishes branches to them. Dissection. For the preparation of the muscles, the investing Dissection

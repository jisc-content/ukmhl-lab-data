Special deposits. rounded elevation on the outer jjart of the eminentia teres, about a line above the white cross strife on the floor, and close behind the fovea anterior. The fourth ventricle communicates at the ujii^er part with the tliird ventricle through the Sylvian aqueduct ; and with the sub- arachnoid space of the cord and brain, through an aj^erture in the pia mater inten'^ening between the medulla and the cerebellum : laterally, the ventricular space is extended for a short distance be- tween the cerebellum and the side of the medulla oblongata. The lining of the other ventricles is jirolongcd into this by the aperture of communication with the third. Covering the floor is a columnar epithelium, which is continuous with that in the ujjper part of the central canal of the spinal cord (Clarke). In this ventricle is a vascular foldâ€”choroid j^lexus, on each side, similar to the body of the same name in the other ventricles. It i* attached to the inner surface of the membrane (pia mater) which closes the ventricle between the medulla and the cerebellum, and it extends upwards on the side of the opening into the sub-arach- noid space. Its vessels are supplied by the inferior cerebellar arteiy. Graij matter of fourth ventricle. The gray matter forms a sur- face-covering for the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is continuous- below with the gray commissure of the cord, and extends upwards- to the aqueduct of Sylvius (p. 195). The special nuclei have beeii referred to already (p. 229).

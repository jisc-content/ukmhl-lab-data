7T EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. municatiiig branches of the cervical nerves. After tlic union of the with ceni- spinal nerves, oft'sets are supplied to the depressor muscles of the os ^"'^^ "erves hyoides, viz., onio-liyoid (botli bellies), sterno-hyoid, and sterno- thyroid : sometimes another offset is contiinied to the thorax, -where it joins the phi-enic and cardiac nerves. The connection between the descendcns noni and the spinal I'y iuter- ner\'es is formed by two or more cross filaments, so as to con- lathi'g"" .struct an arch with the concavity upwards ; and an interchange '"Ji'iis- of fibrils between the two nerves is supposed to take place. The EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTJ:RY (Hg. 17, (I) spruigS from the bi- Extenml furcation of the connuon carotid' at tlie upper borde^- of the tliyroid vel-'jji''^ cartilage, and furnislies branches to the neck, the face,^.^nd the outer parts of the head. ^ From, the place of origin it ascends in front of the mastoid pro- Extent. cess, and ends near the wnd\^e n^^lie jaw in the interrlal maxillary and temporal branches. The arterj^ lies jxt first to the in'^er side of course ami the internal carotid^ but it aftenvards 'l^^ecomes superficifil to that ^^'I'^^^tion. vessel ; and its direfci||Dn is som'ewhat arched forwards, though the position would be marked sufficiently by a line from the front of the meatus of the ear to t^^^ crifcoid cartilage. At first the externalÂ»^r/)tid is overlaid b^ the sterno-mastoideus. Parts super- and by the common coverings of the antwj^jr triangular space, viz. ^^'^'^^ the skin, and the 9*periicial and deep fascioj with the platysma. But above the level ofjtfihe fxom the mastoid process to the hyoid bone, the artery is crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and still higher the parotid gland conceals it. At its beginning the arteiy rests against the i^liarynx ; but above the angle of the jaw it beneath it, is placed over the styloid jorocess and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, which sei)arate it from the internal carotid. To the imier side of the vessel at first is the pharynx ; and still higher, are the ramus ami on inner of the jaw and the stylo-maxillary ligament. Veins. There is not any companion vein with the external carotid Veins in as with most arteries ; but sometimes a vein, formed by the union the urten'^' of the temporal and internal maxillary branches (p. 29), will accom- pany it. Near the beginning it is crossed by the facial and lingual l)ranc]ies joining the internal jugular vein ; and near the ending the external jugular vein lies over it. Nei~ves are directed from behind forwards over and under the 'i'"^ nerves, artery. At the lower border of the digastric muscle tlie hypo- glossal lies over the vessel, and near the ending the ramifications of the facial nen^e are superficial to it. Three nei-ves lie beneath it : beginning below, the small external laryngeal ; a little higher, the superior laryngeal ; and near the base of the jaw, the glosso-pharyngeal. The branches of the external carotid are numerous, and arc [^f^j^^.j^^,^ classed into an anterior, posterior, and ascending set. The are anterior set comprise branches to the thyroid body, tlie tongue, anterior, and the face, viz. superior tliyroid, lingua], and facial arteries. In the posterior set are the occipital and posterior auricular posterior, branches. And the ascending set include the ascending pharyu-aufi ascend-

DISSECTION OF THE EAR. extremity is clilated, and the posterior part projects farther than tho anterior ; the greater portion of the margin is rough, and gives at- tachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is smaller, and is marked in the dry bone by a groove for the msertion ot the membrane of the tympanmn ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall juts beyond the posterior by about two lines. In the fetus the osseous part of the meatus is absent. After birth it grows out of the osseous ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. Lining of the meatus. A prolongation of the integument lines the auditory passage, and is imited more closely to the osseous than Fiff. 23G.* glands. the cartilaginous portion ; it is continued over the membrane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pellicle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue of the carti- Cemminous laginous part of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow- brown colour, resembling in form and arrangement the sweat glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices : they are absent in the osseous part, and are most abundant in that portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. Vessels ami nerves. The meatus receives its arteries fi'om the pos- terior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the temporal branch of the external carotid. Its nerves are derived fi'om the auriculo-tem- poral branch of the fifth nerve, and enter the auditoiy passage be- tween the bone and the cartilage (p. 91). * Vertical section of the meatus auditorius and tympanum (Scai*pa). a.

The inner has its head is fixed by a narrowed tendon to the anterior snrface of the Sm''*' lirst piece of the sternum; and the outer head has a wide lieshy audXvicle, attachment to the sternal third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are directed upwards, the internal passing backwards, Fig. 15.* •and the external almost vertically, and are blended about the middle of the neck in a roundish belly. Near the skull the nmscle aiui inser- ends in a tendon, which is inserted into the mastoid process at the i^i^''^^ outer aspect from base to tip, and by a thin aponeurosis into a rough surface behind that process, and into the outer part of the upper curved line of the occipital bone. The muscle divides the lateral surface of the neck into two rosition to triangular spaces. On its cutaneous aspect the sterno-mastoid jg other parts. * View of the anterior triangular space of the neck (Quain's "Arteries"). 1. Sterno-mastoideus. 2. Sterao-hyoideus. 3.

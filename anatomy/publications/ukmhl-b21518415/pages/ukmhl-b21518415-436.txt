420 DISSECTION OF THE PERIN.EUM. and nerves of the liollow are the mferior hfeniorrhoidal vessels and nerve (6), in the space. branches o£ the pudic. At the anterior part, for a short distance, are two superficial perinteal nerves (-) (of the pudic) ; and at the posterior part is a small branch of the fourth sacral nerve (^), with cutaneous offsets of the sciatic vessels (c) and nerve (■*) bending round the gluteus. Into this space the surgeon sinks his knife in the first incisions in the lateral operation of lithotomy ; and as he carries it from First cut in lithotomy enters this space.

Connected with the lower end of the rectum are four muscles, viz. a fine cuticular muscle, and two sphincters (external and internal) with the levator ani. Corrugaior cutis anif (fig. 129, ^). This thin subcutaneous layer of involuntary muscle surrounds the anus Avith radiating fibres. Externally it blends with the subdermic tissue outside the internal sphincter ; and internally it enters the anus and ends in the sub- mucous tissue within the sphincter. * A view of the dissection of the rectal half of the iierinfeum (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: a. External sphincter, b. Oorrugator cutis, only- part left. c. Intei-nal sphincter. D. Levator ani. e. Gluteus maximus. Arteries: a. Trunk of the pudic artery, b. Inferior hajmorrhoidal. c.

NERVES IN BASE OF SKULL. other nerves ; but when it is about to enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, it sinks below the fourth and a part of the fifth, and divides into two branches. ' Near the orbit the nerve is joined by one or two delicate fila- passes to ments of the cavernous plexus (p. 20). The FOURTFi NERVK (fig. 4, courses forwards, like the pre-Tiochicai- ceding, to one muscle in the orbit. It is the smallest of the " Fig. 4.» nerves in the wall of the sinus, and is placed below the third ; but as it is about to pass through the sphenoidal fissure it rises higher than all the other nerves. In the wall of the sinus the fourth nerve is joined by twigs of in the wall the sympathetic ; and it is sometimes united with the ophthalmic trunk of the fifth. Fifth Nerve (fig. 4, This nerve is distributed to the face Trifacial and head, and consists of two parts or roots—a large or sensory, two roots, and a small or motory. The large root of the nerve passes through an aperture in the La^sc root, * Cranial nerves in the base of the skull. The dura mater has been removed in the middle fossa, on tlie left side, to show the nerves in the wall of the cavernous sinus, and especially the ganglion, and the three trunks of the fifth nerve. Each nerve, except the first which is absent, is marked by its corresponding numeral. On the right side the dura mater is untouched, f OflFsets to the dura mater from the fifth nerve.

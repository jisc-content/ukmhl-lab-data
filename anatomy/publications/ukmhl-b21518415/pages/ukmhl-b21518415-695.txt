PLANTAR VESSELS AND NERVES. 670 Tlie internal artery (&) is inconsiderable in size, and accompanies internal the internal plantar nerve, under cover of the abductor pollicis, as ' far as the middle of the foot, where it ends in four superficial digital amuLiing.' branches.

The artery furnishes muscular branches, like the nerve, Brnnciies to the abductor pollicis and flexor digitorum pcrforatus, and to the 'â€¢ flexor brevis pollicis and the two internal lumbricalcs.

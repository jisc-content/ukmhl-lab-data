SINUSES OF CRANIUM. 13 of which it gives a small slip. In it is contained the occipital contains sinus. occipital sinus. The SINUSES are venous spaces between the layers of the dura Sinuses of mater, into which blood is received. All the sinuses open either into a large space named torcular Herophili, opposite the occipital protuberance ; or into the two cavernous sinuses on the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone. A. The TORCULAR Herophili (fig. 3, a) is placed in the tentorium, Occipital opposite the centre of the occipital bone. It is of an in-egular cdves Fig. 3.^ shape, and numerous sinuses open into it, viz., the superior longi- tudinal above, and the occipital below; the straight in front, and the lateral sinus on each side. The superior longitudinal sinus has been already described (see superior p. 10). The inferior longitudinal sinus (fig. 3, c) resembles a small vein, inferior lon- and is contained in the lower border of the falx cerebri at the 8Â»tuduuii. posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and the larger brain, and ends in the straight sinus (d) at the edge of the tentorium. The straight sinus (fig. 3, d) lies along the middle of the ten- Straight torium, and seems to continue the preceding sinus to the common point of union. Its form is triangular, like the superior longi- tudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of the large brain, and some small veins from the upper part of the cerebellum. The occipital sinus (fig. 3, g) is a small space in the falx cere- Occipital belli, which reaches to the foramen magnum, and collects the blood ^"^ from the occipital fossfB. This sinus may be double. The lateral sinus (fig. 3, e) is the channel by which most of tlie Lateral * Some of the sinuses of the skull, a. Torcular Herophili. h. Superior longitudinal sinus, c.

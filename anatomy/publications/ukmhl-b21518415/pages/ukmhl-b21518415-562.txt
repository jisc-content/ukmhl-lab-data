The PELVIC FASCIA is a thin membrane in close contact witli the obturator muscle, and is fixed to the bone around the attachment of the fleshy fibres, so that it might be called the special fascia (obturator) of that muscle. Superiorly it is fixed into the brim of the pelvis for a short distance at the lateral aspect of the cavity. In fi'ont of that spot it does not extend so high as the brim, hut is inserted into the bone around the attachment of the muscle, except opposite the hole for the obturator vessels and nerve, where it is united with the obturator membrane. Inferiorly the fascia is attached to the hip bone along the side of the pubic arch, and to the margin of the great sacro- sciatic ligament where .the obturator internus issues fi'om the pelvis. The outer surface of the fascia is in contact with the obturator muscle. The inner surface con-esponds above with the cavity of the pelvis, and below, with the ischio-rectal fossa. With this surface the thin membrane (recto-vesical) supporting the viscera of the pelvis is united; the place of union being indicated, on looking into the pelvis, by a whitish line near to, and on a level with the ischial spine. At the posterior border of the obturator muscle the fascia is joined by a thin membrane (fascia of the pyriformis) which covers' the pyriformis muscle and the sacral plexus, but is beneath the iliac vessels by branches of wliich it is perforated. The recto-vesical fascia may be now seen in part ; but it will be better displayed after the hip bone has been taken away. Dissection. To obtain a side view of the pelvis it will be necessaiy to detach the left innominate bone. Tlie pelvic fascia is first to be separated from the bone and the obturator muscle. The innominate bone is next to be sawn through, in front, rather external to the symphysis, and, behind, at the articulation with the sacrum. After the bone has been pulled somewhat away from the rest of the pelvis, the ischial spine with the recto-vesical fascia attached to it may be cut off with a bone-forceps ; and the rest of the bone may be then removed by cutting through the pyriformis muscle, the vessels and nerves passing through the sacro-sciatic notch, and any other structure that may retain it. A block is afterwards to be placed beneath the pelvis. The bladder is to be moderately distended with air through the ureter, and the urethra is to be tied. Some tow is to be introduced into- the rectum, also into the vagina if it is a female pelvis ; and a small piece is to be placed in the pouch of peritoneum between the bladder and tlie rectum. After the viscera are thus made pro- minent, the ischial spine and the recto-vesical fascia should be raised

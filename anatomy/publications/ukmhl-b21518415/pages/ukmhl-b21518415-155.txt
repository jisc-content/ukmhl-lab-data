OLFACTORY NERVE. 13Â» The olfactory nerve differs in structure from tlie other cranial Structure, nerves ; for its branches are deficient in the white substance of Scluvaiui, are not divisil)le into fibrilhe, and are nucleated and granular in texture. They resemble the ganglionic fibres: and .seem to consist of an extension of the nerve substance of tlie olfactory bulb. The other nerves in the nose will be described in tlie following section. Blood vessels. For a statement of the different vessels of the nose, see p. 143. The arteries form a network iji the pituitary membrane, and a large subnuicous plexus on the edge of each of the two ]f)wer spong}' bones, especially on the infen'or. The ?'emshave a plexiform disposition like the arteries, and this is largest on the lower spongy bone and the septum nasi. Blood-ves- sels of llOHCt arteries. venis. Section XIV.

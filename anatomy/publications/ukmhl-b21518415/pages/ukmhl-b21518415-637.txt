SAETORIUS MUSCLE. 621 The SARTORius (fig. 194, ^) is the longest muscle in the body, Sartorius; and extends from the pelvis to the leg. It arches over the front of the thigh, passing from the outer to the inner side of the limb, Fig. 194.* and lies in a hollow between the extensor on the one side, and the adductors on the other. Its origin is tendinous from the upper anterior iliac spinous pro- origin; cess of the hip bone, and from about half the interval between this and the inferior process. The fibres constitute a riband-like muscle, course over the thigh ; * Surface view of tlie front of the thigh, the teguments and fascia being removed (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: a.

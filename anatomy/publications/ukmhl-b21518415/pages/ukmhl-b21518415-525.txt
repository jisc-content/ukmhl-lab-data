LOBES AND FISSURES OF LITER. 609 The Spigelian lobe, d, lies behind the transverse fissure, and Spigelian, forms a roundish projection on the surface. On its left side is the longitudinal fissure ; and on its right, the vena cava inferior. The caudate lobe, e, is a slight, elongated eminence, which is and caudate directed from the Spigelian lobe behind the transverse fissiu-e, so as to form the posterior boundary of that sulcus. Where the fissure terminates this projection subsides in the right lobe. Fissures. Extending horizontally half across the right part of Three the liver between the Spigelian and caudate lobes on the one hand, and the square lobe on the other, is the transverse or portal fissure. Fig. 156.* It is situate nearer the posterior than the anterior border, and con- rortai or tains the vessels, nen-^es, ducts, and lymphatics of the liver. At t™'^^'^^'"^®' the left end it is united at a right angle with the longitudinal fissure. The longitudinal fissure, F, extends from the froiit to the back of longitudl- the liver, between the right and left lobes. In the part anterior ' to the transverse fissure lies the remnant of the umbilical vein (c), which is called round ligament, and is oftentimes arched over by a i^iece of the hepatic substance (pons hepatis). In the part behind that fissure is contained a small obliterated cord (d), the remains of the vessel named ductus venosus in the fetus. The groove for the vena cava is placed on the right side of the one for the Spigelian lobe, and is frequently bridged over by the liver. If the cava be opened, two large and some smaller hepatic veins will be obser\'-ed entering it. Fossce.

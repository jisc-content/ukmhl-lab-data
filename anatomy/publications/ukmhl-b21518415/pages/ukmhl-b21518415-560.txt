The arteries of the right side lie beneath the vena cava. The dorsal branch continues to the Back between the transverse processes, and supplies an offset to the spinal canal (pp. 398, 415). The ahflominal hranches are directed outwards beneath tlie quad- ratus lumborum, and enter the posterior part of the abdominal wall, Avhere they anastomose with the lower intercostal above, and with the circumflex iliac and ilio-lumbar arteries below : these branches supply the psoas and quadratus muscles ; and the last furnishes an offset to the teguments with the iho-hyijogastric nerve. The LUMBAR VEINS are the same in number, and have the same course as the arteries. Commencing by the union of a dorsal and an abdominal branch at the root of the transverse process, each trunk is directed forwards to the vena cava. They open into the posterior part of the cava, either singly, or conjointly with those of the opposite side. On the left side the veins are longer than on the right, and pass beneath the aorta. Around tlie transverse processes, and beneath the psoas muscle, the lumbar veins communicate fi-eely with one another, with the ilio-lmnbar, and sometimes with the common iliac, so as to form a jilexus of veins. Issuing from the upper part of the plexus is a small branch, the ascenclimj lumbar rein, which joins the azygos vein of the coiTespondhig side of the body.

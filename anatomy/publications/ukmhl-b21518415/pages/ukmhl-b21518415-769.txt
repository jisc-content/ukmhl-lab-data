753 COMPOSITION OF SEPTUM COCHLEAE. sharply round, and presents a free margin (b) (the edge of the axis). In the recent bone the tube is divided into two main passages Tube divided (scahi2) by the septum (fig. 244, c). In the dry bone a remnant of '^^^ this partition is seen in the form of a thin plate of bone,—lamina spirahs, projecting from the axis ; and on the outer wall is a slight groove, opposite the ridge of bone. Septum of the spiral tube (fig. 245). Tlie partition in the recent Septum bone dividing the tube of the cochlea into two passages, consists of n°em-^'^ an osseous and a membranous portion :— brauous. The osseous pai-t (^), formed hy the lamina spiralis, extends about Osseous half way across the tube. Inf eriorly it begins in the vestibule, where ^'^^'^" Fi?. 215.* it is wide, and is attached to the outer wall so as to shut out the fenestra rotunda from that cavity ; and diminisliing in size ends above in a point,—the hamulus, opposite the last half turn of the cochlea. Between the hamulus and the axis is a space, which is ends above converted by the membranous part of the septum into a foramen (fig. 244,/) (hiatus, heUcotrema), and allows the intercommunication arurture. of the two chief passages of the cochlear tube. The lamina spiralis is formed by two plates of bone, wliich en- Lamina close canals for vessels and nerves, and are separated farthest from '^P^''^'* * A (lia'Tam of a section of the tube of the cochlea enlarged (modified from Henle).

705 MOVEMENTS OF KNEE AND PATELLA. Flexion and extension. Each of these movements may be divided into stages for the purpose of particularizing clianges in its direc- tion. Inflexion the tibia with its fibro-cartilages moves backwards round Flexion, the end of the femur; and its extent is limited by the extensor Movenient muscle, and by the meeting of the calf of the leg with the thigh. ^ ' For the anterior third of the movement the tibia is directed down cii'iuKpin and in along the oblique curve of the inner condyle, giving rise to rotation inwards of that bone; but for the posterior two thirds, the tibia passes straight back over the condyles. All the external ligaments are relaxed, except the anterior; and state of both crucials are put on the stretch towards the end of flexion. ligaments. In extension the tibia is carried forwards until it comes into a Extension, straight line with the femur, when the uniting ligaments prevent of tibia^^^ its farther progress. In the hinder two thirds of the movement the tibia has a straight course course over the condyles of the femur ; but in the anterior third the ' ' ° " leg-bone is directed up and out over the oblique curve of the inner condjde, and is rotated out.

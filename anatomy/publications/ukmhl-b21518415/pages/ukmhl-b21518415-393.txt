LIGAMENTS OF VERTEBK-Sl. 377 Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are si)ecial librous ligaments in the corresponding situation (see p. 172). Ligaments of the spines. Along the tips of the spinous processes Ligaments of the dorsal and lumbar vertebra is a longitudinal band of fibres ^P"'*''" {fig. 115, —the supraspinous ligament. It is thickest in the Fig. Ill* Fig. 115.t lumbar region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres; the former reach over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons of the muscles. The band of the ligamentum nuchas, which is composed of fibrous tissue, takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin membranous inter- andbe- spinous ligaments (fig. 108, which reach from the root to the ^""^^ ^^^^^ tip of the spinousjprocesses. The strength of these bands is depen- dent upon the interval they fill; they are more marked in the lum- bar than the other vertebrae, and they are least strong in the cervical region. Ligaments of the transverse x>rocesses. In the loins the inter-trans- Ligameiits verse ligaments are thm membranous bands in the intervals betwecji processes, the processes. In the dorsal vertebrae they are round bundles of fibres (fig. 115, ^). And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there. * An inner view of the neural arches of the vertebtiB, with their interposed ligaments.—1 and 2.

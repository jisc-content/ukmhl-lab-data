Taking the course of the nerve through the infi-aorbital canal, the vessel appears in the face beneath the elevator muscle of the upper lip ; and it ends in branches, which are distributed, ends ill like those of the nerve, to the parts between the eye and mouth. f"<^e; ^YiQ face its branches anastomose with the facial and buccal orbit,'"^^ arteries.

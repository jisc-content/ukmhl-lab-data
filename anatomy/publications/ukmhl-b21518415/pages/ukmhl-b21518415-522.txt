Tlie spleen is a vascular sj^ongy organ of a bluish or purple colour, sometimes approaching to gray. Its texture is friable, and easily broken under pressure. The use of the spleen is unknown. The viscus is somewhat elliptical in shape, and is placed vertically against the great end of the stomach. Its size varies much. In the adult it measures commonly about five inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and one inch to one inch and a half in thickness. Its weight lies between four and ten ounces, and is rather less in the female than the male. At the outer aspect it is convex towards the ribs. The inner surface is marked by a longitudinal ridge, nearer the posterior than the anterior border, into which the vessels phuigc to ramify in the interior. Before and behind the ridge, the surface is flattened or somewhat hollowed. The spot where the vessels enter is named the hilum of the spleen. The anterior border is thinner than the posterior, and is often notched. Of the two extremities, the lower is more pointed than the upper. Small masses or accessory spleens (splenculi), vaiying in size from a bean to a moderate-sized plum, are fotmd occasionally, near the tissiu'e of the spleen, in the gastro-splenic omentum, or in the great omentum. Structure. Enveloping the spleen are two coverings, a serous and a fibrous. It is formed hy a network of fibrous or trabecular tissue, wliich contains in its meshes the splenic pulp, with the Mal- pighian corpuscles. Throughout the mass the bloodvessels and the nerves ramify. No duct exists in connection with this organ. The serous or j^^ritoneal coat incases the spleen, and covers the surface except at the hilum and the posterior border. It is closely connected to the subjacent fibrous coat. fibrous coat (tunica propria) gives strength to the spleen, and forms a complete case for it. At the fissure on the inner surface this investment passes into the interior with the vessels, to which it fumishes^sheaths: and if an attempt is made to detach this coat, namerous fibrous processes will be seen to be connected with its inner surface. Its colour is whitish ; and its structure is made up of areolar and elastic tissues. Dissection. Tlie spongy- or trabecular structure will best appear, by washing and squeezing a piece of fresh bullock's spleen under water, so as to remove the grumous-looking material. The trabecular tissue (tig. 155) foi-ms a network through the whole interior of the spleen, similar to that of a sponge, which is joined to the external casing, and forms sheaths around the vessels. Its pro- cesses or threads are white, flattened or cylindrical, and average from yl^th to ^.^^th of an inch: they consist of fibrous and elastic tissues, with a few muscular fibres. The interstices communicate freely to- gether, and contain the proper substance of the spleen, and the vessels.

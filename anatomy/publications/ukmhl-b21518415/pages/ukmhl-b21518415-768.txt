A central )iillar or axis: for displaying tlie vestibule; or this section ma}'- be made on an- other tenif)oral bojie in which the semicircular canals arc not laid bare. For the same dissection in the recent state, a softened bone should be used. The cochlea (fig. 244) is conical in form, and is lolaced almost horizontally in front of the vestibular space. The base of this body is turned to the meatus auditorius internus, and is perforated by small apertures; whilst the apex is directed to the inner wall of the tympanum, opposite the canal for the tensor tympani muscle. Its length is about a quarter of an inch, and its width at the base is about the same. Resembling a spiral shell in construction, the cochlea consists of a tube wound round a central part or axis; but it differs from the shell in having its tube subdivided by a partition. The axis or modiolus (fig. 244, o) is the central stem which sup- ports the windings of the spiral tube. Conical in shape, its size Fi?. 244.* 7/t-. is conical; and porous.

The axis is perforated by canals as far as the con- tracted part in the last half turn, and the central one is larger than the others ; these transmit vessels and nerves in the fresh state. The spiral tube forms two turns and a half around the stem, and terminates above in a closed extremity named tlie cupola. When measured along the outer side, it is about one inch and a half long. Its diameter at the beginning is about one tenth of an inch, but it diminishes gradually to half that size towards the opposite end. Of the coils that the tube makes, the first is much the largest; this projects towards the tympanum, and gives rise to the emiitence of the promontory on the inner wall of that cavity. The second turn is included within the first coil. The last half turn bends * Section through the cochlea (Breschet). a. Axis with its canals & Infundibulum or enlarged upper end of the axis. c.

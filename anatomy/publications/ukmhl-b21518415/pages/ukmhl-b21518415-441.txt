425 PERIN^^AL AETERY AND NEEVES. Air blown beneath the fascia passes foi'wards to the scrotum ; course of and this direction is given to it by the deep connections of that membrane with parts around. Should urine be eiiused beneath the urine, superficial fascia, the lluid will necessarily be directed forwards, like the air, through the scrotum to the penis and the front of the abdomen. Dissection. The superficial vessels and nerves are to be dissected Dissection on the right side of the perimeum, by cutting through the super- afui vessels ficial fascia in the same manner as on the left side. The long ^j'^^^''^'''* slender artery then visible is the superficial perinajal, which gives a transverse branch near its connnencement. Two superficial perinteal nerves accompany the artery ; and the inferior pudendal nerve is to be traced forwards to the scrotum. Communications are to be sought between these nerves anteriorly, and between one of the perinfeal and the inferior ha^morrlioidal posteriorly ; and all the nerves are to be followed backw^ards. Artekies (fig. 130). The superficial and transverse perinasal Superficial arteries beneath the fascia are branches of the pudic, and are two pu<iic.'' or three in number. The superficial periimal branch (fig. 130, i), arising at the fore Superficial part of the ischio-rectal fossa, runs over or under the transverse i^''^'^"''^'^^ muscle, and beneath the superficial fascia to the back of the scrotum, where it ends in fiexuous branches. As the vessel lies ends in internal to the pubic arch, it supplies ofiisets to the muscles beneath ; ^"^t*^^"^' and in fi-ont it anastomoses with the external or superficial pudic branches of the femoral artery.

The transverse artery of the perina3um (fig. 130, a) arises fi'om Transverse the precethng, and is directed transversely to the nuddle of the ^^'t*^^T- perinatal space, where it is distributed to the integuments and the muscles between the urethra and the rectum. It anastomoses with the one of the opposite side. Branches of veins accompany the arteries, and open into the Veins witli tnmk of the pudic vein: those with the superficial perina;al artery aiteries. are plexifonn at the scrotum. Nerves (fig. 130). There are three cutaneous nerves of the scrotum Cutaneoiis on each side, viz. inferior pudendal of the small sciatic, and two super- scrotum, ficial perinatal branches of the pudic nerve.

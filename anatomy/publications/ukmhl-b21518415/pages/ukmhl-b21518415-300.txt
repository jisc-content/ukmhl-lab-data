Small branches of the ulnar artery and median nerve may be seen entering the under surfaces of those muscles. For the present, the pronator teres may be left uncut. Superficial The FLEXOR DIGITOKUM SUBLIMIS vel TERFORATUS (fig. 80, is the Tnilr^.^ largest of the muscles of the superficial layer, and is named from Origin. its position to another flexor in the deep layer. It arises from the inner condyle of the humeras and the internal lateral ligament, and from the intermuscular septa in common with other muscles : it takes origin in addition from the bones of the forearm, viz. from the inner part of the coronoid process of the ulna; fi-om the oblique line below the radial tubercle; and fi'om the anterior margin of the radius as far as, or one or two inches below the insertion of the pronator teres. Kather below the middle of the forearm the muscle ends in four tendons, which are continued beneath the annular liga- insertion. ment and across the hand, to be inserted into the middle phalanges of the fingers, after being perforated by the tendons of the deep flexor. Connections The flexor sublimis is concealed by the other muscles of the aroumL^^ superficial layer ; and the radial vessels lie on the attachment to the radius. Along the inner border is the flexor carpi ulnaris, with the ulnar vessels and nerve. The tendons of the muscle are arranged in pairs before they pass beneath the annular ligament of the wrist;— the middle and ring finger tendons being anterior, and those of the index and little finger posterior in position. On dividing the coro- noid and condyloid attachments, the nuiscle will be seen to cover two flexors of the deep layer (flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis), the median nerve, and the upper part of the ulnar artery. Use on Action. This flexor bends primarily the middle joint of each .tingerb, finger ; and is then able to bring the nearest phalanx towards the pahu in consequence of being bound thereto by a sheath. But when the nearest plialanx is fixed by the extensor of the fingers, it remains straight whilst the superficial flexor moves the second phalanx. and wrilt. ^^^^ fingers are bent the muscle Avill help in flexing the wrist and elbow joints.

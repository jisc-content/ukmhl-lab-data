DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 518 arc con- voluted, and end; inch, and ai-e surrounded by a capillary plexus of bloodvessels (fig. 164 A). At the one end (farther) each tube is dilated into the Malpighian corpuscle (/>) ; and at the other it passes into a straight tube or joins an " arch " at the base of the pyramid.

The blood- vessels. tubes" of Henle (fig. 1G2) have the same arrangement as the larger tubuli uriniferi in the cortical substance. The wall of the convoluted tubes consists of a thin basement membrane, and is lined by a thick, nucleated, and granular epithe- lium. Malpigliian corpuscles (fig. 164, a). These small bodies are con- nected with the free ends of the convoluted tubes, one to each : and are arranged in double rows in the cortical substance between the pjTamids, one row being on each side of an iiiterpyramidal branch of artery, fi"om which they receive twigs ; each measures about YY^th of an inch, and consists of an incasing capsule with an enclosed tuft of bloodvessels (glomerulus). The capsule (i) is the dilated end of the convoluted tube, and is perforated at the extremity by two small bloodvessels. Its wall consists of a thin basement membrane, and is lined by a transparent laminar epithelium. The glomerulus (fig. 164, b) is formed by the intercommunications * Plan cf the arrangement of the luiniferal tubes, a. Tube at its ending in the pjTamid. h.

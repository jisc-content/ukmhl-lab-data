757 STEUCTURE OF MEMBRANOUS SACS. otolith (h) opposite the entrance of the nerve ; it is also filled by endolymph, which is continued into the canal of the cochlea through the ductus reuniens. Structure of the sacs. The wall of the sacs of the membranous Wall of labyrhith is translucent and firm ; but it is more opaque where the three vessels and nerves enter it. Three strata enter into its construction, strata: together with bloodrvessels and nerves. The outer fibrous covering is loose and flocculent, is easily outer, detached, and contains irregular pigment cells with ramifying Fig. 2i6* blood-vessels. The middle stratuni (tunica propria) is clear and middle, tough, like the hyaloid membraiie in the interior of the eyeball: its inner surface is irregular owing to slight eminences ; and in the ampulla of the semicircular tube this layer forms the transverse projection. The inner one is formed by a layer of flattened inner, nucleated cells, which are continued over the eminences in the interior. In the region of the nerve, both in the ampulla of the semicircular canal and in the sacs, the epithelium is said to become columnar, and to have intermixed spindle-shaped nucleated cells (hke the olfactorial), which possess hair-hke processes at their free ends. The small calcareous masses, or the otoliths, consist of minute, otoliths elongated, six or eight-sided particles of carbonate of lime, which oniy^g'" are pointed at the ends, and are situate in the inner part of the wall of the utricle and saccule. Within the enlargement of each semicircular tube there is also a calcareous material. * Petrous bone partly removed to show the membranous labjTinth in place (Breschet). a.

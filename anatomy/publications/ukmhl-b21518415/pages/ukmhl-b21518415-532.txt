The upper extremity of the kidney is rounded, is thicker than the lower, and is surmounted by the suprarenal body. The lower end is flat, and more pointed. The position with respect to the spinal column has been before detailed (p. 472). On the anterior surface the viscus is rounded, but on the opposite surface it is generally flattened. The outer border is convex; but the inner is excavated, and is marked by a longitudinal fissure,—hiJum. In the fissure the vessels are thus placed with respect to one another :—Tlic divisions of the renal vein are in fi-ont, the ureter is behind, and the branches of the artery lie between the two. On the vessels the nerves and lymphatics ramify ; and areolar tissue and fat surround the Avhole. Opposite the fissure is a hollow in the interior of the kidney, named sinus^ in Avhich the vessels and the duct are contained before they pierce the renal substance. Dissection. To see the interior it will be necessary to cut through the kidney from the inner to the outer border ; and to remove the loose tissue fi'om the vessels, and fi-om the divisions of the excretory duct. The hollow or sinus containing the bloodvessels now comes completely into view. The interior of the kidney (fig. IGl) appears on a section to consist of two diiferent materials, \iz.. of an external granular or cortical part; and of internal, darker coloured, pyramidal masses, which converge towards the centre. But these unlike-looking parts are con- structed of urine tubes, though with a diflierent arrangement. The pyramidal masses (d) (py- ramids of Malpighi), are twelve or eighteen in number, and converge to the sinus of the kidney. The apex of each mass, which is free fi-om cortical covering, is directed to the sinus, and ends in a smooth, rounded part, named mamilla or painlla (c). In it are the openings of the urine tubes, which are about twenty in number, some being situate in a central depression and the others on the surface ; and it is surrounded by one of the di\a- excretoiy tube. Occasionally two of the The base is em- Fig. 161. sions (calyx) of the masses are united in one papillary termination. * Section through the kidnej^ showing the medullary and cortical portions and the beginning of the ureter, a.

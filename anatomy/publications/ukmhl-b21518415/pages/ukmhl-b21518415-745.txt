CILIARY MUSCLE AND IRIS. 729 <-oi'nea ; its iibrcs are directed backwards, and are inserted into the <^-horoid coat opposite to, and rather behind the cihary processes. The nerves to the iris pierce it. The circular fihres'J^Qi\m\y ligament, fig. 229, (1) are internal to circular the radiating, and form a ring about -^jfi^ of an inch wide around the edge of the iris : they are not attached to the sclerotic or the cornea. Use. The radiating fibres of the muscle draw forwards the fore Action, part of the choroid coat, and the ciliary processes, and thereby relax the suspensory ligament of the lens. The circular fibres are isaid to compress the outer part of the lens. The IRIS (fig. 229, c) is a vascular and muscular structure, about ins is vai . . . cular and half an inch in diameter, whose vessels are continuous with those nmscular. of the choroidal coat. Its position and connections may be observed in the different dissections that have been prepared. Placed within the ring of the ciliary muscle, it is suspended in front Situation, of the lens (fig. 225,/), and is pierced by an aperture for the trans- mission of the light. It is circular in form, is variously coloured Form, in different persons, and is immersed in the aqueous humour. By its circumference it is connected with the choroid coat and the Attach- posterior elastic layer of the cornea. The anterior surface is free ^ '. \iitcrioi' in the acpieous humour, and is marked by lines converging towards surface the pupil. The posterior surface is covered with a thick layer of posterior, pigment (fig. 225), to which the term uvea has been applied. The aperture in it (fig. 229) is the pupil of the eye ; this is Tlie central slightly internal to the centre, and is nearly circular in form, but its size is constantly varying (from -^-^yth to ^ of an inch) by the ■contraction of the muscular fibres, according to the degree of light dieting on the optic nerve.

The stroma of the iris is composed of fibres ■of areolar tissue, arranged circularly at the circumference, and as ' radiating bundles passing like rays towards the pupil. In it are involuntary muscular fibres, both circular and radiating, together with pigment cells. Vessels and nerves ramify through the tissue. Muscular Jibres. The sphincter of the pupil (fig. 227, d) is a narrow Muscular hand about /oth of an inch wide, which is close to the pupil, on yjScter the posterior aspect of the iris.

The movements of the iris are involuntary and regulate the admission of light into the ball.

Anteriorly it communicates by a funnel-shaped passage (infundibulum) with the frontal sinus and the anterior eth- moidal cells ; and near its middle is a small aperture, which leads into the cavity of the upper jaw. The wferiormeatusX^g. 31, ^) is straighter than the middle one, and rather exceeds the width of the included space on the outer wall ; Fi-. 31. and when the bone is clothed by the mucous membrane it extends still farther fonvards. In its fi-ont is the opening of the ductus ad nasuin. Occasionally there is a small fourth or rudimentary meatus above the rest (fig. 31, ''), which communicates with a posterior ethmoidal cell. The nares. In the recent condition of the nose each fossa has a distinct anterior opening in the face, and another in the phar}-nx ; but in the skeleton there is only one common opening in front for both sides. These apertures, and the parts bounding them, have been before described (pp. 30 and 12G). The mucous membrane lining the nasal fossa is called the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane : and from its blendinc: with the peri- nose. . osteuin it acquires much strength. It is continuous with the in- tegument at the nostril, and with the membrane lining the pharynx through the posterior opening: moreover, it is also continuous with the mucous membrane of the eyeball, and with that of the different sinuses, viz. frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary.

This condyloid articulation is jDrovided with an up and down, a to and fro, aiid a lateral movement. Iji depressing the jaw, as in openmg tlie mouth, the articular con- dyle moves forwards till it is placed under the convexity at the fore part of the articular hollow, but the interposed concave libro- cartilage gives security to the joint. Even with this provision, a slight degree more of sudden motion throws the condyle oil the prominence of the temporal bone into the zygomatic fossa, and gives rise to dislocation. In this movement the fore and lateral parts of the capsule are made tight; and the fibro-cartilage is drawn forwards with the con- dyle by the external ptcrj-goid nuisclc. When the jaiv is elevated and the mouth closed, the condyle and the fibro-cartilage glide back into the glenoid fossa. In i\m posi- tion the jaw is placed in the state of greatest security against dis- location. The ligaments and the surrounding muscles, which were stretched in the previous movement, are then set at rest. * Ligaments of the jav-â€”an inner view (Bourgery and Jacob). 1.

RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS. contiguous to the scalenus, to the vertebral vessels, and to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Action. Both muscles bend forwards tlie neck ; and the upper Use. oblique fibres of one will turn the neck and head to the same side, by the attachment to the atlas. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MAJOR (fig. 45, ^) is external to the Reotus preceding muscle, and is largest at the upper end. Its origin is by mijor'^ pointed tendinous slips, with the longus colli, from the summits of oriyiu. the anterior transverse processes of four cervical vertebrii) (sixth, Fig. 45.* fifth, fourth, and third) ; and the fibres ascend to be inserted into insertion, the basilar jorocess of the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum. The anterior surface of the muscle is covered by the pharynx, Connec- and by the carotid arteiy and the numerous nerves near the base '""^ of the skull. The muscle partly conceals the following one. At its insertion the rectus is flesliy, and reaches from the middle line to the temporal bone. Action. Both muscles incline forwards the head ; and one will Uso. bring the face to the same side by rotating the head. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MINOR (fig. 45, is a small flat Rortus muscle, which arises ixom the anterior transverse process and body ininor is. * Deep muscles of the front of the neck and the scaleni muscles.

STEUCTURE OF THE COLON. 503 Ileo-cacal valce (fig. 153). This valve is situate at the entrance situation of of the ileum into the caecum. It is composed of two pieces, each ^^^^ ^''^^^'^ • with a dilferent inclination, which project into tbe interior of the j^^jP'*^^'^'* CtBcum, and bound a narrow, nearly transverse aperture of com- munication between the two differently-sized portions of the alimen- tary canal. The upper piece of the valve, ileo-colic (e), projects horizontally One iieo- into the large intestine, opposite the junction of the ileum with the ^"^'^' colon. And the lower piece, ileo-ccecal (/), which is the lai'ger of the other the two, has a vertical direction between the ileum and the c.ecum. ^j^^g^*^^^' At each extremity of the opening the pieces of the valve are blended joined at together ; and the resulting iDrominence (r/) extends transversely on each side of the intestine, forming the//-a;«a or retinacula of the f"yn;°^"^ valve. The size of the opening depends upon the distension of the Openiug in Intestine ; for when the retinacula of the valve are stretched the ^^"^ margins of the apertm-e are approximated, and may be made to touch. Each piece of the valve is formed by circular muscular fibres of The valve a the intestinal tube, covered by mucous membrane ; as if the ileum ofttiew^aU^ was thrust obliquely through the wall of the' Ctccum, after being of gut. deprived of its peritoneal coat and layer of longitudinal fibres. This construction is easily seen on a fresh specimen by dividing the peritoneum and the longituchnal fibres, and gently drawing out the ileum from the caecum. The opening of the cq^pewHx into the caecum {d) is placed below Appendix that of the ileum. A piece of mucous membrane partly closes the clecum."'^'^ aperture, and acts as a valve. Folds or ridijes are directed transversely in the interior of the gut. Ridges in and correspond with depressions on the outer surface : these folds ^^'^^^' result fi-om the doubling of the wall of the intestine, and the largest how 1 1 formed, enclose vessels. Structure of the Colon. The coats of the large are similar to Four strata those of the small hitestine, viz., serous, muscular, fibrous, and of the gut. mucous. Serous coat. The peritoneum does not clothe the large intestine, ^.919^^ - in PI (.litters 0,1011^ throughout, m the same degree. It covers the front or the Ccccum, tlie iutes- and the £ront and sides of the ascending and descending colon ; but in neither does it reach commonly the posterior aspect (p. 475). The transverse colon is incased like the stomach, and has intervals along the borders, wher(j the transverse meso-colon and the great omentum are attached. The muscular coat is formed by longitudinal and circular fibres, Two layers as in the small mtestme. libres; The longitudinal fibres may be traced as a thin layer over the longitudinal surface, but most are collected into three longitudinal bands, about a quarter of an inch in width. On the vermiform appendix the ^yj^^^jj fibres form a uniform layer ; but they are continued thence into the bands on the cajcum and colon : on the rectum they are dif- and rectum fused over the surface. When the bands are divided the intestine

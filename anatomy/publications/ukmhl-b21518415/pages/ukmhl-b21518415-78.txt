DISSECTION OF THE NECK. neck corrcsiioiidiiig with some of the branches of the superficial .-liters artery. In some bodies the vein may cover tlie artery; and the liohi 1011. i)i-anches joining it above may form a kind of plexus over the upper part of the eonnnon carotid. Nerves with Nerves in the space. In coimection, more or less intimate, with tiie artene:j. ^j^^ large vessels, are the following nerves witli a longitudinal direction:—In front of the sheath lies the descending branch of the hypo-glossal nerve; within the sheath, between the carotid artery and jugular vein, is the pneumo-gastric nerve; and behind lying along the sheath is the sympathetic nerve. Along the outer part of the vessels the spinal accessory nerve extends for a short distance, till it pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle, and erossiiig Several nerves are placed across the vessels:—thus, directed tiiein. transversely over the tv,-o carotids, so as to form an arch below the digastric muscle, is the hypo-glossal nerve, which gives downwards its branch (descendens noni) most commonlj^ in front of the sheath. Appearing on the inner side of the carotid arteries, close to the base of the space, is the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, Avhich courses forwards between them. Inside the internal carotid artery, opposite the hyoid bone, the superior laryngeal nerve comes into sight; whilst a little lower down, with the descending branches of the thyroid artery, is the external laryngeal branch of that nerve. Gianils; Glands in the. space. Two glandular bodies, the submaxillary, hiiimiaMl- ^^^^ thjToid,have their seat in this triangular space of the neck. The submaxillary gland is situate altogether in front of the vessels, and is partly concealed by the jaw; and beneath it on the surface of the mylo-hj'oideus is the small nerve to that muscle, with the bo'dy'''™'^^ submental artery. By the side of the thj-roid cartilage, between it and the eonnnon carotid artery, lies the thja-oid body beneath the sterno-thyroid nmscle: in the female this body is more largely developed than in the male. Tarotici At the base of the space, if the ]iarts were not disturbed, would ■ be the parotid gland, Avhich is wedged into the hollow between the jaw and the mastoid process, and projects somewhat below the level of the jaw. Its connections have been noticed at p. 28. Directions. T\w student has to proceed next with the examina- tion of the individual parts that liave been referred to with the triangular spaces. 'uih'rvein interior jugular vein. This small vein occupies the middle line of jnfeuar\Ln ^^^^ y^^^]-^ j^„fi j^f, ^ize is dependent upon the degree of development of the external jugular. Beginning in some small branches below the chin, the vein descends to the sternum, and then bends out- wards beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, to open into the sub- joins subcia-clavian vein, or into the external jugular. In the neck the Man vein. {^,^^e,.ior ^nd external jugidar veins commmiicate. There are two anterior veins, one for each side, though one is usually larger than the other ; and at the bottom of the neck they are joined by a transverse branch.

SPECIAL PARTS IN TYMPANUM. 743 between the meatus aTiditorius and the cavity of the tympanum, tympani; It measures one third of im inch across, is oval in form, and is adidV attached by its circumference to a groove at the inner end of the auditory passage ; but in the fetus it is fitted into a separate osseous and the ring, the tympanic bone. The membrane is phaced verj^ obhquely . so that it forms \vith the floor of the meatus an angle of 45 degrees, ' and the outer surface is directed downwards. Towards the auditory surfaces, canal the surface is concave ; but in the tympanum it is convex, and attached to its upper half is the handle of the malleus (6),— one of the ossicles. Structure. The membrane is formed of three strata,—external, i*'-^ formed internal, and middle. The outer one is continuous with the integu- lar, cpithe- ments of the meatus auditorius; and the ^'^^^ inner is derived from the mucous membrane Fig- 238.* of the typanum. The middle layer is formed _^ fibrous of white and yellow fibrous tissues, and is ^/ a stiatum. fixed to the groove in the bone. From its centre, where it is connected with the handle of the malleus, fibres radiate towards the circumference; and near the margin, at the inner surface, lies a band of stronger circular fibres (fig. 238, c), wdiich bridges across the notch at the upper part of the tympanic bone. The Eustachian tube (fig. 236, e) is the channel through which Eustar-liian tUDP Ills / the tympanic cavity communicates with the fauces. It is about an ' ,y/ inch and a half in length, and is directed do^vnwards and inwards to the pharynx. Like the meatus auditorius, it is partly osseous and partly cartilaginous in texture. The osseous part is rather more than half an inch in length, and is narrowed at the middle. Its course in the temporal bone is along gj^^jj^j^,^ the angle of union of the squamous and petrous portions, outside the passage for the carotid artery. Externally it ends in a dilated ^^'^j*^""'" and somewhat oval opening, with an ii-regular margin, which gives attachment to the cartilage. The cartilaginous part of the tube is nearly an inch in length, cartilagi- and extends fifom the temporal bone to the interior of the phaiynx (p. 126). Throuffh this tube the mucous membrane of the drum of the car Use of the o tube, is continuous with that of the pharynx ; and through it the mucus escapes. The secondary membrane of the tympanum is placed within the ?^^'^f",|g™j^^^ fenestra rotunda, and is rather concave towards the tympanum, rotunda:' but convex towards the cochlear passage which it closes. It is formed of tlu-ec strata, like the membrane on the opposite side of the cavity, viz. an external or mucous, derived from the * Inner view of the membrana tympani in the fetus with the malleus attached, a.

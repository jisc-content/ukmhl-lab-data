BOUNDARIES OF AXILLA. 241 Avhich are constructed by the muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior fold are the two pectoral muscles, The pector but these take unequal shares in its construction, in consequence of fl'iut^"* the difference in their size and shape :—thus the pectoralis major ' A extends over the whole front of the space, reaching fi-om the ■clavicle to the lower edge of the anterior fold ; whilst the pectoralis minor B, which is a narrow muscle, corresponds only with the middle third of the space. In the posterior boundary, from above Fig. 69.* "downwards, lie the subscapularis f, the latissiraus dorsi miiscle D, «.nd the teres major E : this boundary reaches farther out than the ai"! latissi- nnterior, especially near the humerus ; and its lower margin, which a'nd^subswi- as formed by the latissimus dorsi, projects forwards beyond the level of the subscapularis. On the inner side of the axilla lie the first four ribs, with their P^iis at tue , ' inner una mtervenmg intercostal muscles, and the part or the serratus magnus ■c taking origin from those bones. On the outer side the space has outer sides. * View of the dissected axilla (Ilhistrations of Dissections.) Muscles: A. Pectoralis major, b. Pectoralis minor, c. Serratus magnus. D. Latissimus dorsi.

249' BRACHIAL PLEXUS. be cut across below the second rib,*' and to be drawn down with hooks ; and their thoracic branches may be removed at the same time. A dense fascia is to be cleared away from the large nerves of the plexus. The BRACHIAL PLEXUS results fi-om the union of the anterior Nerves branches of the four lower cervical nerves with the first dorsal (in brachial part) ; and a slip is added to it above fi-om the lowest nerve in I'l'^^^'s. the cervical plexus. It is placed partly in the neck, and partly in ^^'^ situation the axilla, and is di^'ided opposite the coracoid process into large trunks for the supply of the limb. The part of the plexus above the clavicle is described in the dissection of the head and neck (p. 72). The part below the clavicle has the same connections with the sur- and connec- rounding muscles as the axillary artery. The nerve trunks interlace in it generally in the followmg manner :— At first the plexus consists of two bundles of nei-ves, which lie Tiie nerves on the outer side of the JfrteryT-aod are thus constituted ;—the one cords*^'^'^^ nearest the vessel is formed by the last cervical with the part of the first dorsal nerve; and the other, by the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical neiTes. A little lower down a third or posterior cord is produced by the union of two fasciculi, one fi-om each of the other bundles ; so that, beneath the small pectoral muscle, the plexus con- around the .sists of three large cords, one being on the outer side, another on the inner side, and the third behind the vessel. Occasionally there may be some deviation fi-om the above mentioned an-angement. The branches of the plexus below the clavicle arise from the and give several cords in the following way :— vlz.'^''^'*^''" The outer cord gives origin to one anterior thoracic branch, the from the musculo-cutaneous trunk, and the outer head of the median ner\^e. obiter. The inner cord produces a second anterior thoracic nerve, the i""cr, and inner head of the median, the internal cutaneous, the nerve of Wrisberg, and the ulnar nerve. The posterior cord furnishes the subscapular branches, and ends posterior in the circumflex and musculo-spiral trunks. ' Onlv the thoracic and subscapular nerves arc dissected to their ^^'^ foUow- , •111 • 1 '11'*^ seen, tennination at present ; the remannng neiwes will be seen m the viz., aim. The anterior tJioracic branches (fig. 70, ^ and ^), two in number, two anterior- are named outer and inner, like the cords from which they come. '^i'^*-'^' The outer nerve crosses inwards over the axillary artery, to the o^^t^r under surface of the gi-eat pectoral muscle in which it ends. On the inner side of the vessel it communicates with the following branch. The inner thoracic branch turns upwards between the artery and and inner, vein, and after receiving the offset fi-om the other, ends in many branches to the under surface of the pectoralis minor. Some twigs enter the gi-eat pectoral muscle, after passing either through the pectoralis minor or above its border. The subsccqndar nerves are three in number, and take their names Ti^^^J^^^J^l'- from the muscles supplied :— * The student must be careful not to cut tlie vessels higher than the spot mentioned, otherwise he will injure the dissection of the neck.

MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 180 Finally this fasciculus throws itself into the pneumo-gastric nerve outside the skull. (See p. 112.) The spinal part is firm and round, like the third or the sixth spinal: nerve, but only a small piece of it can be seen. It arises by a number of fine filaments from the lateral column of the spinal cord near the lateral fissure, as low as the sixth cervical nerve. As the nerve ascends along the side of the cord it lies between the ligamen- tum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, with the upper of which it may be connected ; and it finally enters the skull bv the foramen macrnum. All three nerves converge below the crus cerebelli, and rest on all converge a small lobe of the cerebellum (flocculus). From that spot they are directed outwards to the foramen jngulare (p. 19). The fibrils of the nerves pierce the medulla ; and each nerve, except the spinal part of the last, takes origin fi'om a special deposit of gray matter at the back of the medulla oblongata, and near the lower angle of the fourth ventricle (p. 229).

The MXTii or HYrooLOSSAL nerve of Willis (twelfth nerve, Sum- Ninth nerve, merring) (') is placed on" the front of the medulla oblongata, and arises by a series of filaments from the sulcus between the pyra- midal and olivary bodies, in a line with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves.

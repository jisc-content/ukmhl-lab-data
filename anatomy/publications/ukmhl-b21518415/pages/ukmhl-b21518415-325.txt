The different compartments of the annular ligament may be seen Sheaths of more completely by dividing the sheaths of the ligament over the i^g°JjJent •several tendons passing beneath. There are six diflEerent spaces, and each is lubricated by a synovial membrane. The most external ^'^^"jj^^^^j one lodges the first two extensors of the thumb. The next is a large hollow for the two radial extensors of the wrist ; and a very .small space for the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb follows on the ulnar side. Farther to the inner side is the common sheath for the extensor of the fingers, and that of the fore finger ; And then comes a separate compartment for the extensor of the little finger. Internal to all is the space for the extensor carpi ^"^^^^^ ^ ulnaris.

The ligaments of the remaining articulations of the Directions, limb, which are still moist, may be examined at once ; but if any of them have become dry, they may be softened by immersion in water, or with a wet cloth, whilst the student learns the others.

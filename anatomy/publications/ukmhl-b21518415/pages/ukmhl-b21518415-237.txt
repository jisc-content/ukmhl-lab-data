221 FIBRES OF CEREBRUM. to the fibres continued throughout, viz. from the crus to the surface, some unite the peduncle of the cerebrum with the ganglia, and others coimect the ganglia with the convolutions on the exterior. Their source. The fibres thus entering inferiorly the cerebrum through its peduncle, and continued thence to the periphery of the hemisphere, are derived from the component pieces of the medulla oblongata except the restiform body (fig. 57), viz., fronx anterior pyramid, lateral column and olivary body, and posterior pyramid (p. 191) : they serve to connect the spinal cord with the cerebrum. The decussation between opposite sides has been before referred to <p. 194). The transverse or commissural fibres connect the hemispheres of 65.* 8ource froni cord. Decussa-' tiou. Commissii ral trans- verse liljre!:- the cerebi-um across the middle line. They give rise to the great commissure or the corpus callosum (p. 209) : and to the anterior and posterior commissures (p. 217). Those bodies have been already examined. Longitudinal fibres. Other connecting fibres pass from before commis- backwards, uniting together parts of the same hemisphere. The ^"'{^Jjal"^' chief bands of this system are the following, the fornix, the tccnia fibres, semicircularis, and the peduncles of the pineal body.

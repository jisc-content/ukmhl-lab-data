PATCHES OF PEYER. 499 ileum. Placed on all parts of the intestine, and even on or between the valvule conniventes ; they are covered by the villi of the mucous membrane, and are surrounded at their circumference by apertures of the crypts of Lieberkiihn. They are closed lymph Compo- follicles beneath the mucous coat, which project into the gut; and they arc formed of a network of reticular connective tissue with lymph-corpuscles between the meshes. Fine capillaiy vessels per- meate the mass ; and it is surrounded by a plexus of lymphatic vessels. The fflands of Peyer (fig. 151, (glandute agminata;) exist Patches of chiefly in the ileum, in the form of oval patches, which measure ^^^^^' from half an inch to two inches or more in length, and about half an inch in width. They are situate on the part of the intestine size: opposite to the attachment of the mesentery, and their direction is situation; longitudinal in the gut: usually they are from twenty to thirty in number. In the lower part of the ileum they are largest and most mimher; numerous ; but they decrease in number and size upwards from r^^^^i^'^" that spot, till at the lower part of the jejunum they become in-egular in form, and may consist only of small roundish masses. The mucous membrane over them is hollowed into pits (fig. 150, &), and is generally destitute of villi on the subjacent follicles (fig. 151, '^), but between the pits it has the same characters as in other parts. A patch, when examined by the microscope, appears to be but a Composition collection of lymph folhcles like the « solitaiy glands" (fig. 151), o^^i^^^tch: * A.

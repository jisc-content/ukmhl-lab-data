Lastly, a wide muscle of the cheek closes the space between the jaws. Fig. 6.* Sphincter of the mouth consists of two parts, inner or circular, not fixed to tone. Outer irregiilar, The ORBICULARIS ORIS MUSCLE (lig. 6, surrounds the opening of the mouth, and is united with the several muscles acting on that aperture. It consists of two parts, inner and outer, which differ in the appearance and aiTangement of the fibres, like the sphincter muscle of the eyelids. The inner part (fig. 5,'), whose fibres are pale in colour and fine in texture, forms a rounded thick fasciculus, which corresponds with the red margin of the lip. The fibres of this portion of the muscle, unattached to bone, blend with the buccinator at the corner of the mouth, and some pass from lip to lip. The outer part is thin, wide, and more irregular in form, and is connected with the subjacent bone, besides its union with the * 1. Occipito-frontalis, anterior belly ; 4. Posterior'.belly. 2.

ULNAR ARTERY AND BRANCHES. 285 with muscles. voins. Veins. Two companion veins are situate on the sides of the artery, Position of and join freely over it. ^"^"^^ Nerves. The median nei-ve lies to the inner side of the vessel and nerves^ for about an inch, but then crosses over it to Fis- 81-* gain the outer side. About the middle of the forearm the ulnar nerve (■*) ap- proaches the artery and continues thence on the inner side. In the knver half it has p '^:lML #^><dr ) Lower half a straight course to the pisifonn bone, and is covered by the teguments and fascia, and the flexor carpi ulnaris as far as the wrist. To the outer side are the tendons of the flexor sublimis. Beneath it is the flexor profun- dus, c. Veins. Two companion veins accompany the ar- tery, as in the upper part, and are united across it at inten^als. Nei-ves. The ulnar nerve (■•) lies close to, and on the inner side of the vessels ; and a small branch (^), sending twigs around the arter)-, courses to the palm of the hand. On the annular ligament of the wrist the artery has passed through the fascia and lies close to the pisiform bone. The ulnar ners^e, with its palmar branch, still ac- companies the vessel on the inner side. Branches. The greater its branches number of the collateral offsets of the artery are distributed to the '^^'^ muscles. But the named branches are the following :— * Dissection of the deep layer of muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two layers of muscles of the forearm.

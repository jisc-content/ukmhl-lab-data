Arising from the neural arch of attaoii- the atlas, the muscle is inserted, close to the middle line, into the ^^^^^^^ > inferior cur\'-ed ridge of the occipital bone, and between this and the foramen magnum. connec- This small muscle is fan-shaped, and is deeper than the rectus ^'""^^" major : it covers the ligament between the atlas and the occipital bone.

Both muscles, or one, will have the same use, viz., to Use. approach the occiput to the atlas. The OBLIQUUS INFERIOR (fig. 119,*^) slants between the first two P^%^"'f vertebrae. It arn^ses from the spinous process of the axis, external to the rectus major muscle, and is inserted into the tip of the trans- attach- j. ,1 ,1 ments. verse processes or the atlas. Action. One muscle turns the face to the same side by rotating Use of one;. the atlas on the axis. If both muscles act at the same time they of both, will assist in keeping the head straight. The OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR (fig. 119, ^) takes origin from the upper Obliquus part of the transverse process of the atlas, where the preceding ^^^1^®"°'^' muscle terminates ; and is directed inwards to be inserted between attach- incuts' the curved lines of the occipital bone, near the mastoid process. This muscle is concealed by the complexus and trachelo-mas- connec- toideus, and crosses the vertebral artery. Its insertion is beneath the splenius (e), but above the rectus major muscle. Action. With its fellow the upper oblique will assist in carrying Use of both; backwards the head. By the action of one muscle the occiput will of one. be inclined backwards to the same side. The SEMisriNALis (fig. 119, ^) occupies the vertebral groove in Semispinaiis the dorsal and cervical regions, and extends from the transverse-^^q^''^^''^ and articular processes to the spines of the vertebrfc: it is undivided at the outer, but bifurcated at the inner attachment. It arises externally from the transverse processes of the ten upper dorsal vertebra?, and fi-om the articular processes of the four lower cervdcal ; and it is inserted by two pieces, as below:— The lower piece, semvipinalis dorsi, is inserted into the spinous semi-spina- processes of the upper four dorsal and the last two cervical l^'i^^f vertebrae. The upper piece, semispinaiis colli, is inserted into the spines of semi-spina- the cervical vertebra? above the attachment of the semispinaiis dorsi, ^ the atlas not receiving any slip. The semispinaiis muscle is covered by the complexus, and the conncc- deep cervical artery. Some of the cei-vical nerves are supex-ficial, and others beneath it. To its inner side is the multifidus spina) muscle. Action. The muscles of both sides acting together will extend the Use of both; spine. One muscle will rotate the cendcal and dorsal parts of the of one iiiiisclc spine, so as to turn the face to the opposite side. * The INTERSPINAL MUSCLES are placed, as their name expresses : interspinal they are an-anged in pairs, one on each side of the interspinous li"p^ir^ ligament ; and they are best seen in the neck and loins.

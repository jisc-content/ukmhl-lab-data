In the upper part of the axilla the A-essel is deeply placed, Init it becomes superficial as it approaches the arm. Its connections with surrounding parts are numerous ; and the description of these will be methodised by dividing the artery into three parts—one above, one beneath, and one below the small pectoral muscle. Above the small pectoral muscle the artery is contained in the axillary sheath of membrane, e. This part is concealed by the clavi- cular portion of the great pectoral nmscle. Behind it are the * Second view of the dissection of the thorax (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles : A. Pectoralis major, cut. b. Pectoralis minor, c. Serratus magnus. D. Subclavius. e.

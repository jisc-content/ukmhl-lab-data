DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 698 a capsule. and tendons. Bones in the kuee joint. Capsule, obscure or conceal the ligamentous bands. In the knee a kind of aponeurotic cajisule is to be defined on the fi-ont of the joint. Some tendons, namely, tliose of the biceps, popliteus, adductor magnus, and semimembranosus, are to be followed to their insertion, and a part of each is to be left. Articulations of the knee. The knee is the largest hinge joint in the body, and is formed by the contiguous ends of the tibia and femur, with the patella. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, and arc maintained in apposition by strong and numerous ligaments. The cajysule (fig. 214) is an aponeurotic covering on the front of the joint, which closes the wide intervals between the anterior and Fig. 214.* Fig. 215.+ how formed, the lateral ligaments ; and is derived from the fascia lata united- Avith fibrous offsets of the extensor and flexor muscles It covers the anterior and the external lateral ligament, being inserted below mto the heads of the tibia and fibula ; and it blends on the inner side with tlie internal lateral ligament. It is not closely applied to the synovial membrane, but it is united below with the interarticular nbro-cartilages. Dissection. Four external ligaments, anterior and posterior, inter- nal and external, ai-e situate at opposite points of the articulation The posterior and the internal lateral ligament will appear on the removal of the ai^olar tissue from their surfaces ; but the anterior and the external lateral are covered by the aponeurosis on the fore part of the joint, and will not be laid bare till this has been cut + Internal ligament of the knee joint (Bourgery).â€”!

CHARACTERS OF FIBROUS COAT. 723 Fibrous coat of the eyeball. The outer casing of the eye eon- f-sists of an opaque hmder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior transpai-ent portion, the cornea. The SCLEROTIC (cornea opaca) is the firm, whitish, and opaque portion of the external stratum of the eyeball, wliich supports the ••••more delicate structures within. Dissection. To examine the inner and outer surfaces of this layer -it will be necessary to cut circularly with a scissors through the cornea close to the sclerotic, and to remove the cornea from the -front of the eyeball; on piercing the cornea the aqueous fluid escapes Fig. 225.* Fibrous coat. Sclerotic part. Dissection to see the interior. from the containing chamber. The other structures may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 225, a) is bell-shaped, and Form ami extends from the entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming about five sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one tenth Aportiues of an inch), the optic nerve (/) is transmitted through an aperture in it : this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is ■cribriform wlien the nerve is drawn out—the lattice-like condition w* Diagram of a horizontal section of the eychall. and d, the cornea, h.

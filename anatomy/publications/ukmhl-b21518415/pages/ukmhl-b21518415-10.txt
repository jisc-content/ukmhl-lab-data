vi PREFACE. Since the publication of the last edition great changes have been made in textural Anatomy; and the chief of these, for which I am indebted to Quain's Anatomy, I have introduced into my account of the microscopic structure of the different organs. In this edition, as in the preceding ones, I have endeavoured to make the work more complete by the correction of inaccu- racies, and to render it more efficient as a guide to practical work.

The cells filling the loculi of the stroma in the cortex, are micleated with oil globules and fine granules ; and being packed in masses, they take on a polygonal form : they measure about the In the medullary portion the cells resemble those of the cortex, except that they do not contain oil particles ; and they are rather larger and more granular, measur- ing about YoJoy^h of an inch. Bloodvessels. Numerous arteries are fur- nished to the suprarenal body fi'om the diaplu-agmatic and renal vessels, and fi-om the aorta. In the interior the arteries ramify in the cortex along the septa be- tween the cell masses; and, fi-equently anastomosing together, end in a fine capil- lary network, with elongated meshes, around the loculi. In the medullary part the fine arteries are distributed through the stroma. The veins originate in capillary plex- uses ; and the several radicles, uniting in large branches which pass through the centre of the medullary part, are collected finally into one trunk ; this opens on the right side into the vena cava, and on the left into the renal vein. Other smaller veins pass out through the cortex to the renal vein and the vena cava. Nerves. The nerves are very nimierous and large, and pass in- Avards along the septa of the cortical part: branching, they extend between the cortical and medullary parts in the layer of areolar tissue, and in the medullary substance they fonn a network in the areolar structure, but their ending is unknown. Lymphatics are superficial and deep, and both join those of the kidney ; the arrangement of the deep is undetermined.

A serous sac partly surrounds each organ. To see the Dissection.

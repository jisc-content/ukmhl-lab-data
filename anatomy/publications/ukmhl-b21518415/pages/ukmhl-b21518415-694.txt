About the centre of the foot the muscle ends in four small tendons, which are directed forwards over the tendons of the long^ flexor, and entering the sheaths of the four smaller toes, are inserted divides into into the middle phalanges. In the sheath of the toe the tendon of four toes.tliis muscle lies at first, (in this position of the foot) on the long flexor; opposite the centre of the metatarsal jihalanx it is slit for the passage of the other, and is attached by two processes to the Insertion, sides of the middle phalanx.

DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 614 Vessels have surrounded by its covering of areolar tissue, together with an in- a sheath. guinal gland ; and if a piece of the areolar casing be cut out over both the artery and the vein, there will be an appearance of two thin partitions, the one being situate on the inner side of the vein, separating this vessel fi-om the gland, and the other (+) between the vein and the artery. A fatty stratum stretches over the upper aperture of the sheath, closing it towards the abdomen. Interior of ihe crural sheath (fig. 192). The sheath is said to be divided into three compartments by two partitions ; and the posi- Fig. 192.* Contents of the sheath. Space divided into three parts: tlic inner is tlie cniral canal. tion of the so-called septa has been before referred to,—one being internal to the femoral vein, and the other between the two large vessels. In the outer compartment is contained the femoral artery (a), lying close to the side of the sheath ; in the middle one is placed the femoral vein (h) ; and in the inner space (crural canal) only a lymphatic gland (c) is situate. The crural canal (fig. 192) is the innermost space in the interior of the crural sheath :—Its length is about a third of an inch, and it reaches from the base of Gimbernat's ligament to the upper part of the saphenous opening. It decreases rapidly in size fi"om above down, and is closed below. The aperture by which the space com- municates with the cavity of the abdomen is named the crural ring, * Dissection of tlie crural sLeath (Illustrations of Dissections). A. Fascia lata reflected, b.

ANTERIOR HALF OF THE PERINiEAL SPACE. In the anterior part of the perinteal space are lodged the crura of Urethral the penis, and the tube of the urethra as it courses from the interior of the pelvis to the surface of the body. Placed about midway and^ge'iierai between the bones, the urethra is supported by the triangular ligament of the perinjeum, and by its union with the penis. ^' Muscles are collected around the urethra to aid in the expulsion of the contents of that tube : some of these are superficial to, and some within the triangular ligament. The vessels and nerve lie along the outer side, as in the posterior half, and send inwards offsets. Dissection (fig. 130). To raise the skin from the anterior part of incisions to the perinroum, a transverse cut is to be made at the back of the g|\^ : scrotum, and is to be continued for a short distance (two inches) on each thigh. A second incision along the middle line will allow the flaps of skin to be reflected outwards. After the removal of the Blow up skin the subcutaneous fat (superficial fascia) which covers the fesdl^and front of the perinfeal space, is to be blown up by means of a pipe reflect it. introduced beneath it posteriorly. Each side is to be inflated to demonstrate a partition along the middle line, and a septum between the perinatal space and the tliigh which prevents the air passing to the limb. The student is next to cut through the superficial fascia on the left side from the scrotum to the ischio-rectal fossa; and after ^reflecting it, and removing loose fatty tissue, its line of attachment to the bones externally, and to the triangular ligament posteriorly, will be brought into view. The septum along the middle line should be also defined. To demonstrate more completely the attachment of this subcutaneous layer to the pubic arch between the pcrinasal thigh anV ■space and the thigh, it will be necessary to take away fi-om the left l^^'^^;^^ limb the fat on the fascia lata, external to the line of the bone. In the fat of the thigh on the right side the student should seek On right the inferior pudendal nerve, wliich pierces the fascia lata one inch inferior' anterior to the tuber ischii, and about the same distance from the 1^'^^^^^^'^'^^ margin of the pubic arch ; and should trace its junction in the fat with the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. Afterwards the nerve is to be followed forwards to where it enters beneath the superficial fascia in the middle line.

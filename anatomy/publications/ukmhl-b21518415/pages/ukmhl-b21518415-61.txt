Termination of the nasal nerve (fig. 9). After the nerve becomes and in tiie cutaneous on the side of the nose, as seen in the dissection of the facial nerve (p. 36), it descends beneath the compressor naris umscle, and ends in the integuments of the wing and tip of the nose. The OPHTHALMIC Or LENTICULAR GANGLION of the Sympathetic Lenticular nerve (fig. 11, ^) is a small round body, of the size of a pin's head, S^''^^'*"'- and of a slight red colour. It is placed at the back of the orbit Situation, between the optic nerve and the external rectus, and commonly on the outer side of, and close to the ophthalmic artery. By its pos- Connee- terior part the ganglion has branches of communication with other nerves (its roots) ; and from the anterior part proceed the ciliary nerves to the eyeball. The ganglion communicates with sensory, motory, and sympathetic nerves. The offsets of communication are three in number. One, the long Three roots: root ("), is the branch of the nasal nerve before noticed, which joins long, the superior angle. A second branch of considerable thickness (short root passes from the inferior angle to join the branch of short, the third nerve that supplies the inferior oblique muscle. And the tliii'd root is derived from the sympathetic (tlie cavernous plexus), and sjm- either in imion with the long root, or as a distinct branch to the P'^thetic. posterior border of the ganglion. Branches. The short ciliary nerves (fig. 11) are ten or twelve in p^^,''p[g, number, and are collected into two bundles, which leave the upper eyeball, and lower angles of the front of the ganglion. In the upper bundle are four or five, and in the lower, six or seven nerves. As they extend along the optic nerve to the eyeball they occupy the outer and under parts, and communicate with the long ciliary branches of the nasal nerve. The OPHTHALMIC ARTERY, a branch of the internal carotid, is Ophthalmic transmitted into the orbit through the optic foramen. At first the vessel is outside the optic nerve, but it then courses inwards, over or under the nerve, to the inner angle of the orbit, where it ends iatheorhit. in a nasal branch (external) on the side of the nose (fig. 17, "), and anastomoses with the' angular and nasal branches of the facial. The branches of the artery are numerous, though inconsiderable Branches, in size, and may be arranged in three sets :â€”one arising outside the optic nerve, another above it, and a third set on the inner side. The lachnjmal artery accompanies the nen'-e of the same name Lachrjnnai to the upper eyehd, where it ends by supplying that part, and ^''^ anastomosing with the palpebral arches. It supplies branches, like the nerve, to the lachrymal gland and the conjunctiva ; and it to gland: anastomoses with the middle meningeal by an offset through the sphenoidal fissure. At the front of the orbit it sends a small branch with each of offset.^.

The upper part of the abdominal cavity is divided into Abdominal regions by lines extended between certain points of the parietes. '^'^^"'^ If two circular lines are carried round the body, so that one shall maiked out be opposite the cartilage of the ninth rib, and the other on a level regwia- •with the most prominent point of the crest of the hip bone, the ca^'^ty will be divided into three circles or zones, upper, middle, and lower. Each of these circles has been fiu-ther subdivided into three by a Three lateral line, on each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the centre sije'^^^^ of Poupart's ligament. The piece marked oft", on each side, from the three circles by the vertical line is named respectively, from above downwards, hypochondriac, lumbar, and iliac ; whilst the central part of each circle is designated fi-om above down, epigas- and three trie, umbilical, and hypogastric. central.

The alimentary tube presents differences in form, and is divided General into stomach, small intestine, and large intestine ; and the two last a\'hnentary are further subdivided, as it will afterwards appear. The several tube: viscera have the following general position :—The small intestine position is much coiled, and occupies the gi-eater part of the cavity ; whilst p^rts^^'"^^ the great intestine arches around it. Both are fixed in position by pieces of the serous lining. Above the arch of the great intestine are situate tlie stomach, the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas ; and of and below it, is the convoluted small gut. Behind the large intes- kidney, tine, on each side, is the kidney with its excretory tube. Superficial vieio of the contents. On first opening the abdomen Parts of the following viscera appear:—On the right side is the liver, which witiiout'''^^'^ is partly concealed by the ribs. On the left side a piece of the jliyj^'^^*^*^" stomach is visible ; but this A'iscus lies for the most part beneath the ribs and the liver. Descending from the stomach is a fold of peritoneum (the large omentum), which reaches to the pelvis, and conceals the small intestine : in some bodies the omentum is raised into the left hypochondriac region, and leaves the intestine uncovered. If the bladder is distended, a small part of it may come into view just above the pelvis, but commonly it is not seen. Before the natural position of the viscera is disturbed, their Connections situation in the different regions of the abdomen, and their connec- to besoeu. tions with surrounding parts should be examined.

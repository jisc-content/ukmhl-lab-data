617 SCARPA'S TEMGULAE SPACE. ral vessels are to be followed downwards as far as the sartorius muscle. On the outer side of the vessels clean the divisions of the seek nerves, anterior crural nerve, together with the branches of an artery (pro- funda) which are buried in the fat. In removing the fat from be- take away neath the femoral artery, the student is to look for one or two small nerv'es to the pectineus muscle. This intermuscular space (fig. 193) contains the tnmks of the blood- couteuts, vessels of the thigh, and the anterior crural nerve, with lymphatics Fig. 193.* and fat. It measures commonly three inches from above down ; but extent,, the length varies with the breadth of the sartorius, and the height at which this muscle crosses inwards. * Dissection of Scarpa's triangidar space (Illustrations of Dissections).

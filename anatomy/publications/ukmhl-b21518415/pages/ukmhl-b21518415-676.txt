DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 660 On the front it is strengthened by a Avicle layer of longitudinal fibres (fig ''02 a, h, c). The central portion,â€”the iho-femoraL liaament (a), is fixed above by a narrow piece to the lower anterior iliac spinous process, and below wliere it widens, into the anterior intertrochanteric line. By its strength it can arrest extension of the joint; and the femur being fixed, it will prop the pelvis.

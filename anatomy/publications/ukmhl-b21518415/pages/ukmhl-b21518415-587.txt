571 ANATOMY OF VESICULA SEMINALIS. Bloodvessels. The arteries are rather small, and are furnished by Arteries, the inferior vesical and middle lucmorrhoidal (p. 503). The veins form a plexus around the gland, which communicates in fi-ont with Veins form the dorsal vein of the penis, and behind with the venous plexus at the base of the bladder. In old men this vascular intercommuni- cation gives rise to considerable haemorrhage in the operation of lithotomy. The nerves are supplied by the hyjjogastric plexus. The lympluttics Nerves, of this body and of tlie vesicula3 seminales are received into the Lyi"i>iiiitius. glands placed along the internal iliac artery. Vesicul^ Seminales (fig. 176, e). These vesicles are two mem- Seminal branous sacs, which secrete a fluid to mix with the semen. They ■ Fig. 176.* are placed on the under part of the bladder behind the prostate, detinition, and diverge from one another so as to limit laterally a triangular situation, space in that situation : their form and connectiojis have been already described (p. 554), Though sacculated and bulged behind, saocuiated. the vesicula becomes straight and nan-owed in front (duct d) • and at the base of the prostate it blends with the vas deferens to form the common seminal or ejaculatory duct (g). The vesicula seminalis consists, like the epididymis, of a tube Formed of ;i bent into a zigzag form, so as to produce lateral sacs or pouches, ^'^^^'^^ ^^^^ • * View of the under part of the bladder with the vesiculie seminales and vasa deferentia (slightly altered from HalJer). a.

700 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Anterior ligament, tendon of the exten- sor. •Open tlie Jinee joint nerves to the interior of the articulation ; and the tendon of the pophteus pierces it. The anterior licjament (hgamentum patella)) (fig. 215, "), part of the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscle of the knee (p. 626), is two inches long. Superiorly it is attached to the lower part of the patella, and to the depression on the inner surface of the apex ; and inferiorly it is inserted into the tubercle of the head of the tibia, and into an inch of the bone below it. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers it; and a bursa intervenes between it and the toj) of the tubercle of the tibia. Dissection (fig. 210). To see the reflections of the S3mo\aal mem- brane raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an uicision ■and dissect crucial liga- ments. Syno\nal membrane on each side, above the patella. When the anterior part of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the intercondyloid fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is a similar fold (alar ligament) over some fat. The limb may be laid flat on the table, and some of the posterior ligament may be removed, to show the pouches of the synovial membrane which project behind over the condyles of the femur - but the hmb IS to be replaced in the former position before the l^arts are learnt. The synovial membrane (fig. 216) lines the interior of the capsule and IS continued to the articular ends of the bones. It invests the mterarticular cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and .ZJh'' '^P^V/i^^ W-joint cut across, and the patella tlu-oxvn i\omx to show the named folds of the synovial sac. a.

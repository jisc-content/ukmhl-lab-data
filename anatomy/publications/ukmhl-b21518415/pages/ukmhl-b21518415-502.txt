To the siu'f aces of the stomach some oifsets are given ; and others descend between the layers of the omentum. It furnishes the following named branches to the stomach, and the pancreas and duodenum ;— Small inferior pyloric branches end in the small extremity of the stomach. The 2^<^ncreafico-dno(hnal branch (/) (superior) arises opposite the duodenum, and runs between the intestine and the pancreas ; it anastomoses below with the pancreatico-duodonal branch (inferior) of the superior mesenteric (fig. 144, />).

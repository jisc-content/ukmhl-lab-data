Fiff. 94. and the gi-eater number of whose fibres are transverse, lias a corre- sponding attachment on the dorsal aspect of the same bones. Of the lateral ligaments the external {!>:) is the best marked, and extends between the os trapezium and the scaphoid bone ; the internal ligament (I) reaches between the cuneiform and unciform bones. Dissection. After the division of the lateral and posterior ligaments, Dissection, the one row of bones may be separated far enough fi-om the other, to allow a sight of the articular surfaces. Articular surfaces. The first row of carpal bones (except pisiform) forms internally an arch with the scaphoid (a), semilunar (rZ) and cuneiform bone (c), whose hollow is turned towards the second ; and externally a prominence with the scaphoid (a), which is received into a conca^^ty in the other row. In the second row the OS magnum (</) and os uncif orme (Ji) present a con- dyloid projection, which is received into the arch before mentioned ; but the two outer bones (trapezium and trapezoid, e and/) are much below the level of the others, and form a slight hollow for the reception of the outer part of the sca- phoid bone. One synovial memhrane sen'^es for the articulation of all the ^carpal bones, ex- cept the pisiform with the cuneiform. Lining the joint between the two rows of the carpus, the membrane sends upwards and downwards prolongations be- tween the individual bones. The offsets upwards are two, and they sometimes join the synovial membrane of the wrist joint; but the offsets in the opposite direction are three, and may be continued to all, or only to some of the articulations between the four inner metacarpal with their carpal bones. Movements. The transverse carpal joint is partly condyloid, but only forward and backward motion is permitted. A\\ lateral and circumductory movement is arrested, if the rows are closely applied together, by the scaphoid striking against the os magnum on the one side, and the cuneiform against the unciform on the other.

TEICEPS EXTENSOE OF KNEE. 625 The TENSOR VAGINiE FEMORIS (fig. 19G, ^) OCClipies the upper third Tensor of the thigh, and is the smallest and most external of the outer set femm^ of muscles. It takes origin from the front of the crest of the hip ai-ises fron. bone at the outer aspect; fi-om the anterior upper iliac spine, and 1'*^^^^^"' from part of the notch between this and the inferior spine as far as the attachment of the sartorius. Its fibres form a fleshy belly iibout two inches wide, and are inserted into the fascia lata about eiuis in three inches beloAV, and rather in fi'ont of the line of the great ^"^^^'^ trochanter of the femur. At its origin the muscle is situate between the sartorius and the P^-ts gluteus mcdius. Beneath it are the ascending offsets of the external circumflex artery ; and a branch of the superior gluteal nerve •enters its under surface. A sti'ong sheath of fascia surrounds the muscle. A ction. Supposing the limb moveable the muscle abducts the Use ou thigh, making tense at the same time the fascia lata ; and finally ""'' it will help in rotating inwards the femur. When the limb is fixed it will support the pelvis, and assist in pelvis, ibalancing the same on the femur in walking. Dissection. After the tensor has been learnt, the slip of fascia Cut tiirougU •extending fi-om it to the knee may be cut through ; and when it is muscle, detached from the muscles around, the head of the rectus may be followed upwards to the pelvis. The TRiCErs extensor of the knee (fig. 195) consists of three fleshy Muscle on parts or heads, outer (vastus externus), inner (vastus internus), and tidl^h."^ middle (rectus), which are united below in a common tendon. The RECTUS FEMORIS gives rise to a fleshy prominence on the Rectus lias front of the thigh (fig. 195, ''). At its origin fi-om the pelvis the '^'^ muscle consists of two tendinous pieces :—one arises from the origin at tiw ^anterior inferior iliac spinous process ; the other (to be afterwards i^*^^""' seen) is fixed into a depression on the back of the hip bone, close 'louWe, ^ibove the acetabulum. The fleshy fibres terminate inferiorly in insertion another tendon, which joins the aponeurotic parts of the other two JJiou tendon, muscles in the common tendon. The rectus is larger at the middle than at the ends; and its fibres Tiie muscle are directed from the centre to the sides, as in a quill, giving rise lona "ami to that condition called penniform. It is subcutaneous, except above ^^J.'y^^'^'"'' where it is overlaid by the sartorius. It conceals branches of the above, external circumflex artery and anterior crural nerve, and rests on the vasti. The upper tendon of the rectus reaches farthest on the anterior surface where the sartorius touches, whilst the lower tendon is most extensive on the posterior aspect, or towards the subjacent vasti. Dissection. To see the remaining muscles, cut across the rectus Cut the near the lower end, and raise it without injuring the branches of ^'"^ vessels and nerves beneath. The muscular mass on the front of the femur is to be divided into two, above, along the situation of "^JJ^^^^^l^^^^f« some descending vessels and nerves : the part external to the vessels cxterlms' is the vastus externus, and the larger mass, internal to them, is ^"J"^""' vastus internus. s s

Some of the finest twigs end in tufts of short, slightly curled and dilated vessels—the helicine arteries of Miiller (fig. 182, e), which project into the inter- heiicine trabecular spaces, and are imbedded in the thin coat of the veins (/) • with the extremities of these twisted vascular bodies fine fibrous processes are connected. The helicine arteries exist in greatest number at the posterior part of each corpus cavernosum. The veins fill the interstices of the areolar structure, and anas- Veins are tomose freely together to form venous plexuses ; and into them S^piex-* the terminal branches of the arteries pour their contents. By means uses: Fig. 182.* of the apertures in the septum the veins of opposite sides commu- nicate freely. The erectile condition of the corpus cavernosum is produced by the distension of the plexuses. The chief veins of the corpus cavernosum escape at the crus penis ending of with the artery, and join the pudic vein ; but others issue along the upper and under aspects, to end in the dorsal vein and the prostatic plexus. Corpus spongiosum urethrce (fig. 177). This constituent part of the Spongy penis surrounds the urethra, but not equally on all sides ; for at the p"nis; the bulb only a thin stratum is above the canal, whilst at the glans penis (fig. 179,1) it is placed chiefly above the urethral tube. Pos- teriorly an offset of the corpus spongiosum is continued beyond the bulb around the urethra. Structure. The tissue of the corpus spongiosum is similar to that its structure of the corpus cavernosum : thus it consists of a fibrous tunic en- nous^'^^^'^' closing a trabecular structure and bloodvessels. The fibrous covering is less dense and strong than in the corpora The fibrous cavernosa, and consists only of circular fibres. A septal piece (fig.

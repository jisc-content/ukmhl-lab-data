T T 2 GLUTEAL VESSELS AND NERVE. G43 the outer surface of the hip bone between tiie crest and the supe- ^\^^cs from rior cur\'-ed line, except behind where there is a surface of bone free from muscular fibres ; and many superficial fibres come from the strong fascia covering the anterior part of the muscle. The fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into an impression and inserted across the outer surface of the great trochanter, extending fi-om the i"*^"^ tra- tip behind to the root in fi-ont. chduttr. The superficial surface is concealed in part by the gluteus raaxi- Connec- mus ; and the deep is in contact with the gluteus minimus, and the gluteal vessels and nerve. The anterior border lies over the gluteus minimus, and is in contact with the tensor of the fascia lata. The postei-ior is contiguous to the pyriformis, only the gluteal vessels intervening. A small bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion and tlie trochanter. Action. The whole muscle abducts the hanging femur; and the Use with anterior fibres rotate in the limb. In walking it is combined with hanging, the adductors in moving forwards the femur. Both limbs resting on the ground the muscles assist in fixing the botli limbs pelvis. In standing on one leg this gluteus will aid in balancing ^^^'^^ \ the pehns on the top of the femur. one"eg.^ °" Dissection. When the gluteus medius is detached from the pehas, Detach and partly separated from the gluteus minimus beneath, the gluteal [{lus^o see" vessels and nerve will come into view. The two chief branches gluteal ves- of the arteiy,—one being near the iliac crest, and the other lower ^^^^ down,—are to be traced through the fleshy fibres as the reflection of the gluteus is proceeded with ; and the main part of tlie nerve and nerve, is to be followed at the same time to the tensor vaginaB femoris muscle. The branches of the artery and nerve to the gluteus medius will be cut in removing that muscle. The gluteal artery (fig. 198, a) is the largest branch of the inter- Gluteal nal iliac (p. 561), and issues fi-om the pelvis above the pyriformis muscle. On the dorsum of the hip bone it ends in offsets which divided into supply the gluteal muscles and the bone. Its named branches are ^ ' superficial and deep :— The superficial branch supplies offsets to the integuments, and Superficial some deeper twigs over the sacrum ; it ends in the gluteus maxi- ^^'^"^ naus, which it penetrates on the under surface. The deep branch (fig. 199, «) is the continuation of the artery, Deep and subdivides into two pieces which run lietween the two smaller o-lutei. One (b) (superior) courses along the origin of the gluteus n^iinimus (supplying mostly the medius) to the front of the iliac crest, where it anastomoses with the ascending branch of the exter- this has an ujipcr nal circumflex artery. The other portion (c) (inferior) is directed ^^^ ^^ ^ lowcr forwards over the middle of the smallest gluteal muscle, with the piece, nerve, towards the anterior lower ihac spine where it enters the tensor of the fascia lata, and communicates with the external cir- cumflex branch (p. 628) : many offsets are furnished to the gluteus minimus, and some pierce that muscle to supply the hip joint.

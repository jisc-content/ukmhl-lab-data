ELEVATORS OF rilARYXX. 125. muscles, and wants the usual conical form. Its or'ujin is extensive, and is connected successively, from above down, with the inner surface origin iu of the internal pterygoid plate (the lower third or less), with the pterygo-maxillary ligament, with the jiosterior part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, and with the mucous membrane of the mouth and the side of the tongue. Tlie lieshy fibres pass backwards, and insertion are inserted on the aponeui-osis of the pharynx, as well as into the tiic o'tiiVrs. raphe along the middle line. The parts in contact externally with this nuiscle are, tlie deep Contiguous vessels and nerves of the neck ; antl internally it is lined by the aponeurosis and the mucous membrane. The upper border consists of arched fibres which are dii'ected backwards from the pterygoid plate ; and above it the levator palati nuiscle F is seen. The lower border is overlaid by the middle constrictor muscle. The attachment to the pterygo-maxillary ligament corresponds with the origin of the buccinator muscle i. Action of constrictors. The muscles of both sides contracting will Useofcoa- diminish tlie size of the pharynx ; and as the anterior attachments '^''''i'^t'O'''^' of the lower muscles are nearer together than those of the upper, the tube will be contracted more behind the larynx than near the head. In swallowing the morsel is seized first by the middle constrictor, in swallow- and is delivered over to the inferior, by which it is conveyed to the oesophagus : both muscles act involuntarily. By the contraction of the upper muscle the space above the mouth will be narrowed, so that the soft palate being raised, the upper poi-tion of the pharyn- geal space can be shut oft' from the lower. Dissection (fig. 29). Open the pharynx by an incision along its Dissection.. middle, and, after removing the tow from the interior, keep it open with hooks : a better view of the cavity will be obtained by partly dividing the occipital attachment on each side. The mucous mem- brane is to be carefully removed below the dilated extremity of the Eustachian tube on the right side, for the purpose of finding some pale muscular fibres, salpingo-pharyngeus c, which descend from it. The ELEN ATORS of the pharynx are two in number on each side,â€”an Elevators of external (stylo-pharyngeus), and an internal (salpingo-pharyngeus). The stijlo-pliarijmjeus (external elevator) may be read again with stylo-piia- the phary-nx. Its description is given in p. 102. ryugeus. Salpingo-pharyngeus^ c (internal elevator).

This thin nuiscle elevates the upper and lateral part of Use. the pharj-nx above the spot where the large external elevator enters the wall;. but it is probably used chiefly in opening the Eustachian tube in swallowing. The interior of the pharynx (fig. 29) is wider from side to side interior of than from before back, and its greatest width is opposite the hyoid Pi^aiTux.

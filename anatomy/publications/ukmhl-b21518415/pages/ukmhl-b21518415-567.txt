HEFLECTIONS OF TERITONEUM. 551 between the rectum and the bladder. Anteriorly it extends shghtly into the interval between the vesiculfe seininales, and ends usually extent and about one inch and a half from the tip of the coccyx. The distance thi of the pouch fi-om the anus is commonly about four niches ; but •"^"'^s vary. it will vary mth the state of the bladder, for if this viscus is distended the peritoneum will be raised, and removed further from the end of the intestine. False ligaments of the bladder. Where the peritoneum is reflected False liga- fi'om the bladder to the pelvic wall, it gives rise to a wide piece of the bladder, membrane, which constitutes the false ligaments of that viscus, ^^'i^,— Fig. 172.* though without any subdi\asion of it into pieces. These are said to be five in number:—two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior ligament (one on each side) reaches fi-om the l)ack two poste- of the pelvis to the bladder, and contains the obliterated hypogastric artery, the ureter, and smaller vessels, and nerves. Between these is the hollow of the recto-vesical pouch. The lateral ligament, also one on each side, the widest, is reflected two lateral, fi-om the side of the bladder to the iliac-fossa and the wall of the pelvis. Along its line of attachment to the bladder is the obliterated liypogastric artery. The superior ligament is prolonged fi-om the top of the bladder '^JJI^^oiie. * Side view of the dissected male pelvis, a. Urinary bladder. I. Prostate. c. ]\Iembranous part of the urethra, d.

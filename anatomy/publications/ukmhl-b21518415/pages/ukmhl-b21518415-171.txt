155' EXTEENAL LARYNGEAL MUSCLES. terior aspect of the larynx : to denude them it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane coverinj? it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the crico-aryteenoideus posticus muscle ; and above it, on the posterior part of the arytajnoid cartilages, the arytajnoid muscle will appear. The CRICO-THYROIDEUS MUSCLE (fig. 39, ^) is triangular in form, CHco-thy- and is separated by an interval from the one on the opposite side. It arises from the front and the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage ; Origin. Fig. 39.* Fig. 40.t and its fibres ascend to be inserted into the lower cornu, and the insertion, lower border of the thyroid cartilage as far forwards as a quarter of an inch from the middle line; also, for a short distance (a line), into the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the crico-th}Toid membrane, and is concealed by the stemo-thyroid muscle. Action. It approaches the thyroid to the cricoid cartilage, making Use. longer the distance between the thyroid and the aryta?noid cartilages, and tightens indirectly the vocal cords. The CRICO-ARYTiENOlDEUS POSTICUS MUSCLE (fig. 40, lies on the Crico-aryta-- posterior part of the cricoid cartilage. Its origin is fi-om the depres- polit[i"is sion on the side of the vertical ridge at the back of that cartilage, is on back of cricoiil From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, and are inserted cartilage, into a projection at the outer part of the base of tlie arytfenoid cartilage. * Front view of the larynx.

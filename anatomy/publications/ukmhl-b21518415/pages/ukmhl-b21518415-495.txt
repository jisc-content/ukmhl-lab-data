LOWER MESENTERIC VESSELS. The mesenteric lymphatic glands are numerous between the hiyers Mesenteric of the mesentery. An upper group lies by the side of the artery, '^'^^^'^'^ and contains the h^rgest ghinds ; and a lower group, near the in- testine, is lodged in the intervascular spaces. The chyliferous lyniphaties vessels of the small intestine, and the absorbents of the part of the large intestine supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, pass through the mesenteric glands in their cotn-se to the thoracic duct. Fig. 142.* Along the side of the ascending and the transverse colon are a M.^so-colu- few other small lymphatic glands meso-colic, which receive some si-ii'l*- absorbents of the large intestine. Dissection (fig. 142). By drawing the small intestine over to the '^f'^^^f^pj!"" right side, the dissector will observe the inferior mesenteric artery mesenterie on the fi-ont of the aorta a little above the Ijifurcation. The peri- toneum should be removed fi-om it, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intestine: a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be dissected afterwards. * The lower mesenteric artery, and the aorta, seen hy turning aside tlie upper mesenteric artery and the small intestine (Tiedemann). a.

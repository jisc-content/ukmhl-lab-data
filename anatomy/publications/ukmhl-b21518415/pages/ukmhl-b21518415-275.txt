DORSAL SCAPULAR MUSCLES. 259 beneath the deltoid muscle in which it ends. Many and large branches ends in lenter the deltoid, and terminate in it ; one or two filaments pierce '^'^^^^^ • .the fibres and become cutaneous. Branches. In the axilla it gives an articular filament to the under branches: part of the shoulder-joint. Behind the humerus it furnishes an offset f^i'ti'^i'ii"", ■ to the tei'es minor (■^), which has a reddish gangliform swelling on *° it. And at the edge of the deltoid it gives origin to the cutaneous cutaneous. nerve (') before noticed. The INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE (fig. 74, ^) occupies the infraspinal part infraspiua- of the scapula, and extends to the head of the humerus. The muscle frmn"^^** larises from the infraspinal fossa, except at tluee spots, viz. the neck, fossa of that and the lower angle and inferior border where the teres nuiscles "^"^^^' are attached ; it arises also from the lower side of the spinous pro- •<;ess, and fi-om the special fascia covering the surface. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the middle impression insertion, on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and joins the tendons of fthe supraspinatus and teres minor. A part of the muscle is subcutaneous, and the fibres arising fi'om partly the spine of the scapula overlay the tendon : the upper portion is |ieito\d! concealed by the deltoid ; and the lower end, by the latissimus dorsi. The lower border is parallel to the teres minor, with which other eon- it is sometimes united. The muscle lies on the scapula and the I'ections. humero-scapular articulation, but between it and the joint is a small bursa. Action. With the humerus hanging it acts as a rotator outwards ; Use. and when the bone is raised it will move the same backwards in concert with the hinder part of the deltoid. The TERES MINOR (fig. 74, ^) is a narrow fleshy slip, which is often ^^^^f ^"'^"^j united inseparably with the precedhig muscle, along whose lower tue scapula, border it lies. It arises on the dorsum of the scapula from a special surface along the upper two thirds of the inferior costa of the bone, and from the investing fascia ; and it is inserted by a tendon into Insertion, the lowest of the three marks on the great tuberosity of the humerus, as well as by fleshy fibres into the humerus below that spot—about an inch together. This muscle is partly covered by the deltoid ; it rests on the long Parts _^ liead of the triceps and the shoulder joint. Underneath it the dorsal '"^'"^"^ '' branch of the subscapular artery turns. Action. The arm hanging the muscle rotates it out and moves it Use on arm, back ; the arm being raised the teres depresses the humerus. In climbing it supports the joint like the preceding scapular on joint, muscles. The TERES MAJOR nmscle (fig. 74, ^) is extended from the inferior Teres major, angle of the scapula to the humerus. Its origin is from the rough Origin, ■surface on the dorsum of the bone at the inferior angle ; fi-om the inferior costa as far forwards as an inch from the long head of the triceps ; and fi-om the fascia covering the teres minor. The fibres end in a tendon which is inserted partly into, and partly behind the insertion, inner edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus. This muscle assists in forming the posterior fold of the axilla; Minoent 8 2

Muscular or anastomotic Iranches (/) to the back of the thigh Anastomotic (three or four in number) pass tln-ough the adductor magnus at branches, some distance fi-om the linea aspera, and end in a chain of anasto- moses in the ham-strings.

To bring into view the remaining muscles, viz., ad- Cut throng ductor magnus, obturator externus, and the psoas and iliacus inser- brevis. tion, the adductor bre^•is is to be cut through near the pelvis, and to be thrown down. Then the investing layer of fascia and areolar tissue is to be removed fi-om each muscle. After the adductor magnus has been leanit, it will be needful to detach a few of the upper fibres to examine the obturator externus. The ADDUCTOR MAGNUS (fig. 12G, ^) is narrow at the pelvis, and Adductor wide at the femur. It is triangular in form, with its base directed > upwards, one side being attached to the femm-, and the other free at the inner part of the thigh. The muscle arises along the pubic arch of the innominate bone origin is . iiiirrow * outside the other adductors, rcaclaing from the symphj^sis to the ' lower part of the ischial tuberosity. The anterior fibres diverge <ibres from their origin, being horizontal above but more oblique below, their^user- and are inserted (fi-om above down) into the line fi-om the great ^ion, trochanter to the linea aspera: into the linea aspera; and into the ^^'"e « ci 1- TIC honzontal, Ime leadmg from that crest of bone to the mner condyle for about ^^jg^j, an inch. The posterior fibres fi-om the ischial tuberosity are vertical vertical, in direction, and end at the lower third of the thigh in a tendon, which is inserted into the inner condyle of the femur, and is con- nected by a fibrous expansion to the inner condyloid ridge. The muscle consists of two parts, which differ in their characters. i'"<l f^"" two T^&rts The anterior one, thin and fleshy, fomis a septum between the other adductors and the muscles on the back of the thigh ; but the pos- terior piece, partly fleshy and partly tendinous, constitutes the inner thick margin of the muscle. On the anterior surface are the other two adductors and the pectineus, with the obturator nerve and the yf°gy®f^*!gg ^ profimda arteiy. The posterior surface touches the ham-string muscles and the great sciatic nerve. In contact with the upper border are the obturator externus and the quadratus femoris, with and borders: the internal circumflex vessels ; and along tlie inner border lie the gracilis and the sartorius. At its attachment to the femur the muscle is closely united with the other adductors, particularly the adductor longus, and is there pierced by apertures for the passage of the femoral and perforating arteries. Action. This muscle is used as an adductor, but chiefly as a pro- u&e^on

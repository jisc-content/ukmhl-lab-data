SCALEXI AlCSCLES. €7 ■scalenus. If it is tliouglit necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied. Clean the cervical plexus, and seek its nuiscular branches, the of cervical small twigs to join the descendens noni, and the roots of the ^'^'^^^^ phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the middle scalenus muscle be defined, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. The SCALENI muscles are usually described as three in number. Number of scivlciii and are named £rom their relative position, anterior, middle, and muscles, posterior ; they extend fi-om the first two ribs to tlie transverse processes of the cervical vertebrav The SCALENUS ANTicus (fig. IG, ^) extends from the first rib to Scalenus the lower cervical vertebrae, and is somewhat conical in shape. It is attached by its apex to the inner border and the upper surface origin; of the first rib, so as to surround the rough surface or pi-ojection 'on this aspect of the bone ; and by its base it is inserted into the insertion; anterior transverse processes of four of the cervical vertebr{e, viz. sixth, fifth, fourth, and third (fig. 45, ^'). More deeply seated below than above, the muscle is concealed connections, by the clavicle and the subclavius, and by the clavicular part of the sterno-mastoid : the phrenic nerve lies along its cutajieous with vessels,, ^ surface, and the subclavian vein crosses over it near the rib.^ Along^^*^ .•^^'^^^^^^^ the inner border is the internal jugular vein. Beneath the scalenus axil^ nerves, fcu^ are the pleura, the subclavian artery, and the nerves of the brachial 'Uan'^'■ < plexus. The insertion into the vertebrte corresponds with the origin OTftC'k of the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Action. The anterior of these muscles raises strongly the first rib. Use. in consequence of its forward attachment. If the rib is fixed, it bends forwards the lower part of the neck. The SCALENUS MEDIUS MUSCLE (fig. 16, ") is larger than the Scalenus anterior, and extends farthest of all on the vertebroe. Inferiorly it is attached to a groove on the upper surface of the first rib, Origin; extending obliquely forwards fi-om the tubercle^ to the outer border for one inch and a half. The muscle ascends beliind the spinal nerves, and is inserted into the tips of the posterior transverse insertion, processes of all the cervical vertebraa (fig. 45, ^^). In contact with the anterior surface are the subclavian artery rarts in and the spinal nerves, together with the stemo-niastoid muscle ; witii IL whilst the posterior surface touches the posterior scalenus, and the deep lateral muscles of the back of the neck. The outer border is perforated by tlie nerves of the rhomboid and sen-atus muscles. Action. Usually it elevates the first rib. With the rib fixed, the Use. cervical part of the spine will be incHned laterally by one muscle. The SCALENUS POSTICUS (fig. 45, ^) is inconsiderable in size, and Si^aienns appears to be but part of the preceding. It is attached below by a slip, about lialf an inch wide, to the second rib, in front of the ser- ;„ent8. ratus posticus superior ; and it is inserted above with the scalenus medius into two or three of the lower cei-vical transverse processes. Action. It acts as an elevator of the second rib ; and its fibres Use. having the same direction as those of the medius, it will incline the neck~in the same way. F 2 •

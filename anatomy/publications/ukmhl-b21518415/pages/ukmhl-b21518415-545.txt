529 DIAPHRAGM AND ITS ACTION. alternate with like parts of the transversalis muscle ; but a slight intervals in interval separates the slips to the xiphoid cartilage and seventh rib, and a second space exists sometimes between the fibres fi-om the last rib and the arch over the quadratus hnnborum muscle. In it Apertures. are certain apertures for the transmission of parts from the thorax to the abdomen. The muscle is convex towards the chest, and concave to the Arch, abdomen. Its arch reaches higher on the right than the left side (p. 327), and is constantly varying during life in respiration. In forced expiration the muscle ascends, and reaches as high as the Height in upper border of the right fourth rib at the sternum, and the upper expiration edge of the fifth rib on the left side, close to the sternum. In forced inspiration it descends, and its slope would be represented and inspi- by a line drawn from the middle of the ensiform cartilage to the eleventh rib. Action. As the muscle moves up and down during respiration, it is Use in depressed by the contraction of the fleshy fibres which are attached ^'^spiration. to the ribs and spine, and is raised during their relaxation. When the diaphragm descends it changes its shape. The central Form in tendon, which moves but slightly, remains the highest part of the i"Â«i"''^t'0" arch, whilst the sides which contract freely are sloped from the tendon to the wall of the thorax. During the ascent the midriflE retains nearly the same form as in a state of rest, for the tendon is and in expinitioii, * Under surface of the diaphragm, a. Diaphragm, b. Psoas magnus. c.

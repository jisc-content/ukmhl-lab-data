VILLI OF SMALL INTESTINES. 497 They begin iu the duodenum, about one or two inches beyond extent on the pylorus, and are continued in regular succession to the middle ^|uV"**^^" of the jejunum ; but beyond that point they become smaller and more distant from one another, and finally disappear about the middle of the ileum, having previously become irregular and rudi- mentary. The folds are largest and most uniform beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile duct. The (iperture of the common bile and pancreat/c ducts (fig. 148, e) Opening of is a narrow orifice, from three to four inches fi'om the pylorus, and '^^^^' is situate in a small prominence of the mucous membrane, at the where inner and posterior part of the duodenum (p. 483). A probe passed into the bile duct will show the oblique course (half an inch) under the mucous coat. Sometimes the pancreatic duct opens by a distinct sometimes â€¢ f. double. onnce.

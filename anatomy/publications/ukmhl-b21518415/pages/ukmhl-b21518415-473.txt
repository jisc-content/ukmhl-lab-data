It situation, is oval in form, the extremities of the oval being directed upwards fo"" and downwards, and measures about half an inch; the fascia at its outer and lower parts is stronger than at the opposite sides. Arching above and on the inner side of the aperture, is the lower "Pperand border of the transversalis muscle, D, which is fleshy in the outer, but tendinous in the inner half. Below, it is bounded by Poupart's ligament. On the inner side lie the epigastric vessels («). This opening in the fascia transversalis is the inlet to the inguinal canal, and tlu-ough it the cord, or the round ligament, passes into inner boundary: parts trans- mitted tlirough it. Fig. 138.* the wall of the abdomen. The external hernia enters the canal at the same spot. All the protruding parts receive as a covering the prolongation from the margin of the opening. The external aldovnnal ring (fig. 133, ^) is the outlet of the in- f,^iominai guinal canal, and through it the spermatic cord reaches the surface ring; of the body. This aperture is placed in the aponeurosis of the situation, external oblique muscle, near the crest of the pubes; and from the * Dissection for inguinal hernia (Ilhisti-ations of Dissections).

Some strong irregular bundles of fibres, the inferior interosseous inferior ligament, extend between the bones below the aperture for the ° anterior peroneal artery. It may be seen after the examination of the ankle joint by sawing longitudinally the lower ends of the leg bones. Movement. Very little movement is allowed in the tibio-peroneal Motion articulations, as the chief use of the fibula is to give security to the ° ' ankle joint and attachment to muscles of the leg. In the upper joint there is a slight gliding from before back. In in upper the lower articulation the ligaments permit some yielding of the iibula to the pressure of the astragalus, as when the weight of the articuia- body is thro%vn on the inner side of the foot ; but if the force is violent the lower fourth of that bone will be fi-actm-ed sooner than the ligaments. Articulation of the ankle (fig. 219). Like the knee, the ankle is a ginglymoid or hinge joint. In this joint the upper surface of joint. • Fis. 219.* the astragalus is received into an arch formed by the lower ends of the tibia and fibula ; and, the four ligaments belonging to this Idnd of articulation connect together the bones. Dissection. To make the dissection required for the ligaments of ^JfJ^^'"" the ankle joint, the muscles, and the fibrous tissue and vessels must ankle joint, be removed from the front and back of the articulation. For the purpose of defining tlie lateral ligaments, the limb must be placed first on one side and then on the other. The internal ligament is wide and strong, and lies beneath the tendon of the • Internal lateral ligament of the ankle (altered from Bourgery).—1. Posterior piece. 2. Middle piece. 3.

DISSECTION OF THE . rEEINiEUM. 424 SuixTticiai The suhcntmeous fatty layer or the svperfidal fascia of the anterior iaÂ«cia: i^^if of the pcrinKiuu is continuous with that of the adjoniing- regions ; and its depth, and the quantity of fat in it, Avill vary with the condition of the body. It resembles tbe con-esponding- stratum itstliickness of the groin and upper part of the thigh, in consisting of two vzirics different portions. Supei-nciai One, a subcutaneous fatty part, continuous with that of the rest '""^ of the body, which loses its fat towards the scrotum, and obtains there involuntary muscular fibres. The other deeper, but more membranous part, is of limited extent, deep part and is connected with the finn subjacent structures. Externally it is fixed to the pubic arch of the hip-bone, outside the line of the eras penis and its muscle, extending as low as the ischial tuberosity. Posteriorly the stratum bends down to join the triangular ligament of the urethra ; but in front it is unattached, and is continued to Forms a the scrotum and penis. By means of similar connections of the infront;^'^'^ membrane on both sides, a space is enclosed over the anterior half this divided of the perinaium. From its under surface a sej^tum dips down- by a septum, -wards in the middle line, and divides posteriorly the subjacent space into two ; but anteriorly this partition is less perfect, or may disappear. * Superficial dissection of the anterior half of the perinaeum (Illustrations of Dissections).

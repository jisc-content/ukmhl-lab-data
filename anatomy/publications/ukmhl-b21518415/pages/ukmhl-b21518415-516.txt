DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 600 a collection of follicles. Arteries. Lacteals. Compound glands, Brunner's; compo- sition : apertures of their ducts. The epithe- lium is columnar. which are round or oval in form, and are covered by the mncous membrane. Around each follicle is a ring of apertures of the crypts before described. The follicles have the same composition as the scattered " solitary glands." Fine arterial twigs (fig. 150, ^) ramify on the follicles, and send inwards capillary offsets which form a network in the interior, and Fig. 151.* 52. t converge to the centre. Lacteal vessels form plexuses around and beneath the follicle, but do not penetrate the wall. The Glands of Brunner (fig. 152, h) are small compound bodies, similar to the buccal and labial glands of the mouth, Avhich exist in the duodenum. For a few inches near the pylorus they are most numerous, and there they are visible without a lens, being nearly as large as hemp seed. The glands consist of lobules, with appertaining excretory tubes: and each ends on the surface of the mucous membrane by a duct (c), Avhose aperture is slightly larger than the mouths of the contiguous crypts of Licberkiihn ; they secrete mucus. Epithelium. The epithelial lin- ing of the mucous membrane of the small intestine is of the cohnnnar or cylindrical kind. On the villi it forms a distinct cover- ing of elongated pieces. It sinks into the crypts of Lieberkiihn, and into the ducts of the glands of Brunner, and gives them a lining. * A.

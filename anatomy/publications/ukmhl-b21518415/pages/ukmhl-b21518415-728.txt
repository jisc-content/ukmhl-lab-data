The inferior calcaneo-cuhoid liyament in the sole of the foot (hg. 222) is much the strongest, and is divided into a superficial and a deep part :— • ++ i l The superficial portion, ligammtum lonfjum 2)lantce ( ), is attacnea to the under surface of the os calcis from near the posterior to the Fi<». 222.* Fig. 223.+ superficial and deep baud. anterior tubercle; its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone ; but the most in- ternal are contmued over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle,. assisting to form its sheath, and are inserted into the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones.

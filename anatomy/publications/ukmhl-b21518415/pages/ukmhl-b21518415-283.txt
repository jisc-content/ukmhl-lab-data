MUSCLES OF THE ARM. 267: And to keep in place the vessels and nerves at the upper part of the limb, these should be tied together with string in their natural position to one another, and fastened to the coracoid process. Position. The limb is still to lie on the back, but the scapula is j^"*'^*'^" to be raised by means of a small block ; and the bladebone is to ' " be fixed in such a position as to render tense the muscles. The inner surface of the arm is to be placed towards the dissector. Dissection. The aponeurosis is to be reflected fi'om the front of Dissection the arm by an incision along the centre, like that through the integuments ; and it is to be removed on the outer side as far as the outer condyloid ridge of the humerus, but on the inner side rather farther back than the corresponding line, so as to lay bare part of the triceps muscle. In raising the fascia the knife nnist be an'i vessels,. can-ied in the direction of the fibres of the biceps muscle ; and to prevent the displacement of the brachial ai-tery and its nerves, fasten them here and there with stitches. In front of the elbow is a hollow containing the brachial vessels : elbow liollow the artery should be followed into it, to show its ending in the radial and ulnar tnmks. Muscles on the Front of the Arm. There are only three muscles on the fore part of the arm. The one along the centre of of the ana. the limb is the biceps ; and that along its inner side, reaching about half way down, is the coraco-brachialis. The brachialis anticus lies beneath the biceps. Some muscles of the forearm are connected to the inner and outer condyles of the humerus, and to the line above the outer condyle. The BICEPS MUSCLE (fig. 78, ^) forms the prominence obser\'able Biceps lias on the front of the arm. It is wider at the middle than at either loiig head end ; and the upper part consists of two tendinous pieces of dif- ferent lengths, which are attached to the scapula. The short head arises from the apex of the coracoid process in common with the coi*aco-brachialis muscle (fig. 73); and the long head is attached to the upper part of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, within the capsule of the shoulder joint (fig 89). Muscular fibres sprhig from each tendinous head, and blend about the middle of the arm in a fleshy belly, which is somewhat flattened from before back. In- insertion feriorly the biceps ends in a tendon, and is inserted into the tubercle of the radius. The muscle is superficial except at the extremities. At the upper fi^^'^^ cover- part it is concealed by the pectoralis major and deltoid nuiscles ; and at the lower end the tendon dips into the hollow in front of the elbow, having previously given an offset to the fascia of the arm. Beneath the biceps are the brachialis anticus nuiscle, the '?^"'^ beneath musculo-cutaneous nei-ve, and the upper part of the humerus. Its i,â€žicr border inner border is the guide to the brachial artery below the middle of 1.^^=^^'^;^^^.*? the humerus, but above that spot the coraco-brachialis muscle inter- venes between them. The connection of the long head of the biceps with the shoulder joint, and the insertion of the muscle into the radius, will be afterwards learnt.

83 POSITION OF VESSELS AND XERVES. After the loose piece of bone has been removed, and the sub- tako itawaj jacent parts freed from much fat, the pterygoid muscles will '""^ tho fat. appear,—the external (-) being directed outwards to the condyle of the jaw, and the internal which is parallel in direction to the masseter, being inclined to the angle of the jaw. In removing the fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin internal lateral ligament, which lies on the internal pterygoid muscle beneath the ramus. ^ivz'rpn Position of vessels. Crossing inwards over the external pterygoid position of muscle, is the internal maxillary artery, which distributes offsets ^'^^s'-'l*- Fig. 18.* upwards and downwards: sometimes the artery will be placed beneath the muscle. The veins with the artery are large and plexiform : and may be taken away. Position of mn-es. Most of the branches of the inferior maxillary Nervos. neiwe aj^pear in this dissection. Thus, issuing from beneath the lower border of tlic external pterygoid are the large dental and gustatory nerves, the latter being the more internal of the two ; and coming out behind the joint of the jaw is the auriculo-temporal nerve. Appearing between the upj^er border of the muscle and the cranium, arc tlie small masseteric and deep temporal nerves. The buccal branch of tlie nerve perforates the fibres of the same muscle near the inner attachment. Branches of the above-men- * Superficial view of the pterygoid region fQuain's "Arteries"). 1.

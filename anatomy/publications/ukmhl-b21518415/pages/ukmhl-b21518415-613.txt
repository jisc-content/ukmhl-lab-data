SACRO-SCIATIC LIGAMENTS. 597 extensible piece of cartilage interposed between tlieni. In some instances, and especially during pregnancy, there is a greater sometimes degree of motion perceptible. Two sacro-sciatic ligaments pass from the lateral part of the Sacro-seiatic sacrum and coccyx to the hinder border of the os innominatum, two l'' Fig. 1S7.* Fig. 188.t across the space between the bones at the back of the pelvis: they are named large and small. The large hgament (fig. 188, o) reaches from the back of the Large, hip bone, and the side of the sacrum and coccyx to the ischial tube- rosity. As this may have been cut in the examination of the gluteal region, no further notice is given here ; but if it remains entire, see Dissection of the Buttock for its description. The small ligament (fig. 188, li) is attached internally by a wide Small; piece to the border of the sacrum and coccyx, where it is united with the ongin of the preceding band. The fibres are directed attachments outwards, and are inserted by a narrowed part into the ischial spine of the hip bone. Its pelvic surface is covered by the coccygeus and connec- muscle ; and by the opposite surface it is in contact with the great sacro-sciatic ligament. Alwve it is the large sacro-sciatic foramen ; and below it is the small foramen of the same name, which is bounded by the two ligaments. By their position these ligaments convert into two foramina Apertures (sacro-sciatic), the large sacro-sciatic excavation in the dried bones: tiienu^^ the openings, and the parts they give passage to, are described with the Buttock. * This figure shows the irregular piece of cartilage (a) in the sacro-iliac corticulation. , . . 7 o n f Sacro-sciatic ligaments, a.

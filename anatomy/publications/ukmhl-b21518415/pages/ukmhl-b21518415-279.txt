Beneath the supraspinatus it furnishes a supraspinal branch for gives a the supply of the muscle, the bone, and the shoulder joint. hruid.^'^^^ The companion vein of the suprascapular artery joins the external vein, jugular vein. The suprascapular nerve Q) is a branch of the brachial plexus fj,"^',[|!^y'^^^' (p. 73). When it reaches the costa of the scapula, it enters the supra- spinal fossa beneath the posterior special ligament. In the fossa it supplies two branches to the supraspinatus; and is continued be- t>raiiches. neath a fibrous band to the infraspinatus muscle, in which it ends. The nerve gives some articular filaments to the shoulder joint, Articular, and other offsets to the scapula. The posterior scapular arteiij rims along the base of the scapula Posterior beneath the rhomboid muscles, furnishing offsets to them and the arte^f'^ surfaces of the bone. It is more fully noticed with the dissection of the Back. The dorsal branch of the suhscapidar artery (h) (p. 248) turns Dorsal below the inferior costa of the scapula, opposite the posterior of subscapular the two spaces between the teres muscles. Entering the infra- ai-tery. spinal fossa beneath the teres minor, it supj^lies that muscle and the infi"aspinatus, and communicates with the suprascapular artery. This vessel sends a branch along the dorsum of the scapula between the teres muscles, towards the inferior angle of the bone. Section III. THE FRONT OF THE ARM. Position. For the dissection of the superficial vessels and nerves Position on the fi-ont of the arm the hmb should lie flat on the table, with the front uppermost. Dissection. The skin is to be raised from the fore and hinder parts and inci- of the arm and elbow' joint. To reflect it, make one incision along gj-^^^ the centre of the limb as far as two inches below the elbow ; and at the termination, a second cut half roimd the forearm. Strip now the skin from the limb, as low as the transverse incision, so that the fat which contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves may be denuded. Between the skin and the prominence of the olecranon a bursa may be seen. The cutaneous veins (fig. 76) maybe sought first in .^''^^ = Ig-J^y^^g' they are very numerous below the bend of the elbow, as they issue from beneath the integument. One in the centre of the forearm is the median vein, wliich bifurcates rather below the elbow. External

It is concealed by the small intestine, which is directed more to the left than the right side. The rectum, or the termination of the large intestine, which is Hcctuui. contained in the pelvis, will be examined in the dissection of that ■cavity.

The upper surface, convex, is turned to the vault of the diaphragm, Sm-faces, -and is divided into two parts by the suspensory ligament ; the right portion, more prominent than the left, reaches to the level of "the fifth intercostal space. The under surface is in contact with ai"^i uiuicr. the stomach and the duodenum, with the ascending colon, and with the right kidney and suprarenal body ; attached to this surface is -a fold of the peritoneum (small omentum), containing the hepatic "v'essels.

The gall bladder projects beyond this edge. The ^^^^^ ^^^^^ postei'ior boi'der is thick, and is connected \o the diaphragm by rior. certain ligaments or pieces of the peritoneum ; it lies on the large vessels (aorta and cava) and on the pillars of the diaphragm. The liver changes its situation with the ascent and descent of rositionis the diaphragm in respiration ; for in inspiration it descends, and in diaphragiu, •expix-ation it regains its former level. In the upright and sitting Q^imiy""^ postures, too, this viscus descends lower than in the horizontal con- •dition of the body ; so that when the trunk is erect, the anterior -border may be felt underneath the edge of the ribs, but when the body is reclined it is withdrawn within the margin of the thorax.

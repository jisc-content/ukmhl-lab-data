44 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. the snperior rectus and levator palpebrfe muscles, and lies afterwards below the superior oblique ; in this part of its course it furnishes the following branches:— Branches. The branch to the lenticular ganglion f) is about half an incli Long root of long and very slender, and arises as soon as the nerve comes into SngSu' the^orbit: this is the long root of the lenticular ganglion. Long ciliary Long ciliary branches. As the nasal crosses the optic nerA-e, it branches. g,ipp]ies two or more ciliary branches (fig. 11) to the eyeball. Fig. n* Infra-trool-,- lear brancli. These lie on the iniier side of the optic, and join the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion. The ivfra-trochlear branch (-) arises as the nasal nerve is about to leave the cavity, and is directed forwards below the pulley of the superior oblique maiscle, to end in the upper eyelid, the con- junctiva, and the side of the nose. Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of Gommunication from the supra-troch- lear nerve. * Second view of the oriSit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:— a.

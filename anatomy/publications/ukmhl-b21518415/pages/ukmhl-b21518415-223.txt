INNER CEREBRAL CONVOLUTIONS. 207 The occipital lohule (-') is triangular in shape, with the base Occipital upwards, at the margin of the hemisphere. Measm-ing about an inch and a half in depth, it lies between the internal parieto-occi- pital fissure, PO, and the calcarine sulcus (Z). Sulci running fi-om apex to base divide it into four or five narrow convolutions. Internal perpendicular or paneto-occipital fissure (PO, fig. 62) inner; separates the two preceding lobules. Continuous with the external fissure of the same name, it opens below into the following. fissure. The calcarine sulcus Z, (Huxley) is directed across the back of caicarine the hemisphere below the level of the corpus callosum, and ends sulcus, in front at the gyrus fomicatus (''), whose hinder limit it marks.

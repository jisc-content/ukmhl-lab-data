Dissection. Dissection. The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal bones on each side are to be next dissected out by taking away the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. Before reading its description, the ends of the cut ligament may be placed in ap- position. The anterior anmilar ligament is a firm ligamentous band, which arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is attached externally to the front of the os scaphoides, and to the fore and inner parts, and ridge of the os trapezium ; and internally to the unciform and pisiform bones. By its upper border it is con- nected with the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and by its anterior surface it joins the palmar fascia. On it lie the palinaris longus and the ulnar artery and ner%'e. * Three palmar interosseous muscles, a.

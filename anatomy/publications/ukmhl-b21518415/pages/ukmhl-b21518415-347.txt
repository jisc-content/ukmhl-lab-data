ROOT OF LUXG. 33t lung. Occasionally there may bo a trace of the third lobe in the left lung. Besides the difference in the number of tlie lobes, the right huig Difference is larger and heavier, and is wider and more hollowed out at the s'-i^onh" base than the left; it is also shorter by an inch. The increased i^'uss- length and the narroAvness of the left lung are due to the absence Fig. 97.* of a large projecting body like the liver under it, and to the direc- tion of the heart to the left side. The root of the Iwuj consists of the vessels entering the fissure on Root of the the inner surface ; and as these are bound together by the pleura and some areolar tissue they form a foot-stalk, which fixes the lung to the heart and the windpipe. The root is situate at the inner Situation, sui'face, about midway l)etween the base and apex, and about a third of the breadth from the posterior border of the lung. In front of the root on both sides, are the phrenic and the anterior Connec- pulmonary nei^ves, the former being at some little distance from it; and anterior to the right root is the descending cava. Behind on both sides, is the posterior pulmonic plexus ; and on the left side tSiere is, in addition, the descending aorta. Above on the right side is the vena azygos; and on the left side, the arch of the aorta. Below each root is the fold of pleura called ligamentum latum 2>nlmonis. In the root of the lung are collected a branch of the pulmonary c'onsti- arteiy, two pulmonary veins, and a division of the air tube (bronchus); tile'root;. * Diagram to show the difference in the anterior border of the right and left lung, the edge being indicated by the dark line; and to mark the different level of the base on the two sides.

211 BOUNDS (3F LATERAL YEXTRICLE. The lower or descending part gf the ventricle winds beneath the Thedescend- nptic thalamus, and forms a cm-ve like the half-bent fore finger. 1'="^* '■ The roof is formed by the optic thalamus and the contiguous part ' of the hemisphere. In the floor is a large curved, convex eminence, somewhat indented at the end,—the hippocampus major (1) ; and along its concave margin is a thin white band—tfcnia ((/), which is prolonged fi-om the fornix. External to the projection of the on1t°*^'®^ Fisr. 63.* hippocampus is another white eminence, the eminentia collateralis >(k), which tapers from above down. In this part of the ventricle is the vascular fringe of the plexus choroides. The septum lucidum (fig. 63, J), or the thin structure between the Septum lateral ventricles, is translucent, and hangs vertically in the middle line along the anterior two thirds of the corpus callosum. It is i.o.siUon, somewhat triangular in form, with the larger part turned forwards, io,.,„^ and the pointed extremity backwards.

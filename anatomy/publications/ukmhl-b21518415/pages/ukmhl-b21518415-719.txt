INTRA CAPSULAR LIGAMENTS OF KNEE. 703 -of tlie tibia by the flexors or by force ; and it is stretched in extreme flexion, in which the tibia is being drawn bade from the femur. , This use will be exemplified by cutting across tlie posterior (in another joint or in another dissection) and leaving entire the ante- rior ; when this has been done the articular surfaces of the tibia can be carried nearly altogether behind tlie condyles of the femui'. Tlie interarticular or semilunar ^fibro-cartilages (fig. 218) cover Semilunar partly on each side the articular surface of the tibia. ajriwo?* They are thick at the outer margin, where they are united by common fibres to the capsule, and are tliin at the hmer edge ; they are characters, hollowed on the upper surface, so as to assist in giving depth Fig. 218.* to the fossfB for the reception of the condyles of the femur, but are flattened below. In- serted into the tibia at their extremities, they are coarsely fibrous at their attachment to the bone, like the crucial liga- ments ; and they become car- tilaginous only where they lie between the articular surfaces. The synovial membrane is re- flected over them. The internal cartilage (a) is Internal is ovoid in form, and is a segment of a larger circle than the external, semi-circu- In fi'ont it is attached by a pointed part to the anterior margin of the head of the tibia, in fi-ont of the anterior crucial ligament. At the back, where it is much wider, it is fixed to the inner lip of the hollow behind the spine of the tibia, between the attachment of the other cartilage and the posterior crucial ligament. The external cartilage (b) is nearly circular in form, and is con- External nected to the bone within the points of attachment of its fellow, cuhu-^in"^" Its anterior part is fixed in front of the spine of the tibia, close to ^^^^ 'â€¢ "the outer articular surface, and opposite the anterior crucial ligament which it touches; and its posterior extremity is inserted behind and between the two osseous points of the spine. This fibro-cartilage is less closely united to the capsule than the internal, for the fore part is in the centre of the joint, and the tendon of the popliteus muscle separates it behind from that mendirane. The outer fibro-cartilage is provided with two accessory bands, one at the fore part, the other behind. The anterior or transverse ligament (r) is a narrow band of fibres itstrans- between the semilunar cartilages at the front of the joint. Some- ^^^^^ '^^^ times it is scarcely perceptible. The vosterior or ascending hand (r/), thicker and stronger than the i>osterior baud. * View of the head of the tibia with the fihro-cartilages attached : the crucial ligaments have been cnt through, a.

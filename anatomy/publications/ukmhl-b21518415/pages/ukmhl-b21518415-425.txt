409 NERVE ROOTS AND GANGLION. the dura mater, and enter the two points of the intervertebral ganghon. The intervertehral ganglion (fig. 123). Each posterior root is pro- Number of vided with a ganglion (c). The ganglia are reddish in colour, and oval in shape whilst they are surrounded by the dura mater; and construc- their size is proportioned to that of the root. By means of the ti'^"- previous dissection, the ganglion may be seen to be bifid at the Each is inner end (fig. 123 b), where it is joined by the bundles of fibrils of the root (b) ; it might be said to possess two small ganglia, one for each bundle of fibrils, which are blended at their outer ends. Sometimes the first or suboccipital nerve is without a ganglion. The anterior or aganglionic roots (fig. 123 a) arise from the side of the spinal cord by filaments which are attached irregularly—not without in a straight line, and approach near the middle fissure at the lower S'^'^S^^o^' end of the cord. Taking the same direction as the posterior root to the inter- Pierces ^ . ^ . dura mater, vertebral foramen, the fibrils enter a distinct opening in, and have and joins a separate sheath of the dura mater. In their further course to the roou'eyond trunk of the nerve they are gathered into two bundles (fig. 123, b, a), ganglion, and pass over the ganglion without joining it. Finally the anterior root blends with the posterior beyond the ganglion, to form the trunk. Characters of the roots. Besides variations in the relative size of ^f'^roots'^'^ the two roots, the following characters are to be noted:— Union of the fibrils. The fibrils of contiguous anterior roots may be intermingled, and the fibrils of the neighbouring posterior roots join. may be connected in a like manner; but the anterior is never mixed with the posterior root. Size of the roots to each other. The posterior root is larger than Posterior . , , . . , 1 ji 1 r root largest, the anterior, except m the suboccipital nerve; and the number ot the fibrils is also greater. Further, the posterior is proportionally ^YjyPi"^*j°g^ larger in the cervical than in any other group ; in the dorsal nerves in neck! there is but a very slight difference in favour of the hinder root. Size of both roots along the cord. Both roots are larger where the 1^°°*^*^^^^ nerves for the limbs arise, than at any other part of the cord; and down. they are greater in the nerves to the lower than in those to the upper limbs.

As the apertures of transmission Oblique in * ■% f* * ' f* ii Liicir course* from the spinal canal are not opposite the place of origin ot the nerves, the roots must be directed more or less obliquely. This obliquity increases from above down ; for in the upper cervical nerves the roots are horizontal, but in the lumbar and sacral nerves Most so they have a vertical direction around the end of the medulla spinalis, "'''^''"''^i' The appearance of the long fibrils around the end of the cord (fig. 124) resembles the extremity of a horse's tail, and bears appro- "j^l^J/"™ priately the term cauda equina. equina. The length of the roots increases in proportion to their obliquity. P'^J^S^^^^^g Between the origin and the place of exit of the roots of the lower cer- vical nerve the increase amounts to the depth of one A^ertebra ; in the J°^j^^^"ve lower dorsal nerve it equals the depth of two vertebra); and in the

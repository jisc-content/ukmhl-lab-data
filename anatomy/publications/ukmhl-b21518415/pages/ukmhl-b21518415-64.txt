48 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Upper and lower. Two con- Dissect infe- rior oblique, The upper and lower recti elevate and depress the fore part of the ball around a transverse axis ; but as their fibres are directed obliquely outwards, the upper muscle turns the pupil up and in, and the lower muscle turns it down and in. By the simultaneous action of two contiguous recti, the ball will be moved to a point intermediate to that to which it would be directed by either muscle singly. Dissection. By opening the optic foramen, the attachment of the recti muscles will be more fully laid bare. To dissect out the Fig. 12.* inferior oblique muscle, let the eyeball be replaced in its natural ]iosition ; then by taking away the conjunctival lining of the lower eyelid near the inner part of the orbit, and removing some fat, the muscle will appear beneath the eyeball, bending fi-om the inner to the outer side; it may be followed outwards to its insertion into the ball. Lower The INFERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE (fig. 12, ^) is situate near the nhiitiue anterior margin of the orbit, and dilfers from the other muscles in being directed across, instead of parallel to the axis of the orbit. * Third view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections).

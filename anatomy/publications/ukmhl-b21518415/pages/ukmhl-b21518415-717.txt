701 SYNOVIAL SAC AND FAT AROUND KNEE. sends a pouch between the tendon of the pophteus and the external fibro-cartihige and the head of the tibia : it is also reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. There are three named folds of the synovial membrane. One in ttn-n-mi into the centre of the joint is the mucous ligament (a), which contains ugameuts!*'^ small vessels and some fat, and extends fi-oni the interval between the condyles to the fat below the patella. Below and on each side of the patella is another fold—alar ligament (b and c), which is continuous with the former below the patella, and is placed over a mass of fat : the inner (b) is prolonged farther than the outer by a semilunar piece of the serous membrane. At the back and fi'ont of the articulation pouches are prolonged Pouches, beneath the tendons of muscles. Behind there are two, one on each side, between the condyle of the femur and the tendinous head of two behind the gastrocnemius. On the front, the sac projects under the extensor muscle one inch above the articular surface; and if it communicates and one with the bursa in that situation, it will reach two inches above the joint-surface of the femur. When the joint is bent there is a greater length of the serous sac above the patella. Fat around the joint. Two large masses are placed above and Articular below the patella, and some fat is located around the crucial liga- ments. The infi-a-patellar mass, the largest of all, fills the interval be- below the- tween the patella with its ligament and the head of the tibia, and i^^*®^^* > gives origin to the ridges of the synovial membrane. From it a piece is continued around the patella ; but it is larger at the inner margin of the bone, than on the outer, and overhangs the inner perpendicular facet. During extension of the joint the infra- patellar pad is applied to, and lubricates the articular surfaces of use the femur. The supra-patellar pad is intei-posed between the triceps extensor above the and the femur around the top of the spaoAial sac, and is greater i'**®^'''- on the outer than the inner side.

In this step the student must be careful of a small transverse band wliich connects anteriorly the interarticu- lar cartilages. The remains of the capsule and other Hgaments, and the synovial membrane, are next to be cleared away from the front and back of the crucial ligaments, and fi'om the interarticular cartilages.

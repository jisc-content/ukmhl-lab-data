277 CUTANEOUS VEINS OF FOREARM. from the front and back of the forearm, without injury to the numerous superficial vessels and nerves beneath; and it should be taken also fi-om the back of the hand, by prolonging the ends of the transverse cut along each margin to a little beyond the knuckles. The whole of the fore finger should have the integument removed fi-om it, in order that the nerves may be followed to the end. The superficial vessels and nerves can be now traced in the fat; Seek the they have the following position, and most of them have been vessois'and partly dissected :—Along the inner side, in fi-ont of the forearm f^^^^ Avith the ulnar veins, is the contmuation of the internal cutaneous nerve ; and near the wrist there is occasionally a small offset fi-ora the ulnar nerve. On the outer side with the radial vein is the super- ficial part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Close to the hand, in the centre of the forearm, and inside the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis which can be rendered prominent by extending the wrist, the small palmar branch of the median nerve ■should be sought beneath the fat. On the ulnar artery, close inside the pisiform bone, a small palmar branch of the ulnar nerve is to be looked for. At the back of the forearm the largest external cutaneous branch behiud, •of the musculo-spiral nen'^e is to be traced onwards ; and offsets are to be followed to this surface from the nerves in fi"ont. On the posterior part of the hand is an arch of superficial veuas. and on the Winding back below the ulna is the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve ; ^and. and lying along the outer border of the hand is the radial nerve : these should be traced to the fingers. Cutaneous Veins. The superficial veins are named median, radial, Subcuta- and ulnar, from their position in the limb. ofthefore- Superficial arch on the hack of the hand. Tliis arch is more or less ^^"^ perfect, and receives the posterior superficial digital veins. At the ^^^^ sides the arch terminates in the radial and ulnar veins. The radial vein begins in the outer part of the arch above men- ra'-^i^'l; tioned, and in some small radicles at the back of the thumb. It is continued along the forearm, at first behind and then on the outer border as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein ■by its miion with the outer branch of the median vein (fig. 76, The ulnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the front j.'^^'^'^^^^g and back of the limb :— The anterior arises near the wrist by the junction of small roots anterior from the hand, and runs on the inner part of the forearm to the elbow ; here it unites with the inner branch of the median, and forms the basilic vein (fig. 7G, ^). The posterior ulnar vein is situate on the back of the limb. It ^^^J^^^' commences by the union of a branch, "vena salvatella," fifom the back of the little finger, with an ofliset of the venous arch; it is continued along the back of the forearm nearly to the elbow, and bends forward to open into the anterior ulnar vein. The median vein takes origin near the wrist by small branches median, which are derived from the palmar surface of the hand ; and it is •directed along the centre of the forearm nearly to the elbow.

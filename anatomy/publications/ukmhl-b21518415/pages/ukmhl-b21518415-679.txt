Mocement. In this ball and socket joint, there are the same kinds of movement as in the shoulder, viz., flexion and extension, abduc- tion and adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion and extension. In the swinging movement flexion is freer than extension, the thigh being capable of such elevation as to touch the belly. During swinging the head of the femur revolves in the bottom of the acetabulum, rotating around a line corresponding with the axis of the head and neck ; and the rapidity and extent of the movements do not endanger the security of the joint, the head of the bone not having any tendency to escape. In flexion, the back of the capsule and the ilio-trochanteric band are put on the stretch ; and in extension, the strong ilio and pubio- femoral bands are tightened. In abduction and adduction the femur is removed from, or brought * Hip joint opeued, to show the interarticular or round ligament, c. Part of the capsuJe. h.

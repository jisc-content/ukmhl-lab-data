FIBRES OF OBLONG MEDULLA. 193 fibres of the lateral tract, the anterior pyramid is to be cut across on the right side, between its decussation and the olivary body (fig. 57), and to be raised towards the pons. The lateral tract of the medulla is prolonged inferiorly into the Lateral ^lortion of the spinal cord between the anterior and posterior roots lueduUa of the nerves. The continuation of the tract (fig. 57) ascends ■beneath the olivary body, and leaving the sm-face of the medulla pass deeply, enters the pons. The olivary hodi/, and its fillet (fig. 57, c). The olivary mass oiivaiy ■consists of three parts, viz. a gray incashig layer, a nucleus, and a composi- band prolonged from it—the fillet. Fig. 57.* When the olivary body has been sliced obliquely, a very thin 'vvavy layer of gray substance surrounding a nucleus of whitish ■matter will be apparent: this is the corpus dentatum (fig. 58, /). It forms a thin capsule or bag, having a zigzag outline in a section, is an incom- with the dilated part towards the surface, and the narrowed part },^Jf*,j ■or neck open and directed backwards near the middle line. It i""'!- consists of small nucleated, and ramified nerve cells.f * Fibres of the lateral tract and of the olivary body. a. Anterior pyramid fibres, cut through, and raised as far as the optic thalamus, b. Lateral ti-act of the medulla oblongata, c. Olivary body, and fillet of the olivary body issuing at the upper end. d. Fibres of the lateral tract in the pons and crus cerebri, c. Superficial, and /. Deep transverse fibres of the pons, cut through, and turned outwards, f/. Locus niger in the cms cerebri, bet'ween the fibres of the lateral tract and pyramid. f The arrangement of the fibres in the sac is most complicated, and a fuller account may be obtained by consulting Mr. Clarke's Paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1858. o

DISSECTION OF THE UPPEE LIMB. 314 raised line extends from front to back, and is received into the hollow of the trochlea of the humerus. Across the bottom of the cavity the cartilage is wanting completely, or for a greater or smaller distance. End of the The end of the radius presents a circular depression with a raised radius. margin. In the bent state of the joint the hollow of the radius fits on the outer eminence of the humerus, and the bone is supported during rotation of the limb. Kind of Movement. This joint is like a hinge in its movements, and permits motion: ^^^^ flexion and extension. bending. In flexion the bones of the forearm move forwards, each on its own articular sm-face, so as to leave the back of the humerus, uncovered. The extent is checked by the meeting of the bones of the arm and forearm. Owing to the slanting surface of the humerus the hand falls inside the limb when the joint is fully bent. state of liga- The ligaments are relaxed, with the exception of the following^ ments, ^j^^ ^j^^ posterior, and the hinder part of the internal lateral, extending, In extension the ulna and radius are earned back over the articular surface of the humerus until they come into a line with the arm- bone.

In this joint the head of the radius tnd by received into the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and is kept in place by the following ligamentous band :— H ^ament "^^^^ annular or orbicular ligament (fig. 91, a) is about one third aroumrthc of an inch wide, and is stronger behind than before ; it is placed K,"^*'"^ around the prominence of the head of the radius, and is attached to the anterior and posteiior edges of the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Its upper border, the widest, is connected with the ligaments of the elbow joint; but the lower is fi-ee, and is applied around the neck of the radius.

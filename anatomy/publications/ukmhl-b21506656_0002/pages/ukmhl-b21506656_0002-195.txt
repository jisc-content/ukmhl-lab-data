Into these calyces the apices of the pyramids of Malpiglu [pyramides renales] fit, though sometimes two pyramids are received into one calyx; there are therefore some twelve to fifteen pyramids in each kidney. In a fresh kidney the pyramids are dark red, and their bases are separated, from the surface of the kidney by the cortex, which is lighter in colour and projects between some of the pyramids as the columm of Bertin [columnse renales]. There is also to be seen in the cortex a series of faint radiating rays known as pyramids of

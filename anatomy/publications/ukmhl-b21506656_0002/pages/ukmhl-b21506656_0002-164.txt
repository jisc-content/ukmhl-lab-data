PRACTICAL ANATOMY 152 The relations of the descending colon are very similar to those of the ascending, the chief difference being that it ends on reaching the iliac crest. It runs downwards and inwards along a sinuous line lying upon the transversalis, quadratus lumborum, iUo-hypogastric, and ilio-inguinal nerves and the last lumbar vessels. It reaches the iliac crest near the outer border of the psoas. Its peritoneal relations are similar to those of the ascend- ing colon, although it is not so uncommon to find that the peritoneum completely surrounds it. The probable ex- planation of this is that, while the ascending colon is always distended with gas, the descending is closely contracted, and only about half the calibre of the ascending. The Iliac Colon is the continuation of the descending colon, and^lies in the left iliac fossa, at first not far from the crest, but parallel to the outer half of Poupart's ligament later on (see Fig. 253). It is in this region that the gut is opened in the modern operation of colotomy. Examine it carefully, and notice how closely it is bound to the iliac fossa; usually there is no meso-colon at all, but if one is present it is always very short. As the appendices epiploicse are well marked, there should be no danger of mistaking a coil of small intestine for this colon in performing a colotomy operation. The Duodenum and Pancreas The duodenum and pancreas should now be studied. Identify the pyloric orifice by pressure between the finger and thumb; the orifice is situated at the point where the resistance to the fingers euddenly changes. This point is situated on the transpyloric plane already defined (p. 79), and lies I inch to 1| inch to the right of the median plane. From its origin the duodenum passes first backwards and to the right to the neck of the gall bladder; it then turns down- wards, lying to the right of and behind the gall bladder, until

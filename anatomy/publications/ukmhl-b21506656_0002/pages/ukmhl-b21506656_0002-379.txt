JOINTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 367 The Inter-metACAiirAL Joints lie between the bases of the four inner metaccarpal bones, and the articuhvr ciivities are continuous with the carpo-metacarpal. All four bones are joined together by palmar, dorsal, and very strong inter- osseous ligaments. Notice on opening these joints that they only extend a very little distance between the bases of the metacarpal bones. The various articular cavities in relation to the carpal bones should now be revised. They are:â€” (1) The Inferior Radio-ulnar Cavity, usually completely shut off by the triangular fibro-cartilage. (2) The Wrist Joint, always shut off by the interosseous ligaments between the bones of the proximal carpal row. (3) The Cuneo-pisiform Articulation, always shut ofi" from the rest. (4) The Common Central Joint Cavity, which includes the intercarpal, some of the carpo-metacarpal, and the inter- metacarpal joints. (5) The Carpo-metacarpal Joint of the Thumb, always completely shut off. (6) The Carpo-metacarpal Joint cavity for the two inner digits. This may or may not be a separate cavity from the common carpal sac. The Metacaepo-phalangeal Joints of the Foue Innee Fingers have a complete capsule,of which the palmar ligament is very thick for some distance above the base of the phalanx, though where it is attached to the metacarpal bone it is quite thm. Take a fine, sharp saw and make a median sagittal section right down one of the fingers; where this passes through the metacarpo-phalangeal joint the difference between the thick and thin parts of the palmar ligament will be easily seen. The thick part is called the glenoid ligament [lig. accessorium volare], and indeed recalls the glenoid liga- ment of the shoulder, since it is made of fibro-cartilaare and serves to deepen the socket for the head of the metacarpal bone. It differs, however, from its namesake of the shoulder

5 THE THORAX Behind these vessels the muscular fibres of the triangularis scerni muscle will be seen passing upwards and outwards. A better view of it will be obtained later. THE PLEURAL CAVITIES [CAVA PLEURA] The Pleural sacs are two large serous cavities situated one on either side in the lateral portion of the thorax, and invaginated on their medial aspect by the lungs. As they are very subject to disease, it is a matter of great importance to the student that he should know the extent and relations of the sacs. Remove three or four inches of the mid portions of the 6th, 7th, and 8th ribs on the left side, thus exposing the parietal pleura or outer layer of the delicate secreting mem- brane which surrounds the lungs. This should then be incised, so that the hand can be passed into the pleural sac. Explore the cavity by passing the hand upwards into the neck, and note its relation to the clavicle, subclavian vessels, and other structures there. It is a wise precaution to wrap two or three turns of a bandage round the wrist before doing this, in order to avoid scratches by the cut ends of the ribs. Next let the hand sweep downwards and inwards in front of the lung and behind the sternum, and then outwards and back- wards along the attachment of the diaphragm. The lung should then be pulled a little forward, allowing the hand to be passed behind, and so the posterior portion of the sac can be explored. Through the aperture made in the chest wall the student should endeavour to see as much as possible of the lung and of the pleural cavity. He will thus find that the pleural sac reaches into the neck for about an inch above the clavicle, that above the level of the second costal cartilages the two sacs are separated by a V-shaped interval, the limit of the pleura passing behind the sterno-clavicular joint, that the sac reaches as low in the mammary line as the 8th, in the mid-axillary as the 10th, and beside the vertebral column as

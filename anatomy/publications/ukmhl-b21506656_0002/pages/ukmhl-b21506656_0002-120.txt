PRACTICAL ANATOMY 108 The clitoris is so deeply sunk in the surrounding tissues that only its tip or glans can be made out at present. The vestibule is the space within the labia minora between them and the vaginal orifice. The orifice of the vagina (Fig. 236, V.) varies greatly in the virgin and in women who have borne children; in the former it is partly closed by a delicate, membranous, cres- centic fold known as the hymen (Fig. 236, H.). This usually T, Fig. 236.—Dissection op the External Generative Organs op the Female. (Diagrammatic.) On the Left Side the Muscles have been dissected away. I.CM- Ischio-cavernosus Muscle. S.V.M.

The orifice of the vagina should be held open with hooks and the interior of the passage examined; if a vaginal speculum is obtainable, it should be inserted. In the nullipara (a female who has not borne children) the mucous membrane is thrown into transverse ridges or

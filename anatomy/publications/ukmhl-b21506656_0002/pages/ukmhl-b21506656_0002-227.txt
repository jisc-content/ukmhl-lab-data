This subperitoneal coat is continuous with the pelvic cellular tissue at the sides and back of the bladder. Dissect away the external longitudinal muscular coat, the middle circular and the inner reticulated, noticing that, when the inner coat is hypertrophied, pouches of the mucous membrane may form in gaps between its bundles.

Now make a transverse section through the prostate and prostatic urethra, and notice the crescentic appearance of the latter. Identify the sinus pocularis and the common ejaculatory ducts.

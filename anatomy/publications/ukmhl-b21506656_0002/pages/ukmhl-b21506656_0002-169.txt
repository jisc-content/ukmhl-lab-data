THE SPLEEN 157 with the tuber omcutale hcpatis, the lesser omentum alone separating them. Follow the superior mesenteric vessels up to the place at which they disappear behind the pancreas [incisura pan- creatis], and notice how the " crook-like " part of the head of the gland is bent round to the right of and then behind them. This part is well named the ijrocessus uncinatics. The Spleen It is now convenient to examine the position and relation of the spleen, an organ to which the dissector has been led already by the splenic flexure of the colon, the tail of the pancreas and the splenic vessels. It is 5 to 6 inches in length, with its long axis coincident with the posterior part of the 10th rib. It lies in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions, and has an upper and lower extremity or pole, an outer [facies diaphragmatica], antero-internal [f. gastrica], and postero-internal [f. renalis] surface, an anterior, intermediate, and posterior border (see Fig. 257). The upper extremity is in relation to the left suprarenal capsule close to the vertebral end of the 10th rib. The lower pole is supported by the phrenico-colic ligament, which passes from the splenic flexure of the colon to the diaphragm. It is important to notice that this lower pole is the most anterior part of the spleen, and comes forwards as far as the mid-axillary line. The outer surface is convex and lies against the diaphragm, which separates it from the pleural sac, lung, and 9th, 10th, and 11th costal arches. The antero-internal surface is concave for the posterior surface of the stomach. On this surface, just anterior to the intermediate border, is the slit-like hilum for the splenic vessels. The postero-internal surface is also concave for the upper part of the external border of the kidney. The anterior border usually exhibits two or three notches. As a rule, the posterior border is not notched. The intermediate border separates the antero-internal from

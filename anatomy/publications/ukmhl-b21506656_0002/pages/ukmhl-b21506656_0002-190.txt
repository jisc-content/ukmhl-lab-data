PRACTICAL ANATOMY 178 subcostal vessels; that the suprarenal capsules have only the diaphragm behind them. The Inferior Vena Cava lies in front of the right crus and right suprarenal capsule, the right inferior phrenic artery, and the right semilunar and aortico-renal ganglia, which latter lie partly anterior to the right renal artery. The Right Renal Vessels lie in front of the sympathetic cord, while tlie right ureter descends immediately to the outer side of it. The inferior vena cava lies throughout to the medial side of the right psoas and right sympathetic cord. Now take the specimen of duodenum, pancreas, and spleen and place it in position, noting that the duodenum lies in front of the right suprarenal, right kidney, renal vessels, ureter, sympathetic cord, inferior vena cava, common bile duct, portal vein, gastro-duodenal artery, aorta, left sympathetic cord, and left psoas. The Pancreas crosses in front of the inferior vena cava, ascending lumbar veins, receptaculum chyli, aorta, left crus, left sympathetic cord, left psoas, left kidney and suprarenal, left renal vessels, and semilunar ganglion. The portal vein and its tributaries are also posterior relations, but have been noticed already. The Stomach Chamber Notice the cavity in which the stomach lies; it is known as the stomach chamber, and is pyramidal or pyriform in shape, the apex of the pyramid lying on the right side and the base on the left. Replace the liver, and notice how it and the diaphragm form the roof of the stomach chamber. Lift up the stomach, and notice howthe pancreas, spleen, left kidney, left suprarenal, and diaphragm form the posterior wall. The base or left wall is made by the spleen and diaphragm. The floor has been removed now, but originally consisted of the transverse colon and meso-colon. The anterior wall has been studied already (see p. 132); it

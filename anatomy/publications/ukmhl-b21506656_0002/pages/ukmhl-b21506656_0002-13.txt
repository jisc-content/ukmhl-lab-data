^^gS^ SCHOOL PRACTICAL ANATOMY VOLUME II THE THORAX The dissectors of the thorax cannot begin their work until the upper extremities have been removed, which seldom takes place until at least a fortnight after the dissection of the body has started. During this period they should study the stermim, ribs, and vertebrae, as well as the articulated thorax, with great care, and should realise how small a portion of the upper part of the trunk is occupied by the thorax in the living person. Let them measure an adult man across the shoul- ders ; the breadth may be some eighteen inches, but of this only four inches represent the upper aperture of the thorax. The term Thorax is applied to that portion of the trunk which is protected anteriorly by a breastplate {Owpa^). It has the shape of a barrel flattened along its anterior and posterior aspects. Its greatest transverse diameter passes through the eighth costal arches. During life its diameters and shape are constantly chang- ing, respiration and circulation being thereby aided. The student should observe that by laying his hands on different parts of his chest all diameters will be shown to increase during inspiration and to decrease during expiration. He may further note that during inspiration the vertebral column in the thoracic region is straightened and moves backwards, that the sternum is carried upwards and for- VOL. II. ^

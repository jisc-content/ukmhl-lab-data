77 THE ABDOMEN posterior layer of Gerota's fascia. This should next be divided when the perirenal fatty tissue will be encountered in which the finger can readily feel the lower pole and outer border of the kidney. In the ilio-costal region the colon and a con- siderable portion of the kidney will be seen to lie upon the transversalis muscle; the rest of the kidney is concealed by the quadratus lumborura. The line of the colon should be carefully noted; it is half an inch internal to a vertical line drawn from the mid point of the iliac crest, and, below the kidney, occupies the angle between the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The parts should now be replaced and stitched up layer by layer. THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL Superficial Anatomy.â€”Identify in the middle line the ensiform cartilage, the umbilicus, and the symphysis pubis. It will be noticed in identifying the first of these that the ensiform cartilage is on a deeper plane than the front of the gladiolus, and that at the gladiolo-ensiform junction a distinct depression is felt. This, in popular language, is known as the " pit of the stomach." By passing the finger outwards from the symphysis pubis for one inch the spine of the pubis will be localised (see Lower Extremity, p. 368, vol. i.), and between the two is the pubic crest. Directly above the pubic spine is the external abdominal ring [annulus inguinalis subcutaneus], which is larger in the male than in the female, and in the former may easily be explored^ in the livmg subject by invaginating the scrotum and passing the index finger up along the spermatic cord. Between the anterior superior spine and the spine of the pubis the depression caused by the ligament of Poupart [lig. inguinale] should be noted. In females who have borne children the lower part of the

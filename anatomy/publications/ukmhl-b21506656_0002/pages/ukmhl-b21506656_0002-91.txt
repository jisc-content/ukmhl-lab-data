THE ABDOMEN 79 the use of a blue pencil, viz. the subcostal, the intertuber- cular, and the right and left mid-Poupart. The first two are horizontal; the last two are vertical. The subcostal line passes through the most dependent points of the lower costal margin seen from the front, points formed, as a rule, by the tenth costal cartilages. The interttihercular line passes between the tubercles on the iUac crest two to three inches behind the anterior superior iliac spine. The mid-Poupart lines pass vertically upward through the mid points of Poupart's ligament. By these lines the following nine regions are marked out: In the middle, from above downwards, the epigastric, umbilical, and hypogastric, and on each side the hypochond/riac, lumbar, and iliac. Another hne should now be drawnâ€”the transpyloric line of Addison; it is a horizontal hne passing through the mid point of a line from the upper border of the manubrium sterni to the upper border of the symphysis pubis. It usually passes through the pylorus of the stomach and just above the hila of the kidneys; it corresponds in level to the first lumbar vertebra and hes one to two inches above the subcostal line (see Fig. 225). It is convenient to bear in mind that, while the trans- pyloric Ime corresponds to the first lumbar vertebra the subcostal is opposite the third, and the intertubercular opposite the fifth. Dissection of the Anterior Abdominal Wall The skin must now be reflected. To do this make a median incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis. 1 his incision should pass on each side of the umbilicus which should be retained in situ. Next make two other indsions one horizontal at the level of the gladiolo-ensiform junction the other along Poupart's ligament. The skin should now be reflected outwards in one sheet, the markings of the sub- costal, mid-Poupart, and transpyloric lines being preserved

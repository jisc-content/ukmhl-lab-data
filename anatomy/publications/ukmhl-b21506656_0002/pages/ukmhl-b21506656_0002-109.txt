THE SPERMATIC CORD 97 the sympatlieLic on the walls of the spermatic artery, though this requires delicate dissection to demonstrate; the other two are the genito-entered, supplying the cremaster muscle, and the ilio-inguinal, the sensory nerve to the scrotum and coverings of the cord. Both of these have been seen in the former dissections. Among the veins are the testicular lymphatics, which re- quire a special and somewhat complicated injection (Gerota's method) to show them up. Dissect all the structures which can be identified downward to the testicle, and look very L.V. Sc.N. r.M. I.I.N, Cr.A, C.'N. Sp.A. V.D. D.A, Fig. 2.'?2.â€”Section of the Right Speematic Cord. V.D.

Whether this be seen or not, it should be looked for and remembered, because it is a little tubular remnant which may give rise to cystic tumours. The spermatic artery, if well injected, will be seen to give twigs to the epididymis and then enter the back or hilum of the testis. The deferential artery supplies the vas and greater part of tlie epididymis, where it anastomoses with the spermatic, so that, even if the latter is ligatured or cut, the testis mav VOL. II. Q

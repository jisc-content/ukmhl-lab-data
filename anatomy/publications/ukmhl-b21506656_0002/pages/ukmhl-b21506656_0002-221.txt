209 THE PELVIC VISCERA inwards behind the posterior division of the internal iliac rein to the anterior sacral foramina. The upper artery dis- appears through the first of these foramina, but the lower runs down on the inner side of the lower foramina, through which it gives small spinal branches, and anastomoses freely Avith the middle sacral artery, which is running down the front of the sacrum in the mid line. On the inner side of the lateral sacral arteries look for the sympathetic cord, which in the sacral region usually has five ganglia. In front of the coccyx the two cords of opposite sides meet in a small ganglion known as the ganglion impar. In dissecting the arteries of the pelvis, a large number of veins will have to be removed. They drain the vesical and prostatic plexuses and the lower part of the rectal or hsemorrhoidal plexus into the internal iliac veins. It is very important to notice that the upper and greater part of the haimorrhoidal plexus drains upwards into the inferior mesenteric vein and so into the portal system. Internal Riac Lymph Nodes are found along all the branches of the internal iliac artery, but the largest are at the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic notch. 8acral Lymph Nodes should also be looked for close to the sacra media artery. Examination of the Pelvic Viscera The pelvic viscera should now be removed and their structure examined. The prostate should be carefully drawn up from the trough which the two levatores ani muscles form for it. Some fibres of these muscles, as well as the pubo-prostatic ligament, must be carefully divided, after which the prostate Avill be lifted easily, and the urethra may be divided below it, preferably with scissors. The rectum should be divided where the levator ani is closing round it; this means that

291 THE ARM the triceps it gives off its two external cutaneous branches, ah-eady examined; it then pierces the external intermuscular septum, and lies in front of the external supra-condylar ridge between the origins of the brachio-radialis and brachialis anticus muscles, which should be forcibly dragged apart to expose it. Here it gives ofi" twigs to the brachio-radialis, extensor carpi radialis longior, elbow joint, and occasionally to the brachialis anticus, and finally divides into its two terminal branches, the radial [ramus radialis superficialis] and posterior interosseous [ramus radialis profundus], a little above the level of the external condyle. It will save much future difficulty if the dissector will realise that, at its division, the musculo-spiral sends all its remaining sensory fibres into the radial and all its motor fibres into the posterior interosseous nerve. The siiperior -profunda artery [a. profunda brachii] accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve in the spiral groove. When it is well injected it will be found to send a small descending articular branch with the nerve to the anconeus down to the anastomosis above the olecranon. The end of the superior profunda may sometimes be seen to anastomose with the radial recurrent artery in front of the external condyle. The coraco-hrachialis muscle rises, in common with the short head of the biceps, from the tip of the coracoid process. The contrast between its fleshy origin and the tendinous one of the biceps has already been noticed. The insertion is into the inner surface of the humerus, just above its middle and close to its inner border. Notice that the muscle is pierced obliquely by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. From the msertion of the coraco-brachialis, and therefore very close behind the brachial artery, the internal inter- muscular septum begins and runs down to the internal condyle. It is attached to the internal supra-condylar rido-e all the way, and separates the triceps from the brachiahs

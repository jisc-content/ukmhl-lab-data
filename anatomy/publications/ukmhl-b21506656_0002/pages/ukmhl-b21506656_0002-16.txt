PRACTICAL ANATOMY 4 the intercostal vessels and nerves satisfactorily, since the outer lip of the subcostal groove overlaps and hides them. The lateral cutaneous nerve will act as a guide if need be. Notice that the vein, artery, and nerve are in this order from above downwards, though in well-injected subjects a second very small collateral intercostal artery may be found in the lower part of the space. Traced forwards, these structures will be seen to sink into E.I.M. Fig. 190.â€”Vertical Section throdgh two Ribs AND AN Intercostal Space. R. Rib. E.I.M. External Intercostal Muscle. I.I.M.

Remove the external and internal intercostal muscles from the anterior inch or two of the upper seven intercostal spaces on the right side, taking care not to damage the underlying structures. Running parallel with the lateral border of the sternum and half an inch from it, the internal mavimary vessels [A. mammaria interna] will be seen.

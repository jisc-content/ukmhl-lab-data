260 PRACTICAL ANATOMY In following the axillary artery down replace the pec- toralis minor for a minute, and notice that it arbitrarily divides the artery into three parts, one above, one behind, and a third below. This division, of course, varies with different positions of the limb, still it is a convenient one as long as the student clearly realises that its limits are variable and uncertain. In each stage of the artery it will have anterior, posterior, internal and external relations, a search for which will bring the dissector into touch with all the important structures in the axilla. First part of the axillary artery, running from the outer edge of the first rib to the upper border of the pectoralis minor. The anterior relations of this part are :— Bones.—The clavicle when the shoulder is depressed. Muscles.—Subclavius and pectoralis major. Fibrous Structv/res.—Costo-coracoid membrane or cellular tissue and costo-coracoid ligament. Arteries.—Acromio-thoracic and some of its branches. Veins.—Axillary and cephaHc, receiving the acromio- thoracic tributaries. Nerves.—External anterior thoracic. Glandular and other /Siritc^'W/res.—Infraclavicular lym- phatics. It will be noticed that every one of these structures has already been examined in exposing the artery. The posterior relations of the first part are :—• Bones.—None. Muscles.—Serratus magnus. Fibrous Structures.—Cellular tissue. Arteries.—None. Veins.—None. Nerves. The posterior thoracic or nerve of Bell and the inner cord of the plexus. Glandular and other Structwres.—^one. These relations introduce two structures which have not

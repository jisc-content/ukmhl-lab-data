268 PRACTICAL ANATOMY a small twig is given off to supply the coraco-brachialis, and this must be looked for with great care as it is not very often seen. The outer head of the median is joined by the inner head in the lower part of the axilla, and then the median nerve, thus formed, continues its course on the outer side of the artery. The branches of the third part of the axillary artery are the subscapular, the anterior circumflex, and the posterior circumflex. The subscapular artery [a. thoraco-dorsalis] is the largest branch of the axillary, and rises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis muscle, which it accompanies to the lower angle of the scapula. About an inch from its origin it gives off the dorsalis scapulae, which, although called a branch, is really larger than the continuation of the subscapular. The main subscapular then gives off muscular branches to the subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and serratus magnus muscles, and is especially important because a chain of well-marked lymphatic nodes is ranged along its course. The nodes drain the back and side of the trunk as low as the umbilical zone. The dorsalis scapulce branch [a. circumflexa scapulae] dis- appears backwards between the subscapularis and teres major; it too is accompanied by some nodes which drain the dorsal scapular region. The anterior circumflex artery [a. circumflexa humeri anterior] is small and runs round the front of the surgical neck of the humerus deep to the coraco-brachialis and biceps. The posterior circumflex artery [a. circumflexa humeri posterior] is much larger and runs backwards, through the quadrilateral space, close to the It is on a lower level than the circumflex nerve. At this point it may be well to recapitulate the lymplmtic nodes of the axilla, since they are of such great practical importance. It will be remembered that a vertical chain

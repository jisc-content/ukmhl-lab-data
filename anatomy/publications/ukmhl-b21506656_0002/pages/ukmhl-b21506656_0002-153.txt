THE LIVER 141 wall of the compartment formed by the meeting of the two layers of the coronary hgament the inferior vena cava can be felt, and should be exposed and divided. The hver can now be lifted out of its bed, a few touches of the knife to divide the posterior layer of the coronary Hgament and the surrounding fascia being all that is further required.

Note how artificial is the distinction between the two surfaces, how gradually one fades into the other. Identify the visceral facets on the inferior surface, replacing the liver in its bed if necessary (see Fig. 249). The posterior surface is formed in its central part by an oblong lobe with its long axis vertical, called the Spigelian lobe, bounded on the right

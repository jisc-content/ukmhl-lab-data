THE AXILLA 263 that this will be a convenient opportunity to examine the whole course of this vein. _ _ The Axillary vein is, like all veins, liable to variation, but generally begins by the junction of the veuse comites of the brachial artery, the basiHc vein, and the subscapular vein. This union usually happens close to the lower edge of the subseapularis or, what is nearly the same thing, the lower edge of the pectoralis minor. It is therefore exceptional to find a large single vein accompanying the third part of the axillary artery, and for this reason the anterior and posterior circumflex tributaries are generally received by the vense comites accompanying the artery here. The other tributaries correspond to the branches of the axillary artery, except that the cephalic vein takes the place of and receives tributaries correspondmg to the acromio- thoracic. Where large tributaries are received or important junc- tions effected is the place to look for valves in veins; one or more might therefore be expected close to the lower border of the subseapularis. As a rule, there is no need to slit open the vein to see these, because the bulging of the blood above is so marked. If, however, the dissector wishes to see what a venous valve is like, he should ligature the vein half an inch above the valve as well as the veins below; then the vein may be longitudinally incised and the blood and clot sponged out. Be very careful in dissecting the vein to look out for lymphatic nodes in close relationship to its wall and lying to its inner side; the nodes found in this chain are often so small in old people that they are not seen. After an amputa- tion of the breast for cancer, the inner surface of the vein is cleaned in removing the fat, cellular tissue and lymphatic nodes of the axilla. The external relation of the first part of the axillary artery is the brachial plexus, the construction, of which is described on p. 43, vol. i. Below the clavicle only the three

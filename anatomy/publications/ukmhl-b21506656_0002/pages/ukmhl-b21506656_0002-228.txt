216 PRACTICAL ANATOMY homogeneous, since cortical and medullary portions can be distinguished ; the former is tibro-muscular, the latter mainly glandular, but traversed by strands of cortical tissue. Below the bladder is the prostatic urethra, about an inch and a quarter long and nearly half an inch from side to side. As it is a little constricted at either end, it has a somewhat fusiform appearance. In a sagittal mesial section through the prostate the prostatic urethra runs at first downwards and then turns a little forwards as well (see Fig. 278). The Pelvic Floor from above.â€”It will be seen now that the levator ani, coccygeus and pyriformis muscles form a pelvic diaphragm or muscular floor to the pelvis. Look, carefully for a linear thickening of the fascia covering the inner surface of the obturator internus, stretching from the back of the body of the pubis to the ischial spine. This is known as the white line of Henle, and from it and its two bony attachments the levator ani hangs like a curtain from its curtain-rod. Dissection of the Female Pelvis The description already given of the male pelvis applies equally well to that of the female in all particulars except those relating to the uro-genital system. In the male, at the base of the bladder, the vesiculae seminales and the vasa deferentia were found, while, surrounding the first part of the urethra, was the prostate. In the female between the rectum and bladder, the uterus and vagina are situated, while, ex- tending outwards, backwards and upwards from the uterus, is the wing-like broad ligament enclosing in its free border the Fallopian tube, and having the ovary projecting back- wards from it. Consequent upon these changes in the viscera there is a corresponding change in the visceral branches and tributaries of the internal ihac vessels and in the peritoneal folds and fossae. The recto-vesical pouch will be seen to be divided trans-

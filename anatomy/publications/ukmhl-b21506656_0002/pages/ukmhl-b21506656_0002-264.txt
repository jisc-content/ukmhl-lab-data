It is best to secure the nerve in the fourth intercostal space first, and then to Avork downwards; afterwards, by continuing the line up into the dense cellular tissue of the axilla, the third and second branches may be found. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve often wants an anterior division, but the posterior division is very large and runs across the axilla to the inner side of the arm; Fig. 291 â€”Section of the Breast of a Woman 7 Months Pregnant.

Compressed Cellular Tissue looking like a Sheet of Fascia. it is known as the intercosto-humeral nerve [n. intercosto- brachialis], and should not be followed into the arm at present. The posterior branch of the third lateral cutaneous nerve has often a similar distribution, and may join the second. Notice how easily these nerves might be cut in incising the axilla during Hfe, though the result would only be a slight loss of sensation (anaesthesia) of the inner side of the arm. The mammary gland is usually atrophied in the female subjects found in the dissecting-room. In the rare cases in

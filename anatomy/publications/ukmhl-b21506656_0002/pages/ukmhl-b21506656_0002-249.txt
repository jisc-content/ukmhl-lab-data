THE PELVIS 237 lateral sacro-coccygeal ligament. forward dislocation of the sacrum. Notice, too, the obliquity of the joint as seen in transverse section; anteriorly, or, more correctly speaking, below, in the erect position of the body, the sacrum extends much farther outwards than it does behind (dorsally). Both the sacro-iliac joints and the sym- physis pubis are true symphyses; that is, they have a layer of cartilage on both bony surfaces connected by intervening fibrous tissue. Occasionally synovial spaces occur in both joints, but they are small and inconstant, and hardly entitle these to rank with the arthrodia or gliding articulations, which are the next higher stage in the classification of joints. The joints between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum are in series with those between the other vertebrae, and only noteworthy on account of the wedge-shape of the intervertebral disc, the base of the wedge being anterior and the edge posterior. In addition to the sacro-coccygeal ligaments already men- tioned, some strong ligamentous fibres pass between the superior cornua of the coccyx and the inferior cornua of the sacrum —^Ae inter articular sacro-coccygeal ligament—and also fibres between the transverse process of the first coccygeal vertebra and the lateral angle of the sacrum—the

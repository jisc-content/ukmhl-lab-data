THE BACK OF THE FOREARM 337 Superficial Structures It will be noticed on clearing away the superficial fascia that, although there is a plexus of large veins on the dorsum of the hand, there are few on the dorsal surface of the fore- arm. This is due to the fact that the larger veins curve round the radial and ukiar borders of the forearm to reach the anterior surface. There are three cutaneous nerves on the back of the fore- arm :— 1. The posterior branch of the onuscido-cutaneous. Look for this running back round the radial border of the forearm, an inch or two below the external condyle; it is not a very large branch, but can usually be dissected as far as the wrist, where it communicates with and overlaps the radial nerve. 2. The lower external cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve. This will be found nearer the mid line of the forearm, and may often be traced well on to the dorsum of the hand. 3. The posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve.— This should be looked for curving round the' ulnar side of the forearm, only a little distance below the internal condyle. These three nerves communicate with one another by their terminal tv/igs. On the dorsum of the hand the skin is supplied by the radial and by the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. The radial nerve has been traced as far as the lower third of the front of the forearm, where it disappeared deep to the tendon of the brachio-radialis muscle. If the posterior border of the tendon is carefully dissected, the nerve will be easily picked up, and will be seen to divide into branches for the dorsum of the thumb as well as the index and outer side of the medius fingers. It very often suppHes in addition the sides of the cleft between the medius and annularis. It has already been noticed how the branches of the median supply VOL. n. V

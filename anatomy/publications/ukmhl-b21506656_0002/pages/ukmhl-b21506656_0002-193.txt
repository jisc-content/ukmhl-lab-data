THE STOMACH CHAMBER 181 hepatic veins. Make a few sections through the liver sub- stance across these veins, thus tracing them farther and farther away from the vena cava as they become smaller and more numerous. Find the portal vein once more in the transverse fissure, Branches of Tributaries of Po^t^l Vein Fig. 267.â€”Section of the Liver to show its Naked-eye Stkuctore. and make a series of tangential sections through the liver so as to cut these vessels across. Now make one great vertical incision through the middle of the liver, and compare the cut vessels with those of the two former series. It is usually said that the hepatic vein's tributaries may be distinguished fairly easily from the branches of the portal vein, because the former are very thin-walled and are so closely adherent to the liver substance that they do not collapse. In our experience all the vessels are usually open, but the branches of the portal vein may be readily known, because they are accompanied by branches of the hepatic artery (see Fig. 267).

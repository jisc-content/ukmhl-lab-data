250 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the body; when the arm is raised higher, it will be felt that the movement is due to rotation of the scapula. Adduction is the opposite of abduction. Flexion of the shoulder is when the arm is brought forward, and, like abduction, is only possible for a quarter of a circle at the shoulder joint. Extension is the opposite of flexion, but is not so free, since the scapula begins to move long before the arm has gone back through ninety degrees from the vertical position of rest. External rotation is the action produced by twisting the arm in such a way that the lesser tuberosity of the humerus moves outwards while the reverse movement is internal rotation. Skin Incisions (1) Make a median vertical incision from the suprasternal notch to the xiphoid or ensiform cartilage. (2) From the top of this incision make a horizontal one along the clavicle until the acromion is reached, but be care- ful not to go deeper than the skin. (3) From the outer end. of this make a vertical incision down the outer side of the shoulder until the lower part of the deltoid convexity is reached, i.e. for three or four inches. (4) From the lower end of incision number three cut horizontally inwards across the long axis of the arm to a point a little below the anterior fold of the axilla. This incision must be very carefully made, and should merely expose the subcutaneous fat. (5) From the lower end of number one make a horizontal incision outwards as far as the mid-axillary line, i.e. a line dropped vertically from the middle of the axilla when the body is in the erect position. Never forget that in all descriptions the body is assumed to be in the " anatomical position," that is to say, standing upright, Avith the arms by the side and the palms turned forwards.

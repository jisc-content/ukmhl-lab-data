PRACTICAL ANATOMY 262 hitherto been consideredâ€”the serratus magnus and the posterior thoracic nerve. The Serratus magnus [m, serratus anterior] runs back- wards from the upper eight ribs to the vertebral border of the scapula, which it pulls forwards, thereby increasing a person's reach by about three inches. It makes all the differ- ence between the thrust and the lunge in fencing, and is sometimes known as the fencer's muscle. The whole of its origin by fleshy digitations from the ribs should be cleaned, and it will then be seen that the first of them comes from the first and second ribs and passes outwards and backwards behind the artery. The second digitation comes from the second rib behind and below the first, so that the second rib has two digitations attached to it. From the fifth to the eighth ribs the serratus magnus interdigitates with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. In cleaning the origin of this muscle notice how the lateral cutaneous nerves, already found, come out between the digitations, having already divided into anterior and posterior branches. The work of cleaning the surface of the serratus magnus should be continued backwards until the posterior thoracic nerve [n. thoracalis longus] comes into view, running verti- cally downwards on the inner wall of the axilla, and giving off branches to the different serrations of the serratus magnus. Follow it up to where it passes behind the first part of the axillary artery, and notice that it is the only structure of any importance on the inner wall of the axilla. For this reason when an incision has to be made into the axilla the edge of the knife is turned towards the inner wall. The dissectors of the head and neck will later on stow the origin of the posterior thoracic nerve from the fifth, sixth, and usually the seventh cervical nerves (see p. 38, vol. i.). TJie only internal relations of the first part of the axillary artery are the axillary vein and cellular tissue, so

THE ABDOMINAL AVALL 87 the anterior cutaneous nerves will be found coming through the rectus muscle after having supplied it. At the lower end of the sheath, lying immediately in front of the rectus muscle, there is often a small triangular sheet of muscle —the j:>2/ra7?ii(:ZaZ'is—which arises from the pubic crest, and is inserted into the loAver inch or so of the linea alba. Entering the deep surface of this muscle will be found a twig of the last thoracic nerve. The origin of the rectus is seen when the pyramidalis is turned down; it is by two heads, an inner small one from the anterior pubic liga- ments, and an outer, larger, from the crest of the pubis. Its insertion is into the superficial surfaces of the 5th, 6th, and 7th costal cartilages and ensiform cartilage. The rectus muscle should now be separated by means of the handle of the scalpel from the posterior wall of the sheath. This can be accomphshed with perfect ease, for there is no union between the tendinous intersections and the posterior wall of the sheath. Lying between the rectus and the posterior wall of the sheath will be found, above, the superior epigastric vessels, and, below, the deep epigastric upper aperture, the latter by piercing the posterior wall of the sheath, which wall is thin and fibrous in the lower quarter of the abdomen, be- cause here the aponeuroses of all three fiat muscles pass in front of the rectus. The free edge, where the transversalis and half the mternal obhque aponeurosis cease to pass behind, sometimes forms a definite crescentic fold with its concavity downwards and is known as the semihmar fold of Douglas [linea semi- cu-cularis]. Often, however, the transition is less abrupt and two or three indefinite transverse bands are all that can be seen. Quite low down the conjoined tendon blends with the posterior wall and again thickens it. Notice that the nerves supplying the rectus enter the posterior wall of the sheath, and that near the cost^rl carti-

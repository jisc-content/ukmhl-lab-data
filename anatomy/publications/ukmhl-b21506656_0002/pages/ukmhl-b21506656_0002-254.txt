242 PRACTICAL ANATOMY obliquely downwards and outwards superficial to the crest of the ilium, where they should be handed over to the dissectors of the lower extremity (see Fig. 289). When all these nerves have been dissected out as far as possible, they may be turned towards the middle line, and the trapezius muscle defined. This muscle will be found rising from the external occipital protuberance and a small adjacent part of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, from the liga- mentum nuchw, which stretches from the occipital pro- tuberance to the tip of the seventh cervical spine, and then from all the thoracic spines and the supraspinous ligament which joins their tips. The upper fibres run down and out to the outer third of the clavicle, but the outer border yf-the cervical part of the muscle should not be interfered with, because it is an important landmark in the neck. The fibres from the upper thoracic spines run horizon- tally outwards to the upper border of the spine and acromial process of the scapula, while the lower ones run upwards and outwards, and form a short, flat, triangular tendon, which is inserted into the root of the scapular spme. Opposite the upper three thoracic spines there is a small patch of tendon, which, with its fellow of the opposite side, has a diamond shape. Except for this, and the triangular patch at the root of the scapular spine, already mentioned, the trapezius is entirely fleshy. Clean the muscle, being especially careful to define its lower and outer border, and to get at the same time a good idea of the direction of its fibres. Now reflect the trapezius outwards by cutting through it about an inch away from the mid line, only do not take the incision to the upper and outer border of the muscle, which must be kept intact for the dissectors of the neck. , 1 ^ Be careful not to cut through more than the trapezius, this cannot very well happen if the lower and outer edge has

THE ABDOMINAL WALL 83 be separated from the ihac crest and himbar fascia and turned forwards to its insertion. This procedure exacts con- siderable care, otherwise the underlying transversalis muscle will be reflected with it. The internal obliciuo should be cautiously cut through, and any change in the direction of the fibres noted. A horizontal incision should be made in it, directly inwards from the anterior superior spine, so as to leave that part of the muscle in contact with the inguinal canal for future dissection. An unnamed arterial branch of the circumflex iliac artery often further serves as a guide, since it ascends between the two muscles from the neighbourhood of the anterior superior iliac spine. At the linea semilunaris the aponeu:rosis of the internal obhque sphts into two lamellae, which pass, one in front of and one behind, the rectus. The transversalis muscle [m. tranversus abdominis] will be now in part exposed, and can be seen arising from the anterior two-thirds of the ihac crest, the lumbar fascia, and the internal surfaces of the last six ribs; it passes forwards to blend with the posterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and the horizontal direction of its muscular fibres should be carefully noted. The abdominal wall is thus seen to be muscular at the sides and aponeurotic in front. The fact of the muscular fibres passing in different directions adds greatly to its strength. Make a horizontal incision about three inches long through the transversalis in the region of the flank, but be careful not to cut too deeply. Retract the edges and try to find a delicate membrane lining the deep surface of the muscle; this is the transversalis fascia, really the outer part of the extra-peritoneal cellul?ir tissue free from fat. Deep to it the extra-peritoneal tissue contains scattered flakes of fat, and when these are reached it is a sign that the next cut will open the peritoneal cavity.

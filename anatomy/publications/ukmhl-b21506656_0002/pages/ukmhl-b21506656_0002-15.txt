3 THE THOKAX spending intercostal nerve should be sought, piercing the muscle about midway between the vertebral column and sternum. It should be carefully preserved. The external intercostal muscle [M. intercostalis extemus] will be found to reach backwards to the tuberosities of the ribs, and forwards to the junction of the ribs and cartilages; it is represented between the cartilages by a strong mem- brane—the anterior intercostal membrane. Notice that the muscle extends in an obliquely downward and forward direc- tion from the lower border of one rib to the upper border of the rib below. Detach the muscle from its lower attachment and reflect it upwards, preserving the lateral cutaneous nerve. By this procedure the internal intercostal muscle [M. intercostalis internus] will be exposed, and its fibres will be seen to be oblique in an opposite direction. The internal intercostal will be found to extend between the internal surfaces of adjacent ribs and to reach forwards almost to the sternum, backwards only to the angle of the ribs, beyond which it is, however, represented by a strong membrane—the posterior intercostal membrane—the thickened posterior edge of which is known as the superior costo-transverse ligament [lig. colli costse]. This ligament passes from the lower margin of the trans- verse process of the vertebra above to the upper border of the neck of the rib below, and will be studied later (see p. 68). Resect subperiosteally two inches of the third rib, just behind the mid-axillary line. In order to do this make a longitudinal cut through the periosteum for two inches along the outer surface of the rib, followed by a transverse cut at either end; then with a periosteal elevator or blunt knife raise the periosteum from the bone, injuring the former as little as possible. When the two inches of rib have been made l)are on both surfaces and both borders, cut it away with the bone forceps. This resection is necessary in order to display

FEMALE PELVIC VISCERA 227 During pregnancy the ruptured Graafian follicle forms a large yellow mass known as the corptis luteum. Now stretch out the broad ligaments and hold them up to the light. The ovaries and Fallopian tubes now assume a horizontal position, which, it is very important to realise, is not their position during life. If the observer is fortunate he may see a series of delicate tubules lying above the ovary and radiating like a fan from the outer (as it is now lying) part of the upper edge of that organ. These tubules form the EpooiAoron and suggest the vasa eflferentia in the male. Sometimes a delicate, white, thread-like structure is seen joining the upper ends of the tubules just described, and lying parallel to and below the Fallopian tube. This is the remains of the Wolffian duct in the female, and its outer end is some- times connected with a small hydatid. Occasionally, though rarely, this duct may be traced along the side of the uterus and vagina to the vestibule beyond the hymen. Occasionally, too, a few thread-like tubules are to be found lying between the ovary and uterus and above the ligament of the ovary. These, when present, are known as the paroophoron, and correspond to the paradidymis or organ of Giraldes in the male. The Vagina is a passage inches long, its anterior wall pierced above by the cervix uteri. Its walls are formed of fibro-musGular tissue, lined by mucous membrane, the appearance of which has been noticed already (see p. 108). In transverse section the vagina appears as a slit with its anterior and posterior walls hi contact, except near the orifice, where its section resembles an H. The Bladder in the female is similar in its position and relations to that in the male, except that it is in relation behind to the uterus and vagina instead of to the vesiculte seminales, vasa deferentia, and rectum. The Urethra in the female is a short passage 1 to l\

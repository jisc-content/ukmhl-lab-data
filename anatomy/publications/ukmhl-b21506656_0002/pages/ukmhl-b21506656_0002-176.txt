PRACTICAL ANATOMY 164 be seen that each semihmar ganglion is connected with its suprarenal gland by a very large number ot nerves of con- siderable size (see Fig. 261). The solar plexus sends offshoots along all the arteries of the abdomen, and it is owing to the presence of this great plexus that a blow on the " pit of the stomach" is so dangerous. Between the two crura to the right of the aorta will be found the right ascending lumbar vein, and between the aorta and vein the thoracic duct and receptaculum chyli. The ascending lumbar vein on the left side pierces the corresponding crus. The parts now seen and already mentioned should be carefully cleaned preparatory to removing them en masse. Begin by cleaning the suprarenal capsules and the kidneys, tracing their arteries to their origin and their veins to their destination, and carefully preserving the nerves and ganglia of the solar plexus. Next clean the inferior vena cava and , aorta from where the latter enters the abdomen to just above its bifurcation, tracing the tributaries of the one and the branches of the other as far as possible. The tributaries of the inferior vena cava are, from above downwards:— (1) TJie Hepatic Veins, to be seen in that part of the vessel removed with the liver. (2) The Inferior Phrenic. (3) The Capsular. (4) The Benals. (5) The Right Spermatic or Ovarian. (6) The Lumbar Veins (four on each side). The left spermatic vein usually joins the left renal vein. The branches of the aorta, from above downwards, are:— (1) The Inferior Phrenic, which on the right side passes upwards and to the right, behind the inferior vena cava; on the left side upwards and to the left, behind the oesophagus. On each side the inferior phrenic furnishes a branch to the suprarenal capsule.

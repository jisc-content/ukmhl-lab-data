BLOOD VESSELS OF THE PELVIS The relations of the Prostate are as follows: Superiorly (basal surface), the bladder, vesiculae seminales, and vasa deferentia; antero-laterally, the levatores ani muscles, inferiorly the membranous urethra. The cellular tissue between the gland and the symphysis is dense and fibrous, constituting the puho-prostatic ligaments. Posteriorly lies the rectum, which makes the posterior surface somewhat concave from side to side (see Fig. 274). The Blood Vessels of the Pelvis At this stage, before the viscera are removed, the blood vessels should be reviewed.^ As the pelvis was removed from the abdomen by cutting through the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, the common iliac vessels will be found in the lower segment. The bifurcation of the aorta is opposite the lower part of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and from it the coiwmon iliac arteries run downwards and outwards to the sides of the lumbo-sacral articulation. On both sides the artery has the ureter and ovarian vessels (if the subject be a female) in front of its termination as well as, on the right, the ileum, superior mesenteric vessels, and mesentery in front of its course. On the left side these latter structures are replaced by the pelvic colon and meso-colon and the inferior mesenteric vessels. Behind are the fifth lumbar vertebra, and the two discs adjacent to it, the sympathetic chain, the common iliac vein, and, more deeply, the obturator nerve. Notice that the right common iliac artery has three great veins in relation to it, the two common iliacs, and the vena cava, while the left common iliac artery only has its own vein to the right and behind it. From the point of bifurcation of the common iliac trace the external iliac artery along the inner side of the psoas * If during this dissection more room is really needed, one pelvic wall may be removed as directed on p. 230.

182 PKACTICAL ANATOMY Structure of thk Suprarenal Glands Before making a section of these glands, notice what an enormous number of nerves enter them from the solar plexus. Their connection with the sympathetic system therefore is obviously a very close one. Now cut right through the gland when a yelloAvish cortical layer and a darker medullary portion of a reddish-brown colour will be seen. Structure of the Kidneys Split one kidney vertically, so as to separate the anterior half from the posterior, and open up the hilum. Trace the renal vessels and the pelvis or upper dilated part of the ureter into this opening, after which they will be seen to lie in a cavfe-like space padded up with fat and known as the sinus renalis. Here most of the blood vessels lie in front, of the pelvis, but one branch of the artery passes behind the pelvis and also above it. As long as there is an appreciable amount of pelvis and ureter left, it is quite easy to tell the side of an excised kidney, because the ureter is behind the vessels, except for the branch just mentioned, and will only hang down comfortably when the top of the kidney is uppermost. When, however, the structures are cut quite close to the hilum the direction of the ureter cannot, be known, and the presence of the posterior branch of the artery above and behind the pelvis is usually quite enough to ensure the kidney being placed in its right position (see Fig. 268). Now slit open the ureter and pelvis, and notice whether the latter divides into upper and lower parts, as is often the case. These two parts are known as the infundibula [calyces majores], and they are important to notice because the division moderately often extends right down to the bladder, causing double wreter. It is very rare, however, for the ureter to continue double into the bladder. Each infundibulum, as it approaches the kidney sub-

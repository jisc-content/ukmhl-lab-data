129 THE SMALL INTESTINE to the pile of velvet. If the pieces of jejunuiri and ileum be compared, the valvulse and villi will be found to be larger and more distinct in the jejunum. If next the pieces are stretched and held up to the light, one or more dark oval patches may be seen in the ileum but not in the jejunum. These are known as Peyer's patches [noduli lymphatici aggre- gati]. In dissecting-room subjects, who are almost always old, the lymphoid tissue here as elsewhere is usually atrophied. The patches, which are arranged with their long axis in the S.G. -PP. — - >sr -S.G. S.G. Fig. 244.—A Piece of the Ileum laid open to show a Peyer's Patch (P.P.) and Solitary Glands (S.G.) in its Mucous Com. line of the long axis of the gut, consist of aggregations of lymphoid foUicles, and are represented in the jejunum by solitary foHicles only. By attention to the valvulfe, villi, and patches, it is therefore possible to distinguish a typical piece of jejunum from a typical piece of ileum.^ The Large Intestine The large intestine should now be traced. It begins in the right iliac region as a cul-de-sac, the csecum; from this fT,^lv;}^?"u three feet from the ileo-caecaj valve there is sometimes found a thimblo-hke pouch of the ileum, known as Meckel's diverticulum VOL.

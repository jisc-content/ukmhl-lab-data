277 THE SHOULDER tuberosity of the humerus; its surface is covered by a dense fascia, which is of morphological rather than practical interest. The lower border of the muscle is in very close contact with the teres minor, and in dividing the infra-spinatus care should be taken not to cut the teres minor too. When it is divided, Fig. 298.â€”Dissection of the Shoulder Region prom behind. S.S. Supra-spinatus Muscle. I.S. Infra-spinatus. T.Mi. Teres Minor. T.Ma. Teres Major. D. Deltoid. G.N.

An important anastomosis takes place in the infra- spinous fossa between the end of the supra-scapular artery, branches of the posterior scapular coming through the

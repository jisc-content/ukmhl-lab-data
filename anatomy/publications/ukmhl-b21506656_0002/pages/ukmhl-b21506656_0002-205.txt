THE PELVIS 193 the brim of the pelvis backwards and then downwards and inwards, to lie finally immediately internal to the vcsicula seminalis. The lower part of the vasa deferentia and the vesiculae seminales raise the peritoneum of the floor of the recto- vesical pouch into a transverse ridge known as the recto- genital fold, and so subdivide the pouch into an anterior and posterior compartment. In the female a fold is seen running backwards and out- wards from the neck of the uterus to the side of the sacrum; it is raised by the utero-sacral ligament, which contains some involuntary muscular fibres. The ureter should next be followed by the eye and the finger without disturbing the peritoneum. On entering the pelvis it passes downwards and backwards, in front of and below the internal iliac artery, across the posterior part of the lateral wall to the ischial spine, on reaching which it turns inwards and forwards to the lateral angle of the bladder. In the female, after running behind the ovary, it passes round the neck of the uterus, while in the male it is crossed on its inner side by the vas deferens. Like the vas deferens, the ureter produces a peritoneal elevation of varying degrees of distinctness. An attempt should now be made to examine the pelvis and its contents, as they may be examined in the living subject by a finger in the rectum or vagina, though it is necessary to warn the student that the presence of formalin in the body interferes a great deal with the possibility of this examination. Remove the stitches around the anal orifice and, taking the pelvis to the sink, let a stream of water flow through the alimentary canal from the pelvic colon to the anus, thereby cleansing the passage. Pass the index finger into the rectum, keeping it exactly in the middle line with its palmar surface posterior. By moving the finger up and down much of the anterior surface VOL. II. N

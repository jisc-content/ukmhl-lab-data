98 PRACTICAL ANATOMY still obtain sufficient blood. In rare cases the fcurrica vaginalis may retain its foetal communication with the peritoneum, a communication known as the processm vaghialis., or, more commonly, this may be seen as a delicate fibrous cord, THE PERINEUM In former days it was the custom to tie the body up in what is known as the "lithotomy position" and to dissect the perineum before anything else; but, owing to the harden- ing of muscles caused by the modern use of formalin, the forcible flexion of the thighs so damages the hamstring muscles'that the practice has been largely discontinued; moreover, since lateral lithotomy is an operation seldom practised now, it is not of great importance that students should dissect the perineum in this position. It is quite possible to dissect the perineum with the buttocks raised on blocks and the thighs widely abducted, but it is more satisfactory to wait until the lower extremities have been removed at the hip-joint. As soon as this has been done, the dissection should be undertaken lest the parts become too dry. It is best to begin with the posterior part of the permeum and to follow the vessels and nerves forward. First localise the tuber ischii on each side and the tip of the coccyx behind; if the coccyx has not united to the sacrum, it will be found to be to a slight degree movable. The anus should next be examined lying deep in the natal cleft. By pressing the margins of the orifice aside a white line which surrounds the lower end of the gut—the ichite line of Hilton—will be seen. Small bulbous swellings, due to the dilatation of the submucous veins, are very frequently Ibund just within the anal orifice; these are known as haemor- rhoids or piles. Pressure should now be made (a) between the anus and the coccyx, and (6) between the lateral margin

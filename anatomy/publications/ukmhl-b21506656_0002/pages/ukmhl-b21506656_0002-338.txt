326 PRACTICAL ANATOMY suppurative process starting in the tendon sheath in the thumb may easily spread to the palm and cause widespread mischief if not properly treated. As might be expected, the median nerve, although it Ls packed in with this loose tissue, has no definite synovial sheath. On tracing the flexor carpi radialis tendon it will be found to pierce the anterior annular ligament, since the liid. , Med. Ann.

The Distribution of the Median Nerve in the Hand should now be followed. As soon as it leaves the anterior annular ligament the nerve is superficial to the tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum, and at once becomes rather broader and flatter. It then divides, sometimes into two

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 336 the external coi^dylc of the humerus already, and below that it is covered by muscles until the lower end is reached. Here some of the ridges separating the grooves on its posterior and outer surfaces may be felt, as may also its styloid process on the outer side of the wrist. The back of the wrist joint is easily localised, especially if it be alternately flexed and extended. The head of the os magnum often forms a rounded knob in the line of the middle finger when the wrist is fully flexed. This gives an indication of the transverse carpal joint, and the joint itself can be made out by pressing firmly with the index finger, and flexing, extending, abducting and adducting the carpus. In feeling for all these joints the great point is to slip the finger into the intervals between the extensor tendons. The carpo-metacarpal joints are more difficult to feel, though it may be done in most hands if the fingers are moved about freely enough. The metacarpo-phalangeal joints are easily felt on each side of the extensor tendons. Notice that the first series of knuckles are the rounded heads of the metacarpal bones and not the bases of the phalanges. Notice, too, how greatly the length of the fingers differs in different individuals. The shape and appearance of the finger-tips and nails is always worth noticing, though perhaps all that may be learnt from them hardly comes within the range of a dis- secting manual. Skin Incisions.â€”As the skin on the front of the fore- arm has already been reflected in two flaps, it is of httle practical use to try to make two for the back, since there is nothing to hold them in place. The most convenient thing is to turn do^vn the. whole of the skin of the forearm and hand as far as the knuckles, and to retain it for covering the dissection when put away.

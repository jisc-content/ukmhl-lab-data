335 THE FOREARM AND HAND 3. The Deep Transverse Metacarpal Ligavient, hstenmg the heads of the metacarpal bones together on their palmar "vspccts. 4. The Dorsal Transverse Metacarpal Ligament, fastenmg the heads of the metacarpal bones together on their dorsal aspects. Opposite the bases of the metacarpal bones arteries pass between the two heads of the dorsal interosseous muscles. In the first space the radial artery does so, and in the other three spaces the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch. Now replace the adductor transversus pollicis for one minute, and notice that below it, i.e. nearer the finger-tips, the first dorsal interosseous muscle appears. This appearance, if it has not been specially noticed, is often a point of diffi- culty in the examination-room. THE BACK OF THE FOREARM AND HAND Surface Anatomyâ€”The relations of the soft parts to the surface will be noticed as they are exposed, and may then be identified on the dissector's own forearm and hand, Pbut the following bony landmarks should be made out at once. The subcutaneous posterior surface of the olecranon has already been noticed; from it the finger may be run down the whole length of the posterior border of the ulna until the styloid process at the lower extremity of the bone is reached. When the forearm is pronated the lower end of the ulna is very evident dorsally as a rounded knob. On supinating the forearm the line of the posterior border of the ulna will be found m^arked by a deep groove between the flexor and extensor muscles, and from the surgeon's point of view it is a very important thing to remember that the whole length of the ulna can be explored through the skin. The head of the radius has been felt below and behind

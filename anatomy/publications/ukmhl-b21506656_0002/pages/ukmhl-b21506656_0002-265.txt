THE PECTORAL REGION 253 which it is normally developed it should be examined with great care, because it is such a frequent site of cancer and other troubles. Make a transverse cut right through it, passing through the nipple and reaching down to the subjacent pectoralis major muscle. Notice that the glandular tissue fades very gradually into the surrounding fat, and the two can only be distinguished with great care. On the convex superficial surface pyramidal processes of glandular tissue approach the Fig 292.â€”The same Section as that shown in Fig. 291 after the Breast has been drawn away prom the Pectoral Muscle to SHOW the Cellular Tissue between them. skin here and there, while the intervals between them are fdled with fat, giving the skin over the gland its even contour. On its concave deep surface the gland is only separated from the pectoralis major by a thin bed of cellular tissue contain- ing a little fat. On gently drawing the breast away from the pectoral muscle it will be seen that there is no definite sheet of fascia, though, if the gland is dissected away, the cellular tissue Avill at once condense into an artificial sheet. In certain places minute processes of the gland are said to push their way through the cellular bed, and follow the fibrous

280 PRACTICAL ANATOMY branch. Trace the posterior one first, and look for a twig which it gives off' to the teres minor muscle, swelling at one point into a gangliform enlargement or pseudo-ganglion (see Fig. 299). These pseudo-ganglia differ from the true ganglia on the FrG. 299.â€”Dissection of the Shoulder Region prom behind. S.S. Supra-spinatus Muscle. 7.5. Infra-spinatus. T.il/i. Teres Minor. T.Ma.

The rest of the posterior branch supplies the posterior part of the deltoid muscle and winds round its posterior border, as has been seen already. The anterior branch enters and supplies the front of the deltoid, although numerous

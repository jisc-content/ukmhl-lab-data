PRACTICAL ANATOMY 84 The Inguinal Region The student should now turn his attention to that part of the anterior abdominal wall below the aforesaid horizontal line running inward from the anterior superior iliac spine. On one side the following dissection should be made: Free the external oblique aponeurosis from the underlying internal oblique muscle as far inwards as possible by separating them along the horizontal line, next make an incision from the innermost point thus freed to the inner side of the internal pillar of the external abdominal ring. This triangular por- tion of the' external oblique aponeurosis should be turned downwards and its continuity with Poupart's ligament demon- strated. The latter ligament may now be seen to be attached to the pubic spine and to the inner inch of the ilio-pectineal line, where it forms Gimhernat's ligament [lig. lacunare]. Beyond the pubic spine Poupart's ligament can be readily traced for a considerable distance in front of the symphysis and along the pubic arch, while some of the inner fibres of Poupart's and Gimbernat's ligaments are reflected upwards behind the ring as a delicate fibrous sheet and blend with the anterior sheath of the rectus. These fibres, when dis- tinct, are known as the triangular fascia [lig. inguinale reflexum]. The lower portion of the internal oblique muscle will now be exposed, and it will be seen that it arises from rather more than the outer half of Poupart's Hgament, and passes in an arched manner downwards and inwards to be inserted into the iho- pectineal line. Examine the spermatic cord if the subject be a male, and trace it upwards under cover of the internal oblique. In the female the place of the cord is taken by the roxind ligament of the uterus, a delicate fibro-muscular cord, Avhich, after passing out of the external abdominal ring, loses itself in the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris and upper part of the

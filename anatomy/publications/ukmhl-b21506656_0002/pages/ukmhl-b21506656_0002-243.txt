NERVES OF THE PELVIS 231 to the great sacro-sciaLio foramen, a little in front of the sacro-iliac joint. By using the knife carefully and by keeping a steady trac- tion on the piece of bone thus freed, the latter may be removed with little injury to the vessels and nerves even on this side. The obturator nerve and lunibo-sacral cord have been seen in the dissection of the arteries. In revisinsf the obturator nerve remember that it comes out of the inner and back part of the psoas and lies between that muscle and the external iliac vein, so that, in order to reach the nerve from the opened abdomen, the dissector should draw apart the psoas and external iliac artery, and then, more deeply, the psoas and external iliac vein. Its closeness to the vein is responsible for the pink staining which is often so striking a characteristic of the obturator nerve. The Lumbosacral Cord [truncus lumbo-sacralis] is easily found when the obturator has been located, since it lies a little deeper and a little nearer the mid line than that nerve. The origin of the lumbo-sacral cord from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves has been exposed already. As the cord runs down it passes behind the common and internal iliac artery and vein and crosses in front of the sacro- iliac joint obliquely from above downwards and outwards. This is a relation of clinical importance, since the nerve may be affected in disease of this joint. It is about this point that the superior gluteal nerve should be looked for, rising mainly from the lumbo-sacral cord with a smaller contribution from the first sacral nerve. It passes out of the pelvis through the upper part of the great sciatic notch lying just above the gluteal artery, which is here passing backwards between the lumbo-sacral cord and the first sacral nerve-. The first, second, third, and fourth sacral nerves are easily found coming out of the anterior sacral foramina and having

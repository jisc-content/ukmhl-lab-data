THE ABDOMEN 71 During the first few days, when the body is on its face, the dissectors of the abdomen are usually without work. This, however, need not necessarily be the case, for a little mutual arrangement with the dissectors of the back muscles will enable them to dissect the loin region as soon as the latissimus dorsi has been cleaned and examined. This dis- section, which is practically the exposure of the lower pole of the kidney from behind, is a very important piece of work, and seldom has sufficient attention paid to it. THE ILIO-COSTAL REGION The ilio-costal region is that portion of the posterior abdominal wall which is bounded above by the last rib and below by the iliac crest. The dissector of the upper extremity will have already removed the skin from this region, found the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and cleaned the latissimus dorsi muscle. The posterior border of the external oblique muscle will have been exposed. The surface of this muscle should now be cleaned, a sharp look-out being kept for any cutaneous nerves appearing between the digitations of the muscleâ€”the lateral cutaneous branches of the lower intercostal nerves. The muscle can be readily recognised by the forward and downward direction of its fibres from the lower ribs to the iliac crest. Between the outer border of the latissimus dorsi and the posterior border of the external oblique a small triangular area called Petit's triangle [trigonum lurabale] should be

JOINTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 353 In the Hand (1) Princeps pollicis. (2) Radialis indicis. (3) Palmar interosseous. (4) Perforating. It will further be noticed that, if the term dorsal carpal be substituted for posterior carpal, all the branches of the stage in the wrist have " dorsal" in their names. THE JOINTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY After clearing away as much tissue as can be done with- out approaching the joints too closely, the extremity will generally be the better for a night's soaking in cold Avater. The sterno-clavicular articulation has been examined by the dissectors of the head and neck (see p. 154, vol. i.), so that the first joint to take in hand is the Acromio-clavicular Articulation. This is an arthrodial or ghding variety of the movable joints. The bones are held together by a capsule, the superior ligament of which is stronger than the inferior. Notice that slight gliding of the bony surfaces takes place both upwards and downwards and forwards and backwards. Hold the clavicle as far away from the joint as possible and let the whole arm hang from it, then swing it gently backwards and forwards, when the arm and scapula will be seen to swing like a pendulum from the clavicle; that is to â€¢ say, a rotation round the long axis of the clavicle is possible, in addition to the gliding movement. The acromio-clavicular articulation is obviously too feeble to support the weight of the arm, and in holding it up by the clavicle the scapula is seen to hang from the former bone by two strong ligaments, the coraco-clavicular, which, although they are more than an inch away from the joint, are most VOL.

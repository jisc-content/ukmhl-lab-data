302 PRACTICAL ANATOMY of a man digging shows its action at once. Its nerve supply from the musculo-spiral has been made out already. The external relations of the radial artery in the forearm are the brachio-radialis all the way, its outer vena comes, and the radial nerve in the middle third of the forearm.

Its course in the living may be marked out by drawing a line from the front of the external condyle to the front of the styloid process of the radius, and taking the upper two-thirds of this Hne as a guide; Trace it in front of the outer part of the elbow joint on to the front of the supinator brevis muscle.

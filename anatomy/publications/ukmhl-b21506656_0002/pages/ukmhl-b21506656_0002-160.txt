148 PRACTICAL ANATOMY lips form the ileo-ccecal value [valvula coli], which in the living subject is usually competent, and prevents the regurgitation of food from the large into the small intestines. Notice how much larger and more horizontal the upper lip of the valve is. The lower is oblique, and is practically formed by the wall of the ileum. Below the ileo-ciecal aperture will be seen that of the appendix guarded by a slight valvular swelling of the mucous membrane [valvula processus vermiformis]. A fine probe should be passed through the orifice and along the appendix, which latter should then be longitudinally divided upon the probe and its interior examined. The thickness of the walls and the smallness of the lumen will then be apparent. The thickness is due to the accumulation of lymphoid tissue [noduli f^gregati processus vermiformis]. The ascending colon should now be ligatured below the iliac crest im- mediately above the ileo-ceecal junction and the terminal portion of the ileum, the ctecum, and appendix removed, noting any peculiarity in the shape, peritoneal relations, or blood vessels of parts. The posterior relations of the csecum already given should be carefully and systematically confirmed. The Ascending Colon and Hepatic Flexure The student must now direct his attention to the ascend- ing colon and hepatic flexure. Its direction and sacculated appearance have been already noticed. The ascending colon will now be seen to begin just above the ileo-ca3cal junction, and to end in an interval between the right lobe of the liver antero-externally and the outer border of the kidney postero- internally. Between its origin and termination it passes upwards and slightly outwards along a sinuous line, which runs more or less parallel with the inferior vena cava for four or five inches. Its posterior relations are the ilium, iUacus muscle, iliac fascia, ilio-lumbar vessels, external cutaneous

279 THE SHOULDER The latissimus dorsi has the same action as the teres major, though, owing to the length of its fibres, it is more useful as an adductor than as a rotator. Until they are artificially separated, the upper edge of the teres major and the lower edge of the subscapularis are in close apposition, except where the posterior circumflex artery and circumflex nerve are passing between them, close to the humerus, and the dorsalis scapulse artery is running back- wards more internally. Separate the two muscles and draw the teres major downwards, in doing which the long head of the tricejps will be exposed, rising from the axillary border of the scapula just below the glenoid cavity and running vertically down- wards, a little internal to the humerus, behind the teres major muscle and close to the bone. Here, as seen from in front, is the quadrilateral space of the upper part of the arm, and its boundaries are: above, the subscapularis; below, the teres major; externally, the surgical neck of the humerus; internally, the long head of the triceps. On turning the part over, a posterior view of the quadri- lateral space is obtained; its boundaries are the same as those in front, except that the teres minor replaces the sub- scapularis as the upper limit (see Fig. 298). Through this quadrilateral space pass the circumflex nerve above and the posterior circumflex artery below. It is easy to remember this relationship when it is recalled how closely the nerve clings to the lower border of the subscapularis as it enters the space. Great care must be taken in cleaning the circumflex nerve in this space; the work should be done both from in front and behind. Hook the posterior circumflex artery and its veins well away, and sacrifice any of their twigs which obscure the nerve. By working very carefully, a little branch running up into the shoulder joint may be found, after which the circumflex nerve Avill be seen to divide into an anterior and a posterior

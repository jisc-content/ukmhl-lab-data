THE HEART 23 and the most reliable guide to it is the moderator band. If the septum of the ventricles is now sponged and examuied in its upper and fore portion, a part will be seen from which muscular fibres are almost or entirely absent, pars memhran- acea septi. It is of importance in that it is the last portion of the septum to be formed, and is the portion missing in most cases of congenital deficiency of the septum. It will be more distinctly seen later. The Left Auricle [Atrium sinistrum].â€”Only the ap- pendix of the left auricle is seen from the front. A glimpse of the remainder of this chamber may be obtained by lifting the apex of the heart upwards and examining the posterior surface of the organ. The posterior surface of the left auricle is quadrilateral, and receives the two pulmonary veins of either side. In a few cases the cavity may be opened and examined in this position, and, if possible, it is well that it should be done while the relative position of the parts is undisturbed. In most cases, however, enough light cannot be thrown into the sinus obliquus of the pericardium, in which the work is going on, to enable the dissector to make out details satisfactorily, and, when this is so, it is better to wait until the heart is removed before opening ' the left auricle at all. The most useful incision is in the form of an inverted T, the vertical cut running up between the openings of the pulmonary veins of either side while the lower horizontal incision runs parallel to and just above the auriculo-ven- tricular sulcus, in which the coronary sinus will be found. It is not advisable to slit open the veins, or their apertures will be difficult to find, and important landmarks thus lost. The lower incision should be continued to the left until the auricular appendage is laid open. Clean the interior of clotted blood and injection, when the auricular wall will be seen to be quite smooth, except in the appendix where musculi pectinati are present. In a fresh

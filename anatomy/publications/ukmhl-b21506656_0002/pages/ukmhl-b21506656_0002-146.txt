134 PRACTICAL ANATOMY is the pyloric [a. gastrica dextra]. Any lymphatic nodes associated with these vessels must be carefully cleaned and their position noted; they form an important group, called the nodes of the small curvature [lympho-glandulte gastriciB superiores]. The coronary artery should be traced upwards to the bare area on the posterior surface of the stomach, immediately below the oesophageal aperture. The pyloric llth.r.

If the peritoneum be now carefully removed from the anterior surface of the oesophagus, a number of nerves will be exposed coming down through the oesophageal aperture of the diaphragm—branches of the left vagus ; these branches should be followed along the lesser curvature and over the anterior surface of the stomach.

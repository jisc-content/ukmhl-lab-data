196 PRACTICAL ANATOMY (3) the obliterated hypogastric artery; (4) the obturator nerve, artery, and vein; and (5) the ureter. Near the ischial spine it makes a rather sharp turn downwards and inwards to the back of the bladder and to the inside of the vesicula seminalis. Close to its lower end it receives a small arterial twig from the superior vesical branch of the internal iliac artery. The vesicula seminalis should next be cleaned, and then the bladder. In cleaning the latter begin by tracing the ureter down to its point of entry at the lateral angle. In removing the cellular tissue around the neck of the bladder, great care must be taken not to injure the prostate. In cleaning these various structures the pelvic floor, formed in front by the levator ani muscle and behind by the coccy- geus musole, will begin to be defined. It will also be noticed that the cellular tissue is not everywhere of the same con- sistence. It is more fibrous and membranous and less fatty in two regions:â€” (1) On the inner side of the iliacus and obturator internus muscles, where it is known as the fascia iliaca or parietal layer of the pelvic fascia. (2) On the upper surface of the levator ani muscle close to the pubis. Here it is connected quite firmly to the prostate, and is usually a really definite, silvery-looking, fibrous plane forming the lateral and median pubo-prostatic ligament [lig. pubo-prostaticum laterale et medium]. Many other refinements of the pelvic fascia are described, but they are of little practical importance and are difficult to verify. So far only one half of the pelvis has been dissected, while the other has been left with the peritoneum in situ This second half must now be dissected in the same way as the first. The process will be found much easier, since there is a more complete access to the part, and the student cannot fail to be helped by the knowledge which he has already gained. He should therefore pay particular

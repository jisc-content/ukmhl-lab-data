PRACTICAL ANATOMY 184 Ferrein [pars radiata], formed by collections of kidney tubules. The central part of the kidney is known as the medulla. When the kidney is congested or minutely injected, very small red dots may be noticed in the cortexâ€”the vascular glomeruli. Finally, the tough capsule of the Icidney should be peeled off with the finger and thumb; in a healthy organ it should come away quite easily. Experience teaches us that it will not be a waste of space to impress on the dissector the distinction between the terms sinus, hilum, and pelvis, since they are so often confused or misunderstood. (1) The pelvis is the upper dilated part of the ureter. (2) The sinus is the cave in the interior of the kidney containing the pelvis and the renal vessels. (3) The hilum is the opening into the sinus. The Lower Abdominal Vessels and Nerves The branches of the abdominal aorta and the tributaries of the inferior vena cava which have not been fully traced yet are, on ea,ch side, four lumbar arteries and veins, the veins lying posterior to the arteries; the inferior mesenteric artery on the left side, which enters the pelvis by crossing the left common iliac vessels, and the middle sacral, which arises from the posterior aspect of the aorta a little, but still an appreciable distance, above its termination and runs down in the mid line of the sacrum. The inferior mesenteric artery is accompanied by a well- marked sympathetic plexus, in which a ganglion (the inferior mesenteric) is usually easily found. It gives off the left cohc (Fio-. 263), sigmoid, and superior hsemorrhoidal branches. The Hypogastric Plexus should now be exposed. It is a large sympathetic plexus situated in the angle formed by the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta, and lies in front of the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra. It is formed by filaments on the aorta as well as by hypogastric filaments from the

352 PRACTICAL ANATOMY below the point where the extensor longus pollicis crosses them, and join the two points. Branches of the Second Part of the Radial Artery The loosterior or dorsal radial carpal [ramus carpeus dorsalis] is usually the first branch; it completes the posterior carpal arch already studied. The first dorsal interosseous artery [a. metacarpea dorsalis prima], which, it must be borne in mind, supplies the second interosseous space, is sometimes a separate branch of the radial, but more often rises in common with the posterior carpal. Arteria dorsalis pollicis.—One or two small twigs to the back of the thumb. Arteria dorsalis indicis.—k branch which runs along the radial side of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. None of these branches are of any real importance, though a knowledge of them is sometimes required for examination purposes. The following epitome of the branches of the radial artery may be found useful. There are usually four branches from each of the three stages :— In the Forearm (1) Radial recurrent. (2) Muscular. (3) Superficial volar. (4) Anterior carpal. In the Wrist (1) Dorsal carpal. (2) First dorsal interosseous. (3) Dorsalis polHcis. (4) Dorsalis indicis.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 144 mesentery proper. By the removal of the transverse colon the lesser sac is opened, and the posterior surface of the stomach is fully exposed. CjECum and Appendix Attention should now be turned to the region of the junction of small and large intestine. The student is advised to inflate moderately the ascending colon and caecum by putting the nozzle of the bellows into the hepatic flexure. He will in this way form a clearer idea of the appearance of this portion of the gut during life. The CEBCum will be seen to be a sac measuring in length some 2 inches, in width 2J inches, occupying fairly com- pletely the right iliac fossa, and tending to overlap the psoas. The ileum opens into it on its postero-medial aspect, while about 1 inch below this opening will be found the base of the vermiform appendix. This, as has been seen already, is often attached to the lower margin of the ileum by the ileo- appendicular or bloodless fold. The Appendix [processus vermiformis] varies a good deal in its position, sometimes pointing downwards and to the left, over the brim of the true pelvis, when it usually comes into relationship with the right ovary in the female. At other times pointing upwards and to the left towards the spleen; sometimes it is directed straight upwards behind the ascending colon, while occasionally it is coiled up in the retro-caecal fossa. It is now generally held that the position in which it gains the true pelvis is the commonest; it must be noticed, however, that the appendix seldom forms a straight hne, but is bent upon itself at the point Avhere the mesentery, attach- ing it to the colon and posterior abdominal wall, ends. The appendix also varies in length; from nothing up to 11 inches. Its average is 3 inches. If it is stretched between the fingers and closely examined, it will be seen

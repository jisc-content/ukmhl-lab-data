238 THE UPPER EXTREMITY DISSECTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL LAYERS OF THE BACK It is usually found a convenient arrangement to allot to the dissector of the upper extremity the muscles which attach that extremity to the trunk together with the vessels and nerves supplying them. As the body is now generally placed for the first week on its face, tl;ie first thing the dissector must do, after carefully wrapping up the limb, is to identify the surface markings on the back of the trunk. Surface Markings of the Back of the Trunk In the mid line feel the spines of the vertebrae. The first thoracic is usually the most obvious of these, both to the finger and the eye, while above it the seventh cervical is nearly as distinct. Above these the cervical spines are far from the surface, and no bony point is felt until the external occipital protuberance is reached, from the sides of which the superior curved line runs outwards towards the mastoid process. The spines below the first thoracic become less and less distinct until the lumbar region is reached, where they lie in a hollow between the erector spinas muscles of the two sides. A good deal of the outline of the scapula is visible: the vertebral border, especially if the arms are hanging down over the edges of the table, is very distinct and ends at the upper and lower angles. When the arms are lying by the side of the body the

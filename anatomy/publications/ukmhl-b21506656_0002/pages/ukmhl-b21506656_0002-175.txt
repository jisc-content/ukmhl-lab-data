163 THE SOLAR PLEXUS two crura of the diaphragm. The inferior vena cava will be seen lying in front of the right crus, while directly in front of it lies the portal vein, both veins having been necessarily cut when the liver was removed. It will be seen that the portal vein is formed by the junction of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins behind the head of the pancreas and opposite the right side of the second lumbar vertebra. On tracing what is left of the splenic vein along to the left, the inferior mesenteric vein will be seen to enter it, though the exact point of junction is variable. Notice that the portal vein drains the AYhole of the abdominal portion of the alimentary canal, the spleen, and the pancreas. â–  Slit open the veins of the portal system for some distance in order to notice the absence of valves in them, and then turn them downwards out of the way. The two crura of the diaphragm unite in front of the aorta, at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, to form the tendinous middle arcuate ligament [hiatus aorticus]. Just below this the cceliac axis [arteria cceliaca] will be found dividing after a course of about half an inch into the hepatic, splenic, and coronary or gastric arteries, all of which have now been studied. This axis lies behind the lesser sac of the peritoneum, the posterior layer of which should be carefully dissected away to expose it. Surrounding the axis will be found a network of nerve fibres forming the great solar plextis [pi. coeliacus], contain- ing many ganglia, two of which, the semilunar ganglia [g. cceliaca], are placed, one on either side, in front of the crura of the diaphragm. Into the upper part of each of these ganglia the great sjplanclinic nerves, which have passed through the crura from the thorax, may be traced, while just below the origins of the renal arteries are two more ganglia, the aortico-renal, one on either side. If the part is in good condition it will

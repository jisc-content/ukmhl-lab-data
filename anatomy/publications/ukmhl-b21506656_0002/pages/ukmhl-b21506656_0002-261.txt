249 THE PECTORAL REGION autcrior fold of the axilla, while the posterior fold is caused by the teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles. Running downwards into the arm from under cover of the anterior axillary fold is the rounded (transversely con- vex) eminence of the coraco-brachialis muscle, and just behind this, in a slight furrow, lies the end of the axillary artery. The lower border of the pectoralis major leaves the chest at the level of the fifth rib, and a little above it is the niiJ^itle. This generally overlies the fourth rib or fourth intercostal space, but in old females is very variable. Measure its distance from the middle line, and note that it is about four inches. A well-developed female breast is seldom seen in the dissecting-room, but in the post-mortem room it will be seen as a flattened cone the circular base of which overlies the pectoralis major for two-thirds of its extent, though the lower and outer third covers the serratus magnus. On the sunmiit of the nipple the minute openings of the lactiferous ducts may just be seen, while surrounding it is a pink or pigmented circular patch, the areola. Durmg pregnancy the pigmenta- tion of the areola and nipple increases. Surrounding the female nipple a ring of nodular areolar glands should be looked for. When the arm is lifted up (abducted) five serrations of the serratus m-agnus are seen in thin muscular subjects rising from the ribs below the border of the pectoralis major. Now push the fingers well up into the axilla and rotate the arm with the other hand, at the same time abducting and adduct- ing it; this should enable the lower part of the head of the humerus to be felt just below the glenoid cavity. Here, perhaps, it will be Avell to clearly understand the various movements of the shoulder joint. When the arm is drawn away from the side the move- ment is called abduction, though at the shoulder joint it is only possible to abduct till the arm forms a right angle with

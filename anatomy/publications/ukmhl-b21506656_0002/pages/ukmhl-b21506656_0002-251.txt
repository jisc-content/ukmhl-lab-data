THE BACK 239 lower angles of the scapulae are on a level with the spine of the seventh thoracic vertebra, while the spine of the scapula is easily localised, starting from its root at the vertebral border and running upwards and outwards to the acromial process. On running the finger along the lower border of the spine, and so along the lower and outer margin of the acromion, about an inch from the tip of the acromion, a fairly definite tubercle is felt, which is known as the metacromial process, and is a very useful point from which to take measurements of the arm. Working the finger round the tip of the acromion the clavicle will be felt, and the acromio-clavicular joint localised by a slight depression. If there is the slightest difficulty in finding this, move the arm freely in any direction and it will become apparent. Nothing can be felt of the shoulder joint from behind, since it is covered by two layers of thick muscle ; its position, however, is about a finger's-breadth internal to the meta- cromial process. In the lower part of the trunk the crest of the ilium must be defined even by the dissector of the upper extremity. In the living body there is usually a dimple in the skin corre- sponding to the posterior superior spine, and from this the crest runs upwards and outwards. A line joining the highest points of the two crests passes through the fourth lumbar spine. Skin incisions.â€”Make one long incision right do^vn the mid dorsal line, in the spinal furrow, from the external occipital protuberance to the sacrum. From the top of this make another at right angles for one inch outwards, along the superior curved line of the occipital bone. From the bottom of it make a curved incision along the crest of the ilium as far as its middle. A fourth incision should be started at the tip of the acromial process, and should run downwards and inwards along the spine of the scapula as far. as its root, and

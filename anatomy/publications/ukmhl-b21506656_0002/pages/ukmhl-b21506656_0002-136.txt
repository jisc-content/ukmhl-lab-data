124 PRACTICAL ANATOMY other and to the duodenum. It is exceptional to find them all present and well developed; it is rare, however, to find no trace of any of them. The para-duodenal fossa is the fossa at the extreme left. In the free edge of the fold of peritoneum which bounds the fossa anteriorly a large vein is often seen; this vein may be either the inferior mesenteric vein itself, or a large tributary passing down to it from the transverse colon, an accessory middle colic vein.

The fossai in the ileo-ccecal region are again three in number, though, Hke the duodeno-jejunal fossse, they are all very inconstant in the adult. In a full-term foetus the ileo- cohc and ileo-C£Bcal fossjB are always well marked; one, the ileo-colic, in front of the angle between the ileum and ascend- ing colon; another, the ileo-ccecal, in the angle between the ileum and CEecum; the third, the retro-coical, behind the ctecum. The fold of peritoneum bounding anteriorly the ileo-coUc fossa contains the anterior ca3cal branch of the

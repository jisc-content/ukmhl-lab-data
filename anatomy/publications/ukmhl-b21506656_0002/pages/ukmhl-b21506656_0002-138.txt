126 PRACTICAL ANATOMY from the splenic flexuve of the colon to the diaphragm oppo- site the eleventh rib; it usually forms a well-marked shelf for the spleen. The second pouch lies in the corresponding position on the right side. It is known as the right kidney pouch, and is bounded above by the liver, below by the hepatic flexure and transverse colon, to the right by the meeting of the liver and hepatic flexure, to the left by the second portion of the duodenum and the gall bladder below and by the foramen of Winslow above (see Fig. 240, F,W.). The pouch is more potential than real with the viscera in situ. Pus not in- frequently collects within it from duodenal, gall bladder, or appendicular trouble, and should this pus not be quickly evacuted, it tends to overflow into the general peritoneal cavity, or' into the small peritoneal sac through the foramen of Winslow. The opening necessary for drainage is made into the fossa through the right flank immediately to the right of the upper half of the right kidney. Before leaving the peritoneum note again the direction of the attachment of the mesentery, and how suppuration in connection with the stomach or gall bladder tends to be guided by the mesentery down to the right ihac fossa (Fig. 240, M.). The Small Intestine Take hold of a loop of the small intestine, and trace it upAvards to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and downwards to the right ihac fossa. The length of the small intestine is about twenty-three feet. Its length is, however, Hable to be materially contracted by the action of forma- lin with which most bodies are now preserved. It is usual to divide it somewhat arbitrarily into an upper two-fifths, jejunum, and a lower three-fifths, ileum. At the present stage the distinctions between the two parts are: (1) the jejunum hes more to the left of the middle line, the ileum more to the right; (2) the jejunum has thicker walls than

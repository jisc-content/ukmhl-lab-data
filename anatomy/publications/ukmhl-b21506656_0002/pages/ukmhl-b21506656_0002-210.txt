198 PRACTICAL ANATOMY anterior common ligament, middle sacral and superior ha3morrhoidal vessels—the pyriformis above, the coccygeus and levator ani beloAv—the lower sacral nerves and sacro- coccygeal plexus, the sympathetic cords, and the ganglion impar. Anteriorly, the base of the bladder, vesicula; seminales, vasa deferentia, prostate with coils of small intestine or of pelvic colon above. Laterally, the internal iliac vessels, with their branches and tributaries, particularly the middle hsemorrhoidal vessels, also the ureter. The Bladder occupies the anterior part of the pelvis. In the dissecting-room subject it is usually of a pyriform shape, the apex in front, the base behind. The lower half of the pear lies in a bed of loose cellular tissue contained in the hammock or trough which the levatores ani muscles make. The ureters enter the bladder wall at the lateral angles, where the sides join the base. It is usual to describe an upper, a lower, two lateral surfaces, and a base or posterior surface. _ Superiorly, the Bladder is covered by peritoneum, and is in relation to coils of small intestine and pelvic colon. Inferiorly it Ues on a bed of cellular tissue, which separates it from the levator ani muscle and symphysis pubis, and is often known as the " cave of Retzius." This is the anterior nart of the inferior surface; more posteriorly it rests on the base of the prostate. When the viscus is distended ils inferior surface comes successively into relation with the svmphysis and anterior abdominal wall. Its base is partially covered by peintoneum, and limits anteriorly the recto-vesical pouch, which separates it from the rectum and pelvic colon. It has in contact with it on either side the vesicula seminalis and vas deferens, iho vasa deferentia, converging as they approach the prostate leave a small triangular space between them the base ot which is above, and is formed by the line of reflexion of the

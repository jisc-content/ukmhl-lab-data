323 THE PALM just below it; consequently, incisions may safely be made between that lino and the fingers. Another guide is to take a horizontal line across the palm from the tip of the out- stretched thumb, though this is a little more cumbrous in practice. Notice most carefully that the superficial palmar arch lies superficial to all the structures in the palm except the central part of the deep palmar fascia, and that the branches of the median nerve lie deep to it, as do also all the tendons to the fingers. In addition to the deep branch which has been seen, there are four digital branches [aa. digitales volares com- munes] given off from the arch. Of these the innermost passes to the ulnar side of the little finger, while the other three run towards the clefts between the four fingers, and each divides about a quarter of an inch before reaching the cleft into two branches for the neighbouring sides of two fingers. Just before its division an anastomosis with the palmar interosseous branches of the deep palmar arch should be looked for in each of these digital arteries. The anasto- mosis will usually be found in the cleft between the index and medius fingers, but is often absent in the other two clefts. A point of great importance is to notice that the arteries near the webs of the fingers lie deeper than the nerves. It is quite a common thing to find them passing through the nerves on their way from the palmar arch to the fingers. The Anterior Annular Ligament [lig. carpi transversum] should now be examined; it is a very strong quadrilateral transverse band attached on the radial side to the tubercle of the scaphoid and to both lips of the groove on the trapezium, while on the ulnar side it is fastened to the pisiform bone and the hook on the unciform. In the living hand it lies deep to that part in which the thenar and hypothenar eminences come nearest to one another.

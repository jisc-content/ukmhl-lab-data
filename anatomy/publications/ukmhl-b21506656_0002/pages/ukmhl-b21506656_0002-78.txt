66 PRACTICAL ANATOMY sheath. White rami come from all the thoracic nerves except the first, and are to be regarded as conveying fibres from the intercostal nerve to the ganglion, while the grey rami run from the ganglion to the nerve. The intercostal nerve traced inward will be seen in the intervertebral fora- men to be the larger of the two divisions into which the spinal nerve divides. The other division—the posterior primary—passes directly backwards close to the side of the arch of the vertebra, and is dissected with the muscles of the back. Traced outwards the intercostal nerve with the corresponding vessels passes behind the internal intercostal muscle t9 gain the interval between that muscle and the external intercostal. The sternum below the 1st costal cartilages with its associated cartilages may now be removed and placed aside for future examination. Articulations of the Thorax Three or four of the middle thoracic vertebrae with the corresponding ribs may now be removed. The piece thus separated should be used for the demonstration of the articulations and Ugaments. Begin by cleaning the hga- mentous structures binding the vertebrae together and the ribs to the vertebrae. The anterior common ligament [lig. longitudinale anterius] consists of fibres passing vertically down in front of the median parts of the bodies of the vertebrae. The intervertebral disc [fibro-cartilago intervertebralis] in section shows a series of concentric rings formed by alter- nate layers of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage. Near the centre of these is the nucleus pulposus, which is very elastic and expands above the level of the rest of the section. If the student now turns to the side of the vertebral column he will see that the ribs are here articulated to the column, each by two articulations, the anterior one (oosto-

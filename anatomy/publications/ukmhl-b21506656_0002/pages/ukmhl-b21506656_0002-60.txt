PRACTICAL ANATOMY 48 In front of the root is the pericardial concavity (Fig. 211 P.), clown which the phrenic nerve runs. Below this the inferior vena cava (I.V.C.) grooves the lung. Above the pericardial area runs the superior vena cava (S.V.C.), while, arching over the root, is a groove for the vena azygos major (V.A.M.), which here keeps the vagus off the lung. Behind the superior caval groove the trachea (T.) is in contact with the lung, the vagus passing obliquely downwards and backwards between the lung and the trachea, while above the trachea the innominate and subclavian arterial groove begins (I.A.). Behind the root is the oesophageal groove (CE.), which may or may not be continued up above the azygos vein, while below, the aorta (Ao.) usually just touches this lung. On the medial surface of the left lung the arch of the aorta makes a wide and definite groove above the root; this is continued down behind the root to the lower margin of the lung (see Fig. 212, Ao.). Here the oesophagus (CE.) reaches the lung in front of the aorta. This explains the clinical fact that malignant disease of the lower end of the oesophagus may invade either of the lungs or pleural sacs. Running upwards from the convexity of the groove for the aortic arch to just in front of the apex of the lung is a groove for the left subclavian artery (S.A.), and in front of that another for the left innominate and subclavian veins (I.v.). The pulmonary artery makes a nearly horizontal groove (P.A.) just below that for the arch of the aorta, and below this again is the concavity for the pericardium. The anterior border of this lung is usually more or, less deeply indented to form the cardiac notch, and for this reason the pericardial area is not so large as it would other- wise be.

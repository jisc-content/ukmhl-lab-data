THE STOMACH 131 Take care, however, to leave the hepatic and splenic flexures as well as a narrow strip of transverse meso-colon connecting them. The Stomach Attention must now be directed to the stomach, which should be, if possible, inflated at this stage. This is best accomplished by passing a long india-rubber tube through the mouth into the stomach and blowing along it from a bellows. The stomach will readily be distended, and will probably retain sufficient air without the apphcation of Hgatures. If, however, the oesophagus has been exposed in the dissection of the thorax, a sHt large enough to receive the nozzle of the bellows may be made in it there. In a body injected with a good deal of formahn, it is hardly worth while trying to inflate the stomach. The stomach wiU now be seen to be of a pyriform shape, the fundus lying above and to the left, the pylorus lying horizontally to the right on the transpyloric line (see p. 79), It is not always easy to see the position of the pylorus, but it may always be felt as a definite thickening if the stomach and duodenum be palpated carefully; it is seldom more than an inch to the right of the mid line. The oesophageal aper- ture lies to the medial side of the fundus, behind a point on the 7th left costal cartilage, an inch from the sternum. The index finger should now be passed from the oesopha- geal aperture to the pyloric aperture along the upper border of the stomach; in this way the small curvature of the stomach will be de'fined, and it will be noted that about two- thirds of the way down it bends much more sharply than elsewhere. The finger should be similarly passed between the two apertures along the lower border defining the great curvature. Notice that along the small curvature the gastro-hepatic omentum is attached, along the great curva- ture the great omentum, and along the fundus the gastro- splenic omentum.

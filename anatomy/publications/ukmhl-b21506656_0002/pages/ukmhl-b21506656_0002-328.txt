PKACTICAL ANATOMY 316 On looking at a radius the thickness of the lower part of the pronator quadratus is explained by noticing that it is inserted into the triangular surface which lies just above the sigmoid cavity for the lower end of the ulna. The Anterior Carpal Artery [ramus carpeus volaris] is a small branch which anastomoses with a corresponding branch of the radial artery to form the anterior carpal arch, which usually lies a little above the level of the wrist joint and always deep to all the flexor tendons. The Posterior Ulnar Carpal [ramus carpeus dorsalis] will be seen winding round to the back of the carpus deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. It will be followed later. THE PALM OF THE HAND Surface Anatomy As in the forearm, the surface markings of the palm are more satisfactorily studied on the student's own hand than on that of the subject. The relations of the soft parts to the surface will be noted as they are exposed. It is, however, important to notice some points of corre- spondence between the skin and the skeleton before beginning the actual dissection. If an articulated carpus is fitted on to the dissector's own hand the pisiform can easily be put in its proper place, since it is so readily felt through the skin; while the tubercle of the scaphoid can be made out, though not so easily, a little below the styloid process of the radius on the outer side. Now the position of the wrist joint is clear, and will be seen to correspond fairly well to the middle one of the three transverse lines made in the skin by flexing the wrist. This may be checked by feeling for the styloid processes of the radius and ulna, remembering that the line of the joint forms an arch with its convexity upwards between these. In

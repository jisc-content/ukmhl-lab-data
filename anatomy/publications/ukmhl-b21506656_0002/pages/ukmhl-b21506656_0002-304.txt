292 PRACTICAL ANATOMY anticus. Some of its fibres may usually be traced into the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The brackialis anticus rises from the lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the humerus, and the deltoid insertion is seen to dovetail into this origin. Trace the muscle upwards on the outer side of the deltoid, and notice that here it is really rising from the lower end of the spiral groove. Externally its origin is so closely blended with that of the brachio-radialis that the two muscles have to be forcibly separated in order to expose the musculo-spiral nerve Avhich lies between them. The brachialis anticus forms a thick fleshy mass in front of the elbow joint, and here is remarkable for its vertically striped appearance caused by alternate streaks of flesh and tendom If, in tying the brachial artery at the elboAv, this appearance is seen, it shows the operator that he has reached too deep a level. The insertion into the front of the coronoid process of the ulna cannot very well be made out now, but it is quite obvious that the muscle can only act as a flexor of the elbow joint, since flexion and extension are the only movements allowed between the humerus and ulna. While the brachialis anticus is being examined will be a good time to clean and follow the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Pick it up as it comes out of the outer side of the coraco- brachialis, and notice that it is now lying deep to the biceps and superficial to the brachialis anticus. Here it gives off motor twigs to both heads of the biceps, and usually two to the brachialis anticus, from one of which the chief articular nerve to the elbow is derived. It now has nothing but cutaneous fibres left, and as soon as it reaches the outer side of the tendon of the biceps, it pierces the fascia and becomes superficial. Sometimes a communication with the median is found deep to the biceps.

247 THE PECTORAL REGION cut t hrough and reHecled, because a few of the suporticial fibres often reach the vertebral border in its whole extent. In reflecting the muscle define the termination of the nerve to the rhomboids, the greater part of which enters the muscle close to its upper border. It will be noticed that the fibrous arch is much more strongly attached below, and the part it plays is rather a neat little bit of mechanism for concentrating the action of a broad flat muscle on one point; because, since the fibres of the rhomboideus major run downwards as well as outwards, they pull much more strongly on the lower attachment of the arch, and so make the muscle act on the lower angle of the scapula where there is most leverage. Now replace all the divided muscles, none of which has been damaged, and if it has not already been done, the student is strongly advised to sketch the first and second layers separately, putting in the arteries and. nerves in colour. Notice that the only parts of the second layer which are not concealed by the first are the upper part of the levator anguli scapulse, which is in the neck and does not concern us here, and the lower angle of the rhom- boideus major. The whole of this dissection should not take more than two days, and for the next two or three days the body must be left to the other dissectors. The interval may be well spent in learning and drawing the bones of the upper extremity. THE PECTORAL REGION Superficial Landmarks Notice the suprasternal notch, above the manubrium, between the inner ends of the two clavicles, and then run the finger down the mid line until the junction between the pre- and meso-sternum (manubrium and gladiolus) is reached. This is easily felt as a definite transverse ridge, and corre-

16 PRACTICAL ANATOMY part of the auricular portion ; they are the pulmonary veins, and are usually two on each side. A distinct recess is situated between the pulmonary veins of either side; it is termed the sinus obliquus 'pericardii, and should be explored by the finger; it is closed above. Lying in front of the auricles are two large trunks passing upwards from the right and left ventricles; they are the pulmonary artery [A. pulmonalis], and the ascending aorta [A. ascendens]. The former, which is the more superficial, passes upwards and to the left, the latter upwards and to the right. These two large vessels will be seen to lie within the concavity of the crescent-shaped auricular portion, the two horns of which project forwards as ear-shaped appendages, the right and left auricular appendices. If the pulmonary artery and the aorta be now taken together between the fingers and thumb, it will be found that they can be lifted up, and a finger may be hooked behind them lying in a transverse passage known as the sinus transversus peri- cardii. This sinus opens at either end into the general pericardial cavity (see Fig. 195). Its presence is attributable to the fact that the two vessels are surrounded by a common tube of serous pericardium. Note that the posterior Avail of the sinus transversus is formed by the two auricles. THE HEART The right and left borders of the ventricular portion of the heart are in marked contrast, the former being sharp and horizontal—the margo acutiis—the latter rounded and oblique—the margo ohtusus. They meet at the apex of the heart. Along the right border particularly there is usually to be seen an accumulation of subserous fat (see Fig. 192, F.Pm.). In studying the relationships obtaining between the different portions of t'hc heart, it is of advantage to note that the long axis of the heart from base to apex is obliquely downwards, forwards, and to the left, in consequence of which

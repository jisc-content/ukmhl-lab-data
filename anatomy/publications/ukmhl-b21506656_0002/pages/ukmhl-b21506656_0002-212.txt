200 PRACTICAL ANATOMY peritoneum. In this triangle the wall of the rectum and bladder are in contact, and here the bladder used to be punctured, through the rectum, with a long curved trochar and canula. To the apex of the bladder is attached the vyrachus, Fig. 273.â€”The Posterior Surface or Base of the Bladder. U. Ureter. V.D. Vas Deferens. A. Ampulla of Vas Deferens. V.S. Vesicula Seminalis. P. Line of Reflexion of Peritoneum on to the Rectum. R-A. Triangle uncovered by Peritoneum in contact with the Rectal Ampulla. Pr. Prostate. a fibrous cord running upwards to the umbilicus, and representing the remains of the allantois. Traced downwards, the surfaces of the bladder converge to form an ill-defined neck, which at the base of the prostate opens into the urethra. Laterally, the bladder is in relation to the side-walls of the pelvis, from which, however, it is separated by cellular tissue containing branches of the internal iliac vessels.

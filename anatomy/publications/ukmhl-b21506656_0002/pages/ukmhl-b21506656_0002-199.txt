187 LUMBAR PLEXUS The Iliacus arises from the iUac fossa, the ala of the sacrum, and from the strong ligamentous fibres which bind the sacrum, ilium, and 5th lumbar vertebra together. Transversalis Muscle.â€”To the outer side of the quadratus lumborum the fibres of the transversaHs muscle will be seen passing outwards. This muscle has already been examined from the back. It may, however, be noted here that many of its fibres are directly continuous with those of the fascia in front of the quadratus lumborum, already referred to as the anterior lamella of the lumbar aponeurosis [fascia lumbo- dorsalis], which is attached to the front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrtB a little internal to their tips. The transversalis muscle is pierced an inch or two from the lateral border of the quadratus lumborum by the last thoracic, the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves. Lumbar Plexus, Arteries, and Ligaments The student should now trace on one side the various nerves which have been found already on the posterior abdominal wall to their origin from the lumbar plexus. In doing this the psoas muscle will be necessarily removed, while every care should be taken to preserve the rami communi- cantes between the sympathetic cord and the spinal nerves. The psoas must be cut away piecemeal as the various nerves are traced to the plexus. Begin by tracing the ilio-hypo- gastric and ilio-inguinal nerves inwards, when they will be seen to arise from the 1st lumbar nerve. The genito-crural nerve will be seen to come from the 1st and 2nd, the external cutaneous nerve from the 2nd and 3rd lumbar nerves. The anterior crural and the obturator both spring from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nerves, while the remaining portion of the 4th turns down to join the 5th nerve, and so forms the lumbo- sacral cord. The accessory obturator nerve when present may be traced to the 3rd and 4th lumbar nerves between the obturator nerve in front and the anterior crural behind. It

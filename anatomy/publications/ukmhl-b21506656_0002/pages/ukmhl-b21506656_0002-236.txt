224 PRACTICAL ANATOMY cavity of the pelvis, and the various structures already identified can be more completely exposed and studied. Arteries of the Intrapelvic Female Generative Organs.â€”This is a convenient stage to examine the uterine and vaginal arteries. The uterine artery rises from the hypogastric or internal iliac artery close to or in common with the vesical and middle hsemorrhoidal arteries, after which it runs downwards and inwards through the pelvic cellular tissue and uterine plexus of veins {parametrium) to the cervix uteri, passing just above and in front of the ureter. Here it gives off a cervical branch, but the main artery runs a very tortuous course along the side of the body of the uterus between the folds of the broad ligament, in which it will be followed later (see Fig. 285). The Vaginal Artery usually replaces the inferior vesical of the male and runs in the cellular tissue to the vagina, where it breaks up into numerous anterior and posterior branches, which again anastomose to form a very tortuous median branch running longitudinally in front and behind the vagina. Both these arteries are accompanied by a plexus of veins. Examination of the Female Pelvic Viscera The viscera may now be removed and examined in detail, the peritoneum still adherent to them on the left side. The pelvic colon, rectum, and anal canal behind, and the bladder in front, are similar in all respects in the two sexes, and the student is referred to the description of these parts already given. The genital organs require, of course, special observation. Remove in one piece the uterus. Fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina, bladder, and urethra. The last two structures are included because it will be found that the urethra is closely

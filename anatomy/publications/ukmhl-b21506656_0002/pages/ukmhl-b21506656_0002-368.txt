It is also one of the particular kinds of diarthrodial joints known as ball and socket or enarthrodial, so that its full description is an enarthrodial diarthrosis. Open the joint from behind, and notice the tendon of the biceps, surrounded by synovial membrane, lying free in the joint cavity. Notice, too, the glenoid lip or ligament [labrum glenoidale], a rim of

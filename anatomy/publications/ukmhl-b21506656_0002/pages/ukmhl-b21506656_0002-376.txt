364 PRACTICAL ANATOMY to display properly, since the intervals between any two adjacent ligaments is filled up with less dense fibrous tissue; it would therefore be quite a satisfactory and practical thing to think of all the intercarpal joints as having a continuous palmar and dorsal capsule, blending with the periosteum of the bones, and strengthened in various places by special palmar and dorsal bands. On the palmar side these bands form a star radiating from the os magnum [lig. carpi radiatum], while on the dorsum they are less regular, but there is one special band passing from the scaphoid to the cuneiform behind the head of the OS magnum; this is known as the dorsal transverse ligament of the carpus, and prevents the head of the os magnum starting back. To find the interosseous ligaments the joints must be opened, but before this is done, notice how the various carpal bones glide on one another in different movements of the hand, and how the transverse carpal joint between the proximal and distal row of carpal bones reinforces the move- ments of the wrist joint. It will be found to allow rather more extension than the wrist does, but rather less flexion. The wrist, it will be remembered, allows more flexion than extension. Very little abduction or adduction is obtained at the transverse carpal joint, but there is a certain amount. Some authors neglect this and call the jomt a hinge; others think it worthy of notice, in which case the joint is condyloid. ... â€¢ r ^ a Now open the transverse carpal joint from m front, and notice its sinuous line like an S laid on its back, thus, ^ '^'he interosseous carpal ligaments should now be looked for by separating the various bones gently. There are none between the bones of the proximal and distal rows; the two joining the bones of the proximal row are complete, and have already been seen from the wrist, while the four bones of the

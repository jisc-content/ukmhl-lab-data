305 THE FOKEARM is practically the same as that of the flexor carpi radialis, though its fleshy belly is not so well marked, while its tendon is very long and delicate. This muscle is often absent, and, like all disappearing structures, liable to considerable variations. The posterior or deep relations of the radial artery in the forearm are:— Bones.—The lower end of the radius. Miiscles.—Tendon of biceps, supinator brevis, insertion of pronator radii teres, radial head of flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, pronator quadratus. Other Structures.—None. The Tendon of the biceps should now be followed to its insertion into the back part of the tubercle of the radius. Notice that in the radius the tubercle is the point of greatest inward convexity of the bone, so that this powerful supinator acts at a mechanical advantage by attaching itself here, just as the pronator teres does by being inserted into the greatest outward convexity. A further and better chance of observ- ing this insertion will come when the bones are cleared for the dissection of the joints. The supinator brevis is at present so much hidden by the brachio-radialis and extensor tendons that its study is best deferred until these are removed. The/ exor sublimis digitorum lies on a deeper plane than the other superficial flexors, so that, in order to get a good view of it, the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus should be cut through about the middle of their fleshy bellies and their two ends reflected. It will now be possible to trace the origin of the muscle (1) from the common flexor tendon rising from the internal condyle; (2) from the intermuscular septa between it and the other superficial flexor muscles; (3) from the deep fascia overlying it, though this, on account of its comparative depth, IS only a slight origin; (4) from the internal lateral ligament of the elbow joint, which conducts it to (5) the sublime tubercle on the inner side of the coronoid process

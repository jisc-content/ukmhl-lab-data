123 PERITONEAL FOSSiE posteriorly. Occasionally, however, a portion of the posterior surface is left uncovered ; how much is so left can be demon- strated by passing the hand upwards behind the ctecum and noting the relationship between the line of peritoneal reflexion and the ilio-cajcal junction. The ascending coloia, descending colon, and iliac colon are covered by peritoneum, as a rule, anteriorly and laterally only. The pelvic colon, hke the small intestine, is covered by peritoneum everywhere except along a linear area posteriorly. The attachment of the pelvic meso-colon to the abdominal wall often passes first upwards from the inner border of the psoas to the promontory, and then downwards in the middle line to the 3rd sacral vertebra (see Fig. 240, P.M.C.). It may be here remarked that a portion of large intestine in a collapsed state might possess a meso-colon, while the same portion in a distended state, in consequence of the separation of its lateral walls, might show no trace of a meso-colon. Peritoneal FossiE It is now necessary to consider certain fossEe in which knuckles of intestine may be caught and strangulated. The lesser sac has been already mentioned, and has been stated to he behind the stomach and to pass down in the great omentum in front of the transverse colon. Its opening^ the foramen of Winslow, has also been examined. The remain- ing peritoneal hssse are found in three regions : (1) near the duodeno-jejunal flexure ; (2) near the ileo-ceecal junction; (3) in connection with the pelvic meso-colon. In order to find the fossae of the first group, the great omentum and transverse colon must be turned up, and^then the whole of the small intestines drawn over to the rio-ht. The duodeno-jejunal fossce may be three in number They all he to the left of the terminal portion of the duo- denum ; they are known as superior and inferior duodeno- jejunal and para-duodenal from their relationship to each

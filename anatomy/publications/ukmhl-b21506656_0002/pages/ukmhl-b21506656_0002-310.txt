298 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve ahouid be looked for in the lower part of the exposed area in the interval between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus, the two tendons which stand out so pro- minently in the hving forearm just above the wrist when that joint is forcibly flexed. The palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve is smaller than that of the median and pierces the deep fascia a little above and external to the pisiform bone, which is so easily felt through the skin on the inner side of the front of the wrist. The superficial veins of the front of the forearm are the radial, the median, and the anterior ulnar. The radial vein winds round the outer side of the forearm from the back of the wrist, while the median and uhmr veins begin in a plexus in front of the wrist. The course of these superficial .veins is easily seen in the living forearm, while in the dissection it will be noticed that they lie super- ficial to the nerve trunks and are only crossed by very small cutaneous nerve twigs. Now remove the deep fascia of the forearm, begmnmg from below. As the upper part is approached it will be more and more difficult to remove, because the underlymg muscles rise from it, and where its removal tears these muscles it had better be left untouched. Identify the superficial muscles of the forearm, beginnmg with the brachio-radialis on the outer side, rising from the external supra-condylar ridge, and then, in their order from without inwards, the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radiahs, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum and flexor carpi ulnaris. All these last five rise, in part at least, from the internal condyle, and their fleshy beUies cause the rounded thickening of the upper half of the forearm. In its lower half, where they become tendinous, the fore- arm is a good deal more slender. Bear in mind that the palmaris longus is an inconstant muscle and is often wanting.

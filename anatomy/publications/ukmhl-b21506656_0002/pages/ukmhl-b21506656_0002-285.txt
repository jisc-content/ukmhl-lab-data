THE SHOULDER 273 intermediate triangular with its apex forwards, while the lower is triangular with its apex backwards. Now divide the muscle and remove the limb. THE REGION OF THE SHOULDER Carry the vertical incision already made on the outer side of the shoulder down as far as the insertion of the deltoid, that is, to about the middle of the arm. Remember that anatomically the arm is the region between the shoulder and elbow joints. Reflect the skin downwards all round as far as this level, looking out carefully for cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve, supplying the skin superficial to the lower half of the deltoid, as well as for twigs of the supra-acromial nerve supplying the area superficial to the upper half of the muscle. Most of the circumflex cutaneous branches wind round the posterior border of the deltoid and should be picked up here, but a few pierce the muscle farther forward. Be careful, too, of the cephalic vein running along the anterior border of the deltoid, between it and the pectoralis major. A little below the circumflex branches, between the inner border of the triceps and the posterior axillary fold, the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve should be sought; this supplies the greater part of the back of the arm. Clean the deltoid muscle, and notice the arrangement of its fibres; those near the anterior and posterior borders are long and linear, but the middle ones are bipenniform, rising from and being inserted into vertical fibrous plates, which lie at right angles to the surface of the muscle. Make out the origin of the muscle from the anterior border of the outer third of the clavicle, from the external and posterior borders of the acromion, and from the lower border of the spine of the scapula, as well as its insertion into the VOL.

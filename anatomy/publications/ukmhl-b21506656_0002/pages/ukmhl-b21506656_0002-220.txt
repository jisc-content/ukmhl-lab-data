208 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The Ohtwrator Artery rises from the hypogastric loop behind the branches already mentioned, and runs forwards to the obturator foramen below the obturator nerve. It is very variable in size, and sometimes is a branch of the deep epigastric (see Fig. 276, Obt^ A.). The Internal Pudic [a. pudenda interna] and Sciatic Arteries rise by a common trunk from the hypogastric behind the origin of the obturator. They separate from one another near the lower border of the pyriformis muscle, and leave the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic notch below this muscle, the internal pudic being in front and the sciatic behind. The common trunk Avhich these arteries form is usually described as the continuation of the anterior division of the internal iliac. The Posterior Division of the Internal Iliac Artery is originally a branch of the hypogastric which rises behind the common origin of the sciatic and internal pudic, and leaves the pelvis as the gluteal artery above the upper border of the pyriformis muscle. It passes between two nerves, which will later be recognised as the lumbo-sacral cord and the first sacral nerve. This posterior division soon gives off the Ilio-lumhar Artery, which runs upwards and outwards between the obturator nerve and the lumbo-sacral cord to disappear deep to the psoas muscle (see Fig. 275, p. 204). On one side the psoas and iliacus muscles may be cleared away far enough to follow this branch, care being taken not to cut any nerves met with. When this is done the artery will be found to divide into an iliac branch, which supplies the iliac fossa, and a lumbar branch, which passes upwards and backwards be- tween the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum to supply the lower part of the spinal canal. The resemblance of this lumbar branch to the posterior branch of a typical lumbar or intercostal artery will be evident. The Lateral Sacral Arteries, usually two on each side, run

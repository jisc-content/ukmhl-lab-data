PRACTICAL ANATOMY 284 That swelling in the upper part of the arm which is nearest the axilla is the long head. The external head has very short, fleshy fibres, and lies below the lower half of the posterior border of the deltoid. If the living arm is extended and rotated inwards, the oblique, roll-like swelling of this head will be readily felt. It is an important landmark, because the musculo-spiral nerve lies deep to it and nearly corresponds to its long axis. The bony points at the back of the elbow are very im- portant in diagnosing between fractures and dislocations. The two condyles are easily felt from behind, and if a line is drawn between them it will just touch the top of the olecranon process of the ulna when the elbow is extended. The head of the radius is most easily felt immediately below the back of the external condyle, though while it is being felt for, the forearm should be continuously pronated and supinated. A bursa lies between the olecranon and the skin. The elbow joint too is easily felt just above the head of the radius, between it and the capitellum of the humerus. Between the internal condyle and the olecranon passes the ulnar nerve, which is here specially liable to injury, and is popularly known as the " funny bone." Skin Incisions.â€”Make a vertical incision down the front of the arm from the place whence the skin has already been reflected to a point an inch below the bend of the elbow. Here make a transverse incision at right angles to the rbrmer and reflect the two flaps. The superficial structures are those lying between the skm and the deep fascia, which m the arm and forearm really does form a sleeve-like sheath of membrane, though of course this merges insensibly into the cellular tissue, packing up all the interstices between the muscles on its deep sxirface as well as with the fat-containing superficial fascia between it and the skin. The superficial veins (see Fig. 300) form a free communi-

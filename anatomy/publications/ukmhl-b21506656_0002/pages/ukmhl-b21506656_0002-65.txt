THE MEDIASTINA 53 which it furnishes fine twigs. The right phrenic breaks up and pierces the dome of the diaphragm, a few filaments pass- ing with the inferior vena cava through its aperture. Put in another way, the right phrenic nerve is found on the right side of both the superior and inferior venae cavÂ£e; between the two it Hes to the right of the right auricle, the pericardium intervening (see Figs. 207, 215, R.Ph.N.). The right vagus [n. vagus] having entered the thorax Hes close to the right side of the trachea, running obliquely backwards as it descends. It then passes behind the root of the lung, where it has already been seen forming the posterior pulmonary plexus (see Figs. 207, 214, and 215, R.V.jST.). From here it is traceable to the plexus guise, lying chiefly behind the oesophagus, with which it leaves the thorax through the oesophageal aperture of the diaphragm. Now examine the nerves on the left side. The left phrenic and left vagtts have been seen already crossing in front of the arch of the aorta, and from this point they may be followed in both directions (see Fig. 215, L.P.N, and L.V.N.). Above the arch they are soon lost behind the innominate vein, but if this structure is reflected they may be followed up into the neck. At the lower level of the arch of the aorta the superior mediastinum ends, and below this the phrenic lies in the middle mediastinum, cross- ing in front of the root of the lung, and being pushed to the left by the pericardium. It pierces the diaphragm after breaking up into branches. Notice that it has a longer course than the right nerve, partly because the diaphragm is lower on the left side and partly because of its wandering to the left behind the pericardium (see Fig. 207). As the left vagus lies in front of the aortic arch, it gives off the left recurrent laryngeal nerve [N. recurrens] (Fig. 209, L.R.L.N.), which is soon lost to view as it curves back be- tween the arch and the pulmonary artery.

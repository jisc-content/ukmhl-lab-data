45 THE LUNGS dorsal is very thick and rounded, so that the greater mass of hang- tissue is situated in the postero-lateral part of the thorax. Notice that the right huig is shorter from base to apex than the left, since the diaphragm ascends higher on the right side, but as the heart is more on the left side of the thorax, it is wider from side to side and capable of containing more air. In this lung there are three lobes separated by two fissures. The primary fissure [incisura interlobaris] begins at the top of the root (see Fig. 211), about the level of the fifth rib, and may be traced round the convex surface in a downward and forward direction till it reaches the base about the eighth rib ; it then runs across the base and turns up on the pericardial aspect to reach the lower part of the root. The secondary fissv/re begins behind, about the middle of the primary, and runs almost horizontally forwards. Inter- nally it will be seen to reach the most anterior part of the root. In the left lung there are only two lobes and one fissure ; this corresponds to the primary fissure of the right lung, save that it ascends rather higher after leaving the top of the root, and runs farther forward at the base. Look at the divided structures at the root of the lung ; they have been identified already, but it will now be seen that the cut reflexion of the pleura at the root has a some- what racket-shaped outline, the handle of the racket being below, formed by the ligamentum latum pulmonis. Close to this ligament is always found the lowest pul- monary vein, while the other one is farther forward. Notice how little difference there is between the thickness of the coats of the artery and vein. The bronchi are easily distinguishable by their rings, and the eparterial bronchus must be carefully looked for on the right side, above the level of the pulmonary artery. The medial relations of the right lung should be studied next.

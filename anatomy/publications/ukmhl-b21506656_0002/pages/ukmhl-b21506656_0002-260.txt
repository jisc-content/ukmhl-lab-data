248 PR/VCTICAL ANATOMY spouds to the junction of the two second ribs with the sternum. On reaching the lower end of the ineso-sternura (gladiolus) the meta-sternum or ensiforui cartilage is felt on a deeper plane between the sternal ends of the seventh costal cartilages. Now feel the clavicle along its whole length, first with the index finger and then with the finger and- thumb, and compare it with a dry bone of the same side. Notice how much the inner end projects above the sternum; then trace the forward convexity of its inner and the forward concavity of its outer part. Place the arm comfortably by the side, and notice that the bone is nearly if not quite horizontal. Push the shoulder up and down, and see the range of movement of the clavicle, and what a difference the position of the bone will make to the relations of the soft structures behind it.. Feel the pectoralis major rising from its inner half and the deltoid rising from its outer third, leavingr a little triangle with its apex downwards between them. This is the infraclavicular triangle or fossa, and just behind its outer edge, that is to say, behind the inner edge of the deltoid, one inch below the junction of.the middle and outer thirds of the clavicle, the tip of the coracoid process will be felt on deep pressure. Look at the dry scapula, and notice that the tip of this process lies just internal to the upper part of the shoulder joint. In a thin subject the lesser tuberosity of the humerus may be felt easily enough external to the tip of the coracoid process. On slightly rotating the arm it will move, while the coracoid is steady. The great tuberosity is responsible for the outward con- vexity of the deltoid. When the shoulder is dislocated and the tuberosity no longer in its proper place, the flattening of the deltoid is quite characteristic. The lower border of the pectoralis major is easily felt and seen, especially if the arm be abducted ; it forms the rounded

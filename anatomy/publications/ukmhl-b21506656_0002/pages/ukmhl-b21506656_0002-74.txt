It is here that the duct was picked up through an incision iii the pleura made just behind the subclavian artery. To the right is the trachea, and in some cases the right pleura (see Fig. 215).

The viscera may now be removed, but in doing so the opportunity should be taken of revising the knowledge previously obtained re- garding the relations of the various parts. It may also now be easier to trace certain of the branches of the vessels and nerves to their destination.

289 THE ARM The 'posterior relations of the brachial artery are :— Bones.—The humerus, as has been seen, is never a direct relation, but is near enough to allow the artery to be com- pressed against it. Muscles.—The long and inner heads of the triceps, the coraco-brachialis, and the brachialis-aniicus. Fibrosis Structures.—None. Arteries.—Superior profunda. Veins.—Superior profunda venie comites. Nerves.—Musculo-spiral. Glandular and other Structures.—None. The Triceps muscle has, as its name implies, three heads. The long head rises from the axillary border of the scapula, just below the glenoid cavity. The outer head rises by a nearly vertical linear origin from the posterior surface of the humerus above the spiral groove. The inner head rises from the posterior surface of the humerus below and internal to the spiral groove, and its origin reaches right down to the back of the external condyle. Here the Anconeus, really a part of the triceps continues the origin and runs across to the outer side of the olecranon process. The insertion of the triceps is into, the back part of the upper surface of the olecranal process of the ulna. The musculo-spiral nerve [n. radialis] lies at first between the brachial artery in front and the long head of the triceps behind, accompanied by the superior profunda artery. Cut the long head of the triceps and turn it down, looking care- fully for the twig supplying it; then trace the nerve to the spu-al groove of the humerus between the outer and inner heads of the triceps. Once in the groove the nerve is covered by the outer head of the triceps, and this should now be divided by an incision passing obliquely downwards and outwards at right angles to the short fleshy fibres of this head. Close to the branch supplying the long head of the triceps will be found the origin of the internal cutaneous VOIj, II, T

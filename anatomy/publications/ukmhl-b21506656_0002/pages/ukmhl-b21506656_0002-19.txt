7 THE THORAX root of the organ is felt, it will be found that a thin fold of plpura {ligamentum latum) descends from the lower aspect of the root, binding the medial surface of the lung to the parietal pleura covering the lateral wall of the pericardium.

Three narrow cleft-hke spaces in connection with the pleura should be now explored—the pericardio-phrenic, the pericardio-sternal, and the costo-phrenic. Their names suffi- ciently indicate their positions. The first lies between the

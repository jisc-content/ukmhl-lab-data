THE MALE PELVIS 195 cord and the ovary as an almond-shaped body. Pressure from above should again be applied. On the anterior wall of the vagina in the middle line the urethra can sometimes be felt as a soft, rounded cord, leading upwards to the bladder and downwards to the external urinary meatus. Dissection of the Male Pelvis These facts having been ascertained, the structures underlying the peritoneum should now be exposed. Make a median incision through the peritoneum from the gut behind to the symphysis pubis in front, and strip the perito- neum from the whole of the right side of the pelvis. The peritoneum above should be removed, and with care it may be reflected as a comparatively complete membrane, although it is firmly adherent to the gut behind and the bladder in front. The other half of the peritoneum should be left intact for purpose of reference. The cellular tissue now exposed by the removal of the peritoneum should be carefully dissected away, while pre- serving all vessels and nerves. Begin by cleaning, so far as it is possible, the pelvic colon and rectum as low down as the levator ani. This portion is supplied by the superior hce- morrhoidal artery, the continuation of the inferior mesen- teric artery into the pelvis, and by the middle hsemorrhoidal artery, a branch of the internal iliac. The nerves come from the sympathetic system and accompany the vessels. Next take the Vas Deferens. In cleaning this tube the dissector need have little fear of injuring any other structure, since the vas lies on the peritoneal side of everything which it crosses. At the internal abdominal ring it will be found to loop over the deep epigastric artery; after which it runs almost directly backwards, towards the region of the spine of the ischium. In this course notice that it crosses internal to (1) the external iliac artery; (2) the external iliac vein,

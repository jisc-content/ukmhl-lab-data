PRACTICAL ANATOMY 324 Superficial to it the following structures have been seen:— Mtisdes.—Ong'm of thenar and hypothenar muscles—pal- maris longus, palmaris brevis. Fibrous Structures.—Falmaris longus tendon, beginning to spread out into deep palmar fascia. Arteries.—Ulnar. Veins.—JJlnai' venjB comites and superficial veins from the palm to the plexus in front of the wrist. Nerves.—Ulnar nerve and pulmiir cutaneous branch of Median. Now cut the ligament carefully so that the structures deep to it are not injured, and it will be seen at once that it acts as a very important strap to keep the tendons of the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus digitorum, the flexor longus pollicis, and the flexor carpi radialis from starting out of their places whenever the wrist is flexed. In addition to these tendons the median nerve passes deep to the anterior annular ligament still lying on the outer side of the flexor sublimis digitorum tendons. The Synovial Sheaths of the Palm.—As they are passing deep to the anterior annular ligament, notice that the tendons are S-irrounded and packed in by a quantity of lax connective tissue. Between this and the tendons a synovial or bursal sheath is established by their constant movement, and this is of great importance surgically, since it is liable to inflame or even suppurate. Make a single small puncture through it till one of the tendons of the flexor sublimis is reached; then insert a blowpipe with its wire in place, and Avithdraw the wire, after which the sheath may be inflated with the mouth, or by bellows, or a bicycle pump attached to the blowpipe by a piece of rubber tubing. When the sheath is blown up it will usually be found to enclose both the flexor sublimis and profundus tendons, and in some few cases the flexor longus pollicis too, though the latter muscle has more often a sheath of its own. The large common sheath of the finger tendons extends above the

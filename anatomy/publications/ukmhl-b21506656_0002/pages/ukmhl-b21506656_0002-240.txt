228 PRACTICAL ANATOMY inch iu length, and lies very close to the anterior wall of the vagina. Make a median incision through the inferior wall of the bladder, beginning at the apex or urachus, and continue the incision along the anterior wall of the urethra. On turning the lips of the incision aside a good view of the interior of the bladder and urethra will be obtained. The mucous membrane of the bladder presents the same features in the two sexes; that of the urethra in the female is thrown into a number of longitudinal folds, Avhich account for its great dilatability. Numerous small mucous glands (glands of Littre) open into it. Now carry the longitudinal incision through the posterior wall of the urethra and anterior wall of the vagina, thus allowing the intra-vaginal part of the cervix and os uteri to be examined more fully. In a multiparous uterus the os externum is often very large, Avith thick patulous lips, which are sometunes scarred or puckered, though in old females the orifice often contracts again to the clean-cut transverse sht noticed already in the nuUiparous uterus. It is therefore not always possible to tell by the appearance of the os whether a female has borne children or no. A circular os is occasionally met with, but it is abnormal and is usually associated with dysmenorrhcea or pamful menstruation. Lay open the uterus by a longitudinal incision from in front, having first passed a probe or seeker into its interior. Draw apart the cut edges, and notice that the cavity is divided into two parts, the body above and the cervix below. The anterior and posterior walls are in contact, so that the cavity is only a potential one. The lower part or cervical canal is fusiform and is slightly constricted where it joins the cavity of the body, forming the OS internum. Its mucous membrane in the nulhpara is thrown into a series of folds which resemble a cypress twig,

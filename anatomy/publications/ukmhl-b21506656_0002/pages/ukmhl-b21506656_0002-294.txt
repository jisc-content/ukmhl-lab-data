282 PRACTICAL ANATOMY As the bend of the elbow is approached, the two sulci turn towards one another, owing to the biceps narrowing into its tendon. This, in the living body, is a very prominent land- mark when the forearm is slightly flexed, and it can be gripped between the finger and thumb, even through the coat- sleeve. I Close to its outer side is the spot at which the musculo- cutaneous nerve becomes superficial, while on its inner side lies the lower end of the brachial artery and, more internally still, the median nerve. Both of these are covered by the bicipital fascia, the upper edge of which can be felt readily. The superficial veins in front of the elbow can be easily demonstrated in the living body, especially if the arm is allowed to hang down; they are very variable, and usually differ on opposite sides of the same body. The two condyles of the humerus are easily felt, though the inner one is much more prominent. The outer condyle is concealed in front by the swelling of the brachio-radialis and extensor carpi radialis muscles, which account for the full and graceful curve of the upper and outer part of the forearm. Above each condyle the supracondylar ridge may be felt, the outer being the more evident and being crossed from behind forwards by the musculo-spiral nerve about two inches above the external condyle. Deep pressure on the ridge about this point in a living person will soon satisfy him as to the exact position of the nerve. Neither the upper end of the radius nor that of the ulna can be felt from the front of the elbow. They are both too thickly covered with muscle. It should be carefully noticed that a good deal of the triceps is visible from the front of the arm; all the mass which is seen on the inner side of the internal bicipital sulcus is formed by the long head of this muscle above and the inner head below. On the back of the arm all three heads of the triceps may be made out.

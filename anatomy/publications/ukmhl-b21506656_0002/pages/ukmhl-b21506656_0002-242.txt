230 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the first pregnancy, and so is of considerable medico-legal importance. Sometimes small cysts, caused by blocked glandular ducts [glandular cervicales], are found in the cervix and are known as ovula Nahothi. The cavity of the uterine body is triangular with its apex below at the os internum; in the multiparous uterus it is rather longer than the cervical canal, though in nullipara the two are nearly of the same length. At the two upper angles the Fallopian tubes open, their orifices being known as the ostia uterina. In order to see one of these the Fallopian tube should be cut across close to the uterus and a bristle or very fine wire pushed along it; now cut a^vay the anterior wall of the uterus until the ostium appears. Owing to its small size it is very difficult to find without the aid of a bristle, t Cut across the Fallopian tube again at its broadest part, and notice that the lumen is stellate because the mucous membrane is thrown into a series of longitudinal folds. Now review the broad ligament once more on the left side; stretch it out, and notice that the Fallopian tube is the highest structure between its two layers. That part of the broad ligament which lies just below the tube is known as the meso-salpynx. The ovary projects backward and has its own reflexion of the broad ligament, called the mesovarium, while in front and below is the round ligauient. The Nerves of the Pelvis The best time to dissect the sacral plexus is after one side of the pelvis has been removed in order to gain enough room and light. To do this with as little injury to the joints as possible, saw through the body of the pubis on one side about half an inch from the symphysis. On the same side saw through the ilium, from the crest

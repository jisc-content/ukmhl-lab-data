THE PELVIC VISCERA 213 If the lips of the incision be now drawn apart, a good view will be obtained of the interior of the bladder and prostatic urethra. The mucous membrane lining the bladder is rugose everywhere, except over a triangular area on the posterior wall, just above the internal wrinary meatus, the entrance into the urethra. This area is known as the trigonum vesicce, and is clearly circumscribed. The base of the Fig. 280.—The Bladder opened from above. Ur. Ureter. Trig. Trigonum Vesicfe. l.U.B. Interureteric Bar. F. Uvula Vesicpe. I.U.M. Internal Urinary Meatus triangle is above, the apex at the meatus. At the basal angles of either side a slit-like aperture will be seen—the opening of the ureter. The rugosity of the remainder of the mucous membrane is attributable to varying distension which the bladder undergoes (see Fig. 280). It will be seen that the two openings of the ureters are about an inch apart, while the openings of the ureters into the exterior of the bladder are two inches apart; it is there-

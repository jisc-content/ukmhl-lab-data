96 PRACTICAL ANATOMY delicate tubules may be seen passing from the testis to the globus major; these are the vasa efferentia [ductu'' eft'erentes testis], and as they approach the epididymis they become coiled into little cones known as the coni vasculosi. At the point where the globus major overhangs the front of the testis, look for the sessile and pedunculated hydaiids of Morgagni, small pyriform vesicles which, however, are not always present. Now tease out the epididymis under water, and try to make out that its structure is a long, delicate, convoluted tube some twenty feet in length. Â» The Spermatic Cord Examine carefully, if possible with a magnifying glass the section of the cord made when one of the testes was removed, or, if necessary, cut a new section a little further down. First look for the vas deferens [ductus deferens] or duct of the testis, which is easily recognised at the back of the cord by its whipcord-like feeling; this is so evident that the vas may be readily isolated from the other constituents of the cord through the scrotum in the living body, and is due to the very thick muscular walls and fine lumen of the duct (see Fig. 232). In front of the vas several thin-walled veins forming the pampiniform plexus are seen; they are of considerable clinical importance, because, owing to the loose tissue in which they lie, they often become varicose and then cause the condition known as "varicocele." Among them the spermatic artery is usually found injected, while close to the vas another smaller artery, the deferential or artery of the vas, may be found. A third artery, the cremasteric, is a constituent of the cord in the inguinal canal, but has probably reached the cremaster muscle by this time. Three nerves are bound up with the cord in the inguinal canal; the most important of these is Ihe spervmtic plexus of

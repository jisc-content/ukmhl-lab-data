PRACTICAL ANATOMY 180 its inferior surface lies against the right kidney, duodenum, and stomach, its posterior surface is in contact with the right dome of the diaphragm, right suprarenal capsule, inferior vena cava, middle part of diaphragm, oesophagus, and left dome. The viscera, including the stomach, should now be re- moved and examined more carefully, in order to see as much of their structure as can be done with the naked eye. Structuee of the Stomach.—Inflate the organ as fully as possible with the bellows, ligaturing the cBsophagus and duodenum close to the cardiac and pyloric orifices. Dissect off the peritoneum, noticing the delicate subserous cellular tissue. The muscular fibres of the stomach are arranged in three layers:— (1) The most superficial are longitudinal and are best marked' along the two curvatures, especially the lesser. As the pyloric canal is reached, they are more evenly arranged, so as to continue the uniform layer of the duodenum. (2) The circular layer of fibres is evenly disposed and is thickened at the pylorus, forming the constriction of that orifice. (3) The oblique fibres are best marked at the cardiac end, and may be described as astride of the fundus to the left of the cardiac orifice ; from this they radiate on the front and back of the stomach, disappearing as the great curvature and pyloric canal is approached. The submucous coat is well marked, and in it the blood . vessels break vip. The mucous membrane may be displayed by laymg open the whole stomach along its greater curvature. In a fresh stomach this layer has a pink colour, though in old people dark grey patches are often present. When the organ is undistended, the membrane is thrown into very prominent folds or vngse, which disappear on distension. Steucture of the Livee.—Look at the upper part of the slit-open vena cava, where it is embedded in the liver, and notice the entrance into it of the right, middle, and lett

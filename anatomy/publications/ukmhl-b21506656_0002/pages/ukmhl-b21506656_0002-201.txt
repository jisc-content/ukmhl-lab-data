189 LUMBAR PLEXUS The Lumbar branches of the Abdominal Aorta with their accompanying veins should next be followed from their origin, tracing them outwards behind the sympathetic cord and lumbar plexus. The upper two pass behind the crura of the diaphragm, the upper three run behind the quadratus lumborum muscle, the last, with remarkable constancy, running in front of the muscle. Near the outer border of this muscle the vessels pierce the lamellte of the lumbar fascia and run forward between the transversaUs and internal oblique muscles. The dissection of the upper portion of the abdomen may now be considered as almost completed, and attention should next be directed to the lower portion. It will be convenient to separate the two portions by cutting through the inter- vertebral disc which lies between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrÂ£e, but before doing so the aorta should be divided just above its bifurcation and the vena cava at the same level, in order that the whole length of the common iliac vessels may be dissected with the pelvis. The vertebral column, so far as it is formed by the upper four lumbar vertebrte, should be stripped of its muscles in order that those ligaments which could not be exposed from the back may be seen. Running downwards in front of the bodies of the vertebrifi as a broad ribbon-like band is the Anterior Common Liga- ment. The Intertransverse Ligaments which pass between the adjacent transverse processes should be exposed by removing the various muscles attached to these processes. The Capsular Ligaments attached to the articular processes around the articular facets should be similarly exposed. Finally, the Intervertebral disc must be examined; it will be seen to be tough and fibrous at the periphery, soft and pulpy in the centre, and to be formed by a series of concentric rings made of fibrous tissvie and fibro-cartilage alternately. The soft central part is kno-\vn as the nucleus pulposus.

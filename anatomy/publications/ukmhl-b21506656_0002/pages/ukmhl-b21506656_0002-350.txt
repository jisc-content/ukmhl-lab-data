PRACTICAL ANATOMY 338 the skin of the dorsum of the distal phalanges of the outer 3?, digits; indeed, the overlap of these cutaneous nerves in the . hand is so great that in some cases in which the radial nerve is divided no loss of sensation is appreciable. The dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve was seen passing back from the main nerve deep to the tendon of the Hexor carpi ulnaris. It should be picked up where it is emerging from the posterior border of the tendon and traced to the dorsal surface of the little and ring fingers. One of - its branches almost always communicates with the radial nerve, and it often directly supplies the ulnar (inner) 2^ instead of 1| digits. As in the outer fingers, the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve does not supply the skin over the terminal phalanx. This is done by the palmar branch. The experience gained in dissecting these nerves will probably have impressed this generalisation upon the dis- sectorâ€”that the cutaneous nerves are deep to the superficial veins until the former become very fine branches. Deeper Dissection of the Back of the Forearm Remove the deep fascia as high as can be managed with- out injuring the subjacent muscles; where these are obviously rising from the fascia, it must be left. Be careful of the posterior annular ligament [lig. carpi dorsale], which is on a higher level than the anterior, and is attached to the lower end of the radius externally, bridging over the four grooves on that bone ; internally it goes lower and reaches the cunei- form bone as well as the lower end of the ulna. It is a thickening of the deep fascia, and acts as a strap to prevent the extensor tendons starting up during extension of the wrist. The muscles of the back of the forearm are arranged in two layers, of which the more superficial arise from the external condyle or supracondylar ridge of the humerus as well as from the fascia covering them, and the intermuscular septa separating them from adjacent muscles.

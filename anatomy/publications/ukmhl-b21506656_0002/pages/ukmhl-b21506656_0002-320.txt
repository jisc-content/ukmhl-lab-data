PRACTICAL ANATOMY 308 deeply to the flexor longus pollicis tendon, and will be seen better later on. The superficial volar artery [ramus volaris superficialis] comes off just above the wrist, and runs to the muscles of the ball of the thumb (see Fig. 310). It varies greatly in size and also in its depth from the surface. Sometimes it may be seen in the living body pulsating deep to the skin of the front of the wrist. The Ulnar artery is larger than the radial, and has a deeper course. Its beginning is seen in the antecubital fossa, while for some distance above the wrist it is easily exposed, as it is just to the outer side of and somewhat over- lapped by the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris (see Fig. 310). Between these two parts, however, the artery tunnels deep to all the superficial flexor muscles except the flexor carpi ulnaris, and its course may be marked on the living fore- arm by taking the point of bifurcation of the brachial—a finger's-breadth below the middle of the bend of the elbow and drawing a curved line with its convexity inward dowm to the outer side of the pisiform bone. Replace the cut superficial head of the pronator radii teres, as well as the flexor carpi radiaUs and palmaris longus, in order to realise the depth of the artery. Notice, too, that the best way of reaching it in the upper part of the forearm is to follow the intermuscular septum between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor sublimis digitorum (see Fig. 311).

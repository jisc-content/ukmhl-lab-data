THE ARM 287 the crease which indicates the position of this at the bond of the elbow. The artery never really touches the humerus, but is only separated from it by such a thickness of muscle that it can be compressed against the bone by deep pressure. Notice that in the upper part of its course this pressure must be directed from within outwards to be eftective, while lower down it has to be directed from before backwards.

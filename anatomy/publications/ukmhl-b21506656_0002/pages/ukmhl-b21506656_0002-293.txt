THE ARM 281 cutaneons twigs pierce the muscle and supply the skin covering it. The posterior circumflex artery [a. circumiiexa humeri posterior] should now he traced through the space into the deltoid muscle. Its close relation to the surgical neck of the humerus is important, since it is so often lacerated in fractures and dislocations here, and is the cause of great extravasation of blood. On the inner side of the long head of the triceps is the triangtdar space of the upper part of the arm; it is bounded externally by the triceps, superiorly by the subscapularis when looked at from in front, and by the teres minor when looked at from behind, inferiorly by the teres major. When looked at from in front, the dorsalis scapulce branch of the subscapular artery seems to be passing through, though, before reaching the back, it dips in between the teres minor and the axillary border of the scapula, grooving the bone and usually dividing into an upper and a lower branch as it does so. THE ARM Surface Markings First study the surface markings, using the bared arm of a companion to contrast the landmarks during life with those on the dead body. In considering the surface markings of the pectoral region the coraco-brachialis was noticed. Just to its outer side is the prominence of the biceps occupying the front of the arm, and on each side of this is a groove, the external and internal bicipital sulcus. Deep to the internal bicipital sulcus lies the basilic vein, and, deeper still, the brachial artery and median nerve. Deep to the outer bicipital sulcus, which is not so well marked as the inner, lies the cephalic vein.

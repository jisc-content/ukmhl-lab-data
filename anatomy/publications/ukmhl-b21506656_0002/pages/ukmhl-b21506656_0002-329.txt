THE PALM 317 localising joints and bony points the hand examined should be constantly moved. The bases of the metacarpal bones and the carpo-meta- carpal articulation are about an inch below the line of the wrist, though they cannot be well felt from the palm. On the ulnar side the hook of the unciform bone should be felt for below and internal to the pisiform. In strong muscular hands it is impossible to make it out, and so it is usually in fat hands, but in slender or emaciated hands it is often easily felt. It is quite in harmony with a work on practical anatomy to advise the reader to examine carefully every hand on which his eyes rest, to learn how greatly hands differ, and how many points are available for a practised observer to note from which he may draw deductions. To gain the power of accurately and rapidly summing up a hand only needs practice, and, when gained, this power is often very useful to a practitioner of medicine. The metacarpo-phalangeal joints are about half an inch below (nearer the fingers) the lowest of the three well- marked lines on the hand except opposite the index finger, where the line and the joint correspond. The webs of the fingers and the transverse creases on the palmar aspect of the junction of the fingers with the palm are opposite the middle of the proximal phalanges, but the other transverse creases on the fingers correspond to the interphalangeal joints. It is of great practical advantage to remember that the length of the terminal joint of a man's index finger is an inch while the breadth across the fingers of a man's hand is from 2f to 3 inches. Skin Incisions.â€”The hand should be nailed to the table or to a wooden block by long tacks driven through the terminal phalanx of each finger. When the day's dissecting is over these may easily be withdrawn from the wood but left in the fingers. A vertical incision should be made down the middle of

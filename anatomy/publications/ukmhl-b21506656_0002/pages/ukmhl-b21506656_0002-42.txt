30 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the anterior interventricular or septal branch, while the rest of the artery runs round the left side of the heart to the back in the left auriculo-ventricular sulcus. The course of these arteries is in most cases obscured by a good deal of fat. If the upper portion of the left ventricle be examined just below the aortic semilunar valves, the walls will be seen to be fibrous and therefore unaffected by the contraction of the left ventricle. This portion of the ventricle is known as the aortic vestibule. It permits of the free action of the semilunar valves. The student should make himself thoroughly famihar with the appearance of these valves in the healthy condi- tion, in order that later on he may be able to detect the earliest effects of disease. The relation of these valves to the chest wall should be made out as far as possible, though it is of no very great clinical importance. It is given in the accompanying diagram, which may be verified by the various thoracic sections. THE DISSECTION OF THE PLEURAL SACS AND LUNGS IN SITU The dissection of the pleural sacs and lungs should now be undertaken. Begin by stripping the mediastinal pleura from the pericardium, a procedure often rendered difficult by adhesions. In the space between the two the only structures to be found are the phrenic nerves, one on either side, accom- panied by a small companion artery, a branch of the internal mammary. The nerve may be freed from surrounding parts for an inch or two, but not further, or many of its important relations will be rendered difficult of verification. The lung should now be pulled well outwards, thereby exposing clearly its root, from which the pleura should be carefully dissected, retaining all lymphatic nodes and trying to preserve a number of fine nerves which constitute the

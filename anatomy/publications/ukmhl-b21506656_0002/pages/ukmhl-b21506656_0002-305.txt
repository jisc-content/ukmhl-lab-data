293 THE AKM The external relations of the brachial artery are:— Muscles.—Coraco-brachialis above, brachialis anticus, biceps and brachio-radialis below. Veins.—External vena comes. Nerves.—Median above. All these structures have been examined except the hrachio-radialis, which here is forming the outer boundary of the antecubital fossa. The internal relations of the brachial artery are :— Muscles.—Pronator radii teres. Fibrous Structures.—Deep fascia of arni; Arteries.—The origins of its branches, the inferior pro- funda and anastomotica magna arteries. Veins.—Basilic and the internal vena comes. Nerves.—Ulnar and internal cutaneous'i above and median below. I The pronator radii teres is here fjDrming the inner boundary of the antecubital fossa, the relations and contents of which may now be reviewed. i The antecubital fossa is a triangular; space situated in front of the elbow, and having its apex directed downwards. Its base is an imaginary horizontal line' drawn from just above one condyle to just above the other; its outer side is the brachio-radialis, its inner the pronator radii teres, while its floor is the brachialis anticus. In this- space the tendon of the biceps runs vertically down, having the brachial artery and venae comites on its inner side and the median nerve still more internal. On the outer side of the biceps the end of the musculo-spiral nerve is hidden by the coalesced brachialis anticus and brachio-radialis; it divides into its two terminal branches the radial and posterior inter- osseous, while superficial to the termination of the artery are the antecubital lymphatic nodes. Ulnar iVerwe.—Trace this down from where it was left in the axilla, and notice how close it lies to the inner side of the brachial artery until the middle of the arm is reached; then

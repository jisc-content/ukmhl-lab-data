THE PENIS AND SCROTUM 91 The loose tissue surrounding llie corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum should now be removed ; the ternnnation of the former at the corona, and the continuity of the latter with the glans being shown. The catheter should now be withdrawn and two trans- verse sections made of the penis, one near the scrotum, the other through the middle of the glans. In the first the two corpora cavernosa will be seen to have thick fibrous walls surrounding the cavernous erectile tissue. "Where the two S.D.V. D.A. D.D.V S.P.' cc.

The corpus spongiosum has a much less dense sheath, and its erectile tissue is more delicate than that of the corpora cavernosa. Rather nearer its dorsal than its ventral surface, and embedded in it, is the urethra, which is here

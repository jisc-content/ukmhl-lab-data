312 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the upper two-thirds and deep fascia in the lower third of the forearm. Its relation to the pisiform will possibly be remembered from the fact that it grooves the outer side of that bone, while the fact that it actually grooves the bone shows that it lies on the ulnar or inner side of the ulnar artery. In its course look out for branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris and to the inner half of the flexor profundus digitorum, as well as for its palmar and dorsal cutaneous branches. The latter should be looked for running backwards deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon; the others have been seen already (see Fig. 312). The posterior or deep relations of the ulnar artery in the forearm are only the brachialis anticus and the flexor profundus digitorum. The Flexor Profundus digitorum rises from the upper two-thirds of the anterior and internal surfaces of the ulna, and is dovetailed into by the insertion of the brachialis anticus above, reaching back as far as the posterior border of the ulna. As the middle of the forearm is reached the fleshy mass divides into four tendons, but notice that the outer one, for the index-finger, is much more distinctly separated than are those of the rest of the fingers. This is a valuable lesson on the way in which independent action of a part of a fleshy mass gradually leads to longitudinal segmentation of that mass, because the index is the finger which is used by itself more than any of the others. The branches of the ulnar artery in the forearm are : (1) anterior ulnar recurrent; (2) posterior ulnar recurrent; (3) coinmon interosseous; (4) muscular; (5) anterior ulnar carpal; (6) posterior ulnar carpal. The Anterior Ulnar Recurrent Artery is a small branch running up to the front of the internal condyle, where it anastomoses with the termination of the anterior branch of the anastomotica magna, though a very successful injection is needed to show the anastomosis.

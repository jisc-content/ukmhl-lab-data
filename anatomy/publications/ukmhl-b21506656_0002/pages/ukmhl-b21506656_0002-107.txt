95 THE SCROTUM The Testis Examine Lbe transverse section of the testis carefully. If it is fresh enough it will show a firm white capsule, the tunica albugi7iea, just within the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis, while at its posterior part this capsule is thickened and pushed into the substance of the testis to form the mediastimovi testis (see Fig. 231). From this some very delicate white lines radiate towards the periphery of the organ, which are the vertical septa, and together with the hoi-izontal septa, not seen in this section, divide the organ into lobules or lociili containing the semi- niferous tubules. In a very fresh specimen some of these extremely delicate, hair-like tubules may be teased out under water. They are some two feet in length, and the total length of all the tubules of the two testes would probably exceed a mile. The Epididymis The part of the epididymis seen in this section is known as the body, and hardly touches the testis, being separated by the digital fossa. In the other specimen the whole length of the epididymis is seen lying along the back of the testis as a soft glandular mass; above it enlarges to form the head or globus major [caput epididymis], which fits on to the top of the testis like a cap, while below is another smaller enlargement called the tail or globus minor [cauda epididymis]. It will be noticed that the head is largely covered by the tunica vaginalis, and so is the outer side and front of the body, but on the inner side the spermatic cord lies close to the body, without any serous membrane intervenino-. Draw the globus major very gently away from the testis under water. Under very favourable conditions some fifteen

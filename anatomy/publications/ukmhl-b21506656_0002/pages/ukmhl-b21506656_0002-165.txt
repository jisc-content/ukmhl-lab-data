DUODENUM AND PANCREAS 153 it reaches the level of the subcostal plane at the third lumbar vertebra, at which level it passes from right to loft across the vertebral column ; it then turns upwards behind the stomach to the level of the 2nd lumbar vertebra on the left side, at which point it bends sharply forwards to form the duodeno- jejunal flexure. It will thus be seen that the duodenum, some nine or ten inches in length, forms a horse-shoe-Hke curve, with its Fig. 254.â€”The Duodeno-jejunal Fosa^, P. Pancreas. D. Duodenum. /.

Four parts of it are usually recognised, the first horizontal lying in close relation to the gall bladder, and having the gastro-duodenal artery, common bile duct, and portal vein behind it (see Fig. 255). The second part runs vertically downwards in front of the hilum of the right kidney, and is covered in front by the fundus of the gall bladder, the Hver, the beginning of the transverse colon, and the racso-colon.

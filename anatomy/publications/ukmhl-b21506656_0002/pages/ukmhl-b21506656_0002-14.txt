2 PEACTICAL ANATOMY wards, that whereas the upper ribs move upwards and the lower ribs outwards, the last rib remains immovable, that the infracostal angle is widened, and that in easy inspiration the ventral abdominal wall moves forwards, whereas in deep inspiration it is retracted. On examining the thorax of an articulated skeleton, the student will see that the posterior wall is formed by a narrow column of twelve vertebrre, the bodies of which increase in size from above downwards in accordance with the greater weight they have to support, that the anterior wall is con- stituted by the sternum, and that on the anterior surface of this bone, at the level of the second costal cartilages, a transverse ridge can be felt, called the angle of Louis [Angulus sterni]. This ridge is on the same horizontal plane as the lower surface of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra. It will also be seen that the lateral walls are represented by twelve pairs of rib arches, all of which articu- late behind with the vertebral column, but only the upper seven reach the sternum. The eighth, ninth, and tenth arches are connected anteriorly with each other, and through the eighth with the seventh. The last two arches end freely. While, therefore, the upper ten arches must move more or less together, the lower two are more independent. It will further be seen that the costal arches are bony until they reach within a few inches of the sternum, where they become cartilaginous. The spaces between the arches, the intercostal spaces, are wider above than below, and each can be seen to become wider as it is traced forward; in other words, the costal arches tend to spread. THE THORACIC WALL First clean the superficial muscle, the external intercostal, of an intercostal space. One of the upper spaces, say, the fourth, will be preferable, on account of its -vndth. In clean- ing the muscle the lateral cutaneous branch of the corre-

THE PERINEUM 105 present, or may be present on one side only. It rises from the junction of the tuber ischii with the subpubic ramus, and is inserted into the central point of the perineum. If the deep perineal nerve is followed forward from the ischio-rectal fossa, it will be found to enter and supply these three muscles. Now clear away the bulbo - cavernosus muscle and examine the bulb (Fig. 234, B.), which is the posterior end of the corpus spongiosum, and is a mass of erectile tissue surrounding the urethra, which is here slightly enlarged. It will be well to lay open the part of the urethra contained in the bulb. In the same way dissect the ischio-cavernosus muscle away from the crus penis in order to examine this latter structure. Each crus is attached to the inner surface of the ischial ramus close to its lower border. Cut into one of them, and notice how the erectile tissue of the corpus caver- nosum gradually gives way to the fibrous tissue of the crus near its attachment. Now separate the crura penis from the bone, and remove the bulb, very carefully cutting through the urethra just behind it. Cut the dorsal vessels of the penis as long as possible, so as to be able to identify them easily hereafter. Occupying the triangular space between the pubic rami, and forming the floor of the superficial perineal compartment, is a dense but very indefinite mass of connective tissue known from its position and shape as the superficial layer of the triangular ligament. Behind it fuses with Colles' fascia, laterally with the subpubic rami, while anteriorly it ends in a strong band situated immediately underneath the dorsal vein of the penisâ€”^/le transverse perineal ligament. It will be found to give a fascial expansion which covers the bulb. It is pierced in the mid line, an inch below the symphysis, by the urethra, and close to this, on either side the artery to the bulb (Fig. 234, A.B.) and the duct of Cowper's gland should be sought. Just below the sym-

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 166 (2) The Gosliac Axis, already studied (see p. 163). (3) The Superior Mesenteric, which rises just below the last, and has a considerable course behind the head of the pancreas before it passes through the notch in that viscus. (4) TJie Middle Capsular [a. suprarenalis media], on each side. (5) TJie Renal, on each side, which gives oft' the inferior capsular [a. suprarenalis inferior]. (6) The Spermatic [a. testicularis] or Ovarian [a. ovarica], on each side. (7) The Inferior Mesenteric, coming off from the front of the aorta about 1\ inch above its bifurcation. (8) Tlie Lumbar Arteries, four on each side, rising from the back of the aorta. (9) Th^ Middle Sacral, also rising from the back of the aorta about half an inch above its bifurcation. Of these Nos. 1, 8, and 9 are parietal arteries, while the others are visceral. In exposing the beginnings of these arteries the solar plexus should not be forgotten. It will be found to send prolongations upwards and downwards along-the aorta as well as along all its branches to the various viscera of the abdomen. In this way there are aortic, diaphragmatic, capsular, renal, superior mesenteric, spermatic and inferior mesenteric plexuses. Along the branches of the coeliac axis there are coronary, hepatic and splenic plexuses, while the aortic plexus is continued downwards over the bifurcation to form a large plexus—i/ie hypogastric—\n front of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The solar plexus is not entirely sympathetic, seeing that it receives a few twigs from the vagus of either side. In the dissection just described a number of lymphatic nodes are usually encountered; they He at the side of the ^ovtii-^uxta-aortic group—in front of the aovtii-pre-aortiG —and behind the aorta.—retro-aortic. Among these aortic nodes, and especially near the renal and splenic arteries, look

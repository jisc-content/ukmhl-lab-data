104 PRACTICAL ANATOMY In the mid line the bulb of the corpus spongiosum (Fig. 234, B.) will be seen covered by a thin sheath of muscle, the hulbo-cavernosus (B.C.M.). Notice that this is a bilateral muscle rising behind from the central point or tendon of the perineum and further forward from a median raphe on the surface of the bulb. The fibres surround the bulb and are for the most part Tr.PM B CF. Fig. 235. Dissection to expose the Anterior Layer of the Triangular Ligajient on its Superficial Aspect. S.P.L. Subpubic Ligament.

Line of Attachment of CoUes' Fascia (dotted). inserted into its upper surface, but some of the more anterior surround the corpora cavernosa and meet above the dorsal vein of the penis. On each side of the bulb is the crus penis (Fig. 235, CP.) covered by the ischio-cavernosus muscle (I.C.M.), which rises from the inner side of the tuber ischii and is inserted into the outer side of the crus. The third muscle in this compartment is the transversus perinei (Fig. 235, Tr.P.M.), which, however, is not always

In the section through the glans the urethra has usually a ±-shaped appearance, thus giving greater room for expan- sion. The expanded part is known as the fossa navicularis, but at the meatus it contracts again into a vertical slit, which is the narrowest part of the whole urethra; so that, in a healthy urethra, any instrument which will pass through the meatus will reach the bladder.

In the fossa navicularis look for a delicate crescentic pocket on the roof, with its openmg towards the meatus—this is the lacuna magna [valvula fossEC navicularis], and sometimes engages the pomt of a very small catheter; it is usually about an mch from the meatus.

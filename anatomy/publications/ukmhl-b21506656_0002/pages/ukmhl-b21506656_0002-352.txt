340 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The outermost of the superHcial layers of muscles is the extensor carpi radialis longior [E.C.R. longus], which comes from the lower third of the external supracondylar ridge, and is remarkable for the shortness of its fleshy belly ; as it passes downwards its tendon will be seen to pass deep to two muscles of the deeper layer, the extensor ossis metacarpi P.Long, F.S.D.

After that the tendon passes through the second of the four grooves, on the lower end of the radius, which is the outermost groove on the back of that bone, because the first groove is on the outer side and not really upon the back. Passing over the carpal bones, the tendon is inserted into the outer side of the meta-

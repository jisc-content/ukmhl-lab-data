PRACTICAL ANATOMY 94 side of the scrotum to the other, because the deeper layer of the dartos forms a median septum. With a very little dissection the testis, enclosed in its parietal tunica vaginalis or bag-like covering, may be lifted out, and the spermatic cord exposed as far as the external abdominal ring. Examine the laid-open coverings of the cord carefully, because they are the coverings of an inguinal herniaâ€”the commonest form of rupture. Deep to the skin and superficial fascia look for the external spermatic fascia, then the cremaster muscle thinning out into the cremasteric fascia, and deep to that the internal spermatic or infundibuliform fascia. All these have been dealt with already in the dissection of the inguinal t canal. Slit open the tunica vaginalis from in front, when the testis and epididymis will be seen. Kotice that the tunica vaginalis is a closed sac into which the testis and part of the epididymis are invaginated from behind, so that all the testis, except a strip down its posterior part where the vessels enter it, or where the epidi- dymis touches it, is covered by the glossy visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis. On the outer side the tunica vaginalis forms a pouch between 'the testis and the epididymis, known as the digital fossa., very useful in recognising the side of a removed testis (Fig. 231, D.F.). Dissect out the other testis in its unopened tunica vaginalis, cutting the cord at the level of the external abdominal ring. Take a large sharp knife and make a clean transverse section through the testis and epididymis, as well as through the bag enclosing them. This will give a very good idea of the relations of the various structures, as well as the mode of reflexion of the tunica vaginalis, particularly if the specimen is placed in a vessel of water.

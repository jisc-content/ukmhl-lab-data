136 PRACTICAL ANATOMY to their origin from the splenic vessels near the hilum of the spleen. The absence of lymphatic nodes in association with the fmidus of the stomach should be noted. Next examine the blood vessels which run along the remainder of the great curvature; these are, on the left, running toAvards the right, the left gastro-epiploic, a branch of the splenic; and on the right, running to the left, the right gastro-epiploic, a branch of the gastro-duodenal artery from the hepatic. These arteries should be carefully followed, and they will then be seen to send branches upwards on to the stomach and downwards into the great omentum. Along the right gastro-epiploic particularly a number of lymphatic nodes should be sought [lympho-glandulse gastricse inferiores]. This chain is still thicker along the lower border of the pylorus, and can be followed upwards behind the pylorus; there thus being a sub-pylorie and a retro-pyloric group. These groups are of importance because of the frequent incidence of cancer in this region of the stornach. The Liver At this point it will be convenient to leave the stomach for further consideration later, and to direct attention to the Liver, the largest gland in the body. It has the shape of a pyramid, the base being to the right and the apex to the left. The sides of the pyramid are formed by the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior surfaces. Of these the superior, anterior, and a part of the inferior can be now studied. The superior and anterior surfaces are divided into two by the falciform ligament. This passes from the superior and anterior surfaces of the liver to the under surface of the diaphragm, and to the anterior abdominal wall, as low as the umbilicus. In its inferior free edge, as has been noticed already, the Hgamentum teres or obhterated umbilical vein can be felt. In many cases a small artery and vein can be traced along the ligamentum teres as far as the trans-

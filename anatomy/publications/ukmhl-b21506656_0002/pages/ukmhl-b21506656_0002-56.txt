44 PRACTICAL ANATOMY major, and the rings of the trachea will probably be felt. Further upwards, near the dome of the pleura, feel for the outward sweep of the innominate artery and its continuation the right subclavian. The outline of the right phrenic nerve is easily traced upwards along the right side of the superior vena cava, from where it is exposed in front of the root of the lung, but the position of the right vagus is more difficult to localise; the best way is to trace it up with the finger from behind the root of the lung, where it forms the pos- terior pulmonary plexus, along the right side of the trachea, but remember that, as it runs upwards, it comes forwards so as to gain the interval between the right subclavian vein in front and' the corresponding artery behind. Notice that the oesophagus does not always come into contact with the right pleura in the superior mediastinum. Form and Relations of the Lungs after Removal Now that the structures in contact with the parietal pleura have been localised, the relations of the lungs will be more easy to follow. In formalin-hardened bodies the lungs usually preserve their shape very well, and the various mouldings of surrounding vessels and viscera are often quite clear. If, however, from disease or imperfect injection, the lungs are useless, the student is advised to refer to the models of His, which are available in almost every dissect- ing-room. Notice that each lung is a pyramid, the apex of which projects upwards into the root of the neck, while the base is deeply concave for the cupola of the diaphragm. Laterally, each lung is markedly convex from before back- ward, and usually shows shallow grooves rumiing downwai^ds and forwards, where it presses against the ribs. The medial surface shows the cut root, and in front of that a concavity to receive the*heart and pericardium. The ventral border of each lung is sharp, while the

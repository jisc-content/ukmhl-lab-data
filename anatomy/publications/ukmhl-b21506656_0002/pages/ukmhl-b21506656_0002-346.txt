PRACTICAL ANATOMY 334 In dissecting these palmar and dorsal interossei right up to their insertions, notice that they pass dorsal to the deep transverse metacarpal ligament which joins the palmar ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the four fingers together. By this ligament, therefore, they are separated from the lumbricals. Another and much more feeble ligament joins the heads of the metacarpal bones of the fingers together behind. This is the dorsal transverse metacarpal ligament, which, with the deep transverse liga- Dor.T.M.Lig.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 34 a large vein ascending in front of the bodies of the vertebrae passing behind the root of the hing and arching forward above it to open into the back of the superior vena cava where the latter emerges from the pericardium about the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. This is the vena azygos major [V. azygos], which will be seen better later on. The right lung should now be remeved in the same way as the left, and the two put aside carefully in an air-tight tank or jar. Their relations cannot be studied profitably until some idea of the mediastina has been obtained. THE MEDIASTINA All that part of the middle of the thorax which lies between the two pleural cavities is artificially divided into superior, anterior, middle and posterior mediastina. It is therefore clear that each mediastinum will have the pleura as its lateral boundary. The Superior Mediastinum is a space bounded above by the upper obhque aperture of the thorax; below by an imaginary plane passing horizontally backwards from the junction of the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum to the lower margin of the fourth thoracic vertebra; anteriorly by the manubrium sterni; and posteriorly by the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the upper four thoracic vertebrae. The Anterior Mediastinum is that narrow space between the pleurae which lies in front of the pericardium, below the angle of Louis, above the diaphragm and behind the gladiolus. As the pleurte were seen to be in contact do^vn to the level of the fourth rib, this anterior mediastinum is only a potential space until the left pleura leaves the right to form the cardiac notch. The Middle Mediastinum is the part of the thorax occupied by the pericardium, but contains in addition the two phrenic nerves and the roots of the lungs. The Posterior. Mediastinum is the region bounded m

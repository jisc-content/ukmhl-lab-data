358 PRACTICAL ANATOMY sion, the fovmor limited by the soft parts of the arm and forearm coming into contact, the latter by the olecranon process fitting into its fossa, and the tension of the anterior ligament. The elbow, therefore, is a hinge joint or ginglymus, another variety of the diarthroses. Open the joint by a bold horizontal sweep of the knife round the front of the capsule, dividing the anterior and two lateral parts. Notice that the internal lateral ligainent [lig. coUaterale ulnare] has two bands or thickenings, one running from the internal condyle to the coronoid process, the other to the olecranon. The single thickening of the external lateral ligament [lig. collaterale radiale] blends below with the orbicular ligament. It will be seen that the synovial membrane does not line the capsule quite closely in all parts; opposite the three fossa; of the humerus little wedge-shaped pads of fat separate the two structures and fill the depressions when they are not occupied by the bones which fit into them. Other pads are seen on each side of the front of the root of the olecranon process, as well as on the external part of the capsule between the head of the radius and the capitellum. Notice that the cavity of the elbow joint is continuous with that of the superior radio-ulnar joint. This is really important, since any trouble affecting the one is likely to spread to the other. Pass a fine seeker down between the orbicular ligament and the head of the radius, and notice that the ligament is attached to the neck of the bone by a thin but lax membrane. The movements of this joint are best studied with those of the other radio-ulnar articulations. The MIDDLE RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION COnsistS of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament. The interosseous membrane has fibres which run down- wards and inwards from the interosseous border of the radius

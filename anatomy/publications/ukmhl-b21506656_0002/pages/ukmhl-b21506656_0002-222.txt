PRACTICAL ANATOMY 210 the anal canal, as the last inch of the gut is called, is left in the floor of the pelvis. At the end of the pelvic colon the anterior and external tsenise coli may be seen to come together to form a single band, while by the time the rectum is reached the longi- tudinal fibres of the large intestine are arranged uniformly round the gut. Within these the gut is surrounded by circular fibres, which are augmented in the region of the anal canal to form the internal sphincter. The external sphincter is situated outside the longitudinal fibres. If the rectum be now slit open by a medial incision its mucous membrane will be exposed, and some prominent shelf-like folds, known as the valves of Houston [plicÂ® trans- versales recti], will be seen. As a rule, there are two of these, onq on the right, the other on the left side, but occasionally three, or even four, are found. One of them, usually the lowest, is situated opposite the point whence the peritoneum is reflected from the rectum to the bladder or uterus, as the case may be. It is believed that normally the faeces, except durmg defsecation, he above the valves. The mucous membrane of the rectum is vascular, thick and soft, particularly when compared with that of the anal canal. It is marked on its surface by a number of small apertures, the mouths of rectal pits, which contain a considerable amount of lymphoid tissue in their walls. The last inch of the rectum is known as. the anxii canal, and is closed in life by the apposition of the two lateral walls. Its direction is downwards and backwards, and it is sur- rounded by the sphincter muscles. Unless the anus is excised this part of the gut will probably be left m the perineum, and should be examined there. The lumen of the anal canal is much smaller than that ot the rectum, and the change from the one part of the tube to the other is usually particularly abrupt, because that part ot the rectum which lies between the lower valve of Houston

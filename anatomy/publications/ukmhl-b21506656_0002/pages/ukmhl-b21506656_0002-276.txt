264 PRACTICAL ANATOMY cords with their branches are found, and in its first part these arc all massed on the outer side and somewhat behind the artery. Here, too, the external anterior thoracic nerve is given off from the outer cord, and so it is an external as well as an anterior relation of the artery. The branches of the first part of the axillary artery are the acromio-thoracic and the superior thoracic, both of which have been dissected. The second part of the axillary artery lies behind the pectoralis minor. Its only anterior relations are that muscle and the internal anterior thoracic nerve. The internal anterior thoracic nerve has been seen pierc- ing the pectoralis minor muscle, which it supplies, and then goes on to innervate the lower half of the pectoralis major. When the pectoralis minor is reflected the nerve should be looked ^or coming forward between the axillary artery and vein at a considerably lower level than the external anterior thoracic. It usually forms a loop of communication with the external anterior thoracic, which runs obliquely in front of the artery. The posterior relations of the second part of the axillary artery are the subscapularis muscle, separated by a good deal of cellular tissue, and the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. Coming off from this cord, either here or higher up, are the three subscapular nerves, which should now be looked for. The upper subscapular nerve needs rather careful search; hook the axillary vessels and brachial plexus outwards, when the nerve, which may be double, is seen entering the anterior surface of the subscapularis about midway between its upper and lower borders and also between its origin and insertion. The middle or long subscapular nerve enters the latissi- mus dorsi, in which it ends. It accompanies the subscapular artery, and, if the lower border of the subscapularis is care- fully cleaned, is sure to be found.

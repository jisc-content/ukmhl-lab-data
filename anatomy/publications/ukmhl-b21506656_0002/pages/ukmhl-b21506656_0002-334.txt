PRACTICAL ANATOMY 322 absence co-exists with a double abductor, a mistake may easily be made, though, even if it is, it is of little practical importance. The dee2^ branch [ramus profundus] of the ulnar nerve should be looked for as it sinks between these two muscles. The opponens minimi digiti [m. opponens digiti quinti] may usually be displayed by drawing the two last muscles apart without dividing them, though this may be done if necessary. It rises from the hook of the unciform and anterior annular ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of the shaft of the metacarpal bone. The nerve supply of these three short muscles of the little finger will be found coming from the deep branch of the uhiar nerve. Now trace the ulnar artery in the hand. This artery was followed in the forearm as far as the outer side of the pisiform bone, from which it is separated by the ulnar nerve. It reaches the hand by passing superficial to the inner part of the anterior annular ligament, to which it is often bound by some transverse fibres. It now passes deep to the palmaris brevis, and gives off its deep branch, which sometimes accompanies the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, but more often sinks deeply into the palm on the outer (radial) side of all the short muscles of the little finger. Now reflect the central part of the deep fascia which conceals and protects the rest of the ulnar artery. When this is done the artery is seen to form the Superficial Palmar Arch [arcus volaris superficialis], with its convexity towards the fingers. This arch is sometimes completed by the superficialis volse branch of the radial artery, sometimes by a branch of the radial to the thumb or index finger, while sometimes it is not completed at all. It is important to notice the exact position of this arch since it is easily injured. The middle of the three creases on the palm, opposite the middle and ring fingers, is always

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 240 then should be prolonged until it meets the long median incision. It will be found that the skin of the back is very thick, but experience as to this may be cheaply bought in the mid line, where there is nothing to be injured by too deep an incision. Reflect the flaps outwards, and look out for the cutaneoxi^ branches of the 'posterior primary divisions of the spivul nerves. The third thoracic is the largest of these, and runs out towards the acromial process. No Avords can teach a student to recognise a small nerve as it lies embedded in its sur- rounding connective tissue, yet with a little experience these structures are recognised quickly enough. It is best to hunt for cutaneous nerves where they are first becoming cutaneous, and to remember that here they are often accompanied by small arteries and veins, and are of a dead, creamy-white colour, while fibrous strands are of a bluish-white tint. Bear this in mind, and clean away the cellular tissue near the third thoracic spine until the surface of the trapezius is reached. Let each cut be clean and definite, and carefully examine each structure about to be cut through before actually dividing it. About an inch outside this spine look especially carefully, and the nerve will almost certainly be seen coming through the fibres of the trapezius muscle. Once seen it should be gently picked up with the forceps, and followed as far as the dissector's skill permits. Opposite each vertebral spine, with the exception of the lower cervicals, one of the posterior primary branches of the spinal nerves will be found; but as the lower part of the trunk is approached, the branches come to the surface farther away from the mid line, because each posterior primary division divides into external and mternal branches, and in the upper six thoracic nerves the internal branch becomes cutaneous, while in the lower six, or thereabouts,

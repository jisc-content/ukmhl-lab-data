202 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The Prostate lies some little distance below the peritoneum, and is surrounded by a considerable amount of cellular tissue, which forms its so-called capsule. In remov- ing this tissue a venous plexus should be sought lying among the layers of fascia—the "prostatic plexus. The capsule being removed, the prostate will be seen to have the size and shape of a Spanish chestnut, that is to say, it is an inverted pyramid having three surfaces, a base and an apex.

It forms a collar round the first part of the urethra 1^ inch deep. At the posterior part of its base it is traversed by a small transverse fissure, at which enter the common ejaculatory ducts formed by the union of the vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia.

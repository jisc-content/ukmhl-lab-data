PRACTICAL ANATOMY 300 Dissection of the Front of the Fobeaum Follow the arteries of the front of the forearm, examining in detail all the structures with which they and their branches are in contact. The bifurcation of the brachial artery was seen in the antecubital space on a level with the neck of the radius. In the living this point may be fixed by taking the middle of the antecubital triangle, just internal to the biceps tendon, and a finger's-breadth below the bend of the elbow. The radial artery is more superficial than the ulnar, and runs down to the front of the wrist, where it lies just on the outer side of the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Here it is so superficial that its pulsations are easily felt during life, and in addition to this the softness and elasticity of its coats may be d etermined by any one with sufficient experience. The surface marking of the artery is not a straight line from the bifurcation of the brachial artery to the radial side of the flexor carpi radialis at the wrist, but one with a slight con- vexity outwards. The anterior relations of the radial artery in the forearm are:— M%tsdes.—Brachio-radialis. Fibrous Structures.—Dee^ fascia of forearm. Vessels and Nerves.—radial vein and external cutan- eous nerve separated from the artery by the deep fascia. The origin of the brachio-radialis (or supinator longus) has already been seen; notice how. as it descends, it is wrapped inwards on to the front of the forearm. About bait- way down the forearm it becomes tendinous, and the tendon as it runs down, reverts to the outer side of the forearm and is inserted into the outer side of the lower end (epiphysis) ot the radius at the root of the styloid process. The only action of the brachio-radiaUs worthy of mention is that of a flexor of the elbow. A glance at the left forearm

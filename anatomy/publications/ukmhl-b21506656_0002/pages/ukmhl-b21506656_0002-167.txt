DUODENUM AND PANCREAS 155 denum are retro-peritoneal, and cannot at present be drawn aside. Most of the posterior relations, however, are large structures, and may be identified by the finger. Occupying the concavity of the duodenum, limited to the right by the descending portion, and projecting beyond the duodenum to the left, lies the Pancreas, a flattened, tongue-like viscus 5 to 6 inches long, with its right end or head enlarged and curved, like a shepherd's crook, around the superior mesenteric vessels, its left end or tail tapering to a pointed extremity, which is in intimate relation to the spleen. It has in front of it the stomach, and forms, as has been seen, an important part of the " stomach bed." That part of the pancreas which lies between the pylorus above and the duodeno-jejunal flexure below, that is to say, between the two ends of the duodenal horse-shoe, is known as the neck because it is more constricted than the rest of the organ; it is only about half an inch from side to side. All the rest of the pancreas from the neck to the tapering tail is spoken of as the body. Before making any further dissection, notice carefully the peritoneal relations of the parts. The first part of the duodenum has peritoneum of the greater sac in front and of the lesser sac behind, but Avhen the second part is reached the peritoneum is often lifted off the front for quite a large area by the beginning of the trans- verse colon, and there is no peritoneum behind, for here the duodenum is in contact with the hilum of the kidney. From the middle of the second part to the duodeno-jejunal flexure the tube is covered in front by the great sac, except where the root of the mesentery crosses it obliquely from above downwards and to the right. The pancreas is covered for the most part by the lesser sac; but if the divided trans- verse meso-colon be carefully looked at, it will be seen that its lower or posterior layer, which belongs to the great sac, turns downwards and covers the front of the lower part of

THE PALM 329 Rising from the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum in the pahn are the four htmhrical muscles. Of these the outer two rise from one tendon each, while the other two rise from contiguous sides of two tendons. Each lumbrical passes round the outer side of its own finger, lying in front of the deep transverse metacarpal liga- ment, which will be noticed later, to reach the dorsum, where it will be seen to join the expansion on the common extensor tendon. Dissect the outermost of these very carefully, and notice that it passes in front of the transverse axis, round which the metacarpo-phalangeal joint works ; consequently it is a flexor of this joint, and then, by pulhng on the extensor tendon, extends the two interphalangeal joints. The same facts apply to the other lumbricals, only they are not so easily exposed without separating the metacarpal bones. The nerves to the two outer lumbricals have been seen entering them on their superficial surface, but in the case of the two inner ones it is necessary to lift the muscles and to dissect their deep surface very carefully. When this is done a small twig from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve will be found entering each of them. Deep Structukes in the Palm Turn the long flexor tendons over the fingers and examine the adductors of the thumb, of which there are two. The adductor pollicis transversus rises from the palmar aspect of the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, and its fibres converge to a tendon which is inserted into the inner side of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is separated from the next muscle by the deep palmar arch. The adductor pollicis obliquus rises from the palmar surfaces of the os magnum, trapezoid, and the bases of the metacarpal bones of the index and medius finders. It runs

THE PENIS AND SCROTUM 89 tion is usually required. After the ligament has been passed, the handle of the catheter should be slowly lowered between the thighs, when the instrument will enter the bladder. The skin of the penis should now be fixed by stitching the pre- puce to the handle of the catheter. In formahn-preserved bodies the introduction of the catheter is a very difficult task, and the student must parti- cularly avoid using any force ; otherwise, he will make a false passage. If he fail after one or two attempts, the help of the demonstrator should be asked. Dissection of the Penis.â€”A median incision should now be made on the dorsum of the penis, and the skin care- fully reflected to the sides. In the middle line a super- ficial and deep dorsal vein of the penis will usually be seen. On either side of these the dorsal artery of the penis, and, still more laterally, the dorsal nerve of the 'penis. These should be traced forwards and backwards. The dorsal veins will be seen to begin at the corona giandis, where they are formed by the union of several small veins, which, beginning on the ventral aspect of the glans, run round the glans to the mid- dorsal line. In tracing the veins backwards towards the symphysis, a strong band of connective tissue will be met fastening the dorsum of the penis to the anterior abdominal wall; this is the suspensory ligament of the penis, and where it is attached the corpora cavernosa will be seen to be bent very sharply on themselves (see Fig. 228). Clear it away, when the superficial dorsal vein, when it is present, will be seen to divide into two vessels, which run into the superficial external pudic veins. The deep dorsal vein disappears by passing under the subpubic ligament. At the root of the penis, on either side, a careful search should be made for small twigs from the ilio-inguinal nerve, and from the superficial and deep external pudic vessels All the vessels are accompanied by fine lymphatic vessels.

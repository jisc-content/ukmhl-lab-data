254 PRACTICAL ANATOMY tissue between the distinct muscular bundles of the pector- alis major. This, however, is an observation which the author has never been able to verify. In its lower and outer third, whore the breast lies on the serratus magnus, there is a much thicker and more fatty bed. A section through this part of the gland should be made to prove the statement. In the nipple and areola there is no subcutaneous fat. Try to recognise in the nipple some of the lactiferous ducts, and follow them towards the substance of the gland. Below the base of the nipple each dilates into a little fusiform reservoir called the ampulla. Owing to the way in which the glandular tissue is embedded in fat, it is difficult to demonstrate the fifteen to twenty lobes of which it is formed, but a very serious attempt should be made to localise the margins of the organ. In the horizontal section it will be seen to reach the edge of the sternum medially, while laterally it reaches beyond the anterior axillary fold, sending a process called the axillary tail upwards and outwards into the axilla. Now make a vertical section through the gland, and notice that it extends in this direction from the second to the sixth ribs. The Deep Pectoeal Region and Axilla The student who is dissecting the arm for the second time, or who has gained considerable skill in the art of dis- secting and of recognising various structures, may now dissect the axilla from below, thus gaining an idea of the relations and to some extent the appearance of the parts as they arc in the living body. For the beginner, however, experience teaches that this is not advisable, since the dissection has to be carried on in a cramped space and with little light. It is far better to reflect the pectoral muscles, turning them aside and replacing them from time to time so as to restore the original boundaries of the axilla. First cut the clavicular

THE PELVIS Before beginning the dissection of the pelvis the student should revise what he has already learned in connection with the part. Turn the pelvis upside down and examine the perineum with the urethra, corpus spongiosum and anal canal or urethra, vagina and anal canal, according to sex, centrally ; the ischio-rectal fossa and its various contents and relations' laterally. Observe again how the levator ani muscle limits the ischio-rectal fossa above and internally; how it passes downwards and inwards from the lateral wall of the pelvis to be inserted into the middle line, its fibres surround- ing the prostate anteriorly, the ahmentary canal posteriorly. If it be possible, in the median line, re-identify the dorsal vein. Now restore the pelvis to its normal position and examine it and its contents from above, so far as the latter can be seen at present through the overlying peritoneum. The pelvic colon and rectum can be readily recognised at the back, lying in front of the sacrum. The Pelvic Colon should be examined very carefully, and the student will be well advised if he takes every oppor- tunity of observing this structure in other bodies, for it varies greatly both in length and arrangement. The iliac colon was traced as far as the inner margin of the left psoas (p. 130), and here the pelvic colon begms. It usually ends opposite the third piece of the sacrum, but between these two points it may take a straight course if it is very short or may form a loop Hke a U turned on its side,

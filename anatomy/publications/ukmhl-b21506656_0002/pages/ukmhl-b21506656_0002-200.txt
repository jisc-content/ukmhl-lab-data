188 PRACTICAL ANATOMY is not at all an unusual thing to find the branches of the lumbar as well as of the sacral plexus rising higher or lower than usual. In the former case the plexus is said to be " prefixed," in the latter " postfixed." Fig. 270.â€”Lumbar Plexus from in froxt. 1 2, 3, 4, 5. Corresponding Lumbar Nerves. I.E.

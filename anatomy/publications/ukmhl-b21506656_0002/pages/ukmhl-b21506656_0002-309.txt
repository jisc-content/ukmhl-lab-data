297 THE FOREARM septum, and should be traced round the back of the humerus as a vascular arch deep to the triceps tendon, and a little above the attachment of the posterior part of the capsule of the elbow. The anterior branch, when well injected, may be followed down in front of the internal condyle, where it anastomoses with the anterior ulnar recurrent artery. A fairly common abnormality of the brachial artery is a hisfh division into radial and ulnar. It is met with often enough to be of direct practical interest to the surgeon. A high radial is more frequent than a high ulnar, and if there is any doubt as to which is the high branch, the origin of the common interosseous is a test, for this always rises from the main arterial stem. THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM Skin Incisions.—The surface anatomy is so easily studied on the dissector's own forearm that the most practical method is to display the superficial structures on the " part," and then to notice their position and surface markings on the living forearm. Make a vertical incision down the middle of the front of the forearm as far as the lower crease in front of the wrist. Then make a transverse incision along this crease and reflect the two flaps of skin. SuPEKFiciAL Structures.—r/ie anterior branch of the musGulo-Gutaneous nerve should be followed down as far as the lower end of the exposed area, whence it passes on to the ball of the thumb. It gives off numerous twigs supplying the radial side of the front of the forearm. The anterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve should be followed on from where it was left in the arm. It will be found to supply the inner side of the front of the fore- arm ; but it does not reach the hand as the external cuta- neous does. Sometimes a superficial branch of the ulnar nerve pierces the deep fascia on the inner side of the forearm and communicates with the internal cutaneous.

THE ABDOMINAL WALL 85 labium majus. If the internal oblique is now carefully re- flected downwards, the transversalis will be exposed, and can be seen to arise from the outer third of Poupart's ligament, and to pass downwards and inwards to fuse with the internal oblique forming the conjoined tendon [falx inguinalis], and so to gain an insertion into the ilio-pectineal line. The transversalis is inserted into slightly more of the line than is the internal oblique. Below the lower arched borders of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and above Fig. 227.â€”Dissection of the Inguinal Region. E.O. External Oblique. I.O. Internal Oblique. Tr. Transversalis. P.L. Poupart's Ligament. Crem. Cremaster. Sp.C. Spermatic Cord. Poupart's ligament, the somewhat oval area of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is formed by the transversalis fascia, which is thicker here than elsewhere. Below the lower border of the transversalis and deep to the internal oblique the fascia is evaginated along the spermatic cord like the finger of a glove, and is known as the infundihidi- form or internal t^permatic fascia. The point of evagination is the internal abdominal ring [annulus inguinalis abdomi- nalis], and is situated half an inch above Poupart's ligament

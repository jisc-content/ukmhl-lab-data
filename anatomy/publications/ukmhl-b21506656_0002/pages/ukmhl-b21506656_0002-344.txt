332 PKACTICAL ANATOMY Arteria Radiulis Indicin, running along the radial border of the index, and often completing the superficial palmar arch by a lateral anastomosis. First Palmar Interosseous, which runs not in the first but in the second intermetacarpal space, and joins the digital artery from the superficial palmar arch, as has already been seen. After the deep arch has passed between the two adductors of the thumb, it gives off its secoiid and third palmar H.Mm. 4th.L. Min.

Accompanying the deep palmar arch is the Dee2y Branch of the Ulnar Nerve, which has already been seen dipping down between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti when both these muscles are present; it then runs through the origin of the opponens minimi digiti, often grooving the hook of the unciform.

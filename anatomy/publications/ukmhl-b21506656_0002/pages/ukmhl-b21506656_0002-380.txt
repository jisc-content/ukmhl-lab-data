PRACTICAL ANATOMY 368 in not being intriicapsular, Wlien the finger is flexed the glenoid ligament slides in front of the head of the metacarpal, puckering very little, whereas the rest of the palmar ligament puckers very much. It has already been seen that the four glenoid ligaments are connected by the deep transverse meta- carpal ligaments [ligg. capitulorum transversa]. The dorsal part of the capsule is very thin, while the lateral ligaments riigg. collateralia] are strong and fan-shaped, the apex of the fan being attached to the side of the head of the metacarpal bone palmar to the tubercle. Move the fingers of your own hand, and notice that these joints are typically condyloid, allowing flexion, extension, abduction and adduction. Extension, as a rule, cannot be carried beyond a straight Hne with the hand unless the fingers are forcibly pulled back. This is sometimes known as hyper-extension, and varies in degree in diSerent people; it is generally more free in the index and minimus. The Metacarpo-phalangeal Joint of the Thumb differs from the foregoing in having two sesamoid bones embedded in the glenoid ligament; there is also so little lateral movement that it is almost a hinge. The amount of flexion varies in different individuals, some being able to flex this joint to a right angle, others only to 20Â°. The double-jointed thumb, which is fairly common, is a subluxation backward apparently connected with lax lateral ligaments, though we are not aware that the opportunity has ever occurred of dissecting a specimen. The Interphalangeal Joints closely resemble the metacarpo-phalangeal except in their trochlear jomt surfaces and the absence of any lateral movement. They have a glenoid palmar ligament, an almost negligible dorsal, and very strong lateral ligaments. They are perhaps the most perfect hinge joints in the body.

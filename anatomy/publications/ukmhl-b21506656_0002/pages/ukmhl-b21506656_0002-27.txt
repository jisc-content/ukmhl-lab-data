Passing downwards and to the left from this groove another similar groove will be seen dividing the ventricular portion of the heart into, as seen from the front, a larger right and a smaller left portion; this groove corresponds to a septum between the two ventricles, and is known as the anterior interventri- cular groove [sulcus longitudinaHs anterior]. The division of the auricular portion of the heart into right and left com- P1.S. P:V. S.O. p.v. Fig. 196.â€”Diagrammatic Scheme of the Pericardial AND Pleural Sacs. P.S. Pericardial Sac. Pl.S.

Opening into the right side of the auricular portion will be seen two large vessels, one of which passes downwards, the other upwards; they are the superior and inferior venae cavaj. These can be made more evident by gently pulling the heart to the left. They are usually full of blood clot. If the free portion of the heart be now Ufted upwards, a number of large vessels will be seen opening into the left

THE SUPRARENALS 167 for some of a brighter red colour than the rest. These are the hcemolymph nodes, apparently transitional structures between the spleen and ordmary lymphatic nodes. The anterior aspect of the kidneys and suprarenal bodies should be examined next. Notice that the right suprarenal body is triangular, while the left is crescentic ; that the right is in contact with the liver, except near its inner (medial) margin, where it lies behind the inferior vena cava; that the left is in contact with the stomach above and with the pahcreas below (see Fig. 261). Each capsule will be seen to be partly covered by perito- neum anteriorly; thus, on the right side, there is peritoneum covering the lower part of the hepatic area, but none in fi-ont of the upper part or of the caval strip. On the left side there is peritoneum of the lesser sac between the supra- renal and the stomach, but none between the gland and the pancreas. Each suprarenal has a slit-like hilum on its anterior surface through which the capsular vein comes out. The arteries enter at various points. The anterior surface of the right kidney is in relation to the liver above, to the hepatic flexure of the colon below, and to the second part of the duodenum near the hilum. Its lower pole was seen to be crossed by the ascending branch of the right colic artery. With the exception of its inner and lower part, it is covered by peritoneum (see Fig. 262). The left kidney has in front of it the stomach above, the spleen externally, the pancreas transversely across from the hilum to the splenic area, the splenic flexure of the colon below that, while the lower pole is in contact with coils of jejunum and is crossed by the ascending branch of the left colic artery. Now divide the aorta just below the diaphragm (taking care not to injure the receptaculum chyli, which lies behind and to the right of it) and again just above the origin of the

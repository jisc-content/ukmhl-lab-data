THE PERINEUM 101 posterioris]—on the outer side of them. This has been seen in the dissection of the gluteal region, and is a branch of the small sciatic ; it winds round the back of the origins of the hamstring muscles an inch below the tuber ischii, but, since the thigh is now amputated, it is probably cut and only its anterior end will be found. It will now be realised that there are three nerves running forward on each side towards the scrotum, the two superficial perineal and the inferior pudendal, which are often known collectively as the three long scrotal nerves. The next branch of the pudic nerve on a deeper plane is the deep perineal [n. perinei], accompanying the internal pudic artery forwards in a canal formed by the splitting of the obturator internus fascia known as Alcock's canal. This nerve lies just below (superficial to) the artery (see Fig. 233 D.P.N.). The fourth and deepest branch of the pudic nerve is the dm'sal nerve of the penis or clitoris; this will be found in Alcock's canal above (deep to) the pudic artery. By the time these structures have been found, the space will be largely cleared of fat, and a little more cleaning will show that the inner wall of the pyramidal fossa is formed by the levator ani muscle, sloping downwards and inwards, and ' the external sphincter ani, surrounding the anal canal and attached posteriorly to the tip of the coccyx, and anteriorly to the central point of the perineum where the anterior skin incision was made. It derives its nerve supply from two sources, one nerve entering behind—a twig from the perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve; the other from the side a branch from the inferior hsemorrhoidal nerve. These nerves should be found and preserved. The posterior wall of the ischio-rectal fossa is formed by the gluteus maximus muscle and great sacro-sciatic liga- ment; It will be remembered that the origin of the muscle was detached from the ligament in the dissection of the buttock.

88 PEACTICAL ANATOMY lages the fleshy fibres of the transversahs He behind the rectus muscle. Now look at the linea alba, where the two sheaths jom, and notice how wide it is above the umbihcus, how narrow below. Notice, too, the firm fibrous ring sur- rounding the umbilicus [annulus umbilicalis], a ring so dense that true umbilical hernia is very rare indeed, and most of the " ruptures" in this region are outside the ring. THE PENIS AND SCROTUM Surface Anatomy.—The prepuce should be pulled back, uncovering the glans penis, the base of which—the cm^ona glandis—\& sharply separated from the body of the penis. The downward and forward obliquity of the corona should be noted, also the frenum preputii, or fold of skin below the glans, and the external urinary meatus. The skin of the penis' is thin, free from hair, and but loosely attached to underlying structures. The skin of the scrotum is a little thicker and possessed of spare hairs. A close inspection of the under surface of the penis and scrotum will disclose a median raphe. By deep pressure along the penis it may be possible to discover that it is formed of three rod-hke parts, so arranged that two are dorsal and one mesial and ventral. The two''former are the corpora cavernosa, and end at the corona glandis; the last, the corpus spongiosum, is con- tinuous with the glans. A catheter should now be passed through the external urinary meatus along the urethra to the bladder. In pass- ing the catheter the student should stand to the left of the cadaver The penis is pulled forward and the pomt of the catheter passed through the meatus, the catheter bemg held parallel to Poupart's hgament. The catheter should be allowed to glide by its own weight as far as what will after- wards be found to be the triangular ligament, the handle ot the catheter moving inwards until it occupies the middle line At the triangular hgament a good deal of manipula-

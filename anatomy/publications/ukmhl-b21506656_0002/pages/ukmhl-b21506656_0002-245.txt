233 NERVES OE THE PELVIS the slips of origin of the pyriformis between them. Each nerve communicates with the adjacent sympathetic ganglion by a grey ramus communicans. The white rami communi- cantes, although they are present from the second and third or third and fourth sacral nerves, do not pass through the sympathetic ganglia, but go direct to the pelvic plexuses. The first, second, and third sacral nerves, together with the lumbo-sacral cord, join to form the great sciatic nerve which passes out of the great sciatic notch in front of and below the pyriformis. By careful dissection the nerves to the obturator internus and quadratus femoris may be found rising from the anterior surfaces of the nerves forming the great sciatic. The best way of finding them is to pull on the stumps left in the dis- section of the gluteal region. The fourth sacral nerve forms a loop with the lower part of the third sacral, from which ttoigs to the levator ani, coccygeus, and external sphincter ani may be traced with care, the latter nerve being followed through the coccygeus muscle and great sacro-sciatic.ligament. By dissecting carefully along the side of the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx the fifth sacral and the coccygeal nerve will be found ; they join a branch of the fourth sacral, and supply the skin in the immediate neighbourhood of the coccyx as the sacro-coccygeal nerve. So far the great sciatic, superior gluteal, and sacro- coccygeal nerves, as well as twigs to the obturator internus, quadratus femoris, levator ani, coccygeus, and external sphmcter, are the branches found, but there are still the begmnings of the inferior gluteal, smaU sciatic, and pudic nerves to seek. Find the cut ends of these, if possible, in the gluteal region, and notice that with the exception of the pudic they are superficial to (behind) the great sciatic. Their pelvic origms therefore are behind the great sciatic, and, in order to see them, either the great sciatic nerve should be pulled

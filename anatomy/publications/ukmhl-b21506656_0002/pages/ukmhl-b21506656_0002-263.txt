251 THE PECTORAL REGION Rodect the large flap, thus marked out, downwards and outwards, when the pectoral region and lower part of the axilla will be exposed. Superficial Structures The upper part of the chest is supplied by the superficial descending branches of the cervical plexus; these are in three sets, all of which pass superficial to the clavicle, and are most easily found as they are crossing it. The largest of the three is the supra-acromial, which should be looked for over the outer third of the clavicle; once found, its twigs may be traced down to the level of the middle of the deltoid. The supra-clavicular should be picked up over the middle of the clavicle, while the supra-sternal branch is the smallest and is often represented by some of the inner twigs of the last; it winds round the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and crosses the inner end of the clavicle close to the sterno-clavicular articulation. In exposing these nerves the lower fibres of the thin subcutaneous platysma muscle will have to be cleared away. Now dissect away the superficial fascia covering the origin of the pectoralis major close to the outer edge of the sternum, and look very carefully in each intercostal space for the anterior cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. Their position is indicated by the small perforating branches of the internal mammary artery which accompany them. lu the female it will be noticed that they supply the median part of the mammary gland. The lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves must be looked for near aline running down from the middle of the axilla, but before looking for them the arm should be abducted and fastened out on a board. Before piercing the muscle they divide into anterior and posterior branches, which supply the skin of the side of the

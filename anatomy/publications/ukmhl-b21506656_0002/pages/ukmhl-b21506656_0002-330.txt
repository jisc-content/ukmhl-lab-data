318 PRACTICAL ANATOMY ihe palm to the base of the middle finger, after wliich a transverse incision at right angles to its lower end will allow two flaps of skin to be reflected and turned aside. The superficial fascia of the palm consists of a quantity of granular fat, the granules being separated by fibrous tissue; where the creases on the surface of the palm occur the skin is bound tightly to the deep palmar fascia. On the ball of the thumb {tlienar eminence) and ball of the little finger (hypothenar eminence) the fat is not so plentiful or so granular. In the webs of the fingers some transverse fibres run which are usually spoken of as the su2)erjicial transveme ligament. Care must be taken not to confuse this with the superficial transverse metacarpal ligament, which will be exposed later. Trace the palmar cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves as far as you can in this fascia, and on the ball of the thumb look for twigs of the musculo- cutaneous, radial and palmar cutaneous of the median. Among the superficial fat of the hypothenar eminence look for the palmaris hrevis muscle, a thin sheet of fleshy fibres running transversely from the deep palmar fascia to the skin on the inner margin of the palm (see Fig. 310). Place your own palm in the attitude with which you would use it to scoop up water, and notice how the skin over the hypothenar eminence is thrown into wrinklesâ€”this is due to the action of the palmaris brevis. Clear away the superficial fat and expose the deep palmar fascia, which con- sists of a central and two lateral parts. The lateral 'parts of the Deep Palmar Fascia cover the muscles forming the thenar and hypothenar eminences, and in order to see the latter part the palmaris brevis must be reflected. In doing this take care not to injure the ulnar artery and nerve, which lie very close to its deep surface. It will now be seen that the lateral parts of the deep fascia are quite thin and unimportant.

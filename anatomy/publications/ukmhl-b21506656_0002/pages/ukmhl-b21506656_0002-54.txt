PRACTICAL ANATOMY 42 Sponge the parietal pleura carefully, but do not cut through it at present. On the left side the great convexity of the arch of the aorta [arcus aortoe] will be very evident. Notice that this runs as much backwards as it does to the left, and that it corresponds in level to the lower half of the manubrium sterni in front, and to the body of the fourth thoracic ver- tebra behind. Springing from the top of the aortic arch the left sub- clavian artery will be seen arching upwards above and in front of the dome of the pleura; it makes a most prominent ridge behind which the oesophagus will be felt. The thoracic duct cannot be either seen or felt, but if an incision is made through the pleura just behind and parallel with the ridge formed by the left subclavian artery, the duct will be found quite easily. The left carotid artery seldom forms an elevation as the left subclavian does, but it may easily be felt, lying against the pleura, in front and to the right of that vessel. Nearer still to the middle line and still more anteriorly, the innominate artery will be felt on deep pressure (see Fig. 213). The outlines of the left phrenic and vagus nerves are to be made out through the pleura, gradually diverging as they go down, so that the former may pass in front of and the latter behind the root of the lung. As one passes from right to left in front of the upper part of the aortic arch, the left superior intercostal vein is easily seen through the pleura; after passing in front of the left vagus, it turns rather sharply upwards to open into the left innominate vein. Below the aorta, in its concavity, notice the pulmonary artery while, above, the left innominate vein may just be felt and seen lying, as it does, behind the upper half of the manubrium sterni. On the right side the upper half of the superior vena cava is in the superior mediastinum, as is also the arch of

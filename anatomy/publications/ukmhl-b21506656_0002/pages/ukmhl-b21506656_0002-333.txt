THE PALM 321 into the outer side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. Divide these two muscles, and turn them aside, when the opponcns pollicis will be exposed. This has practically the same origin as the flexor brevis, but differs from it in iDeing inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. It is usually easily separable into a superficial and a deep lamina. The nerve to these three muscles will easily be found on reflecting the superficial ones, and may be traced to the median. The Muscles of the Hypothenar Eminence, when they are normal, are quite symmetrical with those of the thenar eminence, and consist of abductor, flexor brevis, and opponens minimi digiti. Here a word of caution as to the deficiencies of our nomenclature is necessary. Up to the present an abductor has meant a muscle which draws the part on which it acts away from the middle hne of the body, while an adductor draws it towards that line. In the hand and foot, however, the mid line of the body is ignored, and the mid line of the extremity is used. In the hand this line passes through the middle finger, so that the abductor minimi digiti draws the little finger away from the mid line of the hand, but towards that of the body. In order to expose these muscles clear away the deep fascia. The Abductor Minimi Digiti [m. abductor digiti quinti] rises from the pisiform bone, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the proximal phalanx. As in the thumb, a slight expansion passes back to the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the finger. This muscle is sometimes double. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti [m. flexor digiti quinti brevis] lies lateral to the abductor, and rises from the hook of the unciform and the anterior annular ligament. Like the abductor, it is inserted into the inner side of the base of the proximal phalanx. It is often absent, and when this VOL. n. V

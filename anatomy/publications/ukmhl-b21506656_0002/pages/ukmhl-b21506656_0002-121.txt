109 THE PERINEUM r^(f/a', which disappear to a considerable extent after child- birth. At the upper part of the anterior wall of the vagina look for the OS luteri, a transverse slit usually from a quarter to half an incli in length; it will be examined more carefully with the uterus later. The urethral orifice (Fig. 236, U.) should be noticed with great care; it lies just above the vaginal orifice and an inch below the tip of the chtoris. The opening usually pouts a little, so that it may be felt by the finger, and on either side of it there is a small para-urethral pocket which may snare the point of the catheter. It is well to practise passing a catheter by touch alone, and, in order to do this, put the index finger within the vaginal orifice with its palmar side towards the symphysis, then slide the catheter along this, keeping it exactly in the middle line, when, with a little manipulation, the point should slip into the urethra. One of the most characteristic things about the female urethra is its extreme distensibility; this, of course, is masked by formalin, but in a fresh subject the handle of a scalpel can be easily passed into the bladder. The hulhs of the vestibule (see Fig. 236, B.V.) are masses of erectile tissue resting one on either side against the orifice of the vagina, and covered by a thin layer of muscleâ€”the S'pltincter vagince (Fig. 236, S.V.M.) corresponding to the bulbo-cavernosus of the male. Each bulb of the vestibule is the equivalent of half the bulb in the male, and above the vaginal orifice they coalesce and are continued into the chtoris by a narrow strip of erectile tissue known as the pars intermedia.. Bartholin's glands [Gl. vestibularis majores] (Fig. 236, E.G.) should be looked for, one on either side, overlapped by the lower or posterior end of the bulb of the vestibule; each is like a very small kidney bean, and has a delicate duct which opens into the vestibule at the side of the orifice of

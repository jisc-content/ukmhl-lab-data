THE AXILLA 2b5 The lower sxibscapular nerve supplies the teres major, and sends a branch to the lower border of the subscapularis. It lies outside the long subscapular, nearer the axillary vessels, and is close to the dorsalis scapulee branch of the subscapular artery. As the lower border of the subscapularis is cleaned, toward the humerus it will come into view. The internal relations of the second part of the axillary artery are the axillary vein, the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and the internal anterior thoracic nerve. Notice that the vein, accompanied by its chaui of small lymphatic nodes, hes quite on the inner side of the artery now, and does not overlap it in front, as it did in the first part of the artery's course. The external relations of the second part of the axillary artery are the coracoid process, a httle distance away, and the outer cord of the brachial plexus. It will be noticed that in the second part of the artery the three cords lie each on its own aspect of the artery. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery are the long and alar thoracic. The long thoracic has already been traced along the lower border of the pectoralis minor, while the alar thoracic is any small artery or arteries supply- ing the lymphatic nodes and cellular tissue, whether it rises from the axillary direct or from some of its branches. The third part of the axillary artery runs from the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the lower border of the teres major. A glance at it, when the pectoralis minor is replaced, shows that it is more than twice as long as the other two parts put together. The anterior relations of the third part of the axillary artery are:— Bones.—None. Muscles.—Pectoralis major. Fibrous Structures.—The deep fascia of the arm, gradually disappearing in the axillary cellular tissue. Arteries.—None.

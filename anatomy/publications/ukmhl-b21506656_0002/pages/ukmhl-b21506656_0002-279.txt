THE AXILLA 267 space described later. It does not pass in front of the latissi- mus dorsi and teres major, a fact which distinguishes it at once from the musculo-spiral. When it is missed, it is usually because it is not looked for high enough m the axilla. Tlie internal relations of the third 'part of the axiUary artery are: (1) The formation of the axillary vein by the union of the vensfi comites and the basilic vein; these have aheady been noticed (see p. 263) ; (2) the terminal branches of the inner cord of the brachial plexus, namely, the internal cutaneous, the ulnar, and the lesser internal cutaneous nerves. The internal cutaneous [n. cutaneus antibrachn medi- alis] is a comparatively small nerve lying in the groove be- tween the axillary artery and vein, when the latter is formed. The ulnar nerve is larger than the internal cutaneous and Hes behind it, also between the artery and vein. The lesser internal cutaneous nerve [n. cutaneus brachii medialis] is quite small and crosses behind the vein to lie on its inner side, where it should be looked for. This nerve, the only branch of the brachial plexus internal to the vein, usually communicates with the intercosto - humeral, the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve, and so the two may vary inversely in size. Sometimes even the intercosto-humeral may entirely replace the lesser internal cutaneous. The external relations of the third part of the axillary artery are the coraco-brachialis muscle and the terminal branches of the outer cord of the plexus, namely, the musculo- cutaneous and outer head of the median nerves. In addition to these the upper part of the shaft of the humerus, although not in direct relationship, is so near that the artery during life may easily be compressed against it. The musculo-cutaneous nerve is easily distinguished, because it pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle opposite the lower border of the teres major. Some distance before this

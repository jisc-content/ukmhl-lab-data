THE HEART 29 pulmonary artery. If the exterior of the two large vessels be now studied at the site of the semilunar valves a slight bulging, the sinus of Valsalva, may be observed correspond- ing to each valve. From the anterior and left posterior aortic sinuses the right and left coronary arteries arise; these pass forwards, one on either side of the pulmonary Fig. 203.â€”Diagram to .show the Position of the Valves OP THE Heart.

The right coronary artery should be traced along the ricfht auriculo-ventricular sulcus to the back of the heart until it reaches the beginning of the posterior interven- tricular groove. Along this it sends a well-marked inter- ventricular branch. The left coronary artery soon reaches the anterior interventricular sulcus, along which it send^*

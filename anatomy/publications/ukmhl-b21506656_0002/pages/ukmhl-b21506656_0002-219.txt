BLOOD VESSELS OF THE PELVIS 207 the root of the pelvis for about inch, until the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic notch is reached. It hes just above and behind the ureter when the body is erect (see Fig. 276), and its vein is behind and mternal. At this point it divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior division is chiefly concerned with the supply of the pelvic viscera, and the first branch to be looked for is the sioperior vesical, which reaches the bladder through the posterior false ligaments, and, when it comes in contact with the vas deferens, gives off the small deferential artery. The inferior vesical comes off quite close to the last, or by a common trunk with it, and supplies the ampulla of the vas deferens and vesicula seminalis. Both these branches are in close relation to the end of the ureter, and give small twigs to it. The middle hcemorrhoidal is always closely associated at its origin with the vesical branches; it usually enters the side of the rectum about the level of the base of the prostate, and gives several branches to this gland. It is important to realise that the obliterated hypogastric artery is the real continuation of the internal iliac, and that, strictly speaking, all the pelvic branches come from that stem. In the foetus this artery forms a downwardly-directed loop from the bifurcation of the common iliac to the umbilicus, and it is from the downward convexity of this loop that all the pelvic branches spring. The vesical and middle hasmorrhoidal arteries, which are dissected first, are really the last branches given off by the hypogastric on its way to the umbilicus, and when the umbilical cord is tied in the foetus the artery becomes obliterated from the umbilicus to the point of origin of the superior vesical artery. This obliterated hypogastric artery is very evident in the adult running along the side of the pelvis towards the anterior abdominal wall.

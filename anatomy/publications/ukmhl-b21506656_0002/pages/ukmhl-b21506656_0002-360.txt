PRACTICAL ANATOMY 348 In this space arc found the beginning of the radial vein most superficially, then some twigs of the radial nerve, while most deeply is the second part of the radial artery, which is sometimes tied here. The extensor indiois [M.E.I, proprius] is the lowest muscle rising from the posterior surface of the ulna. In order to see it fully, cut the posterior annular ligament where it is binding down the extensor communis digitorum, and turn these tendons farther down over the fingers. It will now be seen that the extensor indiois passes through the same compartment of the ligament as the extensor com- munis digitorum, and that it joins the index slip of the latter muscle on its ulnar side before the dorsal expansion begins. Now follow the course of the posterior interosseous artery at the back of the forearm. After passing between the two bones, it appears in the interval between the lower edge of the supinator brevis and the upper edge of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. It then runs down the forearm between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, and close to the twigs of the posterior interosseous nerve. When it first appears it gives off the posterior interosseous recurrent branch, which runs upwards superficial to the supinator brevis, and deep to the anconeus, to join the anastomosis round the olecranon already noticed. It is necessary to cut and reflect the anconeus in order to follow this branch. In its course the posterior interosseous artery supphes the muscles of the back of the forearm, and, since it has no help, it is used up by the time the lower third is reached. The deficiency in the lower third of the forearm is made good by the posterior branch of the anterior interosseous a/rtery, which was seen perforating the interosseous mem- brane when the front of the forearm was dissected (see p. 314). In order to trace it at' the back, cut and reflect

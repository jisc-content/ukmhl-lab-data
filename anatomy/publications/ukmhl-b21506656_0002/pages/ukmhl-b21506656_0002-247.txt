235 THE PELVIS inwards through the sacro-sciatic foramen so that its pos- terior surface may be seen, or the pyriformis cut away and the back of the plexus dissected through the foramen. Now the nerves in question will be visible, and the inferior gluteal omnie may usually be traced to the lumbo-sacral cord, first and second sacral nerves, the small sciatic to the first, second, and third, and the pudie [n. pudendus] to the second, third, and fourth. The 'perforating cutaneous nerve is not always present, but when it is it will be found piercing the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and may be traced to the' second and third sacral nerves. It is usual to speak of the small sciatic, pudic, perforating cutaneous, muscular to the pelvic floor and visceral nerves (white rami communicantes from 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 sacral nerves) as constituting a plexus subsidiary to the sacral and known as the Pudendal Plexus. Ligaments and Articulations of the Pelvis When everything else has been dissected, put what is left of the pelvis into a vessel of water for a night, and then clean away all the soft parts except the ligaments. The Sacro-iliac joint has anterior and posterior ligaments, though their real positions in the upright body would be more accurately described as inferior and superior. The anterior ligament is thin, being in striking contrast with the posterior, which is both thick and' strong, and spreads itself over the bones at some distance from the articular surfaces. In order to appreciate the importance of these posterior sacro-ihac ligaments, it must be realised that they play the part of the chains in a suspension bridge, shnging the sacrum, which represents the bridge, from the upright piers or iha.' Passing from the transverse process of the 5th lumbar vertebra downwards to the front of the sacro-iliac capsule is

28 PRACTICAL ANATOMY Now treat the parts on the left side in a similar fashion. Pass a finger from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta, and then, turning the pulmonary artery and infundibulum aside, with a pair of scissors slit open the aorta, cutting again, if possible, between the semilunar cusps.

They are, however, arranged so that one is situated in front, the other two behind. They mark the beginning of the aorta. It will now be understood that, despite appearances, the aorta begins at a slightly lower level and somewhat nearer the median plane than does the

75 THE ABDOMEN border. This procedure will show that in front of the erector spinae there exists another strong fascia, the middle layer of kimbar fascia. This second fascia should now be divided in the same vertical line as was the first, when the quadratus homborum rnuscle will come into view; while if it, in its turn, is pushed ixaward in the same way as was the erector spinse, a third fascia will appear. If these three fasciae be now traced outward, it will be found that the posterior and middle unite with each other at the outer border of the erector spinse and with the anterior at the outer border of the quadratus lumborum. The lumbar fascia may therefore be regarded as constituted of three lamellae—anterior, middle, and posterior. Outward beyond their fusion they are con- tinued into the internal oblique and transversaUs muscles; internally they are attached respectively to the front of the transverse processes, the tips of the transverse process, and to the tips of the spines of the lumbar vertebrae; the last two attachments can be easily seen, while the first can at this stage be only indefinitely felt. Now divide the lumbar fascia and transversalis muscle in the same line as were divided the latissimus dorsi, the external and internal obhque muscles. This incision necessarily divides a thin underlying fascia—the fascia transversalis, which is partly the sheath of the transversalis muscle, partly condensed extra-peritoneal tissue, and alto- gether neghgible for practical purposes. Reflect the lumbar fascia up and down, and, if it can be seen, divide the fascia transversahs by which the scalpel will enter the extra-peritoneal tissue, which contains a variable amount of fat and is traversed in this region by the three nerves mentioned above before they come to he between the transversalis and internal oblique muscles. Search should be made by the finger in this fat for the lower pole of the kidney, and immediately to the outer side of this the ascending colon on the right side, the descendin<r colon on the left side, may be easily felt, and can be pulled

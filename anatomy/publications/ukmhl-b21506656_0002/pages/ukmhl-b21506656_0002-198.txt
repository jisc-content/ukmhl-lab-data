186 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The student should now examine a small Lvmho Sacral Triangle, bounded below by the ala of the sacrum, internally by the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and externally by the inner border (if the psoas. Crossing the triangle will be found the common iliac vessels, while immediately posterior to them the lurnbar sympathetic cord descends into the pelvis. Deep in the triangle and imbedded in a considerable amount of fat lie; certain common iliac lymphatic nodes, the obturator nerve, the lumbo-sacral cord, and the ilio-lumbar vessels. The latter vessels will be found running upwards and outwards between the obturator nerve and lumbo-sacral cord (see Fig. 269). The Muscles of the Posterioe Abdominal Wall The Psoas [P. major] is a long pyriform muscle arising from the body of the last thoracic, the bodies and transverse processes of the five lumbar vertebrae and from the fibrous arches which bridge over the lumbar vessels. It can be seen at present passing down in front of the posterior part of the iliac crest, below which it is joined laterally by the iliacus. In the majority of cases a small muscle with a long tendon, the Psoas parvus [P. minor], passes down in front of and close to the inner border of the psoas muscle. It arises from the adjacent portions of the bodies of the last thoracic and 1st lumbar vertebrae and the intervening disc. Below it blends with the fascia covering the psoas, accounting for the increased strength of the fascia there. It can in many cases be traced to an insertion into the ilio-pectineal eminence. The Quadratus Lumhorum is formed of two sets of fibres, some passing from the iliac crest to the transverse processes of certain lumbar vertebrae, others passing from_ the same or other lumbar transverse processes to the last rib. Its outer border is directed upwards and inwards, and almost coin- cides in position with the outer border of the erector spinas muscle.

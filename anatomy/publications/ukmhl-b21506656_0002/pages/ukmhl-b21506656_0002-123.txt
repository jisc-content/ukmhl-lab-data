111 THE PERITONEUM as the ti/rachus. The deep surface of both flaps is hned by a glistening serous membrane—the parietal peritoneum. A similar membrane—the visceral peritoneum—covers the viscera exposed. A httle manipulation will show that laterally these two membranes are continuous with each other. Now, holding the palm of the hand upwards, pass the index and middle fingers of the left hand—one on either side of the mid hne—upwards behind the upper part of the anterior abdominal wall. A little movement from side to side will demonstrate the existence of a thin vertical sheet of peritoneum passing upwards, backwards, and to the right from the median line. This is the falciform ligament of the liver. With a pair of strong scissors cut upwards on either side of this ligament as far as is possible, taking care not to injure underlying structures with the point of the scissors. The two resulting triangular flaps may next be turned up, and are seen to be hned with the parietal peritoneum. The four fiaps should be hooked back, thereby exposing the whole of the peritoneal cavity and its contents. The Peritoneum Before proceeding to the study of the peritoneum in detail, there are certain general facts in regard to it which must be realised. First imagine it as a thin membrane hning a simple cavity; then as a membrane which, in addition to hning such a cavity, is reflected without loss of continuity over various structures which are developed immediately without the membrane and project more or less completely into the cavity. In consequence of this we can distinguish a parietal Liyer of peritoneum lining the cavity and a viscer-al layer reflected over the viscera. In certain cases the viscus is entirely covered by peritoneum, except along a narrow linear

110 PRACTICAL ANATOMY Llie vagina and just internal to the labium minus. The gland represents Cowper's gland in the male. Now dissect away the labia, and expose the clitoris. This is the homologue of the glans and corpora cavernosa penis. Its body (Fig. 236, CI.) is about an inch long, having a small pointed glans at the tip, which is not perforated by the urethra. Dissect out the crura clitoridis (Fig. 236, C.Cl.) corresponding to the crura penis, but of smaller size, and covered by a small ischio-cavernosus muscle (Fig. 236,1.C.M.). The transversus perinei muscle (Fig. 236, T.P.M.) in the female corresponds, when present, Avith that of the male in its attachments. If the labia minora are regarded as the split floor of the male penile urethra, it will be seen from the foregoing that all the parts of the male genital apparatus are presdnt in the female, though they usually retain the foital arrangement and fail to fuse in the mid hne below. The superficial layer of the triangular ligament is present in the female deep to the crura clitoridis; it is, however, difficult to recognise, being deeply notched by the orifice of the vagina, ■ ABDOMINAL CAVITY The anterior wall of the abdomen having been dissected, the student should now proceed to the study of the abdominal cavity and its contents. Make a vertical incision close to but not quite m the mid hne from the level of the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis. Through the upper limit of this incision carry another incision transversely across the abdomen from one side to the other. Now turn the two resulting triangular flaps downwards, and note that, occupying the median line, ie on the median edge of the larger flap, there is a some- what indistinct fibrous cord which, beginning at the umbihcus, can be traced down to the pelvis, where it will later be seen to be continuous with the apex of the bladder—it is known

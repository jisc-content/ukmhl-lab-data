THE AETERIES OF THE HAND 351 the styloid process of the radius. Here the second part l)es^ins, and the artery now runs backwards and downwards deep to the tendons of the extensor ossis nietacarpi and extensor brevis polHcis. In doing so it has entered the "anatomical snuff-box" ah-eady noticed. Cut and reflect these two tendons, and notice that the artery is now curving round the outer side and back of the trapezium. Especially notice how close it is to the carpo-nietacarpal joint of the thumb, and how carefully it must be avoided in amputation at this joint. The radial vein and nerve, which here lie D.P.A. PI A.

Replace the tendon of the extensor longus pollicis in its groove, and notice that, immediately after passing deep to it, the artery pierces the origin of the first dorsal interosseous muscle between the bases of the first two metacarpal bones. Bearing these points in mind, the surface markings of this part of the artery are easily worked out. Take a point on the outer side of the flexor carpi radialis tendon at the level of the tip of the styloid process of the radius, then feel for the bases of the first and second metacarpal bones just

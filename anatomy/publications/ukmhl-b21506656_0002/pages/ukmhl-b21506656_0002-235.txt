223 THE FEMALE PELVIS is not unusual, on the right side, to find the vermiform appendix lying in contact with the front of the ovary. To map out the ovary on the anterior abdominal wall join the anterior superior iliac spine to the spine of the opposite pubis, and bisect this line. The ovary lies three or four inches directly behind this point. The Fallopian tube runs at first outwards and then turns upwards along the antero - external border of the ovary, where the latter organ is attached to the broad liga- ment by the fold known as the mesovarium. On reaching the top of the ovary, which is known as the tubal pole, the tube turns backwards and inwards and ends in its fimbriated extremity. It will thus be seen that the normal ovary has one surface looking forwards and inwards towards the bladder, and another backwards and outwards against the pelvic wall. One border is forwards and outwards in contact with the Fallopian tube, and another backwards and inwards looking towards the rectum (see Fig. 284). The upper end or tubal pole receives the ovarian vessels, and is in contact with the fimbriated extremity of the tube, while the lower end or uterine pole is attached by the liga- ment of the ovary to the uterus. The pelvic floor will be seen to be formed in a similar way to that already described in speaking of the male pelvis, viz. by the coccygeus and levatores ani muscles. The latter muscle has a large aperture in its anterior portion for the passage of the vagina, its anterior fibres being sometimes known as the levator vagince muscle. By drawing the viscera to one side it is usually possible to expose the pelvic floor and the side of the vagina, and it is well for the student to accustom himself as far as may be to the conditions he may have to face later on in the living body. If, however, more room is absolutely necessary, it may be obtained by removino- one side of the pelvic wall as directed on p. 230. * By this procedure good access will be gained to the

266 PRACTICAL ANATOMY Yeins.—The external vena comes crossing to help form the axillary vein. Nerves.—Inner head of the median, sometimes double. Glandula/r and other 8tructv/res.—The lower lymphatics of the chain accompanying the axillary vessels. These, as has been pointed out, are more closely in touch with the vein than with the artery. Replace the pectoralis major, and notice that its lower margin does not come as low as that of the teres major; it is therefore quite easy to expose and ligature the third part of the axillary artery by an incision in the long axis of the arm, through the floor of the axilla, a little nearer the anterior than the post&rior fold. Sometimes the third part of the artery is crossed by some fleshy fibres running from the lower border of the pectoralis major to that of the latissimus dorsi. Comparative anatomy leaves us in no doubt that these are remnants of the panni- culus carnosus or skin musculature, and they are common enough to be worth a surgeon's notice. Tlie posterior relations of the third part of the axillary artery are the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles, as well as the two main branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, namely, the musculo- spiral and circumflex nerves. The musculo-spiral nerve [n. radialis] is the largest of all the branches of the brachial plexus; it is easily found by drawing the artery aside and looking behind. It passes down, with-the artery, in front of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles. The circumflex nerve [n. axillaris] is one which, we have observed, a student often has difficulty in finding readily in the examination-room. Draw the axillary artery outwards, and look for a nerve behind it rather smaller than the musculo- spiral, and on the outer side of the latter. It keeps close to the lower border of the subscapularis muscle, and dives back- wards round this border to disappear in the quadrilateral

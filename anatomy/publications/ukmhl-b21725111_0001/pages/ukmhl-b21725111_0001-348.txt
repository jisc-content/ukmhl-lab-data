The tendon of the popliteus muscle occupies the groove on the femur in flexion only. The popliteus is bound down by an aponeurosis, principally derived from the tendon of the semi- membranosus muscle. The popliteal vessels and internal popliteal nerve lie upon its posterior surface, and it is covered by the gastrocnemius muscle. 10', tibialis posticus. The three remaining muscles of this group are bound down together by a deep fascia, which extends between the tibia and fibula, and separates them from the soleus. TheyZexor longus digitorum pedis, ai flexor perforans, arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, in the space below the oblique line, and as far down as -within three inches of . ^ the inner ankle; it likewise aiises by aponeu- rotic fibres connected with the flexor longus pollicis, which pass over the surface of the The fleshy fibres pass obliquely backwards into a tendon

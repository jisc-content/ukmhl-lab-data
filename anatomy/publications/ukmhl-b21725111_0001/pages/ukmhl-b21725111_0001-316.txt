MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 2o4 internal oblique muscle ; it is separated from the muscle of the other side by a nan-ow interval, which is occupied by a dense fibrous structure, the Unea alba afterwards described. It arises from the upper margin of the pubes by a flat tendon consisting of two parts, of which the internal is much Fig. 200.

153 THE KNEE-JOINT. position: flexion is limited only by the contact of the neck of the femur with the acetaimhun. The round ligament is put upon the stretch when the thigh is partially flexed and adducted; it tiierefore resists dislocation upwards and backwards on the dorsum ilii, which is, notwithstanding its presence, the most frequent kind of displacement. The round ligament is also put upon the stretch in the position of flexion and external rotation. THE KNEE-JOINT. The articular surfaces of this complicated joint are the condyles of the femur and tibia, with fibro-cartilages interposed, the articulating surface of the patella, and the patellar surface of the femur. The action is mainly that of a hinge-joint. The joint is strengthened superficially by fibrous coverings A Fig. 140.

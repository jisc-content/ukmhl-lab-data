Pig- 160, Pig. 160.—YiEW OF THE Sub- maxillary Muscles and THE Depressors of the HroiD Bone and Larynx, FROM BEFORE. | On the right side, the platys- ma alone has been removed ; on the left side both the bellies of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid, the mylo-hyoid, the sterno-hyoid, and omo- hyoid muscles have been re- moved : a, symphysis; 6, angle of the lower jaw; c, middle of the body of the hyoid bone; d, mastoid pro- cess ; e, thyroid cartilage ; /, upper part of the sternum; g, lateral lobe, and +, isth- mus of the thyroid gland ; above +, the front of the cricoid cartilage covered by the crico-thyroid muscle; 1, posterior belly; 1', anterior belly of right digastric muscle ; 2, right mylo-hyoid; 3, left genio-hyoid ; 4, hyo-glossus; 5, stylo-glossus ; 6', a portion of it seen on right side ; 6, stylo-hyoid of the right side; 7, stylo-pharyngeus of the left side ; 8, placed on the levator scapuloB, points to the left middle constrictor of the pharynx; 9, placed on the middle scalenus, points to the left inferior constrictor; 10, right sternohyoid; 11, placed on the left sterno-thyroid, points also to the lower part of the right muscle ; 12, placed on the right sterno-mastoid, points to the upper and lower bellies of the right omo-hyoid (e, points to the thyro-hyoid muscle). The mylo-hyoid muscle arises from the mylo-hyoid ridge along the inner surface of the lower jaw, extending from the last molar tooth to the sym- physis. The posterior fibres are inserted into the body of the os hyoides ; the rest, proceeding parallel to the fibres behind, join at an angle with those of the corresponding muscle, forming with them a soit of raphe' along the middle line, from the symphysis of the jaw to the os hyoides. Thus the two muscles together form a floor below tlie anterior part of the moutli {diajylwacjma oris of Meyer).

The shafts and epiphyses unite from the 19th to the 21st year. COMPABISON OF THE UPPER WITH THE LOWER LIMB. The general resemblance which is manifest between the upper and lower limbs is found, on a closer inspection, to result from a community of plan, which can be traced even into certain comparatively minute details, and is not confined to any one system. The details of the correspondence in many points, however, are still un- determined, and even with regard to some parts of the skeleton, varieby of opinion still exists. In the hand and foot the correspondence of the bones is very plain. The palmar and plantar aspects being regarded as similar, the great toe corresponds obviously to the thumb; the four anterior tarsal bones bear a close resemblance to the four inferior carpal bones in the particulars of their metatarsal articulations; and of the remaining tarsal bones the scaphoid obviously corresponds to the bone of the same name in the hand, the astragalus to the semilunar bone, and the os calcis to the cuneiform and pisiform bones united. The great difference in the appearance of the tarsus from that of the carpus depends principally on the large development of the 08 calcis and astragalus, by means of which the scaphoid is thrown for- ward and inwards, and the aspect of the tarsus morphologically posterior, that on which the flexor tendons pass to the sole, is turned towards the inner side. If this be the correct comparison of the bones of the hand and foot, with regard to which there cannot be any doubt, it naturally follows that the tibia, lying as it does on the same side of the limb as the great toe, corresponds with the radius : a doctrine which, first laid down by De Blainville and then by Barclay, has been subsequently- enunciated by Flourens and Owen. Some anatomists, however, struck by the resem- blance of the patella to the olecranon, in position and in giving attachment to an ex- tensor muscle similar in appearance to the triceps extensor brachii, have taken a dif- ferent view; thus, according to Vicq D'Azyr, the tibia corresponds with the ulna, while, according to Bourgery, Cruveilhicr, and Martins, its upper end corresponds with the nlna and its lower end with the radius. This latter hypothesis must be regarded aa I 2

236 DORSAL MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. Fig. 191.â€”View of the Deep Muscles op tub Back, designed to show somewoat dia- okammaticallt thbiil Attachments to tub Veiitebkal Column and Bibs. | On the left side the seve- ral partsof theerectorspinaj are nearly in their natural position, with the excep- tion of the spinalis dorsi, which is drawn out laterally from tlie spines of the ver- tebrae ; on the right side the spinalis dorsi has been entirely removed, the ilio- costalis drawn to the outer side so as to expose its accessory muscle, and the longissimus removed except- ing small portions at its insertions. Superiorly on the left side, the trachelo- mastoid and complexus major are left nearly in their natural positions, while on the right side, the trachelo-mastoid has been entirely removed, and the complexus major, separated from its occipital attach- ment, has been spread out to the side so as to stretch its vertebral attachments. a, occipital protuberance ; b, mastoid process ; c, bifid spinous process of the axis vertebra; I, spinous pro- cess of the first dorsal ver- tebra and first rib; VI, sixth dorsal spine and trans- verse process and sixth rib; XII, twelfth dorsal spine and twelfth rib. On the left side of the figure, 1, com- plexus major muscle; 2, trachelo-mastoid; 3, serra- tus posticus superior, de- tached from the vertebral column and drawn upwards from the ribs ; 4, 4, the slips of attachment of the serratus posticus inferior to the four lower ribs ; 6, three slips of origin of the latis- simus dorsi from the lower ribs ; 5', iliac origin of the same muscle ; 6 +, common origin of the longissimus dorsi and ilio-costalis from the ilium and sac- rum, &c. ; 6, upper part of the longissimus dorsi ; 6',

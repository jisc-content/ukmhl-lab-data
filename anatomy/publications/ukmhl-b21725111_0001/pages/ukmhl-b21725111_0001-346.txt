MUSCLES or THE LOWER LIMB, the tendon of tlio semimembranosus muscle. A sesamoid fibro-cartilage is sometimes met with over the outer condyle of the femur, and occasionally- over the inner : it is rarely ossified. Tlic heads of the gastrocnemius muscle form the inferior boundaries of the popliteal space, and are placed between the hamstring muscles: the peroneal nerve is lodged between the external head and the biceps. The gastrocnemius conceals the popliteus muscle, with the popliteal vessels and internal popliteal nerve lying on its surface; the plantaris and soleus arc also covered by it. The short saphenous vein is placed on its surface, in the interval be- tween its two parts.

The soleus muscle arises ex- ternally from the posterior part of the head of the fibula, and from the surface beneath it for a, third of the length of the bone ; internally from the ob- lique line which gives insertion to the popliteus, and from the posterior edge of the tibia about three inches below that liuo ; also in the space intermediate between the tibia and fibula, from a ten- dinous band extended from one bone to the other over the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. Inferiorly the muscular fibres descend upon the tendo

magnus ; it Is inserted ten- diuously iuto the small tuber- osity of the humerus, and by fleshy fibres iuto the bone for a short distance lower down. Tendinous septa, attached to the ridges of the subscapular fossa, pass outwards in the origin of the muscle, and others aro prolonged inwards from the tendon of insertion. Fig. 175.—SuPERFioiAL Muscles OF THE SnOULDEB AND UpPER Limb, seen from behind. ^ a, acromion; 6, base of the sca- pula; c, tendon of the trapezius muscle over the triangular surface of the spine of the scapula; d, olecranon of the ulna ; e, external condyloid eminence; /, lower end of the ulna ; 1, trapezius ; 2, acro- mial part of deltoid ; 2', the part of the same muscle rising from the spine of the scapula ; 3, rhom- boideus major; 4, infraspinatus; 5, teres minor ; 6, teres major ; 7, latissimus dorsi; -|-, triangular space between the trapezius, rhom- boid and latissimus ; 9, triceps ex- tensor cubiti; 8', its outer head ; 8", part of its inner head ; 9, an- coneus ; 10, part of the brachialis anticus ; 11, supinator longus ; 12, extensor carpi radialis longior. The explanation of the remaining refer- ences will be found in the descrip- tion of fig. 182. The tendon of this muscle is in- corporated with the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and between its upper margin and the coracoid process is a bursa usually commu- nicating with that joint. Ante- riorly it is in contact at its origin with the serratus magnus, and is covered at its insertion by the coraco-brachialis and biceps, while, in the interval between, it forms part of the posterior wall of the axilla. The sv/praspinatus muscle arises from the whole surface of the supraspinous fossa of the scapula as far forward as the outer extremity of the spine, and from an aponeurosis, by which it is covered. It

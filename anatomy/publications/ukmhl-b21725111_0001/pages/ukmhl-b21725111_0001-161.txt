INCLINATION OF THE PELVIS H 2 about Fig. 91. Fig. 92, Fig. 91.—Vertical antero- posterior Section of a Female Pelvis, made THROUGH THE SYMPHYSIS Pubis and middle of THE Sacrum and Coccyx, showing the LEFT LATERAL HALF (reduced from Nii- gele's figuie). ^ 1, symphysis pubis ; 2, base of tbe sacrum and pro- montory ; 3, coccygeal bones ; 4, anterior superior spine of ilium ; 5, tuberosity of ischium ; 6, spine of ischium (the obturator foramen is not represented so pointed below as it generally is in females). The vertical and horizontal lines in the lower part of the figure serve as standards of cpmparison for the degree of inclination of the pelvis, as illustrated by the next figure. Fig. 92.—Sketch of part op the Preceding Figure, showing THE Inclination of the brim OF the Pelvis and its Axis IN the Erect Posture. \ a, 6, line of inclination of the brim of the true pelvis from above the symphysis pubis to the pro- montory of the sacrum : e, /, a line inclining backwards and up- wards, touching the lower edge of the symphysis pubis and point of the coccyx; c, d, axis of the brim at right angles to the plane of the brim ; from d to the dotted line at right angles to ef, curved axis of the cavity continued into that of the outlet of the osseous pelvis; h, g, axis of the outlet of the pelvis when tbe soft parts are combined. concave, while the anterior wall at the S3n3iphysi3 pubis is only one and a half or two inches long ; the axis is curved ; it is directed at the inlet upwards and forwards towards the um- bilicus, and at the outlet downwards and a little forwards. The curvature of the axis of the pelvis is specially important as indicating the course in which the child's head is propelled in the process of parturition ; and it may bo mentioned that in the female pelvis with the soft parts entire, the axis of the outlet ia curved much more forwards than in the skeleton, the

28 BONES OF THE THORAX. each side .are united together at then- anterior extremities in two longitudinal strips of cartilage, which afterwards jom together in the middle line to form the sternum. Fig. 24.—Ossification op the Steenum. A, the cartilaginous sternum befoie the middle of fcetal life. B, the sternum of a child at birth. 1, 2, 3, & 4, mark the commencing ossiGc nuclei for the manubrium and three upper pieces of the body. C, the sternum soon after puberty, showing cartilage between the maniibriuin and body, and imperfect union of the first, second, and third pieces of the body, while the third and fourth are united. D, shows an example of a sternum at birth with an unusual number of ossific centres, six in the manubrium, 1', which is very uncommon ; two pairs in the lower pieces of the body, 3' & 4', which is not unusual; 2, the single centre of the first piece of the body. E, exhibits an example of the perforated sternum which probably depends upon the imperfect union of the pairs of ossific nuclei shown in D in the lower part of the body ; this figure also shows two episternal bones or granules, * *. Ossification. ■—Each of the ribs is ossified from one principal centre, and possesses two small epiphyses,—one belonging to the head, and, except in the last two ribs, another belonging to the tubercle. The sternum is ossified in a number of separate pieces, one, at least, for each segment; the manubrium sometimes possesses two, placed one above FicT. 25.

Showing, at 1, the principal piece or body; 2, the epiphysis of the head ; 3, that of the tubercle. the other, and has been found with a greater number. The third, fourth, and fifth segments, as well as the ensiform portion, are frequently formed each from two nuclei placed side by side, which may remain distinct for

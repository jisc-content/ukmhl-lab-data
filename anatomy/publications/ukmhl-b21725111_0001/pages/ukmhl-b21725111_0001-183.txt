ARTICULATIONS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 121 appear that in certain positions they are not entirely so, and it can scarcely be doubted that when the surfaces are separated to any extent, doublings of the synovial membrane, or fatty processes connected with it and placed in the immediate vicinity of'the joint, contribute to fill up the vacuity. There are even instances in ■which it would appear that the separation of the surfaces must be considerable, as ia the case of the patella, more especially in complete extension of the knee, ARTICXJLATIONS OF THE TRUNK AND HEAD. ARTICULATIONS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The movable vertebr£e are connected together by elastic discs interposed between the bodies; by syjiovial joints between the articulating processes ; and by hgameuts.

The intervertebral discs are plates of composite structure placed one between the bodies of each pair of vertebrae from the axis to the base of the sacrum. Each is composed of a laminar part externally, and of a pulpy substance in the centre. The laminar part forms more than half of the mass, and consists of con- centric laminae of fibro-cartilage and fibrous, tissue alternating one with another. These laminae are not quite vertical, for if a vertical section of a disc be made, a certain number of the layers nearest to the circumference of the disc will be seen bulging outwards, while others situated more deeply and less closely compacted together are convex towards the centre ; and Fig. 108.

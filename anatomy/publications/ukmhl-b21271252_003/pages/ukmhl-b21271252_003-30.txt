Tendon of the popliteus muscle. 4. External lateral ligament. RIGHT KNEE-JOINT FROM BEHIND. The tendons and the posterior ligament have been removed to show the semilunar cartilages and the posterior crucial ligament. The posterior crucial ligament is attached below to the back part of the head of the tibia, between the articular surfaces, and to the posterior aspect of the head, receiving also a slip from the external semilunar cartilage, and it passes upwards, forwards and inwards to be attached to the outer surface of the internal condyle in its anterior oblique part. The upper part of the anterior crucial ligament is seen ascending on the outer side of the former to be attached to the inner aspect of the external condyle near the back. On the outer side of the femur, the tendon of the popliteus muscle springs from the front of a groove on the outer aspect of the external condyle, under cover of the external lateral ligament, which is attached to a tubercle on the external condyle at a higher level, and passes down to the head of the fibula. On the inner side the tendon of the semimembranosus has been turned aside to show a bursa which intervenes between it and the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The fig 2.

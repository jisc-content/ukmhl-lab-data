LOWER LIMB DEEP DISSECTION OF THIGH. The pectineus and psoas muscles have been reflected, in addition to the dissection in No. 3, and an additional inch of the femoral vessels has been removed. The capsule of the hip-joint is closely invested by numerous powerful muscles. On the outer side are the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius, in front the rectus femoris, iliacus, and psoas, in that order from without inwards. Further to the inner side is the pectineus, and behind it the adductor magnus, with the obturator externus winding round below the capsule. These relations are of great importance in connection with the spread of abscesses from the hip-joint. The internal circumflex artery, having passed between the psoas and pectineus, continues its course backwards between the adductor magnus and obturator externus, giving branches to these The obturator nerve is seen running on the surface of the adductor magnus, but only a small portion of the adductor brevis is seen, at the upper border of the adductor longus. A further relationship of the superficial femoral and profunda femoris vessels should be noticed. The nerve to the tensor fasciae femoris is seen just above and outside 2. The fii s indicate—

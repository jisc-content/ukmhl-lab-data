THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. DEEP DISSECTION OF THIGH.—No. 2. In addition to the former dissection, the pectineus muscle has been divided and removed, and the superficial femoral vessels divided close to their upper end and removed, to show the profunda femoris vessels. The vein has been divided about 1J inches lower than the artery. The profunda femoris arises from the outer back part of the femoral artery, and after a short course outwards, passes inwards behind the femoral vessels, resting successively upon the iliacus, pectineus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus muscles. In this view, muscular branches are seen going to the adductor muscles, and it also gives off circumflex and perforating branches. Behind the pectineus, the anterior division of the obturator nerve is seen emerging from the thyroid foramen over the obturator externus muscle. On the outer side of the thigh is seen the fascial investment which clothes the tensor fasciae femoris muscle. The layer upon the deep surface of that muscle passes deeply inwards to join the capsule of the hip-joint. 1. Sartorius muscle divided. 2. Iliacus muscle. 3. Pectineus muscle divided. 4. Adductor longus muscle. 5. Adductor brevis muscle. 6. Adductor gracilis muscle. 7. Adductor magnus muscle. 8. Obturator externus muscle. The figures indicate— 9. Eectus femoris muscle. 10. Tensor fasciae femoris. 11. Fascia on deep aspect of tensor fasciae femoris. 12. Points to crural canal. 13. Poupart’s ligament. 14. Femoral artery divided. 15. Profunda femoris vessels. 16. Muscular branches of anterior crural nerve.

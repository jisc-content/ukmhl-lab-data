C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PORTIONS OF THE PYRIFORMIS, OBTURATOR INTERNUS AND GEMELLI, AND QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLES, HAVE BEEN REMOVED, AND THE TENDON OF THE BICEPS AND SEMITENDINOSUS DIVIDED AND TURNED ASIDE. Below the level of the pyriformis muscle, the sciatic and internal pudic arteries emerge close to one another through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The internal pudic artery, with two venae comites, passes almost at once into the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, lying above the obturator internus muscle, and it is accompanied by the internal pudic nerve and the nerve to the obturator internus. The latter nerve lies close to the muscle to which it is distributed, i.e. on the outer side of the artery, and it gives a branch to the superior gemellus muscle. The internal pudic vessels and nerve then pass into the lateral wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, and there give off their inferior hsemorrhoidal branches. The nerve to the quadratus femoris is a small muscular branch from the sacral plexus which passes down, covered by the great sciatic nerve and by the obturator internus and gemelli muscles. It supplies also the inferior gemellus muscle and the hip-joint. With these dissections, the view of the Hip-joint should be referred to. (Hip-joint, No. 1.) 2. Great trochanter of femur. 6.

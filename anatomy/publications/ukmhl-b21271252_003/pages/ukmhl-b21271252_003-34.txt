THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. POPLITEAL SPACE—No. 3. PORTIONS OF THE SEMIMEMBRANOSUS AND SEMITENDINOSUS MUSCLES HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO SHOW THE DEEPER LYING STRUCTURES. The popliteal vessels are seen to lie under cover of the semimembranosus in the upper part of the space, with the internal popliteal nerve on their outer side. At this level, they lie upon the popliteal surface of the femur, and to the inner side of this is seen the tendon of the adductor magnus muscle, with the superior internal articular artery passing inwards under it to the vastus internus muscle. There is a large bursa between the tendon of the semimembranosus and the back of the internal condyle, usually communicating with the knee-joint. As the vessels and nerve pass downwards, they assume different relations, and come to lie in line from before backwards, the nerve being most superficial, and the artery remaining deepest in the space. This is their position as they pass between the heads of the gastrocnemius. 1. Semitendinosus (divided). 2. Semimembranosus (divided). 3. Sartorius. 4. Adductor gracilis. 5. Gastrocnemius. 6. Biceps. 7. Popliteal vein. The figures indicate— 8. Popliteal artery. 9. Internal popliteal nerve. 10. External popliteal nerve. 11. Short saphenous nerve. 12. Long saphenous vein divided, with corresponding nerve beside it. 13. Adductor magnus.

In addition to the dissection described in Scarpa’s triangle, No. 2, the iliacus and sartorius muscles have- been divided, and portions removed. The tensor fasciae femoris muscle arises from the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, the notch below the anterior superior spine, and from the fascia covering the. muscle, and is inserted into the fascia lata. The rectus femoris arises by two heads, a straight head, attached to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, and a reflected head, not seen, attached to the dorsum of the ilium above the acetabulum. These muscles constitute important guides in cutting down upon the hip joint from the front. Behind the iliacus is seen the front of the capsule of the hip-joint, and upon it is a smooth surface forming the back wall of a bursa, which occasionally communicates with the joint cavity. The fibrous tissue forms a prominent vertical band between the iliacus and psoas. The relations of the superficial femoral vessels and the profunda femoris should be noticed—the profunda artery lies on the outer side of the femoral vein in this part of its course, while the profunda vein joins the femoral vein lower down, where that vein is lying behind its corresponding artery. The nerve to the pectineus muscle is seen in close relation to the internal circumflex artery. 4. Rectus femoris muscle, straight head. 10. Femoral vein, lying behind femoral artery.

Bony points.—When the knee-joint is fully extended, the patella rises up in front of the lower end of the femur, and its lower border comes to be in line with the joint. Above the patella is a depressed area, corresponding to the fibrous tendon of the quadriceps extensor muscle, rather of the shape of an inverted Y. The point of the Y passes between the fleshy prominences of the vastus externus and internus muscles, the vastus internus passing lower The anterior tubercle of the tibia forms a distinct prominence in the middle of the front of the leg, below the ligamentum patelke, and the external and internal tuberosities lie on each side of it but at a higher level. The head of the fibula lies at the same level as the anterior tubercle, but is not seen, as it lies on the outer side towards the back. The prominence of the biceps is seen on the outer side. On the outer side of the knee is a flattened region, corresponding to the ilio-tibial band, passing down to the external tuberosity of the tibia. On the inner side is a prominence, formed by the sartorius, adductor gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles, which passes downwards, outwards, and forwards. The muscles cannot be distinguished from one another. Compare with this view, Knee Joint No. 1. 2. Yastus internus. 5. Internal tubercle of tibia. 7. Inner head of gastrocnemius. 3. Centre of patella.

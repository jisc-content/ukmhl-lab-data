THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. 0. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. HUNTER’S CANAL.—No. 1. SKIN AND FASCIAL HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE FRONT AND INNER PART OF THE THIGH, TO SHOW THE MUSCLES AND NERVES. The sartorius muscle passes obliquely downwards and inwards across the lower part of the thigh to its insertion into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia. It crosses the rectus femoris, vastus internus, adductor longus and magnus, and comes to lie in contact with the adductor gracilis, and conceals from view the femoral vessels lying in Hunter’s canal. This muscle is the most important and useful landmark of the front of the thigh, especially with reference to the femoral vessels. Cutaneous nerves are seen in relation to its surface, the patellar branch of the long saphenous piercing it, and a branch from the internal cutaneous nerve joined by a branch from the anterior division of the obturator nerve running down on its surface. In the interval between the vastus internus and sartorius is found the rounded tendon of the adductor magnus, and, in front of it, the long saphenous nerve and a branch of the anastomotica magna artery. This region is of importance surgically as being the place usually selected for osteotomy of the femur. The figures 1. Rectus femoris muscle. 2. Vastus internus muscle. 3. Sartorius muscle. 4. Adductor longus muscle. 5. Adductor gracilis muscle. 6. Adductor magnus muscle and tendon. indicate— 7. Cutaneous branch of obturator nerve. 8. Patellar branch of long saphenous. 9. Long saphenous nerve, and branch of anas- tomotica magna artery. 10. Internal cutaneous nerve.

RIGHT KNEE-JOINT, VIEWED FROM IN FRONT. The fibrous expansion from the quadriceps extensor which fills up the interval on each side of the ligamentum patella* has been removed to show the synovial membrane and the edges of the semilunar cartilages. The ligamentum patellae is about two inches in length, and passes from the apex and lower border of the patella to the lower part of the anterior tubercle of the tibia. Some of its fibres are continuous with the tendon of the quadriceps. The ligament is separated from the joint by the infra- patellar pad of fat (which has been removed), and a bursa intervenes between it and the upper part of the tuberosity of the tibia. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint is seen on each side passing upwards in the form of a pouch, in front of the lower end of the femur, and the extent to which it covers the front of the bone should be noticed. The semilunar cartilages are attached to the head of the tibia along their margins by the coronary ligament. This has been removed from the outer cartilage, and the margins of the two cartilages are seen in the position in which they can be felt in the living subject. In relation to the joint on each side are seen the tendon of the sartorius muscle on the inner aspect, and that of the biceps on the outer. 1. Tendon of insertion of the quadriceps 2. Patella. 4.

PORTIONS OF THE TIBIALIS ANTICUS AND EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM MUSCLES HAVE BEEN REMOVED, IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE DEEPER STRUCTURES. The extensor longus hallucis muscle takes origin from the middle two-fourths of the anterior surface of the shaft of the fibula, behind the extensor longus digitorum and from the interosseous membrane, and it is inserted into the base of the terminal, and frequently also into the proximal, phalanx-of the great toe. The anterior tibial artery comes into this region by passing through an opening in the inter- osseus membrane, between the bones of the leg, and passes down on the interosseus membrane and on the tibia to the front of the ankle-joint. It is therefore deeply placed in the upper part of the leg, between the tibialis anticus on the inner side, and the extensor longus digitorum and extensor longus hallucis on the outer, but, lower down, the latter muscle crosses it, and its tendon lies to the inner side of the artery at the ankle. The artery gives off an anterior tibial recurrent branch, as well as muscular branches, and, near the ankle, gives off two malleolar branches. The anterior tibial nerve, a branch of the external popliteal, begins at the neck of the fibula, and joins the corresponding artery by piercing the extensor longus digitorum muscle. It runs down in company with the artery, giving branches to all the muscles in this compartment of the leg, and an articular branch to the ankle-joint. The relations of the nerve and artery in the lower part are seen in the view of the Dorsum of the Foot. No. 3. o Peroneus brevis. 8. Interosseous membrane.

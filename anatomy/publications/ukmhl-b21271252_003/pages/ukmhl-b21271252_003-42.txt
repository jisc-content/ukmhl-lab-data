THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB, BACK OF LEG.—No. 1. THE SKIN, LAYERS OF FASCIA AND SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN REMOVED, TO SHOW THE MUSCLES. The gastrocnemius muscle arises by two heads from the lower end of the femur (see Popliteal Space, No. 2.). The inner head is the larger of the two and extends further down, and the two heads are inserted into a flattened, thin tendon, into which the fibres of the soleus muscle also are inserted. This tendon narrows as it passes down, becomes thicker and forms the tendo Achillis, which is inserted into an impression on the back of the os calcis, below a smooth area, which is in contact with a bursa separating the tendon from the upper part of the bone. The tendon of the plantaris makes its appearance below the middle of the leg on the inner side of the tendo Achillis, emerging from between the gastrocnemius and soleus, and it passes down by the side of that tendon, to be inserted separately into the posterior part of the os calcis. The outer margin of the tendo Achillis receives fibres of the soleus muscle till within a short distance of the heel. The figures indicate— 1. Inner head of gastrocnemius. 2. Outer head of gastrocnemius. 3. Soleus. 4. Tendon of gastrocnemius. 5. Plantaris. 6. Peroneus longus.

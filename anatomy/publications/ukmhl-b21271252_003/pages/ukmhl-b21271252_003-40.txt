THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. DORSUM OF FOOT—No. 3. THE TENDONS ON THE FRONT OF THE ANKLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND A PORTION OF THE EXTENSOR BREVIS DIGITORUM HAS BEEN REMOVED, TO SHOW THE DEEPER STRUCTURES. The anterior tibial nerve ends by dividing into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch passes forwards on the outer side of the dorsalis pedis artery, gives a branch which passes outwards and supplies the tarso-metatarsal and the metatarso-phalangeal joints, and then becomes cutaneous in the first intermetatarsal space. The external branch passes outwards under the extensor brevis digitorum and supplies that muscle and the adjacent joints. Twigs which pass from the nerve to the first and second dorsal interosseous muscles are said to be sensory in character, and not motor to these muscles. The malleolar branches of the anterior tibial artery are seen, the external passing outwards to anastomose with the anterior division of the peroneal artery, and the inner passing to anastomose with internal calcanean branches on the inner side of the heel. The relation of the anterior tibial nerve and artery in the lower part of the leg is seen. The nerve lies in front of the artery above, but passes again to its outer side in front of the ankle-joint, and gives off a fine articular branch to the ankle just before dividing into its terminal branches. The figures indicate:— Muscles, etc. 1. Extensor brevis digitorum. Nerves. 7. Anterior tibial. 2. Peroneus tertius. 8. Anterior tibia], outer division. 3. Extensor longus digitorum. 9. Anterior tibial, inner division. 4. Peroneus brevis. Vessels. 10. Anterior tibial vessels. 5. Tibialis anticus. 11. Anterior peroneal vessels. Nerves. 6. External saphenous. 12. Tarsal vessels.

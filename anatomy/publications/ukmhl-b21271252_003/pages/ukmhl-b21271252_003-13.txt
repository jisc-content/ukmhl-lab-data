THE SARTORIUS MUSCLE HAS BEEN DIVIDED NEAR ITS ORIGIN AND REMOVED TO SHOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES WITHIN THE SPACE. The femoral artery begins at Poupart’s ligament as the direct continuation of the external iliac artery. For a distance of about two inches it is known as the common femoral, but it then divides into two branches, one, the direct continuation, is known as the superficial femoral, while the other branch, passing deeply, is called the profunda femoris. ■ The common femoral is superficially placed, being covered only by the roof of the triangle, and by some of the contents, and it rests upon the muscles forming the floor, i.e. upon the psoas and pectineus, while lower down, the superficial femoral lies upon the adductor longus. The femoral vein lies at first along the inner side, but comes to lie behind the superficial femoral artery, and the anterior crural nerve lies to the outer side. The branches of this nerve pass in different relations to the artery, the nerve to the pectineus passes behind it, the internal cutaneous nerve crosses in front of it, and the long saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus internus lie along its outer side. Branches.—The superficial inguinal branches have been previously seen, and the deep external pudic runs across the pectineus ana adductor longus muscles to the external genitals. The course of the profunda femoris and its branches is seen in another view, and also the branches given off by the superficial femoral in Hunter’s canal.

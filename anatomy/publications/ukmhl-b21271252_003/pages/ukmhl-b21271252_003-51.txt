Ankle.—The posteriqr, almost horizontal, fasciculus of the external lateral ligament is seen passing to the back of the os calcis. It lies below the posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, which unites the two bones of the leg, and which conceals almost entirely the transverse ligament, which lies on a deeper plane. 2. Foot.—The posterior astragalo-calcanean ligament unites these two bones, passing from a tubercle on the back of the astragalus to the upper and inner part of the posteriqr portion of the os calcis. The joints on this aspect are greatly strengthened by the strong tendons of muscles which pass in close relation to them, frequently grooving the bones. Thus the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum tendons lie in a groove on the back of the lower end of the tibia, while the flexor longus hallucis occupies a deep groove on the back of the astragalus, and the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis lie in a groove on the back of the external malleolus. 3.

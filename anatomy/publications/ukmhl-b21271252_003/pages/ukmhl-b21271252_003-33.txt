THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. POPLITEAL SPACE.—No. 2. THE ROOF OF THE SPACE HAS BEEN REMOVED, WITH THE FAT AND LYMPHATIC GLANDS LYING IN THE SPACE. The usual description of the popliteal space as a diamond-shaped area is hardly accurate. As there is practically no natural interval between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, the space is more triangular in shape. The upper and outer boundary is formed by the biceps muscle, and the upper and inner by the semimembranosus, a fleshy mass, on which lies the tendon of the semitendinosus, while further to the inner side are seen the adductor gracilis and the sartorius muscles. The fleshy mass of the gastrocnemius fills up the lower part of the space. Lying most superficially is the external popliteal nerve, close to the inner margin of the biceps, while the short saphenous nerve is formed high up in the space in this specimen, by the junction of two branches, or rami communicantes, from the external and internal popliteal nerves. A vein of some size accompanies the nerve. The other contents of the space are hidden from view by the belly of the semimembranosus. 1. Biceps flexor cruris muscle. 2. Semitendinosus muscle. 3. Semimembranosus muscle. 4. Adductor gracilis muscle. 5. Sartorius muscle. The figures indicate— 6. and 7. Inner and outer heads of gastrocnemius muscle. 8. Bifurcation of great sciatic nerve. 9. External or short saphenous nerve. 10. External popliteal nerve.

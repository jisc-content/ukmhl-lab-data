THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. 0. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. BACK OF LEG—No. 2. THE GASTROCNEMIUS, PLANTARIS, AND SOLEUS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED TO SHOW THE DEEPER LYING GROUP OF MUSCLES. The soleus arises from both of the bones of the leg, and from a fibrous arch between them. It is attached to the head and to the upper third of the posterior surface of the shaft of the fibula, and to the oblique line of the tibia and to the inner border of the shaft in its upper half, and it is inserted into the tendo Achillis. The posterior tibial vessels and nerve pass down between these two heads of origin, and are covered by the fibrous arch from which also the muscle takes origin. Under cover of the soleus lie the flexor longus digitorum on the inner side, the flexor longus hallucis on the outer side, and the tibialis posticus between them, covered by the flexor longus hallucis, with the posterior tibial nerve and vessels with their branches. The flexor longus digitorum arises from the inner part of the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line, down to within a short distance of the lower end of the bone. The flexor longus hallucis, on the other hand, arises from the lower two-thirds of the outer portion of the posterior surface of the fibula. Both muscles also take origin from the fibrous mem- branes beside them, i.e. the fascia covering the tibialis posticus, and the posterior peroneal septum. The tibialis posticus is concealed from view by the flexor longus hallucis. (See No. 3.) The figures indicate— Muscles, etc. 1. Tendo Achillis. 2. Soleus. 3. Peroneus longus. 4.

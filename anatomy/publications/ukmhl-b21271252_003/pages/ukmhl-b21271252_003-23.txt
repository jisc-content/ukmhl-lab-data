THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LOWER LIMB. BACK OF THIGH.â€”No. 1. THE SKIN, LAYERS OF FASCIA, AND SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO SHOW THE MUSCLES. The hamstring group of muscles forms a large muscular mass on the back of the thigh. The biceps and semitendinosus, arising by a common tendon from the posterior, inferior, and internal facet on the back part of the ischial tuberosity, lie at first side by side. The semimembranosus arising from the anterior, superior, and external portion of this area of the ischial tuberosity is concealed in the upper part, but, lower down, appears between the other muscles, and lies more in the centre of the limb. The biceps covers the great sciatic nerve, crossing it very obliquely from above downwards and outwards, and under cover of that muscle the nerve usually divides into the two terminal branches which, in this specimen, lie very superficially in the popliteal space. A septum of connective tissue separates the biceps from the adjacent vastus externus muscle, but there is only a very thin septum between the semimembranosus and the adductor muscles on the inner side of the thigh. The hamstrings are all supplied by the great sciatic nerve. The figures indicate 1. Biceps muscle. 2. Semitendinosus muscle. 3. Semimembranosus muscle. 4. Gluteus maximus insertion. 5. Yastus externus muscle. 6. Adductor magnus muscle. 7. Adductor gracilis and sartorius muscles. 8. Quaclratus femoris muscle. 9. Great sciatic nerve in two bands. 10. External and internal popliteal nerves.

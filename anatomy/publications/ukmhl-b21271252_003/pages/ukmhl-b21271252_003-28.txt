THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O. LOWER LIMB. ARTICULATIONS, KNEE-JOINT—No. 2. TWO SPECIMENS OF THE RIGHT KNEE-JOINT, VIEWED FROM THE INNER SIDE. The ligamentum patellae has been isolated in A, and in B the tendons have been turned aside to show the internal lateral ligament. On the inner side of the joint are found the tendons of the sartorius, adductor gracilis and semitendinosus muscles, passing down to be inserted into the upper part of the shaft of the tibia, while the tendon of the semimembranosus lies more posteriorly, and is inserted mainly into the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The internal lateral ligament is continuous above with the tendon of the adductor magnus, and probably represents a degenerated portion of that muscle. It is attached above to the internal condyle below the adductor tubercle, and passes as a wide, flat band down to the inner part of the shaft of the tibia, to which it is attached, below the internal tuberosity. A bursa intervenes between it and the tendons which lie upon its superficial surface. The pouch of synovial membrane which passes up on the inner side in front of the lower end of the femur is well seen in A. 1. Vastus internus muscle. 2. Sartorius muscle. 3. Adductor gracilis muscle. 4. Semitendinosus muscle. 5. Semimembranosus muscle. The figures indicate— 6. Pouch of synovial membrane. 7. Internal lateral ligament. 8. Internal semilunar cartilage. 9. Tendon of adductor magnus. 10. Bursa.

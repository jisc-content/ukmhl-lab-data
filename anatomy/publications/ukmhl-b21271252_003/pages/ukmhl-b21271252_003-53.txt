THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. INNER SIDE OF THIGH. LOWER LIMB, SURFACE ANATOMY.—No. 2. The figures indicate— LOWER LIMB SURFACE ANATOMY. No. 3. Scarpa’s triangle. 5. Vkstus internus muscle. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. The landmarks on this aspect are entirely muscular, as far down as to the region of the knee- joint. Here the adductor tubercle can be felt, between the sartorius and the vastus internus. This tubercle gives the position of the lower epiphysial cartilage on the inner side. The sartorius muscle forms an important landmark in nearly its whole length. In the upper part of the thigh it lies to the outer side of the femoral vessels, at tbe middle third of the thigh it crosses them and comes to their inner side. In this region it forms the roof for Hunter’s canal. The fleshy mass of the adductor muscles is very wide at the upper part, but narrows rapidly as it passes down the thigh. The individual muscles cannot be identified on the surface, but the tendon origin of the adductor longus can be felt at the upper part, and the insertion of the adductor magnus into the adductor tubercle. With this view, Hunter’s Canal, If os. 1 and 2, should be examined. 1. Sartorius muscle, bounding Scarpa’s triangle. 4. Hunter’s canal, covered by the sartorius 2. Adductor muscles. muscle. <N 2

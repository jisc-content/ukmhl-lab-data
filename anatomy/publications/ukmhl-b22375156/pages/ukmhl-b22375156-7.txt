PREFACE. Vll a future year, should this proposal be approved of, to give a course in the succeeding term on Comparative Anatomy. The arrangement in this Syllabus has been made solely with the view of convenience in demonstration: I shall endeavour to adhere to it as closely as I can; some occasional devia- tions will be unavoidable from the nature of the subject. St. John's College, Jan. 28, 1817.

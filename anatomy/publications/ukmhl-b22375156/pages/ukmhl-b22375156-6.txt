Human Anatomy, therefore, independently of its being more immediately connected with professional pursuits, a consideration undoubtedly of im- portance in a University like ours, has this also to recommend it, that it ought to be under- stood by those who are desirous of studying Comparative Anatomy to any useful purpose. With this view, and in order to afford an op- portunity to those who may wish to make them- selves acquainted with the subject, I intend in

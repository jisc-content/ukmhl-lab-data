40 PHYSIOLOGY of the BRAIN and NERVES. 204. The brain and nerves the medium of sensa- tion. The faculties of the mind supposed to reside in the brain. 205. Pressure on the brain produces coma, or insensibility.—Other injuries of the brain, as inflammation, &c. cause correspondent affections of the mental faculties. 206. Insanity and idiotcy often produced by dis- ease and malformation of the contents of the skull. 207. Considerable disease, and even partial de- struction of the cerebral mass sometimes unaccompanied by any derangement of the mind. 208. Physiology of the brain obscure: various theories on the subject. Hypotheses of Des Cartes, Gall, &c. 209. The brain the organ of perception: impres- sions made on the extremities of the nervous propagated to the brain:—arguments in favor of this opinion.

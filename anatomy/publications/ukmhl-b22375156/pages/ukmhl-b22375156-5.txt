PREFACE. In proposing the following Syllabus, I am far from intending to embrace all the subjects of interest connected with the study of Anatomy: I have made a selection of those only which are the most important, and which will admit of being explained in the time to which the Lectures are limited. In this selection I have given the preference to Human Anatomy over what is called Com- parative Anatomy, by which is understood the Anatomy of the Brute creation. As in doing this I have deviated from the plan which was latterly followed by my prede- cessor, I may be expected to state my reasons for making this choice.

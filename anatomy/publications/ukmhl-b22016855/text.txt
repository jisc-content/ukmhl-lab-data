SERJBANT-SDRGEON TO THE QUEEN, MEMBER OP THE INSTITUTE OP FRANCE, IN ADMIRATION OF THE HKJH ATTAINMENTS WHICH HAVE JUSTLY PLACED HIM IN THE FIRST RANK OF HIS PROFESSION, THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBEDPREFACE. In preparing the “ Anatomist’s Vade Mecum,” for the fourth time, for the Press, the Author has availed him- self of the discoveries, in Anatomy, -which have been made public since the appearance of the preceding edition; and he takes the opportunity, now alforded him, of acknowledging his obligation to the several investigators whose researches he has quoted. To one gentleman, namely, to Mr. Paget of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, he feels particularly indebted for the assistance which he has derived from the excellent “Reports, on the chief results obtained by the use of the Microscope in the study of Human Anatomy and Physiology,” published in the British and Foreign Medical Review. In the present edition of this volume, the Wood-cut Illustrations have been augmented to two hundred; and the Author begs to observe that, with very few exceptions, which have been duly acknowledged, the whole of the subjects are original; the drawings having been executed by Mr. Bagg from dissections prepared expressly for the work, or from drawings made by himself. The chief of the illustrations of General Anatomy were drawn from the microscope with the camera lucida, in order to ensure absolute correctness.

The bones are the organs of support to the animal frame; they give firmness and strength to the entire fabric, afford points of con- nection to the numerous muscles, and bestow individual character upon the body. In the limbs they are hollow cylinders, admirably calculated by their conformation and structure to resist violence and support weight. In the trunk and head, they are flattened and arched, to protect cavities and provide an extensive surface for attachment. In some situations they present projections of variable length, which serve as levers; and in others are grooved into smooth surfaces, which act as pulleys for the passage of tendons. Moreover, besides suppl}'- ing strength and solidity, they are equally adapted, by their numerous divisions and mutual apposition, to fulfil every movement which may tend to the preservation of the creature, or be conducive to his welfare. According to the latest analysis by Berzelius, bone is composed of about one-third of animal substance, which is almost completely redu- cible to gelatine by boiling, and of two-thirds of earthy and alkaline salts. The special constituents of bone are present in the following proportions;— Cartilage 32‘17 parts. Blood-vessels . . . . 1-13 Phosphate of lime . . . . 51 ’04 Carbonate of lime . . . 11 '30 Fluate of lime .... 2*00 Phosphiite of magnesia . , 1 • 16 Soda, chloride of sodium . . P20 100-00 B2 STRUCTURE OF BONE. Bones are divisible into three classes :—Long, fat, and irregular. The Long bones are found principally in the limbs, and consist of a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is cylindrical or prismoid in form, dense and hard in texture, and hollowed in the interior into a medullary canal. The extremities are broad and expanded, to articu- late with adjoining bones; and cellular or cancellous in internal struc- ture. Upon the exterior of the bone are processes and rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and foramina for the transmission of vessels and nerves. The character of long bones is, therefore, their general type of structure and their divisibility into a central portion and extremities, and not so much their length; for there are some long bones, as the second phalanges of the toes, which are less than a quarter of an inch in length, and almost equal, and in some instances exceed, in breadth their longitudinal axis. The long bones are, the clavicle, humerus, radius and ulna, femur, tibia and fibula, metacarpal bones, metatarsal, phalanges, and ribs. Flat bones are composed of two layers of dense bone with an inter- mediate cellular structure, and are divisible into surfaces, borders, angles, and processes. They are adapted to inclose cavities; have processes upon their surface for the attachment of muscles; and are perforated by foramina, for the passage of nutrient vessels to their cells, and for the transmission of vessels and nerves. They articulate with long bones by means of smooth surfaces plated with cartilage, and with each other either by fibrous tissue, as at the sjunphysis pubis; or by suture, as in the bones of the skull. The two condensed layers of the bones of the skull are named tables; and the intermediate cellular structure, diplde. The flat bones are the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrj’^mal, vomer, sternum, scapulae, and ossa inno- minata. The Irregular bones include all that remain after the long and the flat bones have been selected. The}' are essentially irregular in their form, in some parts flat, in others short and thick. In preceding edi- tions of this work the short and thick bones were made a separate class, under the name of short hones. This subdivision has been found to be disadvantageous, besides being arbitrary, and is, therefore, now omitted. Irregular bones are constructed on the same general princi- ples with other bones; they have an exterior dense, and an interior more or less cellular. The bones of this class are, the temporal, sphe- noid, ethmoid,, superior maxillary, inferior maxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, hyoid, vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, carpal and tarsal bones, and sesamoid bones, including the patellae. Structure of Bone.—Bone is a dense, compact, and homogeneous sub- stance (basis substance) filled with minute cells (corpuscles of Purk- inje), which are scattered numerously through its structure. The basis substance of bone is subfibrous and obscurely lamellated, the lamellae being concentric in long and parallel in flat bones; it is traversed in all directions, but especially in the longitudinal axis, by branching and inosculating canals (Haversian canals), which give passage to vesselsand nerves, and in certain situations the lamellae separate from each other, and leave between them areolar spaces (cancelli) of various magnitude. The lamellae have an average diameter of of an inch, and, besides constituting the general structure of the basis sub- stance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about of an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameters of the canals have a medium average of of an inch. The cancelli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are composed of lamellae; and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be com- pared to an Haversian canal of which the medullary cavity is the mag- nified channel; and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the • Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg. Magnified 300 diameters. 1.

The cells of bone, or corpuscles of Purkinje, are thickly disseminated through the basis substance ; they are irregular in size and form, give oif numerous minute branching tubuli which radiate from all parts of their circumference, and in the dried state of the bone contain merely the remains of membranous cells and some calcareous salts.* In the living bone the cells and their tubuli are probably filled with a nutri- tive fluid holding calcareous salts in solution. The form of the cells is oval or round, and more or less flattened,; their long diameter corre- sponds with the long axis of the bone, and their tubuli cross the direc- tion of the lamellae, and constitute a very delicate network in the basis substance, by communicating with each other and with the tubuli of neighbouring cells. The tubuli of the cells nearest the Haversian canals terminate upon the internal surface of those cavities. The size of the cells varies in extreme measurement from to of an inch in their long diameter, an ordinary average being ; the breadth of the oval cells is about one-half or one-third their length, and their thickness one-half their breadth. They are situated between the lamellae, to which circumstance they owe their compressed form. In the fresh state, bones are invested by a dense fibrous membrane, the 'periosteum^ which covers every part of their surface with the ex- ception of the articular extremities, the latter being coated by a thin layer of cartilage. The periosteum of the bones of the skull is termed pericranium; and the analogous membrane of external cartilages, peri- chondrium, Lining the interior of the medullary canal of long bones, the Haversian canals, the cells of the cancelli, and the cells of short, flat, and irregular bones, is the medullary membrane, which acts as an in- ternal periosteum. It is through the medium of the vessels ramifying in these membranes that the changes required by nutrition occur in bones, and the secretion of medulla into their interior is effected. The medullary canal, Haversian canals, and cells of long bones, and the cells of other bones, are filled with a yellowish oily substance, the medulla,, which is contained in a loose areolar tissue formed by the medullary membrane. Development of Bone.—To explain the development of bone it is ne- cessary to inform the student that all organised bodies, whether belong- ing to the vegetable or the animal kingdom, are developed primordially from minute vesicles. These vesicles, or, as they are commonly termed, cells, are composed of a thin membrane containing a fluid or granular matter, and a small rounded mass, the nucleus, around which the cell was originally formed. Moreover, the nucleus generally con- tains one or more small round granules, the nmleolus or mwleoli. From cells having this structure all the tissues of the body are elaborated ; • Muller and Hcnlo conceived that the bone cells and tubuli were the prin- cipal seat of the calcareous matter. Hence they have been named cakigerous cells and tubuli.5 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. the ovum itself originally presented this simple form, and the embryo at an early period is wholl}' composed of such nucleated cells. In their relation to each other, cells may be isolated and independent, as is exemplified in the corpuscles of the blood, chyle, and lymph ; secondly, they may cohere by their surfaces and borders, as in the epiderma and epithelium; thirdly, they may be connected by an intermediate substance, which is then termed intercellular, as in cartilage and bone; and, fourthly, they may unite with each other in rows, and upon the removal, by liquefaction, of the adherent surfaces, be converted into hollow tubuli. In the latter mode capillary vessels are formed, as also are the tubuli of nerve and muscular fibre. One of the properties of cells may also be adverted to in this place; it is that of reproducing similar cells in their interior. In this case the nucleoli become the nuclei of the secondary cells, and as the latter increase in size, the membrane of the primary or parent cell is lost. Bone, in its earliest stage, is composed of an assemblage of these minute cells, which are soft and transparent, and are disposed within the embryo in the site of the future skeleton. From the resemblance which the soft tissue bears to jelly, this has been termed gelatinous stage of osteo-genesis. As development advances, the cells, heretofore loosely collected together, become separated by the interposition of a transparent intercellular substance, which is at first fluid, but gradually becomes hard and condensed. The cartilaginous stage of osteo-genesis is now established, and cartilage is shewn to consist of a transparent matrix, having minute cells disseminated at pretty equal distances and without order through its structure. Coincident with the formation of cartilage is the development of vascular canals in its substance, the canals being formed by the union of the cells in rows, and the subse- quent liquefaction of the adhering surfaces. The change which next ensues is the concentration of the vascular canals towards some one point; for example, the centre of the shaft in a long, or the mid-point of a flat bone, and here i]\epuncturri ossificationis, or centre of ossifica- tion, is established. What determines the vascular concentration now alluded to, is a question not easily solved, but that it takes place is certain, and the vascular punctum is the most easily demonstrable of all the phenomena of ossification. During the formation of the punctum ossificationis, changes begin to be apparent in the cartilage cells. Originally they are simple nucleated iiTiun) ’anSo i^ich in diameter), having a rounded form. As growth proceeds, they become elongated in their figure, and it is then perceived that each cell contjiins two and often three nucleoli, around which smaller cells are in progress of formation. If we ex- amine them nearer to the punctum ossificationis, we find that the young or secondary cells have each attained the size of the parent cell of an inch), the membrane of the parent cell has disappeared, and the young cells are separated to a short distance by freshly effused inter- cellular substance. Nearer still to the punctum ossificationis a more remarkable change has ensued, the energy of cellule reproduction has6 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. Fiff. 2 * A % as © e 8 €.3 •J (Ss % ^ i} .

By one other repetition of the same process, each cell producing four, or five, or six young cells, a cluster is formed, con- taining from thirty to fifty cells. These clusters lie in immediate relation with the punctum ossificationis; they are oval in figure (about in length by in breadth), and placed in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the bone. The cells composing the cluster lie transversely with regard to its axis. In the first instance they are closely compressed, but by degrees are parted by a thin layer of inter- cellular substance, and each cluster is separated from neighbouring Fig. 4.* clusters by a broader layer of an inch) of intercellular substance. Such are the changes which occur in cartilage preparatory to the for- mation of bone. Ossification is accomplished by the formation of very fine and deli- cate fibres within the intercellular substance; this process commences at the punctum ossificationis, and extends from that point through every part of the bone, in a longitudinal direction in long, and in a radiated manner in flat bones. Starting from the punctum ossificationis, the fibres embrace each cluster of cells, and then send branches between the individual cells of each group. In this manner the network, characteristic of bone, is formed, while the cells by their conjunction • The same cartilage at the scat of ossification; the clusters of cells arc arranged in coiumns; the intercellular spaces between the columns being ^nzVo of an inch in breadth. To the right of the figure osseous fibres are seen occu- pying the intercellular spaces, at first bounding the clusters laterally, then split- ting them longitudinally, and encircling each separate cell. The greater opacity of the right-hand border is duo to a threefold cause, the increase of osseous fibres, the opacity of the contents of the cells, and the multiplication of oil- globules. In the lower part of the figure some attempt has been made to show the texture of the colls.o DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. constitute the permanent areolae and Haversian canals. With a high magnifying power, the delicate ossific fibres here alluded to are seen themselves to be composed of minute cells having an elliptical form and central nuclei. These cells attract into their interior the cal- careous salts of the blood, and their nuclei become developed, as I believe, into the future corpuscles of Purkinje. It is possible also that some of the cartilage cells become corpuscles of Purkinje in the fully developed bone. During the progress of the phenomena above described, the contents of the cells undergo certain changes. At first, their contents are transparent, then they become granular, and still later opaque, from the presence of amorphous matter mingled with nuclei, nucleoli, and the remains of secondary cells. In the latter state they also contain an abundance of minute oil-globules. These latter increase in size as the ossific changes advance, and in the newly formed osseous areolae they are very numerous and have attained the ordinary size of adipose cells. Cartilaginification is complete in the human embrjm at about the sixth week; and the first point of ossification is observed in the clavicle at about the seventh week. Ossification commences at the centre, and thence proceeds towards the surface ; in flat bones the osse- ous tissue radiates between two membranes from a central point to- wards the periphery, in short bones from a centre towards the circum- ference, and in long bones from a central portion, diapltysis, towards a secondary centre, epiphysis, situated at each extremity. Large pro- cesses, as the trochanters, are provided with a distinct centre of development, which is named apophysis. The growth of bone in length takes place at the extremity of the diaphysis, and in bulk by fresh deposition on the surface; while the medullary canal is formed and increased by absorption from within. The period of ossification is different in different bones; the order of succession may be thus arranged:— During the fifth week, ossification commences in the clavicle, lower jaw, and upper jaw. During the sixth week, in the femur, humerus, tibia, radius, and ulna. During the seventh and eighth weeks, in the fibula, frontal, occi- pital, sphenoid, ribs, parietal, temporal, nasal, vomer, palate, vertebne, first three pieces of sacrum, malar, metacarpus, metatarsus, third phalanges of the hands and feet, and ilium. During the third month, in the first and second phalanges of the hands and feet, lachrymal bone, and ischium. During the fifth month, in the mastoid portion of the temporal, ethmoid, inferior turbinated, sternum, os pubis, and last two pieces of sacrum. During the sixth month, in the body and odontoid process of the axis, and in the calcaneus. During the seventh month, in the astragalus.PERIODS OF OSSIFICATION. .9 During the tenth month, in the cuboid hone and os hyoides.

The ossicula auditus are the only bones completely ossified at birth; the vertebrae are not completed until the five-and-twentieth year.

The pelvic arch and lower extremities.10 ^ VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The vertebral column is the first and only rudiment of internal skeleton in the lower Vertebrata, and constitutes the type of that great division of the animal kingdom. It is also the first developed portion of the skeleton in man, and the centre around which all the other parts are produced. In its earliest formation it is a simple cartilaginous cylinder, surrounding and protecting the primitive trace of the nervous system; but, as it advances in growth and organi- sation, it becomes divided into distinct pieces, which constitute vertehrcB. The vertebrae are divided into true and false. The true vertebrae are twenty-four in number, and are classified, according to the three • regions of the trunk which they occupy, into cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. The false vertebrae consist of nine pieces united into two bones, the sacrum and coccyx. The arrangement of the vertebrae may be better comprehended by means of the accompanying table;— {7 Cervical, 12 Dorsal, 5 Lumbar. False vertebrae 9 ^ ^ Sacrum, ( 4 Loccj'x. Characters of a Vertebra.—A vertebra consists of a body, two laminae, a spinous process, two transverse processes, and four articular processes. The body is the solid part of the vertebra; and, bj* its arti- culation with adjoining vertebrae, gives strength and support to the trunk. It is flattened above and below, convex in front, and slightly concave behind. Its anterior surface is constricted around the middle, and pierced by a number of small openings which give passage to nutritious vessels. Upon its posterior surface is a single irregular opening, or several, for the exit of the venae basis vertebrae. The lammcB commence upon the sides of the posterior part of the body of the vertebra by two pedicles; they then expand; and, arching backwards, eficlose a foramen which serves for the protection of the 8])inal cord. The upper and lower borders of the laminae are rough for the attachment of the ligamenta subflava. The concavities above and below the pedicles are the intervertebral notches. The spinous process stands backwards from the angle of union of the laminae of the vertebra. It is the succession of these projecting processes along the middle line of the back, that has given rise to the common designation of the vertebral column, the spine. The use of the spinous process is for the attachment of muscles. The transverse processes project one at each side from the laminae of the vertebra; they are intended for the11 CERVICAL VERTEBR.E. attachment of muscles. The articular processes^ four in number, stand upwards and downwards from the laminae of the vertebra, to articulate with the vertebra above and below. Cervical Vertehrm. — In a cervical vertebra the body 5* is smaller than in the other regions; it is thicker be- fore than behind, broad from side to side, concave on the upper surface, and convex below; so that, when arti- culated, the vertebrae lock the one into the other. The lamincB are narrow and long, and the included spinal foramen large and triangu- lar. The superior interver- tebral notches are slightly deeper than the inferior; the inferior being the broadest. The spinous process is short and bifid at the extremity, increasing in length from the fourth to the seventh. The transverse processes are also short and bifid, and deeply grooved along the upper surface for the cervical nerves. Piercing the base of the transverse process is the vertebral forament, which gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, and vertebral plexus of nerves. The transverse processes in this region are formed by two small developments which proceed, the one from the side of the body, the other from the pedicle of the vertebra, and unite near their extremities to enclose the circular area of the vertebral fora- men. The anterior of these developments is the rudiment of a cervi- cal rib ; and the posterior, the analogue of the transverse processes in the dorsal region. The extremities of these developments are the anterior and posterior tvhereles of the transverse process. The articular processes are oblique; the superior looking upwards and backwards; and the inferior, downwards and forwards. There are three peculiar vertebrae in the cervical region;—The first, or atlas; the second, or axis; and the seventh, or vertebra promi- nens. The Atlas (named from supporting the head) is a simple ring of bone, without body, and composed of arches and processes. The an- * A'central cervical vertebra, seen upon its upper surface. 1.

The posterior arch is longer and more slender than the anterior, and flattened from above downwards ; at its mid- dle is a rudimentary spinous process; and upon its upper surface, near the articular proces- ses, a shallow groove + at each side, which re- presents a superior in- tervertebral notch, and supports the vertebral artery previously to its passage through the dura mater, and the first cervical nerve. The intervertebral notches are peculiar, from being situated beliind the ar- ticular processes, instead of before them as in the other vertebrae. The transverse processes are remarkably large and long, and pierced by the foramen for the vertebral artery. The articular processes are situated upon the most bulky and strongest part of the atlas. The superior are oval and concaye, and look inwards, so as to form a kind of cup for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are adapted to the nodding movements of the head; the inferior are circular, and nearly horizon- tal, to pemit of the rotatory movements. Upon the inner face of the lateral mass which supports the articular processes, is a small tubercle at each side, to which the extremities of the transverse ligament are attached, a ligament which divides the ring of the atlas into two un- equal segments; the smaller for receiving the odontoid process of the axis, and the latter to give passage to the spinal cord and its mem- branes. The Axis (vertebra dentata) is so named from having a process upon which the head turns as on a pivot. The body is of large size, and supports a strong process, the odontoid, whicli rises perpendicularly from its upper surface. The odontoid process presents two articulating surfaces; one on its anterior face, to articulate with the anterior arch of the atlas; the other on its posterior face, for the transverse liga- * The upper surface of the atlas. 1.

Fig. 7. ment; the latter surface constricts the base of the process, which has given rise to the term neck applied to this part. Upon each side of its apex is a rough depression, for the attachment of the alar ligaments ; and running down from its base on the anterior surface of the body of the vertebra a vertical ridge, with a depression at each side for the at- tachment of the longus colli muscle. The lamince are large and strong, and unite posteriorly to fonn a long and bifid spinous process, which is concave beneath. The transverse processes are quite rudimentary, not bifid, and project only so far as to enclose the vertebral foramen, which is directed obliquely out- wards instead of perpendicularly as in the other vertebrae. The su- perior articulating processes are situated upon the body of the vertebra on each side of the odontoid process. They are circular and nearly horizontal, having a slight inclination outwards. The inferior articu- lating processes look downwards and forwards, as do the same processes in the other cervical vertebrae. The superior intervertebral notch is remarkably shallow, and lies behind the articular process as in the atlas. The lower surface of the body is convex, and is received into the concavity upon the upper surface of the third vertebra. The Vertebra prominens, or seventh cervical, approaches in character to the upper dorsal vertebrae. It has received its designation from having a very long spinous process, which is single and terminated by a tubercle, and forms a considerable projection on the back part of the neck ; to the extremity of this process the ligamentum nuchae is at- tached. The transverse processes are but slightly grooved along the upper surface, have each a small foramen for the transmission of the vertebral vein, and present only a rudimentary bifurcation at their extremity. Sometimes the anterior tubercle represents a small but distinct rib. Dorsal VerteJjrce.—The body of a dorsal vertebra is as long from before backwards as from side to side, particularly in the middle of the dorsal region; it is thicker behind than before, and marked on each side by two lialf-articulating surfaces for the heads of two ribs.

The spinous process is long, prismoid, directed very obliquely down- wards, and terminated by a tubercle. The transverse processes are large and strong, and directed obliquelj’" back- wards. Upon the an- terior and superior as- pect of their summits is a small facet for the articulation of the tubercle of a rib. The articular processes are ver- tical, the superior facing directly backwards, and the inferior directly forwards. The peculiar vertebrae in the dorsal region are the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first dorsal vertebra approaches very closely in character to the last cervical. The body is broad from side to side, and concave above. The superior articular processes are oblique, and the spinous process horizontal. It has an entire articular surface for the first rib, and a half surface for the second. The ninth dorsal vertebra has only one half articular surface at each side. The tenth has a single entire articular surface at each side. The eleventh and twelfth have each a single entire articular surface at each side; they approach in character to the lumbar vertebras; their transverse processes are very short, trifid at their summits, and have no articu- lation with the corresponding ribs. The transverse processes of the twelfth dorsal vertebra are quite rudimentary, and its inferior articular processes look outwards. Lumbar Vertebra.—These are the largest pieces of the vertebral column. The body is broad and large, and thicker before than behind. The pedicles very strong; the lamina short, thick, and broad; the in- ferior intervertebral notches very large, and the spinal foramen large and oval. The spinous 'process is thick and broad. The transverse processes (costiform processes) are slender, pointed, and directed only slightly backwards. The superior articular processes are concave, and * A lateral view of a dorsal vertebra. 1.

Projecting backwards and upwards from the supe- rior articular process is a short and flattened tu- pig, g.* bercle or posterior trans- verse process, and in a strongly marked verte- bra there is not unfre- quently at the base of this a smaller tubercle which has a direction downwards. The last lumbar vertebra dif- fers from the rest in having the body very much bevelled poste- riorly, so as to be thick in front and thin behind, and the transverse process thick and large. General Considerations.—Viewed as a whole, the vertebral column represents two pyramids applied base to base, the superior being formed by all the vertebrae from the second cervical to the last lum- bar, and the inferior by the sacrum and coccyx. Examined more at- tentively, it will be seen to be composed of four irregular pyramids, applied to each other by their smaller extremities and by their bases. The smaller extremity of the uppermost pyramid is formed by the axis, or second cervical vertebra; and its base, by the first dorsal. The second pyramid is inverted; having its base at the first dorsal, and the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually enlarges to the fifth lumbar. The fourth pyramid is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. The bodies of the vertebra are broad in the cervical region; nar- rowed almost to an angle in the middle of the dorsal, and again broad in the lumbar region. The arches are broad and imbricated in the cervical and dorsal regions, the inferior border of each overlapping the superior of the next; in the lumbar region an interval is left between them. A considerable interval exists between the cranium and atlas, and another between the Last lumbar vertebra and sacrum. The spinous processes are horizontal in the cervical, and become gradually oblique in the upper part of the dorsal region. In the middle of the dorsal region they are nearly vertical and imbricated, and towards its lower part assume the direction of the lumbar spines, which are quite horizontal. The transverse processes developed in * A lateral view of a lumbar vertebra. 1. The body. 2. Tho pedicle. 3. The superior intervertebral notch. 4. Tho inferior intervertebral notch. 5.

In the dorsal region they project obliquely backwards, and diminish suddenly in length in the eleventh and twelfth vertebrm where they are very small. In the lumbar region they increase to the middle transverse process, and again subside in length to the last. The transverse processes consist essentially of two parts, the ante- rior of which in the dorsal region is the rib, while the posterior retains the name of the transverse process. In the cervical region these two elements are quite apparent, both by their different points of at- tachment to the vertebra, and by the vertebral foramen which divudes them at their base. In the lumbar region the so-called transverse processes are in reality lumbar ribs, while the transverse processes will be found behind them in a rudimentarj' state, developed, like the true transverse processes in the cervical region, from the superior ar- ticular processes. When the anterior and posterior transverse pro- cesses are examined in relation with each other, they will be observed to converge; if they were prolonged they would unite as in the cervical region and enclose a foramen, or they would rest in con- tact as in the dorsal region, or become consolidated as in the forma- tion of the sacrum. Moreover, the posterior transverse processes are directed upwards, and if they were prolonged, they would come into contact with a small tubercle which is found at the base of the poste- rior transverse process (in strongly marked vertebrae) in the vertebra above. This junction would form a posterior intervertebral foramen, as actually occurs in the sacrum. In brief, the lumbar vertebrae ex- hibit those transitional changes which are calculated, by an easy gra- dation, to convert separate vertebrae into a solid bone. The transverse processes of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae are very inter- esting in a transcendental point of view, as exhibiting a tendency which exists obscurely in all the rest, namely, to trifurcate. Now, supposing these three branches to be lengthened in order to fulfil their purposes, the anterior would constitute the articulation or union with a rib, while the superior and inferior would join similar branches in the vertebra above and below, and so form the posterior intervertebral foramen. The intercertahral foramina formed by the juxtaposition of the notches are smallest in the cervical region, [and gradually increase to the last luiTibar. On either side of the spinous processes, and extend- ing the whole length of the column, is the vertebral groove^ which is shallow and broad in the cervical, and deeper and narrower in the dorsal and lumbar regions. It lodges the principal muscles of the back. Viewed from the side, the vertebral column presents several curves, the principal of which is situated in the dorsal region, the concavit_v looking forwards. In the cervical and lumbar regions the column is convex in front; and in the pelvis an anterior concave curve is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Besides the antero-posterior curves, aDEVELOPMENT OF VERTEBR-®. 17 slight lateral curve exists in the dorsal region, having its convexity towards the right side. Development.—The vertebrae are developed hy three primaiy and five secondary centres or epiphyses. The primary centres are, one for each lamella, and one for the body; the epiphyses, one for the apex of the spinous process, one for that of each transverse process, and one for the upper and under surface of the body. Exceptions to this mode of development are met with in the atlas, axis, vertebra pro- minens, and lumbar vertebras. The atlas has four centres: one for each lateral mass, one (sometimes two) for the anterior arch, and one for the centre of the posterior arch. The axis has five: one (some- times twp) for the body, two for the odontoid process, appearing side by side in its base, and one for each lamella. The vertebra proininens has two additional centres for the anterior or costal segments of the transverse processes, and the lumbar vertd)r(e two for the posterior segments of the transverse processes. The primary centres of the vertebrae make their appearance during the seventh or eighth week of embryonic existence, the lamella being somewhat in advance of that for the body. From the former are pro- duced the spinous, transverse, and articular processes, and the sides of the body; they unite, to complete the arch, one year after birth, and with the body- during the fifth year. The epiphyses, for the extremi- ties of the spinous and transverse processes, make their appearance at fifteen or sixteen, and become united between twenty and twenty- five. The epiphyses of the body are somewhat later in appearance, and are consolidated between the periods of twenty-five and thirty years of age. The ossific centres for the lateral masses of the atlas, appear at the same time with those of the other vertebrae; they unite posteriorly at the end of the second year, by the intervention of tlie centre for the posterior arch. The one or two centres of the anterior arch appear during the first year, and become consolidated with the lateral pieces during the fifth or sixth year. The aocis develops its lateral pieces at the same time with the rest of the vertebrae; they join posteriorly soon after birth, and with the body during the fourth or fifth year. The centres for the body and odontoid process appear during the sixth month, and are consolidated during the third year. The body of the axis is more largely developed at birth than that of the other ver- tebrae. The costal segments of the vertebra prominens appear during the second month, and become united to the body at the fifth or sixth year. These processes sometimes remain permanently separate, and constitute a cervical rib. The transverse process of the first lumltar vertebra has sometimes a distinct centre, which may remain per- manently separate, in that case forming a lumbar rib. The ossification of the arches of the vertebrae commences from above, and proceeds gradually downwards; hence arrest of develop- ment gives rise to spina bifida, generally in the loins. Ossification of the bodies, on the contrary, commences from the centre, and proceeds cSACRUM. 18 from that point towards the extremities of the column; hence im- perfection of the bodies occurs either in the upper or lower ver- tebrae. Attachment of Mmcles. — To the atlas are attached ten pairs of muscles; the longus colli, rectus anticus minor, rectus lateralis, rectus posticus minor, obliquus superior and inferior, splenius colli, levator anguli scapulae, first interspinales, and first intertransversales. To the axis are attached twelve pairs; viz. the longus colli, inter- transversales, obliquus inferior, rectus posticus major, supraspinalis, interspinales, semi-spinalis colli, multifidus spinae, levator anguli sca- pulae, splenius colli, transversalis colli, and scalenus posticus. To the remaining vertebra collectively, thirty-three pairs; y\z. pos- teriorly, the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboi- deus minor and major, serratus posticus superior and inferior, splenius, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, transversalis colli, trachelo-mastoideus, complexus, semi-spinalis dorsi and colli, multifidus spinae, supraspinalis, interspinales, intertransver- sales, levatores costarum; anteriorly, the rectus anticus major, longias colli, scalenus anticus and posticus, psoas magnus, psoas parvus, quad- ratus lumborum, diaphragm, obliquus internus and transversalis. The Sacrum is a triangular bone, situated at the lower extremitj'- of the vertebral column, and formed by the consolidation of five false vertebrae. It is divisible into an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral and a superior border, and an inferior extremity. The anterior surface is concave, and marked by four transverse lines, which indicate its original constitution of five separate pieces. At the extremities of these lines, on each side, are the four anterior sacral foramina, which diminish in size from above downwards, and transmit the anterior sacral nerves. The projection of the superior piece is the sacro-vertebral angle or promontory. The posterior surface is narrower than the anterior and convex. Upon the middle line is a rough crest formed by the rudiments of four spinous processes, the fifth remaining undeveloped and exposing the lower termination of the sacral canal. Immediately external to and parallel with the median crest, is a range of five small tubercles which represent the posterior tranverse processes of the true vertebrae; beyond these is a shallow groove in which the four posterior sacral foramina open, and-farther outwards, a range of five tubercles corresponding with the anterior or costal transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra;. The lowest pair of the posterior transverse tubercles bound on each side the termination of the sacral canal, and send each a process down- wards to articulate with the coccyx. The two descending processes are the sacral cornua. The posterior sacral foramina are smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior sacral nerves. Of the anterior transverse tubercles the j^rs/coiTesponds with the angle of the superior border of the bone ; the second is small, and enters into the formationSACRUM. 19 of the sacro-iliac articulation; the third is large, and gives attachment to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament'; the fourth fifth are smaller, and serve for the attachment of thesacro-ischiatic ligaments. The lateral border of the sacrum presents superiorly a broad and ear-shaped (auri- cular) surface to articulate with the iliiun ; and infe- riorly a sharp edge, to which the greater and lesser sacro- ischiatic ligaments are at- tached. On the mperior border, in the middle line, is an oval articular surface, which corresponds with the under patt of the body of the last lumbar vertebra; and on each side a broad trian- gular simface, which supports the lumbo-sacral nerve and psoas magnus muscle. Immediately behind the vertebral articular sur- face is the trianguhar entrance of the sacral canal; and on each side of this opening an articular process, which looks backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae. In front of each articular process is an intervertebral notch. The inferior ex- tremity of the bone presents a small oval surface which articulates with the coccyx; and on each side a notch, which, with a corresponding notch in the upper border of the coccyx, forms the foramen for the transmission of the fifth sacral nerve. The sacrum presents some variety in respect of curvature, and of the number of pieces •which enter into its structure. The curve is often very slight, and is situated only near the lower part of the bone ; while in other subjects it is considerable, and occurs at the middle of the sacrum. The sexual differences in the sacrum relate to its greater breadth, and the greater angle which it forms with the rest of the ver- tebral column in the female, rather than to any peculiarity in shape. It is sometimes composed of six pieces, more rarely of four, and, occa- sionally, the first and second pieces remain permanently separate. * The sacrum seen upon its anterior surface. 1, 1.

Development.—By twenty-one points of ossification; five for each of the three first pieces, viz. one for the body, one for each lateral por- tion, and one for each lamina; and three for each of the two last, namely, one for the body, and one for each lateral portion. In the progress of growth, and after puberty, fourteen epiphysal centres are added, namely, two for the surfaces of each body, one for each auricu- lar surface, and one for the thin edge of each literal border. Ossifica- tion begins in the bodies of the sacral pieces somewhat later than in those of the true vertebrae; the first three appearing during the eighth and ninth week, and the last two at about the middle of intra-uterine existence. Ossification of the lamellae takes place during the interval between the sixth and the ninth month. The epiphyses for the upper and under surface of the bodies are developed during the interval be- tween the fifteenth and eighteenth year; and for the auricular and marginal piece, after twenty. The two lower vertebral pieces, although the last to appear, are the first to be completed (between the fourth and fifth year), and to unite by their bodies. The union of the bodies takes place from below upwards, and finishes between the twenty- fifth and the thirtieth year, with the first two pieces. Articulations,—With four bones; the last lumbar vertebra, ossa innominata, and coccyx. Attachment of Musdes.—To seven pairs; in front the pyriformis, on the side the coccygeus, and l>ehind the gluteus maximus, latissimus dorsi, longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, and multifidus spinae. The Coccyx (xokkv^ cuckoo, from resembling a cuckoo’s beak) is composed of four small pieces, which foim the caudal termination of the vertebral column. The superior piece is broad, and expands late- rally into two transverse processes; it is surmounted bj’' an oval arti- cular surface and two cornua, the former to articulate with the apex of the sacrum, and the latter with the sacral cornua. The lateral wings sometimes become connected with the sacrum, and convert the notches for the fifth pair of sacral nerves into foramina. The remaining three pieces diminish in size from above downwards. Development.—By four centres, one for each piece. Ossification commences in the first piece soon after birth; in the second, between five and ten years; in the third, between ten and fifteen; and in the fourth, between fifteen and twenty. The pieces unite at an earlier period than” the bodies of the sacrum, the first two pieces first, then the third and fourth, and lastly the second and third. Between forty and sixty years, the coccyx becomes consolidated with the sacrum; this event taking place later in the female than in the male. Articulations.—With the s.acrum. Attachment of Muscles.—To three pairs, and one single muscle ; gluteus maximus, coccygeus, posterior fibres of the levator ani, and sphincter ani.OCCIPITAL BONE. •21 OF THE SKULL. The skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, is divisible into two parts,—the cranium and the face; the former being adapted, by its form, structure, and strength, to contain and protect the brain, and the latter the chief organs of sense. The Cranium is composed of eight separate bones; viz. the Occipital, Two temporal, Two parietal, Sphenoid, Frontal, Ethmoid. Occipital Bone.—This bone is situated at the posterior part and Fig. 11.* base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisible into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles.

In the middle of the ridge is a projection, called the ex- ‘ i ternal occipital protuberance; and descending from it a small vertical ' s ridge, the spine. Above and below the superior curved line the sur- t face is rough, for the attachment of muscles. About three-quarters of i an inch below this line is another transverse ridge, the inferior curved t line, and beneath the latter the foramen magnum. On each side of i the foramen magnum, nearer to its anterior than its posterior segment, 1 and encroaching somewhat upon the opening, is an oblong articular surface, the condyle, for articulation with the atlas. The condjdes approach towards each other anteiiorly, and their articular surfaces look downwards and outwards. Directly behind each condyle is an irregular fossa, and a small opening, the posterior condyloid foramen, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the condyle is the anterior condyloid foratnen, for the hypoglossal nerve ; and on the outer side of each condyle a projecting ridge, the transverse process, excavated in front by a notch which forms part of the jugular fora- men. In front of the foramen magnum is a thick square mass, tlie basilar process, and in the centre of the basilar process a small tubercle for the attachment of the superior and middle constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Internal Surface. — Upon the .internal surface is a crucial ridge, which divides the bone into four fossae; the two superior or cerebral fossae lodging the posterior lobes of the cerebrum; and the two in- ferior or cerebellar, the lateral lobes of the cerebellum. The superior arm of the crucial ridge is grooved for the superior longitudinal sinus, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri; the inferior arm is sharp and prominent for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and slightly grooved for the two occipital sinuses. The transverse ridge gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and is deeply grooved for the ; lateral sinuses. At the point of meeting of the four arms is a pro- , jection, the internal occipital protuberance, which corresponds with the i similar process situated upon the external surface of the bone. The i convergence of the four grooves forms a slightly depressed fossa, upon 1 which rests the torcular Herophili. In the centre of the basilar por- ! tion of the bone is the foramen magnum, oblong in form, and larger behind than before, transmitting the spinal cord, spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral arteries. Upon the lateral margins of the fora- men magnjim are two rough eminences, which give attachment to the odontoid ligaments, and immediately above these the openings of the anterior condyloid foramina. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, grooved on its surface for supporting the medulla oblongata, and along each lateral border for the inferior petrosal si- nuses. On each side of the foramen magnum is a groove, for the termination of the lateral sinus; a smooth surface, which forms part of the jugular fossa; and a projecting process, which divides the two, and is called the jugular eminence. Into the jugular fossa will be seen opening the posterior condyloid foramen. The superior borders are very much serrated, and assist in formingOCCIPITAL BONE. 23 the lambdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, hut not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by means of the additamentiun suturm lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and the side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of Fig. 12 * the temporal bone, and the intermediate space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or fora- men lacerum postcrius. The angles of the occipital bone are the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is called the posterior fontaneUc. The inferior angle is the articular extremity of the basilar process. The lateral angles at each side project into that • The internal surface of the occipital hone. 1. The left cerebral fossa. 2.

Development.— By seven centres; four for the four parts of the ex- panded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the expanded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae; at birth the four remaining pieces are distinct; they are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphe- noid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs: to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis; to the superior curved line, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the transverse pro- cess, the rectus lateralis; and to the basilar process, the rectus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle constrictor muscles.

Upon its inner surface t it is deeply channelled by a groove for the trunk of the arteria menin- gea media. This groove is frequently converted into a canal. The s posterior inferior angle is thick, and presents a broad and shallow [ groove for the lateral sinus. ! Development.—By a single centre. Ossification commences at the parietal eminence at the same time with the bodies of the vertebrae. Articulations.—With bones; with the opposite parietal bone, the occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles.—To one only,—the temporal. The occi- pito-frontalis glides over its upper surface. Frontal Bone.—The frontal bone bears some resemblance in form to the under valve of a scallop shell. It is situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead, and assists in the construc- tion of the roof of the orbits and nose. Hence it is divisible into a superior or frontal portion, and an inferior or orbito-nasal portion. Each of these portions presents for examination an external and inter- nal surface, borders, and processes. Eddernal Surface.—At about the middle of each lateral half of the frontal portion is a 'gvo]eci\on,i\ie frontal eminence. Below these points are the superciliary ridges, large towards their inner termination, and - becoming gradually smaller as they arch outwards : they support the eyebrows. Beneath the superciliary ridges are the sharp and prominent arches which form the upper margin of the orbits, the supra-orbital ridges. Externally the supra-orbital ridge terminates in the external angular process, and internally in the internal angular process; at the inner third of this ridge is a notch, sometimes converted into a fo- ramen, the supra-orbital notch, which gives passage to the supra-orbi- tal artery, veins, and nerve. Between the two superciliary ridges is a rough projection, the nasal tuberosity; this portion of the bone denotes by its prominence the situation of the frontal sinuses. Extending upwards and backwards from the external angular process is a sharp ridge, the commencement of the temporal ridge, and beneath this a depressed sutface that forms part of the temporal fossa. The orbito-nasal portion of the bone consists of two thin processes, i the orbital plates, which fonn the roof of the orbits, and of an inter- vening notch which lodges the ethmoid bone, and is called tlie ethmoidal fissure. The edges of the ethmoidal fissure arc hollowed into cavities, which, by their union with the ethmoid bone, complete the ethmoidal cells; and, crossing these edges transversely, are two small grooves, sometimes canals, which open into the orbit b}*^ the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina. At the anterior tennination of these edges are the irregular openings which lead into the frontal sinuses; and be-27 FRONTAL BONE, tween the two internal angular processes, is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a projecting process, the nasal spine. Upon each orbital plate, immediately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which lodges the lachrymal gland; Fig. 15.* and beneath the internal angular process a small pit, sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle is attached. Internal Surface.—Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri and the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid bone, the foramen ccecum. This opening lodges a process of the dura mater, and occasionally gives passage to a small vein which communicates with the nasal veins. On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the glandulse Pacchioni, and on the orbital plates a number of irregular pits called digital fossae, which correspond with the convolutions of the anterior lobes of the • The external surface of the frontal bone. 1.

The inferior border is thin, irregular, and squamous, and articulates with the sphenoid bone. Development.—By two centres, one for each lateral half. Ossifica- tion begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life.

Temporal Bone.—The temporal hone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The Squamous portion, forming the anterior part of the hone, is thin, ti-anslucent, and contains no diploe. Upon its external surface it is smooth, to give attachment to the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle, and has projecting from it an arched and length- Fig. 17.* ened process, the zygoma.

The process of bone which is continued from the tubercle of the zygoma into the eminentia articu- laris is the inferior root of the zygoma. The superior root is con- tinued upwards from the upper border of the zygoma, and forms the posterior part of the temporal ridge, serving by its projection to mark the division of the squamous from the mastoid portion of the bone; and the middle root is continued directly backwards, and terminates abruptly at a narrow fissure, the fissura Glaseri. The irderriol sur- faee of the squamous portion is marked by several shallow fossm, which con’espond with the convolutions of the cerebrum, and by a furrow for the posterior branch of the arteria meningea media. The superior, or squamous border, is very thin, and bevelled at the expense of the inner surface, so as to overlap the lower and arched border of the parietal bone. The inferior border is thick, and dentated to arti- culate with the spinous process of the sphenoid bone. The Mastoid portion iovms the posterior part of the bone; it is thick, and hollowed between its tables into a loose and cellular diploe. Upon its external surface it is rough for the attachment of muscles, and contrasts strongly with the smooth and polished-like surface of the squamous portion: every part of this surface is pierced by small fora- mina, which give passage to minute arteries and veins; one of these openings, oblique in its direction, of large size, and situated near the posterior border of the bone, the inastoid foramen, transmits a vein to the lateral sinus. This foramen is not unfrequently situated in the occipital bone. The inferior part of this portion is round and ex- panded, the mastoid process, and excavated in its interior into numerous cells, which form a part of the organ of hearing. In front of the mastoid process, and between the superior and middle roots of the z3'goma, is the large oval opening of the meatus auditorius eaternus, surrounded by a rough lip, the processus auditorius. Directh^ to the inner side of, and partly concealed by the mastoid process, is a deep groove, the digastric fossa; and a little more intemallj' the occipital groove, which lodges the occipital arterJ^ Upon its internal surface the mastoid portion presents a broad and shallow groove {J'ossa sigmoidea) for the lateral sinus, and terminating in this groove the internal opening of the mastoid foramen. The supei-ior border of the mastoid portion is dentated; and its posterior border, thick and less serrated, articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone. The meatus auditorius extermis is a slightly''cimved canal, somewhat more than half an inch in length, longer along its lower than its upper wall, and directed obliquely inwards and forwards. The canal is nan-ower at the middle than at each extremity, is broadest in its horizontal diameter, and terminates upon the outer wall of the t3'mp.a- num by an abrupt oval border. Within the margin of this border is a groove for the insertion of the membrana tj-mpani. The Petrous portion of the temporal bone is named from its extreme hardness and density. It is a three-sided pyramid, projecting hori-31 TEMPORAL BONE. zontally forwards into the base of the skull, the base being applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, and the apex being received into the triangular interval between the spi- nous process of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital bone. For convenience of description it is divisible into three sur- faces—anterior, posterior, and basilar; and three borders—superior, anterior, and posterior. Surfaces- — The anterior surface., forming the posterior boundary of the middle fossa of the interior of the base of the skull, presents for examination from base to apex, first, an eminence caused by the pro- jection of the perpendicular semicircular canal; next, a groove lead- ing to an irregular oblique opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the transmission of the pe- trosal branch of the Vidian nerve; thirdly, another and smaller oblique foramen, imme- diately beneath the pre- ceding, for the passage of the nervus petrosus superficialis minor, a branch of Jacobson’s nerve; and, lastly, a large foramen near the apex of the bone, the termination of the caro- tid canal.

Above the meatus auditorius in- ternus is a small oblique fissure, and a minute foramen; the former lodges a process of the dura mater, and the foramen gives passage to a small vein. Further outwards, towards the mastoid portion of the bone, is a small slit, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone; this is the aquceductus vestibuli, and transmits a small artery and vein of the ves- tibule and a process of dura mater. Below the meatus, and partly concealed by the margin of the posterior border of the bone, is the aquceductus cocIde<e, through which passes a vein from the cochlea to the internal jugular vein, and a process of dura mater. The meatus auditorius internus is about one-third of an inch in depth, and pursues a slightly oblique course in relation to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, but a course directl}’^ outwards in relation to the cranium. At the bottom of the meatus, and upon its anterior aspect, is a reniform fossa, the concave border of which is directed towards the entrance of the meatus. The reniform fossa Fig. 19.* c A is divided into an upper and lower compartment b}' a sharp ridge, which is prolonged for some distance upon the anterior wall of the meatus, and sometimes as far as its aperture; in either case it marks ♦ A.

Along the convexity of the reniform fossa, and arranged in a curved line from above downwards, are four or five openings, the two upper ones being the largest, and occupying the superior compartment of the reniform fossa, and the two or three inferior ones, smaller than the upper, the inferior com- partment. Behind the latter, at the distance of a line and a half, and on the posterior wall of the meatus, is a cluster of three or four oblique openings, two of which are minute. The inferior and larger com- partment of the reniform fossa presents a well-marked spiral groove, which commences on the convex border of the fossa, immediately below the line of openings above described, and, sweeping round the con- vexity of the inferior compartment, and becoming deeper as it proceeds, terminates by a small round aperture in the centre of the spire. The uppermost of the openings of the reniform fossa is the aperture of the aquaeductus Fallopii, and gives passage to the facial nerve. The rest are cul de sacs, pierced at the bottom by a number of minute foramina for the passage of filaments of the vestibular nerve, while the cluster of three openings on the posterior wall of the meatus are intended for single filaments of the same nerve. The spiral groove corresponds with the base of the cochlea, and being pierced by a number of minute foramina for filaments of the cochlear nerve, is named tractus spiralis foraminulentus. The opening in the centre of the spiral im- pression leads into a canal which occupies the central axis of the modiolus, and is thence called tiibulus centralis modioli. The basilar surface is rough and irregular, and enters into the formation of the under surface of the base of the skull. Projecting downwards, near its middle, is a long sharp spine, the styloid process, occasionally connected with the bone only by cartilage, and lost during maceration, particularly in the young subject. At the base of this process is a rough sheath-like ridge, into which the styloid process appears implanted, the vaginal process. In front of the vaginal pro- cess is a broad triangular depression, the glenoid fossa, bounded in front by the eminentia articularis, behind by the vaginal process, and externally by the rough lip of the processus auditorius. This fossa is divided transversely by the glenoid fissure (fissura Glased), which lodges the extremity of the processus gracilis of the malleus, and transmits the laxator tympani muscle, chorda tymp<ini nerve, and anterior tympanic artery. The surface of the fossa in front of this fissure is smooth, to articulate with the condyle of the lower jaw ; and that behind the fissure is rough, for the reception of a part of the parotid gland- At the extremity of the inner angle of the glenoid fossa is the foramen of the Eustachian tube; and separated from it by a thin Ijimella of bone, called processus cochleariformis, a small canal for the transmission of the tensor tympani muscle. Directly be- hind, and at the root of the styloid process, is the stylo-mastoid fora- men, the opening of exit of the facial nerve, and of entrance of the stylo-mastoid artery. Nearer the apex of the bone is a large oval • D34 TEMPORAL BONE. opening, the carotid foramen, the commencement of the carotid canal, which lodges the internal carotid artery and the carotid plexus. And between the stylo-mastoid and carotid foramen, in the posterior border, is an irregular excavation forming part of the jugular fossa for the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The proportion of the jugular fossa formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone is very different in different bones; but in all, the fossa presents a vertical ridge on its inner side, which cuts off a small portion from the rest. The upper part of this ridge forms a spinous projection, which is called jupidar process, the groove to the inner side of the ridge lodges the eighth pair of nerves, and the lower part of the ridge is the septum of division between the jugular fossa and the carotid foramen. Upon this portion of the ridge near the posterior margin of the carotid foramen is a small opening leading into a canal, which transmits the tympanic branch (Jacobson’s nerve) of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Between the jugular fossa and the stylo-mastoid foramen is another small opening leading into the canal for the passage of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve. Borders.—The superior border is sharp, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. It is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, and near its extremity is mai’ked by a smooth notch upon which reclines the fifth nerve. The anterior border is grooved for the Eustachian tube, and forms the posterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii; by its sharp extremity it gives attachment to the tensor tympani and levator palati muscles. The posterior border is grooved for the inferior petro- sal sinus, and excavated for the jugular fossa; it forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum posterius. Development.—By five centres; one for the squamous portion, one for the mastoid process, one for the petrous portion, one for the audi- tory process, which in the fcetus is a mere bony ring, incomplete supe- riorly, and serving for the attachment of the membrana tympani, anmdus memh-anm tympani; and one for the styloid process. Ossifi- cation occurs in these pieces in the following order: in the squamous portion immediately after the vertebrae, then in tlie petrous, tympanic, mastoid, and styloid. The tympanic ring is united by its extremities to the squamous portion during the last month of intra-uterine life; the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portions are consolidated during the first year ; and the styloid some years after birth. It not unfrequently happens that the latter remains permanently separate, or is prolonged by a series of pieces to the os hyoides, and so completes the hyoid arch. The subsequent changes in the bone are the increase of size of the glenoid fossa, the growth of the meatus auditorius extemus, the level- ling of the surfaces of the petrous portion, and the development of mastoid cells. Traces of the union of the petrous with the squamous portion of the bone are usually perceptible in the adult. Articulations.—With five bones : occipital, parietal, sphenoid, in- ferior maxillary, and malar.SPHENOID BONE. 35 Atiadiment of Muscles.—To fourteen: by tlie squamous portion, to the temporal; by the zygoma, to the masseter; by the mastoid por- tion, to the occipito-frontalis, splenius capitis, sterno-mastoid, trachelo- mastoid, digastricus and retrahens aurem; by the styloid process, to the stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, and two ligaments, the stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary; and by the petrous portion, to the levator palati, tensor tympani, and stapedius. Sphenoid Bone.—The sphenoid a wedge) is an irregular bone situated at the base of the skull, wedged between the other bones of the cranium, and entering into the formation both of the cranium . and face. It bears some resemblance, in form, to a bat with its wings extended, and is divisible into bodj’^, wings, and processes. The body forms the central mass of the bone, from which the wings rand processes are projected. From the upper and anterior part of the body extend on each side two small triangular plates—the lesser wings; ; from either side and expanding laterally are the greater wings ; pro- cceeding backwards from the base of the greater wings, the spinous pprocesses, and downwards, the pterj'goid processes. The body presents for examination a superior or cerebral surface, an aantero-inferior surface, and a posterior surface. Superior Surface.—At the anterior extremity of this surface is a ramall projecting plate, the ethmoidal spine, and spreading out on neither side the lesser wings. Behind the ethmoidal spine in the : middle line is a rounded elevation, the olivary process, which supports ! the commissure of the optic nerves; and on either side of the posterior r margin of this process is a tubercle, the middle clinoid process. Pass- ing outwards and forwards from the olivary process, are the optic foramina, which transmit the optic nerves and ophthalmic arteries. ! Behind the optic foramina are two sharp tubercles, the anterior clinoid i processes, which arc the inner terminations of the lesser wings. Be- ! neath these processes, on the sides of the olivary process, are two '■depressions* for the last turn of the internal carotid arteries. Behind •.the olivary process is the sella turcica (ephippium), the deep fossa vwhich lodges the pituitary gland and circular sinus; behind and some- • vvhat overhanging the sella turcica, is a broad rough plate (dorsum • ?phippii) bounded at each angle by a tubercle, the posterior clinoid. nrocesses; and behind this plate an inclining surface (clivus Blumen- oachii), which is continuous with the basilar process of the occipital toone. On either side of the sella turcica is a broad groove {carotid) .vhich lodges the internal carotid artery, the cavernous sinus, and the ■orbital nerves. Immediately external to this groove, at the junction ■of the greiiter wings with the body, are four foramina ; the first is a : jroad interval, the sphenoidal fissure, which separates the greater and * These depressions are occa.“ionally, as in a skull before mo, converted into mina by the extension of a short bony pillar from the middle to the anterior ' dinoid process.36 SPHENOID BONE. lesser wings, and transmits the third, fourth, the three branches of the ' ophthalmic division of the fifth and the sixth nerves, and the ophthal- ! mic vein. Behind and beneath this fissure is the foramen rotundum ' for the superior maxillary nerve ; and still farther back, in the base of i the spinous process, the foramen ovale for the inferior maxUlarj' nerve, ; Via. 20.* a arteria meningea parva, and nervus petrosus superficialis minor. Be- hind the foramen ovale, near the apex of the spinous process, is the foramen spinosum for the arteria meningea medea. Upon the antero-inferior surface of the sphenoid is a long flattened spine or crest, the superior part of which, crista sphenoidcdis, articulates with the central lamella of the ethmoid, while the inferior part longer and sharper, the rostrum sphenoidale, is intended to be inserted into the sheath formed by the upper border of the vomer.

The sphenoidal cells, which are absent in the young I subject, are divided by a median septum which is continuous with the j crista, and are partially closed by two thin plates of bone (frequently I broken away), the sphenoidal sponyy bones. On each side of the sphe- Fig 21.* I noidal cells are the- outlets of the optic foramina, sphenoidal fissures, 1 i and foramina rotunda, the lesser and greater wings ; and, below, the I pterj-goid processes. Upon the under surface of the body are two ' thin plates of bone (processus vayinales) proceeding from the base of the pterj'goid process at each side, and intended for articulation with I the borders of the vomer. On each of these plates, close to the root ^ of the pterygoid process, is a groove (sometimes a complete canal) con- ' verted into a canal by the palate bone, the pteryyo-palatine canal for the pterygo-palatine artery ; and traversing the roots of the pterygoid processes at their union with the body of the bone, are the two ptery- goid or Vidian canals, which give passage to the Vidian nerve and artery at each side. The posterior surface is flat and rough, and articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. In the adult this union is usually completed by bone ; from which circumstance the sphenoid, in con- junction with the occipital, is described by Soemmering and Meckel i-‘ IS a single bone, under the name of spheno-occipital.

The lesser wings (processes of Ingrassias) are thin and triangular, the base being attached to the upper and anterior part of the body of the sphenoid, and the apex extended outwards, and terminating in an acute point. The anterior border is irregularly serrated, the posterior being free and rounded, and received into the fissure of Sylvius of the cerebrum. The inner extremity of this border is the anterior clinoid process, which is supported by a short pillar of bone, giving attach- ment to a part of the common tendon of the muscles of the orbit. The lesser wing forms the posterior part of the roof of the orbit, and its base is traversed by the optic foramen. The greater wings present three surfaces ; a superior or cerebral, which forms part of the middle fossa of the base of the skull, an ante- rior sui’face which assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit, and an external surface divided into two parts by the pterygoid ridge. The superior part of the external surface enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, and the inferior portion forms part of the z3'gomatic fossa. The pterygoid ridge, dividing the two, gives attachment to the upper origin of the pterygoideus externus muscle. The spinous processes project backwards at each side from the base of the greater wings of the sphenoid, and are received into the angu- lar intervals between the squamous and petrous portions of the tem- poral bones. Piercing the base of each process is a large oval opening, the foramen ovale; nearer its apex a smaller opening, the foramen spinosum; and extending downwards from the apex a short spine, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and to the laxator tympani muscle. The external border of the spinous process is rough, to articulate with the lower border of the squamous portion of the temporal bone; the internal forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and is somewhat grooved for the reception of the Eustachian tube. The pterygoid processes descend perpendicularlj” from the base of the greater wings, and form in the articulated skull the lateral boun- daries of the posterior nares. Each process consists of an external and internal plate, and an anterior surface. The external plate is broad and thin, giving attachment, by its external surface, to the ex- ternal pterygoid muscle, and by its internal surface to the internal pterygoid. This plate is sometimes pierced by a foramen, which is not unfrequently formed by a process of communication passing between it and the spinous process. The internal pterj'goid plate is long and narrow, and terminated at its e.xtremity by a curved hook, the hamu- larprocess, around which plays tlie tendon of the tensor palati muscle. At the base of the internal pterygoid plate is a small oblong depres- sion, the scaphoid fossa, from which arises the circumtiexus or tensor palati muscle. The interval between the two pterj'goid plates is the pterygoid fossa ; and the two plates are separated inferiorly bj' an an- gular notch {palatine), which receives the tuberosity, or pterygoid pro-ETHMOID BONE. 39 cess, of the palate bone. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is broad near its base, and supports Meckel’s ganglion. The base of the process is pierced by the Vidian canal. Development.—By tivelr.e centres: four for the body, viz. two for its anterior (spheno-orbital), and two for its posterior part (spheno- temporal) ; four for the four wings ; two for the internal pterygoid plates, and two for the sphenoidal spongy bones. Ossification com- mences in the various pieces of the sphenoid in the following order:— greater alae, at about the same time with the other bones of the cranium; lesser aim and posterior body, at the end of the second month ; anterior body at the end of the third ; internal pterygoid plate and spongy bones, between the period of birth and the second year. Osseous union occurs first between the centres for the posterior body, and at about the same time between each centre of the anterior body and its corresponding (lesser) ala ; the third union takes place between the internal pterygoid plate and the greater ala ; the fourth between the two centres of the anterior body, and at the same time between the anterior and posterior body. This is the state of union at birth, the bone consisting of five centres, one being the body and lesser alae ; one, on each side, the great ala and internal pterygoid plate; and the remaining two the sphenoidal spongy bones. The greater alae unite with the body during the first year ; the spongy bones after puberty ; and the body of the sphenoid with the basilar process of the occipital bone between eighteen and twenty-five. Articulations.—With ttvelve bones ; that is, with all the bones of the head, and-five of the face, viz. the two malar, two palate, and the vomer. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve pairs : temporal, external ptery- goid, internal pterygoid, superior constrictor, tensor palati, laxator tympani, levator palpebrae, obliquus superior, superior rectus, internal rectus, inferior rectus, and external rectus. Ethmoid Bone.—The ethmoid {fiSfios, a sieve) is a square-shaped cellular bone, situated between the two orbits, at the root of the nose, and perforated upon its upper surface by a number of small openings, from which peculiarity it has received its name. It consists of a perpendicular lamella and two lateral masses. The perpendicular lamella is a thin central plate, which articulates with the vomer and cartihige of the septum, and assists in forming the septum of the nose. It is surmounted superiorly by a thick and strong process, the crista yalli, which projects into the cavity of the skull, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri. From the base of the anterior border of this process there project forward two small plates, alar processes, which are received into corresponding depres- sions in the frontal bone, and often complete posteriorly the foramen cfficum. On each side of the crista galli, upon the upper surface of the bone, is a thin and grooved plate perforated by a number of small openings, the cribriform lamella, which supports the bulb of the40 ETHMOID BONE, olfactory nerve, cind gives passage to its filaments, and to the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. In the middle of the groove of this P- 22 * lamella the foramina pierce the bone completely, but at either side they are the apertures of canals, which run for some distance in the sub- stance of the central lamella, inner wall of the lateral mass, and spongy bones. The opening for the nasal nerve is a narrow slit in the ante- rior part of the cribriform lamella, close to the crista galli. The crib- riform lamella serves to connect the lateral masses with the perpendicu- lar plate. The lateral masses (labyrinthi) are divisible into an internal and external sm-face, and four borders, superior, inferior, anterior, and pos- terior, The internal surface is rough and slightly convex, and forms the external boundary of the upper part of the nasal fossae. Towards the posterior border of this surface is a narrow horizontal fissure, the superior meatus of the nose, the upper margin of which is thin, and somewhat curled inwards ; hence it is named the superior turbinated bone (concha superior). Below the meatus is the convex surface of another thin plate, which is curled outwards, and forms the lower border of the mass, the middle turbinated bone (concha media). The external surface is quadrilateral and smooth, hence it is named os planum, and, from its thinness, lamina papyracea; it enters into the foimation of the inner wall of the orbit. The superior border is irregular and cellular, the cells being com- pleted by the edges of the ethmoidal fissure of the frontal bone. This border is crossed by two grooves, sometimes complete canals, opening into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina. The inferior border is formed internally by the lower border of the middle turbinated bone, and externally by a concave irregular fossa, the upper boundary of the middle meatus. The anterior border presents a number of incomplete cells, which are closed by the superior maxillary • The ethmoid bone seen from above and behind. 1. The central lamella. 2, 2.

The lateral masses are composed of cells, which are divided by a thin partition into anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The anterior, the most numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses, and open by means of an irregular and incomplete tubular canal, the infundibulum^ into the middle meatus. The posterior cells, fewer in number, open into the superior meatus. Development.—By three centres; one for each lateral mass, and one for the perpendicular lamella. Ossification commences in the lateral masses at about the beginning of the fifth month, appearing first in the os planum and then in the spongy bones. During the latter half of the first year after birth, the central lamella and lamina cribrosa begin to ossify, and are united to the lateral masses by the beginning of the second year. The cells of the ethmoid are developed in the course of the fourth and fifth year. Articulations.—With thhdeen bones; two of the cranium,—the frontal and sphenoid ; the rest of the face, viz. the nasal, superior maxillary, lachrymal, palate, the inferior turbinated, and the vomer. No muscles are attached to this bone. Nasal Bones.—The nasal (fig. 281 are two small quadrangular bones, forming by their union the bridge and base of the nose. Upon the upper surface they are convex, and pierced by a foramen for a small artery; on the under surface they are somewhat concave, and marked by a groove, which lodges the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. The superior border is narrow and thick, the inferior broad, thin, and irregular. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, the first ossific de- position making its appearance at the same time as in the vertebrae. Articulations.—With ybar bones : frontal, ethmoidal, nasal, and superior maxillary. Attachment of Muscles.—It has in relation with it the pyramidalis nasi, and compressor nasi ; but neither of these muscles is inserted into it. Superior maxillary Bones —The superior maxillary are the largest bones of the face, with the exception of the^ower jaw; they : form, by their union, the whole of the upper jaw, and assist in the 1 construction of the nose, the orbit, the cheek, and the palate. Each I bone is divisible into a body and four processes. BONES OF THE FACE. The face is composed of fourteen bones ; viz. the Two nasal. Two superior maxillary. Two lachrymal. Two malar. Two palate.

It presents for examination four sur- faces, external or facial, internal or nasal, posterior or zygomatic, and superior or orbital. The external, or facial surface, forms the anterior part of the bone; it is irregularly concave, and pre- sents a deep depression towards its centre, the caninefossa, which gives attachment to two muscles, the com- pressor nasi and levator anguli oris. Immediately above this fossa is the infra-orbital foramen, the termi- nation of the infra-orbital canal, transmitting the superior maxillary nerve and inffa-orbital artery ; and above the infra-orbital foramen, the lower margin of the orbit, continu- ous externally with the rough arti- cular surface of the malar process, and internally with a thick ascend- ing plate, the nasal process. Towards the middle line of the face this surface is bounded % the concave border of the opening of the nose, which is projected forwards at its inferior termination into a sharp process, forming, with a similar process of the opposite bone, the na- sal spine. Beneath the nasal spine, and above the two superior incisor teeth, is a slight depression, the incisive, or myrliform fossa, which gives origin to the depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle. The myrtiform fossa is divided from the canine fossa by a perpen- dicular ridge, corresponding with the direction of the root of the canine tooth. The inferior boundary of the facial surface is the alveolar process which contains the teeth of the upper jaw ; and it is separated from the zygomatic surface by a strong projecting eminence, the malar process.

The cavity of the antrum is somewhat triangular, corre- sponding in shape with the form of the body of the bone. Upon its inner wall are numerous grooves, lodging branches of the superior max- ilhiry nerve, and projecting into its floor several conical processes, corre- sponding with the roots of the first and second molar teeth. In front of the opening of the antrum is the strong ascending plate of the nasal process, marked inferiorly by a rough horizontal ridge (crista turbina- lis inferior), which gives attachment to the inferior turbinated bone. The concave depression immediately above this ridge corresponds with the middle meatus of the nose, and that below the ridge with the in- ferior meatus. Between the nasal process and the opening of the an- tnim, is a deep vertical groove (sulcus lachrymalis), which is converted into a canal by the lachrymal and inferior turbinated bone, and con- stitutes the nasal duct. The superior border of the nasal surface is irregularly cellular, and articulates with the lachrymal and ethmoid bone ; the posterior border is rough, and articulates with the palate bone ; the anterior border is sharp, and forms the free margin of the opening of the nose; and from the inferior border projects inwards a strong horizontal plate, the palate process. The posterior surface may be called zygomatic^ fi:om forming part of the zygomatic fossa; it is bounded externally by the malar process, and internally by a rough and rounded border, the tuberosity, which is pierced by a number of small foramina (foramina alveolaria posteriora), giving passage to the posterior dental nerves and branches of the superior dental artery. The lower part of this tuberosity presents a rough oval surface, to articulate with the palate bone, and immediately above and to the inner side of this articular surface a smooth groove, which forms part of the posterior palatine canal. The superior border is smooth and rounded to form the lower boundary of the spheno- maxillary fissure, and is marked by a notch, the commencement of the infra-orbital canal. The inferior boundary is the alveolar process, containing the last two molar teeth. The orbital surface is triangular and thin, and constitutes the floor of the orbit. It is bounded internally by an irregular edge, which articulates with the palate, ethmoid, and lachrymal bone; posteriorly, by the smooth border which enters into the formation of the spheno- maxillary fissure ; and, anteriorly, by a convex margin, partly smooth and partly rough, the smooth portion forming part of the lower border of the orbit, and the rough articulating with the malar bone. The middle of this surface is channelled by a deep groove and canal, the infra-orbital, which terminates at the infra-orbital foramen ; and near the root of the nasal process is a slight depression, marking the origin of the inferior oblique muscle of the eyeball. The four processes of the superior maxillary bone are the nasal, malar, alveolar, and palate. I he nasal process ascends by the side of the nose, to which it forms the lateral boundary, and articulates with the frontal and nasal bone.SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. 44 By its external surface it gives attachment to the levator labii supe- rioris alseque nasi, and to the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. Its internal surface contributes to form the inner wall of the nares, and is marked transversely by a horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis superior) which divides it into two portions, one above the ridge irregular and uneven, for giving attachment to and completing the cells of the la- teral mass of the ethmoid ; the other below, smooth and concave, cor- responding with the middle meatus. The posterior border is thick, and hollowed into a groove for the nasal duct. The margin of the nasal process, which is continuous with the lower border of the orbit, is sharp and marked by a small tubercle which serves as a guide to the introduction of the knife in the operation for fistula lachrymalis. The malar process, large and irregular, is situated at the angle of separation between the facial and zygomatic surfaces, and presents a triangular surface for articulation with the malar bone. The alveolar process forms the lower margin of the bone ; it is spongy and cellular in texture, and excavated into deep holes for the reception of eight teeth. The palate process is thick and strong, and projects horizontally inwards from the inner surface of the body of the bone. Superiorly, it is concave and smooth, and forms the floor of the nares ; inferiorly, it is also concave but uneven, and assists in the formation of the roof of the palate. This surface is marked by a deep groove, which lodges the posterior palatine nerve and artery. Its internal edge is raised into a ridge (crista nasalis), which, wdth a corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove for the reception of the vomer. The pro- longation of this ridge forwards beyond the level of the facial surface of the bone is the nasal spine. At the anterior extremity of its nasal surface is a foramen, which leads into a canal formed conjointly by the two superior maxillary bones, the anterior palatine canal. The termination of this canal is situated immediately behind the incisor teeth, hence it is also named the incisive foramen. Associated with the incisive openings and canal are two smaller canals, the naso-pala- tine, which, transmit the naso-palatine nerves. These canals are situated in the walls of the incisive canal, and terminate inferiorly in that canal, either by separate openings or conjoined. Development.—By four centres : one for the anterior part of the palate, and incisive portion of the alveolar process (the permanence of this piece constitutes the intermaxillary bone of animals); one for that portion of the bone lying internally to the infra-orbital canal and fora- men ; one for that portion lying externally to the infra-orbital groove and canal ; and one for the palate process. The superior maxillarj' bone is one of the earliest to shew signs of ossification, this process beginning in the alveolar process, and being associated with the early development of teeth. The early development of the alveolar process, and the consequent fusion at this point of the original pieces, explains the difficulties which have been felt by anatomists in determining the precise number of the ossifying centres of this bone.MALAR BONKS. 45 Articulations.—With nine bones; viz. with two of the cranium, and with all the bones of the face, excepting the inferior maxillary. These are, the frontal and ethmoid; nasal, lachrymal, malar, inferior tmrbinated, palate, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine: orbicularis palpebrarum, obliquus inferior oculi, levator labii superioris alteque nasi, levator labii supe- rioris proprius, levator anguli oris, compressor nasi, depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi, buccinator, masseter. Fig. 24.* Lachrymal Bones (os unguis, from an imagined resemblance to a finger nail).—The lachrymal is a thin oval-shaped plate of bone, situated at the anterior and inner angle of the orbit. It may be di- vided into an external and internal surface and four borders. The external surface is smooth and marked by a vertical ridge, the lachrymal crest, into two portions, one of which is flat and enters into the formation of the orbit, hence may be called the orbital portion; the other is concave, and lodges the lachrjTnal sac, hence, the lachrymal portion. The crest is expanded interiorly into a hook- shaped process (hamulus lachrymalis), which forms part of the outer boundary of the fossa lachrymalis. The internal surface is uneven, and completes the anterior ethmoid cells; it assists also in forming the wall of the nasal fossae and nasal duct. The four borders articulate with adjoining bones. Development.—By a single centre, appearing in the early part of the third month. Articulations.—With four bones: two of the cranium, frontal and ethmoid; and two of the face, superior maxillary and inferior tur- binated bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To one muscle, the tensor tarsi, and to an expansion of the tendo oculi, the former arising from the orbital sur- face, the other being attached to the lachrymal crest. Malar Bones (mala, the cheek).—The malar (fig. 28) is the strong quadrangular bone which forms the prominence of the cheek. It is divisible into an external and internal surface and four processes, the frontal, orbital, maxillary, and zygomatic. The external surface is * The lachrymal bone of the right side, viewed upon its external or orbital surface. 1. The orbital portion of the bone. 2.

The internal surface is concave, partly smooth and partly rough; smooth where it forms part of the temporal fossa, and rough where it articulates with the superior maxillary bone. frontal process ascends perpendicularly to form the outer border of the orbit, and to articulate wth the external angular process of the frontal hone. The orbital process is a thick plate, which projects inwards from the frontal process, and unites with the great ala of the sphenoid to constitute the outer wall of the orbit. It is pierced by several small foramina for the passage of temporo-malar filaments of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary process is broad, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. The zygomatic process, narrower than the rest, projects backwards to unite with the z}'goma of the temporal bone. Development.—By a single centre; in rare instances by two, or three. In many animals the malar bone is permanently divided into two por- tions, orbital and malar. Ossification commences in the malar bone soon after the vertebras. Articulations. — With bones: three of the cranium, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid; and one of the face, the superior maxillary bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To fiiK: levator labii superioris proprius, zygomaticus minor and major, masseter, and temporal. Mg. 25.* Palate Bones.—The palate bones are situated at the posterior part of the nares, where the}’’ enter into the formation of the palate, the side of the nose, and the posterior part of the floor of the orbit; hence they might, with great propriety, be named the pa- la to-naso-orbital bones. Each bone re- sembles in general form the letter L, and is divisible into a horizontal plate, a perpendicular plate, and a pterygoid process or tuberositj^ The horizontal plate is quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, one superior, which enters into the fonnation of the floor of the nares, the other inferior. * A posterior view of the right palate bone in its natural position; it is slightly turned on one side, to obtain a sight of the internal surface of the per- pendicular plate (2). 1.

The superior surface is conciive and rises towards the middle line, where it unites Avith its fellow of the opposite side and forms part of a crest (crista nasalis), which articulates with the vomer. The inferior surface is uneven, and marked bj' a slight transverse ridge, to which is attached the tendinous expansion of the tensor palati muscle. Near its e.xternal border ai’e two openings, one large and one small, the paste nor palatine foramina; the former transmits the posterior pala- tine nerve and artery, and the latter the middle palatine nerve. The posterior border is concave, and presents at its inner extremity a sharp point, which with a corresponding point in the opposite bone constitutes the palate spine for the attachment of the azygos uvulm muscle. The perpendicular plate is also quadrilateral; and presents two sur- faces, one internal or nasal, forming a part of the wall of the nares; the other external, bounding the spheno-maxillary fossa and antrum. The internal surface is marked near its middle by a horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis inferior), to Avhich is united the inferior turbinated bone; and, at about half an inch above this is another ridge (crista turbinalis superior) for the attachment of the middle turbinated bone. The concave surface below the inferior ridge is the lateral boundary of the inferior meatus of the nose ; that between the two ridges corre- sponds with the middle meatus, and the surface above the superior ridge Avith the superior meatus. The eodernal surface, extremely irre- gular, is rough on each side for articulation Avith neighbouring bones, and smooth in the middle to constitute the inner boundary of the spheno-maxillar}' fossa. This smooth surface terminates inferiorly in a deep grooA-e, Avhich being completed by the tuberosity of the supe- rior maxillarj' bone and pterj'goid process of the sphenoid, forms the posterior jxdatine canal. Near the upper part of the perpendicular plate is a large oval notch completed by the sphenoid, the splieno-palutine foramen, Avhich trans- mits the spheno-palatine nerves and artery, and serves to divide the upper extremity of the bone into tAvo portions, an anterior or orbital, and a posterior or sphenoidal portion. The orbital portion is holloAv within, and presents five surfaces externally, three articular, and tAvo free; the three articular are the anterior, which looks forAvard and ar- ticulates Avith the superior maxillary bone, the internal Avith the eth- moid, and the posterior Avith the sphenoid.

The sphenoidal portion, much smaller than the orbital, has three surfaces, two lateral and one superior. The ex- ternal lateral surface enters into the fonnation of the spheno-maxillary fos- sa ; the internal lateral forms part of the lateral boundary of the nares; and the superior surface articulates with the under part of the body of the sphe- noid bone, and assists the sphenoidal spongy bones in closing the sphenoidal sinuses. This portion takes part in the formation of the pterygo-palatine canal. The pterygoid process or tvierosity of the palate bone is the thick and rough process which stands backwards from the angle of union of the horizontal with the perpendicular por- tion of the bone. It is received into the angular fissure, which exists between the two plates of the pterygoid process at their inferior extre- mity, and presents three surfaces: one concave and smooth, which forms part of the pterygoid fossa; and one at each side to articulate with the pterygoid plates. The anterior face of this process is rough, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. Development.—By a single centre, which appears in the angle of union between the horizontal and perpendicular portion, at the same time witli ossification in the vertebrae. Articulations.—With six bones: two of the cranium, the sphenoid ^ and ethmoid; and four of the face, the superior maxillary, inferior turbinated bone, vomer, and the palate bone of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To four : the tensor palati, azygos uvulae, internal and external pterygoid. Inferior turbinated Bones.—The inferior turbinated or spongy • bone, is a thin layer of light and porous bone, attached to the crista turbinalis inferior of the inner wall of the nares, and projecting in- A wards towards the septum narium. The inferior turbinated bone is broad in front, narrow and tapering behind, and slightly curled upon itself, so as to bear some resemblance to one valve of a bivalve shell, • The perjiendicular plate of the palate bone seen upon its external or spheno- maxillary surface. 1.

The bone presents for examina- tion a convex and a concave surface, and a superior and an inferior border. The conveje surface looks inwards and upwards, and forms the inferior boundary of the middle meatus naris; it is marked by several longitudinal grooves for branches of the spheno-palatine nerve and artery. The concave surface looks downwards and outwards, and constitutes the roof of the inferior meatus. The superior border is irregular; it is attached to the crista turbinalis inferior of the superior maxillary bone in front, to the same crest on the palate bone behind, and between those attachments gives off two, and sometimes three, thin and laminated processes. The most anterior of these processes, processus iachrpmalis, articulates with the lachrymal bone, and assists in completing the nasal duct. The middle process, processus maxillaris, descends and assists in closing the antrum maxillare; while the poste- rior, processus ethmoidalis, which is often wanting, ascends towards the ethmoid bone, and also takes part in the closure of the antrum maxil- lare. The inferior border is rounded, and thicker than the rest of the bone. Development.—By a single centre, which appears at about the middle of the first year. It affords no attachment to muscles. Articulations.—With four bones: the ethmoid, superior maxillary, lachrymal, and palate. Vomer.—The vomer is a thin, quadrilateral, plate of bone, forming the posterior and inferior part of the septum of the nares. The superior border is broad and expanded, to articulate, in the : middle, with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and on each side with the processus vaginalis of the pterygoid process. The anterior part of this border is hollowed into a sheath for the reception of the rostnim of the sphenoid. The inferior border is thin and irregular, and is received into the grooved summit of the crista nasalis. The posterior border is sharp and free, and forms the posterior division of the two nares. The anterior border is more or less deeply grooved for the reception of the central lamella of the ethmoid and the cartilage of the septum. This groove is an indication of the early constitution of : the bone of two lamellse, united at the inferior border. The vomer not : unfrequently presents a convexity to one or the other side, generally, iit is said, to the left. Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance at ' the same time with those of the vertebrae. Ossification begins from B)below and proceeds upwards. At birth, the vomer presents the fonn H 'of a trough in the concavity of which the cartilage of the septum nasi Iffis placed ; it is this disposition which subsequently enables the bone H. to embrace the rostrum of the sphenoid. The vomer has no muscles attached to it. Articulations.—With s/a?bones : the sphenoid, ethmoid, two superior frmaxillary, and two palate bones, and with the cartilage of the septum.INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 50 Inferior maxillary Bone.—The lower jaw is the arch of bone which contains the inferior teeth; it is divisible into a horizontal portion or body, and a perpendicular portion, the ramus, at each side. Upon the external surface of the body of the bone, at the middle line, and extending from between the two first incisor teeth to the chin, is a slight ridge, crista mentalis, which indicates the point of conjunction of the lateral halves of the bone in the young subject, the symphysis. Immediately external to this ridge is a depression which gives origin to the depressor labii inferioris muscle; and, corresponding with the root of the lateral incisor tooth, another depression, the incisive fossa, for the levator labii inferioris. Further outwards is an oblique opening, the mental foramen, for the exit of the inferior dental nerve and artery; and below this foramen is the commencement of an oblique ridge which runs upwards and outwards to the base of the coronoid process and gives attachment to the depressor anguli oris, platysma myoides, and buccinator muscle. Near the posterior part of this surface is a rough impression made by the masseter muscle; and immediately in front of this impression, a groove may occasionally be seen for the facial artery. The projecting tuberosity at the poste- rior extremity of the lower jaw, at the point where the body and ramus meet, is the angle. Upon the internal surfaee of the body of the bone, at the sjunphysis, are two small pointed tubercles; immediately beneath these, two other tubercles, less marked and pointed; beneath them a ridge, and beneath the ridge two rough depressions of some size. These four points give attachment, from above downwards, to the genio-hyo-glossi, genio- hjmidei, part of the mylo-hyoidei, and to the digastric muscles. Running outwards into the body of the bone from the above ridge is a prominent line, the mylo-hyoidean ridge, which gives attachment to the mylo-hyoi- deus muscle, and by its extremity to the pterygo-maxillary ligament and superior constrictor muscle. Immediately above the ridge, and by the side of the symphysis, is a smooth concave surface, which cor- responds with the sublingual gland ; and below the ridge, and more externally, a deeper fossa for the submaxillary gland. The superior border of the body of the bone is the alveolar process, furnished in the adult with alveoli for sixteen teeth. The hiferior border or base is rounded and smooth; thick and everted in front to form the chin, and thin behind where it merges into the angle of the bone. The ramus is a strong square-shaped process, differing in direc- tion at various periods of life; thus, in the foetus and infant, it is almost parallel with the bod}'; in youth it is oblique, and it gradu- ally approaches the vertical direction until manhood ; in old age, after the loss of the teeth, it again declines and assumes the oblique direction. Upon its external surface it is rough, for the attachment of the masseter muscle; and at the junction of its posterior border with the body of the bone is a rough tuberosity, the angle of theINFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 51 lower jaw, which gives attachment by its inner margin to the stylo- maxillarj' ligament. The upper extremity of the ramus presents two processes, separated by a concave sweep, the sigmoid notch. The anterior is the coronoid process; it is sharp and pointed, and gives attach- ment by its inner surface to the temporal muscle. The anterior border of the coro- noid process is grooved at its lower part for the buc- cinator muscle. The poste- rior process is the condyle of the lower jaw, which is flattened from before back- wards, oblique in direction, and smooth upon its upper surface, to articulate with the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone. The con- striction around the base of the condyle is its neck, into which is inserted the external pterygoid muscle. The sigmoid notch is crossed by the masseteric artery and nerve. The internal surface of the ramus is marked near its centre by a large oblique foramen, the inferior dental, for the entrance of the inferior dental artery and nerve into the dental canal. Bounding this opening is a sharp margin, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament, and passing downwards from the opening a narrow groove which lodges the mylo-hyoidean nerve with a small artery and vein. To the uneven surface above, and in front of the inferior dental fora- men, is attached the temporal muscle, and to that below it the internal pterj-goid. The internal surface of the neck of the condyle gives at- tachment to the external pterygoid muscle; and the angle to the stylo-maxillary ligament. Development.—By two centres: one for each lateral half, the two ■ sides meeting at the symphysis, where they become united. The lower jaw is the earliest of the bones of the skeleton to exhibit ossifi- cation, with the exception of the clavicle; ossific union of the sym- physis takes place during the first year. • The lower jaw. 1.

The bones of the cranium and face are connected with each other by means of sutures {sutura, a seam), of which there are four principal vai’ieties,—r-serrated, squamous, harmonia, and schindylesis. The serrated suture is formed by the union of two borders possessing serrated edges, as in the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. In these sutures the serrations are formed almost wholly by the extemd table, the edges of the internal table lying merelj' in apposition. The squamous suture {squama, a scale) is formed by the overlapping of the bevelled edges of two contiguous bones, as in the articulation between the temporal and the lower border of the parietal. In this suture the approximated surfaces are roughened, so as to adhere me- chanically with each other. The harmonia suture {a^uv, to adapt) is the simple apposition of contiguous* surfaces, the surfaces being more or less rough and reten- tive. This suture is seen in the connection between the superior maxillary bones, or of the palate processes of the palate bones with each other.SUTURES.—OSSA TRIQUETRA. 53 The schindylesis suture {tr^iv^vXnris, a fissure) is the reception of one bone into a sheath or fissure of another, as occiu:s in the articulation of the rostrum of the sphenoid with the vomer, or of the latter with the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid, and with the crista nasalis of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The serrated suture is formed by the interlocking of the radiating fibres along the edges of the flat bones of the cranium during growth. When this process is retarded in the infant by over-distension of the head, as in hydrocephalus, and sometimes without any such apparent cause, distinct ossific centres are developed in the interval between the edges; and, being surrounded by the sutime, form independent pieces, which are called ossa triquetra, or ossa Wormiana. In the lambdoid suture there is generally one or more of these bones ; and, in a beau- tiful adult hydrocephalic skeleton in the possession of Mr. Liston, there are upwards of one hundred. The coronal suture (fig. 28) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, from the upper part of the greater wing of the sphenoid rf one side to the same point on the opposite side ; it connects the .Tontal with the parietal bones. In the formation of this suture the edges of the articulating bones are bevelled, so that the parietal rest ipon the frontal at each side, and in the middle the frontal rests upon ;he parietal bones ; they thus afford each other mutual support in the lonsolidation of the skull. The sagittal suture (fig. 28) extends longitudinally backwards along ‘.he vertex of the skull, from the middle of the coronal to the apex of ■he lambdoid suture. It is very much serrated, and serves to unite ;he two parietal bones. In the young subject, and sometimes in the idult, this suture is continued through the middle of the frontal bone o the root of the nose, under the name of the frontal suture. Ossa ■riquetra are sometimes found in the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture is named from some resemblance to the Greek etter A, consisting of two branches, which diverge at an acute angle rom the extremity of the sagittal suture. This suture connects the 'ccipital with the parietal bones. At the posterior and inferior angle >f the parietal bones, the lambdoid suture is continued onwards in a urved direction into the base of the skull, and serves to unite the ■ccipital bone with the mastoid portion of the temporal, under the iiame of additamentum suturae lambdoidalis. It is in the lambdoid • uture that ossa triquetra occur most frequently. The squamous suture (fig. 28) unites the squamous portion of the emporal bone with the greater ala of the sphenoid, and with the iiarietal, overlapping the lower border of the latter. The portion of he suture which is continued backwards from the squamous portion : f the bone to the lambdoid suture, and connects the mastoid portion vith the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, is the additamentum uturcB s([uamosce. The additamentum suturse lambdoidalis, and additamentum suturae quamosm, constitute together the mastoid suture.SUPERIOR REGION OF THE SKULL. 54 Across the upper part of the face is an irregular suture, the trans- verse, which connects the frontal bone with the nasal, superior maxil- lary, lachrymal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and malar bones. The remaining sutures are too unimportant to deserve particular names or description. Fig. 28.* REGIONS OF THE SKULL.

The LATERAL REGION of the skuU is divisible into three portions ; temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. The temporal poHion^ or temporal fossa, is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, in front by the external angular process of the frontal bone and by the malar bone, and below by the zygoma. It is formed by part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal, squamous portion of the temporal, malar bone, and zygoma, and lodges the temporal muscle with the deep temporal arteries and nerves. The mastoid portion is rough, for the attachment of muscles. Upon its posterior part is the mastoid foramen, and below, the mastoid pro- cess. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory foramen, surrounded by the external auditory process ; and in front of this foramen the glenoid cavity, bounded above by the middle root of the zygoma and in front by its tubercle. . The zygomatic portion or fossa is the irregular cavity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior maxillary bone, internally by the external pterygoid plate, above by part of the great wing of the sphenoid and squamous portion of the temporal bone, and by the temporal fossa, and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower jaw. It contains the external pterygoid, with part of the temporal and internal pterygoid muscle, and the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve, with their branches. On the inner and upper side of the zygomatic fossa are two fissures, the spheno-maxillary and the pterygo-maxillary. The splieno-maxUlary fissure is horizontal in direction, opens into the orbit, and is situated between the great ala of the sphenoid and the superior maxillary bone. It is completed externally by the malar bone. The pterygo-maxilUiry fissure is vertical, and descends at right angles from the extremity of the preceding. It is situated between the pterygoid process and the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and transmits the internal maxillary artery. At the angle of junction of these two fissures is a small space, the spheno-maadllary fossa, bounded by the sphenoid, palate, and superior maxillary bone. In this space are seen the openings of five foramina,—the foramen rotundum, spheno-palatine, pterygo-palatine, posterior palatine, and Vidian. The spheno-maxil- lary fossa lodges Meckel’s ganglion and the termination of the internal maxillary artery. The BASE GF THE SKULL presents an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar surface. The cerebral surface is divisible into three parts, which are named the anterior, middle, and posterior fossa of the base of the cranium. The anterior fossa is somewhat convex on each side, where it cor- responds with the roofs of the orbits ; and concave in the middle, in the situation of the ethmoid bone and the anterior part of the body ofBASE OF THE SKULL, 57 I the sphenoid. The latter and the lesser wings constitute its posterior I boundary. It supports the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. In the i middle line of this fossa, at its anterior part, is the C7'ista yalli; im- I mediately in front of this process, the foramen ccpxum; and on each I side the cribriform plate, with its foramina, for the transmission of the I filaments of the olfactory and nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve, i Farther back in the middle line is the processus olivaris, and on the j sides of this process the optic foramina, anterior and middle clinoid processes, and vertical grooves for the internal carotid arteries. The middle fossa of the base, deeper than the preceding, is bounded in front by the lesser wing of the sphenoid; behind, by the petrous portion of the temporal bone; and is divided into two lateral parts by the sella turcica. It is formed by the posterior part of the body, i great ala, and spinous process of the sphenoid, and by the petrous and j squamous portion of the temporal bones. In the centre of this fossa is the sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary gland, bounded in front by the anterior and middle and behind by the posterior clinoid processes. On each side of the sella turcica is the carotid groove for the internal carotid artery, the cavernous plexus of nerves, the cavernous sinus, and the orbital nerves; and a little farther outwards the following foramina, from before backwards :—sphenoidal fissure (fo- ramen lacerum anterius), for the transmission of the third, fourth, three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the sixth nerve, and ophthalmic vein ; foramen rotundmn, for the superior maxillary ner\'e; foramen ovale, for the inferior maxillary nerve, arteria menin- gea parva, and nervus petrosus superficialis minor; foramen spinosum, : for the arteria meningea media; foramen lacerum basis cranii, which . gives passage to the internal carotid artery, carotid plexus, and petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. On the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone is a groove, leading to a fissured opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve; and, immediately beneath this, a smaller foramen, for the nervus petrosus superficialis minor. Towards the apex of the petrous portion is the notch for the fifth nerve, and below it a slight depres- sion for the Gasserian ganglion. Farther outwards is the eminence which marks the position of the perpendicular semicircular canal. 1 Proceeding from the foramen spinosum, are two grooves whicli indicate the course of the trunks of the arteria meningea media. The whole • fossa lodges the middle lobes of the cerebrum. Tlie posterior fossa, larger than the other two, is fonned by the ■ occipital bone, by the petrous and mastoid portion of the temporals, rand by a sm.all part of the sphenoid and parietals. It is bounded in i front by the upper border of the petrous portion and dorsum ephippii, and along its posterior circumference by the groove for the lateral •sinuses; it gives support to the pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and ' cerebellum. In the centre of this fossa is i\ie foramen mugnum, bound- ted on each side by a rough tubercle, which gives attachment to the 'odontoid ligament, and by the anterior condyloid foramen.

Converging towards this foramen from behind is the deep groove for the lateral sinus, and from the front the groove for the inferior petrosal sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is a longitudinal ridge, which gives attachment to the falx cerebelli, and divides the two inferior fossae of the occipital hone; and above the ridge is the internal occipital pro- tuberance and the transverse groove lodging the lateral sinus. The external surface of the base of the skull is extremely irregular. From before backwards it is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate hones ; the vomer; pterygoid, spinous processes, and part of the body of the sphenoid; under surface of the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portion of the temporals; and by the occipital bone. The palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones constitute the hard palate, which is raised above the level of the rest of the base, and is surrounded by the alveolar processes containing the teeth of the upper jaw. At the anterior extremity of the hard palate, and directly behind the front incisor teeth, is the anterior palatine or incisive foramen, the termination of the anterior palatine canal, Avhich contains the naso-palatine ganglion, and trans- mits the anterior palatine nerves. At the posterior angles of the palate are the posterior palatine foramina, for the posterior palatine nerves and arteries. Passing inwards from these foramina are the transverse ridges to which are attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor pahiti muscles; and at the middle line of the posterior border, the palate spine, which gives origin to the azygos uvulae. The hard pa- late is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four pro- cesses of which it is composed. Behind, and above the hard palate, are the posterior nares, separated by the vomer, and bounded on each side by the pterj'goid processes. At the base of the pterygoid processes are the pterygo-palatine canals. The internal pterygoid plate is long and narrow, terminated at its apex by the hamular process, and at its base by the scaphoid fossa. The external plate is broad; the space between the two is the pterygoid fossa; it contains part of the internal pterj'goid muscle, and the tensor palati. Externally to the external pterj-goid plate is the zygomatic fossa. Behind the nasal fossae, in the middle line, is the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and the basilar process of the occipital bone, and, still further back, the foramen magnum. At the base of the external pterygoid plate, on each side, is the foramen ovale, and behind this the foramen spinosum with the prominent spine which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and the laxator tympani muscle. Running outwards from the apex of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, is the fissura Glased, which crosses the glenoid fossa transversely, and divides it into an anterior smooth surface, bounded by the eminentia articularis, for the condyle of the lower jaw, and a posterior rough surface for a part of the parotid gland. Behind the foramen ovale and spinosum, is the irregular fissure between the60 REGION OF THE FACE. spinous process of tlie sphenoid hone and the petrous portion of the temporal, the foramen lacerum anterius basis cranii, which lodges the internal carotid artery and Eustachian tube, and in which the carotid branch of the Vidian nerve joins the carotid plexus. Following the direction of this fissure outwards we see the foramen for the Eusta- chian tube, and that for the tensor tympani muscle, separated from each other by the processus cochleariformis. Behind the fissure is the pointed process of the petrous bone which gives origin to the levator palati muscle, and, externally to this process, the carotid foramen for the transmission of the internal carotid arterj' and the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and behind the carotid foramen, the foramen lacerum posterius and jugular fossa. Ex- ternally, and somewhat in front of the latter, is the styloid process, and at its base the vaginal process. Behind and at the root of the styloid process is the stylo-mastoid foramen, for the facial nerve and stylo- mastoid artery, and further outwards the mastoid process. Upon the inner side of the root of the mastoid process is the digastric fossa; and a little farther inwards, the occipital groove. On either side of the fo- ramen magnum, and near its anterior circumference, are the condyles of the occipital bone. In front of each condyle, and piercing its base, is the anterior condyloid foramen for the hypoglossal nerve, and di- rectly behind the condyle the irregular fossa in which the posterior condyloid foramen is situated. Behind the foramen magnum are the two curved lines of the occipital bone, the spine, and the protuberance, with rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles. The Face is somewhat oval in contour, uneven in surface, and excavated for the reception of two principal organs of sense,—the eye and the nose. It is formed by part of the frontal bone and by the bones of the face. Superiorly it is bounded bj' the frontal eminences; beneath these are the superciliary ridges, converging towards the nasal tuberosity; beneath the superciliary ridges are the supra-orbital ridges, terminating externally in the external border of the orbit, and inter- nally in the internal border, and presenting towards their inner third the supra-orbital notch, for the supra-orbital nerve and arten,'. Be- neath the supra-orbital ridges are the openings of the orbits. Between the orbits is the bridge of the nose, over-arching the anterior nares; and on each side of this opening the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, the infra-orbital foramen, and still farther outwards the pro- minence of the malar bone ; at the lower margin of the anterior nares is the nasal spine, and beneath this the superior alveolar arch, contain- ing the teeth of the upper jaw. Forming the lower boundary of the face is the lower jaw, containing in its alveolar process the lower teeth, and projecting inferiorly to form the chin; on either side of the chin is the mental foramen. If a perpendicular line be drawn from the inner third of the supra-orbital ridge to the inner third of the body of the lower jaw, it will be found to intersect three openings;— the supra-orbital, infra-orbitiil, and mental, each giving passage to a facial branch of the fifth nerve.G1 ORBITS. The orbits are two quadrilateral hollow cones, situated in the upper part of the face, and intended for the reception of the eye-balls, with t their muscles, vessels, and nerves, and the lachrymal glands. The cen- ,;tral axis of each orbit is directed outwards, so that the axis of the two, continued into the skull through the optic foramina, would intersect over the middle of the sella turcica. The superior boundary of the ■orbit is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and by part of t the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; the inferior, by p;u:t of the malar '■bone and by the orbital processes of the superior maxillary and palate bone; the internal, by the lachrymal bone, the os planum of the ! ethmoid, and part of the body of the sphenoid ; and the eocternal, by ' • the orbital process of the malar bone and the great ala of the sphenoid, i These may be expressed more clearly in a tabular form :— Frontal.

Each tooth is divisible into a crown, which is the part apparent above the gum ; a constricted portion around the base of the crown, the neck ; and a root or fang, which is contained within the alveolus. The root is invested by periosteum, which lines the alveolus, and is at the same time adherent to the root of the tooth. The incisor teeth (cutting teeth) are named from presenting a sharp and cutting edge, formed at the expense of the posterior surface. The crown is flattened from before backwards, being somewhat convex in front and concave behind ; the neck is much constricted, and the root compressed from side to side; at its apex is a small opening for the passage of the nerve and artery of the tooth. The canine teeth (cuspidati) ’follow the incisors in order from before backwards; two are situated in the upper jaw, one on each side, and two in the lower. The crown is larger than that of the incisors, con- vex before and concave behind, and tapering to a blunted point. The root is longer than that of all the other teeth, compressed at each side, and marked by a slight groove. The bicuspid teeth (bicuspidati, small molars), two on each side in each jaw, follow the canine, and are intermediate in size between them and the molars. The crown is compressed from before back- wards, and surmounted by two tubercles, one internal, the other ex- ternal ; the neck is oval ; the root compressed, marked on each side by a deep groove, and bifid near its apex. The teeth of the upper jaw have a greater tendency to the division of their roots than those of the lower, and the posterior than the anterior pair. The molar teeth (multicuspidati, grinders), three on each side in each jaw, are the largest of the permanent set. The crown is quadri- lateral, and surmounted by four tubercles, the neck large and round, and the root divided into several fangs. In the upper jaw the first and second molar teeth have three roots, sometimes four, which are more or less widely separated from each other, two of the roots being external, the other internal. In the lower there are but two roots, which are anterior and posterior ; they are flattened from behind for- wards, and grooved so as to mark a tendency to division. The third molars, or dentes sapientiae, are smaller than the other two; they pre- sent three tubercles on the surface of the crown ; and the root is single and grooved, appearing to be made up of four or five fangs compressed together, or partially divided. In the lower jaw the fangs are fre- quently separated to some distance from each other, and much cun*ed, so as to offer considerable resistance in the operation of extraction.* Structure,-—The base of the crown of each tooth is hollowed in its interior into a small cavity which is continuous with a canal passing through the middle of each fang. The cavity and canal, or canals, • See an excellent practical work, “ On the Structure, Economy, and Patho- logy of the Teeth,” by Mr. Lintott.t STRUCTURE OF TEETH. 65 constitute the cavitas pulpae, and contain a soft cellulo-vascular organ, the pidp, which receives its supply of vessels and nerves through the small opening at the apex of each root. Mr. Nasmyth, to whose inves- tigations science is so much indebted for our present knowledge of the intimate structure and development of the teeth, has observed, with regard to the pulp, that it is composed of two different tissues, vasctdar and reticidar, the former being an intricate web of minute vessels ter- minating in simple capillary loops; the latter, a network of nucleated cells in which calcareous salts are gradually deposited, and which by a systematic continuance of that process are gradually converted into ivorj'. This process naturally takes place at the surface of the pulp, and as the pulp is thus robbed of its cells, new cells are produced by the capillary plexus to supply their place, and be in their turn simi- larly transformed. A tooth is composed of three distinct structures, ivory or tooth-bone, enamel, and a cortical substance or cementum. When viewed with the microscope, the ivory appears to consist of very minute, tapering, and branching fibres, imbedded in a dense, homogeneous, interfibrous substance. The fibres commence by their larger ends at the walls of the cavitas pulpae, and pursue a radiating and serpentine course to- wards the periphery of the tooth, where they terminate in ramifica- tions of extreme minuteness. These fibres, heretofore considered as . hollow tubuli, have been shewn by Mr. Nasmyth to be rows of minute ;opake bodies, arranged in a linear series (baccated fibres, Nasmyth), to be, in fact, the nuclei of the ivory cells, the interfibrous substance being the rest of the cell filled with calcareous matter. In the natural state of the tooth all trace of the parietes or mode of connection of the cells is lost, but, after steeping in weak acid, the cellular network is «perfectly distinct. The enamel forms a crust over the whole exposed surface of the :crown of the tooth to the commencement of its root; it is thickest ever the npper part of the crown, and becomes gradually thinner as it approaches the neck. It is composed of minute hexagonal crystalline :fibres, resting by one extremity against the surface of the ivory, and I constituting by the other the free surface of the crown. The fibres, examined on the face of a longitudinal section, have a waving arrange- : nent, and consist, like those of ivory, of cells connected by their sur- faces and ends and filled avith calcareous substance. When the latter ■ 8 removed by weak acid, the enamel presents a delicate cellular net- »vork of animal matter. The cortical substance, or cementum (substantia ostoidea), forms a bin coating over the root of the tooth, from the termination of the mamel to the opening in the apex of the fang. In structure it is inalogous to bone, and is characterized by the presence of numerous -*urkinjean cells and tubuli. The cementum increases in thickness vith the advance of age, and gives rise to those exostosed appear- .nces occasionally seen in the teeth of very old persons, or in those vho have mken much mercury. In old age the cavitas pulpae is oftenDEVELOPMENT OF TEETH. 66 found filled up and obliterated by osseous substance analogous to the cementum. Mr. Nasmyth has shewn that this, like the other struc- tures composing a tooth, is formed of cells having a reticular arrange- ment. Development.—The development of the teeth in the human subject has been successfully investigated by Mr. Goodsir, to whose interesting researches I am indebted for the following narrative;—* The inquiries of Mr. Goodsir commenced as early as the sixth week after conception, in an embryo, which measured seven lines and a half in length, and weighed fifteen grains. At this early period each upper jaw presents two semicircular folds around its circumference ; the most external is the true lip ; the internal, the rudiment of the palate; and between these is a deep groove, lined by the common mucous membrane of the mouth. A little later, a ridge is developed from the floor of this groove in a direction from behind forwards ; this is the rudiment of the external alveolus; and the arrangement of the appear- ances from without inwards at this period is the following:—Most externally and forming the boundary of the mouth, is the lip; next we find a deep groove, which separates the lip from the future jaw; then comes the eoderjial alveolar ridge; fourthly, another groove, in which the germs of the teeth are developed, the primitive dental groove; fifthly, a rudiment of the internal alveolar ridge; and, sixthly, the rudiment of the future palate bounding the whole in- ternally. At the seventh week the germ of the first deciduous molar of the upper jaw has made its appearance, in the form of a “ simple, free, granular papilla” of the mucous membrane, projecting from the floor of the primitive dental groove; at the eighth week, the papilla of the canine tooth is developed; at the ninth week, the papillae of the four incisors (the middle preceding the lateral) appear ; and at the tenth week the papilla of the second molar is seen behind the anterior molar in the primitive dental groove. So that at this early period, viz. the tenth week, the papillae or germs of the whole ten deciduous teeth of the upper jaw are quite distinct. Those of the lower jaw are a little more tardy; the papilla of the first molar is merely a slight bulging at the seventh week, and the tenth papilla is not apparent until the eleventh week. From about the eighth week the primitive dental groove becomes contracted before and behind the first deciduous molar, and laminae of the mucous membrane are developed around the other papillae, which increase in growth and enclose the papillae in follicles with open mouths. At the tenth week the follicle of the first molar is com- pleted, then, that of the canine ; during the eleventh and twelfth weeks the follicles of the incisors succeed, and at the thirteenth week the follicle of the posterior deciduous molar. During the thirteenth week the papillm undergo an alteration of • “On the Origin and Development of the Pulps and Sacs of the Human Teeth,” by John Goodsir, jun., in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, January, 1839.67 DEVELOPMENT OF TEETH. I form, and assume the shape of the teeth they are intended to repre- sent. And at the same time small membranous processes are de- veloped from the mouths of the follicles ; these processes are intended to sei^ve the purpose of opercula to the follicles, and they correspond in shape ■with the form of the crowns of the appertaining teeth. To the follicles of the incisor teeth there are two opercula; to the canine, tliree; and to the molars, a number relative to the number of their tubercles, either four or five. During the fourteenth and fifteenth weeks the opercula have completely closed the follicles, so as to convert them into dtntal sacs, and at the same time the papillae have become pulps. The deep portion of the primitive dental groove, viz. that which contains the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being thus closed in, the remaining portion, that which is nearer the surface of the gum, is still left open, and to this Mr. Goodsir has given the title of secondary dental groove, as it serves for the development of all the permanent teeth, with the exception of the anterior molars. During the four- teenth and fifteenth weeks small lunated inflections of the mucous membrane are formed, immediately to the inner side of the closing opercula of the deciduous dental follicles, commencing behind the incisors and proceeding onwards through the rest ; these are the rudiments of the follicles or cavities of reserve of the four permanent incisors, two permanent canines, and the four bicuspides. As the secondary dental groove gradually closes, these follicular inflections of the mucous membrane are converted into closed cavities of reserve, which recede from the surface of the gum, and lie immediately to the inner side, and in close contact with the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being enclosed in their submucous areolar tissue. At about the fifth month the anterior of these cavities of reserve dilate at their distal extremities, and a fold or papilla projects into their fundus, constituting the rudiment of the geim of the permanent tooth ; at the same time two small opercular folds are produced at their proximal or small extremities, and convert them into true dental sacs. During the fifth month the posterior part of the primitive dental . groove behind the sac of the last deciduous tooth has remained open, and in it has developed the papilla and follicle of the first permanent molar. Upon the closure of this follicle by its opercula, the secondary dental groove upon the summit of its crown forms a large cavity of ; reserve, lying in contact with the dental sac upon the one side and with the gum upon the superficial side. At this period the deciduous ' teeth, and the sacs of the ten anterior permanent teeth, increase so ! much in size, without a corresponding lengtliening of the jaws, that Uhe first permanent molars are gradually pressed backwards and : upwards into the maxillary tuberosity in the upper jaw, and into the i'base of the coronoid process of the lower jaw ; a position wliich they 'H)ccupy at the eighth and ninth months of foetal life. In the infant of ^ven or eight months, the jaws have grown in length, and the first i permanent molar returns to its proper position in the dental range. i68 GROWTH OF TEBTH. The cavity of reserve, which has been previously elongated by the upward movement of the first permanent molar, now dilates into the cavity which that tooth has just quitted ; a papilla is developed fi’ora its fundus, the cavity becomes constricted, and the dental sac of the second molar tooth is formed, still leaving a portion of the great cavity of reserve in connection with the superficial side of the sac. As the jaws continue to grow in length, the second permanent dental sac descends from its elevated position and advances forwards into the dental range, following the same curve with the first permanent molar. The remainder of the cavity of reserve, already lengthened backwards by the previous position of the second molar, again dilates for the last time, developes a papilla and sac in the same manner with the preceding, and forms the third permanent molar or wisdom tooth, which at the age of nineteen or twenty, upon the increased growth of the jaw, follows the course of the first and second molars into the dental range. From a consideration of the foregoing phenomena, Mr. Goodsir has divided the process of dentition into three natural stages;—1. folli- cular ; 2, saccular ; 3. eruptive. The first, or follicidar stage, he makes to include all the changes which take place from the first appearance of the dental groove and papdlse to the closure of their follicles; occupying a period which extends from the sixth week to the fourth or fifth month of intra-uterine existence. The second, or saccular stage, comprises the period Avhen the follicles are shut sacs, and the included papillae pulps ; it commences at the fourth and fifth months of intra-uterine existence, and terminates, for the median incisors, at the seventh or eighth month of infantine life, and for the wisdom teeth, at about the twenty-first year. The third, or eruptive stage, includes the completion of the teeth, the eruption and shedding of the temporary set, the eruption of the permanent, and the necessary changes in the alveolar processes. It extends from the seventh month till the twenty-first year, “ The anterior permanent molar," says Mr. Goodsir, “ is the most remarkable tooth in man, as it forms a transition between the milk and the permanent set.” If considered anatomically, i. e. in its de- velopment from the primitive dental groove, by a papilla and follicle, “ it is decidedly a milk tooth if physiologically, “ as the most efficient grinder in the adult mouth, we must consider it a permanent tooth.” “ It is a curious circumstance, and one which will readily suggest itself to the surgeon, that laying out of view the wisdom teeth, which sometimes decay at an early period from other causes, the anterior molars are the permanent teeth which most frequently give way first, and in the most sjunmetrical manner, and at the same time, and frequently before the milk set.” Growth of Teeth.—Immediately that the dental follicles have been closed by their opercula, the pulps become moulded into the fonn of the future teeth ; and the bases of the molars are divided into two or three portions representing the future fangs. The dental sac is com-69 TEETH.—ER OPTION. i. posed of two layers, an internal or vascular layer, which was originally a part of the mucous surface of the mouth, and an areolo-fibrous layer, analogous to the corium of the mucous membrane. Upon the forma- tion of this sac by the closure of the follicle, the mucous membrane resembles a serous membrane in being a shut sac, and may be con- sidered as consisting of a tunica propria, which invests the pulp ; and a tunica reflexa, which is adherent by its outer surface to the struc- tiu^s composing the jaw, and by the inner surface is free, being sepa- rated from the pulp by an intervening space. As soon as the moulding of the pulp has commenced, this space increases and becomes filled with a gelatinous granular substance, the enamel organ, which is adherent to the whole internal surface of the tunica reflexa, but not to the tunica propria and prflp. At the same period, viz. during the fourth or fifth month, a thin lamina of ivory is formed in the pulp, and occupies its most prominent point: if the tooth be incisor or canine, the newly formed layer has the figure of a small hollow cone ; if molar, there will be four or five small cones corresponding with the number of tubercles on its crown. These cones are imited by the formation of additional layers, the pulp becomes gradually sur- rounded and diminishes in size, evolving fresh layers during its re- treat into the jaws, until the entire tooth with its fangs is completed, and the small cavitas pulpse of the perfect tooth alone remains, com- municating through the opening in the apex of each fang with the dental vessels and nerves. The number of roots of a tooth appears to depend on the number of nervous filaments sent to each pulp. When the formation of the ivory has commenced, the enamel organ becomes transformed into a laminated tissue, corresponding with the direction of the fibres of the enamel, and the crystalline substance of the enamel is secreted into its meshes by the vascular lining of the sac. The cementum appears to be formed at a later period of life, either by a production of osseous substance by that portion of the dental sac which continues to enclose the fang, and acts as its periosteum, or by the conversion of that membrane itself into bone; the former supposi- tion is the more probable. The formation of ivory commences in the first permanent molar pre- viously to birth. Eruption.—When the crown of the tooth has been formed and coated with enamel, and the fang has grown to the bottom of its socket by the progressive lengthening of the pulp, the formation of ivory, and the adhesion of the ivory to the contiguous portion of the sac, the pressure of the socket causes the reflected portion of the sac and the edge of the tooth to approach, and the latter to pass through the gum. The sac has thereby resumed* its original follicular condition, and has become continuous with the mucous membrane of the mouth. The opened sac now begins to shorten more rapidly than the fang lengthens, • Mr. Nasmyth is of opinion that it is “by a process of absorption, and not of disruption, that the tooth is emancipated.” Medico-Chirurgical Transac- tions, 1839.70 os HYOIDES. and the tooth is quickly drawn upwards by the contraction, leaving a space between the extremity of the unfinished root and the bottom of the socket, in which the growth and completion of the fang is more speedily effected. During the changes which have here been described as taking place among the dental sacs contained within the jaws, the septa between the sacs, which at first were composed of spongy tissue, soon became fibrous, and were afterwards formed of bone, which was developed from the surface and proceeded by degrees more deeply into the jaws, to constitute the alveoli. The sacs of the ten anterior permanent teeth, at first enclosed in the submucous areolar tissue of the deciduous dental sacs, and, received during their growth into crypts situated behind the deciduous teeth, advanced by degrees beneath the fangs of those teeth, and became separated from them by distinct osseous al- veoli. The necks of the sacs of the permanent teeth, by which they originally communicated with the mucous lining of the secondary groove, still exist, in the form of cords, separated from the deciduous teeth by their alveolus, but communicating through a minute osseous canal with the fibrous tissue of the palate, immediately behind the corresponding deciduous teeth. “ These cords and foramina are not obliterated in the child,” says Mr. Goodsir, “ either because the cords are to become useful as ‘ gubernacula' and the canals as ‘ itinera den- tium;'' or, much more probably, in virtue of a law, which appears to be a general one in the development of animal bodies, viz. that parts, or organs, which have onee acted an important part, however atrophied they may afterwards become, yet never altogether disappear, so long as they do not interfere with other parts or functions." Succession.—The periods of appearance of the teeth are extremely irregular; it is necessary, therefore, to have recourse to an average, which, for the temporarj'^ teeth, may be stated as follows, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding those of the upper by a short interval:— 7th month, two middle incisors. 18th month, canine, 9th month, two lateral incisors. 24th month, two last molares. 12th month, first molares. The periods for the permanent teeth are. 6^ year, first molares 7th year, two middle incisors. 8 th year, two lateral incisors, 9 th year, first bicuspides. 10th jmar, second bicuspides. 11th to T2th jmar, canine. 12th to 13th year, second molares. 17 th to 21 St year, last molares. os HYOIDES. The os hyoides forms the second arch developed from the cranium, and gives support to the tongue, and attachment to numerous muscles in the neck. It is named from its resemblance to the Greek letter v, and consists of a central portion or body, of two larger cornua, which71 TERNUM. project backwards from the body; and two lesser cornua, which ascend from the angles of union between the body and the greater cornua. The body is somewhat quadrila- teral, rough and convex on its ante- ro-superior surface, by which it gives attachment to muscles; con- cave and smooth on the postero-in- ferior surface, by which it lies in contact with the thyro-hyoidean membrane. The greater cornua are flattened from above downwards, and terminated posteriorly by a tubercle; and the lesser cornua, conical in form, give attachment to the stylo-hyoid ligaments. In early age and in the adult, the cor- nua are connected with the body by cartilaginous surfaces and liga- mentous fibres ; but in old age they become united by bone. Development.—By five centres, one for the body, and one for each cornu. Ossification commences in the greater cornua during the last month of foetal life, and in the lesser cornua and body soon after birth. Attachment of Muscles.—To el&oen pairs; sterno-hyoid, thjTO-hyoid, omo-hyoid, pulley of the digastricus, stylo-hyoid, raylo-hyoid, genio- hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus,hyo-glossus, lingualis, and middle constrictor of the pharynx. It also gives attachment to the stylo-hyoid, thyro- hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments,' and to the thyro-hyoidean mem- brane. THORAX AND UPPER EXTREMITY. The bones of the thorax are the sternum and ribs; and those-of the upper extremity, the clavicle, scapula, humerus, ulna and radius, bones of the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. Sternum.—The sternum (fig. 33) is situated in the middle line of the front of the chest, and is oblique in direction, the superior end lying within a few inches of the vertebral column, and the inferior being projected forwards so as to be placed at a considerable distance from the spine. The bone is flat or slightly concave in front, and marked by five transverse lines which indicate its original subdivision into six pieces. It is convex behind, broad and thick above, flattened and pointed below, and is divisible in the adult into three pieces, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior piece or manubrium is nearly quadrilateral; it is broad and thick above, where it presents a concave border (incisura semi- * The 08 hyoides seen from before. 1.

At each superior angle is a deep articidar depression (incisura clavicularis) for the clavicle, and on either side two notches, for the articulation of the cartilage of the first rib, and one half of that of the second. The middle piece or body, considerably longer than the superior, is broad in the middle, and somewhat narrower at each extremity. It presents at either side six articular notches, for the lower half of the second rib, the four next ribs, and the upper half of the seventh. This piece is sometimes perforated by an opening of various magnitude, resulting from arrest of development. The inferior piece (ensiform or xiphoid cartilage) is the smallest of the three, often merely cartilaginous, and very various in appearance, being sometimes pointed, at other times broad and thin, and at other times, again, perforated by a round hole, or bifid. It presents a notch at each side for the articulation of the lower half of the cartilage of the seventh rib. Development. — By a variable number of centres, generally ten, namely, two for the manubrium; one (sometimes two) for the first piece of the body, two for each of the remaining pieces, and one for the ensiform cartilage. Ossification commences towards the end of the fifth month in the manubrium, the two pieces for this part being placed one above the other. At about the same time the centres for the first and second pieces of the body are apparent; the centres for the third piece of the body appear a few months later, and those for the fourth piece soon after birth. The osseous centre for the ensiform cartilage is so variable in its advent, that it may be present at any period between the third and eighteenth year. The double centres for the body of the sternum are disposed side by side in pairs, and it is the irregular union of these pairs in the last three pieces of the body that gives rise to the large aperture occasionally seen in the sternum towards its lower part. Union of the pieces of the stemmn com- mences from below and proceeds upwards ; the fourth and the third unite at about puberty, the third and the second between twenty and twenty-five, and the second and the first between twenty-five and thirty. The ensiform appendix becomes joined to the body of the sternum at forty or fifty years; and the manubrium to the body only in very old age. Two small pisiform pieces have been described by Bedard and Breschet, as being situated upon and somewhat behind each extremity of the incisura semilunaris of the upper border of the manubrium. These pre-sternal or supra-stemal pieces, which are by no means constant, appear at about the thirty-fifth year. Bedard considers them to be the analogue of the fourchette of birds, and Breschet as the sternal ends of a pair of cervdcal ribs. Articulations.—With sLrteen bones; viz. with the clavicles and the seven true ribs, at each side; the latter :udiculating by means of the costal cartilages. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine pairs and one single muscle; viz. to the pectoralis major, sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, stemo-thyroid.RIBS.—TRUE AND FALSE. 73 • triangularis stemi, aponeurosis of the obliquus extemus, intemus, and • transversalis muscles, rectus, and diaphragm. Ribs.—The ribs are twelve in number at each side: the first seven . are connected with the sternum, and are thence named sternal or true : ribs ; the remaining five are the asternal or false ribs ; and the last two, shorter than the rest, and free at their extremities, are the Hooting ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the eighth, whence they again diminish to the twelfth; in breadth they diminish gradu- ally from the first to the last, and, with the exception of the last two, lare broader at the anterior than at the posterior end. The first rib is : horizontal in its direction ; all the rest are oblique, so that the ante- : rior extremity falls considerably below the posterior.

TRUE AND FALSE. and two extremities ; it is curved to correspond with the arch of the thorax, and twisted upon itself, so that, when laid on its side, one end is tilted up, while the other rests upon the surface. The external surface is convex, and marked by the attachment of muscles ; the internal is flat, and corresponds with the pleura; the superior border is rounded ; and the inferior sharp and grooved upon its inner side, for the attachment of the intercostal muscles.* Near its vertebral extremity, the rib is suddenly bent upon itself; and opposite the bend, upon the external surface, is a rough oblique ridge, which gives attachment to a tendon of the sacro-lumbalis muscle, and is called the angle. The distance between the vertebral extremity and the angle increases gradually, from the second to the eleventh rib. Beyond the angle is a rough elevation, metuhercle ; and immediately at the base and under side of the tubercle a smooth surface for articulation with the extremity of the transverse process of the corre- sponding vertebra. The vertebral end of the rib is somewhat ex- panded, and is termed the head, and that portion between the head and the tubercle is the neck. On the extremity of the head is an oval smooth surface divided by a transverse ridge into two facets for articidation with two contiguous vertebras. The posterior surface of the neck is rough, for the attachment of the middle costo-transverse ligament; and upon its upper border is a crest, which gives attach- ment to the anterior costo-transverse ligament. The sternal extre- mity is flattened, and presents an oval depression, into which the cos- tal cartilage is received. The ribs that demand especial consideration are the lirst, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. first is the shortest rib; it is broad and flat, and placed horizon- tally at the upper part of the thorax, the surfaces looking upwards and downwards, in place of forwards and backwards as in the other ribs. At about the anterior third of the upper surface of the bone, and near its internal border, is a tubercle which gives attachment to the scalenus anticus muscle, and immediately before and behind this tubercle, a shallow oblique groove, the former for the subclavian vein, and the latter for the subclavian artery. Near the posterior extremity of the bone is a thick and prominent tubercle, with a smooth articular sur- face for the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra. There is no angle. Beyond the tuberosity is a narrow constricted neck ; and at the extremity a head, presenting a single articular surface. The second rib approaches in some of its characters to the first. The tenth rib has a single articular surface on its head. The eleventh and twelftli have each a single articular surface on the head, no neck or tubercle, and are pointed at the free extremity. The eleventh has a slight ridge, representing the angle, and a shallow groove on the lower border; the twelfth has neither. * This groove is commonly described as supporting the intercostal artery, vein, and nerve; but tliis is not the case.75 COSTAL CARTILAGES. Costal Cartilages.—The costal cartilages serve to prolong the •ibs forwards to the anterior part of the chest, and contribute naainly ;o the elasticity of the thorax. They are broad at their attachment :o the ribs, and taper slightly towards the opposite extremit}*; they iliininish gradually in breadth from the first to the last; in length they 'ncrease from the first to the seventh, and then decrease to the last. The cartilages of the first two ribs are horizontal in direction, the rest ncline more and more upwards. In advanced age the costal cartilages ire converted more or less completely into bone, tliis change taking place earlier in the male than in the female. The first seven cartilages articulate with the sternum ; the three lext, with the lower border of the cartilage immediately preceding, while the last two lie free between the abdominal muscles. All the :artilages of the false ribs terminate by pointed extremities. Devekrpment.—The ribs are developed bj’^ three centres ; one for the lentral part, one for the head, and one for the tubercle. The last two have no centre for the tubercle. Ossification commences in the body somewhat before its appearance in the vertebrae; the epiphysal centres for the head and tubercle appear between sixteen and twenty, and are lonsolidated with the rest of the bone at twenty-five. Articulations.—Each rib articulates with two vertebrae and one lostal cartilage, with the exception of the first, tenth, eleventh, and ’ twelfth, which articulate each with a single vertebra only. Attachment of Muscles.—To the ribs and their cartilages are attach- id txcenty-trco pairs, and one single muscle. To the cartilages, the subclavius, stemo-thyroid, pectoralis major, internal oblique, rectus, tninsversalis, diaphragm, triangularis sterni, internal and external in- tercostals. To the ribs, the intercostal muscles, scalenus anticus, icalenus posticus, pectoralis minor, serratus magnus, obliquus externus, )bliquus internus, latissimus dorsi, quadratus lumborum, serratus posti- ;us superior, serratus posticus inferior, sacro-lumbalis, longissiraus dorsi, x;rvicalis ascendens, levatores costarum, transversalis, and diaphragm. Clavicle.—The clavicle is a long bone shaped like the italic letter and extended across the upper part of the side of the chest from the ipper piece of the sternum to the point of the shoulder, where it arti- mlates with the scapula. In position it is very slightly oblique, the iternal end being'somewhat lower and more anterior than the scapidar, ind the curves are so disposed that at the sternal end the convexity, ind at the scapular the concavity, is directed forwards. The sternal lalf of the bone is rounded or irregularly quadrilateral, and terminates n a broad articular surface. The scapular half is flattened from above lown wards, and broad at its extremity, the articular surface occupying >nly part of its extent. The upper surface is smooth and convex, and )artly subcutaneous; while the under surface is rough and depressed, or the insertion of the subclavius muscle. At the sternal extremity >f the umler surface is a very rough prominence, which gives attach- nent to the rhomboid ligament; and at the other extremity a rough76 SCAPULA. tubercle and ridge, for the coraco-cl'avicular ligament. The opening for the nutritious vessels is seen upon the under surface of the bone. Developrtmnt.—By two centres; one for the shaft and one for the sternal extremity; the former appearing] before any other hone of the skeleton, the latter between fifteen and eighteen. Articulations.—With the sternum and scapula. Attachment of Muscles.—To six: the sterno-mastoid, trapezius, pec- toralis major, deltoid, subclavius, and sterno-hyoid. Scapula.—The scapula is a flat triangular bone, situated upon the posterior aspect and side of the thorax occupjdng the space from the second to the seventh rib. It is divisible into an anterior and posterior surface ; superior, inferior, and posterior border; anterior, superior, and inferior angle ; and processes. The anterior surface, or subscapular fossa, is concave and irregular, and marked by several oblique ridges which have a direction upwards and outwards. The whole concavity is occupied by the subscapularis muscle, with the exception of a small triangular portion near the supe- rior angle. The posterior surface or dorsum is convex, and unequally divided into two portions by the spine ; that portion above the spine is the supra-spinous fossa ; and that below, the infra-spinous fossa. The superior border is the shortest of the three ; it is thin and con- cave, and terminated at one extremity by the superior angle, and at the other by the coracoid process. At its inner termination, and formed partly by the base of the coracoid process, is the supra-scapular notch, for the transmission of the supra-scapular nerve. The inferior or axillary border is thick, and marked by several grooves and depressions ; it terminates superiorly at the glenoid cavity, and inferiorly at the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough ridge, which gives origin to the long head of the triceps muscle. Upon the posterior surface of this border is a de- pression for the teres minor ; and upon its anterior surface a deeper groove for the teres major; near the inferior angle is a projecting lip, which increases the surface of origin of the latter muscle. The posterior border or base, the longest of the three, is turned to- wards the vertebral column. It is intermediate in thickness between the superior and inferior, and convex, being considerably inflected out- wards towards the superior angle. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms the head of the scapula; it is immediately surrounded by a constricted portion, the neck. The head presents a shallow pyriform articular sur- face, the glenoid cautVy, having the pointed extremity upwards; and at its apex is a Tough depression, which gives attachment to the long tendon of the biceps. The superior angle is thin and pointed. The inferior angle is thick, and smooth upon the external surface for the origin of the teres major and for a large bursa over which the upper border of the latissimus dorsi muscle plays. The spine of the scapula, triangular in form, crosses the upper part of77 SCAPULA. Fig, 34.* ' dorsum of the bone ; it commences at the posterior border by a smooth ■ triangular surface over which the trapezius glides upon a bursa, and • terminates at the point of the shoulder in the acromion process. The upper border of the spine is rough and I subcutaneous, and gives at- ! tacbment by two projecting lips to the trapezius and del- • toid muscles; the surfaces of the spine enter into the ; formation of the supra and infra-spinous fossae. The nutritious foramina of the scapula are situated in the base of the spine. The acromion is some- what triangular and flat- tened from above down- wards ; it overhangs the glenoid cavity, the upper surface being rough and subcutaneous, the lower smooth and corresponding with the shoulder-joint. Near its extremity, upon the anterior border, is an oval articular surface, for the end of the cla\'icle. The coracoid process is a thick, round, and curved process of bone, arising from the upper part of the neck of the scapula, and overarching the glenoid cavity. It is about two inches in length and very strong ; it gives attachment to several ligaments and muscles. Development. — By six centres; one for the body, one for the • coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the inferior angle, and one for the posterior border. The ossific centre for the body appears in the infra-spinous fossa at about the same time with the ossification of the vertebrae; for the coracoid process during the first year; the acro- mion process at puberty ; the inferior angle in the fifteenth year; and the posterior border at seventeen or eighteen.

Attachment of Muscles.—To siocteen: by its anterior surface to the subscapularis; posterior surface, supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus; superior border, omo-hyoid ; posterior border, levator anguli scapulm, rhoraboideus minor, rhomboideus major, and serratus magnus; anterior border, long head of the triceps, teres minor, and teres major; upper angle of the glenoid cavity, to the long tendon of the biceps; spine and acromion, to the trapezius and deltoid; coracoid process, to the pectoralis minor, short head, of the biceps, and coraco-brachialis. The ligaments attached to the coracoid process are, the coracoid, coraco-clavicular, and coraco-humeral, and the costo-coracoid mem- brane. Humerus.—The humems is a long bone, and is therefore di\dsible into a shaft and two extremities. The superior eodremity presents a rounded head; a constriction im- mediately around the base of the head, the neck; greater and a lesser tuberosity. The greater tuberosity is situated most externally^ and is separated from the lesser by a vertical furrow, the bicipital groove, which lodges the long tendon of the biceps. The edges of this groove below the head of the bone are raised and rough, and are called the antenor and posterior bicipital ridges; the former serves for the in- sertion of the pectoralis major muscle, and the latter for the insertion of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The constriction of the bone below the tuberosities is the surgical neck, and is so named, in contradistinction to the true neck, from being the seat of the accident called by surgical writers fracture of the neck of the humerxis. The shaft of the bone is prismoid at its upper part, and flattened from before backwards below. Upon its outer side, at about its middle, is a rough triangular eminence, which gives insertion to the deltoid; and immediately on each side of this eminence is a smooth depression, corresponding with the two heads of the brachialis anticus. Upon the inner side of the middle of the shaft is a ridge, for the at- tachment of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; and behind, an oblique and shallow groove, which lodges the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The foramen for the medullary’ vessels is situated upon the inner surface of the shaft of the bone a little below the coraco-brachial ridge; it is directed downwards. The loiver extremity is flattened from before backwards, and is ter- minated inferiorly by a long articular surface, divided into two parts by an elevated ridge. The external portion of the articular surface is a rounded protuberance, eminentia capitata, which articulates with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius; the internal portion is a concave and pulley'-like surface, trochlea, which articulates witli the ulna. Projecting beyond the articular surface on each side areHUMERUS. 79 . the external nncl internal condyle, the latter heing considerably the longer; and running upwards from the condyles upon the borders of the bone are the condyloid ridges, of which the external is the most ‘ prominent. Immediately in front of the trochlea is a small depression : for receiving the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the fore-ann; and immedi- FiQ- 35.* . ately behind it a large and deep fossa, for con- ■ taining the olecranon process in extension. Development. — By seven centres; one for •-the shaft, one for the head, one for the tu- berosities, one for the eminentia capitata, one for the trochlea, and one for each condyle, the internal preceding the external. Ossifica- tion commences in the diaphysis of the hu- merus soon after the clavicle ; in the head and ■ tuberosities, during the second and third years of infantile life ; in the eminentia capitata and trochlea during the third and sixth years ; • and in the condyles during the twelfth and fifteenth. The entire bone is consolidated at twenty. Articulations.—With the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and with the ulna and radius.

Ulna.—The ulna is a long bone, divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity is large, and forms principally the articulation of the elbow; while the lower extremity is small, and is excluded from the wrist-joint by an inter-articular fibro-cartilage. The superior extremity presents a semilunar concavity of large size, the greater sigmoid notch, for articulation with the humerus; and upon the outer side a lesser sigmoid notch, which articulates with the head of the radius. Bounding the greater sigmoid notch posteriorly is the olecranon process; and, overhanging it in front, a pointed eminence with a rough triangular base, the coronoid process. Behind the lesser sigmoid notch, and extending downwards on the side of the olecranon, is a triangular uneven surface, for the anconeus muscle; and upon the posterior surface of the olecranon a smooth triangular surface, which is subcutaneous. The shaft is prismoid in form, and presents three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and internal; and three borders. The anterior surface is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum for the upper three-fourths of its extent; and below by a depression, for the pronator quadratus muscle. A little above its middle is the nutritious foramen, which is directed upwards. Upon the posterior surface at the upper part of the bone is the triangular uneven depression for the anconeus muscle, bounded interiorly by an oblique ridge which runs downwards from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid notch. Below the ridge the surface is marked into several grooves, for the attachment of the extensor ossis metacarpi, extensor secundi intemodii, and extensor in- dicis muscle. The internal surface is covered in for the greater part of its extent by the flexor profundus digitorum. The anterior border is rounded, and gives origin by its lower fourth to the pronator quad- ratus ; the posterior is more prominent, and afibrds attachment to the flexor carpi ulnaris and extensor carpi ulnaris. At its upper extre- mity it expands into the triangular subcutaneous surface of the olecra- non. The eoderruxl or radial border is sharp and prominent, for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The lower extremity terminates in a small rounded head, capitidum ulncB, from the side of which projects the styloid process. The latter presents a deep notch at its base for the attachment of the apex of the triangular interarticular cartilage, and by its point gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament. Upon the posterior surface of the head is a groove, for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris; and upon the side opposite the styloid process a smooth surface, for articulation with the side of the radius. Development.—By three centres ; one for the shaft, one for the in- ferior extremity, and one for the olecranon. Ossification commences in the ulna shortly after the humerus and radius ; the two ends of the bone are cartilaginous at birth. The centre for the lower end appears at about the fifth, and that for the olecranon about the seventh year. The bone is completed at about the twentieth year. Articulations.—With two bones; the humerus and radius; it is se-RADIUS. 81 ■ parnted from the cuneiform bone of the carpus by the triangular inter- articular cartilage. Attachment of Almcles.—To twelve: by the olecranon to the triceps extensor cubiti, one head of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the an- coneus ; by the coronoid process, to the brachialis anticus, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor profundus digitorum ; by the shaft, to ^^9- 36.* tthe flexor profundus digitorum, flexor carpi ulnaris, pronator quadratus, anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor secundi intemodii pollicis, and ex- tensor indicis. Radius.—The radius is the rotatory bone of the fore-arm ; it is divisible into a shaft and two extremities : unlike the ulna, its upper extremity is small, and merely accessory to the ■ formation of the elbow-joint; while the lower e extremity is large, and forms almost solely the i joint of the wrist. The superior eoctremity presents a rounded ■head, depressed upon its upper surface into a shallow cup. Around the margin of the head itis a smooth articular surface, which is broad on V the inner side, where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna, and narrow in the rest of its circumference, to play in the orbicular ligament. Beneath the head is a >. constricted circular neck; and beneath the neck, on its internal aspect, a prominent process, the t'idxrosily. The surface of the tuberosity is sipartly smooth and partly rough ; rough below, . where it receives the attachment of the tendon )f the biceps; and smooth above, where a bursa s interposed between the tendon and the bone. The shaft of the bone is prismoid, and presents three surfaces, rhe anterior surface is somewhat concave superiorly, where it lodges •■'.he flexor longus pollicis ; and flat below, where it supports the pro- lator quadratus. At about the upper third of this surface is the nu- rritious foramen, which is directed upwards. The posterior surface is * The two bones of the fore-arm seen from the front. 1.

The external surface is rounded and convex, and marked by an oblique ridge, which extends from the tuberosity to the styloid process at the lower extremity of the bone. Upon the inner margin of the bone is a sharp and promi- nent crest, which gives attachment to the interosseous membrane. The lower eoctremity of the radius is broad and triangular, and pro- vided with two articular surfaces ; one at the side of the bone, which is concave to receive the rounded head of the ulna ; the other at the extremity, and marked by a slight ridge into two facets, one exter- nal and triangular, corresponding with the scaphoid; the other square, with the semilunar bone. Upon the outer side of the extremity is a strong conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of ^he supinator longus, and by its apex to the external lateral ligament of the wrist joint. The inner edge of the articular surface affords attachment to the base of the inter-articu- lar fibro-cartilage of the ulna. Immediately in front of the styloid process is a groove, which lodges the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, and extensor primi intemodii; and behind the process a broader groove, for the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier, and extensor secimdi intemodii; behind this is a prominent ridge, and a deep and narrow groove, for the tendon of the extensor indicis ; and still farther back part of a broad groove, completed by the ulna, for the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, and one for _ each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after the humeras, and before that in the ulna. The inferior centre appears during the second year, and the superior about the seventh. The bone is perfected at twenty. Articulations.—With four bones ; humerus, ulna, scaphoid, and semilunar. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine : by the tuberosity to the biceps ; by the oblique ridge to the supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and pronator quadratus; by the anterior surface, to the flexor longus pollicis and pronator quadratus ; by the posterior surface, to the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi intemodii; and by the styloid process, to the supinator longus. Carpus.—The bones of the carpus are eight in number ; they are arranged in two rows. In the first row, commencing from the radial side, are the os scaphoides, semilunare, cuneiforme, pisiforme ; and in the second row, in the same order, the os trapezium, trapezoides, os magnum, and uncifonne. The SCAPHOID bone is named from bearing some resemblance to the shape of a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite, concave on one side, and convex upon the other. It83 SCAPHOID BONE.—SEMILUNARE. is, however, more similar in form to a cashew nut, flattened and con- cave upon one side. If carefully examined, it will be found to present a convex and a concave surface, a convex and a concave border, a broad end, and a narroio and pointed eodremity, the tuberositj'^. To ascertain to which hand the bone belongs, let the student hold : it horizontally, so that the convex surface may look backwards (j. e. towards himself), and the convex border upwards; the broad extremity will indicate its appropriate hand ; if it be directed to the ; right, the bone belongs to the right; and if to the left, to the left carpus. Articidations.—With^^re bones; by its convex surface, with the radius ; by its concave surface, with the os magnum and semilunare; and by the extremity of its upper or dorsal border, with the trapezium and trapezoides. Attachments.—By its tuberosity to the abductor pollicis, and ante- - rior annular ligament. The SE.MiL UNAR bone may be < known by hanng a crescentic con- cavity, and a somewhat crescentic outline. It presents for examina- i tion four articular surfaces and two ; extremities; the articular surfaces ‘ are, one concave, one convex, and 1 two lateral, one lateral surface being . crescentic, the other nearly circu- .1 lar, and divided generally into two :■ facets. The extremities are, one iorsal, which is quadrilateral, flat . and indented, for the attachment of ligaments ; the other palmar, which is convex, rounded, and of •larger size. To determine to which hand it belongs, let the bone be held per- 'oendicularly, so that the dorsal or flat extremity look upwards, and ;he convex side backwards (towards the holder).

Articulations.—With_^ue bones, but occasionally with only four; by its convex surface, with the radius ; by its concave surface, with the os magnum; by its crescentic lateral facet, with the scaphoid ; and by the circular surface, with the cimeiform bone and with the point of the unciform. This surface is divided into two parts by a ridge when it articulates with the unciform as well as with the cunei- form bone. The CUNEIFORM bone, although somewhat wedge-shaped in form, may be best distinguished by a circular and isolated facet, which arti- culates with the pisiform bone. It presents for examination three sur- faces, a base, and an apex. One surface is very rough and irregular ; the opposite forms a concave articular surface; while the third is partly rough and partly smooth, and presents that circular facet which is characteristic of the bone. The base is an articular surface, and the apex is rough and pointed. To distinguish its appropriate hand, let the base be directed back- wards, and the pisiform facet upwards ; the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations With three bones, and with the triangular fibro- cartilage. By the base, with the semilunare ; by the concave surface, with the unciforme; by the circidar facet, with the pisiforme; and by the superior angle of the rough surface, with the fibro-cartilage. The PISIFORM bone maybe recognised by its small size, and by possessing a single articular facet. If it be examined carefully, it will be observed to present four sides and two extremities; one side is articular, the smooth facet approaching nearer to the superior than the inferior extremity. The side opposite to this is roimded, and the remaining sides are, one slightly concave, the other slightly convex. If the bone be held so that the articular facet shall look dowm- wards, and the extremity which overhangs the articular facet for- Avards, the concave side will point to the hand to which it belongs. Articulations.—With the cuneiform bone only. Attachments.—To two muscles, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and abductor minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament. The TRAPEZIUM (os multangulum majus) is too irregular in form to be compared to any known object; it may be distinguished by a deep groove, for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. It is some- what compressed, and may be divided into two surfaces Avhich are smooth and articular, and three rough borders. One of the articular surfaces is bval, concave in one direction, and convex in the other (saddle-seat-shaped) ; the other is marked into three facets. One of the borders presents the groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which is surmounted by a prominent tubercle for the attach- ment of the annular ligament; the otlier two borders are rough and form the outer side of the carpus. The grooved border is narrow atTRAPEZOIDES.—OS MAGNUM, 85 ' I one extremity and broad at the other, where it presents the groove . j iind tubercle. : j If the bone be held so that the grooved border look upwards while : j the apex of this border be directed forwards, and the base with the , i tubercle backwards, the concavo-convex surface wiU point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones; by the concavo-convex surface, I with the metacarpal bone of the thumb; and by the three facets of ‘ ■ the other articular surface, with the scaphoid, trapezoid, and second metacarpal bone. Attachments.—To tico muscles, abductor poUicis and flexor ossis • metacarpi; and by the tubercle, to the annular ligament. ’ The TRAPEZOIDES (os multangulum minus) is a small, oblong, and t quadrilateral bone, bent near its middle upon itself (bean-shaped). It 1' presents four articular surfaces and two extremities. One of the sur- > i : faces is cmicavo-conveoe, i. e. concave in one direction, and convex in 'I the other; another,contiguous to the preceding, is concave, so as to be K i i almost angular in the middle, and is often marked by a small rough ’ depression, for an interosseous ligament; the two remaining sides are flat, and present nothing remarkable. One of the two extremities is ’ broad and of large size, the dorsal; the other, or palmar, \a small and i : rough. I If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the broad extremity be .« ■ upwards, and the concavo-convex surface forwards, the angular concave t ; surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Artkulaiions.—With bones; by the concavo-convex surface, ! • with the second metacarpal bone; by the angular concave surface, i: with the os magnum ; and by the other two surfaces, with the trape- •; i zium and scaphoid. Attachments.—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. IThe os MAGNUM (capitatum) is the largest bone of the carpus, and is divisible into a body and head. The head is round for the greater part of its extent, but is flattened on one side. lAiohody is irregularly quadrilateral, and presents four sides and a smooth extremity. Two of the sides are rough, the one being square and flat, the dorsal, the other rounded and prominent, the palmar; the other two sides are articular, the one being concave, the other convex. The extremity is .a triangular articular surface, divided into three facets. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the articular extremity ; look upwards, and the broad dorsal surface backwards (towards the i holder), the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which ! the bone belongs. Articulations.—With seven bones; by the rounded head, with the t cup formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bone; by the side of the convex surface, with the trapezoides ; by the concave surface, with the unciforme ; and by the extremity, with the second, third, and fourth : metacarpal bones. Attachments.—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. i86 UNCIFORME. Fig. 38.t The UNCIFORME is a triangular-shaped hone, remarkahle for a long and curved process, which projects from its palmar aspect. It pre- sents five surfaces;—three articular, and two free. One of the arti- cular surfaces is divided by a slight ridge into two facets; the other two converge, and meet at a flattened angle.* One of the free sur- faces, the dorsal, is rough and triangular; the other, palmar, also tri- angular, but somewhat smaller, gives origin to the unciform process. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the articular surface with two facets look upwards, and the unciform process backwards (towards the holder), the concavity of the unciform process will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Arliculations.—With_^i>e bones : by the two facets on its base, with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones; by the two lateral articu- lating surfaces, with the magnum and cuneiforme; and by the flat- tened angle of its apex, with the semilunare. Attachments.—To two muscles, adductor minimi digiti, and flexor brevis minimi digiti; and by the hook-shaped process to the annular ligament. Development.—The bones of the carpus are each developed bj' a single centre; they are cartilagi- nous at birth. Ossification com- mences towards the end of the first year in the os magnum and unci- forme; at the end of the third year, in the cuneiforme; during the fifth j^ai', in the trapezium and se- milunare; during the eighth, in the scaphoides; the ninth, in the trapezoides; and the twelfth, in the pisiforme. The latter bone is the last in the skeleton to ossify; it is, in reality, a sesamoid bone of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. * When the uncifonne does not articulate with the semilunare, this angle is sharp. t The hand viewed upon its anterior or palmar aspect. 1.

I K f t I i I I Metacarpus.—The bones of the metacarpus are five in number. They are long bones, divisible into a head, shaft, and base. The head is rounded at the extremity, and flattened at each side, •for the insertion of strong ligaments ; the s/«<y^ifis prismoid,and marked -deeply on each side, for the attachment of the interossei muscles; and ’.the base is irregularly quadrilateral, and rough for the insertion of •-tendons and ligaments. The base presents three articular surfaces; one at each side, for the adjoining metacarpal bones; and one at the extremity, for the carpus. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is one-third shorter than the rest, rflattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and convex on its palmar side; : the articular surface of the head is not so round as that of the other rmetacarpal bones; and the base has a single concavo-convex surface, : to articulate with the similar surface of the trapezium. The metacarpal bones of the different fingers may be distinguished i by certain obvious characters. The base of the metacarpal bone of : the index finger is the largest of the four, and presents four articular > surfaces. That of the middle finger may be distinguished by a r rounded projecting process upon the radial side of its base, and two s small circular facets upon its ulnar lateral surface. The base of the I. metacarpal bone of the ring-finger is small and square, and has two ' small circular facets to correspond with those of the middle meta- I carpal. The metacarpal bone of the little finger has only one lateral i articular surface. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the ; thumb, the epiphysis of which, like that of the phalanges, occupies the carpal end of the bone. Ossification of .the metacarpal bones com- I mences in the embryo between the tenth and twelfth week, that is, > soon after the bones of the fore-arm. The epiphyses make their ap- ppearance at the end of the second, or early in the third year, and the i bones are completed at twenty. Articvlations.—The first with the trapezium ; second, Avith the tra- fpezium, trapezoides, and os magnum, and with the middle metacarpal tbone; third, or middle, with the os magnum, and adjoining metacarpal 1 bones; fourth, with the os magnum and unciforme, and with the ad- ; joining metacarpal bones; and, fifth, with the unciforme, and with the I metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. The figures resulting from the number of articulations Avhich each I metacarpal bone possesses, taken from the radial to the ulnar side, are 13,121.

Phalanges.—The phalanges are the bones of the fingers; the}’-are named from their arrangement in rows, and are fourteen in number, three to each finger, and two to the thumb. In conformation they are long bones, divisible into a shaft, and two extremities. The shaft is compressed from before backwards, convex on its posterior surface, and flat with raised edges in fi’ont. The metacarpal extremity, or base, in the first row, is a simple concave articular surface, that in the other two rows a double concavity, separated by a slight ridge. The digital extremities of the first and second row present a pulley-like surface, concave in the middle, and convex on each side. The ungual extremity of the last phalanx is broad, rough, and ex- panded into a semilunar crest. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences first in the third phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the second. The period of commencement corre- sponds with that of the metacarpal bones. The epiphyses of the first row appear during the third or fourth year, those of the second row during the fourth or fifth, and of the last during the sixth or seventh. The phalanges are perfected by the twentieth year. Articulations.—The first row, with the metacarpal bones and second row of phalanges; the second row, with the first and third; and the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To the base of the first phalanx of the thumb four muscles, abductor pollicis, flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pollicis, and extensor primi internodii; and to the second phalanx, tico, the flexor longus pollicis, and extensor secundi internodii. To the first phalanx, of the second, third, and fourth fingers, one dorsal and one palmar interosseous; and to the first phalanx of the little finger, the abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and one palmar interosseous. To the second phalanges, the flexor sublimis and exten- sor communis digitorum; and to the last phalanges, the flexor profun- dus and extensor communis digitorum. PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY. The bones of the pelvis are the two ossa innominata, the sacrum, and the coccyx; and of the lower extremity, the femur, patella, tibia and fibula, tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges.89 OS INNOMINATUM. ILIUM. ) Os INXOMINATUM.—The OS innominatura (os coxie) is an irregular, ) ■ flat bone, consisting in the young subject of three parts, which meet at * • the acetabiJuin. Hence it is usually described in the adult as divi- ^ ■ sible into three portions, ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the Fig. 39.* ■ superior, broad, and expanded portion which forms the prominence of !the hip, and articulates with the sacrum. The ischium is the inferior r and strong part of the bone on which we sit. The os pubis is that [•portion which forms the front of the pelvis, and gives support to the t external organs of generation. The ILIUM may be described as divisible into an internal and ex- I'temal surface, a crest, and an anterior and posterior border. The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, below by a pprominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by * The 08 innorainatum of the right side. 1.

The posterior third is rough, for articulation with the sacrum, and is divided by a deep groove into two parts ; an anterior or auricular portion^ which is shaped like the pinna, and coated by cartilage in the fresh bone ; and a posterior portion, which is very rough and uneven, for the attachment of interosseous ligaments. The eodernal surface is uneven, partly convex, and partly concave : it is bounded above by the crest; below by a prominent arch, which forms the upper segment of the acetabulum; and before and behind by the anterior and posterior borders. Crossing this surface in an arched direction, from the anterior extremity of the crest, to a notch upon the lower part of the posterior border, is a groove, which lodges the gluteal vessels and nerve, the superior curved line ; and below this, at a short distance, a rough ridge, the inferior curved line. The surface in- cluded between the superior curved line and the crest gives origin to the gluteus medius muscle; that between the curved lines, to the glu- teus minimus ; and the rough interval between the inferior curved bne and the arch of the acetabulum, to one head of the rectus. The posterior sixth of this surface is rough and raised, and gives origin to part of the gluteus maximus. The crest of the ilium is arched and curved in its direction like the italic letter /, being bent inwards at its anterior termination, and out- wards towards the posterior. It is broad for the attachment of three planes of muscles, which are connected with its external and internal borders or lips, and with the intermediate space. The anterior border is marked by two projections, the anterior su- perior spinous process, which is the anterior termination of the crest, and the anterior inferior spinous process; the two processes being se- parated by a notch for the attachment of the sartorius muscle. This border terminates inferiorly in the lip of the acetabulmn. The poste- rior border also presents two projections, the posterior superior and the posterior inferior spinous process, separated by a notch. Inferiorly this border is broad and arched, and forms the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch. The ISCHIUM is divisible into a thick and solid portion, the body, and into a thin and ascending part, the ranvis ; it may be considered also, for convenience of description, as presenting an external and in- ternal surface, and three borders, posterior, inferior, and superior. The external surface is rough and uneven, for the attachment of muscles; and broad and smooth above, where it enters into the forma- tion of the acetabulum. Below the inferior lip of the acetabulum is a notch, which lodges the obturator extemus muscle in its passage outwards to the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The internal surface is smooth, and somewhat encroached upon at its posterior border by the spine. The posterior border of the ischium presents towards its middle a remarkable projection, the S2rine. Immediately above the spine is a91 OS PUBIS. :notch of large size, the great sacro-ischiatic, and below the spine, the tlesser sacro-ischiatic notch ; the foimer, being converted into a foramen ■ by the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, gives passage to the pyriformis rmuscle, the gluteal vessels and nerve, pudic vessels and nerve, and ischiatic vessels and nerves ; and the lesser, completed by the great > sacro-ischiatic ligament, to the obturator internus muscle, and to the ; internal pudic vessels and nerve. The mferior border is thick and h broad, and is called the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is divided into three facets ; one anterior, which is rough for the origin ■ of the semi-membranosus ; and two posterior, which are smooth, and .'Separated by a slight ridge for the semi-tendinosus and biceps muscle. iThe inner margin of the tuberosit}' is bounded by a sharp ridge, ■ which gives attachment to a prolongation of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, and the outer margin by a prominent ridge, from which the quadi'atus femoris muscle arises. The superior border of the ischium i is thin, and forms the lower circumference of the obturator foramen. "The ramus of the ischimn is continuous with the ramus of the pubes, sand is slightly everted. The os PUBIS is divided into a horizontal portion or body (hori- :zontal ramus of Albinus), and a descending portion or ramus ; it pre- ssents for examination an external and internal surface, a superior and iinferior border, and symphysis. The external surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles ; and f prominent at its outer extremity, where it forms part of the acetabu- ! lum. The internal surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the cavnty of the pelvis. The superior border is marked by a r rough ridge, the crest; the inner termination of the crest is the angle ; ? and the outer end, the spim or tubercle. Running outwards from the ^ spine is a sharp ridge, the pectineal line, or linea ilio-pectinea, which I marks the brim of the true pelvis. In front of the pectineal line is a • smooth depression, which supports the femoral artery and vein, and a little more externally an elevated prominence, the ilio-pectineal ■eminence, which divides the surface for the femoral vessels from an- ' other depression which overhangs the acetabulum, and lodges the ; psoas and iliacus muscles. The ilio-pectineal eminence, moreover, imarks the junction of the pubes with the ilium. The inferior border : is broad, and deeply grooved, for the passage of the obturator vessels : and nerve, and sharp upon the side of the ramus, to form part of the I boundary of the obturator foramen. The symphysis is the inner ex- ttremity of the body of the bone ; it is oval and rough, for the attach- iment of a ligamentous structure analogous to the intervertebral sub- ^stance. The ramus of the pubes descends obliquely outwards, and is ccontinuous with the ramus of the ischium. The inner border of the r ramus forms with the corresponding bone the arch of the pubes, and -at its inferior part is considerably everted, to afford attachment to the tcrus penis. The acetabulum (cavitas cotyloidea) is a deep cup-shaped cavity, »situated at the point of union between the ilium, ischium, and pubes ;92 ACETABULUM.—OBTURATOR FORAMEN. a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a little more than two-fifths by the ischium, and the remaining fifth by the pubes. It is bounded by a deep rim or lip, which is broad and strong above, where most resistance is required, and marked in front by a deep notch, which is arched over in the fresh subject by a strong ligament, and transmits the nutrient vessels into the joint. At the bottom of the cup, and communicating with the notch, is a deep and circular pit (fundus acetabuli), which lodges a mass of fat, and gives attachment to the broad extremity of the ligamentum teres. The obturator or thyroid foramen is a large oval interval between the ischium and pubes, bounded by a narrow rough margin, to which a ligamentous membrane is attached. The upper part of the foramen is increased in depth by the groove in the under surface of the os pubis, which lodges the obturator vessels and nerve. Development.—By eight centres: three principal, one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the pubes ; and five secondary, one, the Y shaped piece for the interval between the primitive pieces in the acetabulum, one for the crest of the ilium, one (not constant) for the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ilium, one for the tuberosity of the ischium, and one (not constant) for the angle of the os pubis. Ossification commences in the primitive pieces, im- mediately after that in the vertebrae, firstly in the ilium, then in the ischium, and lastly in the pubes ; the first ossific deposits being situated near the future acetabiilum. At birth, the acetabulum, the crest of the ilium, and the ramus of the pubes and ischium, are carti- laginous. The secondary centres appear at puberty, and the entire bone is not completed until the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With three bonesj sacrum, opposite innominatum, and femur. Attachment of Muscles and Ligaments.—To thirty-five muscles: to the ilium thirteen ; by the outer lip of the crest, to the obhquus ex- ternus for two-thirds, and to the latissimus dorsi for one-third its length, and to the tensor vaginae femoris by its anterior fomrth; by the middle of the crest, to the internal oblique for three-fourths its length, by the remaining fourth to the erector spin® ; by the internal lip, to the transversalis for three-fourths, and to the quadratus lumborum by the posterior part of its middle third. By the external surface, to the gluteus medius, minimus, and maximus, and to one head of the rectus; by the internal surface to the iliacus ; and by the anterior border to the sartorius, and the other head of the rectus.

The true pelvis is all that portion which is situated be- neath the linea ilio-pectinea. This line forms the margin or brim of the true pelvis, while the included area is called the inlet. The form of the inlet is heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front at the symphysis pubis, expanded on each side, and encroached upon behind by a pro- jection of the upper part of the sacrum, which is named the pro- montory. The cavity is somewhat encroached upon at each side by a smooth quadrangidar plane of bone, corresponding with the internal surface of the acetabulum, and leading to the spine of the ischium. In front are two fossae around the obturator foramina, for lodging the ob- turator internus muscle, at each side. The inferior termination of the pelvis is very irregular, and is termed the outlet. It is bounded, in front, by the convergence of the rami of the ischium and pubes, which constitute the arch of the pubes ; on each side by the tuberosity of the ischium, and by two irregular fissures formed by the greater and lesser sacro-ischiatic notches: and behind by the lateral borders of the sa- crum, and by the coccyx. The pelvis is placed obliquely -with regard to the trunk of the body, so that the inner surface of the ossa pubis is directed upwards, and would support the superincumbent weight of the viscera. The base of the sacrum rises nearly four inches above the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx somewhat more than half an inch above its lower border. If a line Avere carried through the central axis of the inlet, it would impinge by one extre- mity against the umbilicus, and by the other against the middle of the coccyx. The axis of the inlet is, therefore, directed downwards and backwards, while that of the outlet points downwards and forwards, and corresponds with a line drawn from the upper part of the sacrum, through the centre of the outlet. The axis of the cavity represents a curve, which corresponds very nearly with the curve of the sacrum, the extremities being indicated by the central points of the inlet and outlet. A knowledge of the direction of these axes is most important to the surgeon, as indicating the line in Avhich instruments should be used in operations upon the viscera of the pelvis, and the direction of force in the removal of calcub from the bladder; and to the accoucheur, as explaining the course token by the foetus during parturition. There are certain striking differences between the male and female pelvis. In the male the bones are thicker, stronger, and more solid, and the cavity deeper and narrower. In the female the bones are lighter and more delicate, the iliac fossae are large, and the ilia ex- panded ; the inlet, the outlet, and the cavity are large, and the acetabula farther removed from each other; the cavity is shallow, the tuberosities ividely separated, the obturator foramina triangular, and the span of the pubic arch greater. The precise diameter of the inlet and outlet, and the depth of the cavity, are important considerations to the accouchcui’. The diameters of the inlet or brim are three: 1. Antero-posterior,95 PELVIS. FEMUR. sacro-pubic or conjugate; 2. transverse; and 3. oblique. The an- tero-posterior extends from the symph3^sis pubis to the middle of the promontor}’- of the sacrum, and measures four inches. The transverse extends from the middle of the brim on one side to the same point on the opposite, and measures five inches. The ohliqiui extends from the sacro-iliac sj’mphysis on one side, to the margin of the brim corre- sponding with the acetabulum on the opposite, and also measmes five inches. The diameters of the outlet are two, antero-posterior and transverse. The antero-posterior diameter extends from the lower part of the sym- ph3'sis pubis to the apex of the coccyx ; and the transverse, from the posterior part of one tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side ; the3' both measure four inches. The cavity of the pelvis measures in depth four inches and a half, posteriorly; three inches and a half in the middle; and one and a half at the s3'^mphysis pubis. Femur.—The femur, the longest bone of the skeleton, is situated obliquely in the upper part of the lower limb, articulating by means of its head with the acetabulum, and inclining inwards as it descends, until it almost meets its fellow of the opposite side at the knee. In the female this obliquity is greater than in the male, in consequence of the greater breadth of the pelvis. The femur is divisible into a shaft, a superior, and an inferior extremity. At the superior extremity is a rounded head, directed upwards and inwards, and marked just below its centre by an oval depression for the ligamentum teres. The head is supported by a nech, which varies in length and obliquity according to sex and at various periods of life, being long and oblique in the adult male, shorter and more horizontal in the female and in old age. Externally to the neck is a large pro- cess, the trochanter major, which presents upon its anterior surface an oval facet, for the attachment of the tendon of the gluteus minimus muscle; and above, a double facet, for the insertion of the gluteus medius. On its posterior side is a vertical ridge, the Unea quadrati, for the attachment of the quadratus femoris muscle. Upon the inner side of the trochanter major is a deep pit, the trochanteric or digital fossa, in which are inserted the tendons of the pyriformis, gemellus superior and inferior, and obturator extemus and internus muscles. Passing downwards from the trochanter major in front of the bone is an oblique ridge, which forms the inferior boundary of the neck, the anterior intertrochanteric line; and behind, another oblique ridge, the posterior intertrochanteric line, which terminates in a rounded tu- bercle upon the posterior and inner side of the bone, the trochanter minor. The shaft of the femur is convex and rounded in front, and covered with muscles; and somewhat concave and raised into a rough and pro- minent ridge behind, the Unea aspera. The linea aspera near the upper extremity of tlie bone divides into three branches. The anterior branch is continued forwards in front of the lesser trochanter, and isFEMUR. 96 Fig. 41 * u continuous with the anterior intertrochanteric line ; the middle is con- tainued directly upwards into the- linea quadrat!; and the posterior, broad and strongly marked, ascends to the base of the trochanter major. Towards the lower extremity of the bone the linea aspera divides into two ridges, which descend to the two condyles, and enclose a triangular space upon which rests the popliteal artery. The internal condyloid ridge is less marked than the external, and presents a broad and shallow groove, for the passage of the femoral artery. The nutritious foramen is situated in or near the linea aspera, at about one-third from its upper extremity, and is directed obliquely from below upwards. The lower extremity of the femur is broad and porous, and divided by a smooth depres- sion in front, and by a large fossa (fossa inter- condyloidea) behind, into two condyles. The external condyle is the broadest and most prominent, and the internal the narrow- est and longest; the difference in length de- pending upon the obliquity of the femur, in consequence of the separation of the two bones at their upper extremities by the breadth of the pelvis. The external condyle is marked upon its outer side by a prominent tuberosity, which gives attachment to the external lateral ligament ; and immediately beneath this is the fossa which lodges the tendon of origin of the popliteus. By the internal surface it gives attachment to the anterior crucial ligament of the knee-joint; and by its upper and posterior part, to the external head of the gastrocnemius and to the plantaris. The internal condyle pro- jects upon its inner side into a tuberosity, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament; above this tuberosity, at the extremity of the internal cond3'loid ridge, is a tubercle, for the insertion of the tendon of the adductor magnus; and beneath the tubercle, upon the upper surface of the condj'-le, a depression, from which the internal head of the gastrocnemius arises.

Development.—'Qyjive centres; one for Fig.i2.* the shaft, one for each extremity, and one for each trochanter. The femur is the first of the long bones to shew signs of ossifica- tion. In it, ossific matter is found imme- diately after the maxillae and before the ter- mination of the second month of embryonic life. The secondary deposits take place in the following order,—in the condyloid ex- tremity during the last month of foetal life t; in the head towards the end of the first year; in the greater trochanter between the third and the fourth year; in the lesser trochanter between the thirteenth and fourteenth. The epiphyses and apophyses are joined to the diaphysis in the reverse order of their appearance, the junction commencing after puberty and not being completed for the condyloid epiphysis until after the twentieth year. Articulations.— With three bones ; with the os innominatum, tibia, and patella. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-three; by the greater trochanter, to the gluteus me- dius and minimus, pyriformis, gemellus su- perior, obturator intemus, gemellus inferior, obturator extemus, and quadratus femoris; by the lesser trochanter, to the common ten- don of the psoas and iliacus. By the linea aspera, its outer lip, to the vastus extemus, gluteus maximus, and short head of the bi- ceps; by its inner lip, to the vastus inter- nus, pectineus, adductor brevis, and adduc- tor longus; by its middle to the adductor magnus; by the anterior part of the bone, to the cruREus and subcruraeus; by its con- dyles, to the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteus. • A diagram of tho posterior aspect of the right femur, shewing the lines of attachment of the muscles.

Fig 43 * Patella.—The patella is a sesamoid bone, developed in the ten- don of the quadriceps extensor muscle, and usually described as a bone of the lower extremity. It is heart-shaped in figure, the broad end being directed upwards and the apex downwards, the external surface convex, and the internal divided b}’ a ridge into two smooth surfaces, to articulate with the condyles of the femur. The external articular surface, corresponding with the external condyle, is the larger of the two, and serves to indicate the leg to which the bone belongs. Development. — By a single centre, at about the middle of the third year. Articulations.—With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles. — To four; the rectus, cruraeus, vastus intemus and vastus externus ; and to the ligamentum patellae. ' Tibia.— The tibia is the inner and larger bone of the leg; it is prismoid in form, and divisible into a shaft, an upper and a lower extremity. The upper extremity., or head, is large, and expanded on each side into two tube- rosities. Upon their upper surface the tu- berosities are smooth, to articulate with the condyles of the femur; the internal arti- cular surface being oval and oblong, to cor- respond with the internal condyle; and the external, broad and nearly circuhir. Be- tween the two articular surfaces is a spinous process; and in front and behind the spi- nous process a rough depression, giving attachment to the anterior and posterior crucial ligaments. Between the two tube- rosities on the front aspect of the bone is a prominent elevation, the tubercle, for the insertion of the ligamentum patellae, and immediately above the tubercle a smooth facet, corresponding with a bursa. Upon the outer side of the external tuberosity is an articular surface, for the * The tibia and fibula of the right leg, articulated and seen from the front. 1. The shaft of the tibia. 2.

The shaft of the tibia presents three surfaces; internal, which is subcutaneous and superficial; external, which is concave and marked by a sharp ridge, for the insertion of the interosseous membrane; and posterior, grooved, for the attachment of muscles. Near the upper extremity of the posterior surface is an oblique ridge, ihepopliteal line, for the attachment of the fascia of the popliteus muscle; and imme- diately below the oblique line, the nutritious canal, which is directed downwards. The inferior extremity of the bone is somewhat quadrilateral, and is prolonged on its inner side into a large process, the internal malleolus. Behind the internal malleolus,is a broad and shallow groove, for lodging the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum; and farther outwards another groove, for the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis. Upon the outer side the surface is concave and triangular, rough above, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament; and smooth below, to articulate with the fibula. Upon the extremity of the bone is a triangular smooth surface, for articulating with the astragalus. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the tibia, immediately after the femur; the centre for the head of the bone appears soon after birth, and that for the lower extremity during the second year; the latter is the first to join the diaphysis. The bone is not complete until near the twenty-fifth year. Two occasional centres have some- times been found in the tibia, one in the tubercle, the other in the in- ternal malleolus. Articulations.—With three bones; femur, fibula, and astragalus. Attachment of Museles.—To ten; by the internal tuberosity, to the sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus; by the ex- ternal tuberosity, to the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum; by the tubercle, to the ligamentum patellae ; by the external surface of the shaft, to the tibialis anticus; and by the posterior surface, to the popliteus, soleus, flexor longus digitorum, and tibialis posticus. Fibula.—The fibula a brooch, from its resemblance, in conjunction with the tibia, to the pin of an ancient brooch) is the outer and smaller bone of the leg; it is long and slender in figure, prismoid in shape, and, like other long bones, is divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The superior extremity or head is thick and large, and depressed upon the upper paid by a concave surface, which articulates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Externally to this surface is a thick and rough prominence, for the attachment of the external lateral liga- ment of the knee-joint, terminated behind by a styloid process, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps.100 FIBULA. The Imver extremity is flattened from without inwards, and pro- longed downwards beyond the articular surface of the tibia, forming the external malleolus. Its external side presents a rough and tri- angular surface, which is subcutaneous. Upon the internal surface is a smooth triangular facet, to articulate with the astragalus; and a rough depression, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament. The anterior border is thin and sharp; and the posterior^ broad and grooved, for the tendons of the peronei muscles. To place the bone in its proper position, and ascertain to which leg it belongs, let the inferior or flattened extremity be di- rected downwards, and the narrow border of the malleolus forwards; the triangular subcutaneous surface will then point to the side corresponding with the limb of which the bone should form a part. The shaft of the fibula is prismoid, and presents three surfaces; external, in- ternal, and posterior; and three borders. The external surface is the broadest of the three; it commences upon the anterior part of the bone above, and curves around it so as to terminate upon its posterior side below. This surface is completely occu- pied by the two peronei muscles. The internal surface commences on the side of the superior articular surface, and termi- nates below, by narrowing to a ridge, which is continuous with the anterior bor- der of the malleolus. It is marked along its middle by the ititerosseous ridge, which is lost above and below in the inner bor- der of the bone. The posterior surface is twisted like the external, it commences above on the posterior side of the bone, and terminates below on its internal side ; at about the middle of this surface is the nutritious foramen, Avhich is directed down- wards. The internal border commences superior- ly in common with the interosseous ridge, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lines, * The tibia and fibula of the right leg articulated and seen from behind. 1.

The external border begins at the base of the styloid process upon the head of the fibula, and winds around the bone, following the direction of the corresponding surface. The posterior border is sharp and prominent, and is lost interiorly in the interosseous ridge. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after its appearance in the tibia; at birth the extremities are cartilaginous, an ossific deposit taking place in the inferior epiphysis during the second year, and in the superior during the foiuth or fifth. The inferior epiphysis is the first to become united with the diaphysis, but the bone is not completed until nearly the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With the tibia and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.—To m'we ; by the head, to the tendon of the biceps and soleus ; by the shaft, its external surface, to the per- oneus longus and brevis ; internal surface, to the extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, peroneus tertius, and tibialis posticus ; by the posterior surface, to the popliteus and flexor longus pollicis. Tarsus.—The bones of the tarsus are seven in number: viz. the astragalus, calcaneus, scaphoid, internal, middle, and external cunei- form, and cuboid. The Astragalus (os tali) may be recognised by its rounded head, a broad articular facet upon its convex surface, and two articular facets, separated by a deep groove, upon its concave surface. The bone is divisible into a superior and inferior surface, an external and internal border, and an anterior and posterior extremity. The su- perior surface is convex, and presents a large quadrilateral and smooth facet somewhat broader in front than behind, to articulate with the tibia. The inferior surface is concave, and di^dded by a deep and rough groove (sulcus tali), which lodges a strong interosseous ligament, into two facets, the posterior large and quadrangular, and the aJiterior smaller and elliptic, which articulate with the os calcis. The internal border is flat and irregular, and marked by a pyriform articular sur- face, for the inner malleolus. The eocternal presents a large triangular articular facet, for the external malleolus, and is rough and concave in front. The anterior extremity presents a rounded head, surrounded bj' The surface of the shaft upon which the flexor longus digitorum muscle rests. 8.

Articulations.—With four bones; tibia, fibula, calcaneus, and sca- phoid. Fig. 45* The Calcaneus (os calcis) may be known by its large size and oblong figure, by the large and irregular portion which forms the heel, and by two articular surfaces, separated by a broad groove, upon its upper side. The calcaneus is divisible into four surfaces, superior, inferior, ex- ternal, and internal; and two ex- tremities, anterior and posterior. The superior surface is convex be- hind and irregularly concave in front, where it presents two and some- times three articular facets, divided by a broad and shallow groove (sul- cus calcanei), for the interosseous li- gament. The inferior surface is con- vex and rough, and bounded poste- riorly by the two inferior tuberosi- ties, of which the internal is broad and large, and the external smaller and prominent. The external sur- face is convex and subcutaneous, and marked towards its anterior third by two grooves, often sepa- rated by a tubercle, for the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. The internal surface is concave and grooved, for the tendons and vessels which pass into the sole of the foot.

Upon the anterior extremity of the bone is a flat articular surface, surmounted by a rough projection, which affords one of the guides to the surgeon in the perfonnance of Chopart’s operation. The posterior extremity is prominent and convex, and constitutes the posterior U(he- rosity ; it is smooth for the upper half of its extent, where it corre- sponds with a bursa ; and rough below, for the insertion of the tendo Achillis ; the lower part of this surface is bounded by the two inferior tuberosities. Articulations.—With tivo bones : the astragalus and cuboid. In their articulated state a large oblique canal is situated between the astragalus and calcaneus, being formed by the apposition of the two grooves, sulcus tali and sulcus calcanei. This groove is called the sinus tar^, and serves to lodge a strong interosseous ligament which binds the two bones together. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine: by the posterior tuberosity, to the tendo Achillis and plantaris ; by the inferior tuberosities and under surface, to the abductor poUicis, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis digitorum and flexor accessorius, and to the plantar fascia ; and by the external surface to the extensor brevis digitorum. The Scaphoid bone may be distinguished by its boat-like figure, concave on one side, and convex with three facets upon the other. It presents for examination an anterior and a posterior surface, a supe- rior and an inferior border, and two extremities, one broad, the other pointed and thick. The anterior surface is convex, and divided into three facets, to articulate with the three cuneiform bones ; the poste- rior is concave, to articulate with the rounded head of the astragalus. The superior border is convex and rough, and the inferior somewhat concave and irregular. The external extremity is broad and rough, and the internal pointed and prominent, so as to fonn a tuberosity. The external extremity sometimes presents a facet of articulation with the cuboid. If the bone be held so that the convex surface with three facets look forwards, and the convex border upwards, the broad extremity will point to the side corresponding Avith the foot to which the bone belongs. Artiadations.—With four bones : astragalus and three cuneiform bones, sometimes also with the cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.—To the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The Internal Cuneiform may be known by its irregular wedge- shape, and by being larger than the two other bones bearing the same name. It presents for examination a convex and a concave sur- face, a long and a short articular border, and a small and a large extremity.104 CUNEIFORM BONES. Place the bone so that the small extremity may look upwards and the long articular border forwards, the concave surface will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which it belongs. The convex su7face is internal and free, and assists in forming the inner border of the foot; the concave is external, and in apposition with the middle cuneiform and second metatarsal bone; the loTig hordei' articulates with the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and the slm't border with the scaphoid bone. The small extremity (edge) is sharp, and the larger extremity (base) rounded into a broad tube- rosity. Articidations.—With four bones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, and first two metatarsal bones. Attachment of Miiscles.—To the tibialis anticus and posticus. The Middle Cuneiform is the smallest of the three; it is wedge- shaped, the broad extremity being placed upwards, and the sharp end downwards in the foot. It presents for examination four articular surfaces and two extremities. The anterior and posterior surfaces have nothing worthy of remark. One of the lateral surfaces has a long articular facet, extending its whole length, for the internal cunei- form ; the other has only a partial articular facet for the external cmieiform bone. If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, the broadest edge of the square being towards the holder, the small and partial articular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articidations.—With four bones: scaphoid, internal and external cuneiform, and second metatarsal bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To the flexor brevis polbcis. The External Cuneiform is intermediate in size between the two preceding, and placed, like the middle, with the broad end up- wards, and the sharp extremity downwards. It presents for examina- tion five surfaces, and a superior and inferior extremity. The upper extremity is flat, of an oblong square form, and bevelled posteriorly, at the expense of the outer surface, into a sharp edge. If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, and the sharp border backwards, the bevelled surface will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With six bones : scaphoid, middle cuneiform, cuboid, and second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. . A ttachment of Muscles.—To the flexor brevis pollicis. The Cuboid bone is irregularly cuboid in form, and marked upon its under surface by a deep groove, for the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. It presents for examination, six surfaces, three articular, and three non-articular. The non-articidar surfaces are the superior, which is slightly convex, and assists in forming the dorsum of theMETATARSAL BONES. 105 foot; the inferior, marked by a prominent ridge, the tuberosity, and a deep groove for tlie tendon of the peroneus longus ; and an exterrnal, the smallest of the whole, and deeply notched by the commencement of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are, the posterior, which' is of large size, and concavo-convex, to articulate with the os calcis ; anterior, of smaller size, divided l)y a slight ridge into two facets, for the fourth and fifth metatarsal hones ; and internal, a small oval arti- cular facet, upon a large and quadrangular surface, for the external cuneiform hone. If the bone be held so that the plantar surface, with the peroneal groove, look downwards, and the largest articular surface backwards, the small non-articular surface, marked by the deep notch, will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. A rticulations.—Withfour bones; calcaneus, external cuneiform, and fourth and fifth metatarsal bones, sometimes also with the scaphoid. Attachment of Aluscles.—To three; the flexor brevis poUicis, adduc- tor pollicis, and flexor brevis minimi digiti. Upon a consideration of the articulations of the tarsus it will be ob- served, that each bone articulates with four adjoining bones, with the exception of the calcaneus which articulates with two, and the exter- nal cuneiform with six. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, with the exception of the os calcis, which has an epiphysis for its posterior tuberosity. The centres appear in the following order ; calcanean, sixth month; astragalan, seventh month ; cuboid, tenth month; external cuneiform, during the first year ; internal cuneiform, during the third year ; middle cuneiform and scaphoid, during the fourth year. The epiphysis of the calcaneus appears at the ninth jmar and is united with the dia- physis at about the fifteenth. The Metatarsal bones,in number, are long bones, and divi- sible therefore into a shaft and two extremities. Tlie shaft is pris- moid, and compressed from side to side ; the posterior extremity, or base, is square-shaped, to articulate with the tarsal bones, and with each other; and the anterior extremity presents a rounded head, cir- cumscribed by a neck, to articulate with the first row of phalanges. Peculiar Metatarsal bones.—Tloc first is shorter and larger than the rest, and forms part of the inner border of the foot; its posterior ex- tremity presents only one lateral articular surface, and an oval rough prominence beneath, for the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. The anterior extremity has, upon its plantar surface, two grooved facets, for sesamoid bones. The second is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones; it presents at its base three articular facets, for the three cunei- form bones; a large oval facet, but often no articular surface, on its inner side, to articulate with the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and two externally, for the third metatarsjil bone. The third may be known by two facets upon the inner side of its106 METATARSAL BONES. base, corresponding with the second, and may be distinguished by its smaller size. The fourth may be distinguished by its smaller size, and by having a single articular surface on each side of the base. The fifth is recognised bj' its broad base, and bj' its large tubero- sity, in place of an articular sur- face, on its outer side. Development.—Each bone by two centres; one for the bodj'and one for the digital extremity in the four outer metatarsal bones; and one for the body, the other for the base in the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Ossific deposition appears in these bones at the same time with the vertebrae; the epiphyses, commen- cing with the great toe and proceed- ing to the fifth, appear towards the close of the second year, consolida- tion being effected at eighteen. Articulations.—With the tarsal bones by one extremity, and with the first row of phalanges by the other. The number of tarsal bones with which each metatarsal articu- lates from within outwards, is the same as between the bones of' the metacarpus and carpus,—one for the first, three for the second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth, forming the cipher 13T21. Attachment of Muscles.—Ho fourteen; to the first, the peroneus longus and first dorsal interosseous muscle ; to the second, two dorsal interossei and transversus pedis ; to the third, two dorsal and one plantar interosseous, aiductor pollicis and transversus pedis; to the * The sole of the left foot. 1.

Phalanges.—There are two phalanges in the great toe, and three in the other toes, as in the hand. They are long bones, divisible into a central portion and extremities. The phalanges of the first row are convex above, concave upon the under surface, and compressed from side to side. The posterior ex- tremity has a single concave articular surface, for the head of the metatarsal bone ; and the anterior extremity, a pulley-like surface, for the second phalanx. The second phalanges are short and diminutive, but somewhat broader than those of the first row. The third, or ungual phalanges, including the second phalanx of the great toe, are flattened Irom above downwards, spread out laterally at the base, to articulate with the second row, and at the opposite ex- tremity, to support the nail and the rounded extremity of the toe. Development-—By two centres ; one for the body and one for the metacarpal extremity. Ossification commences in these bones after that in the metatarsus, appearing firstly in the last phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the middle row. The bones are completed at eighteen. Articulations.—The first row with the metatarsal bones and second phalanges ; the second, of the great toe with the first phalanx, and of the other toes with the first and third phalanges ; and the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-three; to the first phalanges; great toe, the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, ab- ductor pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis pollicis, and transversus pedis ; second toe, first dorsal and first plantar interosseous and lum- bricalis ; third toe, second dorsal and second plantar interosseous and lumbricalis; fourth toe, third dorsal and third plantar interosseous and lumbricalis; fifth toe, fourth dorsal interosseous, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti and lumbricalis. Second phalanges; great toe, extensor longus pollicis, and flexor longus pollicis; other toes, one slip of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and flexor brevis digitorum. Third phalanges ; two slips of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and the flexor longus digitorum. Sesamoid Bones.—These are small osseous masses, developed in those tendons which exert a certain degree of force upon the surface over which they glide, or where, by continued pressure and friction, the tendon would become a source of irritation to neighbouring parts, as to joints. The best example of a sesamoid bone is the patella, de- veloped in the common tendon of the quadriceps extensor, and resting108 SESAMOID BONES. upon the front of the knee-joint. Besides the patella, there are four pairs of sesamoid hones included in the number of pieces which com- pose the skeleton, two upon the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of each thumb, and existing in the tendons of insertion of the flexor brevis poUicis, and two upon the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons of the muscles inserted into the base of the first phalanx. In addition to these there is often a sesamoid bone upon the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint of the little finger ; and upon the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons inserted into the base of the first phalanx ; there is one also in the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, Avhere it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone ; some- times in the tendons, as they wind around the inner and outer malleolus ; in the psoas and iliacus, where they glide over the body of the os pubis ; and in the external head of the gastrocnemius. The bones of the tympanum,, as they belong to the apparatus of hear- ing, will be described with the anatomy of the ear.109 CHAPTER II. ON THE LIGAMENTS. The bones are variously connected with each other in the construc- tion of the skeleton, and the connection between any two bones con- stitutes a joint or articulation. If the joint be immovable, the sur- faces of the bones are applied in direct contact; but if motion be in- tended, the opposing surfaces are expanded and coated by an elastic substance named cartilage ; a fluid secreted by a membrane closed on all sides lubricates their surface, and they are firmly held together by means of short bands of glistening fibres, which are called ligaments (ligare, to bind). The study of the ligaments is termed syndesmology (<ruv, together, bond), which, with the anatomy of the articula- tions, forms the subject of the present chapter. The forms of articulation met with in the human frame may be considered under three classes:—Synarthrosis, Amphi-arthrosis, and Diarthrosis. Synarthrosis (<ruv, articulation) is expressive of the fixed form of joint in which the bones are immovably connected with each other. The kinds of synarthrosis are four in number. 1. Sutura. 2. Harmonia, 3. Schindylesis. 4. GompJiosis. The characters of the three first have been sufficiently explained in the preceding chap- ter, p. 52. It is here only necessary to state that, in the construction of sutures, the substance of the bones is not in immediate contact, but is separated by a layer of membrane, which is continuous exter- nally with the pericranium and internally with the dura mater. It is the latter connection which gives rise to the great difficulty sometimes experienced in tearing the calvarium from the dura mater. Cruveil- hier describes this interposed membrane as the sutural cartilage ; I never saw any structure in the sutures which could be regarded as cartilage, and the history of the formation of the cranial bones would suggest a different explanation. The fourth, Gomphosis ('yog.<pas, a nail), is expressive of the insertion of one bone into another, in the same manner that a nail is fixed into a board; this is illus- trated in the articulation of the teeth with the alveoli of the maxillary bones. Amphi-arthrosis (ccfi(pi, both, is a joint intermediate in aptitude for motion between the immovable synarthrosis and the movable diarthrosis. It is constituted by the approximation of sur- faces partly coated with cartilage lined by synovial membrane, and110 ARTICULATIONS. partly connected by interosseous ligaments, or by the intervention of an elastic fibro-cartilage which adheres to the ends of both bones. Examples of this mode of articulation are seen in the union between the bodies of the vertebra;, of the sacrum with the coccyx, of the pieces of the sternum, the sacro-iliac and pubic symphyses (a-lv (fuuv, to grow together), and, according to some, of the necks of the ribs, with the transverse processes. Diarthrosis (S/a, through, is the movable articulation, which constitutes by far the greater number of the joints of the body. Tbe degree of motion in this class has given rise to a subdivision into three genera. Arthrodia, Ginglymus, and Enarthrosis. Arthrodia is the movable joint in which the extent of motion is slight and. limited, as in the articulations of the clavicle, of the ribs,' articular processes of the vertebrae, axis with the atlas, radius with the ulna, fibula with the tibia, carpal and metacarpal, tarsal and meta- tarsal bones. Ginglymus {ytyyXvfio;, a hinge), or hinge-joint, is the movement of bones upon each other in two directions onlj^ viz. forwards and backwards; but the degree of motion may be very considerable. The instances of this form of joint are numerous; thej^ comprehend the elbow, wrist, metacarpo-phalangeal and phalangeal joints in the upper extremity ; and the knee, ankle, metatarso-phdangeal and phalangeal joints in the lower extremity. The lower jaw may also be admitted into this category, as partaking more of the character of the hinge- joint than of the less movable arthrodia. The form of the ginglymoid joint is somewhat quadrilateral, and each of its four sides is provided with a ligament, which is named from its position, anterior, posieiior, internal, or external lateral.. The lateral ligaments are thick and strong, and are the chief bond of union between the bones. The anterior and posterior are thin and loose in order to permit the required extent of movement. Enarthrosis (Iv, in, is the most extensive in its range of motion of all the movable joints. From the manner of connection and form of the bones in this articulation, it is called the ball and socket joint. There are two instances in the body, viz. the hip and the shoulder. I have been in the habit of adding to the preceding the carpo-meta- carpal articulation of the thumb, although not strictly a ball-and- socket joint, from the great extent of motion which it enjoys, and from the nature of the ligament connecting the bones. As far as the articular surfaces are concerned, it is rather a double than a single ball-and-socket; and the whole of these considerations remove it from the simple arthrodial and gingl5Tnoid groups. The ball-and-socket joint has a circular form ; and, in place of the four distinct, ligaments of the ginglymus, is enclosed in a bag of liga- mentous membrane, called a capsjdar ligament. The kinds of articulation may probably be conveyed in a more sa- tisfactory manner in the tabular form, thus :Ill MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS. Examples.

The motions permitted in joints may be referred to four heads, viz. 1. Gliding. 2. Angular movement. 3. Circumduction. 4. Rotation. 1. Gliding is the simple movement of one articular surface upon another, and exists to a greater or less extent in all the joints. In the least movable joints, as in the cai'pus and tarsus, this is the only mo- tion which is permitted. 2. Angular movement may be performed in four different directions, either forwards and’backwards, as in flexion and extension; or inwards and outwards, constituting adduction and abduction. Flexion and ex- tension are illustrated in the ginglymoid joint^ and exist in a large proportion of the joints of the body. Adduction and abduction con- joined ■with flexion and extension, are met with complete, only in the most movable joints, as in the shoulder, the hip, and the thumb. In the wrist and in the ankle adduction and abduction are only partial. 3. Circumduction is most strikingly exhibited in the shoulder and hip joints; it consists in the slight degree of motion which takes place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, while the extremity of the limb is made to describe a large circle upon a plane surface. It is also seen, but in a less degree, in the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb, metacarpo-phalangeal articulations of the fingers and toes, and in the elbow when that joint is flexed and the end of the humerus fixed. 4. Rotation is the movement of a bone upon its own axis, and is illustrated in the hip and shoulder, or better, in the rotation of the cup of the radius against the eminentia capitata of the humerus. Rota- tion is also observed in the movements of' the atlas upon the axis, in which the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns. The structures entering into the composition of a joint are bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, and synovial membrane. Car- tilage forms a thin coating to the articular extremities of bones, some- times presenting a smooth surface which moves on a corresponding smooth surface of the articulating bone; sometimes fonning a plate smooth on both surfaces and interposed between the cartilaginous ends of two bones, interuiiiculur; and sometimes acting as the connecting medium between bones without any free surface, interosseous. Fibrous tissue enters into the construction of joints under the form of ligament, in one situation constituting bands of various breadth and thickness.112 STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE. in another a layer which extends completely round the joint, and is then called a capsular ligament. All the ligaments of joints are com- posed of that variety of fibrous tissue termed white fibrous tissue, but in some situations ligaments are found which consist of yellow fibrous tissue, for example, the ligamenta subflava of the arches of the verte- bral column. Adipose tissue exists in variable quantity in relation with joints, where it performs, among other offices, that of a valve or spring, which occupies any vacant space that may be formed during the movements of the joint, and effectually prevents the occurrence of a vacuum in those cavities. This purpose of adipose tissue is exem- plified in the cushion of fat at the bottom of the acetabulum and in the similar cushion behind the ligamentum patellae. Synovial mem- brane constitutes the beautiful smooth and polished lining of a joint, and contains the fluid termed synovia by means of which the adapted surfaces are enabled to move upon each other with perfect ease and freedom. Cartilage.—In the structure of joints, cartilage serves the double purpose of a connecting and separating medium. In the former capa- city possessing great strength ; and in the latter, smoothness and elas- ticity. In reference to its intimate structure it admits of classification into three kinds, true cartilage; reticular cartilage, and fibrous car- tilage. True Cartilage is composed of a semi-transparent homogeneous sub- stance (hyaline or vitreous substance) containing a number of minute cells (cartilage corpuscles) dispersed at short intervals through its structure. The cells are oval, oblong, or polyhedral in shape, and more or less flattened ; their membranous envelope is blended with the intercellular substance, and they contain in their interior secondary cells, nuclei, nucleoli, oil globules, and more or less of granular matter. * A portion of articular (true) cartilage from the head of the fibula. The section is made vertically to the surface, and magnified 155 times. It exhibits the appearance and arrangement of the cells near to the bone. The irregular line to the left is the boundary of the bone.STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE. 113 Cartilage cells have an average measurement of ™ their long di.ometer ; they are sometimes isolated, sometimes grouped Fig. 48.* Fig 49.1' in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. They are larger near the bone than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender in form, and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish and opaline in colour, and its intercellular substance is semitransparent and structureless. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify. In the latter case the intercellular substance be- comes fibrous and more or less opaque, its colour is yellowish, and the cells are found to contain a greater number of oil- globules than in its natural state. The true cartilages are, the articular, costal, ensiform, thyroid, cricoid, ary- tenoid, tracheal and bronchial, nasal, meatus auris, the pulley of the troch- learis muscle, and temporary cartilage, or the cartilage of bone previously to ossification.§ Reticular cartilage is composed of cells in dia- • Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage.

The cells are parent cells, containing others of secondary formation, together with nuclei, nucleoli, granular matter, and oil-globules in greater number than those of true cartilage. The fibres are short, imperfect, loose in texture, and yellowish. The instances of reticular cartilage are, the pinna, epiglottis, and Eustachian tube. Fibrous cartilage is composed of a network of white, glistening fibres collected into fasciculi of various size, and containing in its Fig. 51.* meshes cells and a subfibrous tissue resembling that of reticular cartilage. The fibres of fibrous cartilage are identical with those of fibrous tissue, the cells are large (about y^^th of an inch), as in reti- cular cartilage, and the areolae are variable in dimensions. It is this latter character that constitutes the difference between different fibrous cartilages; some being composed almost entirely of fibres with few and small interstices, as the interarticular cartilages ; while others exhibit large spaces filled with an imperfect fibrous tissue and cells, as the in- tervertebral substance. The fibrous cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups,— namely, interarticular, stratiform, interosseous, and free. The in- stances of interarticular fibrous cartilage (menisci) are those of the lower jaw, sternal and acromial end of the clavicle, wrist, carpus, knee, to which may be added the fibrous cartilages of circumference, glenoid, and cotyloid. The stratiform fibrous cartilages are such as form a thin coating to the grooves on bone through which tendons play. The interosseous fibrous cartilages are the intervertebral sub- stance and symphysis pubis. T!\\e free fibrous cartilages are the tarsal cartilages of the eyelids. * A portion of fibrous cartilage. The section is taken from the symphysis pubis, and magnified 155 times.FIBROUS TISSUE. 115 The development of cartilage is the same with that of cartilage of bone (p. 5), the diiferent forms of cai'tilage resulting from subsequent changes in the intercellular substance and cells. Thus, for example, in articular cartilage the cells undergo the lowest degree of development, are very disproportionate to the intercellular substance, and the latter remains penmmently structureless. In reticular cartilage the cells possess a more active growth, and suiqiass in bulk the intercellular substance, while the latter is composed also of cells, which assume a fibrous dis- position. In fibrous cartilage, development is most energetic in the intercellular substance; this is converted into fasciculi of fibrous tissue, while the interspaces are filled with cells and imperfect fibrous tissue in every stage of development. Fibrous Tissue is one of the most generally distributed of all the animal tissues ; it is composed of fibres of extreme minuteness, and presents itself under three elementary forms; namely, white fibrous tissue, yeUow fibrous tissue, and red fibrous tissue. In ichite fibrous tissue, the fibres are cylindrical, exceedingly minute (about of an inch in diameter), transparent and undulating ; they are collected into small fasciculi (from to -^p^pp of an inch), and these latter form larger fasciculi, which, according to their arrangement, give rise to the production of thin laminse, membranes, ligamentous bands, and tendinous cords. The connecting medium of the fibres in the formation of the primitive fasciculi is a transparent, structureless, interfibrous substance or blastema, to which in most situations are added numerous minute dark filaments derived from nuclei, and thence termed nuclear filaments. The nuclear filaments are sometimes wound spirally round the fasciculi, or interlace with their separate fibres; at other times they are variously twisted, and run parallel with the fasciculi. The fasciculi are connected and held to- gether in the formation of membranes and cords by loose fibres which are interwoven between them, or by mutual interlacement. Examples of white fibrous tissue are met with in three principal forms ; namely, membrane, ligament, and tendon. The membranous form of white fibrous tissue is seen in the common connecting medium of the body, namely, fibro-cellular or areolar tissue, in which the membrane is extremely thin, and disposed in laminae, bands, or threads, leaving interstices of various size between them. It is seen also in the condensed covering of various organs, as the periosteum, perichondrium, capsulae propriae of glands, membranes of the brain, sclerotic coat of the eyeball, pericardium, fasciae; sheaths of muscles, tendons, vessels, nerves, and ducts; sheaths of the erectile organs, and the corium of the dermal and mucous membrane. lAyament is the name given to those bands of various breadth and thickness which retain the articular ends of bones in contact in the construction of joints. They are glistening and inelastic, and com- posed of fasciculi of fibrous tissue ranged in a parallel direction side by side, or in some situations interwoven with each other. The fasciculi are held together by separate fibres, or by areolar tissue.116 ADIPOSE TISSUE. Tendon is the collection of parallel fasciculi of fibrous tissue, by means of which muscles are attached to hones. They are constructed on the same principle as ligaments, are usually rounded in their figure, but in some instances are spread out so as to assume a membranous form. In the latter state they are called aponeuroses. Yellow fibrous tissue is known also by the appellation elastic tissue, from one of its more prominent physical properties, a property which permits of its fibres being drawn out to double their length and again returning to their original dimensions. The fibres of elastic tissue are transparent, brittle, flat, or polyhedral in shape, colourless when single, but yellowish in an aggregated form, and considerably thicker (37^ of an inch in diameter) than the fibres of white fibrous tissue. In the construction of their peculiar tissue they communicate with each other by means of short oblique fibres, which unite ^vith adjoining fibres at acute or obtuse angles without any enlargement of the fibre with which they are joined. This circumstance has given rise to the idea of the fibres giving off branches, an expression derived from the division of blood-vessels, and another term borrowed from the same source has been applied to their communication with each other, namely inoscu- lation ; but both these expressions in their literal meaning are incor- rect. When yellow fibrous tissue is cut or tom, the fibres, in conse- quence of their elasticity, become clubbed and curved at the extremity, a striking character of this tissue. The instances of yellow fibrous tissue are ; the ligamenta subflava of the arches of the vertebrae, chordae vocales, thyro-epiglottic liga- ment, crico-thyroidean membrane, the membranous layers connecting the cartilaginous rings of the trachea and bronchial tubes, the capsula propria of the spleen, and the middle coat of arteries. It is also met with around some parts of the alimentary canal, as the oesophagus, cardia, and anus, around the male and female urethra, in the fascia lata, and in the corium of the skin. Red fibrous tissue is also termed contractile tissue, from a peculiar property which it possesses, and which places it physiologically in an intermediate position between white fibrous tissue and muscular fibre. Its fibres are cylindrical, transparent, reddish in hue, and collected into fascicidi. It is met with in the corium of the skin, in the dartos, around the nipple, in the excretory ducts of glands, in the coats of blood-vessels, particularly veins, in the iris, in the intervascular spaces of the erectile tissue of the penis and clitoris, around the urethra, and around the vagina. Adipose Tissue is composed of minute cells, aggregated together in clusters of various size within the areolae of fibro-cellular tissue. The cells of adipose tissue are identical in manner of fomiation with other cells, being developed around nuclei, and increasing in size by the form- ation of fluid in their interior. In adipose cells, this fluid, instead of being albuminous as in other cells, is oleaginous, the oil at first appear- ing in separate globules, which subsequently coalesce into a single drop. The size of adipose cells at their full development is aboutLIGAiMENTS OF THE TRUNK. 117 of an inch in diameter ; when isolated they are globular in form, but are hexagonal or polyhedral when compressed. They are per- fectly transparent, the cell-membrane being structureless and their nucleus disappearing as they attain their full size. Synovial Membrane is a thin membranous layer, which invests the articular cartilages of the bones, and is thence reflected upon the surfaces of the ligaments which surround and enter into the composi- tion of a joint. It resembles the serous membranes in being a shut sac, and secretes a transparent and viscous fluid, which is named sjmovia. Synovia is an alkaline secretion, containing albumen, which is coagulable at a boiling temperature. The continuation of this mem- brane over the surface of the articular cartilage, a much agitated question, has been decided by the interesting discoveries of Henle, who has ascertained the existence of an epithelium upon cartilage identical ^vith that produced by the reflected portion of the membrane. In some of the joints the synovial membrane is pressed into the articular cavity by a cushion of fat: this mass was called by Havers the synovial gland, from an incorrect supposition that it was the source of the synovia ; it is found in the hip and in the knee-joint. In the knee-joint, moreover, the synovial membrane forms folds, which are most improperly named ligaments, as the mucous and alar liga- ments, the two latter being an appendage to the cushion of fat. Besides the synovial membranes entering into the composition of joints, there are numerous smaller sacs of a similar kind interposed between surfaces which move upon each other so as to cause friction; they are often associated with the articulations. These are the bursce mttcoscB; they are shut sacs, analogous in structure to synovial mem- branes, and secreting a similar s}Tiovial fluid. The epithelium of synovial membranes is of the kind termed tesselated; it is developed in the same manner with the epithelium of other free surfaces, and is continually reproduced from beneath, while the superficial layers are being rubbed off and lost. articulations. The joints may be arranged, according to a natural division, into— those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. Ligaments of the Trunk.—The articulations of the trunk are divisible into ten groups, viz.— 1. Of the vertebral column. 2. Of the atlas, with the occipital bone. 3. Of the axis, with the occipital bone. 4. Of the atlas, with the axis. 5. Of the lower jaw.LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 118 6. Of the ribs, with the vertebrse. 7.

Articulation of ilie vertebral Column.—The ligaments connecting together the different pieces of the vertebral column, admit of the same arrangement as that of the vertebrae themselves. Thus the ligaments Of the bodies, are the— Of the arches,— Of the articular processes,— Of the spinous processes,— Anterior common ligament, Posterior common ligament, Intervertebral substance. Ligamenta subflava. Capsular ligaments. Synovial membranes. Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous. Inter-transverse. Of the transverse processes,— Bodies.—The Anterior common ligament is a broad and riband- like band of ligamentous fibres, extending along the front surface of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the intervertebral substance, and less closely with the bodies of the vertebrae. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lumbar, and consists of a median and two lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of Fig. 62.♦ * The anterior ligafnonts of the vertebrse, and ligaments of the ribs. 1.

The interarticular ligament con- necting the head of the rib to the intervertebral substance, and separating the two synovial membranes of this articulation.Fig. 53.* 119 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. vessels. The ligament is composed of fibres of vaiious length closely interwoven with each other ; the deeper and shorter crossing the inter- vertebral substance from one vertebra to the next; and the superficial and longer fibres crossing three or four vertebrae. The anterior common ligament is in relation by its posterior or ver- tebral surface, with the intervertebral substance, the bodies of the vertebrae, and with the vessels, principally veins, which separate its central from its lateral portions. By its anterior or visceral surface it is in relation in the neck, with the longus colli muscles, the pharjmx and the oesopha- gus ; in the thoracic region, with the aorta, the venae azygos, and thoracic duct; and in the lumbar region, with the aorta, right renal artery, right lumbar arteries, arteria sacra media, vena cava inferior, left lumbar veins, receptaculum chyli, the commence- ment of the thoracic duct, and the tendons of the lesser muscle of the diaphragm with the fibres of which the ligamentous fibres interlace. The Posterior common ligament lies upon the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, and extends from the axis to the sacrum. It is broad opposite the inter- vertebral substance, to which it is closely adherent; and narrow and thick over the bodies of the vertebrae, from which it is separated by the veins of the base of each vertebra. It is composed like the ante- rior ligament of shorter and longer fibres which are disposed in a similar manner. The posterior common ligament is in relation by its anterior surface with the interv'ertebral substance, the bodies of the vertebrae, and with the venae basium vertebrarum ; and by its posterior surface with the dura mater of the spinal cord, some loose areolar tissue and nume- rous small veins being interposed. The Intervertebral stthstance is a lenticular disc of fibrous cartilage, interposed between each of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum, and retaining them firmly in connexion with each other. It differs in thickness in different parts of the column, and varies in depth at different points of its extent; thus, it is thickest in the lumbar re- gion, deepest in front in the cervical and lumbar regions, and behind * A posterior view of the bodies of three dorsal vertebras, connected by their intervertebrai substance 1, 1.

When the intervertebral substance is bisected either horizontally or vertically, it is seen to be composed of a series of layers of dense fibrous tissue, separated by interstices filled with the softer kind. The central part of each intervertebral disc is wholly made up of this softer fibrous cartilage, which has the appearance of a pulp, #,nd is so elastic as to rise above the level of the section as soon as its division is completed. When examined from the front, the layers are found each other at the middle line by a slight interspace. They coun- teract, by their elasticity, the efforts of the flexor muscles of the trunk; and by preserving the upright position of the spine, limit the expenditure of muscular force. They are longer in the cervical than in the other regions of the spine, and are thickest in the lumbar region. The ligamenta subflava are in relation by both surfaces with the meningo-rachidian veins, and internally they are separated from the dura mater of the spinal cord by those veins and some loose areolar and adipose tissue. Articular processes.—The ligaments of the articidar processes of the vertebrae are loose sjTiovial capsules which surround the articu- lating surfaces. They are protected on their external side by a thin layer of ligamentous fibres. Spinous processes. — The inter-spinous ligaments are thin and membranous, and are extended between the spinous processes in the dorsal and lumbar regions. They are thickest in the latter region; and are in relation with the multifidus spin® muscle at each side. * An internal view of the arches of three vertebra.

Arches. — The ligamenta subflava are two thin planes, of yellow fibrous tissue, situa- ted between the arches of each pair of vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum. From the im- bricated position of the laminae they are attached to the poste- rior surface of the vertebra be- low, and to the anterior sur- face of the arch of the vertebra above, and are separated fr'om121 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The SuprorspiTious ligament (fig. 62) is a strong and inelastic fibrous cord, which extends from the apex of the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum, being attached to each spinous process in its course ; it is thickest in the lumbar region. The continuation of this ligament upwards to the tuberosity of the occipital bone, con- xiSUf'S- stitutes the rudimentary ligamentum nuchse of man. The latter is strengthened, as in animals, by a thin slip from the spinous process of each of the cervical vertebrae. Transverse processes.—The inter-transverse ligaments are thin and membranous ; they are found only between the transverse pro- cesses of the lower dorsal vertebrae. 2. Articulation of the AUas with the Occipital bone.—The ligaments of this articulation are seven in number,— Two anterior occipito-atloid. Posterior occipito-atloid. Lateral occipito-atloid. Two capsular. Of the two anterior ligaments one is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line, and superficially to the other.

The deeper ligament is a broad membranous layer, attached above, to the margin of the occipital foramen ; and below, to the whole length of the artterior arch of the atlas. It is in relation in front with the recti antici minores and behind with the odontoid ligaments. The posterior ligament is thin and membranous ; it is attached above, to the margin of the occipital foramen ; and below, to the pos- terior arch of the atlas. It is closely adherent to the dura mater, by its inner surface ; and forms a ligamentous arch at each side, for the passage of the vertebral arteries and first cervical nerves. It is in Fig. 56.* relation posteriorly with the recti postici minores and obliqui supe- riores. The lateral ligaments are strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, attached below, to the base of the transverse process of the atlas at each side, and above, to the [transverse process of the occipital bone. With a ligamentous expansion derived from the vaginal process of the temporal bone, these ligaments form a strong sheath around the vessels and nerves which pass through the carotid and jugular foramina. The capsular ligaments are the thin and loose ligamentous capsides, which surround the synovial membranes of the articulations between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articidar processes of the atlas. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous upon the anterior and external part of the articulation. * The posterior ligaments of the occipito-atloid, and atlo-axoid articulations. 1. The atlas. 2.

The movements taking place between the cranium and atlas, are those of flexion and erection, giving rise to the forward nodding of the head. When this motion is increased to any extent the whole of the cen-ical region concurs in its production. 3. Articulation of the Axis with the Occipital bone.—The ligaments of this articulation are three in number,— Occipito-axoid, Two odontoid. The occipito-axoid ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a broad band, which covers in the odontoid process and its ligaments. It is attached below to the body of the axis, where it is continuous with the posterior common ligament ; superiorly it is inserted by a broad Fig. 51* expansion, into the basilar groove of the occipital bone. It is firmly connected opposite the body of the axis, with the dura mater ; and sometimes is described as consisting of a central and two lateral por- tions ; this however is an unnecessary refinement. The odontoid ligaments (alar) are two short and thick fasciculi of fibres, which pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process, to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. A third and smaller fasciculus (ligamentum suspensorium) proceeds from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. These ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the head may be carried, hence they are termed check ligaments. • The upper part of the vertebral canal, opened from behind in order to shew the occipito-axoid ligament. 1.

Transverse. The anterior ligament consists of ligamentous fibres, which pass from the anterior tubercle and arch of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis, Avhere they are continuous with the commencement of the anterior common ligament. The posterior ligament is a thin and membranous layer, passing be- tween the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminae of the axis. The capsular ligaments surround the articular processes of the atlas and axis ; they are loose, to permit of the freedom of movement which subsists between these vertebrae. The ligamentous fibres are most Fig. 58.* numerous on the outer and anterior part of the articulation, and the synovial membrane usually communicates with the synovial cavity situated between the transverse ligament and the odontoid process. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band, which arches across the area of the ring of the atlas from a rough tubercle upon the inner surface of one articular process to a similar tubercle on the other. It serves to retain the odontoid process of the axis, in connection with the anterior arch of the atlas. As it crosses the odontoid process, * A posterior view of the ligaments connecting the atlas, the axis, and the occipital bone.

'a125 LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. some fibres are sent downwards to be attached to the body of the axis, and others pass upwards to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone ; hence the ligament has a cross-like appearance, and has been denominated cmciforin. A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligament and the odontoid process ; and another between that process and the inner surface of the anterior arch of the atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiar disposition of this ligament in relation to the odontoid process, that enables the atlas, and with it the entire cranium, to rotate upon the axis ; the perfect freedom of movement between these bones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower part of the ring, formed by the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, while the smnmit of the odontoid process is larger than its base ; so that the process is still retained in its position by the transverse ligament, when the other ligaments are cut through. The extent to which the rotation of the head upon the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axoid ligament. 5. Articulation of the Lower Jaw.—The lower jaw has properly but one ligament, the external lateral; the ligaments usually described are three in number ; to which may be added, as appertaining to the mechanism of the joint, an interarticular fibrous-cartilage, and two synovial membranes,— External lateral. Internal lateral. Capsular. Interarticular fibrous cartilage, Two synovial membranes. • An external view of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1. The zygomatic arch. 2. The tubercle of the zygoma. 3. The ramus of the lower jaw. 4. The mastoid portion of the temporal bone. 5. The external lateral ligament. 6. The stylo-maxillary ligament.LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. 126 The external lateral ligament is a short and thick hand of fibres, passing obliquely backwards from the tubercle of the zygoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. It is in relation, ex- ternaUy with the integument of the face, and internally with the two synovial membranes of the articulation and the interarticular cartilage. The external lateral ligament acts conjointly with its fellow of the op- posite side of the head in the movements of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament has no connection with the articulation of the lower jaw, and is incorrectly named in relation to that joint; it is a thin aponeurotic expansion extending from the extremity of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the margin of the dental fora- men. It is pierced at its insertion by the m}do-hyoidean nerve. A triangular space is left between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the jaw, in which are situated the internal maxillary artery and auricular nerve, the inferior dental artery and nen'e, and a part of the external pterygoid muscle ; internally it is in relation with the internal pterygoid muscle. The capsular ligament consists of numerous irregular ligamentous Fig. 60.* fibres, which pass from the edge of the glenoid cavity to the neck of the lower jaw, and surround the articulation; on the inner side of the joint they form a pretty strong fasciculus. The interarticular fibrous cartilage is a thin oval plate, thicker at the edges than in the centre, and placed horizontally between the head of the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity. It is connected * An internal view of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1. A section through the petrous portion of the tempoj-al bone and spinous process of the sphenoid. 2.

Occasionally it is incomplete in the centre. It divides the joint into two distinct cavities, the one being above and the other below the cartilage. The spwvial membranes are situated the one above, the other below the fibrous cartilage, the former being the larger of the two. When the fibrous cartilage is perforate, the synovial membranes communi- cate. Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete interarticular cartilage, and, consequently, with two syno- vial membranes ; they are, the stemo-elavicular articulation, the acro- mio-clavicular, and the articulation of the ulna with the cuneiform bone. The interarticular fibrous-cartilages of the knee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membiRne. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament with- out fibrous-cartilage. Fig. 61.* fictions.—The movements of the lower jaw are depression, by which the mouth is opened; elevation, by which it is closed ; a forward and baekward movement, and a movement from side to side.

If this movement be carried too far, the superior synovial membrane is ruptured, and dislocation of the fibro-cartilage with its condyle into the zygomatic fossa occurs. In elevation the fibrous cartilage and con- dyle are returned to their original position. The forward and back- ward movement is a gliding of the fibro-cartilage upon the glenoid articular surface, in the antero-posterior direction ; and the movement from side to side, in the lateral direction. 6. Articulation of the Ribs with the Vertebra.—The ligaments of these articulations are so strong as to render dislocation impossible; the neck of the rib would break before displacement could occur; they are divisible into two groups :—1. Those connecting the head of the rib with the bodies of the vertebra ; and, 2. Those connecting the neck and tubercle of the nb with the transverse processes. They are 1st Group. Anterior costo-vertebral or stellate. Capsular, Interarticular ligament. Two synovial membranes. 2nd Group. Anterior costo-transverse. Middle costo-transverse, Posterior costo-transverse. The anterior costo-vertebral or stellate ligament (fig. 52) consists of three short bands of ligamentous fibres that radiate from the anterior part of the head of the rib. The superior band passes upwards, and is attached to the vertebra above ; the middle fasciculus is attached to the intervertebral substance; and the inferior, to the vertebra below. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, the three fasciculi are attached to the body of the corresponding vertebra. The capsular ligament is a thin layer of ligamentous fibres sur- rounding the joint in the interval left by the anterior ligament; it is thickest above and below the articulation, and protects the sjuiovial membranes. The interarticular ligament is a thin band which passes between the sharp crest on the head of the rib and the intervertebral substance. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are each furnished \vith a separate synovial membrane. The first, eleventh, and tivelfth ribs have no interarticular ligament, and consequently but one synovial mem- brane. The antefior costo-transverse ligament is a broad band composed of several fasciculi, which ascend from the crest-like ridge on the neck of the rib, to the transverse process immediately above. This ligament129 LIGAMENTS OF THE RIBS. separates the anterior from the posterior branch of the intercostal nerve. The middle costo-transverse ligament is a very strong interosseous ligament passing directly between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib, and the transverse process against which it rests. The posterior costo-transverse ligament is a small but strong fascicu- lus, passing obliquely from the tubercle of the rib, to the apex of the transverse process. The articulation between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process is provided with a small synovial mem- brane. There is no anterior costo-transverse ligament to the first rib ; and only rudimentary posterior costo-transverse ligaments to the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Actions.—The movements permitted by the articulations of the ribs are upwards and doum- wards, and slightly forwards and bachvards; the movement increasing in extent from the head to the extremity of the rib. The forward and back- ward movement is very trifling in the seven superior, but great- er in the inferior ribs; the eleventh and twelfth are very movable. 7. Articulation of the Ribs •with the Sternum, and with each other.—The ligaments of the costo-stemal articulations are,— Anterior costo-stemal. Posterior costo-stemal, Superior costo-stemal, Inferior costo-stemal. Synovial membranes. The anterior costo-sternal ligament is a thin band of ligamentous fibres, that passes in a radiated direction from the extremity of the costal cartilage to the anterior surface of the sternum, and intermingles its fibres with those of the ligament of the opposite side and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoralis major muscle. The posterior costo-stemal ligament is much smaller than the ante- rior, and consists of a thin fasciculus of fibres situated on the posterior surface of the articulation. • A posterior view of a part of the thoracic portion of the vertebral column, shewing the ligaments connecting the vertebrte with each other and the ribs with the vertebrte. 1, 1.

KLIGAMENTS OF THE STERNUM. 130 The superior and inferior costo-stemal ligaments are narrow fasciculi corresponding with the breadth of the cartilage, and connecting its superior and inferior border with the side of the sternum. The synovial membrane is absent in the articulation of the first rib, its cartilage being usually continuous with the sternum ; that of the second rib has an inter-articular ligament, with two synovial mem- branes. The siadh and seventh ribs have several fasciculi of strong ligament- ous fibres, passing from the extremity of their cartilages to the anterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, which latter they are intended to support. They are named the costo-xyphoid ligaments. The sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes Xhe fifth and the ninth costal cartilages, have articulations with each other, and a perfect synovial membrane at each articulation. They are connected by liga- mentous fibres which pass from one cartilage to the other, external and internal ligaments. The ninth and tenth are connected at their extremities by ligament- ous fibres, but have no synovial membranes. Actions.—The movements of the costo-stemal articidations are very trifling ; they are limited to a slight degree of sliding motion. The first rib is the least, and the second the most movable. 8. Articulation of the Sternum.—The pieces of the sternum are connected by means of a thin plate of interosseous cartilage placed be- tween each, and by an anterior and posterior ligament. The fibres of the anterior sternal ligament are longitudinal in direction, but so blended with the anterior costo-stemal ligaments, and the tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoral muscles, as scarcely to be distinguished as a distinct ligament. The posterior sternal ligament is a broad smooth plane of longitudinal fibres, placed upon the posterior surface of the bone, and extending from the manubrium to the ensiform car- tilage. These ligaments contribute very materially to the strength of the sternum and to the elasticity of the front of the chest. 9. Articulation of the Vertebral Column with the Pelvis.—The last lumbar vertebra is connected ^vith the sacrum by the same ligaments with which the various vertebrae are connected to each other ; viz. the anterior and posterior common ligaments, intervertebral substance, ligamenta subflava, capsular ligaments, and inter and supra-spinous ligaments. There are, however, two proper ligaments connecting the vertebral column with the pelvis ; these are, the Lumbo-sacral, Lumbo-iliac. The lumbo-sacral ligament is a thick triangular fasciculus of ligament- ous fibres, connected above with the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and below with the posterior part of the upper bor- der of the sacrum. The lumbo-iliao ligament passes from the apex of the transverse131 LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. process of the last lumbar vertebra to that part of the crest of the ilium which surmounts the sacro-iliac articulation. It is triangular in form. 10. The Articulations of the Pelvis.—The ligaments belonging to the articulations of the pelvis are divisible into four groups:—1. Those connecting the sacrum and ilium; 2. those passing between the sacrum and ischium; 3. between the sacrum and coccyx; and, 4, be- tween the two pubic bones. 1st, Between the sacrum and ilium. Sacro-iliac anterior, Sacro-iliac posterior. 2nd, Between the sacrum and ischium. Sacro-ischiatic anterior (short), Sacro-ischiatic posterior (long). 3rd, Beticeen the sacrum and coccyx. Sacro-coccygean anterior, Sacro-coccygean posterior. 4th, Between the ossa pubis. Anterior pubic. Posterior pubic, Superior pubic. Sub-pubic, Interosseous fibro-cartilage. 1. Between the Sacrum and Ilium.—The anterior sacro-iliac liga- ment consists of numerous short ligamentous fibres, which pass from bone to bone on the anterior surface of the joint. The posterior sacro-iliac or interosseous ligament is composed of nu- merous strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which pass horizontally between the rough surfaces of the posterior half oi the sacro-iliac arti- culation, and constitute the principal bond of connection between the sacrum and the ilium. One fasciculus of this ligament, longer and larger than the rest, is distinguished, from its direction, by the name of the oblique sacro-iliac ligament. It is attached, by one extremity, to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; and, by the other, to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum. The surfaces of the two bones forming the sacro-iliac articulation are partly covered with cartilage, and partly rough and connected by the interosseous ligament. The anterior or auricular half is coated with cartilage, which is thicker on the sacrum than on the ilium.' The surface of the cartilage is irregular, and provided with a very delicate synovial membrane, which cannot be demonstrated in the adult, but is apparent in the young subject and in the female during pregnancy. 2. Between the Sacrum and Ischium.—The anterior or lesser sacro- ischiatic ligament is thin, and triangular in form ; it is attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium ; and by its broad extremity to theFig. 63.* LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. 132 side of the sacrum and coccyx, interlacing its fibres with the greater sacro-ischiatic ligament. The anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the coccygeus muscle, and behind with the posterior ligament; Avith which its fibres are intermingled. By its upper border it forms a part of the lower boundary of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and by the lower a part of the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. The 'posterior or greater sacro-ischiatio ligament, considerably larger, thicker, and more posterior than the preceding, is narrower in the middle than at each extremity. It is attached, by its smaller end, to the inner margin of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium, Avhere it forms a falciform process, which protects the internal pudic artery, and is continuous with the obturator fascia. By its larger extremity it is inserted into the side of the coccyx, sacrum, and posterior inferior spine of the ilium. The posterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the anterior ligament, and behind Avith the gluteus maximus, to some of the fibres of which it gives origin. By its superior border it forms * The ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint. 1. The loAver part of the ante- rior common ligament of the vertebras, extending dovmwards over the front of the sacrum.

The two ligaments convert the sacro-ischiatic notches into foramina. Fig. 64.* 3. Between the Sacrum and Coccyx,—The anterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thin fasciculus passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The posterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and connects the sacrum with the coccyx posteriorly, extending as far as the apex of the latter bone. Between the two bones is a thin disk of soft fibrous cartilage. In females there is frequently a small synovial membrane. This articu- lation admits of a certain degree of movement backwards during parturition. • Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint.

The ligaments connecting the different pieces of the coccyx consist of a few scattered anterior and posterior fibres, and a thin disk of in- terosseous cartilage; they exist only in the young subject, in the adult the pieces become ossified. 4. Between the Ossa Pubis,—The anterior pubic ligament is com- posed of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely across the union of the two bones from side to side, and form an interlacement in front of the symphysis. The posterior pvhic ligament consists of a few irregular fibres uniting the pubic bones posteriorly. The superior pubic ligament is a thick band of fibres connecting the angles of the pubic bones superiorly, and filling the inequalities upon the surface of the bones. The sub-pubic ligament is a thick arch of fibres connecting the two bones inferiorly, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. The interosseous fbro-eartilage unites the two surfaces of the pubic bones, in the same manner as the intervertebral substance connects the bodies of the vertebrae. It resembles the intervertebral substance also in being composed of oblique fibres disposed in concentric layers, which are more dense towards the surface than near the centre. It is thick in front, and thin behind. A synovial membrane is sometimes found in the posterior half of the articulation. This articulation becomes movable towards the latter term of preg- nancy, and admits of a slight degree of separation of its surfaces. The obturator ligament or membrane is not a ligament of articula- tion, but simply a fibrous membrane stretched across the obturator foramen. It gives attachment by its surfaces to the two obturator muscles, and leaves a space in the upper part of the foramen, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The numerous vacuities in the walls of the pelvis, and their closure by ligamentous structures, as in the case of the sacro-ischiatic fissures and obturator foramina, serve to diminish very materially the pressure on the soft parts during the passage of the head of the foetus through the pelvis in parturition.

Sterna-clavicular Artiadaiion.—The stemo-clavicular is an ar- throdial articulation j its ligaments are, Anterior stemo-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular. Inter-clavicular, Costo-clavicular {rhomboid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes. The anterior stemo-davicidar ligament is a broad ligamentous layer, extending obliquely downwards and forwards, and covering the ante- rior aspect of the articulation. This ligament is in relation by its anterior surface mth the integument and with the sternal origin of the stemo-mastoid muscle ; and behind with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and sjmovial membranes. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad fasciculus, cover- ing the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and synovial membranes, and behind with the sterno-hyoid muscle. The two ligaments are continuous at the upper and lower part of the articulation, so as to form a complete capsule around the joint. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely con- nected with the upper border of the sternum. It is separated by areolar tissue from the stemo-thy^roid muscles. The costo-clavicular ligament (rhomboid^ is a thick fasciculus of fibres, connecting the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the carti- lage of the first rib. It is situated obliquely between the rib and the under surface of the clavicle ; and is in relation, in front, with the ten- don of origin of the subclavius muscle, and behind with the subclavian vein. Actions.—The movements of the sterno-clavicular articulation are, a gliding movement of the fibro-cartilage, with the clavicle, upon the articular surface of the sternum, in the direction, forwards, backwards, upwards, and downwards ; and circumduction. This articulation is the centre of the movements of the shoulder. It is the rupture of the rhomboid ligament in dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle that gives rise to the deformity peculiar to this accident. The interarticular fil/ro-cartilage is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the edges than in the centre. It is attached above, to the clavicle; below, to the cartilage of the first rib ; and throughout the rest of its circumference to the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular136 SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. ligaments. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are lined by distinct synovial membranes. This cartilage is sometimes pierced through its centre, and not unfrequently deficient, to a greater or less extent, at its lower part. Fig. 65.* 2. Scapvlo-clavieular Atiictdation.—The ligaments of the scapular end of the clavicle are, the Superior acromio-clavicular, Inferior acromio-clavicular, Coraco-clavicular (trapezoid and conoid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes. The superior acromio-clavieidar ligament is a. moderately thick plane of superimposed fibres passing between the extremity of the clavicle and the acromion, upon the upper surfece of the joint. The inferior acromio-clavicular ligament is a thin plane situated upon the under surface. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a complete capsule around the joint. The coraco-clavicular ligament (trapezoid, conoid) is a thick fasci- culus of ligamentous fibres, passing obliquely between the base of the coracoid process and the under surface of the clavicle, and holding the end of the clavicle in firm connection with the scapula. When seen from before, it has a quadrilateral form ; hence it is named trapezoid: and, examined from behind, it has a triangular form, the base being upwards ; hence another name, conoid. The interarticular fhro-cartilage is often indistinct, from having * The ligaments of the stemo-clavicular and costo-stemal articulations. 1. The anterior stemo-clavicular ligament. 2.

When partial, it occupies the upper part of the articulation. The synovial membranes are very delicate. There is, of course, hut one, when the fibro-cartilage is incomplete. Fig. 66.* Actions.—The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two move- ments—the gliding of the surfaces upon each other, and the rotation of the scapula upon the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are the Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament is a broad and thick triangular hand, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion process, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually interposed. • The ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1, The superior acromio- clavicular ligament. 2.

Shoulder Joint, — The scapulo-humeral articulation is an enarthrosis, or ball and socket joint—its ligaments are, the Capsular, Coraco-humeral, Glenoid. The capsular ligament completely encircles the articidating head of the scapula and the head of the humerus, and is attached to the neck of each bone. It is thick above, where resistance is most required, and is strength- ened by the tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus. teres minor, and subscapularis muscles; below it is thin and loose. The with the tendons, so that they obtain upon their inner surface a covering of synovial mem- * brane. j The coraco-humeral ligament is a broad ..J band which descends obliquely outwards from j the border of the coracoid process to the greater tuberosity of the humerus,and serves to strength- en the superior and anterior part of the capsu- lar ligament. The glenoid ligament is the prismoid band of fibro-cartilage, which is attached around the margin of the glenoid cavity for the purposes , of protecting its edges and deepening its cavity. It divides supe- ■ riorly into two slips which are continuous with the long tendon of the ^ biceps ; hence the ligament is frequently described as being formed ] by the splitting of that tendon. The cavity of the articulation is m traversed by the long tendon of the biceps, which is enclosed in a S sheath of synovial membrane in its passage through the joint. ^ The synovial membrane of the shoulder joint is extensive ; it com- municates anteriorly through an opening in the capsular ligament % with a large bursal sac, which lines the under surface of the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Superiorly, it frequently communicates ^ through another opening in the capsular ligament with a bursal sac * An internal view of the ligaments of the elbow joint. 1. The anterior ligament. 2.

The muscles immediately surrounding the shoulder joint are the subscapularis, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, long head of the triceps, and deltoid ; the long tendon of the biceps is within the capsulai' ligament. Actiojis.—The shoulder joint is capable of every variety of motion, viz. of movement for- wards and backwards, of abduction and adduc- tion, of circumduction and rotation. 5. Elbcnu Joint.—The elbow is a ginglymoid articulation ; its ligaments are foxir in num- ber,— Anterior, Posterior, Internal lateral, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer, descending from the an- terior sruface of the humerus, immediately above the joint, to the coronoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament. On each side it is connected with the lateral ligaments. It is composed of fibres which pass in three different directions, vertical, transverse, and oblique, the latter, being extended from within outwards to the orbicular ligament, into which they are attached inferiorly. This ligament is covered in by the brachialis anticus muscle. The posterior ligament is a broad and loose layer passing between the posterior smface of the humerus and the anterior surface of the base of the olecranon, and connected at each side with the lateral ligaments. It is covered in by the tendon of the triceps. The internal lateral ligament is a thick tri- angular layer, attached above, by its apex, to the internal condyle of the humerus ; and be- low, by its expanded border, to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, extending from the coronoid process to the olecra- non. At its insertion it is intermingled with some transverse fibres. * An external view of the elbow joint. 1. The humerus. 2. The ulna. 3. The radius. 4.

The internal lateral ligament is in relation posteriorly with the ulnar nerves The eodernal lateral ligament is a strong and narrow band, which descends from the external condyle of the humerus, to be inserted into the orbicular ligament, and into the ridge on the ulna with which the posterior part of the latter ligament is connected. This ligament is closely united with the tendon of origin of the supinator brevis muscle. The synovial membrane is extensive, and is reflected from the carti- laginous surfaces of the hones upon the inner surface of the ligaments. It surrounds inferiorly the head of the radius, and forms an articulat- ing sac between it and the lesser sigmoid notch. The muscles immediately surrounding, and in contact with, the elbow joint are, in front, the brachialis anticus ; to the irnier side, the pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris; eocternally, the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and supinator brevis; and behind, the triceps. Actions.—The movements of the elbow joint areflexion and extefision, which are performed with remarkable precision. The extent to which these movements are capable of being effected, is limited, in front b}’' the coronoid process, and behind by the olecranon. 6. The Radio-ulnar Articulation.—The radius and ulna are firmly held together by ligaments which are connected with both extremities of the bones, and with the shaft; they are, the Orbicular, Anterior inferior. Oblique, Posterior inferior. Interosseous, Interarticular fibro-cartilage. The orbicular ligament {annidar, coronary) is a firm band several lines in breadth, which surrounds the head of the radius, and is at- tached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity. It is strongest behind where it receives the external lateral ligament, and is lined on its inner surface by a reflection of the synovial mem- brane of the elbow joint. The rupture of this ligament permits of the dislocation of the head of the radius. The oblique ligament (called also ligamentiun teres, in contradistinc- tion to the interosseous ligament) is a narrow slip of ligamentous fibres, descending obliquely from the base of the coronoid process of the ulna to the inner side of the radius, a little below its tuberosity. The interosseous ligament is a broad and thin plane of aponeurotic fibres passing obliquely downwards from the sharp ridge on the radius to that on the ulna. It is deficient superiorlj% is broader in the middle than at each extremity, and is perforated at its lower part for the pas- sage of the*anterior interosseous artery. The posterior interosseous artery passes backwards between the oblique ligament and the upperWRIST JOINT. ]41 border of the interosseous ligament. This ligament affords an exten- sive surface for the attachment of muscles. The interosseous ligament is in relation, in front, with the flexor profundus digitorum, the flexor longus poUicis, and pronator quadratus muscle, and with the anterior interosseous artery and nerve ; and be- hind with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, ex- tensor primi intemodii pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and extensor indicis muscle, and near the wrist with the anterior in- terosseous artery and posterior interosseous nerve. The anterior inferior ligament is a thin fasciculus of fibres, passing transversely between the radius and ulna. The posterior inferior ligament is also thin and loose, and has the same disposition on the posterior surface of the articulation. The interarticular, or triangular jihro-cartilage, acts the part of a ligament between the lower extremities of the radius and ulna. It is attached by its apex to a depression on the inner surface of the styloid process of the ulna, and by its base to the edge of the radius. This fibro-cartilage is lined upon its upper surface by a synovial membrane, which forms a duplicature between the radius and ulna, and is called the membrana sacciformis. By its lower surface it enters into the ar- ticulation of the wrist-joint. Actions.—The movements taking place between the radius and the ulna are, the rotation of the former upon the latter; rotation forwards being termed pronation, and rotation backwards supination. In these movements the head of the radius turns upon its own axis, within the orbicular ligament and the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna ; while inferiorly the radius presents a concavity which moves upon the roimded head of the ulna. The movements of the radius are chiefly limited by the anterior and posterior inferior ligaments ; hence these are not unfrequently ruptured in great muscular efforts. 7. Wrist Joint.—The wrist is a ginglymoid articulation; the arti- cular surfaces entering into its formation being the radius and under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage above, and the rounded surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone below ; its ligaments are four in number,— Anterior, Internal lateral. Posterior, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a broad and membranous layer consisting of three fasciculi, which pass between the lower part of the radius and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone. The posterior ligament, also thin and loose, passes between the posterior surface of the radius, and the posterior surface of the semi- lunar and cuneiform bone. The internal lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform and pisiform bone. The external lateral ligament is attached by one extremity to the styloid process of the radius, and by the other to the side of the sea-142 CARPAL ARTICULATIONS. phoid bone. The radial artery rests on this ligament as it passes backwards to the first metacarpal space. The synovial membrane of the wrist joint lines the under surface of the radius and interarticular cartilage above, and the first row of bones of the carpus below. The rdations of the wrist joint are the flexor and exten- sor tendons by which it is sur- rounded, and the radial and ulnar arterj\ Aetions.—The movements of the wrist joint are flexion^ ex- tension, adduction,, abduction, and circumduction. In these motions the articular surfaces glide upon each other. 8. Articulations between the Carpal Bones.—These are am- phi-arthrodial joints, with the exception of the conjoined head of the os magnum and unci- forme, which is received into a cup formed by the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone, and constitutes an enarthrosis. The ligaments are, Dorsal, Palmar, Interosseous fibro-cartilage. Anterior annular.

The palmar ligaments are fasciculi of the same kind, but stronger than the dorsal, having the like disposition on the palmar surface. The inierosseom ligaments are fibro-cartilaginous lamellae situated between the adjoining bones in each range : in the upper range they close the upper part of the spaces between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones; in the lower range they are stronger than in the upper, and connect the os magnum on the one side to the unciforme, on the other to the trapezoides, and leave intervals through which the synovial membrane is continued to the bases of the metacarpal bones. The anterior annular ligament is a firm ligamentous band, which connects the bones of the two sides of the carpus. It is attached by one extremity to the trapezium and scaphoid, and by the other to the unciform process of the unciforme and the base of the pisiform bone, and forms an arch over the anterior surface of the carpus, beneath which the tendons of the long flexors and the median nerve pass into the palm of the hand. The articulation of tlve pisiform hone with the cuneiform is provided with a distinct sjmovial membrane, which is protected bj’’ fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, forming a kind of capsule around the joint; they are inserted into the cuneiforme, unciforme, and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Synovial Membranes.—There are five synovial membranes entering into the composition of the articulations of the carpus :— The first is situated between the lower end of the ulna and the in- terarticular fibro-cartilage ; it is called sacciform, from forming a sac- culus between the lateral articulation of the ulna with the radius. The second is situated between the lower surface of the radius and interarticular fibro-cartilage above, and the first range of bones of the carpus beloiu. The third is the most extensive of the synovial membranes of the wrist; it is situated between the two rows of carpal bones, and passes between the bones of the second range, to invest the carpal extremities of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers. The fourthis the synovial membrane of the articulation of the meta- carpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. The fifth is situated between the pisiform and cuneiform bone. Actions.—Very little movement exists between the bones in each range, but more is permitted between the two ranges. The motions in the latter situation are those of flexion and extension. 9. The Carpo-metacarpal Articulations.—The second row of bones of the carpus articulates with the metacarpal bones of the four fingers by dorsal and palmar ligaments ; and the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium by a true capsular ligament. There is also in the carpo-metacarpal articulation a thin interosseous band, which passes from the ulnar edge of the os magnum to the bases of the third and fourth metacarpal bones at their point of connection.144 CARP0-METACARP4L ARTICULATIONS. The dorsal ligaments are strong fasciculi which pass from the second range of carpal to the metacarpal bones. The palmar ligaments are thin fasciculi arranged upon the same plan on the palmar surface. The synovial membrane is a continuation of the great synovial membrane of the two rows of carpal bones. The capsular ligament of the thumb is one of the three true capsular ligaments of the skeleton ; the other two being the shoulder joint and hip joint. The articulation has a proper synovial membrane.

Actions.—The movements of the metacarpal on the carpal bones are restricted to a slight degree of sliding motion, with the exception of the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trape- zium. In the latter articulation, the movements flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. 10. Metacarpo-phalangeal A rtipulation. — The metacarpo-phalan- geal articulation is a ginglymoid joint: its ligaments are four in number,— Anterior, T wo lateral. Transverse. The anterior ligaments are thick and fibro-cartilaginous, and form part of the articulating surface of the joints. They are grooved ex- ternally for the lodgment of the flexor tendons, and by their internal aspect form part of the articular surfe.ce for the head of the metacarpal bone. The lateral ligaments are strong narrow fasciculi, holding the bones together at each side. The transverse ligaments are strong ligamentous bands passing be- tween the anterior ligaments, and connecting together the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers. The expansion of the extensor tendon over the back of the fingers takes the place of a posterior bgament. Actions.—This articulation admits of movement in four diflerent directions, viz. flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction, the two latter being limited to a small extent. It is also capable of drcunv- duction. 11. Articulation of the Phalanges.—These articulations are gingly- moid joints : they are formed by three ligaments. Anterior, Two lateral. The anterior ligament is firm and fibro-cartilaginous, and forms part . of the articular surface for the head of the phalanges. Externally it is ; grooved for the reception of the flexor tendons. The lateral ligaments are very strong ; they are the principal bond ' of connection between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the office of a posterior ligament. Actkms.—The movements of the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension, these movements being more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. In connection with the phalanges it may be proper to examine cer- ' tain fibrous bands termed thcccc or vaginal ligaments, which serve to ' retain the tendons of the flexor muscles in their position upon the flat L146 HIP JOINT. surface of the bones. These fibrous bands are attached at each side to the lateral margins of the phalanges; they are thick in the inter- spaces of the joints, thin where the tendons lie upon the joints, and they are lined upon their inner surface by sjmovial membrane.

Hip Joint.—The articulation of the head of the femur with the \ acetabulum constitutes an enarthrosis, or ball and socket joint. The articular surfaces are the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum and the rounded head of the femur ; the ligaments are in number, viz. • The capsular ligament (fig. 63, 8) is a strong ligamentous capside, embracing the acetabulum superiorly, and inferiorly the neck of the femur, and connecting the two bones firmly together. It is much thicker upon the upper part of the joint, where more resistance' is re- | quired, than upon the under part, and extends farther upon the neck 4 of the femur on the anterior and superior than on the posterior and * inferior side, being attached to the intertrochanteric line in front, to the base of the great trochanter above, and to the middle of the neck of the femur behind. The iliofemoral ligament (fig. 63, 9) is an accessor}' and radiating band, which descends obliquely from the anterior inferior spinous pro- cess of the ilium to the anterior intertrochanteric line, and strengthens the anterior portion of the capsular ligament. The ligamentum teres (fig. 64, 7), triangular in shape, is attached by a round apex to the depression just below the middle of the head of the femur, and by its base, which divides into two fasciculi, into the borders of the notch of the acetabulum. It is formed by a ■_ fasciculus of fibres, of variable size, surrounded by synovial membrane; sometimes the synovial membrane alone exists, or the ligament is H wholly ab^nt.

It is much thicker upon the upper and posterior border of the acetabulum than in front, and con- sists of fibres which arise from the whole circumference of the brim, and interlace with each other at acute angles. The transverse ligament is a strong fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the cotyloid ligament, and extended across the notch in the acetabulum. It converts the notch into a foramen, through which the articular branches of the internal circumflex and obturator arteries enter the joint. The fossa at the bottom of the acetabulum is filled by a mass of fat, covered by synovial membrane, which serves as an elastic cushion to the head of the bone during its movements. This was considered by Havers as the sjniovial gland. The synovial membrane is extensive ; it invests the head of the femur, and is continued around the ligamentum teres into the ace- tabulum, whence it is reflected upon the inner surface of the capsular ligament back to the head of the bone. The muscles immediately surrounding and in contact with the hip- joint are, in front, the psoas and iliacus, which are separated from the capsular ligament by a large synovial bursa ; above, the short head of the rectus, and the gluteus minimus ; behind, the pyriformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, and quadratus femoris ; and to the inner side, the obturator externus and pectineus. Actions.—The movements of the hip-joint are very extensive; they are flexion, eoctension, adduction, abduction, circumduction and rotation. 2. Knee Joint.—The knee is a ginglymoid articulation of large size, and is provided with numerous ligaments ; they are thirteen in number. Anterior or ligamentum patellae. Posterior or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, Internal lateral. Two external lateral, Anterbr or external crucial, Posterior or internal crucial. Transverse, Two coronary, Ligamentum mucosum, I ^ T• I talse liqamcnts. Two semilunar fibro-cartilages. Synovial membrane. The first five are external to the articulation; the next five are internal to the articulation ; the remaining three are mere folds of synovial membrane, and have no title to the name of ligaments. In addition to the ligaments, there are two fibro-cartilages, which are sometimes veiy erroneously considered among the ligaments; and a synovial membrane.148 KNEE JOINT. The anterior ligament, or ligamentum patellcB, is the prolongation of the tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh downwards to the tubercle of the tibia. It is, therefore, no ligament; and, as we have before stated that the patella is simply a sesamoid bone developed in the tendon of the extensor muscles for the defence of the front of the knee joint, the ligamentum patellae has no title to consider- ation, either as a ligament of the knee joint or as a ligament of the patella. A small bursa mucosa is situated be- tween the ligamentum patellae, near its in- sertion and the front of the tibia, and an- other of larger size is placed between the anterior surface of the patella and the fascia lata. It is the latter which is inflamed in “ housemaid’s knee.” The posterior ligament, ligamentum pos- ticum Winsloiuii, is a broad expansion of ligamentous fibres which covers the whole of the posterior part of the joint. It is divisible into two lateral portions which invest the condyles of the femur, and a central portion which is depressed, and formed by the interlacement of fasciculi passing in different directions. The strong- est of these fasciculi is that which is de rived from the tendon of fhe semi-membranosus and passes obliquely upwards and outwards, from the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur. Other accessory fasciculi are given off by the tendon of the popliteus and by the heads of the gastrocnemius. The middle portion of the ligament supports the popliteal artery and vein, and is perforated by several openings for the passage of branches of the azygos articular artery, and for the nerves of the joint. The internal lateral ligament is a broad and trapezoid layer of ligamentous fibres, attached above to the tubercle on the internal con- dyle of the femur, and below to the side of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. It is crossed at its lower part bj' the tendons of the inner hamstring from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, and it covers in the anterior slip of the semi-membranosus tendon and the inferior internal articular artery. External lateral ligaments.—The long external lateral ligament is a strong rounded cord, which descends from the posterior part of the * An anterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. 1.

The short external lateral ligament is an irregular fascicidus situated behind the preceding, arising from the external Fig. 72.* condyle near the origin of the head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and inserted into the posterior part of the head of the fibula. It is firmly connected with the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and appears principally intended to con- nect that cartilage with the fibula. The long external lateral ligament is covered in by the tendon of the biceps, and has passing beneath it the tendon of origin of the popliteus muscle, and the inferior external articular artery. The true ligaments tvithin the joint are the crucial, transverse, and coro- nary. The anterior, or external crucial liga- ment, arises from the depression upon the head of the tibia in front of the spinous process, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the inner surface of the outer condyle of the femur, as far as its posterior border. It is smaller than the posterior. The posterior, or internal crucial ligament, arises from the depression upon the head of the tibia, behind the spinous process, and passes up- wards and forwards to be inserted into the inner condyle of the femur. This ligament is less oblique and larger than the anterior. The transverse ligament is a small slip of fibres which extends trans- versely from the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, near its anterior extremity, to the anterior convexity of the internal cartilage. The coronary ligaments are the short fibres by which the convex borders of the semilunar cartilages are connected to the head of the tibia, and to the ligaments surrounding the joint. The semilunar fibre-cartilages are two falciform plates of fibro- cartilage, situated around the margin of the head of the tibia, and serving to deepen the surface of articulation for the condyles of the femur. They are thick along their convex border, and thin and sharp along their concave edge. • A posterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. 1.

The external semilunar fibro-cartila/je bounds a circular fossa for the external condyle: it is connected by its convex border with the head of the tibia, and to the external and posterior ligaments by means of its coronary ligament; by its two extremities it is inserted into the depression between the two projections which constitute the spinous process of the tibia. The two extremities of the external cartilage being inserted in- to the same fossa, form almost a com- plete circle, and the cartilage being somewhat broader than the internal, it nearly covers the articular surface of the tibia. The external semilunar fibro- cartilage, besides giving off a fasciculus from its anterior border to constitute the transverse ligament, is continuous by some of its fibres with the extremity of the anterior crucial ligament ; poste- riorly it divides into three slips ; one, a strong cord, ascends obliquely forwards and is inserted into the anterior part of the inner condyle of the femur in front of the posterior crucial ligament; an- other is the fasciculus of insertion into the fossa of the spinous process ; and the third, of small size, is continuous Avith the posterior part of the anterior crucial ligament. The ligamentum mucosum is a slender conical process of synovial membrane enclosing a few ligamentous fibres which proceed from the transverse ligament. It is connected, by its apex, with the anterior part of the condyloid notch, and by its base is lost in the mass of fat which projects into the joint beneath the patella.

The alar ligaments are two fringed folds of synovial membrane, extending from the ligamentum mucosum, along the edges of the mass of fat to the sides of the patella. The synovial membrane of the knee joint is by far the most exten- sive in the skeleton. It invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the con- dyles of the femur, of the head of tibia, and of the inner surface of the patella; it covers both surfaces of the semilunar fibro-cartilages, and is reflected upon the crucial liga- ments, and upon the inner surface of the ligaments which form the cir- cumference of the joint. On each side of the patella, it lines the ten- dinous aponeuroses of the vastus in- temus and vastus extemus muscles, and forms a pouch of considerable size between the extensor tendon and the front of the femur. It also forms the folds in the interior of the joint, called “ligamentum mucosum,” and “ligamenta alaria.” The superior pouch of the synovial membrane is supported and raised during the movements of the limb by a small muscle, the subcrureus, which is inserted into it. Between the ligamentum patellae and the synovial membrane is a considerable mass of fat, which presses the membrane towards the interior of the joint, and occupies the fossa between the two con- dyles. • A longitudinal section of the left knee joint, shewing the reflections of its synovial membrane. 1.

It may be traced from the sacculus (at 8l, along the inner surface of the patella; then over the adipose mass (7) from which it throws off the mucous ligament (10); then over the head of the tibia, forming a sheath to the crucial ligaments; then upwai'ds along the posterior ligament and condyles of the femui’, to the sacculus whence its examination commenced.152 TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATIONS, Besides the proper ligaments of the articulation, the joint is pro- tected on its anterior part by the fascia lata, which is thicker upon the outer tlian upon the inner side, by a tendinous expansion from the vastus intemus, and by some scattered ligamentous fibres which are inserted into the sides of the patella. Actions.—The knee joint is one of the strongest of the articulations of the body, while at the same time it admits of the most perfect de- gree of movement in the directions of fleodon and extension. During flexion the articular surface of the tibia glides forward on the condyles of the femur; the lateral ligaments, the posterior, and the crucial liga- ments are relaxed ; while the ligamentum patellae, being put upon the stretch, serves to press the adipose mass into the vacuity formed in the front of the joint. In extension all the ligaments are put upon the stretch with the exception of the ligamentum patellae. When the knee is semi-flexed, a partial degree of rotation is permitted. 3. Articulation between the Tibia and Fibula.—The tibia and fibula are held firmly connected by means of seve?i ligaments, viz. Anterior, Posterior, s above. Interosseous membrane, Interosseous inferior. Anterior, ) Posterior, S Transverse. below. The anterior superior ligament is a strong fasciculus of parallel fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to the anterior surface of the head of the fibula. The posterior superior ligament is disposed in a similar manner on the posterior surface of the joint. Within the articulation there is a distinct synovial membrane which is sometimes continuous with that of the knee joint. The interosseous membrane, or superior interosseous ligament, is a broad layer of aponeurotic fibres which pass obliquely do^vnwards and outwards, from the sharp ridge on the tibia, to the inner edge of the fibula, and are crossed at an acute angle by a few fibres passing in the opposite direction. The ligament is deficient above, leaving a con- siderable interval between the bones, through which the anterior tibial artery takes its course forwards to the anterior aspect of the leg, and near its lower third there is an opening for the anterior peroneal artery and vein. The interosseous membrane is in relation, in front, with the tibia- lis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, and extensor proprius pollicis muscle, with the anterior tibial vessels and nerve, and with the ante- rior peroneal*artery ; and behind with the tibialis posticus, and flexor longus digitorum muscle, and with the posterior peroneal artery.153 ANKLE JOINT. i 1 i I The inferior interosseous ligameiit consists of short and strong fibres, which hold the bones firmly together inferiorly, where they are nearly in contact. This articulation is so firm, that the fibula is likely to be broken in the attempt to rupture the ligament. The anterior inferior ligament is a broad band, consisting of two fasciculi of parallel fibres which pass obliquely across the anterior aspect of the articulation of the two bones at their inferior extremity, from the tibia to the fibula. The posterior inferior ligament (fig. 77, 2) is a similar band upon the posterior surface of the articidation. Both ligaments project some- what below the margin of the bones, and senm to deepen the cavity of articulation with the astrag-alus. The trafisrerse ligameiit (fig. 77, 3) is a narrow band of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the preceding, and passing transversely across tha back of the ankle joint between the two malleoli. The synovial membrane of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation, is a duplicature of the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, reflected up- wards for a short distance between the two bones. Actions.—Between the tibia and fibula there exists an obscure de- gree of movement, which is principafly calculated to enable the latter to resist injury by yielding for a trifling extent to the pressure exerted. 4. Ankle joint.—The ankle is aginglymoid articulation; the surfaces entering into its formation are the under surface of the tibia with its malleolus and the malleolus of the fibula, above, and the surface of the astragalus with its two lateral facets, below. The ligaments are three in number: Anterior, Internal lateral. External lateral. The anterior ligament is a thin membranous layer, passing from the margin of the tibia, to the astragalus in front of the articular surface. It is in relation, in frmt, with the ex- tensor tendons of the great and lesser toes, with the tendons of the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, and with the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Posteriorly it lies in contact with the extra-sjmovial adi- pose tissue and with the synovial membrane. Fig. T5.* • An internal view of the ankle joint. 1.

The /. internal lateral or deltoid ligament. 7. The anterior ligament. 8. The tendo A Achillhi; a small bursa is seen interposed between this tendon and the tul)e- h rosity of the os calcis.tarsal articulations. 154 The internal lateral or deltoid ligament is a triangular layer of fibres, attached superiorly by its apex to the internal malleolus, and inferiorly by an expanded base to the astragalus, os calcis, and scaphoid bone. Beneath the superficial layer of this ligament is a much stronger and thicker fasciculus which connects the apex of the internal malleolus with the side of the astragalus. This internal lateral ligament is covered in and partly concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, and at its posterior part is in rela- tion with the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and with that of the flexor longus pollicis. The external lateral ligament consists of three strong fasciculi, which proceed from the inner side of the external malleolus, and diverge in three different directions. The anterior fasciculus passes foricards, and is attached to the astragalus; the •posterior, backwards, and is connected with the astragalus posteriorly ; and tlie middle, longer than the other two, descends to be inserted into the outer side of the os calcis. “ It is the strong union of this bone,” saj'^s Sir Astley Cooper, with the tarsal bones, by means of the external lateral ligaments, “ which leads to its being more frequently fractured than dislocated.” The transverse ligament of the tibia and fibula occupies the place of a posterior ligament. It is in relation, hehind, with the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and with the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle ; and in front, with the ex- tra-s}^novial adipose tissue, and sjmo'sdal membrane. The Synovial membrane invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the tibia and fibula (sending a duplicature upwards between their lower ends), and the upper surface and two sides of the astragalus. It is then re- flected upon the anterior and lateral ligaments, and upon the transverse ligament posteriorly. Aetions.—The movements of the ankle-joint are flexion mA extension only, without lateral motion. 5. Articulation of the Tarsal Bones.—The ligaments which connect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds,— * An external view of the ankle joint. 1. The tibia. 2.

Fig 76.*TARSAL ARTICULATIONS. 155 Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are small fasciculi of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it articulates. The only dorsal ligaments deserving of particular mention are, the ea:- ternal and posterior calcaneo-astragaloid, which, with the interosseous ligament, complete the articulation of the astragalus with the os calcis; the siiperior and internal calcaneo-evhoid ligaments ; and the superior astragalo-scaplioid ligament. The internal calcaneo-cuboid, and the superior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which are closely united poste- riorly in the deep groove which intervenes between the astragalus and os calcis, separate anteriorly to reach their respective bones; they form the principal bond of connection between the first and second range of the bones of the foot. It is the division of this portion of these liga- ments that demands the careful attention of the surgeon in perform- ing Chopart’s operation. The plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar sim- face of the foot ; three of them, however, are of large size, and have especial names, viz. the Calcaneo-scaphoid, Fig- 77.* Long calcrmeo-cuboid. Short calcaneo-cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament is a broad and fibro-cartilaginous band of ligament, which passes forwards from the anterior and inner border of the os calcis to the edge of the scaphoid bone. In addition to connecting the os calcis and scaphoid, it supports the astra- galus, and forms part of the cavity in which the rounded head of the latter bone is received. It is lined upon its upper surface by the synovial membrane of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation. The firm connection of the os calcis with the scaphoid bone, and the feebleness of the astra- galo-scaphoid articulation are conditions favor- able to the occasional dislocation of the head of the astragalus. The lory catcaneo-cidjoid, or ligamentum longum plantae., is a long band of ligamentous fibres, which proceeds from the under surface of the os calcis to the rough surface on the under part of the cuboid bone, • A posterior view of the ankle joint. 1.

This ligament forms the inferior boundary of a canal in the cuboid bone, through which the tendon of the peroneus longus passes to its insertion into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The short calcaneo-cuhoid, or ligarmntum hreve plantce, is situated nearer to the bones than the long plantar ligament, from which latter it is separated by adipose tissue; it is broad and extensive, and ties the under surfaces of the os calcis and cuboid bone firmly to- gether. The interosseous ligaments are five in number ; they are short and strong ligamentous fibres situated between adjoining bones, and firmlj' attached to their rough surfaces. One of these, the calcaneo-astraga- loid, is lodged in the groove between the upper surface of the os calcis and the lower of the astragalus. It is large and very strong, consists of vertical and oblique fibres, and serves to unite the os calcis and astra- galus solidly together. The second interosseous ligament, also very strong, is situated between the sides of the scaphoid and cuboid bone; while the three remaining interosseous ligaments connect strongly together the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid. The synovial membranes of the tarsus are four in number: one, for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; a second, for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulation. Oc- casionally an additional small synovial membrane is found in the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint; a third, for the calcaneo-cuboid articulation ; and a fourth, the large tarsal synovial membrane for the articulations between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones, the cuneiform bones with each other, the external cuneiform bone with the cuboid, and the two external cuneiform bones with the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones. The prolongation which reaches the metatarsal bones passes forwards between the internal and middle cuneiform bones. A small synovial membrane is sometimes met with between the contiguous surfaces of the scaphoid and cuboid bone. Actions.—The movements permitted by the articulation between the astragalus and os calcis, are a slight degree of gliding, in the direc- tions forivards and baclczvards, and laterally from side to side. The movements of the second range of tarsal bones are very trifling, being greater between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones than in the other articulations. The movements occurring between the first and second range are the most considerable : they are adduction and abduc- tion, and, in a minor degree, feodon, which increases the arch of the foot, and eodension, which flattens the arch. 6. Tarso-metatarsal Articulation.—The ligaments of this articula- tion are, Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous.157 METATARSO-PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS. The dorsal ligaments connect the metatarsal to the tarsal hones, and the metatarsal bones with each other. The precise arrangement of these ligaments is of little importance, but it may be remarked, that the base of the second metatarsal bone, articulating with the three cuneiform bones, receives a ligamentous slip from each, while the rest articulating with a single tai’sal bone receive only a single tarsal slip. The plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar surface. The interosseous ligaments are situated between the bases of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes ; and also between the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones and the internal and external cunei- form bones. The metatarsal bone of the second toe is implanted by its base between the internal and external cuneiform bones, and is the most strongly articulated of all the meta- tarsal bones. This disposition must be recollected in amputation at the tarso-meta- tarsal articulation. The synovial membranes of this articula- tion are three in number: one for the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe; one for the second and third metatarsal bones, which is continuous with the great tarsal synovial membrane; and one for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Actions.—The movements of the meta- tarsal bones upon the tarsal, and upon each other are very slight; they are such only as contribute to the strength of the foot, by permitting a certain degree of yielding to opposing forces. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal Articulation.— The ligaments of this articulation, like those of the articulation be- tween the first phalanges and metacarpal bones of the hand, are, * The ligaments of the sole of the foot. 1.

Anterior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The anterior or plantar ligaments are thick and fibro-cartilaginous, and form part of the articulating surface of the joint. The lateral ligaments are short and very strong, and situated on each side of the joints. The transverse ligaments are strong bands, which pass transversel}' between the anterior ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions.—The movements of the first phalanges upon the rounded heads of the metatarsal bones, are flexion, extension, adduction and abduetion, 8.

ON THE MUSCLES. ^Muscles are the moving organs of the animal frame ; they consti- tute by their size and nimiber the great bulk of the body, upon which they bestow form and symmetiy. In the limbs they are situated around the bones, which they invest and defend, while they form to some of the joints a principal protection. In the trunk they are spread out to enclose cavities, and constitute a defensive wall capable of yielding to internal pressure, and again returning to its original position. Them colour presents the deep red which is characteristic of flesh, and their form is variously modified, to execute the varied range of movements which they are required to effect. Muscle is composed of a munber of parallel fibres placed side by side, and supported and held together bj'' a delicate web of areolar tissue ; so that, if it were possible to remove the muscular substance, we should have remaining a beautiful reticular framework, possessing the exact form and size of the muscle withoiit its colour and solidit3% Towards the extremity of the organ the muscular fibre ceases, and the areolar structure becomes aggregated and modified, so as to constitute those glistening fibres and cords bj' which the muscle is tied to the surface of bone, and which are called tendons. Almost every muscle in the body is connected with bone, either by tendinous fibres, or by an aggregation of those fibres constituting a tendon ; and the union is so firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone itself rather breaks than permits of the separation of the tendon from its attachment. In the broad muscles the tendon is spread out so as to form an expan- sion, called aponeurosis {airo, longe ; nv^ov* nervus—a nerve widely spread out). Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement of their fibres in relation to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are completely longitudinal, and terminate at each extremity in tendon, the entire muscle being fusiform in its shape ; in other situations thej' are disposed like the rays of a fan, converging to a tendinous point, as the temporal, pectoral, glutei, &c., and constitute a radiate muscle. Again, they are penniform., converging like the plumes of a pen to one side of a tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle as in the peronei; or bipenniform, converging to both sides of • The ancients named all the white fibres of the body veupd; the term has since been limited to the nerves.160 STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. the tendon. In other muscles the fibres pass obliquely from the sur- face of a tendinous expansion spread out on one side, to that of another extended on the opposite side, as in the semi-membranosus ; or, they are composed of penniform or bipenniform fasciculi as in the deltoid, and constitute a compound muscle. The nomenclature of the muscles is defective and confused, and is generally derived from some prominent character which each muscle presents ; thus, some are named from their situation, as the tibialis, peroneus ; others from their uses, as the flexors, extensors, adductors, abductors, levators, tensors, &c. Some again from their form, as the trapezius, triangularis, deltoid, &c.; and others from their direction, as the rectus, obliquus, transversalis, &c. Certain muscles have re- ceived names expressive of their attachments, as the stemo-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, &c.; and others, of their divisions, as the biceps, triceps, digastricus, complexus, &c. In the description of a muscle we express its attachment by the words “ origin ” and “ insertion”; the term origin is generally applied to the more fixed or central attachment, or to the point towards which the motion is directed, while inseiiion is assigned to the more movable .. point, or to that most distant from the centre ; but there are many exceptions to this principle, and as many muscles pull equally towards both extremities, the use of such terms must be regarded as purelj’’ arbitrary. In structure, muscle is composed of bundles of fibres of variable size called fasciculi, Avhich are enclosed in an areolar membranous invest- ment or sheath, and the latter is continuous with the areolar frame- work of the fibres. Each fasciculus is composed of a number of smaller bundles, and these of single' fibres, which, from their minute size and independent appearance, have been distinguished b}”^ the name of ulti- ■ mate fibres. The ultimate fibre is found by microscopic investigation J to be itself a fasciculus (ultimate fasciculus), made up of a number of fi ultimate fibrils enclosed in a delicate sheath or myolemma.* Two | kinds of ultimate muscrilar fibre exist in the animal economy; viz., .

It also presents other markings or strife, having a longitudinal direction, which indicate the existence of fibrillfe within 1 * In the summer of 1836, while engaged with Dr. Jones Quainin the exami- nation of the animal tissues with a simple dissecting microscope, constructed by Powell, I first saw that the ultimate fibre of muscle was invested by a proper sheath, for which I proposed the term “ Myolemma a term which was adopt- ed by Dr. Quain in the fourth edition of his “ Elements of Anatomy.” We at that time believed that the transverse folding of that sheath gave rise to the ap- pearance of transverse stri®, an opinion which subsequent examinations proved to be incorrect. Mr. Bowman has since employed the tenn “ Sarcolemma,” as synonymous With Myolemma.161 STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. its myolemnia. The myolemma, or investing sheath of the ultimate fibre, is thin, structureless, and transparent. According to Mr. Bowman,* the ultimate fibres are polyhedral in shape [fig. 79] from mutual pres- sure. They are also variable in their size, not merelj' in dift'erent classes and genera of animals, and different sexes, but even in the same muscle. For example, the average diameter of the ultimate fibre in the human female is while that of the male is 3^, the average of both being, in round numbers, The largest fibres are met with in fishes, in which animals they averagethe next largest are found in man; while in other classes they range in the following order;— insects -^rrs ! reptiles ; mammalia ; birds The vUimate fibrils of animal life, according to Mr. Bowman, are beaded filaments consisting of a regular succession of segments and constrictions, the latter being narrower than the former, and the com- ponent substance probably less dense. An ultimate fibre consists of a bundle of these fibrils, which are so disposed that all the segments and all the constrictions correspond, and in this manner give rise to the alternate light and dark lines of the transverse striae. The fibrils are connected together with very different degrees of closeness in different animals ; in man they are but slightly adherent, and distinct longitudinal lines of junction may be observed between them ; they also separate very easily when ma- cerated for some time. Besides the more usual separation of the ultimate fibre into fibrils, it breaks when stretched, into transverse segments [fig. 80], corresponding with the dark lines of the striae, and consequently with the constric- tions of the fibrillae. When this I division occurs with the greatest ' facility, the longitudinal lines are indistinct, or scarcely perceptible. • On the Minute structure and Movements of Voluntary Muscle. By Wm.

Fig. 80.iSTRI'CTURE OF MUSCLE. 1G2 “ In fact,” says Mr. Bowman, “ the primitive fasciculus seems to con- sist of primitive component segments or particles, arranged so as to form, in one sense, fihrillm, and in another sense, discs ; and which of these two may happen to present itself to the observer, will depend on the amount of adhesion, endways or sideways, existing between the segments. Generally, in a recdnt fasciculus, there are transverse striffi, shewing divisions into discs, and longitudinal striae, marking its composition by fibrillae.” Mr. Bomnan has observed that in the substance of the ultimate fibre there exist minute “ oval or circular discs, frequently concave on one or both surfaces, and containing, somewhere near the centre, one, two, or three minute dots or granules.” Occasionally they are seen to present irregularities of form, which Mr. Bowman is inclined4o regard as accidental. They are situated between and are connected with the fibrils, and are distributed in pretty equal numbers through the fibre. These corpuscles are the nuclei of the nucleated cells out of which the muscular fibre was originally developed.

It measures in diameter of an inch, and is composed of a succession of cells connected by their flat sur- faces. The cells are filled with a transparent substance, which I have termed myoline. The myoline differs in density in different cells, and from this circumstance bestows a peculiarity of character on certain of the cells. For example, when a fibril in its passive state is examined, there will be seen a series of dark oblong bodies separated by light spaces of equal length ; now, the dark bodies are each composed of a pair of cells containing the densest form of myoline, and are hence * Mass of ultimate fibres from the pectoralis major of the human foetus, at nine months.

When the ultimate fibril is very much stretched, the two highly refrac- tive cells appear each to be double; while the transparent space is evidently composed of four cells. ultimate fibre of organic life [fig. 83, D, e] is a simple homogeneous fila- ment, much smaller than the fibre of animal life, flat, and without transverse markings. Besides these characters, there may generally be seen a dark line or several dark points in its in- terior, and not unfrequently the entire fibre appears enlarged at irregidar distances. These appearances are due to the presence of the unobli- terated nuclei of cells from which the fibre was originally developed. The fibres of organic life are collected into fasciculi of various size and 82.* EB are held together by dark nuclear fibres similar to those which bind the fasciculi of fibrous tissue (p, 115). The development of muscular fibre is eflfected by means of the formation of nucleated cells out of an original blastema, and the con- version of those cells, by a process already described (p. 5) into the tubuli of ultimate fibres, while their contents, by a subsequent de- velopmental action, are transformed into ultimate fibrils.

The disposition of these latter cells, in the production of fibrillae, is probably much more simple than has hitherto been conceived. In Fig.SS* the muscular fibre of organic life the process would seem to stop short of the formation of fibrillas, the cells being accumulated wdth- out apparent order. The corpuscles, observed by Mr. Bowman, in foetal muscle [fig. 81] and the nodosities of organic fibre, are obviously undeveloped cells and nuclei. Muscles are divided into two great classes, voluntarj' and involun- tary, to which may be added, as an intermediate and connecting link, the muscle of the vascular system, the heart. The voluntary^ or system of animal life, is developed firom the ex- ternal or serous layer of the germinal membrane, and comprehends the whole of the muscles of the limbs and of the trunk. The involuntary, or organic system, is developed from the internal or mucous layer, and constitutes the thin muscular structure of the intestinal canal, bladder, and internal organs of generation. At the commencement of the ali- mentary canal in the oesophagus, and near its termination in the rectum, the muscular coat is formed by a blending of the fibres of both classes. The heart is developed from the middle, or vascular layer of the germinal membrane; and, although involuntarj- in its action, is * A.

JMuscles of the Head and Face.—These muscles may be divided into groups corresponding with the natural regions of the head and face ; the groups are eight in number, viz.— 1. Cranial group. 2. Orbital group. 3. Ocular group. 4. Nasal group. 5. 6. 7. 8. Superior labial group. Inferior labial group^ Maxillary group. Auricular group.

Cranial group.—Occipito-frontalis. Dissection.—occipito-frontalis is to be dissected by making a longitudinal incision along the vertex of the head, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the root of the nose ; and a second incision along the forehead and around the side of the head, to join the two extremities of the preceding. Dissect the integument and superficial fascia carefully outwards, beginning at the anterior angle of the flap, where the muscular fibres are thickest, and remove it altogether.

This dissection requires care; for the muscle is very thin, and without attention would be raised with the integument. There is no deep fascia on the face and head, nor is it required; for here the muscles are closely applied against the bones, upon which they depend for support, whilst in the extremities the support is derived from the dense layer of fascia by which they are invested, and which forms for each a dis- tinct sheath. The OcciPiTO-FRONTALis is a broad musculo-aponeurotic layer, which covers the whole of the side of the vertex of the skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It arises by tendinous fibres from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Its insertion takes place by means of the blending of the fibres of its anterior portion with those of the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, levator labii supe- rioris alaeque nasi, and pyramidalis nasi. The muscle is fleshy in front over the frontal bone and behind over tlie occipital, the two por- tions being connected by a broad aponeurosis. The two muscles together with their aponeurosis cover the whole of the vertex of the skull, hence their designation galea capitis; they are loosely adherent to the pericranium, but very closely to the integument, particularly over the forehead. Relations.—This muscle is in relation by its external surface from before backwards, with the frontal and supra-orbital vessels, the supra-orbitiil and facial nerve, the temporal vessels and nerve, the occipital vessels and nerves, and with the integument, to which it is very closely adherent. Its under surface is attached to the peri- cranium by a loose areolar tissue which admits of considerable move- ment. Action.—To raise the eyebrows, thereby throwing the integument of the forehead into transverse wrinkles. Some persons have the power of moving the entire scalp upon the pericranium by means of these muscles, 2. Orbital group.—Orbicularis palpebrarum, Cornigator supercilii. Tensor tarsi. Dissection.—The dissection of the face is to be effected by con- tinuing the longitudinal incision of the vertex of the previous dissec- tion onwards to the tip of the nose, and thence downwards to the margin of the upper lip; then carry an incision along the margin of the lip to the angle of the mouth, and transversely across the face to the angle of the lower-jaw. Lastly, divide the integument in front of the external ear upwards to the transverse incision which was made for exposing the occipito-frontalis. Dissect the integument and super- ficial fascia carefully from the whole of the region included by tlieso incisions, and the present with the two following groups of muscles will be brought into view. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum is a sphincter muscle, surround-168 ORBICULAKIS PALPEBRARUM. ing the orbit and eyelids. It arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and from a short tendon (pmdo oculi) which extends between the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and the inner extremities of the tarsal cartilages of the eyelids. The fibres encircle the orbit and e}'^elid8, forming a broad and thin muscular plane, which is inserted into the lower border of the tendo oculi and into the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Upon the eyelids the fibres are thin and pale, and possess an involuntary action. The tendo oculi, in ad- dition to its insertion into the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, sends a process inwards which expands over the lachrymal sac, and is attached to the ridge of the lachrymal bone : this is the reflect- ed aponeurosis of the tendo oculi. Relations.—By its su'perjicial surface it is closely adherent to the integument from which it is separated over the eyelids b}’’ a loose areolar tissue. By its deep surface, it lies in contact above with the upper border of the orbit, with the corrugator supercilii muscle, and with the frontal and supra-orbital vessels and supra-orbital neiwe ; lieloiv, with the lachrymal sac, ivith the origins of the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, levator labii superioris proprius, zygomaticus major and minor muscles, and malar bone; and externally with the temporal fascia. Upon the e3’^elids it is in relation with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal cartilages, and by its upper border gives at- tachment to the occipito-frontalis muscle. The Corrugator Supercilii is a small narrow and pointed muscle, situated immediatelj’' above the orbit and beneath the upper segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. It arises from the inner extremity of the superciliarj'^ ridge, and is inserted into the under surface of the orbicularis palpebrarum at a point corresponding with the middle of the superciliary arch. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the pyi-amidalis nasi, occipito-frontalis and orbicularis palpebrarum muscle; and by its deep surface, with the supra-orbital vessels and nerve. The Tensor Tarsi (Horner’smuscle) is a thin plane of muscular fibres, about three lines in breadth and six in length. It is best dis- sected by separating the eyelids from the eye, and turning them over the nose without disturbing the tendo oculi; then dissect away the small fold of mucous membrane called plica semilunaris, and some loose areolar tissue under ivhich the muscle is concealed. It arises from the orbital surface of the lachrj^mal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac divides into two slips, which are inserted into the lachrj'mal canals as far as the puncta. Actions.—The palpebral portion of the orbicularis acts involuntarily in closing the lids, and from the greater curve of the upper lid, upon that principally. The entire muscle acts as a sphincter, drawing at * W. E. Horner, M.D. Professor of Anatomy in the University of Pennsyl- vania. The notice of this muscle is contained in a work published in Philadel- phia in 1827, entitled “ Lessons in Practical Anatomy.”169 OCULAR GROUP. the same time, by means of its osseous attachment, the integument and lids inwards towards the nose. The corrugatores superciliorum draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards, and produce the vertical wrinkles of the forehead. The tensor tarsi, or lachrymal muscle, draws the extremities of the lachrjTiial canals inwards, so as to place the puncta in the best position for receiving the tears. It serves also to keep the lids in relation with the surface of the eye, and compresses the lachrymal sac. Dr. Homer is acquainted with two persons who have the voluntary power of drawing the lids inwards by these muscles so as to bury the pimcta in the angle of the eye. 3. Ocular group.—Levator palpebrae. Rectus superior. Rectus inferior. Rectus internus. Rectus externus, Obliquus superior, Obliquus inferior. Dissection.—To open the orbit (the calvarium and brain having been removed) the frontal bone must be sawn through at the inner extremity of the orbital ridge ; and, externally, at its outer extremity. The roof of the orbit may then be comminuted by a few light blows with the hammer; a process easily accomplished, on account of the Fig. 85.* * The muscles of the eyeball; the view is taken from the outer side of the right orbit. 1.

The superciliary portion of the orbit may now be driven forwards by a smart blow, and the external angular process and ex- ternal wall of the orbit outwards in the same manner; the broken fragments of the roof of the orbit should then be removed. By this means the periosteum will be exposed unbroken and undisturbed. Remove the periosteum from the Whole of the upper surface of the exposed orbit, and examine the parts beneath. The Levator Palpebr^e is a long, thin, and triangular muscle ; situated in the upper part of the orbit on the middle line; it arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve, and is inserted into the upper border of the superior tarsal cartilage. Relatio7is.—By its ujrper surface with the fourth nerve, the supra- orbital nerve and artery, the periosteum of the orbit, and in front with the inner surface of the broad tarsal ligament. By its under surface it rests upon the superior rectus muscle, and the globe of the eye; it receives its nerve and artery by this aspect, and in front is covered for a short distance by the conjunctiva. The Rectus Superior (attollens) arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve, and in inserted into the upper surface of the globe of the eye at a point somewhat more than three lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its upper surface Avith the levator palpebrre muscle ; by the under surface with the optic nerve, the ophthahnic artery and nasal nerve, from which it is separated by a layer of fascia and by the adipose tissue of the orbit, and in front with the globe of the eye, the tendon of the superior oblique muscle being interposed. The Rectus Inferior (depressor) arises from the inferior margin of the optic foramen by a tendon (ligament of Zinn) Avhich is common to it, the internal and the external rectus, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; it is inserted into the inferior surface of the globe of the eye at a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea.

By its outer surface with the pe- riosteum of the orbit; and by its upper border Avith the anterior and posterior ethmoidal vessels, the nasal, and supra-trochlear nerve.OCULAR GROUP. 171 The Rectus Externus (abductor), the longest of the straight muscles, arises by two distinct heads, one from the common tendon, the other with the origin of the superior rectus from the margin of the optic foramen; the nasal, third, and sixth nerves passing between its heads. It is inserted into the outer surface of the globe of the eye at a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—Bj' its internal surface with the third, the nasal, the sixth, and the optic nerve, the ciliary ganglion and nerves, the oph- thalmic artery and vein, the adipose tissue of the orbit, the inferior oblique muscle, and the eyeball. By its external surface with the pe- riosteum of the orbit; and by the uj^per border with the lachrymal vessels and nerr'e and the lachrymal gland. The recti muscles present several characters which are common to all; thus, they are thin, have each the form of an isosceles triangle, bear’ the same relation to the globe of the eye, and are inserted in a similar manner into the sclerotica, at about two lines from the circum- ference of the cornea. The points of difference relate to thickness and length; the internal rectus is the thickest and shortest, the external rectus the longest of the four, and the superior rectus the most thin. The insertion of the four recti muscles into the globe of the eye forms a tendinous expansion, which is continued as far as the margin of the cornea, and is called the tunica albuginea. The Obliquus Superior (trochleaids) is a fusiform muscle arising from the margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; it passes forwards to the pulley beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone; its tendon is then reflected be- neath the superior rectus muscle, to the outer and posterior part of the globe of the eye, where it is inserted into the sclerotic coat, near the entrance of the optic nerve. The tendon is surrounded by a synovial membrane, while passing through the cartilaginous pulley. Relations.—By its superior surface with the fourth nerve, the supra- trochlear nerve, and with the periosteum of the orbit. By the in- ferior surface with the adipose tissue of the orbit, the upper border of the internal rectus and the vessels and nerves in relation with that border. The Obliquus Inferior, a thin and narrow muscle, arises from the inner margin of the superior maxillary bone, immediately external to the lachrymal groove, and passes beneath the inferior rectus, to be inserted into the outer and posterior part of the eyeball, at about two lines from the entrance of the optic nerve. Relations.—By its superior surface with the inferior rectus muscle and with the eyeball; and by the inferior surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orbit, and the external rectus muscle. According to Mr. Ferrall" the muscles of the orbit are separated from the globe of the eyeball and from the structures immediately surrounding the optic nerve, by a distinct fascia, which is continuous * In a paper read before the Royal Society, on the 10th of June, 1841.172 NASAL GROUP. with the broad tarsal ligament and with the tarsal cartilages. This fascia the author tei’ms, the tunica vaginalis oculi* it is pierced ante- riorly for the passage of the six orbital muscles, by six openings through which the tendons of the muscles play as through pulle;ys. The use assigned to it by Mr. Ferrall is to protect the eyeball from the pressure of its muscles during their action. By means of this structure the recti muscles are enabled to impress a rotatory movement upon the ej'eball; and in animals provided with a retractor muscle, they also serve as antagonists to its action. Actions.—The levator palpebrae raises the upper eyelid. The four recti, acting singly, pull the eyeball in the four directions; upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards. Acting by pairs, they carry the eyeball in the diagonal of these directions, viz. upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and inwards, or do^vnwards and outwards. Acting all together, they directly retract the globe within the orbit. The superior oblique muscle, acting alone, rolls the globe inwards and forwards, and carries the pupil outwards and downwards to the lower and outer angle of the orbit. The inferior oblique acting alone, rolls the globe outwards and backwards, and carries the pupU outwards and upwards to the upper and outer angle of the eye. Both muscles acting together, draw the eyeball forwards, and give the pupil that slight degree of eversion which enables it to admit the largest field of vision. 4. Nasal Group.—Pyramidalis nasi. Compressor nasi. Dilatator naris. The Pyramidalis Nasi is a small pyramidal slip of muscular fibres sent downwards upon the bridge of the nose by the occipito- frontalis. It is inserted into the tendinous expansion of the compres- sores nasi. Relations.—By its upper surface with the integument; by its under surface with the periosteum of the frontal and nasal bone. Its outer border corresponds with the edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and its mner border with its fellow, from which it is separated by a slight interval. The Compressor Nasi is a thin and triangular muscle ; it arises by its apex from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and spreads out upon the side of the nose into a thin tendinous expansion, which is continuous across its ridge with the muscle of the opposite side. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator labii supe- rioris proprius, the levator labii super!oris alaeque nasi, and the inte- gument; by its deep surface with the superior maxillary and nasal bone, and with the alar and lateral cartilages of the nose. • This fascia was first described by Mr. Dalrymple in his work on the “ Ana- tomy of the Human Eye.” 1834.173 SUPERIOR LABIAL GROUP. The Dilatator Naris is a thin and indistinct muscular apparatus expiuided upon the ala of the nostril, and consisting of an anterior and a posterior slip. The anterior slip (levator proprius alaa nasi anterior) extends between the lateral and the alar cartilage at about midway between the tip and the attached margin of the nose. The posterior slip (levator proprius alse nasi posterior) is attached above to the margin of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and below to the small cartilages of the ala nasi. These muscles are difficult of dissection, from the close adhesion of the integument to the nasal car- tilages. Actions.—The p}"ramidalis nasi, as a point of attachment of the occipito-frontalis, assists that muscle in its action : it also draws down the inner angle of the eyebrow, and by its insertion fixes the aponeu- rosis of the compressores nasi. The compressores nasi appear to act in expanding rather than in compressing the nares ; hence probably the compressed state of the nares from paralysis of these muscles in the last moments of life, or in compression of the brain. The use of the dilatator naris is expressed in its name. 5. Superior Labial Group.—Orbicularis oris. Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. Levator labii superioris proprius. Levator anguli oris, Zygomaticus major, Zygomaticus minor. Depressor labii superioris alseque nasi. The Orbicularis Oris is a sphincter muscle, completely surround- ing the mouth, and possessing consequently neither origin nor inser- tion. It is composed of two thick semicircular planes of fibres, which embrace the rima of the mouth, and interlace at their extremities, where they are continuous with the fibres of the buccinator, and of the other muscles connected with the angle of the mouth. The upper segment is attached by means of a small muscular fasciculus (naso- labialis) to the columna of the nose ; and other fasciculi connected with both segments, and attached to the maxillary bones, are termed “ accessorii.” Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument of the lips, with which it is closely connected. By its deep surface with the mucous membrane of the mouth, the labial glands and coronary arte- ries being interposed- By its circumference with the numerous mus- cles which move the lips, and by the inner border with the mucous membrane of the rima of the mouth. The Levator Labii Superioris ALiEQUE Nasi is a thin trian- gular muscle ; it arises from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone ; and, becoming broader as it descends, is in- serted by two distinct portions into the ala of the nose and upper lip. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a part of the orbicularis174 LEVATOR LABll SUPERIORIS. palpebrarum muscle, the facial arterj', and the integument. By its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone, compressor nasi, alar cartilage, and with a muscular fasciculus attached only to the bone, and thence called musculus anomalus. The Levator Labii Supeiuoris Proprius is a thin quadrilateral muscle: it arises from the lower border of the orbit, and passing ob- liquely downwards and inwards, is inserted into the integument of the upper lip, its deep fibres being blended with those of the orbicularis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum, with the facial artery, and with the integu- ment. By its deep surface with the origins of the compressor nasi and levator anguli oris muscle, and with the infra-orbital artery and nerve. The Levator Anguli Oris arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and passes outwards to be inserted into the angle of the mouth, intermingling its fibres with those of the orbicu- laris, zygomatici, and depressor anguli oris. Relations.—By its sujoerficial surface with the levator labii supe- rioris proprius, the branches of the infra-orbital arter}' and nerve, and interiorly with the integument. Bj"^ its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone and buccinator muscle. The Zygomatic muscles are two slender fasciculi of fibres which arise from the malar bone, and are inseided into the angle of the mouth, where they are continuous with the other muscles attached to this part. The zygomaticus minor is situated in front of the major, and is continuous at its insertion "with the levator labii superioris proprius ; it is not unfrequently wanting. Relations.—The zygomaticus major muscle is in relation by its super- ficial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum above, and the fat of the cheek and integument for the rest of its ex- tent. By its deep surface with the malar bone, the masseter, and buc- cinator muscle, and the facial vessels. The zygomaticus minor being in front of the major, has no relation with the masseter muscle, while inferiorly it rests upon the levator anguli oris. The Depressor Labii Superioris Al.$que Nasi (myrtiformis) is seen b}”^ drawing upwards the upper lip, and raising the mucous membrane. It is a small oval slip of muscle, situated on each side of the fii’senum, arising from the incisive fossa, and passing upwards to be inserted into the upper lip, and into the ala and coliunna of the nose. This muscle is continuous by its outer border with the edge of the compressor nasi. Relations.—its superficial surface with the mucous membrane of the mouth, the orbicularis oris and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle; and by its deep surface with the superior maxillary' bone. Actions.—The orbicularis oris produces the direct closure of the lips by means of its continuity, at the angles of the mouth, with the fibres of the buccinator. When acting singly in the forcible closure of the mouth, the integument is thrown into wrinkles, in consequence of its firm connection with the surface of the muscle. The levator labii175 INFERIOR LABIAL GROUP. superioris alieque nasi lifts tlie upper lip with tlie ala of the nose, and expands the opening of the nares. The depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi is the antagonist to this muscle, drawing the upper lip and ala of the nose downwards, and contracting the opening of the nares. The levator labii superioris proprius is the proper elevator of the upper lip ; acting singly, it draws the lip a little to one side. The levator anguli oris lifts the angle of the mouth and draws it inwards, while the zygomatic! pull it upwards and outwards, as in laughing. 6. Inferior Labial Group.—Depressor labii inferioris, Depressor angidi oris, Levator labii inferioris. Dissection.—To dissect the inferior labial region, continue the vertical section from the margin of the lower lip to the point of the chin. Then carry an incision along the margin of the lower jaw to its angle. Dissect olf the integument and superficial fascia from the whole of this surface, and the muscles of the inferior labial region will be exposed. The Depressor labu inferioris (quadratus menti) arises from the oblique line by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and passing upwards and inwards, is inserted into the orbicularis muscle and integument of the lower lip. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the platysma myoides, part of the depressor anguli oris, and with the integument of the chin with which it is closely connected. By the deep surface with the le- vator labii inferioris, the labial glands and mucous membrane of the lower lip, and with the mental nerve and artery. The Depressor anguli oris (triangularis oris) is a triangular plane of muscle aiising b}’' a broad base from the external oblique ridge of the lower jaw, and mserted by its apex into the angle of the mouth, where it is continuous with the levator anguli oris and zygo- maticus major. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument ; and by its deep surface with the depressor labii inferioris, the buccinator, and the branches of the mental nerve and artery. The Levator labii inferioris (levator menti) is a small conical slip of muscle arising from the incisive fossa of the lower jaw, and in- serted into the integument of the chin. It is in relation with the mu- cous membrane of the mouth, with its fellow, and with the depressor labii inferioris. Actions.—The depressor labii inferioris draws the lower lip directly downwards, and at the same time a little outwards. The depressor anguli oris, from the radiated direction of its fibres, will pull the angle of the mouth either downwards and inwards, or downwards and out- wards, and be expressive of grief; or acting with the levator anguli oris and zygomaticus major, it will draw the angle of the mouth directly backwards. The levator labii inferioris raises and protrudes the integument of the chin.17G MAXILLARY GROUP. 7. Maxillary Group,—Masseter, Temporalis, Buccinator, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. Dissection.—The masseter has been already exposed by the preced- ing dissection. The Masseter {fjt,ct(T(riioy,a.i, to chew,) is a short, thick, and some- what quadrilateral muscle, composed of two planes of fibres, super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer arises by a strong aponeurosis from the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, the lower border of the malar bone and the zygoma, and passes backwards to be insei ted into the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. The deep layer arises from the posterior part of the zygoma, and passes forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus. This muscle is tendinous and muscular in its structure. Relations.—By its external surface with the zygomaticus major and risorius Santorini muscle, the parotid gland and Stenon’s duct, the transverse facial artery, the pes anserinus and the integument. By its internal surface with the temporal muscle, the buccinator, from which it is separated by a mass of fat, and with the ramus of the lower jaw. By its posterior border with the parotid gland; and by the anterior border with the facial artery and vein. Dissection.— Make an incision along the upper border of the z}^goma, for the purpose of separating the temporal fascia from its attachment. Then saw through the zy^gomatic process of the malar bone, and through the root of the zj’^goma, near to the meatus audi- torius. Draw do\vn the zygoma, and with it the origin of the mas- seter, and dissect the latter muscle away from the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. Now remove the temporal fascia from the rest of its attachment, and the whole of the temporal muscle will be exposed. The Temporal is a broad and radiating muscle occupying a consi- derable extent of the side of the head, and filling the temporal fossa. It is covered in by a very dense fascia (temporal fascia), which is attached along the temporal ridge on the side of the skull, extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the mastoid por- tion of the temporal; and inferiorly it is connected to the upper border of the zygoma. The muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the whole length of the temporal ridge, and by muscular fibres from the temporal fascia and entire surface of the temporal fossa. Its fibres converge to a strong and narrow tendon, which is inserted into tlie apex of the coronoid process, and for some way down upon its inner surface. Relations.—By its external surface with the temporal fascia (which separates it from the attollens and attrahens aureni muscle, and the temporal vessels and nerves) and with the zygoma and masseter. By its internal surface with the bones forming the temporal fossa, the exter-177 BUCCINATOR.—PTERYGOIDEI. nal pterygoid muscle, a part of the huccinator, and the internal maxil- lary artery with its deep temporal branches. By sawing through the coronoid process near its base, and pulling it upwards, together with the temporal muscle, wliich may be dissected from the fossa, we obtain a view of the entire extent of the buccinator and of the external pterygoid muscle. The Buccinator {biKcina, a trumpet) the trumpeter’s muscle, arises from the alveolar process of the superior maxillaiy bone, from the ex- temal oblique line of the inferior maxillary bone, as far forward as the second bicuspid tooth, and from the pterygo-maxillary ligament. This ligament is the raphe of union between the buccinator and supe- rior constrictor muscle, and is attached by one extremity to the harnu- lar process of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the extremity of the molar ridge. The fibres of the muscle converge to- wards the angle of the mouth where they cross each other, the supe- rior being continuous with the inferior segment of the orbicularis oris, and the inferior with the superior segment. The muscle is invested externally by a thin fascia. ■Relations.—By its eaiernal surface, posteriorly, with a large and rounded mass of fat, which separates the muscle from the ramus of the lower jaw, the temporal, and the masseter ; anteriorly with the risorius Santorini, the zygomatici, the levator angiili oris, and the depressor anguli oris. It is also in relation with a part of Stenon’s duct, (which pierces it opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw,) with the transverse facial artery, the branches of the facial and buccal nerve, and the facial artery and vein. By its internal surface with the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth. The External pterygoid is a short and thick muscle, broader at its origin than at its insertion. It arises by two heads, one from the pterj'goid ridge on the greater ala of the sphenoid ; the other from the external pterygoid plate and tuberosity of the palate bone. The fibres pass backwards to be inserted into the neck of the lower jaw and the interarticular fibro-cartilage. The internal maxillary artery fi:equently passes between the two heads of this muscle. Relations.—By its external surface with the ramus of the lower jaw, the temporal muscle, and the internal maxillarj'' artery; by its internal surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, arteria meningea media, and inferior maxillary nerve ; and by its upper border with the muscular branches of the inferior maxillarj' nerve; the internal maxillary artery passes between the two heads of this muscle, and its lower origin is pierced by the buccal nerve. The external pterj-goid muscle must now be removed, the ramus of the lower jaw sawn through its lower third, and the head of the bone dislocated from its socket and withdrawn, for the purpose of seeing the pterygoideus intemus. The Internal pterygoid is a thick quadrangular niuscle. It arises from the ptcrj'goid fossa and descends obliquely backwards, to be inserted into the ramus and angle of the lower jaw ; it resembles N178 AURICULAR GROUP. the masseter in appearance and direction, and was named by Winslow the internal masseter. ReLutions.—By its external surface with the external pterygoid, the interior maxillary nerve and its branches, the internal maxillary artery and branches, the internal lateral ligament, and the ramus of the lower jaw. By its internal surface with the tensor palati, superior con- strictor and fascia of the pharynx ; and by its posterior border with the parotid gland. Fig. 86.» Actions.—The maxillary muscles are the active agents in mastica- tion, and form an apparatus beautifully fitted for that office. The buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of the tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connection with the superior constrictor, it shortens the cavity of the pharjTix, from before backwards, and becomes an im- portant auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal pterygoid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterj'goid in grinding the food by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the upper; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temporal. The whole of these muscles, acting in succession, pro- duce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the_upper, effects the proper mastication of the food. 8. Auricular Group.—Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Retrahens aurem. • The two pterj'goid muscles. The zygomatic arch and the gi-eater part of the ramus of the lower jaw have been removed in order to bring these muscles into view. 1. The sphenoid origin of the external pterygoid muscle. 2. Its pterygoid origin. 3. The internal pterygoid muscle.MUSCLES OP THE NECK. 179 Dissectioji.—The three small muscles of the ear may be .exposed by removing a square of integument from around the auricula. This operation must be performed with care, otherwise the muscles, which are extremely thin, will be raised Avith the superficial fascia. They are best dissected by commencing with their tendons, and thence pro- ceeding in the course of their radiating fibres. The Attollens aurem (superior auris), the largest of the three, is a thin triangular plane of muscular fibres arising from the edge of the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, and inserted into the upper part of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal with the temporal aponeurosis. The Attrahens aurem (anterior auris), also triangular, arises from the edge of the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, and is in- serted into the anterior part of the helix, covering in the anterior and posterior temporal arteries. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument; and by the internal with the temporal aponeurosis and with the temporal artery and veins. The Retrahens aurem (posterior auris), ai-ises by three or four muscular slips from the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Actions.—The muscles of the auricular region possess but little action in man; they are the analogues of important muscles in brutes. Their use is sufficiently explained in their names. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups corres- ponding with the natural divisions of the region ; they are the— 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and l.arynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Soft palate group. 7. Praevertebral group. 8. Proper muscles of the larynx. And each of these groups consists of the following muscles :—viz. 1. Superficial G-roup. Platysma myoides, Stemo-cleido-mastoideus. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus.180 PLATVSMA MYOIDES, 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoideus, . Genio-hyo-glossus. 4. Muscles of the Tongue. Genio-hyd-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Lingualis, St}do-glossus, Palato-glossus. 5. Muscles of the Pharynx. Constrictor inferior, Constrictor medius, Constrictor superior, Stylo-pharj'Ugeus, Palato-pharyngeus. 6. Muscles of the soft Palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati. Azygos uvulae, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. 7. PrcBvertebral Group. Rectus anticus major. Rectus anticus minor. Scalenus anticus. Scalenus posticus, Longus colli. 8. Muscles of the Larynx. Crico-thyroideus, Crico-arytaenoideus, posticus, Crico-arytaenoideus, lateralis, Thju'o-arj’^taenoideus, Arytaenoideus. Dissection,—The dissection of the neck should be commenced by making an incision along the middle line of its fore part from the chin to the sternum, and bounding it superior!}' and inferiorly by two transverse incisions ; the superior one being carried along the margm of the lower jaw, and across the mastoid process to the tubercle on the occipital bone, the inferior one along the clavicle to the acromion pro- cess. The square flap of integument thus included should be turned back from the entire side of the neck, which brings into view the superficial fascia, and on the removal of a thin laj'er of superficial fascia the platysma myoides will be exposed. The Platysma myoides (wAaTy?, /Tv; broad muscle-like la- mella), is a thin plane of muscular fibres, situated between the two layers of the superficial cervical fascia ; it arises from the integument over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles, and passes obliquely upwards and inwards along the side of the neck to be inserted into the side of the chin, oblique line of the lower jaw, the angle of the mouth, and into the areolar tissue of the face. The most anterior fibres are continuous beneath the chin, with the muscle of the opposite side ; the next interlace with the depressor anguli oris, and depressor lahii inferioris, and the most posterior fibres are disposed in a transverse direction across the side of the face, arising in the areolar tissue covering the parotid gland, and inserted into the angle of the mouth, constituting the risorius Santorini. The entire muscle is analogous to the cutaneous muscle of brutes, the panniculus carnosus. Pelations.—By its exter7ial surface with the integument, Muth which it is closely adherent below, but loosely above. By its internal surface.STERNO-CLEIDO-AIASTOIDEUS. 181 below the clavicle, with the pectoralis major and deltoid; in the neck with the external jugular vein and deep cervical fascia; on the face, with the parotid gland, the masseter, the facial artery and vein, the buccinator, the depressor angiili oris, and the depressor labii in- ferioris. On raising the platj’sma throughout its whole extent, the stemo- ’ mastoid is brought into view. Fig 8T* The Sterno-cleido-mastoideus is the large oblique muscle of the neck, and is situated between two layers of the deep cervical fascia. It arises as implied by its name from the sternum and clavicle (*a=<S;i31'), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted * The muscles of the anterior aspect of the neck ; on the right side of the figure the superficial muscles are seen, and on the left the deep. 1.

The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a consi- derable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, and separate from the sternal portion below, but becomes gra- dually blended with the posterior surface of the latter as it ascends. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument, the pla- tysma myoides, the external jugular vein, superficial branches of the anterior cervical plexus of nerves, and the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. By its deep surface with the deep layer of the cervical fascia ; with the sterno-clavicular articulation, the stemo-lij’’oid, sterno- thyroid, omo-hyoid, scaleni, levator anguli scapulae, splenii, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle; with the phrenic nerve, and the posterior-scapular and supra-scapular artery ; with the deep Ijnnphatic glands, the sheath of the common carotid and internal jugular vein, the descendens noni nerve, the external carotid artery and its posterior branches, the commencement of the internal carotid artery ; with the cervical plexus of nerves, the pneumogastric, the spinal accessorj% the hj^oglossal, the sympathetic and the facial nerve, and with the parotid gland. It is pierced on this aspect by the spinal accessory nerve and liy the branches of the mastoid artery. The anterior border of the muscle is the posterior boundary of the great anterior triangle, the other two boundaries being the middle line of the neck in front, and the lower border of the jaw above. It is the guide to the operations for the ligature of the common carotid artery and arteria innominata, and for (Esophagotomy. The posterior border is the anterior boundary of the great posterior triangle; the other two boundaries being the anterior border of the trapezius behind, and the clavicle below. Actions.—The platysma produces a muscular traction on the integu- ment of the neck, which prevents it from falling so flaccid in old persons as would be the case if the extension of the skin were the mere result of elasticity. It draws also upon the angle of the mouth, and is one of the depressors of the lower jaw. The transverse fibres draw the angle of the mouth outwards and slightly upwards. The sterno- mastoid muscles are the great anterior muscles of connection between the thorax and the head. Both muscles acting together bow the head directly forwards. The clavicular portions, acting more forcibly than the sternal, give stability and steadiness to the head in supporting great weights. Either muscle acting singly would draw the head towards the shoulder of the same side, and carry the face towards the opposite side. Second Group.—Depressors of the Os Hyoides and Larynx, Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Thyro-hyoid, Omo-hyoid. Dissection.—These muscles are brought into view by removing the183 STERNO-IIYOIDEUS.—OMO-HYOIDEUS. deep fascia from off the front of the neck between the two sterno- mastoid muscles. The omo-hyoid to he seen in its whole extent re- quires that the stemo-mastoid muscle shoidd be divided from its origin and turned aside. The Stern’o-hyoideus, is a narrow riband-like muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum and from the inner extremity of the clavicle. It is inserted into the lower bor- der and posterior surface of the body of the os hyoides. The sterno- hyoidei are separated by a considerable interval at the root of the neck, but approach each other as they ascend ; they are frequently traversed by a tendinous intersection. Relations.—By its external stirface with the deep cervical fascia, the platysma myoides and stemo-mastoid muscle; by its internal surface with the stemo-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid muscle, and the superior thyroid artery. The Sterno-thyroideus, broader than the preceding beneath which it lies, arises from the posterior surface of the upper bone of the sternum, and from the cartilage of the first rib ; it is inserted into the oblique line on the great ala of the thyroid cartilage. The inner borders of these muscles lie in contact along the middle line; they are generally marked by a tendinous intersection at their lower part. Relations.—By its external surface with the sterno-hyoid, omo- h)'oid, and sterno-mastoid muscle; by its internal surface, with the trachea and inferior thyroid veins, with the thyroid gland, the lower part of the larj'nx, the sheath of the common carotid artery and inter- nal jugular vein, with the subclavian vein and vena innominata, and on the right side with the arteria innominata. The middle thyroid vein lies along its inner border. The Thyro-hyoideus is the continuation upwards of the stemo- thyroid muscle. It arises from the oblique line on the thyroid carti- lage, and is inserted into the lower border of the body and great cornu of the os hyoides. Relations.—By its external surface with the sterno-hyoid and omo- hyoid muscle; by its internal surface with the great ala of the thyroid cartilage, the thyro-hyoidean membrane, and the superior laryngeal artery and nerve. The Omohyoideus {Zgn, shoulder) is a - double-bellied muscle passing obliquely across the neck from the scapula to the os-hyoides ; it forms an obtuse angle behind the stemo-mastoid muscle, and is retained in that position by means of a process of the deep cervical fascia which is connected to the inner border of its tendon. It arises firom the upper border of the scapula, and from the transverse liga- ment of the supra-scapular notch, and is inserted into the lower border of the body of the os-hyoides. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, the sub- clavius and clavicle, the deep cervical fascia and platysma myoides, the stemo-mastoid, and the integument. By its deep surface with the184 KLEVATORS OF THE OS HVOIDES. brachial plexus, the scaleni muscles, the phrenic nerve, the sheath of the common carotid artery and jugular vein, the descendens noni nerve, the sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid muscle, and the sterno-hyoid at triangle into a superior or occipital trianple and an inferior or subclavian triamjle; the latter contains the subclavian artery and bra- chial plexus of nerves; the other two boundaries of the subclavian tri- angle are, the sterno-mastoid in front and the clavicle below. The hyoid portion of the muscle, divides the great anterior triangle into an inferior carotid triangle situated below the muscle, and a superior triangle which lies above the muscle and is again subdivided by the digastricus into the suhmaxillarg triangle and the superior carotid tri- angle. The other two boundaries of the inferior carotid triangle, are the middle line of the neck in front and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid behind. The other boundaries of the superior carotid triangle are the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle above and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid behind. Actions.—The four mttscles of this group are depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. The three former drawing these parts down- wards in the middle line, and the two omo-hyoidei regulating their traction to the one or other side of the neck, according to the position of the head. The omo-hyoid muscles, by means of their connection with the cervical fascia, are rendered tensors of that portion of the deep cervical fascia which covers the lower part of the neck, between the two sterno-mastoid muscles. Dissectio7i.—These are best dissected by placing a high block be- neath the neck, and throwing the head backwards. The integument has been already dissected away, and the removal of the areolar tissue and fat brings them clearly into view. The Digastricus (?g, twice, ’yeca-rr,^, belly) is a small muscle situ- ated immediately beneath the side of the body of the lower jaw; it is fleshy at each extremit}', and tendinous in the middle It arises from the digastric fossa, upon the inner side of the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and is inserted into a depression on the inner side of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis. The middle tendon is held in connection with the body of the os h}'oides bj"^ an aponeurotic loop, through which it plays as through a pulley; the loop being lubricated by a synovial membrane. A thin layer of aponeurosis is given off from the tendon of the digastricus at each side, which is connected with the body of the os hyoides and forms a strong plane of fascia its insertion. The scapular portion of the muscle divides the great Tim'd Group.—Elevators of the Os Hyoides.

Rdutions.—its supei-ficial surface with the platysma myoides, the steruo-mastoid, the anterior fasciculus of the stylo-hyoid muscle, the parotid gland, and submaxillaiy gland. By its deep surface with the styloid muscles, the hyo-glossus, the m)do-h3^oid muscle, the ex- ternal carotid artery, the lingual and the facial arteries, the internal carotid arterj', the jugular vein, and the hypoglossal nerve. The digastric muscle forms the two inferior boundaries of the submaxillary triangle, the superior boundary being the side of the body of the lower jaw. In the posterior half of the submaxillary triangle are situated the submaxillary gland and the facial arteiy. The Stylo-hyoideus is a small and slender muscle situated in immediate relation with the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, being pierced by its tendon. It arises from the middle of the styloid process, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides near the middle line. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the posterior belly of the digastricus, the parotid gland and sub-maxillary gland ; its deep re- lations are similar to those of the posterior belly of the digastricus. The digastricus and stylo-hyoideus must be removed from their con- nection with the lower jaw and os hyoideus, and turned aside in order to see the next muscle. The Mylo-hyoideus {puXti, mola, i. e. attached to the molar ridge of the lower jaw) is a broad and triangular plane of muscular fibres, fonning, with its fellow of the opposite side, the inferior wall or floor of the mouth. It arises from the molar ridge on the lower jaw, and proceeds obliquely inwards to be inserted into the raphe of the two muscles and into the body of the os hyoides; the raphe is sometimes deficient at its anterior part. Relations.—By its superficial or inferior surface, with the platysma myoides, the digastricus, the supra-hyoidean fascia, the submaxillary gland, and the submental artery. By its deep or superior surface with the genio-hyoideus, the genio-hjm-glossus, the hyo-glossus, the stylo- glossus, the gustatory nerve, the hypo-glossal nerve, Wharton’s duct, the sublingual gland, and the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. After the mylo-hyoideus has been examined, it should be cut away from its origin and insertion, and completely removed. The view of the next muscles would also be greatly improved by dividing the lower jaw on the near side of the symphysis, and drawing it outwards; or by removing it altogether, if the ramus have been already cut across in dissecting the internal pterygoid muscle. The tongue may then be drawn out of the mouth by means of a hook. The Gemo-hyoideus {yivui>\i, the chin) arises from a small tubercle upon the inner side of the symphj’sis of the lower jaw, and is inserted into the upper part of the body of the os hyoides. It is a short and slender muscle, very closely connected with the border of the following.MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE, lielalions.—By its superficial or inferior surface with the mylo- hyoideus; by the deep or superior surface with the lower border of the genio-hyo-glossus. The Genio-iiyo-glossus {yXuaffa,, the tongue) is a triangular muscle, narrow and pointed at its origin from the lower jaw, broad and fan-shaped at its attachment to the tongue. It arises from a tubercle immediately above that of the genio-hyoideus, and spreads out to be inserted into the whole length of the tongue, from its base to the apex, and into the body of the os hyoides. Relations.—By its inner surface with its fellow of the opposite side. By its outer surface with the mylo-hyoideus, the hyo-glossus, the stylo-glossus, lingualis, the sublingual gland, the lingual artery, and the hj’^po-glossal nerve. By its upper border with the mucous mem- brane of the floor of the mouth, in the situation of the frsenum linguae; and by the lower border with the genio-hyoideus. Actions. — The whole of this group of muscles act upon the os hyoides when the lower jaw is closed, and upon the lower jaw when the os hyoides is drawn downwards and fixed by the depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. The genio-hyo-glossus is, moreover, a muscle of the tongue : its action upon that organ shall be considered with the next group. Fourth Group.—Muscles of the Tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Lingualis, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. These are already exposed by the preparation we have just made ; there remains, therefore, only to dissect and examine them. The Genio-hyo-glossus, the first of these muscles, has been described with the last group. The Hyo-glossus is a square-shaped plane of muscle, arising Roto. the whole length of the great cornu and from the body of the os hyoides, and inserted between the stylo-glossus and lingualis into the side of the tongue. The direction of the fibres of that portion of the muscle which arises from the body is obliquely backwards ; and that from the great cornu obliquely forwards ; hence thej' are described by Albinus as two distinct muscles, under the names of basio-glossus and cerato-glossus, to which he added a third fasciculus, arising from the lesser cornu, and spreading along the side of the tongue, the chondro- glossus. The basio-glossus slightly overlaps the cerato-glossus at its upper part, and is separated from it by the transverse portion of the stylo-glossus. Relations.—By its eodernal surface with the digastric muscle, the stylo-hyoideus, st3do-glossus, and mylo-hyoideus, with the gustator}' nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, Wharton’s duct, and the sublingual gland. By its internal surface with the middle constrictor of theLINGUALIS.—STYLO-GLOSSUS. 187 r phan'Tix, the lingualis, the genio-hyo-glossus, the lingual artery, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Lingualis.—The fibres of this muscle may be seen towards the apex of the tongue, issuing from the interval between the h}'^o- glossus and genio-hyo-glossus ; it is best examined by removing the Fig. 88.* preceding muscle. It consists of a small fasciculus of fibres, running longitudinally from the base, where it is attached to the os hyoides, to the apex of the tongue. It is in relation by its under surface with the ranine artery. The Stylo-glossus arises from the apex of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament ; it divides upon the side of the * The styloid muscles and the muscles of the tongue. 1.

Professor Hyrtl of Prague has described a fasciculus of this muscle arising from the outer side of the styloid muscle and inserted into the cartilage of the meatus auris, under the name of siylo-auricularis. He states that this muscle occurs in one of every six bodies. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, the gustatory nerve, the parotid gland, sublingual gland, and the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. By its intermd sur- face with the tonsil, the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, and the hyo-glossus muscle. The Palato-ulossus passes between the soft palate and the side of the base of the tongue, forming a projection of the mucous mem- brane, which is called the anterior pillar of the soft palate. Its fibres are lost superiorly among the muscular fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, and inferiorly among the fibres of the stylo-glossus upon the side of the tongue. This muscle with its fellow constitutes the constrictor isthmi faucium. Actions.—The genio-hyo-glossus muscle effects several movements of the tongue, as might be expected from its extent. When the tongue is steadied and pointed by the other muscles, the posterior fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus would dart it from the mouth, while its anterior fibres would restore it to its original position. The whole length of the muscle acting upon the tongue, would render it concave along the middle line, and form a channel for the current of fluid towards the phatynx, as in sucking. The apex of the tongue is directed to the roof of the mouth, and rendered convex from before backwards by the linguales. The hyo-glossi, by drawing down the sides of the tongue, render it convex along the middle line. It is drawn upwards at its base by the palato-glossi, and backwards or to either side by the stylo- glossi. Thus the whole of the complicated movements of the tongue may be explained, by reasoning upon the direction of the fibres of the muscles, and their probable actions. The palato-glossi muscles, as- sisted by the uvula, have the power of closing the fauces completelj', an action which takes place in deglutition. Fifth Group.—Muscles of the Pharynx. Constrictor inferior. Constrictor medius. Constrictor superior, Stylo-pharyngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. Dissection.—To dissect the pharynx, the trachea and (esophagus are to be cut through at the lower part' of the neck, and drawn up- wards by dividing the loose areolar tissue which connects the pharynx189 CONSTRICTOR JIKDICS. CONSTRICTOR SUPERIOR. to the vertebral column. The saw is then to be applied behind the styloid processes, and the base of the skull sawn through. The vessels and loose structures should be removed from the preparation, and the pharyn.v stuffed with tow or wool for the purpose of distend- ing it, and rendering the muscles more easy of dissection. The pha- r^’nx is invested by a proper pharyngeal fascia. The Constrictor inferior, the thickest of the three muscles of this class, arises from the upper rings of the trachea, the cricoid car- tilage, and the oblique line of the thyroid. Its fibres spread out and are inserted into the fibrous raphe of the middle of the pharynx, the inferior fibres being almost horizontal, and the superior oblique, and overlapping the middle constrictor. Relations.—Bj' its external surface with the anterior surface of the vertebral column, the longus colli, the sheath of the common carotid arter}', the sterno-thyroid muscle, the thyroid gland, and some lymph- atic glands. By its internal szirface with the middle constrictor, the stylo-pharyngeus, the palato-pharyngeus, and the mucous membrane of the pharynx. By its loiver border, near the cricoid cartilage, it is in relation Avith the recurrent nerve; and by the upper border with the superior larv'ngeal nerve. The fibres of origin of this muscle are blended Avith those of the sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and crico- thyroid, and it frequently forms a tendinous arch across the lattei’. This muscle must be removed before the next can be examined. The Constrictor medius anses from the great cornu of the os hyoides, from the lesser comu, and from the stylo-hyoidean ligament. It radiates, from its origin, upon the side of the pharynx, the loAver fibres descending and being overlapped by the constrictor inferior, and the upper fibres ascending so as to cover in the constrictor superior. It is inserted into the rapM and by a fibrous aponeurosis into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its external surface Avith the vertebral column, the longus colli, rectus anticus major, the carotid A-essels, inferior constric- tor, hyo-glossus muscle, lingual arterj', pharj’ngeal plexus of nerv'es, and some lymphatic glands. By its internal surface, Avith the superior constrictor, stylo-phimyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous mem- brane of the phaiynx. The upper portion of this muscle must be turned down, to bring the AA'hole of the superior constrictor into view ; in so doing, the stylo-pharj'ugeus muscle will be seen passing behind its upper border. The Constrictor superior is a thin and quadrilateral plane of muscular fibres arising from the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower JaAv, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and from the loAver half of the internal pterygoid plate, and inserted into the raphe and basilar process of the occipital bone. Its superior fibres are arched and leave a concave interspace betAveen its upper border and the basilar process, and it is overlapped inferiorly by the middle con- strictor. BetAveen the side of the pharynx and the ramus of the loAver jaAV is a triangular interval, the muoMo-pharyngeal space, Avhich190 STYLO-I’HARVNGEUS. is bounded on the inner side by the superior constrictor muscle ; on tlie outer side by the internal pterygoid muscle ; and behind by the rectus anticus major and vertebral column. In this space are situated the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, spinal accessory, and hypo-glossal nerves. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column and the muscles of the latter, behind ; with the vessels and nerve? con- tained in the inaxillo-pharyngeal space laterally, and with the middle constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, and tensor palati muscle. By its internal surface with the levator palati, palato-pharyngeus, tonsil, and mucous membrane of the pharynx, the pharyngeal fascia being interposed. The Stylo-pharyngeus is a long and slender muscle arising from the inner side of the base of the styloid process; it descends between the superior and middle con- strictor muscles.and spreads out beneath the mucous membrane of the pharynx, its inferior fibres being in- serted into the posterior bor- der of the thyroid cartilage. Relations.—By its exter- nal surface with the stylo- glossus muscle, external ca- rotid artery, parotid gland, and the middle constrictor. By its interned surface with the internal carotid arterj’, internal jugular vein, supe- rior constrictor, palato-pha- ryngeus, and mucous mem- brane. Along its lower bor- der is seen the glosso- pharyngeal nerve which crosses it, opposite the root of the tongue, to pass between the superior and middle constrictor and behind the hyo- glossus. The palato-pharyngeus is described with the muscles of the soft pa- * A side view of the muscles of the pharynx. 1. The trachea. 2. The cri- coid cartilage. 3. The crico-thyroid membrane. 4.

It arises from the soft palate, and is inserted into the inner sur- face of the pharynx, and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. Actions.— The three constrictor muscles are important agents in deglutition ; they contract upon the morsel of food as soon as it is received by' the pharynx, and convey it downwards into the oeso- phagus. The styio-pharyTigei draw the pharynx upwards and widen it laterally. The palato-pharyngei also draw it upwards, and with ' the aid of the uvula close the opening of the fauces. Sixth Group.—Muscles of the soft Palate. Levator palati. Tensor palati, Azy'gos uvulae, Palato-glossus, Palato -pharymgeus. Dissection.—To examine these muscles, the pharynx must be opened from behind, and the mucous membrane carefully removed from off the posterior surface of the soft palate. The Levator palati, a moderately thick muscle, arises from the extremity of the pe- trous bone and from the poste- rior and inferior aspect of the Eustachian tube, and passing down by the side of the poste- rior nares spreads out in the structure of the soft palate as far as the middle line. Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and superior constrictor muscle ; internally and posteriorly with the mucous membrane of the pharynx and soft palate ; and by its lower border with the palato-pharyn- geus. * The muscles of the soft palate. 1.

This muscle must be turned down from its origin on one side, and removed, and the superior constrictor dissected away from its ptery- goid origin, to bring the next muscle into view. The Tensor PALATi (circumflexus) is a slender and flattened muscle ; it arises from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the intejiial pterygoid plate and from the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube. It descends to the hamular process around which it turns, and expands into a tendinous aponeurosis, which is inserted into the transverse ridge on the horizontal portion of the palate bone, and into the raphe. Relations. — By its external surfaee with the internal pterygoid muscle ; by its internal surface with the levator palati, internal ptery- goid plate, and superior constrictor. In the soft palate, its tendinous expansion is placed in front of the other muscles and in contact with the mucous membrane. The Azygos uvuLiE is not a single muscle, as might be inferred from its name, but a pair of small muscles placed side b)' side in the middle line of the soft palate. They arise from the spine of the palate bone, and are inserted into the uvula. By their anterior sur- face they are connected with the tendinous expansion of the levatores palati, and by the posterior with the mucous membrane. The two next muscles are brought into view throughout the whole of their extent, by raising the mucous membrane from off the pillars of the soft palate at each side. The Palato-glossus (constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fascicu- lus of fibres that arises in the soft palate, and descends to be inserted into the side of the tongue. It is the projection of this small muscle, covered by mucous membrane, that forms the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium from a function it performs in common with the palato-pharyngeus, viz. of constricting the opening of the fauces. The Palato-pharyngeus forms the posterior pillar of the fauces ; it arises by an expanded fasciculus from the lower part of the soft palate, where its fibres are continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side ; and is inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is broad above where it forms the whole thick- ness of the lower half of the soft palate, narrow in the posterior pillar, and again broad and thin in the pharynx where it spreads out pre- viously to its insertion. Relations. — In the soft palate it is in relation with the mucous membrane both by its anterior and posterior surface ; above, with the muscular layer formed by the levator palati, and beloxo with the mu- cous glands situated along the margin of the arch of the palate.

In the pharynx, it is in relation by its outer surface with, the superior and middle constrictor muscles, and by its inner surface with the mucous membrane of the pharynx, the pha- rj'iigeal fascia being interposed. Actions,—The azygos uvulae shortens the uvula. The levator palati raises the soft palate, while the tensor spreads it out laterally so as to form a septum between the pharynx and posterior nares. Taking its fixed point from below, the tensor palati will dilate the Eustachian tube. The palato-glossus and palato-pharjmgeus constrict the opening of the fauces, and by drawing down the soft palate, they serve to press the mass of food from the dorsum of the tongue into the pharynx. Seventh Group.—Prcevertehral Muscles. Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor. Scalenus anticus. Scalenus posticus, Longus colli. Dissection.—These muscles have already been exposed by the removal of the face from the anterior aspect of the vertebral colmnn ; all that is further needed is the removal of the fascia, by which they are invested. The Rectus anticus major, broad and thick above, and narrow and pointed below, arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Be/ations.—By its anterior surface with the pharynx, the internal carotid arterj-, internal jugular vein, superior cervical ganglion, sympa- thetic nen-e, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerve. By its pos- terior surface with the longus colli, rectus anticus minor, and superior cen ical vertebrae. The Rectus anticus minor arises from the anterior border of the lateral mass of the atlas, and is inserted into the basilar process; its fibres being directed obliquely upwards and itiwards. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the rectus anticus major, and externally with the superior cervical gangbon of the sympathetic. By its posterior surface with the articulation of the condyle of the occipital bone with the atlas, and with the anterior occipito-atloid ligament. The Scalenus anticus is a triangular muscle, as its name implies, situated at the root of the neck, and appearing like a continuation of the rectus anticus major ; it arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vcr- tebrze, and is inserted into the tubercle upon the inner border of the first rib. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the sterno-mastoid and o194 SCALENUS POSTICUS. omo-hyoid muscle, with the cervicalis superficialis and posterior sca- pular artery, with the phrenic nerve, and with the subclavian vein, bj'' which it is separated from the subclavius muscle and clavicle. By its posterior surface with the nerves which go to form the brachial plexus, and below with the subclavian artery. By its inner svle it is separated from the longus colli by the vertebral artery. Its relations with the subclavian artery and vein are very important, the vein being before and the artery behind the muscle.” The Scalenus posticus arises from the cervical vertebrae excepting the first. Fig. 91.t the posterior tubercles of all It is inseHed by two fleshy fasciculi into the first and second ribs. The anterior (scalenus medius) of the two fasciculi is large, and occupies all the surface of the first rib between the groove for the subclatdan artery and the tuberosity. The posterior (scalenus pos- ticus) is small, and is at- tached to the second rib. Albinus and Soemmering make five scaleni. Relations.—By its ante- rior surface with the bra- chial plexus and subclavian artery; posteriorly with the levator anguli scapulae, cer- vicalis ascendens, transver- salis colli and sacro-lum- balis ; internally with the first intercostal muscle, the first rib, the mter-trans- verse muscles, and cerncal vertebrae ; and externally with the sterno-mastoid, omo-h3'oid, and supra-sca- pular and posterior scapular arteries. * In a subject dissected in the schooi of the Middlesex hospital during the winter of 1841 by Mr. Joseph Bogers, the subclavian artery of the left side was placed with the vein in front of the scalenus anticus muscle. t The praevertebral group of muscles of the neck. 1.

The upper arises from the anterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cer- vical vertebrae. The loieer portion arises from the bodies of the second and third, and transverse processes of the fourth and fifth, and passes down the neck, to be inserted into the bodies of the three lower cervi- cal and three upper dorsal vertebrae. We should thus arrange these attachments in a tabular form ;— Oriffin. Insertion, Upper 1 S 3rd, 4th, and 5th transverse portion. ^ ‘ ^ processes. Lower portion. 2nd and 3rd bodies 4th and 5th transverse processes . 3 lower cervical vertebrae, bo- dies. 3 upper dorsal, bodies. In general terms, the muscle is attached to the bodies and trans- verse processes of the five superior cervical vertebrae above, and to the bodies of the last three cervical and first three dorsal below. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pharynx, oesophagus, the sheath of the common carotid, internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve, the sjunpathetic nerve, inferior laryngeal nerve, and inferior thyroid arter}'. By its posterior surface it rests upon the cervicahand upper dorsal vertebrae. Actions—The rectus anticus major and minor preserve the equi- librium of the head upon the atlas ; and, acting conjointly with the longus colli, flex and rotate the head and the cervical portion of the vertebral column. The scaleni muscles, taking their fixed point from below, jire flexors of the vertebral column ; and, from above, elevators of the ribs, and therefore inspiratory muscles. Eighth Group.— Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Chapter X. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the trunk may be subdivided into four natural . groups; viz. 1. Muscles of the back. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perineum. 1. Muscles of the Bark,—The region of the hack, in consequence of its extent, is common to the neck, the upper extremities, and the196 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. abdomen. The muscles of which it is composed are numerous, and may be arranged into six layers. Transversalis colli, T rachelo-mastoideus, Complexus. Fifth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Semi-spinalis dorsi, Semi-spinalis colli. (Cervical Group.) Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor. Rectus lateralis, Obliquus inferior, Obliquus superior. Sixth Layer. Multifidus spinae, Levatores costarum, Supra-spinalis, Inter-spinales, Inter-transversales. First Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of this lajmr are to be dissected by making an incision along the middle line of the back, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the coccyx. From the upper point of this incision carry a second along the side of the neck, to the middle of the clavicle. Inferiorlj'’ an incision must be made from the extremity of the sacrum, along the crest of the ilium, to about its middle. For convenience of dissection, a fourth may be carried from the middle of the spine to the acromion process. The integument and superficial fascia, together, are to be dissected off the muscles in the course of their fibres, over the whole of this region. The Trapezius muscle (trapezium, a quadrangle with unequal sides) arises from the superior curved line of the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchas, supra-spinous ligament, and spinous processes of the last cervical and all the dorsal vertebrae. The fibres converge from these various points, and are inserted into the scapular third of the clavicle, the acromion process, and the whole length of the upper border of the spine of the scapula. The inferior fibres become tendi- nous near the scapula, and glide over the triangular surface at the posterior extremity of its spine, upon a bursa mucosa. When the trapezius is dissected on both sides, the two muscles resemble a tra- First Layer, Trapezius, X«atissimus dorsi. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulm, Rhomboideus minor, Rhomboideus major.

The cervical and upper part of the dorsal portion of the muscle is tendinous at its origin, and forms, with the muscle of the opposite side, a kind of tendinous ellipse. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, to which it is closely adherent by its cervical por- tion, loosely by its dorsal portion. By its deep surface, from above dowmwards, with the complexus, splenius, levator anguli scapulae, supra-spinatus, a small portion of the serratus posticus superior, rhom- boideus minor, rhomboideus major, intervertebral aponeurosis which separates it from the erector spinas, and with the latissimus dorsi. The anterior border of the ceiudcal portion of this muscle forms the poste- rior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck. The clavicular insertion of the muscle sometimes advances to the middle of the cla- vicle, or as far as the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, and occa- sionally it has been seen to overlap the latter. This is a point of much importance to be borne in mind in the operation for ligature of the subclavian artery. The spinal accessory nerve passes beneath the anterior border, near the clavicle, previously to its distribution to the muscle. The ligamentum nuclice is a thin areolo-fibrous layer extended from the tubercle and spine of the occipital bone, to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supra- spinous ligament. It is connected with the spinous processes of the rest of the cervical vertebrje, with the exception of the atlas, by means of a small fibrous slip which is sent oflF by each. It is the analogue of an important elastic ligament in animals. The Lati.ssi-mu.s Dor.si muscle covers the whole of the lower part of the back and loins. It arises from the spinous processes of the six inferior dorsal vertebrae, from all the lumbar and sacral spinous pro- cesses, from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and from the three lower ribs; the latter origin takes place by muscular slips, which indigitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive origin converge as they ascend, and cross the inferior angle of the scapula ; they then curve around the lower bor- der of the teres major muscle, and terminate in a short quadrilateral tendon,* which lies in front of the tendon of the teres, and is inseHed into the bicipital groove. A synovial bursa is interposed between the muscle and the lower angle of the scapula, and another between its tendon .and that of the teres major. The muscle frequently receives a small fasciculus from the sc.apula as it crosses its inferior angle.

The latissimus dorsi, with the teres major, forms the posterior border of the axilla. Second Layer. Dissection.—This layer is brought into view by dividing the two preceding muscles near their insertion, and turning them to the op- posite side. The Levator anguli scapulae arises by distinct slips, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the foim upper cer- vical vertebrae, and is inserted into the upper angle and posterior bor- der of the scapula, as far as the triangular smooth surface at the root of its spine. Relations.—By its supei'ficial surface with the trapezius, stemo- mastoid, and integument. By its deep surface with the splenius colli, transversalis colli, cervicalis ascendens, scalenus posticus, and serratus posticus superior. The tendons of origin are interposed between the attachments of the scalenus posticus in front and the splenius colli behind. The Rho.mboideus minor (rhombus, a parallelogram with four equal sides) is a narrow slip of muscle, detached from the rhomboideus major b}' a slight areolar interspace. It arises from the spinous pro- cess of the last cervical vertebra and ligamentum nuchas, and is in- serted into the edge of the triangular suil'ace, on the posterior border of the scapula. The Rhomboideus major aHses from the spinous processes of the four upper dorsal vertebrae and from the inter-spinous ligaments; it is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula as far as its inferior angle. The upper and middle portion of the insertion is effected by means of a tendinous band which is attached in a longitudinal direc- tion to the posterior border of the scapula. Relations.—By their supeifcial suface the two rhomboid muscles are in relation with the trapezius, and the rhomboideus major with the latissimus dorsi and integument. By their deep surface they cover in the serratus posticus superior, part of the erector spinse, the intercostal muscles and ribs. splenius is seen attached to the spinous processes below the lower border of the rhomboideus major. 15.

It is brought into view by dividing the levator anguli scapulaj near its insertion, and reflecting the two rhomboid muscles upwards from their insertion into the scapula. The latter muscles should now be removed. The Serratus posticus superior is situated at the upper part of the thorax; it arises from the ligamentum nuchae, the spinous process of the last cervical and those of the two upper dorsal vertebrae. The muscle passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted by four serrations into the upper border of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. Relations. — By its superficial surface with the trapezius, rhom- boideus major and minor, and serratus magnus. By its deep surface with the splenius, the upper part of the erector spinae, the intercostal muscles and ribs. The Serratus posticus inferior arises from the spinous pro- cesses and interspinous ligaments of the last two dorsal and two upper lumbar vertebrae, and passing obliquely upwards is inserted bj' four serrations into the lower border of the four lower ribs. Both muscles are constituted by a thin aponeurosis for about half their extent. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the latissimus dorsi, its tendinous origin being inseparably connected with the aponeurosis of that muscle. By its deep surface with the aponeurosis of the obliquus internus, with which it is also closely adherent ; with the erector spinae, the intercostal muscles and lower ribs. The upp>er border is continuous with a thin tendinous layer, the vertebral aponeurosis. The VeHebral aponeurosis is a thin membranous expansion composed of longitudinal and transverse fibres, and extending the whole length of the thoracic region. It is attached mesially to the spinous pro- cesses of the dorsal vertebrae, and externally to the angles of the ribs ; superiorly it is continued upwards beneath the serratus posticus supe- rior, with the lower border of which it is sometimes connected. It serves to bind down the erector spinae, and separate it from the super- ficial muscles. The serratus posticus superior must be removed from its origin and turned outwards, to bring into view the whole extent of the splenius muscle. The Splenius muscle is single at its origin, but divides soon after into two portions, which are destined to distinct insertions. It arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchae, from the spinous pro- cess of the last cervical, and from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the six upper dorsal vertebrae ; it divides as it ascends the neck into the splenius capitis and colli. The splenius capitis is in- serted into the rough surface of the occipital bone between the two curved lines, and into the mastoid portion of the temporal bone.201 FOURTH LAYER.

By its deep sivrface with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis colli, complexus, trachelo-mastoid, and transversalis colli. The tendons of insertion of the splenius colli are interposed between the insertions of the levator anguli scapulm in front, and the transversalis colli behind. The splenii of opposite sides of the neck leave between them a trian- gular interval, in which the complexus is seen. Fourth Layer. Dissection.—The two serrati and two splenii muscles must be re- moved by cutting them away from their origins and insertions, to bring the fourth layer into view. Three of these muscles, viz. sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and spinalis dorsi, are associated under the name of erector spinse. They occupy the lumbar and dorsal portion of the back. The remaining four are situated in the cervical region. The Sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi arise by a common origin from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, from the pos- terior surface of the sacrum, and from the lumbar vertebrse ; opposite the last rib a line of separation begins to be perceptible between the two muscles. The sacro-lumhalis is inserted by separate tendons into the angles of the six lower ribs. On turning the muscle a little out- wards, a number of tendinous slips will be seen taking their origin from the ribs, and terminating in a muscular fasciculus, by which the sacro-lumbalis is prolonged to tbe upper part of the thorax. This is the musculus accessorius ad sacro-hinibalem; it arises from the angles of the six lower ribs, and is inserted by separate tendons into the tingles of the six upper ribs. The longissimus dorsi is inserted into all the ribs, between their tubercles and angles. The Spinalis dorsi arises from the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar and two lower dorsal vertebrse, and is inserted into the spinous processes of all the upper dorsal vertebrse ; the two muscles form an ellipse, which appears to enclose the spinous processes of all the dorsal vertebrse. Relations,—The erector spinse muscle is in relation by its super- ficial surface (in the lumbar region) with the conjoined aponeurosis of the transversalis and internal oblique muscle, which separates it from the aponeurosis of the senutus posticus inferior, and longissimus dorsi; (in the dorsal region) with the vertebral aponeurosis, which separates it from the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and serratus posticus superior, and with the splenius.

IntermiUy or mesially with the multifidus spinm, and semi-spinalis dorsi, which separate it from the spinous processes and arches of the vertebras. The two layers of aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis, toge- ther with the spinal column in the lumbar region, and the vertebral aponeurosis with the ribs and spinal column in the dorsal region, form a complete osseo-aponeurotic sheath for the erector spirim. The Cervicalis ascendens is the continuation of the sacro-lumbalis upwards into the neck. It arises from the angles of the four upper ribs, and is inserted by slender tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator anguli sca- pulrn ; by its deep surface with the upper intercostal muscles and ribs, and with the intertransverse muscles ; externally with the scalenus posticus ; and internally with the transversalis colli. The tendons of insertion are interposed between the attachments of the scalenus pos- ticus and transversalis colli. The Transversalis colli would appear to be the continuation upwards into the neck of the longissimus dorsi; it arises from the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal verte- brae, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of the four or five inferior cervical vertebrae. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator anguli sca- pulae, splenius and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with the complexus, trachelo-mastoideus and vertebrae ; externally with the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem, and cervicalis ascendens; in- ternally with the trachelo-mastoideus and complexus. The tendons of insertion of this muscle are interposed between the tendons of inser- tion of the cervicalis ascendens on the outer side, and those of origin of the trachelo-mastoid on the inner side. The Trachelo-mastoid is likewise a continuation upwards from the longissimus dorsi. It is a verj' slender and delicate muscle, arising from the transverse processes of the four upper dorsal and four lower cervical vertebrie, and inserted into the mastoid process to the inner side of the digastric fossa. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, excepting that it is interposed between the transversalis colli and the complexus. Its tendons of attachment are the most posterior of those which are connected with the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebra;. The Complexes is a large muscle, and with the splenius forms the great bulk of the back of the neck. It crosses the direction of the splenius, arising from the transverse processes of the four upper dor- sal, and from the transverse and articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebra;, and is inserted into the rough surface on the occipital204 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. bone between the two curved lines, near the occipital spine. A large fasciculus of the coinplexus is so distinct from the principal mass of the muscle as to have led to its description as a separate muscle under the name of biventer cervicis. This appellation is not inappropriate lor the muscle consists of a central tendon, with two fleshy bellies. The coinplexus is crossed in the upper part of the neck by a tendinous intersection. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, splenius, trachelo-niastoid, transversalis colli,’ and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with the semi-spinalis dorsi and colli, the recti and obliqui. It is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the ligamentum nuchae, and from the semi-spinalis colli by the profunda ceiricis artery and princeps cervicis branch of the occipital, and by the posterior cer- vical plexus of nerves. Fifth Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of the preceding layer are to be removed by dividing them transversely through the middle, and turning one extremity upwards, the other downwards. In this way the whole of the muscles of the fourth layer may be got rid of, and the remaining muscles of the spine brought into a state to be examined. The Semi-spinales muscles are connected with the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebrae, spanning one-half of the verte- bral column ; hence their name, semi-spinales. The Semi-spinalis dorsi arises from the transverse processes of the six lower dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spinous pro- cesses of the four upper dorsal, and two lower cervical vertebrae. The Semi-spinalis colli arises from the transverse processes of the four upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spinous pro- cesses of the four upper cervical vertebrae, commencing with the axis. Relations.—By tlieir superficial surface the semi-spinales are in rela- tion from below upwards with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, complexus, splenius, with the profunda cervicis and princeps cervicis artery, and posterior cervical plexus of nerves. By their deep surface with the multifidus spinae muscle. Occipital Group.—This group of small muscles is intended for the varied movements of the cranium on the atlas, and the atlas on the axis. The Rectus posticus major aidses from the spinous process of the axis, and is inserted into the inferior curved line of the occipital bone. The Rectus posticus minor arises from the spinous tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted into the rough surface on the occipital bone, beneath the inferior curved line. The Rectus lateralis is extended between the transverse pro- cess of the atlas and the occipital bone ; it arises from the transverse205 SIXTH LAYER. process of the atlas, and is inserted into the rough surface of the occi- pital bone, extenial to the condyle. The Obliquus inferior arises from the spinous process of the axis, and passes obliquely outwards to be inserted into the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. The Obliquus superior aiises from the extremity of the trans- verse process of the atlas, and passes obliquely inwards to be inserted into the rough surfece of the occipital bone, between the curved lines. Relations.—By their superficial surfaee the recti and obliqui are in relation with a strong aponeurosis which separates them from the corn- plexus. By their deep surface with the atlas and axis, and their arti- culations. The rectns posticus major partly covers in the rectus minor. The rectus lateralis is in relation by its anterior surface with the internal jugular vein, and by its posterior surface with the vertebral artery. Siocth Layer. Dissection.—The semi-spinales muscles must both be removed to obtain a good view of the multifidus spime, which lies beneath them, and fills up the concavity between the spinous and transverse processes, the whole length of the vertebral column. The MuIvTifidus SPiNiE consists of a great number of fleshy fasci- culi extending between the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebrae, from the sacrum to the axis. Each fasciculus arises from a transverse process, and is inserted into the spinous process of the first or second vertebra above. Some deep fasciculi of the multifidus spinae have recently been described by Theile under the name of rotatores sjnnce. Relations.—By its superficial sutface with the longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis dorsi, and semi-spinalis colli. By its deep surface with the arches and spinous processes of the vertebral column, and in the cervical region with the ligamentum nuchae. The Levatores costarum, twelve in number on each side, arise from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, and pass ob- liquely outwards and downwards to be inserted into the rough surface between the tubercle and angle of the rib below them. The first of these muscles arises from the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and the last from that of the eleventh dorsal. The levatores of the inferior ribs, besides the distribution here described, send a fasciculus downwards to the second rib below their origin, and conse- quently are inserted into two ribs. Relations.—By their superfieial surface with the longissimus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis. By their deep suiface with the intercostal muscles and ribs. The SuPRA-SPiNALiH is a small and irregular muscle lying upon the spinous processes in the cervical region, and composed of several fasciculi. The fasciculi arise from the inferior cervical and superiorMUSCLES OP THE HACK. 20G dorsal vertebrae, and fire mserled into tlie spinous process of the axis. From its analogy to the spinalis dorsi tliis muscle has been named spinalis colli. It is sometimes wanting. The Interspinales are small muscular slips firranged in pairs and situated between the spinous processes of the vertehrm. In the cer- vical region there are six pairs of these muscles, the first being placed between the axis and third vertebra, and the sixth between the last cervical and first dorsal. In the dorsal region, rudiments of these muscles are occasionally met with between the upper and lower verte- bras, but are absent in the rest. In the lumbar region there are six pairs of interspinales, the first pair occupying the interspinous space between the last dorsal and first lumbfir vertebra, and the hist the space between the fifth lumbar and sacrum. Thej"^ are thin and im- perfectly developed. Rudimentary interspinales are occasionalh* met with between the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx ; these are the analogues of the caudal muscles of brutes ; in man they have been named collectively the eoctensor coeeygis. The Intertransversales are small quadrilateral muscles situated between the transverse processes of the vertebrm. In the cervical region they are arranged in pairs corresponding with the double con- formation of the transverse processes, the vertebral artery and anterior division of the cervical nerves lying between them. The rectus an- ticus minor and rectus lateralis represent the intertransversales be- tween the atlas and cranium. In the dorsal region the anterior inter- transversales are represented by the intercostal muscles, while the pos- terior are mere tendinous bands, muscular only between the first and last vertebrffi. In the lumbar region, the anterior intertransversales are thin and occupy only part of the space between the transverse processes. Analogues of posterior intertransversales exist in the form of small muscular fasciculi (interobliqui) extended between the nidi- mentary posterior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebras. With regal’d to the origin and insertion of the muscles of the back, the student should be informed that no regularit}’- attends their at- tachments. At the best, a knowledge of their exact connections, even were it possible to retain it, would be but a barren information, if not absolutely injurious, as tending to exclude more valuable learning. I have therefore endeavoured to arrange a plan, b}"- which thej* may be more easily recollected, by placing them in a tabular form (p. 208), that the student may see, at a glance, the origin and insertion of each, and compare the natural grouping and similarity of attachments of the various layers. In this manner, also, their actions will be better com- prehended, and learnt with greater facility. Actions.—The upper fibres of the trapezius draw the shoulder upwards and backwards ; the middle fibres, directly backwards ; and the lower, downwards and backwards. The lower fibres also act by producing rotation of the scapula upon the chest. If the shoulder be fixed, the upper fibres will flex the spine towards the corresponding side. The latissimus dorsi is a muscle of the arm, drawung it back-■207 SIXTH LAYER. wards and downwards, and at the same time rotating it inwards ; if the arm be fixed, the latissimus dorsi will draw the spine to that side, and, raising the lower ribs, be an inspiratory muscle; and if both arms be fixed, the two muscles will draw the whole trunk forwards, as in climbing or walking on crutches. The levator anguli scapulae lifts the upper angle of the scapula, and with it the entire shoulder, and the rhomboidei carry the scapula and shoulder upwards and backwards. In examining the following table, the student will observe the constant reciurrence of the number four in the origin and insertion of the muscles. Sometimes the four occurs at the top or bottom of a region of the spine, and frequently includes a part of two regions, and takes two from each, as in the case of the serrati. Again, he will perceive that the muscles of the upper half of the table take their origin firom spinous pr^fecesses, and pass outwards to transverse, whereas the lower half arise mostly from transverse processes. To the student, then, we commit these reflections, and leave it to the peculiar tenor of his own mind to make such arrangements as will be best retained by his memory. The serrati are respiratory muscles acting in opposition to each other, the serratus posticus superior drawing the ribs upwards, and thereby expanding the chest ; and the inferior drawing the lower ribs dowmwards and diminishing the cavity of the chest. The former is an inspiratorj^, the latter an expiratory muscle. The splenii muscles of one side draw the vertebral column backwards and to one side, and rotate the head towards the corresponding shoulder. The muscles of opposite sides, acting together, will draw the head directly backwards. They are the natural antagonists of the sterno-mastoid muscles. The sacro-lumhalis with its accessory muscle, the longissinius dorsi, and the spinalis dorsi, are known by the general term of erectores spince, which sufficiently expresses their action. They keep the spine sup- ported in the vertical position by their broad origin from below, and by means of their insertion, by distinct tendons, into the ribs and spinous processes. Being made up of a number of distinct fasciculi, which alternate in their actions, the spine is kept erect without fa- tigue, even when they have to counterbalance a corpulent abdominal development. The continuations upwards of these muscles into the neck preserve the steadiness and uprightness of that region. When the muscles of one side act alone, the neck is rotated upon its axis. The complexus, by being attached to the occipital bone, draws the head backwards, and counteracts the muscles on the anterior pm-t of the neck. It assists also in the rotation of the head. The semi-spinales and muUifidus spince muscles act directly on the vertebrae, and contribute to the general action of supporting the verte- bral column erect. The four little muscles situated between the occiput and the first two vertebrae, effect the various movements between these bones; the recti . producing the antero-posterior actions, and the obliqui the rotatory 1 motions of the atlas on the axis.208 TABLE OF ORIGIN AND INSERTION.

They approximate their attachments and assist the more powerful muscles in preserving the erect position of the body. The levatores costarum raise the posterior parts of the ribs, and are probably more serviceable in preserving the articulation of the ribs from dislocation, than in raising them in inspiration. MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. The principal muscles situated upon the thorax belong in their ac- tions to the upper extremit}’^, with which they will be described. They are the pectoralis major and minor, subclavius and serratus magnus. The true thoracic muscles are few in number, and appertain exclusively to the actions of the ribs; they are, the— Intercostales extemi. Intercostales intemi. Triangularis stemi. The intercostal muscles are two planes of muscular and tendinous fibres directed obliquely between the adjacent ribs and closing the in- tercostal spaces. They are seen partially upon the removal of the pec- toral muscles, or upon the inner surface of the chest. The triangularis sterni is within the chest, and requires the removal of the anterior part of the thorax to bring it into view. The Intercostales externi, eleven on each side, commence pos- teriorly at the tubercles of the ribs, and advance forwards to the cos- tal cartilages where they terminate in a thin aponeurosis which is con- tinued onwards to the sternum. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and inwards, pursuing the same line with those of the ex- ternal oblique muscle of the abdomen. They are thicker than the in- ternal intercostals. The Intercostales Interni, also eleven on each side, commence anteriorly at the sternum, and extend backwards as far as the angles of the ribs, whence they are prolonged to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis. Their fibres are directed obliquely doumwards and backwards, and correspond in direction with those of the internal ob- lique muscle of the abdomen. The two muscles cross each other in the direction of their fibres. In structure the intercostal muscles consist of an admixture of muscular and tendinous fibres. They arise from the two lips of the lower border of the ribs, the external from the outer lip, the internal from the inner, and are inserted into the upper border. Relations.—The external intercostals, by their external surface, with the muscles which immediately invest the chest, viz. the pecto- ralis major and minor, the serratus magnus, serratus posticus superior211 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. and inferior, scalenus posticus; sacro-lurabalis, and longissimus dorsi, with their continuations, the cervicalis ascendens and transversalis colli; the levatores costarum, and the obliquus externus abdominis. By their internal surface with the internal intercostals, the intercostal vessels and nerves, and a thin aponeurosis, and posteriorlj’^ with the pleura. The internal intercostals, by their external surface with the external intercostals, and intercostal vessels and nerves; by their in- ternal surface with the pleura costalis, the triangulai-is sterni, and diaphragm. Connected with the internal intercostals are a variable number of muscular fasciculi which pass from the inner surface of one rib near its middle to the next or next but one below; these are the subcostal or more correctly the intracostal micscles. The Triangularis sterni, situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the side of the sternum, ensiform cartilage, and sternal extremities of the costal car- tilages ; and is inserted by fleshy digitations into the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and often into that of the second. ^ Relations.—By its external surface with the sternum, the ensiform cartilage, the costal cartilages, internal intercostal muscles, and in- ternal mammary vessels. By its internal surface with the pleura costalis, the areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, and the diaphragm. The lower fibres of the triangularis sterni are continuous with those of the diaphragm. Actions.—The intercostal muscles raise the ribs when they act from above, and depress them when they take their fixed point from below. They are, therefore, both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The triangularis sterni draws down the costal cartilages, and is therefore an expiratory muscle. MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The muscles of this region are, the— Obliquus externus (descendens), Obliquus intemus (ascendens). Cremaster, Transversalis, Rectus, Pyramidalis, Quadratus lumborum. Psoas parvus. Diaphragm. Dissection.—The dissection of the abdominal muscles is to be com- menced by making three incisions:—The first, vertical, in the middle2] 2 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. line, from over the lower part of the sternum, to the pubes; the second, ohlique, from the umbilicus, upwards and outwards, to the outer side of the chest, as high as the fifth or sixth rib; and the third, oblique, from the umbilicus, downwards and outwards, to the middle of the crest of the ilium. The three flaps included by these incisions should then be dissected back in the direction of the fibres of the ex- ternal oblique muscle, beginning at the angle of each. The integu- ment and superficial fascia should be dissected off together so as to ex- pose the fibres of the muscle at once. If the external oblique muscle be dissected on both sides, a white tendinous line will be seen along the middle of the abdomen, extend- ing from the ensiform cartilage to the os pubis; this is the lima alba. A little external to it, on each side, two curved lines will be observed extending from the sides of the chest to the os pubis, and bounding the recti muscles: these are the linem semilunares. Some transverse lines, limee transverscB, three or four in number, connect the lineae semilunares with the linea alba. The External oblique muscle (obliquus externus abdominis, descendens) is the external flat muscle of the abdomen. Its name is derived from the obliquity of its direction, and the descending course of its fibres. It arises by fleshy digitations from the external surface of the eight inferior ribs; the five upper digitations being received be- tween corresponding processes of the serratus magnus, and the three lower of the latissimus dorsi. Soon after its origin it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which is inserted into the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for one half its length, the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, spine of the os pubis, pectineal line, front of the os pubis, and linea alba. The lower border of the aponeurosis, which is stretched between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the spine ot the os pubis, is round from being folded inwards, and forms Fowpart's ligament; the insertion into the pectineal line is Gimbernai's ligament. Just above the crest of the os pubis is the external abdominal ring, a triangular opening formed by the separation of the fibres of the apo- neurosis of the external oblique. It is oblique in its direction, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It is bounded below by the crest of the os pubis; on either side, by the borders of the aponeurosis, which are called pillars; and above by some curved fibres {inter-columnar') which originate from Ponpart’s ligament, and cross the upper angle of the ring, so as to give it strength. The external pillar, which is at the same time inferior from the obliquity of the opening, is inserted into the spine of the os pubis; the internal or supe- rior pillar forms an interlacement with its fellow of the opposite side over the front of the symphysis pubis. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female: they are both invested in their passage through it by a thin fascia derived from the edges of the ring, and called inter-columnar fascia, or fascia spermatica.OBLIQUUS INTERNUS ABDOMINIS. 213 The pouch of inguinal hernia, in passing through this opening, re- ceives the inter-columnar fascia as one of its coverings. Jielatio?is.—By its external surface with the superficial fascia and integument, and with the cutaneous vessels and nerves, particularly the superficial epigastric and superficial circuinflexa ilii vessels. It is generally overlapped posteriorly by the latissimus dorsi. By its internal surface with the internal oblique, the lower part of the eight inferior ribs and intercostal muscles, the cremaster, the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The upper border of the external oblique is continuous with the pectoralis major. The external oblique is now to be removed by making an incision across the ribs, just below its origin, to its posterior border ; and an- other along Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the ilium. Poupart’s ligament should be left entire, as it gives attacliment to the next muscles. The muscle may then be turned forwards towards the linea alba, or removed altogether. Tlie Internal oblique muscle (obliquus internus abdominis, as- ^cndens), is the middle flat muscle of the abdomen. It arises from the outer half of Poupart’s ligament, from the middle of the crest of the ilium for two-thirds of its length, and by a thin aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Its fibres diverge from their origin, so that those from Poupart’s ligament curve downwards, those from the anterior part of the crest of the ilium pass transversely, and the rest ascend obliquely. The muscle is inserted into the pecti- neal line and crest of the os pubis, linea alba, and lower borders of the five inferior ribs. Along the upper three-fourths of the linea semilunaris, the aponeu- rosis of the internal oblique separates into two lamellae, which pass one in front and the other behind the rectus muscle to the linea alba, where they are inserted ; along the lower fourth, the aponeurosis passes altogether in front of the rectus without separation. The two layers, which thus enclose the rectus, form for it a partial sheath. The lowest fibres of the internal oblique are inserted into the pecti- neal line of the os pubis in common with those of the transversalis muscle. Hence the tendon of this insertion is called the conjoined tendon of the internal chlique and transversalis. This structure corre- sponds with the external abdominal ring, and forms a protection to what would otherwise be a weak point in the abdomen. Sometimes the tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and becomes forced through the external ring; it then fonns the distinctive covering of direct inguinal hernia. The spermatic cord passes beneath the arched border of the internal 1 oblique muscle, between it and Poupart’s ligament. Diming its pas- t sage some fibres are given off from the lower border of the muscle, ■ which accompany the cord downwards to the testicle, and form loops 1 around it: this is the cremaster muscle. In the descent of oblique I inguinal hernia, which travels the same course with the spermatic c cord, the cremaster muscle forms one of its coverings.wusci.es ok the ABDO.ME.V. 2] 4 Fig. 94.* * The muscles of the anterior aspect of the trunk; on the left side the su- perficial layer is seen, and on the right the deeper layer. 1.

The Cremaster, considered as a distinct muscle, arises from the middle of Poiipart’s ligament, and forms a series of loops upon the spermatic cord. A few of its fibres are inserted into the tunica vaginalis, the rest ascend along the inner side of the cord, to be inserted, with the conjoined tendon, into the pectineal line of the os pubis. Relations.—The internal oblique is in relation by its external surface with the external oblique, latissimus dorsi, spermatic cord, and external abdominal ring. B}' its internal surface with the transversalis muscle, the fascia transversalis, the internal abdominal ring, and spermatic cord. By its loicer and arched border with the spermatic cord. It forms by this border the upper boundary of the spermatic canal. The cremaster is in relation by its external surface with the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique and inter-columnar fascia ; and by its internal surface with the fascia propria of the spermatic cord. The internal oblique muscle is to be removed by separating it from its attachments to the ribs above, and to the crest of the ilium and Poupart’s ligament below. It should be divided behind by a vertical incision extending from the last rib to the crest of the ilium, as its lumbar attachment cannot at present be examined. The muscle is then to be turned forwards. Some degree of care will be required in performing this dissection, from the difficulty of distinguishing between this muscle and the one beneath. A thin layer of areolar tissue is all that separates them for the greater part of their extent. Near the crest of the ilium the circumflexa ilii artery ascends between the two muscles, and forms a valuable guide to their separation. Just above Poupart’s ligament they are so closely connected, that it is impossible I to divide them. The Transversalis is the internal flat muscle of the abdomen; it is transverse in the direction of its fibres, as is implied in its name. It arises from the outer third of Poupart’s ligament, from the internal lip of the crest of the ilimn, its anterior two-thirds ; from the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and from the inner surfaces of the six inferior ribs, indigitating with the diaphragm. Its lower fibres curve downwards, to be inserted, with the lower fibres of the internal oblique, into the pectineal line, and form the conjoined tendon.

The anterior and middle lamellae enclose the quadratus lumborum muscle ; and the middle and posterior, the erector spinae. The union of the posterior lamella of the transversalis with the posterior aponeurosis of the internal oblique, serratus posticus inferior, and latissimus dorsi, constitutes the lumbar fascia. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal oblique, the in- ternal surfaces of the lower ribs, and internal intercostal muscles. By its internal surface with the transversalis fascia, which separates it from the peritoneum, with the psoas magnus, and with the lower part of the rectus and pyramidalis. The spermatic cord and oblique ingui- nal hernia pass beneath the lower border, but have no direct relation with it. To dissect the rectus muscle, its sheath should be opened by a ver- tical incision extending from over the cartilages of the lower ribs to the front of the os pubis. The sheath may then be dissected olf and turned to either side; this is easily done excepting at the linese trans- versae, where a close adhesion subsists between the muscle and the ex- ternal boundary of the sheath. The sheath contains the rectus and pjTamidalis muscle. The Rectus muscle arises by a flattened tendon from the crest of the os pubis, and is inserted into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. It is traversed by several tendinous zigzag intersections, called lineae transversae. One of these is usually situated at the run- bilicus, two above that point, and sometimes one below. They are vestiges of the abdominal ribs of reptiles, and very rarely extend completely through the muscle. Relations.—By its external surface with the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, below with the aponeurosis of the transversalis, and with the pyramidalis. By its internal surface with the ensiform cartilage, the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, with the posterior lamella of the internal oblique, the peritoneum, and the epigastric artery and veins. The Pyramidalis muscle arises from the crest of the os pubis in front of the rectus, and is inserted into the linea alba at about midway between the umbilicus and the os pubis. It is enclosed in the same sheath \vith the rectus, and rests against the lower part of that muscle. This.muscle is sometimes wanting. The rectus may now be divided across the middle, and the two ends drawn aside for the purpose of examining the mode of formation of its sheath. The sheath of the rectus is formed, in front, for the upper three- fourths of its extent, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique and the anterior lamella of the internal oblique, and behind by the poste- rior lamella of the internal oblique and the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis. At the commencement of the lower fourth, the posterior218 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. wall of the. sheath terminates in a thin curved margin, the apo- neuroses of the three muscles passing altogether in front of the rectus. The next two muscles can he examined only when the viscera of the abdomen are removed. To see the quadratus lumborum, it is also necessary to divide and draw aside the psoas muscle and the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis. The Quadhatus lumborum muscle is concealed from view bv the^ anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, which is inserted into the bases of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrm. When this lamella is divided, the muscle will be seen arisincf from the last rib, and from the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebra. It is niserted into the crest of the ilium and ilio-lumbar ligament. If the muscle be cut across or removed, the middle lamella of the transversalis will be seen attached to the apices of the transverse processes ; the quadratus being enclosed between the two lamellm as in a sheath. Relations. — Enclosed in the sheath formed by the transversalis muscle, it is. in relation, in front, with the kidney, the colon, the psoas magnus, and the diaphragm. Behind, but also separated by its sheath, with the erector spinse. The Psoas parvus ames from the tendinous arches and iittervertc- bral substance of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, and termi- nates in a long slender tendon which expands interiorly and is inserted into the ilio-pectineal line and eminence. The tendon is continuous by its outer border with the iliac fascia. Relations.—It rests upon the psoas magnus, and is covered in by the peritoneum; superiorly it passes beneath the ligamentum arcuatum of the diaphragm. It is occasionally wanting. Diaphragm.—To obtain a good view of this important inspirator}' muscle, the peritoneum should be dissected from its under surface. It is the muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, and is com- posed of two portions, a greater and a lesser muscle. The greater muscle arises from the ensiform cartilage; from the inner surfaces of the six inferior ribs, indigitating with the transversalis ; and from the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum. From these points, which form the internal circumference of the trunk, the fibres converge and are inserted into the central tendon. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is the upper border of the an- terior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis : it arches across the origin of the quadratus lumborum muscle, and is attached by one extremity to the base of the transverse process o? the first lumbar vertebra, and by the other to the apex and lower margin of the last rib. The ligamentum arcuatum internum, or 2}roprium, is a tendinous arch thrown across the psoas magnus muscle as it emerges from the chest. It is attached by one extremity to the base of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and by the other is continuous•219 DIAPHRAGM. * The under or abdominal side of the diaphragm. 1. 2. 3.

Between the sides of the ensiform cartilage and the cartilages of the adjoining ribs, is a small triangular space where the muscular fibres of the diaphragm are deficient. This space is closed only by peritoneum on the side of the abdomen, and by pleura within the chest. It is therefore a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen might, by violent exertion, be forced through it, producing phrenic, or diaphragmatic hernia. The lesser muscle of the diaphragm takes its origin from the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae by two tendons. The rights larger and longer than the left, arises from the anterior surface of the bodies of the second, third, and fourth vertebrae ; and the left from the side of the second and third. The tendons form two large fleshy bellies (crura), which ascend to be inserted into the central tendon. The inner fasciculi of the two crura cross each other in front of the aorta, and again diverge to surround the oesophagus, so as to present the appear- ance of a figure of eight. The anterior fasciculus of the decussation is formed by the right crus. The openings in the diaphragm are three : one, quadrilateral, in the tendinous centre, at the union of the right and middle leaflets, for the passage of the inferior vena cava ; a muscular opening of an elliptic shape formed by the two crura, for the transmission of the oesophagus and pneumogaslric nerves ; and a third, the aortic, which is formed by a tendinous arch thrown from the tendon of one crus to that of the other, beneath which pass the aorta, the right vena azygos, and the thoracic duct. The great splanchnic nerves pass through openings in the lesser muscle on each side, and the lesser splanchnic nerves be- tween the fibres which arise from the ligamentum arcuatum internum. Relations.—By its superior surface with the pleurae, the pericar- dium, the heart, and the lungs. Bj"^ its inferior surface with the peri- toneum ; on the left with the stomach and spleen ; on the right Avith the convexity of the liver; and behind with the kidneys, the supra- renal capsules, the duodenum, and the solar plexus. By its circum- ference with the ribs and intercostal muscles, and with the vertebral column. Actions.—The external oblique muscle, acting singly, would draw the thorax towards the pelvis, and twist the body to the opposite side. Both muscles, acting together, would flex the thorax directly on the pelvis. The internal oblique of one side draws the chest downwards and outwards: both together bend it directly forwards. Either transversalis muscle, acting singly, will diminish the size of the abdo- men on its own side, and both together will constrict the entire cylinder of the cavity. The recti muscles, assisted by the pyramidales, flex the thorax upon the chest, and, through the medium of the lineae transversse, are enabled to act when their sheath is curved inwards by the action of the transversales. The pyramidales are tensors of the linea alba. The abdominal are expiratory muscles, and the chief agents ofMUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. 221 expulsion ; by their action the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the urine from the bladder, the faeces from the rectum, the bile from the gall-bladder, the ingesta from the stomach and bowels in vomiting, and the mucous and irritating substances from the bronchial tubes, trachea, and nasal passages, during coughing and sneezing. To produce these efforts they all act together. Their violent and continued action pro- duces hernia ; and, acting spasmodically, they may occasion rupture of the viscera. The quadratus lumborum draws the last rib down- wards, and is an expiratory muscle ; it also serves to bend the verte- bral column to one or the other side. The psoas parvus is a tensor of the iliac fascia, and, taking its fixed origin from below, it may as- sist in flexing the vertebral column forwards. The diaphragm is an inspiratory muscle, and the sole agent in tranquil inspiration. When in action, the muscle is drawn downwards, its plane being rendered ob- lique from the level of the ensiform cartilage, to that of the upper lumbar vertebra. During relaxation it is convex, and encroaches consider- ably on the cavity of the chest, particularly at the sides, where it corresponds with the lungs. It assists the abdominal muscles power- fully in expulsion, every act of that kind being preceded or accom- panied by a deep inspiration. Spasmodic action of the diaphragm produces hiccough and sobbing, and its rapid alternation of contraction and relaxation, combined with larjmgeal and facial movements, laugh- ing and crj'ing. MUSCLES OF THE PEEINEUM. The muscles of the perineum are situated in the outlet of the pelvis, and consist of two groups, one of which belongs especially to the organs of generation and urethra, the other to the termination of the alimentary' canal. To these may be added the only pair of muscles which is proper to the pelvis, the coccygei. The muscles of the peri- neal region in the male, are the Accelerator urinm. Erector penis. Compressor urethrae, Transversus perinei, Sphincter ani. Levator ani, Coccygeus. Dissection.—To dissect the perineum, the subject should be fixed : in the position for lithotomy, that is, the hands should be bound to t the soles of the feet, and the knees kept apart. An easier plan is the ' drawing of the feet upwards by means of a cord passed through a hook in the ceiling. Both of these plans of preparation have for their object the full exposure of the perineum. And as this is a dissection222 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUJI. which demands some degree of delicacy and nice manipulation, a strong light should he thrown upon the part. Having fixed the subject, and drawn the scrotum upwards by means of a string or hook, carry an incision from the base of the scrotum along the ramus of the pubes and ischium and tuberosity of the ischium, to a point parallel with the apex of the coccyx ; then describe a curve over the coccyx to the same point on the opposite side, and continue the incision onwards along the opposite tuberosity, and along the ramus of the ischium and of the pubes, to the opposite side of the scrotum, where the two extremities may be connected by a transverse incision. This incision will com- pletely surround the perineum, following verj' nearly the outline of its boundaries. Now let the student dissect off the integument carefully from the whole of the included space, and he will expose the fatty areolar structure of the common superficial fascia, which exactly re- sembles the superficial fascia in every other situation. The common superficial fascia is then to be removed to the same extent, exposing the superficial perineal fascia. This layer is also to be turned aside, when the muscles of the genital region of the perineum will be brought into view. The Accelekatores urin.5E (bulbo-cavemosus) arise from a ten- dinous point in the centre of the perineum and from the fibrous raphe of the two muscles. From these origins the fibres diverge, like the plumes of a pen ; the posterior fibres to be inserted into the ramus of the pubes and ischium ; the middle to encircle the corpus spongiosum, and meet upon its upper side ; and the anterior to spread out upon the corpus cavernosum on each side, and be inserted, partly into its fibrous stnicture, and partly into the fascia of the penis. The poste- rior and middle insertions of these muscles are best seen, bj-^ carefully raising one muscle from the corpus spongiosum and tracing its fibres. Relations.—By their superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, the dartos, the superficial vessels and nerves of the perineum, and on each side with the erector penis. By their deep surface with the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra. The Erector penis (ischio-cavemosus) arises from the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and curves around the root of the penis, to be inserted into the upper surface of the corpus cavernosum, where it is continuous with a strong fascia which covers the dorsum of the organ, the fascia penis. Relations.—By its superficial srirface with the superficial perineal fascia, the dartos, and the superficial perineal vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the corpus cavernosum penis. The Compressor urethra (Wilson’s tund Guthrie’s muscles), consists of two portions ; one of which is transverse in its direction, and passes inwards, to embrace the membranous urethra ; the other is perpendicular., and descends from the pubes. The transverse portion, particularly described by Mr. Guthrie, arises by a naiTow tendinous point, from the upper part of the ramus of the ischium, on each side, and divides into two fasciculi, which pass inwards and slightly up-223 COMPRESSOR URETHRiE, ■wards, and embrace the membranous portion of the urethra and Cow- per’s glands. As they pass towards the lu-ethra, they spread out and become fan-shaped, and are inseiied into a tendinous raphe upon the upper and lower siu’faces of the urethra, extending from the apex of Fiff. 97.' • the prostate gland, to which they are attached posteriorly, to the bulbous portion of the urethra, with which they are connected in front. ' When seen from above, these portions resemble two fans, connected by their expanded border along the middle line of the membranous urethra, from the prostate to the bulbous portion of the urethra. The ' same appearance is obtained by viewing them from below. The perpendicular porlionf described by Mr. Wilson, arises by two ■ tendinous points from the inner surface of the arch of the pubes, on • each side of, and close to, the symphysis. The tendinous origins soon 1 become muscular, and descend perpendicularly, to be inserted into the • The muscles of the perineum. 1 The acceleratores uriiife muscles; the ^ figure rests upon the corpus spongiosum penis. 2.

The compressor urethrae may be considered either as two symme- trical muscles meeting at the raphe, or as a single muscle: I have adopted the latter course in the above description, as appearing to me the more consistent with the general connections of the muscle, and with its actions. The Transversus perinei amesfrom the tuberosity of the ischium on each side, and is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perineum.* Relations.—By its superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, and superficial perineal artery. By its deep surface with the deep perineal fascia, and internal pudic artery and veins. Bj’’ its/»os- terior border it is in relation with that portion of the superficial peri- neal fascia which passes up to become continuous with the deep fascia. To dissect the compressor urethra, the whole of the preceding muscles should be removed, so as to render the glistening surface of the deep perineal fascia quite apparent. The anterior layer of this fascia should then be carefully dissected away, and the corpus spongiosum penis divided through its middle, separated from the corpus cavemo- sum, and drawn forwards, in order to put on the stretch the mem- branous portion of the urethra, upon which the muscle is spread out. The muscle is, however, better seen in a dissection made from within the pelvis, after having turned down the bladder from its attachment to the os pubis, and removed a plexus of veins and the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. The Sphincter ani is a thin and elliptical plane of muscle closelj- adherent to the integument, and surrounding the opening of the anus. It arises posteriorly in the superficial fascia around the coccyx, and by a fibrous raphe from the apex of that bone ; and is imerted anteriorly into the tendinous centre of the perineum, and into the raph6 of the integument, nearly as far forwards as the commencement of the scrotum. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument. By its deep surface with the internal sphincter, the levator ani, the areolar tissue and fat in the ischio-rectal fossa, and in front ivith the superfi- cial perineal fascia. The Sphincter ani internus is a muscidar ring embracing the extremity of the intestine, and formed by an aggregation of the cir- cular muscular fibres of the rectum. * I have twice dissected a perineum in which the transversus perinei was of large size, and spread out as it approached the middle line so as to become fan- shaped. The posterior fibres were continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side; but the anterior were prolonged forwards upon the bulb and corpus spongiosum of the urethra as far as the middie of the penis, forming a broad layer which usurped the place and office of the accelerator urinas.LEVATOR ANI.—COCCYGEUS. 225 Part of the levator ani may be seen during the dissection of the anal portion of the perineum by removing the fat which surrounds the termination of the rectum in the ischio-rectal fossa. But, to study the entire muscle, a lateral section of the pelvis must be made by sawing through the pubes a little to one side of the symphysis, separating the bones behind at the sacro-iliac symphysis, !vnd turning down the blad- der and rectum. The pelvic fascia is then to be carefully raised, be- ginning at the base of the bladder and proceeding upwards, imtil the whole extent of the muscle is exposed. The Levator ani is a thin plane of muscular fibres, situated on each side of the pelvis. The muscle arises from the inner surface of the os pubis, fi.-om the spine of the ischium, and, between those points, from the angle of division between the obturator and the pelvic fascia. Its fibres descend to be inserted into the extremity of the coccyx, into a fibrous raphd in front of that bone, into the lower part of the rectum, base of the bladder, and prostate gland. In the female this muscle is inserted into the coccyx and fibrous raphe, lower part of the rectum, and vagina. Relations.—By its eatemal ov perineal surface., with a thin layer of fascia, by which, and by the obturator fascia, it is separated from the obturator internus muscle ; with the fat in the ischio-rectal fossa, the deep perineal fascia, the sphincter ani, and posteriorly with the gluteus maximus. By its internal or pelvic surface with the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the viscera of the pelvis and from the perito- neum. The CoccYGEUS muscle is a tendino-muscular layer of a triangular form. It arises from the spine of the ischium, and is inserted into the side of the coccyx and lower part of the sacrum. Relations.—By its internal or pelvic surface with the rectum; by its code) nal surface with the lesser and greater sacro-ischiatic ligaments. Female Perineum.—The muscles of the perineum in the female are the same as in the male, and have received analogous names. They are smaller in size, and are modified to suit the different form of the organs ; they are— Constrictor vaginae. Erector clitoridis, Transversus perinei, Compressor urethrae, Sphincter ani. Levator ani, Coccygeus. The Constrictor vaginae is analogous to the acceleratores urinm; it is I continuous posteriorly witli the sphincter ani, interlacing with its fibres, and is inserted anteriorly into the sides of the corpora cavernosa, and i fascia of the clitoris.226 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. The Tnmsversus perinei is inserted into the side of the constrictor vaginiE, and the levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar in their attachments to those in the male. Actions.—The acceleratores urinm being continuous at the middle line, and attached on each side to the hone, by means of their posterior fibres will support the bulbous portion of the urethra, and acting sud- denly, will propel the semen, or the last drops of urine from the canal. The posterior and middle fibres, according to Krause,* contribute to- wards the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by producing compres- sion upon the venous structure of the bulb ; and the anterior fibres, according to Tyrrell,t assist in the erection of the entire organ by com- pressing the vena dorsalis, by means of their insertion into the fascia penis. The erector penis becomes entitled to its name from spreading out upon the dorsum of the organ into a membranous expansion (fascia penis), which, according to Krause, compresses the dorsal vein during the action of the muscle, and especially after the erection of the organ has commenced. The transverse muscles serve to steady the tendinous centre, that the muscles attached to it may obtain a firm point of support. According to Cruveilhier, they draw the anus backwards during the expulsion of the faeces, and antagonise the levatores ani which carry the anus forwards. The compressor urethrae, taking its fixed point from the ramus of the ischium at each side, can, says Mr. Guthrie, “ compress the urethra so as to close it ; I conceive completely, after the manner of a sphincter.” The transverse portion will also have a tendency to draw the urethra downwards, whilst the perpendicular portion will draw it upwards towards the os pubis. The inferior fasciculus of the transverse muscle, enclosing Cowper's glands, will assist those bodies in evacuating their secretion. The external sphincter, being a cutaneous muscle, contracts the integument around the anus, and by its attachment to the tendinous centre and to the point of the coccyx, assists the levator ani in giving support to the opening during expulsive efforts. The internal sphincter contracts the extremity of the cylinder of the intestine. The use of the levator ani is expressed in its name. It is the antagonist of the diaphragm and the rest of the expulsory muscles, and serves to support the rectum and vagina during their expulsive efforts. The levator ani acts in unison with the diaphragm, and rises and falls like that muscle in forcible respiration. Yielding to the propulsive action of the abdo- minal muscles, it enables the outlet of the pelvis to bear a greater force than a resisting structure, and on the lemission of such action it restores the perineum to its original form. The coccygei muscles restore the coccyx to its natural position, after it has been pressed backwards during defsecation or during parturition. * Muller, Archiv fiir Anatoinie, Physiologie, ifec. 1837. t Lectures in the College of Surgeons. 1839.227 MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY.

Palmar Rpgion. Lumbricales, Interossei palmares, Interossei dorsales. Anterior Thoracic Region. Pectoralis major, Pectoralis minor, Subclavius. Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of the clavicle, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process; a second along the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, from the lower end of the sternum to the insertion of its tendon into the humerus ; and con- nect the two by a third, carried longitudinally along the middle of the sternum. The integument and superficial fascia are to be dissected to- gether from off the fibres of the muscle, and always in the direction of their course. For this purpose the dissector, if he have the right arm, will commence with the lower angle of the flap ; if the left, with the upper angle. He will thus expose the pectoralis major muscle in its whole extent. The Pector.ylis major muscle aiises from the sternal two-thirds of the clavicle, from one-half the breadth of the sternum its whole length, from the cartilages of all the true ribs, excepting the first and last, and from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. It is inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. That portion of the muscle which arises from the clavicle, is sepa- rated from that connected with the sternum by a distinct areolar in- terspace; hence we speak of the clavicular portion and sternal portion of the pectoralis major. The fibres from this very extensive origin converge towards a-narrow insertion, giving the muscle a radiated ap- pearance. But there is a peculiarity about the formation of its tendon which must be carefully noted. The whole of the lower border is folded inwards upon the upper portion, so that the tendon is doubled upon itself. Another peculiarity results from this arrangement: the fibres of the upper portion of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the bicipital ridge ; and those of the lower portion, into the upper part.•229 PKCTORALIS —SUBCLAVIUS. Rt'lations.—By its eaiernal mvface with the fibres of origin of the platysma myoides, the mainmar}'- gland, the superficial fascia and inte- gument. By its internal surface, on the thorax, with the clavicle, the sternum, the costal csirtilages, intercostal muscles, subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus magmis; in the axilla, with the axillar}^ vessels and glands. By its codemal border with the deltoid, from which it is separated above by an areolar interspace lodging the cephalic vein and the descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its loiver border forms the anterior boundary of the axillary space. The pectoralis major is now to be removed by dividing its fibres along the lower border of the clavicle, and then carrying the incision perpendicularly downwards, parallel to the sternum, and at about three inches from its border. Divide some loose areolar tissue, and several small branches of the thoracic arteries, and reflect the muscle outwards. AVe thus bring into view a region of considerable interest, in the mid- dle of which is situated the pectoralis minor. The Pectoralis minor arises by three digitations from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and is inserted into the anterior border of the coracoid process of the scapula by a broad tendon. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pectoralis major and superior thoracic vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the ribs, the intercostal muscles, serratus raagnus, axillary space, and axillary vessels and nerves. Its upper border forms the lower boun- dary of a triangular space bounded above by the costo-coracoid mem- brane, and internally by the ribs. In this space are found the axillary vessels and nerves, and in it the subclavian artery may be tied below the clavicle. The Subclavius muscle arises by a round tendon from the cartilage of the first rib, and is inserted into the under surface of the clavicle. This muscle is concealed by the costo-coracoid membrane, an extension of the deep cervical fascia, by which it is invested. Relations.—By its upper surface with the clavicle. By the loicer with the subclavian artery and vein and brachial plexus, which sepa- rate it from the first rib. In front with the pectoralis major, the costo- coracoid membrane being interposed. Actions.—The pectoralis major draws the arm against the thorax, while its upper fibres assist the upper part of the trapezius in raising the shoulder, as in supporting weights. The lower fibres depress the shoulder with the aid of the latissimus dorsi. Taking its fixed point from the shoulder, the pectoralis major assists the pectoralis minor, subclavius, and serratus magnus, in drawing up and expanding the chest. The pectoralis minor, in addition to this action, draws upon the coracoid process, and assists in rotating the scapula upon the chest. The subclavius draws the clavicle downwards and forwards, and thereby assists in steadying the shoulder. All the muscles of this group are agents in forced respiration, but are incapable of acting until the shoulders are fixed.■230 LATERAL THORACIC REGION. Lateral Thoracic Region. Serratus magnus. The Serratus magnus (serratus, indented like the edge of a saw,) arises by fleshy serrations from the nine upper ribs excepting the first, and extends backwards upon the side of the chest, to be inserted into the whole length of the base of the scapula upon its anterior aspect. In structure the muscle is composed of three portions, a superior por- tion formed by two serrations attached to the second rib, and inserted into the inner surface of the superior angle of the scapula, a middle portion composed of the serrations connected with the third and fourth ribs, and inserted into the greater part of the posterior border, and an inferior portion consisting of the last five serrations which indigitate with the obliquus extemus and form a thick muscular fasciculus which is inserted into the scapula near its inferior angle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pectoralis major and minor, the subscapularis, and the axillary vessels and nerves. B3' its deep surface with the ribs and intercostal muscles, to which it is con- nected bj’' an extremely loose areolar tissue. Actions.—The serratus magnus is the great external inspirator}" muscle, raising the ribs when the shoulders are fixed, and thereby in- creasing the cavity of the chest. Acting upon the scapula it draws the shoulder forwards, as we see to be the case in diseased lungs, where the chest has become almost fixed from apprehension of the expanding action of the respiratory muscles. Anterior Scapular Region. Subscapularis. The Subscapularis muscle arises from the whole of the under sur- face of the scapula excepting the superior and inferior angle, and ter- minates by a broad and thick tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. The substance of the muscle is traversed by several intersecting membranous layers from which muscular fibres arise, the intersections being attached to the ridges on the sur&ce of the scapula. Its tendon forms part of the capsule of the joint, glides over a large bursa which separates it from the base of the coracoid process, and is lined by a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the articulation. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the serratus magnus, coraco- brachialis, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the scapula, the subscapular vessels and nerves, and the shoulder joint. Action.—It rotates the head of the humerus inwards, and is a powerful defence to the joint. When the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards.POSTERIOR SCAPULAR REGIOX. 231 Posterior Scapular Peyton. Supm-spinatus, Teres minor, Infei-spiuatus, Teres major. The SuPRA-SPiNATUS muscle (supra, above; spina, the spine) arises from the whole of the supra-spinous fossa, and is inserted into the uppermost depression on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle cannot well be seen until the acromion process is removed. Relations.—By its upper surface with the trapezius, the clavicle, acromion, and coraco-acromial ligament. From the trapezius it is separated by a strong fascia. By its lower surface with the supra- spinous fossa, the supra-scapular vessels and nerve, and the upper part of the shoulder-joint, forming part of the capsular ligament. The IxFRA-spiNATUS (infra, beneath ; spina, the spine) is covered in by a laj^er of tendinous fascia, which must be removed before the fibres of the muscle can be seen, the deltoid muscle having been pre- viously turned do\vn from its scapular origin. It arises from the whole of the infra-spinous fossa, and from the fascia above-mentioned, and is inserted into the middle depression upon the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Relations.—By \ia posterior surf ace with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, and integument. Bj' its anterior surface with the infra-spinous fossa, superior and dorsal scapular vessels, and shoulder-joint; its tendon being lined by a prolongation from the synovial membrane. By its upper border it is in relation with the spine of the scapula, and by the lotcer mth the teres minor, with which it is closely united. The Teres .minor muscle (teres, round) arises from the middle third of the inferior border of the scapula, and is inserted into the lower de- pression on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The tendons of these three muscles, with that of the subscapularis, are in immediate contact with the shoulder-joint, and fonn part of its ligamentous capsule, thereby preserving the solidity of the articulation. They are there- fore the structures most frequently ruptured in dislocation of the head of the humerus. Relations.—By \isposterior surface with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, and integument. By its anterior surface with the inferior border, and part of the dorsum of the scapula, the dorsalis scapulae vessels, scapular head of the triceps, and shoulder-joint. By its upper border with the infra-spinatus; and by the lower with the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and long head of the triceps. The Teres .major muscle arises from the lower third of the inferior border of the scapula, encroaching a little on its dorsal aspect, and is inserted into the posterior bicipital ridge. Its tendon lies immediately behind that of the latissimus dorsi, from which it is separated by a synovial membrane. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the latissimus dorsi, sea-ACROMIAL REGION. •232 pillar head of the triceps and inteppiment. By its anterior surface with the suhscapularis, latissimus dorsi, coraco-hrachialis, short head of the biceps, axillary vessels, and branches of the brachial plexus. By its upper border it is in relation with the teres minor, from which it is separated by the scapular head of the triceps, and by the lower it forms with the latissimus dorsi the lower and posterior border of the axilla. A large triangular space exists between the two teres muscles, which is divided into two minor spaces by the long head of the triceps. Actions.—The supra-spinatus raises the arm from the side; but only feebly, from the disadvantageous direction of its force. The infra-spinatus and teres minor are rotators of the head of the humerus outwards. The most important use of these three muscles is the pro- tection of the joint, and defence against displacement of the head of the humerus, in which action they co-operate with the suhscapularis. The teres major combines, with the latissimus dorsi, in rotating the arm inwards, and at the same time carrying it towards the side, and somewhat backwards. Acromial Region. Deltoid. The convexity of the shoulder is formed by a large triangular muscle, the deltoid (A, delta; sTSof, resemblance), which arises from the outer third of the clavicle, from the acromion process,and from the whole length of the spine of the scapula. The fibres from this broad origin converge to the middle of the outer side of the humerus, where they are inserted into a rough triangular elevation. This muscle is remark- able for its coarse texture, and for its numerous tendinous intersections from which muscular fibres arise. The deltoid muscle may be cut away from its origin, and turned down, for the purpose of bringing i into view the muscles and tendons placed immediately around the shoulder-joint. In so doing, a large bursa will be seen between the under surface of the muscle and the head of the humerus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a thin aponeurotic fascia, a few fibres of the platysma myoides, the superficial fascia and in- tegument. By its deep surface with the shoulder-joint [from which it is separated by a thin tendinous fascia and by a synodal bursa], with the coraco-acromial ligament, coracoid process, pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, both heads of the biceps, tendon of the pectoralis major, tendon of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, teres major, scapular and external head of the triceps, the circumflex vessels anterior and posterior, and humerus. By its anterior border with the external border of the pectoralis major, from v/hich it is ] separated by an areolar interspace, lodging the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its posterior JLkimi233 anterior humeral region. border is thin and tendinous above, where it is connected with the aponeurotic covering of the infra-spinatus muscle, and thick below. Actions.—The deltoid is the elevator muscle of the arm in a direct line, and, by means of its extensive origin, it can carry the arm forwards or backwards so as to range with the hand a considerable segment of a large circle. The arm, raised by the deltoid, is a good illustration of a lever of the third power, so common in the animal machine, by pig, gg.* which velocity is gained at the ex- pense of power. In this lever, the weight (hand) is at one extremity, the fulcrum (the glenoid cavitj') at the opposite end, and the power (the insertion of the muscle) be- tween the two, but nearer the ful- crum than the weight. Anterior Humeral Region. Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, Brachialis anticus. Dissection. — These muscles are exposed, on the removal of the integument and fascia from the an- terior half of the upper arm, and the clearing away of the areolar tissue. The Coraco-brachialis,aname composed of its points of origin and insertion, arises from the coracoid process in common with the short head of the biceps ; and is inserted into a rough line on the inner side of the middle of the humerus. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the deltoid, and pectoralis : major.

By its internal border witli the axillary and brachial vessels and nerves, particularly with the median and external cutaneous nerve, by the latter of which it is pierced. By the external border with the short head of the biceps and brachialis anticus. The Biceps (bis—x.t(pa,Xai two heads) arises by two tendons, one, the sho7-t head, from the coracoid process in common with the coraco- brachialis ; the other, the long head, from the upper part of the glenoid cavity. The muscle is inserted by a rounded tendon, into the tuber- cle of the radius. The long head, a long slender tendon, passes through the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint enclosed in a sheath of the synovial membrane; after leaving the cavity of the joint, it is lodged in the deep groove that separates the two tubero- sities of the humerus, the bicipital groove. A small synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion, and the tubercle of the radius. At the bend of the elbow, the tendon of the biceps gives off from its inner side a broad tendinous band, which protects the brachial artery, and is continuous with the fascia of the fore-arm. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deltoid, pectoralis major, superficial and deep fascia and integument. By its posterior surface the short head rests upon the subscapularis, from which it is separated by a bursa. In the rest of its extent the muscle is in re- lation with the humerus, the teres major, latissimus dorsi, and brachi- alis anticus ; from the latter it is separated by the external cutaneous nerve. By its inner border with the coraco-brachialis, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve ; the brachial vessels crossing its tendon at the bend of the elbow. By its outer border with the deltoid and supinator longus. The Brachialis anticus is a broad muscle covering the whole of the anterior surface of the lower part of the humerus; it arises by two fleshy serrations from the depressions on either side of the insertion of the deltoid, from the anterior surface of the humerus, and from the intermuscular septa attached to the condyloid ridges. Its fibres con- verge to be insei’ted into the coronoid process of the ulna. Relations.—By its anterior surf ace wiih. the biceps, external cuta- ' neous nerve, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve. By its | posterior surface with the humerus, anterior ligament of the elbow- f joint, and intermuscular aponeurosis. The latter separates it from the * triceps.

By its internal border with the intermuscular aponeurosis, (which separates it from the triceps and ulnar nerve,) and with the pronator radii teres. Actions.—The coraco-brachialis draws the humerus inwards, and assists in flexing it upon the scapula. The biceps and brachialis anticus are flexors of the fore-arm, and the former a supinator. The brachialis anticus is a powerful protection to the elbow-joint.235 POSTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. Posterior Humeral Region. Triceps extensor cubiti. Dissection.—Remove the integument and fascia from the posterior aspect of the upper arm. The Triceps Kt(paXai, three heads,) arises by three heads. Considered in relation to their length, these heads have been named long, short, and middle; and in re- ference to their position, internal. Fig. 99.* external, and middle ; the term middle, in the former case, referring to the external head, and in the latter case to the long head. This has given rise to much confusion and misunderstanding. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the de- signations derived from their rela- tions. The external head arises from the humerus, commencing im- mediately below the insertion of the teres minor, and from the intermus- cular septum attached to the exter- nal condyloid ridge. The internal head (short) arises from the hume- rus, commencing immediately below the insertion of the teres major, and from the intermuscular septum attached to the internal condyloid ridge. The scapular head (long) lies between the two others, and arises from the upper third of the inferior border of the scapula. The ; three heads unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted by an apo- neurotic tendon into the olecranon j process of the ulna; a small bursa is situated between this tendon and the upper part of the olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and : major, and divides the triangular 'Space between those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The triangular space is bounded : by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps ; it • A posterior view of the upper arm, shewing the triceps muscle. 1. Its ex- ternal head. 2.

Disseclion.—These muscles tare broiifrht into view by making an in- cision through the integument along the middle line of the fore-arm, crossing each extremity by a transverse incision, and turning aside the flaps. The superficial and deep fascia are then to be removed. The Pronator r.a.dii teres arises by two heads ; one from tlie inner condyle of the humerus, fiiscia of the fore-arm, and intermuscular aponeurosis; the other, from the coronoid process of the ulna; the me- dian nerve passing between them. Its tendon is flat, and is inseiied into the middle third of the oblique ridge of the radius. The two ■ heads of this muscle are best examined by cutting through that which jarises from the inner condyle, and turning it aside. The second head •• will then be seen with the median nerve lying across it. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the fascia of the fore-arm, : the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, radial artery and veins, and radial nerve. By its posterior surface with the ibrachialis anticus, flexor sublimis digitorum, the ulnar artery and ■veins, and the median nerve after it has passed between the two 'heads of the muscle. By its upper border it forms the inner boundary of the triangular space, in which the termination of the brachial arterj' ; is situated. By its loicer border it is in relation with the flexor carpi •radialis. The Flexor carpi radialis arises from the inner condyle and from the intermuscular fascia. Its tendon passes tlirough a groove formed by the scaphoid bone and trapezium, to be inserted into the base of the metacai-pal bone of the index finger. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the fascia of the fore-arm, and at the wrist with the tendinous canal through which its tendon 'Oasses. By its posterior surface with the flexor sublimis digitorum, dexor longus pollicis, wrist-joint, and groove in the scaphoid and tra- aezium bones. By its outer border witli the pronator radii teres, and •adial artery and veins. By its mner border with the palmaris longus. The tendon is surrounded by a synovial membrane where it plays •hrough the tendinous canal of the wrist. The Palmaris longus is a small muscle which arises from the nner condyle, and from the intermuscular fascia. It is inserted into I he annular ligament and palmar fascia. Occasionally this muscle is vanting. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the fascia of the fore-arm. !Iy the posterior surface \vith the flexor sublimis digitorum ; to the ' rternal side by tlie flexor carpi radialis ; and to the internal side by i he fle.xor carpi ulnaris. Cut the flexor cai-pi radialis and palmaris longus from their origins, r. 1 order to obtain a good view of the whole extent of origin of the I exor sublimis digitorum. The Flexor sublimis digitorum (perforatus) arises from the iner condyle, internal lateral ligament, coronoid process of the ulna, nd oblique line of the radius. The median nerve and ulnar artery mss between its origins. It divides into four tendons, which passANTERIOR HRACHIAL REGION. 238 beneath the annular ligament into the palm of the hand, and are inserted into the base of the second phalanges of the fingers, splitting at their terminations to give passage to the tendons of the deep flexors; thence its designation, perforatus. In the thecm of the fingers several small tendinous fasciculi are generally found, which pass between the phalanges and the edges of the tendons; these have been termed the vincula accessoria. Relations.—In the fore-arm. By its anterior surface with the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the deep fascia. By its posterior surface with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, ulnar artery, veins, and nerve, and median nerve. This muscle frequently sends a fasciculus to the flexor longus pollicis or flexor profundus. In the hand; its tendons, after passing beneath the annular ligament, are in relation superficially with the superficial palmar arch, and palmar fascia; and deeply with the tendons of the deep flexor and lumbricales. The Flexor carpi ulnaris arises by two heads, one from the inner condyle, the other from the olecranon and upper two-thirds of the inner border of the ulna. Its tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone, and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the fascia of the fore-arm, with which it is closely united superiorly. By its posterior surface with the flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor profundus, pronator quadra- tus, and ulnar artery, veins, and nerve. By its radial border with the palmaris longus, and in the lower third of the fore-arm with the ulnar vessels and nerve. The ulnar nerve, and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery, pass between its two heads of origin. Deep layer. Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis. Pronator quadratus. Dissection.—This group is brought into view by removing the flexor sublimis, and drawing aside the pronator radii teres. The Flexor profundus digitorum (perforans) arises from the upper two-thirds of the ulna and part of the interosseous membrane, and terminates in four tendons, which pass beneath the annular liga- ment, and between the two slips of the tendons of the flexor sublimis (hence its designation, perforans), to be inserted into the base of the last phalanges. The tendon of the index finger is always distinct from the rest, the other three tendons being more or less intimately connected by areolar' tissue and tendinous slips. Four little muscular fasciculi, called lumJrricales, are connected with the tendons of this muscle in the palm. They will be described with the muscles of the hand. Relations.—In the fore-arm.

R242 POSTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. supinator brevis, tendon of the pronator radii teres, radius, and wrist- joint. By its ulnar border with the extensor communis digitorum. The Extensor communis digitorum arises from the external condyle, and intermuscular fascia; and divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers. At the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation each tendon becomes narrow and thick, and sends a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint. It then spreads out, and receiving the tendon of the lumbricalis and some tendinous fasciculi from the interossei, forms a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole of the posterior aspect of the finger. At the first phalangeal joint the aponeurosis divides into three slips. The middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral portions are continued onwards on each side of the joint, to be inserted into the last. Little oblique tendinous slips connect the tendons of the middle, ring, and little finger as they cross the back of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia of the fore-arm and back of the hand, and with the posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii, extensor secundi intemodii, extensor indicis, posterior interosseous artery and nerve, Munst-joint, metacarpal bones and interossei muscles, and phalanges. By its radial border with the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. By the ul7iar border with the extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi idnaris. The Extensor minimi digiti (auricularis) is- an off-set fi-om the extensor communis, with which it is connected by means of a tendi- nous slip. Passing down to the inferior extremity of the ulna it tra- verses a distinct fibrous sheath, and at the metacarpo-phalangeal articu- lation unites with the tendon derived from the common extensor. The common tendon then spreads out into a broad expansion which divides into three slips to be inserted as in the other fingers into the last two phalanges. It is to this muscle that the little finger owes its power of separate extension; and from being called into action when the point of the finger is introduced into the meatus of the ear, for the purpose of removing unpleasant sensations or producing titillatipn, the muscle was called by the old writers “ auricidaris.” The Extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the external condyle and from the upper two-thirds of the border of the ulna. Its tendon passes through the posterior groove in the lower extremity of the ulna, to be insert^ into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia of the fore-arm, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supi- nator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor secundi inter- nodii, extensor indicis, ulna, and wrist-joint.

The supinator longus and brevis effect the supination of the fore-arm, and antagonize the two pronators. The extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and extensor carpi ulnaris, extend the wrist in opposition to the two flexors of the carpus. The extensor communis digitorum restores the fingers to the straight position after they have been flexed by the two flexors, sublimis and profundus. The extensor ossis meta- carpi, primi internodii, and secundi intemodii pollicis, are the especial extensors of the thumb, and serve to balance the actions of the flexor ossis metacarpi, flexor brevis, and flexor longus pollicis. The extensor indicis gives the character of extension to the index finger, and is hence named “indicator,” and the extensor minimi digit! supplies that finger with the power of exercising a distinct extension. MUSCLES OF THE HAND. Radial or Thenar Region. Abductor pollicis, Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens), Flexor brevis pollicis, Adductor pollicis. Dissection.—The hand is best dissected by making an incision along the middle of the palm, from the wrist to the bases of the fingers, and crossing it at each extremity by a transverse incision, then turning aside the flaps of integument. For exposing the muscles of the radial region, the removal of the integument and fascia on the radial side will be sufficient. The Abductor pollicis is a small, thin muscle, which arises from the scaphoid bone and annular ligament. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external portion of the palmar fascia. By its deep surface with the flexor ossis metacarpi. On its inner side it is separated by a narrow areolar interspace from the flexor brevis pollicis. This muscle must be divided from its origin, and turned upwards, in order to see the next. The Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens pollicis) arises from the • trapezium and annular ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the abductor pollicis. By its deep surface with the trapezio-metacarpal articulation and with • the metacarpal bone. Internally with the flexor brevis pollicis. The flexor ossis metacarpi may now be divided from its origin and ; turned aside, in order to shew the next muscle. The Flexor brevis pollicis consists of two portions, between which lies the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The external portion•246 MUSCLES OP THE HAND, arises from the trapezium and annular ligament ; the internal portion from the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserU:d into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, liaving a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to protect the joint.

N Dissection.—Turn aside the ulnar flap of integument the palm of ' the hand ; in doing this, a small subcutaneous muscle, the palmaris brevis, will be exposed. After examining this muscle, remove it with the deep fascia, in order to bring into view the muscles of the little finger. The Palmaris brevis is a thin plane of muscular fibres which M ' arises from the annular bgament and palmar fascia, and passes trans- versely inwards to be inserted into the integument on the inner border :of the hand.

Lumbricales, Interossei palmares, Interossei dorsales. The Lumbricales, four in number, are accessories to the deep flexor muscle. They arise from the tendons of the deep flexor ; the first and second from the palmar side, the third from the ulnar, and the fourth from the radial side ; and are inserted into the aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendons on the radial side of the fingers. The third, or that of the tendon of the ring finger, sometimes bifur- cates, otherwise it is inserted wholly into the extensor tendon of the middle finger. Relations.—In the palm of the hand with the flexor tendons; at their insertion with the tendons of the interossei and the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. The Palmar interossei, three in number, are placed upon the metacarpal bones, rather than between them. They arise from the base of the metacarpal bone of one finger, and are inserted into the base of the first phalanx and aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendon of the same finger. The first belongs to the index finger; the second, to the ring finger; and the third, to the little finger; the middle finger being omitted. Relations.—By their palmar surface with the flexor tendons and with the deep 'muscles in the palm of the hand. By their dorsal sur- face with the dorsal interossei. On one side with the metacarpal bone, on the other with the corresponding dorsal interosseous. Dorsal interossei.—On turning to the dorsum of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are seen in the four spaces between the metacar- pal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, and arise by two heads, from the adjoining sides of the bases of the metacarpal bones. They are inserted into the base of the first phalanges,'and into the aponeurosis of the extensor tendons. The first is inserted into the index finger, and from its use is called abductor indicis; the second and thu’d are inserted into the middle finger, compensating its exclusion from the palmar group ; the fourth is attached to the ring finger; so that each finger is provided with two interossei, with the exception of the little finger, as may be shewn by means of a table, thus:—DORSAL INTEROSSEI. 249 T , j. ^ one dorsal (abductor rndicis). Index nnqer ; , • ‘ ( one palmar. cuddle finger, two dorsal. T>- j: 1 one dorsal, lunq nnqer 1 , ^ ^ ( one palmar. Liille finger, remaining palmar. Relations.—By their dorsal stcr/ace with a thin aponeurosis which separates them from the tendons on the dorsum of the hand. By their ■palmar surface with the muscles and tendons in the palm of the hand. By one side with the metacarpal bone ; by the other with the corres- ponding palmar interosseous. The abductor indicis is in relation by its palmar surface, with the adductor pollicis, the arteria magna pollicis being interposed. The radial artery passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Actions.—The actions of the muscles of the hand are expressed in their names. Those of the radial region belong to the thumb, and provide for three of its movements, abduction, addvjction, and fieodon. The ulnar group, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger, and the interossei are abductors and adductors of the several fingers. The lumbricales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexors : they were called by the earlier anatomists fidicinii, i. e. fiddlers’ muscles, from an idea that they might effect the fractional movements by which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. In relation to the axis of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are ab- ductors, and the three palmar, adductors. It will therefore be seen that each finger is pro^^ded with its proper adductor and abductor, two flexors, and (with the exception of the middle and ring fingers) two extensors. The thumb has moreover a flexor and extensor of the metacarpal bone ; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone without an extensor. a250 MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY.

Dissection. — The subject being turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the os pubis to support the pelvis, the student commences the dissection of this region, by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous : process ; or vice versa, if he be on the left side. He then makes an incision from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, to the apex of the trochanter major, this marks the upper border of the gluteus ; maximus ; and a third incision from the apex of the coccyx along the : fleshy margin of the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to the outer - side of the thigh, about four inches below the apex of the trochanter rmajor. He then reflects the integument, superficial fascia, and deep tfascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus nmaximus, following rigidly the course of its fibres ; and having ex- pposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and i'Superficial fascia from off the deep fascia which binds down the gluteus rmedius, the other portion of this region. The Gluteus maximus {yXovris, nates) is the thick, fleshy mass (of muscle, of a quadrangular shape, which forms the convexity of the mates. In structure, it is extremely coarse, being made up of large tfibres, which are collected into fasciculi, and these again into distinct nmuscular masses, separated by deep areolar furrows.

The gluteus maximus must be turned down from its origin, in order to bring the next muscles into view. The Gluteus medius is placed in front of, rather than beneath the gluteus maximus ; and is covered in by a process of the deep fascia, which is very thick and dense. It arises from the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for four-fifths of its length, from the surface of hone between that border and the superior curved line on the dorsum ilii, and from the dense fascia above mentioned. Its fibres converge to the outer part of the trochanter major, into which its tendon is inserted.

This muscle should now be removed from its origin and turned down, so as to expose the next which is situated beneath it. The Gluteus minimus is a radiated muscle, arising from the sur- face of the dorsum ilii, between the superior and inferior curved lines ; its fibres converge to the anterior border of the trochanter major, into which it is inserted by means of a rounded tendon. There is no distinct line of separation between the gluteus medius and minimus anteriorly. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus medius, and gluteal vessels.

The PvRiFORMis muscle (pyrum, a pear, i. e. pear-shaped) arises from the anterior surface of the sacrum, by little slips which are inter- posed between the first and fourth anterior sacral foramina, and from the adjoining surface of the ilium.

The gemellus superior is not unfrequently wanting.MUSCLES OF THE GLUTEAL REGION. 254 Relations.—By its superficial surface witli tlie gluteus maximus, the ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the pelvis, and capsule of the hip-joint. The OnTUKATOR INTERNUS arises from the inner surface of the an- terior wall of the pelvis, being attached to the margin of bone around the obturator foramen, and to the obturator membrane. It passes out of the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a flattened tendon into the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The lesser sacro-ischiatic notch, over which this muscle plays as through a pulley, is faced with cai'tilage, and provided with a synovial bursa to facilitate its movements. The tendon of the obturator is accompanied by the two gemelli muscles (hence their names), which are inserted into the sides of the tendon, and appear to be auxiliaries or superadded portions of the obturator internus.

In this region the tendon only of the obturator extemus can be seen, it is situated deeply between the gemellus inferior and the tipper border of the quadratns femoris. To expose this muscle fully, it is necessaiy to dissect it on the anterior part of the thigh, after the re- moval of the pectineus, adductor longus and adductor brevis muscles. The Obturator externus muscle (obturare, to stop up) arises from the obturator membrane, and from the surface of bone immedi- ate!}' surrounding it anteriorly, viz. from the ramus of the os pubis and ischium: its tendon passes behind the neck of the femur, to be in- serted with the external rotator muscles, into the trochanteric fossa of the femur. .

Actions.—The glutei muscles are abductors of the thigh, when they take their fixed point from the pelvis. Taking their fixed point from . the thigh, they stead}*- the pelvis on the head of the femur; this action is peculiarly obvious in standing on one leg; they assist also in carry- ing the leg forward, in progression. The gluteus minimus being at- tached to the anterior border of the trochantet major, rotates the limb slightly inwards. The gluteus medius and maximus, from their inser- tion into the posterior aspect of the bone, rotate the limb outwards ; the latter is, moreover, a tensor of the fascia of the thigh. The other : muscles rotate the limb outwards, everting the knee and foot ; hence ■ they are named external rotators.

Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of Poupart’s ligament, '.from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the spine of t the os pubis; and a second, from the middle of the preceding down •the inner side of the thigh, and across the inner condyle of the femur, to the head of the tibia, where it may be bounded by a transverse in- cision.

This expansion covers in the insertion of the tendons of the gracilis and semitendiuosus muscles.

A perpendicular line, drawn from the middle of the base to the apex of this triangle, immediately overlies the femoral artery with its sheath. The Rectus (straight) muscle is fusiform in its shape and bipenni- fomi in the disposition of its fibres. It arises by two round tendons, one from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, the other from the upper lip of the acetabulum ; and is inserted by a broad and strong tendon, into the upper border of the patella. It is more correct ; to consider the patella as a sesamoid bone, developed within the ; tendon of the rectus; and the ligamentum patellae as the continuation of the tendon to its insertion into the tubercle of the tibia. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus medius, psoas and iliacus, sartorius ; and for the lower three-fourths of its extent, with the fascia lata. By its deep smface with the capsule of the hip- joint, the external circumflex vessels, crureus, and vastus internus and extemus. The rectus must now be divided through its middle, and the two ends turned aside, to bring clearly into view the next muscles. The three next muscles are generally considered collectively under the name of triceps extensor cruris. Adopting this view, the muscle 5 surrounds the whole of the femur, excepting the rough line, (linea - aspera) on its posterior aspect. Its division into three parts is not well defined ; the fleshy mass upon each side being distinguished by the names of vastus internus and extemus, the middle portion by that of cmreus. The Vastus externus, narrow below and broad above, arises from the outer border of the patella, and is inserted into the femur and outer side of the linea aspera, as high as the base of the trochanter major. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia lata, rectus, : biceps, semi-membranosus and gluteus maximus, a synovial bursa being interposed between it and the latter. By its deep surface with the crureus and femur. The Vastus internus, broad below and narrow above, arises ; from the inner border of the patella, and is inserted into the femur a and inner side of the linea aspera as high up as the anterior intertro- chanteric line.

By its j i deep surface with the cmreus and femur. I The Crureus (eras, the leg) arises from the upper border of the patella, and is inserted into the front aspect of the femur, as high as the anterior intertrochanteric line. When the crureus is divided from i its insertion, a small muscular fasciculus is often seen upon the lower 1 part of the femur, which is inserted into the pouch of synovial mem- K brane, that extends upwards from the knee-joint, behind the patella. sINTERNAL FEMORAL REGION. •258 This fasciculus is named, from its situation, suh-crureus, and would seem to be intended to support the synovial membrane. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external circumflex vessels, the rectus, vastus intemus and extemus. By its deep surface with the femur, the sub-cmreus, and synovial membrane of the knee- joint. Actions,—The tensor vaginae femoris renders the fascia lata tense, and slightly inverts the limb. The sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, and, continuing to act, the thigh upon the pelvis, at the same time carrying the leg across that of the opposite side, into the position in which tailors sit; hence its name. Taking its fixed point from below, it assists the extensor muscles in steadying the leg, for the support of the trunk. The other four muscles have been collectively named quadriceps extensor, from their similarity of action. They extend the leg upon the thigh, and obtain a great increase of power by their attachment to the patella, which acts as a fulcrum. Taking their fixed point from the tibia, they steady the femur upon the leg, and the rectus, by being attached to the pelvis, serves to balance the trunk upon the lower extremity. Internal Femoral Region. Iliacus internus. Psoas magnus, Pectineus, Adductor longus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus, Gracilis. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by the removal of the inner flap of integument recommended in the dissection of the anterior femoral region. The iliacus and psoas arising from within the abdo- men can only be seen in their entire extent after the removal of the viscera from that cavity. The Iliacus internus is a flat radiated muscle. It anses from the whole extent of the inner concave surface of the ilium ; and, after joining with the tendon of the psoas, is inserted into the trochanter minor of the femur. A few fibres of this muscle are derived from the base of the sacrum, and others from the capsular ligament of the hip- joint. Relations.—By its anterior surface, within the pelvis, with the ex- ternal cutaneous nerve, and with the iliac fascia, which separates the muscle from the peritoneum, on the right from the coecum, and on the left from the sigmoid flexure of the colon; externally to the pelvis, ndth the fascia lata, rectus, and sartorius. Bj' its posterior surface with the iliac fossa, margin of the pehns, and with the capsule of the hip-joint, a synovial bursa of large size being interposed. This bursa is some- times continuous with the s}’novial membrane of the ilio-femoral arti-PSOAS. PECTINEUS. 259 culation. By its inner bonier tlie iliacus is in relation with the psoas magnus and crural nerve. The Psoas .mag.vus (ypacc, lumhus, a loin), situated by the side of the vertebral column in the loins, is a long fusifonn muscle. It arises from the intervertebral substances, part of the bodies and bases of the transverse processes, and from a series of tendinous arches, thrown across the constricted portion of the last dorsal and four upper lumbar vertebrm. These arches are intended to protect the lumbar arteries and sympathetic filaments of nerves from pressure in their passage beneath the muscle. From this extensive origin the muscle passes along tlie margin of the brim of the pelvis, and beneath Poupart’s ligament, to its insertion. The tendon of the psoas magnus unites with that of the iliacus, and the conjoined tendon is inserted into the posterior part of the trochanter minor, a bursa being interposed. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, the kidney, the psoas parvus, genito-crural nerve, sjunpathetic nerve, its proper fascia, the peritoneum and colon, and along its pelvic border with the common and external iliac arterj' and vein. Bj' its posterior surface with the lumbar vertebrae, the lumbar arteries, quadratus lumborum (from which latter it is separated by the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis), and with the crural nerve, which near Poupart’s ligament gets to its outer side. The lumbar plexus of nerves is situated in the substance of the posterior part of the muscle. In the thigh the muscle is in relation with the fascia lata in front; the border of the pelvis and hip-joint, from which it «is separated by the synovial membrane, common to it and the preceding muscle, behind; with the crural nerve, and iliacus : to the outer side; and with the femoral artery, by which it is slightly overlaid, to the inner side. The Pectixeus is a flat and quadrangular muscle ; it arises from ; the pectineal line (pecten, a crest) of the os pubis, and from the sur- face of bone in front of that line. It is imerted into the line leading from the anterior intertrochanteric line to the linea aspera of the : femur.

The adductor brevis is pierced near its insertion by the middle perfoi-ating artery. The adductor brevis may now be divided from its origin and turned outwards, or its inner two-thirds may be cut away entirely, when the adductor magnus muscle will be exposed in its entire extent. The Adductor siagnus is a broad tiiangular muscle, forming a septum of division between the muscles situated on the anterior and those on the posterior aspect of the thigh. It arises by fleshy fibres from the ramus of the pubes and ischium and froyi the side of the tuber ischii; and radiating in its passage outwards, is inserted into the whole length of the linea aspera, and inner condyle of the femur. The adductor magnus is pierced by five openings : the three superior, for the three perforating lU’teries ; and the fourth, for the tenuination of the profunda. The fifth is the hu-ge oval opening, in the tendinous portion of the muscle, that gives passage to the femoral vessels.

The gracilis }; is likewise an adductor of the thigh ; but contributes also to the flexion I of the leg, by its attachment to the inner tuberosity of the tibia. I Posterior Femoral Region. I Biceps, I Semi-tendinosus, Semi-membranosus. Dissection.—Remove the integument and fascia on the posterior i part of the thigh by two flaps, as on the anterior region, and turn aside the gluteus maximus from the upper part; the muscles may then be examined. The Biceps femoris (bis, double, xi(paXh, head) arises by two heads, one by a common tendon with the semi-tendinosus ; the other muscular and much shorter, from the lower two-thirds of the external border of the linea aspera. This muscle forms the outer hamstring, and is inserted by a strong tendon into the head of the fibula; a portion of the tendon is continued downwards into the fascia of the leg, and another is attached to the outer tuberosity of the tibia.

The Semi-membranosus, re- markable for the tendinous expan- sion upon its anterior and posterior surface, arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the com- mon origin of the two preceding muscles. It is inserted into the posterior part of the inner tubero- sity of the tibia; at its insertion the tendon splits into three portions, one of which is inserted in a groove on the inner side of the head of the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The second is continuous with an aponeurotic expansion that binds down the popliteus muscle, the popliteal fascia; and the third turns upwards and outwards to the external condyle of the femur, forming the middle portion of the posterior ligament of the knee- joint (ligamentum posticum Wins- lowii). The tendons of the last two muscles, viz. the semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus, with those of the gracilis and sartorius, form the inner hamstring.

If the semi-niembranosus muscle be turned down from its origin, the student will bring into view the broad and radiated expanse of the adductor magnus, upon which the three flexor muscles above described rest. Actions.—These three hamstring muscles are the direct flexors of the leg upon the thigh ; and, by taking their origin from below, they balance the pelvis on the lower extremities. The biceps, from the obliquity of its direction, everts the leg when partly flexed, and the semi-tendinosus turns the leg inwards when in the same state of flexion. Anterior Tibial Region. Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitonmi, Peroneus ter tins, Extensor proprius pollicis. Dissection.—The dissection of the anterior tibial region is to be commenced by carrying an incision along the middle of the leg, mid- way between the tibia and the fibula, from tlie knee to the ankle, and bounding it inferiorly by a transverse incision extending from one malleolus to the other. And to expose the tendons on the dorsum of the foot, the longitudinal incision may be carried onwards to the outer side of the base of the great toe, and be terminated by another incision directed across the heads of the metatarsal bones. The Tibialis anticus muscle (flexor tarsi tibialis) arises from the upper two-thirds of the tibia, from the interosseous membrane, and from the deep fascia; its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular ligament, and is inserted into the inner side of the in- ternal cuneiform bone, and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia, from which many of its superior fibres arise, and with the anterior annular liga- ment.

The Extensor longus digitorum arises from the head of the tibia, from the upper three-fourths of the fibula, from the interosseous membrane, and from the deep fascia. Below, it divides into four ten- dons, which pass beneath the annular ligament, to be inseiied into the second and third phalanges of the four lesser toes.

Fig, 108.* icniarkable, each tendon spreads into a broad aponeurosis over the first phalanx; this aponeurosis divides into three slips, the middle one is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral slips are continued onwards, to be inserted into the base of the third. Relations.—By its anterior surface., with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and with the anterior annular liga- ment. By its posterior surface with the interosseous membrane, fibula, ankle-joint, extensor brevis digitorum which separates its tendons from the tarsus, and with the metatarsus and phalanges. By its inner surface with the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels. By its outer border with the peroneus lon- gus and brevis. The Peroneus tertius (flexor tarsi fibularis) arises from the lower fourth of the fibula, and is inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Although apparently but a mere division or continuation of the extensor longus digitorum, this muscle ma)"^ be looked upon as analo- gous to the flexor carpi ulnaris of the fore-arm. Sometimes it is altogether wanting. The Extensor proprius pollicis lies between the tibialis anticus and ex- tensor longus digitorum. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula and interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular ligament, and is inserted mio the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. * The muscles of the anterior tibial region. 1.

By its posterior stirface ^^0-109.* with the interosseous membrane, the fibula, the tibia, the ankle-joint, the peroneus tertius are direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg; acting in conjunc- tion with the tibialis posticus they direct the foot inwards, and with the peroneus longus and brevis outwards. They assist also in preserving the flat- ness of the foot during progression. The extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis, are direct extensors of the phalanges; but, con- tinuing their action, they assist the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, in flexing the entire foot upon the leg. Taking their origin from below, they increase the stability of the ankle-joint.

Turn aside the flaps of integument and remove the fascim from the whole of this region ; the gastrocnemius muscle will then be exposed. The Gastrocnemius (^ya.ar^ox.rof/AO't^ the bellied part of the leg) arises by two heads from the two condyles of the femur, the inner head being the longest. They unite to form the beautiful muscle so characteristic of this region of the limb. It is inserted, by means of the tendo Achillis, into the lower part of the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis, a synovial bursa being placed between that tendon and the upper part of the tuberosity. The gastrocnemius must be removed from its origin, and turned down, in order to expose the next muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the leg, which separates it from the external saphenous vein, and with the ex- ternal saphenous nerve. By its fleep surface with the lateral portions of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, the popliteus, plantaris,and soleus. The internal head of the muscle rests against the posterior surface of the internal condyle of the femur; the external head against the outer side of the external condyle. In the latter a sesamoid bone is sometimes found. The Plantaris (planta, the sole of the foot), an extremelj’’ diminu- tive muscle situated between the gastrocnemius and soleus, arises from the outer condyle of the femur; and is inserted, by its long and deli- cately slender tendon, into the inner side of the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis, by the side of the tendo Achillis ; having crossed ob- liquely between the two muscles. The Soleus (solea, a sole,) is the broad muscle upon which the plantaris rests. It arises from the head and upper third of the fibula, from the oblique line and middle third of the tibia. Its fibres con- verge to the tendo Achillis, by which it is inserted into the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. Between the fibular and tibial origins of this muscle is a tendinous arch, beneath which the popliteal vessels and nerve pass into the leg. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gastrocnemius and plantaris. By its deep surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis, from the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and from the peroneal vessels. Actions.—The three muscles of the calf draw powerfully on the os calcis, and lift the heel; continuing their action, they raise the entire body. This action is attained by means of a lever of the second power, the fulcrum (the toes) being at one end, the weight (the body supported on the tibia) in the middle, and the power (these muscles) at the other extremity. They are, therefore, the walking muscles, and perform all move- ments that require the support of the whole body from the ground, asFLEXOR LONGUS I’OLLICIS. 2C7 dancing, leaping, &c. Taking their fixed point from below, they steady the leg upon the foot. Deep layer. * Popliteus, Flexor longus pollicis. Flexor longus digitorum. Tibialis posticus. Dissection.—After the removal of the soleus, the deep layer will be found bound down by an intermuscular fascia which is to be dissected away ; the muscles may then be examined. The Popliteus muscle (poples, the ham of the leg), forms the floor of the popliteal region at its lower part, and is bound tightly down by a strong fascia derived from the middle slip of the tendon of the semi- membranosus muscle. It arises by a rounded tendon from a deep groove on the outer side of the external condyle of the femim, beneath the external lateral ligament; and spreading obliquely over the head of the tibia, is inserted into the surface of bone above its oblique line. This line is called, from being the limit of insertion of the popliteus muscle, the popliteal line. Relations.—By its superficial suifiace with a thick fascia which separates it from the two heads of the gastrocnemius, the plantaris, and the popliteal vessels and nerve. By its deep surfaee with the sy- novial membrane of the knee-joint and with the upper part of the tibia. The Flexor longus pollicis is the most superficial of the next three muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula, and passes through a groove in the astragalus and os calcis, which is con- verted by tendinous fibres into a distinct sheath lined by a synovial membrane, into the sole of the foot ; it is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the intemiuscular fascia, which separates it from the soleus and tendo Achillis. By its deep sur- face with the tibialis posticus, fibula, fibular vessels, interosseous mem- brane, and ankle-joint. By its outer border with the peroneus longus and brevis. By its inner border with the flexor longus digitorum. In the foot, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis is connected with that of the flexor longus digitorum by a short tendinous slip. The Flexor longus digitoruai (perforans) arises from the sur- face of the tibia, immediately below the popliteal line. Its tendon passes through a sheath, common to it and the tibialis posticus, behind the inner malleolus ; it then passes through a second sheath which is connected with a groove in the astragalus and os calcis, into the sole of the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes, perforating the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the intermuscular fascia, (which separates it from the soleus,) and with the posterior tibial vessels2G8 POSTERIOH TIlilAL REGION.—DEEP PAVER. and nerve. By its deep surface with the tibia and tibialis posticus. In the sole of the foot its tendon is in Fig. 110.* relation with the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum, which lie super- ficially to it, and it crosses the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. At the point of crossing it receives the ten- dinous slip of communication from the latter. The flexor longus pollicis must now be removed from its origin, and the flexor longus digitorum drawn aside, to bring into view the entire extent of the tibialis posticus. The Tibialis posticus (extensor tarsi tibialis) lies upon the interosseous membrane, between the two bones of the leg. It arises by two heads from the adjacent sides of the tibia and fibula their whole length, and from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and runs in the same sheath; it then passes through a proper sheath over the del- toid ligament, and beneath the calcaneo- scaphoid articulation, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid and in- ternal cuneiform bone. While in the common sheath behind the internal malleolus, the tendon of the tibialis posticus lies intemallj' to that of the flexor longus digitorum, from which it is separated by a thin fibrous partition. A sesamoid bone is usually met with in the tendon close to its insertion.

The student will observe that the two latter muscles change their relative position to each other in their course. Thus, in the leg, the position of the three muscles from within outwards, is, flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis. At the inner mal- leolus, the relation of the tendons is, tibialis posticus, flexor longus di- gitorum, both in the same sheath; then a broad groove, which lodges ' the posterior tibial artery, venae comites, and nerve; and lastly, the flexor longus pollicis. Actions.—The popliteus is a flexor of the tibia upon the thigh, carrying it at the same time inwards so as to invert the leg. The flexor longus pollicis, and flexor longus digitorum are the long flexors of the toes ; their tendons are connected in the foot by a short tendi- nous band, hence they necessarily act together. The tibialis posticus is an extensor of the tarsus upon the leg, and an antagonist to the ! tibialis anticus. It combines with the tibialis anticus in adduction of the foot.

Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by continuing the dissection I of the anterior tibial region outwards beyond the fibula, to the border ! of the posterior tibial region. ) The Peroneus longus fibula, extensor tarsi fibidaris lon- I gior) muscle arises from the head and upper third of the outer side of i the fibula, and terminates in a long tendon, which passes behind the ' external malleolus, and obliquely across the sole of the foot, through I the groove in the cuboid bone, to be inserted into the base of the me- tatarsal bone of the great toe. Its tendon is thickened where it glides behind the external malleolus, and a sesamoid bone is developed in that part which plays upon the cuboid bone. Relations.—By its superfcial surface with the fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, peroneus brevis, os calcis, and cuboid bone, and near the head of the fibula with the fibular nerve. By its anterdor border it is separated from the extensor longus digitorum by the attachment of the fascia of the leg to the fibula; and by the posterior border by the same medium from the soleus and flexor longus pollicis. The tendon of the peroneus longus is furnished with three fibrous sheaths and as many synovial membranes; the first is situated behind the external malleolus, and is common to this muscle and the peroneus brevis, the second on the outer side of the os calcis, and the third on the cuboid bone. The Peroneus brevis (extensor tarsi fibularis brevier) lies be-MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. 270 neatli the peroneus longus ; it arises from the lower half of the fibula, and terminates in a tendon which passes behind the external nuilleolus and through a groove in the os calcis, to be inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Relations.—By its superjicial surface with the peroneus longus and fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, the os calcis, and cuboid bone. The lateral rehations of the muscle are the same as those of the peroneus longus. The tendon of the peroneus brevis has but two tendinous sheaths and two synovial membranes, one behind the external malleolus and common to both peronei, the other upon the side of the os calcis. Actions.—The peronei muscles are' extensors of the foot, conjointly with the tibialis posticus. They antagonise the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, which are flexors of the foot. The whole of these muscles acting together, tend to maintain the flatness of the foot, so necessary to security in walking. Foot. Dorsal Region. Extensor brevis digitorum, Interossei dorsales. The Extensor brevis digitorum muscle arises from the outer side of the os calcis, crosses the foot obliquelj’", and terminates in four tendons, the innermost of which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three into the sides of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. Relations.—By its upper surface with the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, peroneus brevis, and with the deep fascia of the foot. By its under surface with the tarsal and metatarsal bones. Its inner border is in relation with the dorsalis pedis artery, and the innermost tendon of the muscle crosses that artery just before its division. The Dorsal interossei muscles are placed between the metatarsal bones; they resemble the anrdogous muscles in the hand in arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal- bones; their tendons are inserted into the base of the first phalanx, and into the digital expansion of the tendons of the long extensor. The first dorsal mterosseous is inserted into the inner side of the second toe, and is therefore an adductor: the other three are inserted into the outer side of the second, third, and fourth toes^ and are conse- quently abductors. Relations.—By their upper surface with a strong fascia which sepa- rates them from the extensor tendons. By their under surface with the plantar interossei. Each of the muscles gives passage to a small artery (posterior perforating) which communicates with the external planter artery. And between the heads of the first interosseous muscle the communicating arter}' of the dorsalis jied'is takes its course.ABDL-CTOR POLLICIS. 271 Plantar Region. First Layer. Abductor pollicis, Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis digitorum. Dissection.—The sole of the foot is best dissected by carrying an incision around the heel, and along the inner and outer borders of the foot, to the great and little toes. This incision should divide the integument p^g and superficial fascia, and both together should be dissected from the deep fascia, as far forward as the base of the pha- langes, where they may be removed from the foot altogether. The deep rascia should then be removed, and the first layer of muscles will be brought into view. The Abductor pollicis lies along the inner border of the foot; it arises by two heads, between which the tendons of the long flexors, arteries, veins, and nerves enter the sole of the foot. One head arises from the inner tuberosity of the 03 calcis, the other from the internal annular ligament and plantar fascia.

The Flexor brevis pollicis arises by a pointed tendinous pro- cess from the side of the cuboid, and from the external cuneiform bone; it is inserted by two heads into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Two sesamoid bones are developed in the tendons of inser- tion of these two heads, and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis lies in the groove between them.

The latter has for its office the drawing to- gether of the toes.276 CHAPTER IV. ON THE FASCIA. Fascia (fascia, a bandage) is the name assigned to laminae of various extent and thickness, which are distributed through the dif- ferent regions of the body, for the purpose of investing or protecting the softer and more delicate organs. From a consideration of their structure, these fasciae may be arranged into two groups: areolo-fibrous fasciae, and aponeurotic fasciae. The areolo-fibrous fascia is best illustrated in the common subcuta- neous investment of the entire body, the superficial fascia. This structure is situated immediately beneath the integument over every part of the frame, and is the medium of connection between that layer and the deeper parts. It is composed of areolo-fibrous tissue contain- ing in its areolae an abundance of adipose cells. The fat being a bad conductor of caloric, serves to retain the warmth of the body ; while it forms at the same time a yielding tissue, through which the minute vessels and nerves pass to the papillary layer of the skin, without incurring the risk of obstruction from injury or pressure upon the sur- face. By dissection, the superficial fascia may be separated into two layers, between which are found the superficial or cutaneous vessels and nerves ; as the superficial epigastric artery, the saphenous veins, the radial and ulnar veins, the superficial lymphatic vessels, also the cutaneous muscles, as the platysma myoides, orbicularis palpebrarum, sphincter ani, &c. In other situations, the areolo-fibrous fascia is found condensed into a strong and inelastic membrane, as is exemplified in the deep fascia of the neck, the thoracic, transversalis, and perineal fasciae, and the sheaths of vessels. The aponeurotic fascia is the strongest kind of investing membrane; it is composed of tendinous fibres, running parallel with each other, and connected by other fibres of the same kind passing in different directions. When freshly exposed, it is brilliant and nacreous, and is tough, inelastic, and unyielding. In the limbs it forms the deep fascia, enclosing and forming distinct sheaths to all the muscles and tendons. It is thick upon the outer and least protected side of the limb, and thinner upon its inner side. It is firmly connected to the bones, and to the prominent points of each region, as to the pelvis, knee, and ankle, in the lower, and to the clavicle, scapula, elbow, and wrist, in the upper extremity. It assists the muscles in their action, by keep- ing up a tonic pressure on their surface; aids materially in the circula-It t FASCL12 OF THE HEAD AND NECK. tion of the fluids in opposition to the laws of gravity; and in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is a powerful protection to the struc- tures which enter into the composition of these regions. In some situations its tension is regulated by muscular action, as by the tensor vaginm femoris and gluteus maximus in the thigh, by the biceps in the leg, and by the biceps and palmaris longus in the arm; in other situa- tions it affords an extensive surface for the origin of the fibres of muscles. The fasciae may be arranged like the other textures of the body into 1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. FASCIA OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The Te.hporal fascla is a strong aponeurotic membrane which covers in the temporal muscle at each side of the head, and gives origin by its internal surface to some of its muscular fibres. It is attached to the whole extent of the temporal ridge above, and to the zygomatic arch below ; in the latter situation it is thick and divided into two layers, the external being connected to the upper border of the arch, and the internal to its inner surface. A small quantity of fat is usually found between these two layers, together with the orbital branch of the temporal artery. Cervical fascia.—The fasciae of the neck are the superficial and the deep. The superficial cervical fascia is a part of the common superficial fascia of the entire body, and is only interesting from con- taining between its layers the platysma myoides muscle. The deep cervical fascia is a strong areolo-fibrous layer which in- vests the muscles of the neck, and retains and supports the vessels and nerves. It commences posteriorly at the ligamentum nuchae, and passes forwards at each side beneath the trapezius muscle to the posterior border of the stemo-mastoid ; here it divides into two layers, which embrace that muscle and unite upon its anterior border to be prolonged onwards to the middle line of the neck, where it becomes continuous with the fascia of the opposite side. Besides thus constituting a sheath for the stemo-mastoid, it also forms sheaths for the other muscles of the neck over which it passes. If the superficial layer of the sheath of the stemo-mastoid be traced upwards, it will be found to pass over the parotid gland and masseter muscle, and to be inserted into the zygo- matic arch ; and if it be traced downwards, it will be seen to pass in front of the clavicle, and become lost upon the pectoralis major muscle. If the deep layer of the sheath be examined superiorly, it will be found attached to the styloid process, from which it is reflected to the angle of the lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament; and if it be followed downwards, it will be found connected with the tendon278 DEEP CERVICAL FASCIA. of the omo-hyoid muscle, and may thence he traced behind the ckvicle, where it encloses the subclavius muscle, and, being extended from the cartilage of the first rib to the coracoid process, constitutes the costo- coracoid membrane. In front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the deep Fig. 113 * fascia is attached to the border of the lower jaw and os hyoides, and forms a distinct sheath for the submaxillary gland. Inferiorly it divides into two layers, one of which passes in front of the sternum, while the other is attached to its superior border. * A transverse section of the neck, shewing the deep cervical fascia and its numerous prolongations, forming sheaths for the different muscles.

The thoracic /iucia"* is a dense layer of areolo-fibrous membrane stretched horizontally across the superior opening of the thorax. It is firmly attached to the concave margin of the first rib, and to the inner surface of the sternum. In front it leaves an opening for the connection of the cervical with the thoracic portion of the thymus gland, and behind it forms an arch across the vertebral column, to give passage to the oesophagus. At the point where the great vessels and trachea pass through the thoracic fascia, it divides into an ascending and descending layer. The ascendinff layer is attached to the trachea, and becomes continuous with the sheath of the carotid vessels, and with the deep cervical fascia ; the descending layer descends upon the trachea to its bifurca- tion, surrounds the large vessels arising from the arch of the aorta, and the upper part of the arch itself, and is continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. It is connected also with the venae innomi- natae and superior cava, and is attached to the areolo-fibrous capsule of the thymus gland. “ The thoracic fascia,” writes Sir Astley Cooper, “ performs three important offices:— “ 1st. It forms the upper boundary of the chest, as the diaphragm does the lower. “ 2nd. It steadily preserves the relative situation of the parts which enter and quit the thoracic opening. “ 3rd. It attaches and supports the heart in its situation, through the medium of its connection with the aorta and large vessels which are placed at its curvature.” ABDOMINAL FASCIiE. The lower part of the parietes of the abdomen, and the cavity of the pelvis, are strengthened by a layer of fascia which lines their internal surface, and at the bottom of the latter cavity is reflected inwards to the sides of the bladder. This fascia is continuous throughout the whole of the above-mentioned surface; but for convenience of descrip- tion is considered under the several names of transversalis fascia, iliac fascia, and pelvic fascia; the two former meet at the crest of the ilium and Poupart’s ligament, and the latter is confined to the cavity of the true pelvis. The fascia transversalis (Fascia Cooperi)t is an areolo-fibrous lamella which lines the inner surface of the transversalis muscle. It is thick and dense below, near the lower part of the abdomen ; but becomes thinner as it ascends, and is gradually lost in the subserous areolar • For an excellent description of this fascia, see Sir Astley Cooper’s work on the “ Anatomy of the Thymus Gland.” t Sir Astley Cooper first described this fascia in its important relation to inguinal hernia.•280 INGUINAL HERNIA. tissue. It is attached inferiorly to the reflected margin of Poupart’s ligament and to the crest of the ilium ; internally to the border of the rectus muscle; and,at the inner third of thefemond arch, is continued beneath Poupart’s ligament, and forms the anterior segment of the crural canal, or sheath of the femoral vessels. The internal abdominal ring is situated in this fascia, at about mid- way between the spine of the os pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and half an inch above Poupart’s ligament; it is bounded upon its inner side by a well-marked falciform border, but is ill-defined around its outer margin. From the circumference of this ring is given off an infundibiliform process, which surrounds the testicle and sper- matic cord, constituting the fascia propria of the latter, and forms the first investment to the sac of oblique inguinal hernia. It is the strength of this fascia, in the interval between the tendon of the rectus and the internal abdominal ring, that defends this portion of the pari- etes from the frequent occurrence of direct inguinal hernia. INGUINAL HERNIA. Inguinal hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. In Oblique inguinal hernia the intestine escapes from the cavity of the abdomen into the spermatic canal, through the internal abdo- minal ring, pressing before it a pouch of peritoneum which constitutes the hernial sac, and distending the infundibiliform process of the trans- versalis fascia. After emerging through the internal abdominal ring, it passesbeneath the lower and arched border of the transversalis muscle ; then beneath the lower border of the internal oblique muscle ; and finally through the external abdominal ring in the aponeurosis of the external oblique. From the transversalis muscle it receives no in- vestment ; while passing beneath the lower border of the internal oblique it obtains the cremaster muscle ; and, upon escaping at the external abdominal ring, receives the intercolumnar fascia. So that the coverings of an oblique inguinal hernia, after it has emerged through the external abdominal ring, are, from the surface to the intestine, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia. Cremaster muscle, Transversalis, or infundibiliform fascia, Peritoneal sac. The spermatic canal, which, in the normal condition of the abdomi- nal parietes serves for the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament with its vessels in the female, is about one inch and a half in length. It is bounded in front bj^ the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle; behind b}'^ the transversalis fascia, and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis muscle; above by the ai’ched borders of the internal oblique and transversalis ;DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA. ■281 bdoiv by the grooved border of Poupart’s ligament; and at each ex- tremity by one of the abdominal rings, the internal ring at the inner termination, the external ring at the outer extremity. These relations may be more distinctly illustrated by the following plan— Above. Lower borders of internal oblique and transvorsalis muscle. In Front, Behind. Transversalis fascia. Conjoined tendon of internal oblique and transversalis. Below. Grooved border of Poupart’s ligament. There are three * varieties of oblique inguinal hernia :—common ongenital, and encysted. Common oblique lienmia is that which has been described above. Congenital hernia results from the nonclosure of the pouch of peri- toneum carried do\vnwards into the scrotum by the testicle, during its • descent in the foetus. The intestine at some period of life is forced into this canal, and de- scends through it into the tunica vaginalis where it lies in contact with the testicle ; so that congenital hernia has no proper sac, but is con- tained within the tunica vaginalis. The other coverings are the same as those of common inguinal hernia. Encysted hernia (hernia infantilis, of Hey) is that form of protrusion in which the pouch of peritoneum forming the tunica vaginalis, being only partially closed, and remaining open externally to the abdomen, admits of the hernia passing into the scrotum, behind the tunica vagi- nalis. So that the surgeon, in operating upon this variety, requires to divide three layers of serous membrane; the first and second layers being those of the tunica vaginalis; and the third the true sac of the hernia. Direct inguinal hernia has received its name from passing di- rectly through the external abdominal ring, and forcing before it the opposing parietes. This portion of the wall of the abdomen is strength- ened by the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis muscle, which is pressed before the hernia, and forms one of its in- vestments. Its coverings are, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia. Conjoined tendon, Transversalis fascia. Peritoneal sac. * Velpeau describes a fourth in which the protrusion takes place between the edge of the rectus and the umbilical ligament, and then takes the course of the spermatic canal. Aponeurosis of external oblique.282 ILIAC FASCIA.—PELVIC FASCIA, Direct inguinal hernia differs from oblique in never attaining tlie same bulk, in consequence of the resisting nature of the conjoined tendon of the internal oldique and transversalis and of the transversalis fascia; in its direction, having a tendency to protrude from the middle line rather than towards it. Thirdly, in making for itself a new pas- sage through the abdominal parietes, instead of following a natural channel; and fourthly, in the relation of the neck of its sac to the epigastric artery; that vessel lying to the outer side of the opening of the sac of direct hernia, and to the inner side of that of oblique hernia. All the forms of inguinal hernia are designated scrotal, when they have descended into that cavity. The Fascia iliaca is the aponeurotic investment of the psoas and iliacus muscles; and, like the fascia transversalis, is thick below, and becomes gradually thinner as it ascends. It is attached superiorly along the edge of the psoas, to the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, to the ligamentum arcuatum internum, and to the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, leaving arches corresponding with the constricted portions of the -vertebrae for the passage of the lumbar vessels. Lower down it passes beneath the external iliac vessels, and is attached along the margin of the true pelvis; externally, it is con- nected to the crest of the ilium; and, inferiorly, to the outer two-thirds of Poupart’s ligament, where it is continuous with the fascia trans- versalis. Passing beneath Poupart’s ligament, it surrounds the psoas and iliacus muscles to their termination, and beneath the inner third of the femoral arch forms the posterior segment of the sheath of the femoral vessels. The Fascia pelvicaIs attached to the inner surface of the os pubis and along the margin of the brim of the pelvis, where it is continuous with the iliac fascia. From this extensive origin it descends into the pelvis, and divides into two layers, the pelvic and obturator. The pelvic layer or fascia, when traced from the internal surface of the os pubis near the symphysis, is seen to be reflected inwards to the neck of the bladder, so as to form the anterior vesical ligaments. Traced backwai'ds, it passes between the sacral plexus of nerves, and the internal iliac vessels, and is attached to the anterior surface of the sacrum ; and, followed from the sides of the pelvis, it descends to the base of the bladder and divides into three layers, one ascending, is re- flected upon the side of that viscus, encloses the vesical plexus of veins, and forms the lateral ligaments of the bladder. A middle layer passes inwards between the base of the bladder and the upper surface of the rectum, and is named by Mr. Tyrrell the recto-vesical fascia; and an inferior layer passes behind the rectum, and, with the layer of the op- posite side, completely invests that intestine. The obturator fascia passes directly do^rawards from the splitting of the layers of the pelvic fascia, and covers in the obturator intemus muscle and the internal pudic vessels and nerve ; it is attached to the ramus of the os pubis and ischium in front, and below to the felcifonn283 PERINEAL FASCL'E. margin of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament. Lying between these two layers of fascia is the levator ani muscle, which arises from their angle of separation. The levator ani is covered in inferiorly by a Fig. 114 * third layer of fascia, which is given off by the obturator fascia, and is continued downwards upon the inferior surface of the muscle to the ! extremity of the rectum, where it is lost. This layer may be named i from its position and inferior attachment the anal fascia. Perineal fasci^e.—In the perineum there are two fasciae of much importance, the superficial and deep perineal fascia. I The superficial perineal fascia is a thin aponeurotic la}’'er, which covers in the muscles of the genital portion of the perineum and the I root of the penis. It is firmly attached at each side to the ramus of the os pubis and ischium ; posteriorly it is reflected backwards beneath the transversi perinei muscles to become connected with the deep 1 perineal fascia; while anteriorly it is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum. • A transvers'e section of the pelvis, shewing the distribution of the pelvic fascia. 1.

Tlie deep pcriveal fascia (Camper’s ligament, triangular ligament) is situated liehind the root of the penis, and is firmly stretched across between the ramus of the os pubis and ischium of each side, so as to con- stitute a strong septum of defence to the outlet of the pelvis. At its inferior border it divides into two layers, one of which is continued forwards, and is continuous with the superficial perineal fascia; while the other is prolonged backwards to the rectum, and, joining with the anal fascia, assists in supporting the extremity of that intestine. The deep perineal fascia is composed of two layers, which are separated from each other by several important parts, and traversed by the mem- branous portion of the urethra. The anterior layer is nearly plane in its direction, and sends a sheath forwards around the anterior termina- tion of the membranous urethra to be attached to the posterior part of Fiy. 115.* the bulb.

Mr. Tyrrell considers the anterior lamella alone as the deep perineal fascia, and the posterior lamella as a distinct layer of fascia covering in a considerable plexus of veins. FASCliE OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia of the upper extremity contains between its layers the superficial veins and lymphatics, and the superficial nerves. The deep fascia is thin over the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, and in the axillary space, but thick upon the dorsiun of the scapula, where it binds down the infra-spinatus muscle. It is attach- ed to the clavicle, acromion process, and spine of the scapida. In the upper arm it is somewhat stronger, and is inserted into the condyloid ridges, forming the intennuscular septa. In the fore-arm it is very strong, and at the bend of the elbow its thickness is augmented by a broad band, which is given off from the inner side of the tendon of the biceps. It is firmly attached to the olecranon process, to the ulna, and to the prominent points about the wrist. Upon the front of the wrist it is continuous with the anterior annular ligament, which is considered by some anatomists to be formed by the deep fascia, but which I am more disposed to regard as a ligament of the wrist. On the posterior aspect of this joint it forms a strong transverse band, the posterior annular ligament, beneath which the tendons of the extensor muscles pass, in distinct sheaths. The attachments of the posterior annular ligament are, the radius on one side, and the ulna and pisi- form bone on the opposite side of the joint. The tendons, as they pass beneath the annular ligaments, are sur- rounded by synovial bursae. The dorsum of the hand is invested by a thin fascia, which is continuous with the posterior annular bga- ment. The palmar fascia is divided into three portions. A central portion, which occupies the middle of the palm, and two lateral portions, w'hich spread out over the sides of the hand, and are continuous -with the dorsal fascia. The central portion is strong and tendinous : it is narrow at the wrist, where it is attached to the annular ligament, and broad over the heads of the metacarpal bones, where it divides into eight slips, which are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of each finger. The fascia is strengthened at its point of division into slips by strong fasciculi of transverse fibres, and the arched interval left between each pair of slips gives passage to the tendons of the flexor muscles. The arches between the fingers trans- mit the digital vessels and nerves, and lumbricales muscles.FASCI.E OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia contains between its two layers the super- ficial vessels and nerves of the lower extremity. At the groin these two layers are separated from each other by tlie superficial lymphatic glands^ and the deep layer is attached to Poupart’s ligament, while the superficial layer is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen. The deep fascia of the thigh is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata ; it is thick and strong upon the outer side of the limb, and thinner upon its inner and posterior side. That portion of fascia which invests the gluteus maximus is very thin, but that which covers in the gluteus medius is excessively thick, and gives origin, by its inner surface, to the superficial fibres of that muscle. The fascia lata is attached superiorly to Poupart’s ligament, the crest of the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, tuberosity of the ischium, ramus of the ischium and pubes,and body of the pubes; in the thigh it is inserted into the linea aspera, and aroimd the knee is connected with the prominent points of • that joint. It possesses also two muscular attachments, by means of the tensor vaginae femoris, which is inserted between its two layers on the outer side, and the gluteus maximus, which is attached to it behind. In addition to the smaller openings in the fascia lata which transmit the small cutaneous vessels and nerves, there exists at the upper and inner extremity of the thigh an oblique foramen, which gives passage to the superficial lymphatic vessels, and the large subcutaneous vein of the lower extremity, the internal saphenous vein, and is thence named the sapltenotcs opening. The existence of this opening has given rise to the division of the upper part of the fascia lata into two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is situated upon the iliac side of the opening. It is attached to the crest of the ihum, and along Poupart’s ligament to the spine of the os pubis, whence it is reflected downwards and out- wards in an arched direction, and forms a falciform border, which con- stitutes the outer boundaiy of the saphenous opening. The edge of this border immediately overlies, and is reflected upon, the sheath of : the femoral vessels, and the lower extremity of the curve is continuous with the pubic portion. The pubic portion, occupying the pubic side of the saphenous ' opening, is attached to the spine of the os pubis and pectineal line ; ..and, passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, ' divides into two layers ; the anterior layer is continuous with that ) portion of the iliac fascia which forms the sheath of the iliacus and ; psoas muscles, and the posterior layer is lost upon the capsule of the 1 hip-joint. The interval between the falciform border of the iliac portion and ; the opposite surface of the pubic portion is closed by a fibrous layer, •' which is pierced by numerous openings for the passage of lymphaticI FASCIA LATA.— FEMORAL KING. ^ vessels, and is thence ncamed cnhriform fascia. The crihriform fascia ^ is connected with the sheath of the femoral vessels, and forms one of f the coverings of femoral hernia. When the iliac portion of -the fascia i lata is removed from its attachment to Poupart’s ligament and is t / r l I \ A h turned aside, the sheath of the femoral vessels (the femoral or crural canal) is brought into view ; and if Poupart’s ligament be carefully- divided, the sheath may be isolated, and its continuation with the transversalis and iliac fascia clearly demonstrated. In this view the sheath of the femoral vessels is an infundibiliform continuation of the abdominal fasciae, closely adherent to the vessels a little way down the thigh, but much larger than the vessels it contains at Poupart’s ligament. If the sheath be opened, the artery and vein will be found Ijdng side by side, and occupying the outer two-thirds of the sheath, leaving an infundibiliform interval between the vein and the inner * A section of the structures -which pass beneath the femoral arch. 1.

The superior opening of this space is named the femoral ring; it is bounded in front by Poupart’s ligament, behind by the os pubis, internally by Gimbernat's ligament, and externally by the femoral vein. The interval itself serves for the passage of the superficial lymphatic vessels from the saphenous opening to a lymphatic gland, which generally occupies the femoral ring; and from thence they proceed into the current of the deep lymphatics. The femoral ring is closed merely by a thin layer of subserous areolar tissue,* which retains the l}Tnphatic gland in its position, and is named septum crurale ; and by the peritoneum. It follows from this descrip- tion, that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the parietes of the abdomen, particular!}' in the female, where the femoral arch, or space included between Poupart’s ligament and the border of the pelvis, is larger than in the male, while the structures which pass through it are smaller. It happens consequently, that, if violent or continued pressure be made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced through the femoral ring into the infundibuli- form space in the sheath of the femoral vessels, carrying before it the peritoneum and the septum crurale,—this constitutes femoral hernia. If the causes which give rise to the formation of this hernia continue, the intestine, unable to extend further down the sheath, from the close connection of the latter with the vessels, will, in the next place, be forced forwards through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, car- r}'ing before it two additional coverings, the sheath of the vessels, or fascia propria, and the cribriform fascia ; and then curving upwards over Poupart’s ligament, the hernia will become placed beneath the superficial fascia and integument. The direction which femoral hernia takes in its descent is at first downicards, then foncards, and then upwards ; and in endeavouring to reduce it, the application of the taxis must have reference to this course, and be directed in precisely the reverse order. The coverings of femoral hernia are, the Integument, Superficial fascia. Cribriform fascia. Fascia propria. Septum crurale. Peritoneal sac. The Fascia of the Leg is strong in the anterior tibial region, and gives origin by its inner surface to the upper part of the tibialis anti- cus, and extensor longus digitorum muscles. It is firmly attached to the tibia and fibula at each side, and becomes thickened inferiorly into a narrow band, the anterior annular • ThLs areolar tissue is sometimes very considerably thickened by a deposit of fat within its areolae, and forms a thick stratum over the hernial sac. U200 FASCIili OF THE LEG. ligament, beneath which the tendons of the extensor muscles ])ass into the dorsum of tlie foot, in distinct sheaths lined by synovial bursoi. Upon the outer side it forms a distinct sheath which envelopes the peronei muscles, and ties them to the fibula. The anterior annular ligament is attached by one extremity to the outer side of the os calcis, and divides in front of the joint into two bands ; one of which is in- serted into the inner malleolus, while the other spreads over the inner side of the foot, and becomes continuous with the internal portion of the plantar fascia. The fascia of the dorsum of the foot is a thin layer given off from the lower border of the anterior annular ligament; it is continuous at each side with the lateral portions of the plantar fascia. The fascia of the posterior part of the leg is much thinner than the anterior, and consists of two layers, superficial and deep. The super- ficial layer is continuous with the posterior fascia of the thigh, and is increased in thickness upon the outer side of the leg by an expansion derived from the tendon of the biceps ; it terminates inferiorly in the external and internal annular ligaments. The deep layer is stretched across between the tibia and fibula, and forms the intermuscular fascia between the superficial and deep layer of muscles. It covers in superiorly the popliteus muscle, receiving a tendinous expansion from the semi-mer.ibranosus muscle, and is attached to the oblique line of the tibia. The internal annular ligament is a strong fibrous band attached above to the internal malleolus, and helow to the side of the inner tuberosity of the os calcis. It is continuous above with the posterior fascia of the leg, and below with the plantar fascia, forming sheaths for the passage of the flexor tendons and vessels into the sole of the foot. The eoctemal annular ligament, shorter than the internal, extends from the extremity of the outer malleolus to the side of the os calcis, and serves to hind down the tendons of the peronei muscles in their passage beneath the external ankle. The Plantar fascia consists of three portions, a middle and two lateral. The middle portion is thick and dense, and is composed of strong aponeimotic fibres, closely interwoven with each other. It is attached posteriorly to the imier tuberosity of the os calcis, and terminates under the heads of the metatarsal bones in five fasciculi. Each of these fasciculi divides into two slips, which are inserted one on each side into the bases of the first phalanges of the toes, leaving an interval between them for the passage of the flexor tendons. The point of division of this fascia into fasciculi and slips, is strengthened b}*^ trans- verse bands, which preserve the solidity of the fascia at its broadest part. The intervals between the toes give passage to the digital arte- ries and nerves and to the lumbricales muscles. The lateral portions are thin, and cover the sides of the sole of the foot j they are continuous behind with the internal and external an-291 PLANTAR FASCIA. nular ligaments; on the inner side with the middle portion, and exter- nally with the dorsal fascia- Besides constituting a strong layer of investment and defence to the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the different muscles. A strong septum is given off from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fascia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groups, a middle and two lateral; and trans- verse septa are stretched between these to separate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive a part of their origin from the plan- tar fascia.292 CPIAPTER V. ON THE ARTERIES. The arteries are the cylindrical tubes which convey the blood from the ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. They are dense in sti-ucture, and preserve for the most part the cylindrical form when emptied of their blood, which is their condition after death: hence they were considered by the ancients as the vessels for the transmis- sion of the vital spirits,* and were therefore named arteries to contain air). The artery proceeding from the left ventricle of the heart contains the pure or arterial blood, which is distributed throughout the entire system, and constitutes with its returning veins the greater or systemic circulation. That which emanates from the right ventricle, conve3's the impure blood to the lungs ; and with its corresponding veins esta- blishes the lesser or pulmonary circulation. The whole of the arteries of the systemic circulation proceed from a single trunk, named the aorta, from which they are given off as branches, and divide and subdivide to their ultimate ramifications, constituting the great arterial tree which per\mdes by its minute sub- divisions every part of the animal frame. The mode in which the division into branches takes place is deserving of remark. From the aorta the branches, for the most part, pass off at right angles, as if for the purpose of checking the impetus with which the blood wmuld otherwise rush along their cylinders from the main trunk ; but in the limbs a very different arrangement is adopted; the branches are given off from the principal artery at an acute angle, so that no impediment may be offered to the free circulation of the vital fluid. The division of arteries is usually dichotomous, as of the aorta into the two com- mon iliacs, common carotid into the external and internal, &c.; but in some few instances a short trunk divides suddenly into several branches which proceed in different directions; this mode of division is termed an aoeis, as the thyroid and coeliac axis. In the division of an artery into two branches, it is obser\Td that the combined arese of the two branches are somewhat greater than that of the single trunk ; and if the combined arese of all the branches at the peripherj’- of the bodj^ were compared with that of the aorta, it would be seen that the blood, in passing from the aorta into the nu- merous distributing branches, was flowing through a conical space, of * To Galen is due the honour of having discovered that arteries contained blood, and not air.293 GENERAL ANATOMY OF ARTERIES. ■which the apex might be represented by the aorta, and tlie base by the smiace of the body. The advantage of this important principle in facilitating the circulation is sufficiently obvious ; for the increased channel which is thus provided for the current of the blood, serves to compensate for the retarding influence of friction, resulting from the distance of the heart and the division of the vessels. Communications between arteries are very free and numerous, and increase in frequency with the diminution in size of the branches; so that, through the medium of the minute ramifications, the entire body may be considered as one uninterrupted circle of inosculations, or anastomoses (ava between, aT'o(/.a, mouth). This increase in the fre- quency of anastomosis in the smaller branches is a provision for coun- teracting the greater liability to impediment existing in them than in the larger branches. Where freedom of circulation is of vital import- ance, this communication of the arteries is very remarkable, as in the circle of Willis in the cranium, or in the distribution of the arteries of the heart. It is also strikingly seen in situations where obstruction is most likely to occur, as in the distribution to the alimentary canal, around joints, or in the hand and foot. Upon this free communication existing everywhere between arterial branches is founded the prin- ciple of cure in the ligature of large arteries ; the ramifications of the branches given off from the artery above the ligature inosculate with those which proceed from the trunk of the vessel below the ligature ; these anastomosing branches enlarge and constitute a collateral circu- lation , in which, as is shewn in the beautiful preparations made by Sir Astley Cooper, several large branches perform the office of the single obliterated trunk. The arteries do not terminate directly in veins ; but in an inter- mediate system of vessels, which, from their minute size (about of an inch in diameter,) are termed capillaries (capillus, a hair). The capillaries constitute a microscopic network, which is distributed through every part of the body, so as to render it impossible to in- troduce the smallest needle point beneath the skin without wounding several of these fine vessels. It is through the medium of the capilla- ries, that all the phenomena of nutrition and secretion are performed. They are remarkable for their uniformity of diameter, and for the constant divisions and commimications which take place between them, without any alteration of size. They inosculate on the one hand with the terminal ramusculi of the arteries ; and on the other with the minute radicles of the veins. Arteries are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external or areolo-fibrous coat is firm and strong, and serves at the same time as the chief means of resistance of the vessel, and of connection to surrounding parts. It consists of condensed areolo- fibrous tissue, strengthened by an interlacement of glistening fibres • 1 have a preparation, shewing the collateral circulation in a dog, in which I tied the abdominal aorta; the animal died from over-feeding nearly two years after the operation.•204 STRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. which are partly longitudinal and partly encircle the cylinder of the tube in an oblique direction. Upon the surface the areobir tissue is loose, to permit of the movements of the artery in distention and con- traction. The middle coat is that upon which the thickness of the artery depends ; it is yellowish in colour, and so brittle as to be cut through by the thread in the ligature of a vessel. The internal coat is a thin serous membrane which lines the interior of the artery, and gives it the smooth polish which that surface presents. It is continuous with the lining membrane of the heart, and through the medium of the capillaries ivith that of the venous system. In intimate structure an artery is more complicated than the above description would imply. The internal coat, for example, is com- posed of two layers, and the middle of three, so that, wth the exter- nal coat, there are six layers entering into the composition of an artery. The innermost coat is a tesselated epithelium analogous to that of other serous membranes. The second coat from -within is a thin, rigid membrane, pierced with a number of round or oval-shaped holes, and supporting a thin layer of flat, longitudinal fibres. From these characters it has been denominated the fenestrated or striated coat. The third layer, which is the innermost part of the middle coat, is composed of flat, longitudinal fibres, analogous to those of organic muscle. The fourth layer, the thickest of the whole, is com- posed of muscular fibres of organic life, arranged in a circular direction around the vessel. The fifth, or outermost part of the middle coat is a thin layer of elastic tissue ; this is present only in the large arteries. The sixth is the external or areolo-fibrous coat. The arteries in their distribution through the body are included in a loose areolar investment which separates them from surrounding tissues, and is called a sheath. Around the principal vessels the sheath is an important structure ; it is composed of areolo-fibrous tissue, intermingled with tendinous fibres, and is continuous with the fasciae of the region in which the arteries are situated, as with the thoracic and cervical fasciae in the neck, transversalis and iliac fasciae, and fascia lata in the thigh, &c. The sheath of the arteries contains also their accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. The coats of arteries are supplied -with blood like other organs of the body, and the vessels which are distributed to them are named vasa vasorum. They are also provided with nerves ; but the mode of distribution of the nerves is at present rmkuown. In the consideration of the arteries, we shall first describe the aorta, and the branches of that tnink with their subdivisions, which toge- ther constitute the efferent portion of the systemic circulation ; and then the pulmonary artery as the efferent trunk of the pulmonary circulation.295 AORTA.

The AORTA arises from the left ventricle, at the middle of the root of the heart, and opposite the articulation of the fourth costal cartilage with the sternum. At its commencement it presents three dilatations, called the sinus aortici, which correspond with the three semilunar valves. It ascends at first to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into—ascending—arch —and descending aorta. Relations.—The ascending aorta has in relation with it, in front, the trunk of the pulmonary artery, thoracic fascia, and pericardium ; behind, the right pulmonary veins and artery ; to the right side, the Tight auricle and superior cava; and to the left, the left auricle and the trunk of the pulmonary artery.

Arch.—The upper border of the arch of the aorta is parallel \\dth the upper border of the second stemo-costal articulation of the right side in front, and the second dorsal vertebra behind, and terminates opposite the lower border of the third. The anterior surface of the arch is crossed by the left pneumogas- tric nerve, and by the cardiac branches of that nerve and of the sym- pathetic. The posterior surface of the arch is in relation with the bi- furcation of the trachea and great cardiac plexus, the cardiac nerves, left recurrent nerve, and the thoracic duct. The superior border gives off the three great arteries, viz. the iimominata, left carotid, and left subclavian. The inferior border, or concavity of the arch, is in rela- tion with the remains of the ductus arteriosus, the cardiac ganglion and left recurrent nerve, and has passing beneath it the right pulmo- nary artery and left bronchus.I ARCH OF THE AORTA.—THORACIC AORTA. 297 Plan of the Relations of the Arch of the Aorta.

I The Arteria innominata (fig. 118, No. 4) is the first artery given f, off by the arch of the aorta. It is an inch and a half in length, and ascends obliquely towards the right stemo-clavicular articulation, > where it divides into the right carotid and right subclavian artery. Itelations.—It is in relation, in front, with the left vena innomi- nata, the thymus gland, and the origins of the stemo-thyroid and stemo-hyoid muscles, which separate it from the sternum. Behind, with the trachea, pneumogastric nerve and cardiac nerves; externally, wth the right vena innominata and pleura ; and internally, with the origin of the left carotid. Plan of the Relations of the Arteria Innominata. In Front. Left vena innominata, Tbjmus gland, Stemo-thyroid, Stemo-hyoid. Behind. Trachea, Pneumogastric nerve. Cardiac nerves. The arteria innominata occasionally gives off a small branch, which ascends along the middle of the trachea to the thyroid gland. This branch was described by Neubauer, and Dr. Harrison names it the middle thyroid artery. A knowledge of its existence is important in : performing the operation of tracheotomy. Left Side.

The common carotid arteries the head,) arise, the right from the bifurcation of the arteria innominata opposite the right sterno- clavicular articulation, the le/l from the arch of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that the right carotid is shorter than the left; it is also more anterior; and, in consequence of proceeding from a branch instead of from the main trunk, it is larger than its fellow. The Right common carotid artery (fig. 118, No. 5) ascends the neck perpendicularly, from the right sterno-clavicular articulation to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the external and internal carotid. The Left common carotid (fig. 118, No. 11) passes somewhat ob- liquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the side of the neck, and thence upwards to a level with the upper border of the th}Toid cartilage, where it divides like the right common carotid into the ex- ternal and internal carotid. Relations.—The right common carotid rests, first, upon the longus colli muscle, then upon the rectus anticus major, the sympathetic nerve being interposed. The inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve pass behind it at its lower part. To its inner side is the trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and larynx ; to its outer side, and enclosed in the same sheath, the jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve ; and in front, the sterno-thyroid, stemo-hyoid, stemo-mastoid, omo-hyoid, and platysma muscles, and the descendens noni nerve. The left common carotid, in addition to the relations just enumerated, which are common to both, is crossed near its commencement by the left vena innominata ; it lies upon the trachea ; then gets to its side, and is in relation with the oesophagus and thoracic duct ; to facilitate the study of these relations, I have arranged them in a tabular form.

The External carotid artery ascends nearly perpendicularly from op- posite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and the meatus auditorius, where it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary artery. Relations.—In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides muscles ; by the hypoglossal nerve near its origin ; higher up it is situated in the substance of the parotid gland, and is crossed by the facial nerve. Behind, it is separated from the internal carotid bj' the stylo-pharyn- geus and stylo-glossus muscles, glosso-pharjmgeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

The Hyoid branch passes forwards beneath the thyro-hyoideus, and •is distributed to the depressor muscles of the os hyoides near their insertion. The Superior laryngeal pierces the thyro-hyoidean membrane, in company with the superior laryngeal nerve, and supplies the mucous : membrane and muscles of the lai’jmx, sending a branch upwards to the epiglottis. The Inferior laryngeal is a small branch which crosses the crico- : thyroidean membrane along the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. ■ It sends branches through the membrane to supply the mucous lining of the larynx, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The Muscidar branches are distributed to the depressor muscles of : the os hyoides and larynx. One of these branches crosses the sheath of the common carotid to the mider surface of the sterno-mastoid L muscle. 2. The Lingual artery ascends obliquely from its origin, it then passes forwards parallel with the great comu of the os hyoides ; thirdly, it ascends to the under surface of the tongue ; and, fourthly, runs forward in a serpentine direction to its tip (under the name of the ranine artery), where it terminates by inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. Relations.—The first part of its course rests upon the middle con- • stricter muscle of the pharynx, being covered in by the tendon of the ; digastricus and the stylo-hyoid muscle ; the second is situated be- tween the middle constrictor and hyo-glossus muscle, the latter sepa- ■ rating it from the hypoglossal nerve ; in the third part of its course it lies between the hyo-glossusrand genio-hyo-glossus ; and in the fourth , (ranine) rests upon the lingualis to the tip of the tongue. Branches.—Hyoid, Dorsalis linguae, Sublingual. The Hyoid branch runs along the upper border of the os hyoides, ■land is distributed to the elevator muscles of the os hyoides near their 0 origin, inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. The Dorsalis Ungues ascends along the posterior border of the hyo- r glossus muscle to the dorsum of the tongue, and is distributed to the t tongue, the fauces, and epiglottis, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The Siddingual branch, sometimes considered as a branch of bifurca- • tion of the lingual, runs along the anterior border of the hyo-glossus, land is distributed to the sublingual gland and to the muscles of theFACIAL ARTERY. 304 tongue. It is situated between the mylo-hyoideus and genio-liyo-glos- • sus, generally accompanies Wharton’s duct for a part of its course, and sends a branch to the frajnum linguiE. It is the latter branch which affords the considerable luemorrhage which sometimes follows the operation of snipping the frmnum in children. 3. Facial artery.—The Facial artery arises a little above the great cornu of the os hyoides, and descends obliquely to the submax- illary gland, in which it lies embedded. It then curves around the body of the lower jaw, close to the anterior inferior angle of the mas- seter muscle, ascends to the angle of the mouth, and thence to the angle of the eye, where it is named the angular artery. The facial artery is tortuous in its course over- the buccinator muscle, to accom- modate itself to the movements of the jaws. Relations.—Below the jaw it passes beneath the digastricus and stylo-hyoid muscles; on the body of the lower jaw it is covered by the platysma myoides, and at the angle of the mouth by the depressor anguli oris and zygomatic muscles. It rests upon the submaxillarj' gland, the lower jaw, buccinator, orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris proprius, and levator labii superioris alseque nasi. Its branches are divided into those which are given off below the jaw and those on the face : they may be thus arranged ;— Beloio the Jaw.—Inferior palatine. Submaxillary, Submental, Pterj'^goid. On the Face.—Masseteric, Inferior labial. Inferior coronarj', Superior coronary. Lateralis nasi. The Inferior palatine branch ascends between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, to be distributed to the tonsil and soft pa- late, and anastomoses with the posterior palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The Submaxillary are four or five branches which supply the sub- maxillary gland. The Submental branch runs forwards upon the mylo-hyoid muscle, under cover of the body of the lower jaw, and anastomoses with branches of the sublingual and inferior dental artery. The Pterygoid branch is distributed to the internal pterygoid muscle. The Masseteric branches are distributed to the masseter and bucci- nator muscles.305 OCCIPITAL. POSTERIOR AURICULAR. The Inferior labial branch is distributed to the muscles and integu- ment of the lower lip. The Inferior coronary runs along the edge of the lower lip, between the mucous membrane and the orbicularis oris ; it inosculates with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. The Superior coronary follows the same course along the upper lip, inosculating with the opposite superior coronary artery, and at the middle of the lip it sends a branch upwards, to supply the septum of the nose and the mucous membrane. The Lateralis nasi is distributed to the ala and septum of the nose. The Inosculations of the facial artery are very numerous : thus, it anastomoses with the sublingual branch of the lingiial, with the ascending pharyngeal and posterior palatine arteries, with the inferior dental as it escapes from the mental foramen, infra-orbital at the in- fra-orbital foramen, transverse facial on the side of the face, and at the angle of the eye with the nasal and frontal branches of the ophthalmic artery. The facial artery is subject to considerable variety in its extent; it not unfrequently terminates at the angle of the nose or mouth, and is rarely symmetrical on both sides of the face. 4. The INIastoid artery turns downwards from its origin, to be distributed to the stemo-mastoid muscle, and to the lymphatic glands of the neck ; sometimes it is replaced by two small branches. 5. The Occipital artery, smaller than the anterior branches, passes backwards beneath the posterior belly of the digastricus, the trachelo-mastoid and stemo-mastoid muscles, to the occipital groove in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. It then ascends between the splenius and complexus muscles, and divides into two branches which are distributed upon the occiput, anastomosing with the opposite occipital, the posterior auricular, and temporal arterj'. The hypoglossal nerve curves around this artery near its origin from the external carotid. Branches.—It gives off only two branches deserving of name, the . inferior meningeal and princeps cervicis. The Inferior meningeal ascends by the side of the internal jugular vein, and passes through the foramen lacemm posterius, to be distri- : buted to the dura mater. The Arteria princeps cervicis is a large and irregular branch. It descends the neck between the complexus and semi-spinalis colli, and ; inosculates with the profunda cervicis of the subclavian. This branch is the means of establishing a very important collateral circulation between the branches of the carotid and subclavian, after ligature of the common carotid artery. 6. The Posterior auricular artery arises from the external carotid, above the level of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and30G TRANSVERSALIS FACIEI TEMPORAL ARTERY. ascends beneath the lower border of the parotid gland, and behind the concha, to be distributed by two branches to the external ear and side of the head, anastomosing with the occipital and temporal arteries; some of its branches pass tlirough fissures in the fibro-cartilage, to be distributed to the anterior surface of the pinna. The anterior auricular arteries are branches of the temporal. Branches.—The posterior auricular gives off but one named branch, the stylo-mastoid, which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen to be distri- buted to the aquaeductus Fallopii and tympanum, 7. The Ascending pharyngeal artery, the smallest of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk near its bi- furcation, and ascends between the ■ internal carotid and the side of the pharynx to the base of the skull, where it divides into two branches; meningeal, which enters the foramen lacerum posterius, to be distributed to the dura mater ; and pharyngeal. It supplies the pharynx, tonsils, and Eustachian tube. 8. The Parotidean arteries are four or five large branches which are given off from the external carotid whilst that vessel is situated in the parotid gland. They are distributed to the structure of the gland, their terminal branches reaching the integument and the side of the face. 9. The Transversalis faciei arises from the external carotid, whilst that trunk is lodged within the parotid gland ; it crosses the masseter muscle, lying parallel with and a little above Stenon’s duct; and is distributed to the temporo-maxillary articulation, and to the muscles and integument of the side of the face, inosculating with the infra-orbital and facial artery. This arterj’^ is not unfrequently a branch of the temporal, 10. The Temporal artery is one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid. It ascends over the root of the zygoma; and, at about an inch and a half above the zygomatic arch, divides into an anterior and a posterior temporal branch. The anterior temporal is distributed over the front of the temple and arch of the skull, and anastomoses with the opposite anterior temporal, and with the supra- orbital and frontal artery. The posterior temporal curves upwards and backwards, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, with the posterior auricular and occipital artery. The trunk of the temporal artery is covered in by the parotid gland and by the attrahens aurem muscle, and rests on the temporal fascia. Branches.—Orbitar, Anterior auricular. Middle temporal. The OrUtar artery is a small branch, not alwaj's present, whichINTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 307 passes forward immediately above the zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, and inosculates beneath the orbicularis palpe- brarum with the palpebral arteries. The Anterior auricular arteries are distributed to the anterior por- tion of the pinna. The Middle temporal branch passes through an opening in the tem- poral fascia immediately above the zygoma, and supplies the temporal muscle inoscidating with the deep temporal arteries. 11. The Internal maxillary artery, the other terminal branch of the external carotid, has next to be examined. Dissection.—The Internal maocillary artery passes inwards behind the neck of the lower jaw to the deep structures in the face ; we re- quire, therefore, to remove several parts for the purpose of seeing it completely. To obtain a good view of the vessel, the zygoma should be sawn across in front of the external ear, and the malar bone near the orbit. Turn down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle. In doing this, a small artery and nerve will be seen crossing the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, and entering the masseter muscle (the masseteric). Cut away the tendon of the temporal muscle from its insertion into the coronoid process, and turn it upwards towards its origin; some vessels will be seen entering its under surface ; these are the deep temporal. Then saw the ramus of the jaw across its middle, and dislocate it from its articulation with the temporal bone. Be careful in doing this to carry the blade of the knife close to the bone, lest any branches of nerves should be injured. Next raise this por- tion of bone, and with it the external pterygoid muscle. The artery, together with the deep branches of the inferior maxillflry nerve, will be seen lying on the pterygoid muscles. These are to be carefully freed from fat and areolar tissue, and then examined. This arterj" (fig. 119, No. T2) commences in the substance of the parotid gland, opposite the meatus auditorius extemus; it passes in the first instance horizontally forward behind the neck of the lower jaw; next, curves around the lower border of the external pterygoid muscle near its origin, and ascends obliquely forwards upon the outer side of that muscle; it then passes between the two heads of the external pterj'goid, and enters the pterygo-maxillary fossa. Occasionally it passes between the two pter}'goid muscles, without appearing on the outer surface of the external pterygoid. In consideration of its course, this artery may be divided into three portions : maxillary, pterygoid, and spheno-maxillary. Relations.—The maxillary portion is situated between the ramus of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament, lying parallel with the auri- cular nerve ; the pterygoid portion between the external pterygoid muscle, and the masseter and temporal muscle. The pterygo-Tnaxillary portion lies between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and, in the spheno-maxillary fossa, is in relation with Meckel’s gan- glion.INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY 308 Branches.

Pterygo-maxillary Portion. Superior dental, In fra-orbital, Ptery go-palatine, Spheno-palatine, Posterior palatine. Vidian. The Tympanic branch is small, and not likely to be seen in an ordi- nary dissection; it is distributed to the temporo-maxillary articulation and meatus, and passes into the tympanum through the fissura Glaseri. The Inferior dental descends to the dental foramen, and enters the canal of the lower jaw in company with the dental nerve. Opposite the bicuspid teeth it divides into two branches, one of which is conti- nued onwards within the bone as far as the symphysis, to supply the incisor teeth, while the other escapes with the nerve at the mental fo- ramen, and anastomoses with the inferior labial and submental branch of the facial. It supplies the teeth of the lower jaw, sending small branches along the canals in their roots. The Arterii, meningea media ascends behind the temporo-maxillary articulation to the foramen spinosum in the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and entering the cranium, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch crosses the great ala of the sphenoid to the groove or canal in the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and divides into branches, which ramify upon the exter- nal surface of the dura mater, and anastomose with corresponding branches from the opposite side. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal bone, to the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of the arteria meningea media are distributed chiefly to the bones of the skuU ; in the middle fossa this artery sends a small branch through the hiatus Fallopii to the fa- cial nerve. The Meningea parva is a small branch which ascends to the fora- men ovale, and passes into the skull to be distributed to the Gasserian ganglion and dura mater. It gives off a twig to the nasal fossae and soft palate. The Muscular branches are distributed, as their names imply, to the five muscles of the maxillary region; temporal branches (temporales profundae) are two in number. The Superior dental artery is given off from the internal maxillary.1 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 309 :ii just as that vessel is about to make its turn inwards to reach the spheno-maxillary fossa. It descends upon the tuberosity of the supe- rior maxillar}' bone, and sends its branches through several small fora- mina to supply the posterior teeth of the upper jaw, and the antrum. The terminal branches are continued forwards upon the alveolar pro- cess, to be distributed to the gums and to the sockets of the teeth. The Infm-orhital would appear, from its size, to be the proper con- tinuation of the artery. It runs idong the infra-orbital canal with the superior maxillary nerve, sending branches into the orbit and down- wards, through canals in the bone, to supply the mucous lining of the antrum and the teeth of the upper jaw, and it emerges on the face at the infra-orbital foramen. The branch which supplies the incisor teeth is the anterior dental artery ; on the face the infra-orbital inosculates with the facial and transverse facial arteries. The Pterygopalatine is a small branch which passes through the pterj'go-palatine canal, and supplies the upper part of the pharynx and Eustachian tube. The Spheno-palatine, or nasal, enters the superior meatus of the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen, in company with the nasal branches of Meckel’s ganglion, and divides into two branches ; one of which is distributed in the mucous membrane of the septum, while the other supplies the mucous membrane of the lateral wall of the nares, together with the sphenoid and ethmoid cells. The Posterior palatine artery descends along the posterior palatine canal, in company mth the posterior palatine branches of Meckel’s ganglion, to the posterior palatine foramen ; it then curves forward, lying in a groove upon the bone, and is distributed to the palate. While in the posterior palatine canal it sends a branch backwards, through the small posterior palatine foramen, to supply the soft palate, and anteriorly it distributes a branch to the anterior palatine canal, which reaches the nares and inosculates with the branches of the spheno-palatine artery. The Vidian branch passes backwards along the pterygoid canal,'and is distributed to the sheath of the Vidian nerve, and to the Eustachian tube. INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The internal carotid artery curves slightly outwards from the bifur- cation of the common carotid, and then ascends nearly perpendicularly through the maxillo-pharyngeal space * to the carotid foramen in the petrous bone. It next passes imvards, along the carotid canal, for- wards by the side of the sella turcica, and upuurds by the anterior clinoid process, where it pierces the dura mater, and divides into three terminal branches. The course of this artery is remarkable for the tfl number of angular curves which it forms; one or two of these flexures » * For the boundaries of this space see page 189.310 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. are sometimes seen in the cervical portion of the vessel, near the base of the skull; and by the side of the sella turcica it resembles the italic letter s, placed horizontally. Relations,—In consideration of its connections, the artery is divi- sible into a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral portion. The Cervical portion is in relation posteriorly with the rectus anticus major, sympathetic nerve, pharj-ngeal and laryngeal nerves which cross behind it, and near the carotid foramen with the glosso-pharyn- geal, pneumogastric, and hypoglossal nerves, and partially with the internal jugular vein, hiternally it is in relation with the side of the pharynx, the tonsil, and the ascending pharyngeal artery. Externally with the internal jugular vein, glosso-pharj’ngeal, pneumogastric, and hypo-glossal nerves ; and in front with the stylo-glossus, and stylo- pharyngeus muscle, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and parotid gland.

The Petrous portion is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a lining of dura mater'; it is in relation with the carotid plexus, and is covered in by the Gasserian ganglion. The Cavernous portion is situated in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, and is in relation by its outer side with the lining membrane of the sinus, the sixth nerve, and the ascending branches of the carotid plexus. The third, fourth, and ophthalmic nerves are placed in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, and are separated from the artery b}' the lining membrane of the sinus. The Cer^ral portion of the artery is enclosed in a sheath of the arachnoid, and is in relation with the optic nerve. At its point of division it is situated in the fissure of Sylvius.311 OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. Branches.—The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches : from the other portions are derived the following ;— Tympanic, Anterior meningeal, Ophthalmic, Anterior cerebral. Middle cerebral, Posterior communicating, Choroidean. The Tympanic is a small branch which enters the tympanum through a minute foramen in the carotid canal. The Anterior meningeal is distributed to the dura mater and Gasse- rian ganglion. The Ophthalmic artery arises from the cerebral portion of the inter- nal carotid, and enters the orbit through the foramen opticum, imme- diately to the outer side of the optic nerve. It then crosses the optic nerve'to the inner wall of the orbit, and runs along the lower border of the superior oblique muscle, to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal branches, the frontal and nasal. Branches.—The branches of the ophthalmic artery may be arranged into two groups : first, those distributed to the orbit and suiTOunding parts ; and, secondly, those which supply the muscles and globe of the eye. They are— First Group. Lachrymal, Supra-orbital, Posterior ethmoidal, Anterior ethmoidal. Palpebral, Frontal, Nasal. The Lachrymal is the first branch of the ophthalmic artery, and is usually given off immediately before that artery enters the optic fora- men. It follows the course of the lachrjonal nerve, along the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. The small branches which escape from the gland supply the conjunctiva and upper eyelid. The lachrymal artery gives off a malar branch which passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa and inosculates with the deep temporal arteries, while some of its branches become subcutaneous on the cheek, and anastomose with the transverse facial. The Supra-orbital artery follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpebrse muscle; it passes through the supra- orbital foramen, and divides into a superficial and deep branch, which are distributed to the muscles and integument of the forehead, and to Second Group. Muscular, Anterior ciliary, Ciliary short and long, Centralis retinae/312 OrUTUALMlC ARTERY. the pericranium. At the supra-orbital foramen it sends a branch in- wards to the diploe. Tlie Ethmoidal arteries, posterior and anterior, pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and are distributed to the falx cerebri and to the ethmoidal cells and nasal fossm. The latter accompanies the nasal nerve. The Palpebral arteries, superior and inferior, are given off from the ophthalmic, near the inner angle of tlie orbit; they encircle the eye- lids, forming a superior and an inferior arch near the borders of the lids, between the orbicularis palpebrarum and tarsal cartilage. At the outer angle of the eyelids the superior palpebral inosculates with the orbitar branch of the temporal artery. The inferior palpebral artery sends a branch to the nasal duct. The Frontal artery, one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, emerges from the orbit at its inner angle, and ascends along the mid- dle of the forehead. It is distributed to the integument, muscles, and pericranium. The Nasal artery, the other terminal branch of the ophthalmic, passes out of the orbit above the tendo oculi, and divides into two branches; one of which inosculates with the angular artery, while the other, the dorsalis nasi, runs along the ridge of the nose, and is distri- buted to the integument of that organ. The nasal artery sends a small branch to the lachrymal sac. The Muscular branches, usually two in number, superior and in- ferior, supply the muscles of the orbit; and upon the anterior aspect of the globe of the eye give off the anterior ciliary arteries, which pierce the sclerotic near its margin of connection with the cornea, and are distributed to the iris. It is the congestion of these vessels that gives rise to the vascular zone around the cornea in iritis. The Ciliary arteries are divisible into three groups, short, long, and anterior. The Short ciliary are very numerous ; they pierce the sclerotic around the entrance of the optic nerve, and supply the choroid coat and ciliary, processes. The long ciliary, two in number, pierce the sclerotic on opposite sides of the globe of the eye, and pass forwards between it and the choroid to the iris. They form an arterial circle around the circumference of the iris by inosculating with each other, and from this circle branches are given off which ramify in the sub- stance of the iris, and form a second circle around the pupil. The an- terior ciliary are branches of the muscular arteries ; they terminate in the great arterial circle of the iris. The Centralis retinae artery pierces the optic nerve obliquely, and passes forwards in the centre of its cylinder to the retina, where it di- vides into branches, which ramify in the inner layer of that membrane. It supplies the retina, hyaloid membrane, and zonula ciliaris ; and, b}’’ means of a branch sent forwards through the centre of the vitreous humour in a tubular sheath of the hyaloid membrane, the capsule of the lens.313 SUBCLAVIAN ARTKRY, The Anterior cerebral artery passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain ; then curves back- wards along the corpus callosum to its posterior extremity. It gives branches to the olfactory and optic nerves, to the Under surface of the anterior lobes, the third ventricle, the corpus callosum, and the inner surface of the hemispheres. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected soon after their origin by a short anastomosing trunlc, the anterior communicating artery. The Middle cerebral artery, larger than the preceding, passes out- wards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into three principal branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes of the brain, and the island of Reil. Near its origin it gives off the numerous small branches which enter the substantia perforata, to be distributed to the corpus striatum. The Posterior Communicating artery, very variable in size, some- times double, and sometimes altogether absent, passes backwards and inosculates -ndth the posterior cerebral, a branch of the basilar artery. Occasionally it is so large as to take the place of the posterior cerebral a^terJ^ The Choroidean is a small branch which is given off from the in- ternal carotid, near the origin of the posterior communicating artery, and passes beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain to enter the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is distributed to the choroid plexus, and to the walls of the middle cornu. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The Subclavian artery, on the right side, arises from the arteria in- nominata, opposite the stemo-clavicular articulation, and on the left, from the arch of the aorta. The right is consequently shorter than the left, and is situated nearer the anterior wall of the chest ; it is also somewhat greater in diameter, from being a branch of a branch, in place of a division from the main tnmk. The course of the subclanan artery is divisible, for the sake of pre- cision and surgical obsen-ation, into three portions. The first portion of the right and left arteries differs in its course and relations in correspondence with the dissimilarity of origin of the respective arte- ries. The other two portions are precisely alike on both sides. The^rs< portion, on the right side, ascends obliquely outwards to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side it ascends perpendicularly to the inner border of that muscle. The second portion curves outwards behind the scalenus anticus ; and the third portion passes downwards and outwards beneath the clavicle, to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. Relations.—The first portion, on the right side, is in relation, in front, with the internal jugular and subclavian vein at their point of junction, and is crossed by the pneumogastric nerve, cardiac nerves.314 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY.—RKLATION.S. and phrenic nerve. Behind and beneath it is invested by the pleura, is crossed by tlie right recurrent laryngeal nerve and vertebral vein, and is in relation with the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The ■portion on the left side is in relation in front with the pleura, the vena innominata, the pneumogastric and phrenic ner\’es (which lie parallel to it), and the left carotid artery. To its inner side is the oesophagus ; to its outer side the pleura ; and hehirul^ the thoracic duct, longus colli, and vertebral column.

The profunda cervicis and superior intercostal frequently en- croach upon the second portion, and not unfrequently a branch or brcunches may be found proceeding from the third portion. The primary branches are five in number, the first three being ascending, and the remaining two descending; they are the— Vertebral, Thyroid axis, Profunda cervicis, Superior intercostal. Internal mammary. {Inferior thyroid, Supra-scapular, Posterior scapular, Superficialis cervicis. The Vertebral artery is the first and the largest of the branches of the subclavian artery ; it ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebrae, excepting the last; then winds backwards around the articulating process of the atlas ; and, piercing the dura mater, enters the skull through the foramen magnum. The two arteries unite at the lower border of the pons Varolii, to form the basilar artery. In the foramina of the transverse processes of the vertebrae the artery lies in front of the cenucal nerves. Dr. John Davy* has observed that, when the vertebral arteries differ in size, the left is generally the larger ; thus in ninety-eight cases he found the left vertebral the larger twenty-six times, and the right only eight. In the same number of cases he found a small band stretching across the cylinder of the basilar artery, near the junction of the two vertebral arteries, seventeen times, and in a few instances a small communicating trunk between the two vertebral arteries previ- ously to their union. I have several times seen this communicating branch, and have a preparation now before me in which it is ex- hibited. The Basilar artery, so named from its position at the base of the brain, runs forwards to the anterior border of the pons Varolii, where it divides into four ultimate branches, two to either side. Brandies.—The branches of the vertebral and basilar arteries are the following:— Vertebral, , Lateral spinal. Posterior meningeal, . Anterior spinal, Posterior spinal, . Inferior cerebellar. Basilar, Transverse, • Superior cerebellar, ■ Posterior cerebral. * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1839.317 POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY. The iMteml spinal branches enter the intervertebral foramina, and are distributed to the spinal cord and to its membranes. Where the vertebral artery curves around the articular process of the atlas, it gives oft’ several muscular branches. The Posterior meningeal are one or two small branches which enter the cranium through the foramen magnum, to be distributed to the dura mater of the cerebellar fossae, and to the falx cerebelli. One branch, described by Soemmering, passes into the cranium along the first cervical nerve. The Anterior spinal is a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side, on the front of the medulla oblongata. The artery formed by the union of these two vessels, descends along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, to which it distributes branches. The Posterior spinal winds around the medulla oblongata to the posterior aspect of the cord, and descends on either side, communicat- ing very freely with the spinal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries. Near its commencement it sends a branch upwards to the fourth ventricle. The Inferior cerebellar arteries wind around the npper part of the medulla oblongata to the under surface of the cerebellum, to which they are distributed. They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve in their course, and anastomose with the supe- rior cerebellar arteries. The Transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Varolii, and adjacent parts of the brain. One of these brandies, larger than the rest, passes along the eras cerebelli to be distributed to the anterior border of the cerebellum. This may be called the middle cerebellar artery. The Superior cerebellar arteries, two of the terminal branches of the basilar, ivind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are distributed to the upper surface of the cerebellum inosculating with the inferior cerebellar. This artery gives off a small branch which accompanies the seventh pair of nerves into the meatus auditorius intemus. The Posterior cerebral arteries, the other two terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri at each side, and are dis- tributed to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. They are separated from the superior cerebellar arteries near their origin, by the third pair of nerves, and are in close relation with the fourth pair in their course around the crura cerebri. Anteriorly, near their origin, they give off a tuft of small vessels which enter the locus perforatus, and they re- ceive the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid. They also send a branch to the velum interpositum and plexus cho- roides. The communications established between the anterior cerebral arteries in front, and the internal carotids and posterior cerebral arteries behind, by the communicating arteries, constitute the circle of Willis. This remarkable communication at the base of the brain is318 CIRCLE OF WILLIS. formed by the anterior communicating branch, anterior cerebrals, and internal carotid arteries in front, and by the posterior communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery behind.

The Inferior thyroid artery ascends obliquely in a serpentine course behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, to the inferior part of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed ; it sends branches also to the trachea, lower part of the larynx, and oesophagus. It is in re- lation with the middle cerrical ganglion of the sympathetic, which lies in front of it. The Supra-scapular artery (transversalis humeri) passes ob- liquely outwards behind the clavicle, and over the ligament of the •supra-scapular notch, to the supra-spinatus fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus muscle, phrenic nerve, and subclavian artery, is distributed to the muscles on the dorsum of the scapula, and inosculates with the posterior scapular, and beneath the acromion pro- cess with the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. At the supra- scapular notch it sends a large branch to the trapezius muscle. The supra-scapular artery is not unfirequently a branch of the subclavian. The Posterior scapular artery (transversalis colli) • passes transversely across the subclavian triangle at the root of the neck, to the superior angle of the scapula. It then descends along the posterior border of that bone to its inferior angle, where it inosculates with the subscapular arterj*^, a branch of the axillary. In its course across the neck it passes in front of the scalenus anticus, and across the brachial plex'us; in the rest of its course it is covered in by the trapezius, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideus minor, and rhomboideus major muscles. Sometimes it passes behind the scalenus anticus, and between the nerves, which constitute the brachial plexus. This artery, which is verj^ irregular in its origin, proceeds more frequently from the third portion of the subclavian artery than from the first. The posterior scapular gives branches to the neck, and opposite the angle of the scapula inosculates with the profunda cervicis. It sup- plies the muscles along the posterior border of the scapula, and estab- ■ lishes an important anastomotic communication between the branches if the external carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The SuperFiciALis cervicis artery (cervicalis anterior) is a : jmall vessel, which ascends upon the anterior tubercles of the trans- t verse processes of the cervical vertebrae, lying in the groove between rthe scalenus anticus and rectus anticus major. It is distributed to the i- leep muscles and glands of the neck, and sends branches through the ! ntervertebral foramina to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The Profunda cervicis (cervicalis posterior) passes backwards letween the transverse processes of the seventh cerrical and first dor- mi vertebrae, and then ascends tlie back part of the neck, between the320 INTKHNAI. MAMMAIiy ARTERY. complcxus and senii-spinalis colli muscles. It inosculates above with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery, and below, by a descending branch, with the posterior scapular. The Superior intercostal artery descends behind the pleura upon the necks of the first two ribs, and inosculates with the first aortic intercostal. It gives off two branches which supply the first two inter- costal spaces. The Internal mammary artery descends by the side of the sternum, resting against the costal cartilages, to the diaphragm; it then pierces the anterior fibres of the diaphragm ; and enters the sheath of the rectus, where it inosculates with the epigastric artery, a branch of the external iliac. In the upper part of its course it is crossed by the phrenic nerve, and lower doivn lies between the triangularis stemi and the internal intercostal muscles. The Brandies of the internal mammary are,— Anterior intercostal, Mammary, Comes nervi phrenici, Mediastinal, Pericardiac, Musculo-phrenic. The Anterior intercostals supply the intercostal muscles of the front of the chest, and inosculate with the aortic intercostal arteries. Each of the first three anterior intercostals gives off a large branch to the mammar}^ gland, which anastomoses freely with the thoracic branches of the axillary artery; the corresponding branches from the remaining intercostals supply the integument and pectoralis major muscle. There are usually two anterior intercostal arteries in each space. The Comes nervi phrenici is a long and slender branch which accom- panies the phrenic nerve. The mediastinal and pericardiac branches are small vessels distri- ^ buted to the anterior mediastinum, the thymus gland, and pericar- dium. The Musculo-phrenic artery winds along the attachment of the dia- phragm to the ribs, supplying that muscle, and sending branches to . the inferior intercostal spaces. “ The mammary arteries,” says Dr. Harrison, “ are remarkable for the number of their inosculations, and for the distant parts of the arterial system which they serve to con- nect. They anastomose with each other, and their inosculations, with the thoracic aorta, encircle the thorax. On the parietes of this cavity their branches connect the axiUary and subclavian arteries; on the diaphragm they form a link in the chain of inosculations between the subclavian artery and abdominal aorta, and in the parietes of the ab- domen they form an anastomosis most remarkable for the distance be-321 AXILLARY ARTERY. tween those vessels which it serves to connect ; namely, the arteries of the superior and inferior extremities.” Varieties of the subclavian A rteries.—Varieties in these arteries are rare ; that which most frequently occurs is the origin of the right subclavian, from the left extremity of the arch of the aorta, below the left subclavian artery. The vessel, in this case, curves behind the (esophagus and right carotid artery, and sometimes between the oeso- phagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib on the right side of the chest, where it assumes its ordinary course. In a case* of subclavian aneurism on the right side, above the clavicle, which happened during the summer of 1839, Mr. Liston proceeded to per- form the operation of tying the carotid and subclavian arteries at their point of division from the innominata. Upon reaching the spot where the bifurcation should have existed, he found that there was no sub- clavian artery. With the admirable self-possession which distinguishes this eminent surgeon in all cases of emergency, he continued his dis- ■ section more deeply, towards the vertebral column, and succeeded in ■securing the artery. It was ascertained after death, that the arteria : innominata was extremely short, and that the subclavian was given oft" ■ within the chest from the posterior aspect of its trunk, and pursued a deep course to the upper margin of the first rib. In a preparation which was shewm to me in Heidelberg some years since by Professor Tiedemann, the right subclavian artery arose from the thoracic aorta, : as low down as the fourth dorsal vertebra, and ascended from that point to the border of the first rib. Varieties in the branches of the subclavian are not unfrequent ; the most interesting is the origin of ■ the left vertebral from the arch of the aorta, of which I possess several preparations. AXILLARY ARTERY. The axillary artery forms a gentle curve through the middle of the axillary space from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border :of the latissimus dorsi, where it becomes the brachial. Relations.—After emerging from beneath the margin of the costo- loracoid membrane, it is in relation with the axillary vein, which lies .'It first to the inner side, and then in front of the artery. Near the ; niddle of the axilla it is embraced by the two heads of the median i ierve, and is covered in by the pectoral muscles.

The relations of the axillary artery may be thus arranged ;— In Front, Pectoralis major, Pectoralis minor, Pectoralis major. hifier or Thoracic Side. Outer or Humeral Side. First intercostal muscle. Plexus of nerves. First serration of ratus magnus, Plexus of nerves. ser- Tendon of sub- scapularis, Coraco-biachialis. Branches.—The branches of the Axillary artery are seven in number:— Thoracica acromialis, Superior thoracic. Inferior thoracic, Thoracica axillaris, Subscapular, Circumflex anterior. Circumflex posterior. The thoracica acromialis and superior thoracic are found in the tri- langular space above the pectoralis minor. The inferior thoracic and : thoracica axillaris, below the pectoralis minor. And the three re- smaining branches below the lower border of the subscapularis. The Thoracica acromialis is a short trunk which ascends to the space above the pectoralis minor muscle, and divides into three branches, thoracic, which is distributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland ; acronual, which passes outwards to the acromion, and inoscu- lates with branches of the supra-scapular artery ; and descending, which follows the interspace between the deltoid and pectoralis major .muscles, and is in relation with the cephalic vein. The Superior thoracic (short) frequently arises by a common trunk • ivith the preceding ; it runs along the upper border of the pectoralis - ninor, and is distributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland, : nosculating with the intercostal and mammary arteries. The Inferior thoracic (long external mammary) descends along the ower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the chest. It is distributed to the pectoralis major and minor, serratiis magnus, and i ubscapularis muscle, to the axillary glands and mammary gland ; '.nosculating with the superior thoracic, intercostal, and mammary rteries. The Thoracica axillaris is a small branch distributed to the plexus : f nerves and glands in the axilla. It is frequently derived from one f f the other thoracic branches. The Subscapular artery, the largest of the branches of the axillary, :uns along the lower border of the subscapularis muscle, to the inferior : ngle of the scapula, where it inosculates with the posterior scapular, branch of the subclavian. It supplies, in its course, the muscles on he under surface and inferior border of the scapula, and the side of the I324 VAIIIETIKS OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY chest. At about an inch and a half from the axillarj', it gives off a large branch, the dprsalis scapula^ which passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and sca- pular head of the triceps, and beneath the infra-spinatus to the dorsum of the scapula, where it is distributed, inosculating with the supra- scapular and posterior scapular arteries. The Circumflex arteries wind around the neck of the humerus. The anterior, very small, passes beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and sends a branch upwards along the bicipital groove to supply the shoulder-joint. The Posterior drcumjlex, of larger size, passes backwards through the quadrangular space bounded by the teres minor and major, the scapular head of the triceps and the humerus, and is distributed to the deltoid muscle and joint. Sometimes this artery is a branch of the superior profunda of the brachial. It then ascends behind the tendon of the teres major, and is distributed to the deltoid without passing through the quadrangular space. The posterior circumflex artery sends branches to the shoulder-joint. Varieties of the axillary Artery.—The most frequent peculiaritj' of this kind is the division of the vessel into two trunks of equal size: a muscular trunk, which gives off some of the ordinarj’’ axillary branches and supplies the upper arm, and a continued trunk, which represents the brachial artery. The next most frequent variety is the high division of the ulnar which passes down the arm by the side of the brachial artery, and superficially to the muscles proceeding from the inner condyle, to its ordinarj^ distribution in the hand. In this course it lies immediately beneath the deep fascia of the fore-arm, and may be seen and felt pulsating beneath the integument. The high division of the radial from the axillary is rare. In one instance, I saw the axillary artery divide into three branches of nearly equal size which passed together down the arm, and at the bend of the elbow resolved themselves into radial, ulnar, and interosseous. But the most interesting variety, both in a physiological and simgical sense, is that described by Dr. Jones Quain, in his “ Elements of Anatomy.” “ I found in the dissecting-room, a few years ago, a variety not hither- to noticed ; it was at first taken for the ordinary high division of the ulnar artery. The two vessels descended from the point of division at the border of the axilla, and lay parallel with one another in their course through the arm ; but instead of diverging, as is usual, at the bend of the elbow, they converged, and united so as to form a short trunk which soon divided again into the radial and ulnar arteries in the regular way.” In a subject, dissected by myself, this variety ex- isted in both arms ; and I have seen several instances of a similar kind.325 BRACHIAL ARTERY. BRACHIAL ARTERY. j The Brachial artery passes do^vIl the inner side of the ann, from i the lower border of the latissimus dorsi to the bend of the elbow, I where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. I Belatims.—In its course downwards, it rests upon the coraco- j brachialis muscle, internal head of the triceps, brachialis anticus, and the tendon of the biceps. To its inner side is the ulnar nerve; to the outer side, the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles ; in front it has : the basilic vein, and is crossed by the median nerve. Its relations, within its sheath, are the venm comites. I ' Plan of the relations of the Brachial Artery. ! In Front. i Basilic vein, j Deep fascia, , Median nerve. Outer Side.

The branches of the brachial artery are, the— Superior profunda, Inferior profunda, Anastomotica magna. Muscular. The Superior profunda arises opposite the lower border of the latis- simus dorsi, and winds around the humerus, between the triceps and I the bone, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator ; longus, where it inosculates with the radial recurrent branch. It ac-. . companies the musculo-spiral nerve. In its course it gives off the pos- : terior articular artery, which descends to the elbow-joint, and a more ■ superficial branch which inosculates with the interosseous articular lartery. The Inferior profunda arises from about the middle of the brachial 1 artery, and descends to the space between the inner condyle and ole- ■ cranon in company with the ulnar nerve, where it inosculates with the : posterior ulnar recurrent The Anastomotica magna is given off nearly at right angles from the inner oiae.

It passes directly in- wards, and divides into two branches which inosculate with the ante- rior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries and with the inferior pro- fimda. The j\[itscular branches are distributed to the muscles in the course of the artery, ^dz. to the coraco-brachialis, biceps, deltoid, brachialis anticus and triceps. Varieties of the brachial Artery.— The most frequent peculiarity in the distribution of branches from this artery is the high division of the radial, which arises generally from about the upper third of the brachial artery, and descends to its normal position at the bend of the elbow. The ulnar artery sometimes arises from the brachial at about two inches above the elbow, and pursues either a superficial or deep course to the wrist; and, in more than one instance, I have seen the interosseous artery arise from the brachial a little above the bend of the elbow. The two profunda arteries occasionally arise by a com- mon trunk, or there may be two superior profundse. RADIAL ARTERY. The Radial artery, one of the divisions of the brachial, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that trunk. It runs along the radial side of the fore-arm, from the bend of the elbow to the wrist; it there turns around the base of the thumb, beneath its ex- tensor tendons, and passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand. It then crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar side of the hand, forming the deep palmar arch, and terminates by inosculating with the superficial palmar arch. In the upper half of its course, the radial artery is situated between the supinator longus muscle, by which it is overlapped superiorly, and the pronator radii teres ; in the lower half, between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis. It rests in its course downwards, upon the supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, radial origin of the flexor sublimis, flexor longus poUicis, and pronator qua- dratus ; and is covered in by the integument and fasciae. At the wrist it is situated in contact with the dorsal carpal ligaments and beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; and, in the palm of the hand, beneath the flexor tendons. It is accompanied by venae comites throughout its course, and by its middle third is in close relation with the radial nerve. profunda. 14. The superflcialis volae. 15. The ulnar artery. 16.

The Branches of the radial artery may be arranged into three groups, corresponding with the three regions, the fore-arm, the wrist, and the hand; they are— Fore-arm., Wrist, Hand, Recurrent radial, Muscular, ' Superficialis volse, Carpalis anterior, - Carpalis posterior, Metacarpalis, . Dorsales pollicis. fPrinceps pollicis, J Radialis indicis, I Interosseae, l^Perforantes. The Recurrent branch is given off immediately below the elbow; it ascends in the space between the supinator longus and brachialis anti- cus to supply the joint, and inosculates with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. This vessel gives off numerous muscular branches. The Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles on the radial side of the fore-arm. The Superficialis voice is given off from the radial artery while at the wrist. It passes between the fibres of the abductor pollicis muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. This artery is very variable in size, being sometimes as large as the continuation of the radial, and at other times a mere muscular ramusculus, or entirely wanting; when of large size it supplies the palmar side of the thumb and the radial side of the index finger.329 ulnar artery. The Carpal branches ai-e intended for the supply of the wrist, the anterior carpal in front, and the posterior, the larger of the two, behind. The carpalis posterior crosses the carpus transversely to the ulnar border of the hand, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Superiorly it sends branches which inos- culate with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery ; infe- riorly it gives off posterior interosseous branches, which anastomose with the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, and then run forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles. The Metacarpal branch runs forward on the second dorsal interos- seous muscle, and inosculates with the digital branch of the superficial palmar arch, which supplies the adjoining sides of the index and mid- dle fingers. Sometimes it is of lai'ge size, and the true continuation ' of the radial artery. The Dorsales pollicis are two small branches which ran along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb. The Princeps pollicis descends along the border of the metacarpal bone, between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis to the base of : the first phalanx, where it divides into two branches, which are dis- : tributed to the two sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb. The Radialis indicis is also situated between the abductor indicis and ; the adductor poUicis, and runs along the radial side of the index finger, forming its collateral artery. This vessel is frequently a branch of the princeps pollicis. The Interossew, three or four in number, are branches of the deep palmar arch ; they pass forward upon the interossei muscles, and in- osculate with the digital branches of the superficial arch, opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The Perforantes, three in number, pass directly backwards between -the heads of the dorsal interossei muscles, and inosculate with the posterior interosseous arteries. ULNAR ARTERY. The Ulnar artery, the other division of the brachial artery, crosses !:he arm obliquely to the commencement of its middle third ; it then ■uns down the ulnar side of the fore-arm to the wrist, crosses the an- lular ligament, and forms the superficial palmar arch, which terminates ' jy inosculating -with the superficialis volae. Relations.—In the upper or oblique portion of its course, it lies ;ipon the brachialis anticus and flexor profundus digitoram; and is f overed in by the superficial layer of muscles of the fore-arm and by fhe median nerve. In the second part of its course, it is placed upon 2 he flexor profundus and pronator quadratus, lying between the flexor aarpi ulnaris and flexor sublimis digitoram. While crossing the annu- 1* ir ligament it is protected from injur}’- by a strong tendinous arch, :hrown over it from the pisiform bone ; and in the palm it rests upon : he tendons of the flexor sublimis, being covered in by the palmaris330 ULNAR ARTERY.—HRANCHES. brevis muscle and palmar fascia.

Digi tales. : ■1 The Anterior ulnar recurrent arises immediate!}’’ below the elbow, and ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and ' brachialis anticus, where it inosculates with the anastomotica magna ' and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by ■ a common trunk. '1 The Posterior ulnar recurrent., larger than the preceding, arises im-.; mediately below the elbow joint, and passes backwards beneath the 1 origins of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends between 1 the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and beneath the ulnar nerve, \ and inosculates with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. i Fore-arm, Wrist, Hand,331 BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA. The Commoti interosseous artery is a short trunk which arises from the ulnar, opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. It divides into two branches, the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The Anterior interosseous passes down the fore-arm upon the inter- osseous membrane, between the flexor profundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, and behind the pronator quadratus. In the latter po- sition it pierces the interosseous membrane, and descends to the back of the wTist, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. It is retained in connection with the interos- seous membrane by means of a thin aponeurotic arch. The anterior interosseous artery sends a branch to the median nerve, which it accompanies into the hand. The median artery is sometimes of large size, and occasionally takes the place of the superficial palmar arch. The Posterior interosseous artery passes backwards through an opening between the upper part of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament, and is distributed to the muscles on the posterior .aspect of the fore-arm. It gives off a recurrent branch, which returns . upon the elbow between the anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaiis and ' supinator brevis muscles, and anastomoses with the posterior terminal ■ branches of the superior profunda. The Muscular branches supply the muscles situated along the ulnar border of the fore-arm. The Carped branches, anterior and posterior, are distributed to the anterior and posterior aspects of the wrist-joint, where they inosculate wth corresponding branches of the radial artery. The Digital branches are given off from the superficial palmar arch, and are four in number. The first and smallest is distributed to the ulnar side of the little finger. The other three are short trunks, which , divide between the heads of the metacarpal bones, and form the colla- teral branch of the radial side of the little finger, the collateral branches of the ring and middle fingers, and the collateral branch of the ulnar lb ' side of the index finger, ti Tlie Superjvcial palmar arch receives the termination of the deep ^palmar arch from between the abductor minimi digiti and flexor brevis minftni digiti near their origins, and terminates by inosculating with ::the superficialis volae upon the ball of the thumb. The communication f^-oetween the superficial and deep arch is generally described as the ■' 'ommunicating branch of the ulnar artery. The mode of distribution of the arteries to the hand is subject to I V requent variety. BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA. Bronchial, CEsophageal, Intercostal. The Bronchial arteries are four in number, and vary both in332 BRANCHES OP THE ABDOMINAX^ AORTA. size and origin. They are distributed to the bronchial glands and tubes, and send branches to the oesophagus, pericardium, and left auricle of the heart. These are the nutritious vessels of the lungs. The (Esophageal arteries are numerous small branches; they arise from the anterior part of the aorta, are distributed to the oeso- phagus, and establish a chain of anastomoses along that tube: the superior inosculate with the bronchial arteries, and with (esophageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries ; and the inferior with similar branches of the phrenic and gastric arteries. The Intercostal, or posterior intercostal arteries, arise from the posterior part of the aorta ; they are nine in number on each side, the two superior spaces being supplied by the superior intercostal artery, a branch of the subclavian. The right intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta. They ascend somewhat obliquely from their origin, and cross the vertebral column behind the thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and sympathetic nerve, to the inter- costal spaces, the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, the vena azygos minor and sympathetic. In the intercostal spaces, or rather, upon the external intercostal muscles, each artery gives off a dorsal branch, which passes back between the transverse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the middle costo-transverse ligament, and divides into a spinal branch, which supplies the spinal cord an(i vertebrae, and a muscular branch which is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back. The artery then comes into relation with its vein and nerve, the former being above and the latter below, and divides into two branches which run along the borders of conti- guous ribs between the two planes of intercostal muscles, and ana- stomose with the anterior intercostal arteries, branches of the internal mammary. The branch corresponding with the lower border of each rib is the larger of the two. They are protected from pressure during the action of the intercostal muscles, by little tendinous arches thrown across them and attached by each extremity to the bone. BRANCHES OF THE ABDOMIxVAL AORTA. Phrenic, Superior mesenteric. Spermatic, Inferior mesenteric, Supra-renal, Renal, Lumbar, Sacra media333 CCELIAC AXIS. HEPATIC ARTERY. The Phrenic arteries are given off from the anterior part of the aorta as soon as that trunk has passed through the aortic opening. Passing obliquely outwards upon the under surface of the diaphragm, each artery divides into two branches, an internal branchy which runs forwards and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the oesophageal opening ; and an external branch, which proceeds outwards towards the great circumference of the muscle, and sends branches to the supra-renal capsules. The phrenic arteries inosculate Avith branches of the internal mammary, inferior intercostal, epigastric, oesophageal, gastric, hepatic, and supra-renal arteries. They are not unfrequently derived from the coeliac axis, or from one of its divisions, and sometimes they give off the supra-renal arteries. The CcELiAc AXIS (*<i<x/a,Tentriculus) is the first single trunk given off from the abdominal aorta. It arises opposite the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra, is about half an inch in length, and divides into three large branches, gastric, hepatic, and splenic. Relations.—The trunk of the coeliac axis has in relation with it, m front the lesser omentum ; on the right side the right semilunar gan- glion and lobus Spigelii of the liver; on the left side the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac portion of the stomach ; and below, the upper border of the pancreas and lesser curve of the stomach. It is com- pletely surrounded by the solar plexus. The Gastric artery (coronaria ventriciili), the smallest,of the three branches of the coeliac axis, ascends between the two layers of the lesser omentum to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, then runs along the lesser curvature to the pylorus, and inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. It is distributed to the lower extremity of the oesophagus and lesser curve of the stomach, and anastomoses with the oesophageal arteries and vasa brevia of the splenic artery. The Hepatic artery curves forwards, and ascends along the right border of the lesser omentum to the liver, where it divides into two branches (right and left), Avhich enter the transverse fissure, and are distributed along the portal canals to the right and left lobes.* It is in relation in the right border of the lesser omentum, with the ductus communis choledochus and portal vein, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and numerous lymphatics. There are sometimes tAvo hepatic arteries, in which case one is derived from the superior mesenteric artery. The Branches of the hepatic artery are, the Pyloric, Gastro-duodenalis, Cystic. 5 Gastro-epiploica dextra, ( Pancreatico-duodenalis. * For the mode of distribution of the hepatic artery Avithin the liver, see the “ Minute Anatomy” of that organ in the Chapter on the Viscera.334 BRANCHKS OK THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. * The abdominal aorta with its branches. 1.

The Gaslro-duodenalis artery is a short but large trunk, which descends behind the pylorus, and divides into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra, and pancreatico-duodenalis. Previously to its division, it gives off some inferior pyloric branches to the small end of the stomach. The Gastro-epiploica dextra runs along the great curve of the stomach lying between the two layers of the great omentum, and inosculates at about its middle with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. It supplies the great curve of the stomach and the great omentum; hence the derivation of its name. The Pancreatico-duodenalis curves along the fixed border of the duodenum, partly concealed by the attachment of the pancreas, and is distributed to the pancreas and duodenum. It inosculates inferiorly with the first jejunal, and with the pancreatic branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The Cystic artery, generally a branch of the right hepatic, is of small size, and ramifies between the coats of the gall-bladder, pre- viously to its distribution to the mucous membrane. The Splenic artery, the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes horizontally to the left along the upper border of the pancreas, and divides into five or six large branches, which enter the hilus of the spleen, and are distributed to its structure. In its course it is tortuous and serpentine, and frequently makes a complete ■ turn upon itself. It lies in a narrow groove in the upper border of the ; pancreas, and is accompanied by the splenic vein, and by the splenic plexus of nerves. The Brandies of the splenic artery are the— Pancreaticse parvse, Pancreatica magna, Vasa brevia, Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The PancreaticcB parvae are numerous small branches distributed to t the pancreas, as the splenic artery runs along its upper border. One c jf these, larger than the rest, follows the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called pancreatica magna. The Vasa brevia are five or six branches of small size which pass rrom the extremity of the splenic artery and its terminal branches, oetween the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of ;he stomach, to which they are distributed, inosculating with branches if the gastric artery and gastro-epiploica sinistra.

The Vasa intcstini tenuis arise from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery. They vary from fifteen to twenty in number, and are distributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the termi- nation of the ileum. In their course between the layers of the mesen- tery, they form a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches ; from these are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches arise which are distributed to the coats of the intestine. From the middle branches a fourth and sometimes even a fifth series of arches is produced. By means of these arches a direct communication is established between all the branches given off from the convexity of the superior mesen- teric artery ; the superior branches moreover supply the pancreas and duodenum, and inosculate with the pancreatico-duodenalis; and the inferior mth the ileo-coUca. The Ileo-colic artery is the last branch given off from the concavity of the superior mesenteric. It descends to the right iliac fossa, and divides into branches which communicate and form arches, from which branches are distributed to the termination of the ileum, the caecum, and the commencement of the colon. This artery inosculates on the one hand with the last branches of the vasa intestini tenuis, and on the other with the colica dextra. The Colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and divides into branches which form arches, and are distributed to the ascending colon. Its descending branches inosculate with the ileo-colica, and the ascending with the colica media. The Colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passes forwards between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, where it forms arches, and is distributed to the transverse colon. It inosculates on the right with the colica dextra ; and on the left with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesen- teric artery. The Spermatic arteries are two small vessels which arise fi-om the front of the aorta below the superior mesenteric ; from this origin each artery passes obliquely outwards, and accompanies the corre- sponding ureter along the front of the psoas muscle to the border of the pelvis, where it is in relation mth the external iliac artery. It is then di- rected outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and follows the course of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal and through the scrotum to the testicle, to which it is distributed. The right spermatic arterySPERMATIC ARTERIES. 339 lies in front of the vena cava, and both vessels are accompanied by their corresponding veins and by the spermatic plexuses of nerves.

LUMBAR ARTERIES. 340 The spermatic arteries in the female descend into the pelvis and pass between the two layers of the broad ligaments of the uterus, to be distributed to the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, and round ligaments ; along the latter they are continued to the inguinal canal and labium at each side. They inosculate with the uterine arteries. The Inferior mesenteric artery, smaller than the superior, arises from the abdominal aorta, about two inches below the origin of that vessel, and descends between the layers of the left mesocolon, to the left iliac fossa, where it divides into three branches: Colica sinistra, Sigmoideae, Superior hsemorrhoidal. The Colica sinistra is distributed to the descending colon, and as- cends to inosculate with the colica media. This is the largest arterial inosculation in the body. The SigmoidecB are several large branches which are distributed to the sigmoid flexure of the descending colon. They form arches, and inosculate above with the colica sinistra, and below with the superior hsemorrhoidal artery. The Superior luBmorrlioidal artery is the continuation of the inferior mesenteric. It crosses the ureter and common ihac arterj’’ of the left side, and descends between the two layers of the meso-rectum as far as the middle of the rectum to which it is distributed, anastomosing with the middle and external hsemorrhoidal arteries. The SupRA-RENAL are two small vessels which arise from the aorta immediately above the renal arteries, and are distributed to the supra-renal capsules. They are sometimes branches of the phrenic or of the renal arteries. The Renal arteries (emulgent) are two large trunks given off from the sides of the aorta immediately below the superior mesenteric artery; the right is longer than the left on account of the position of the aorta, and passes behind the vena cava to the kidney of that side. The left is someAvhat higher than the right. They divide into several large branches previously to entering the kidney, and ramify very mi- nutely in its vascular portion. The renal arteries supply several small branches to the supra-renal capsules. The Lumbar arteries correspond with the intercostals in the chest; thej’’ are four or five in number on each side, and curve around the bodies of the lumbar vertebrte beneath the psoas muscles, and di- vide into two branches ; one of which passes backivards between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the vertebrre and spinal cordCOMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. 341 and to the muscles of the back, whilst the other takes its course be- hind the quadratus lumborum muscle and supplies the abdominal muscles. The first lumbar artery runs along the lower border of the last rib, and the last along the crest of the ilium. In passing between the psoas muscles and the vertebrae, they are protected by a series of tendinous arches, which defend them and the communicating branches of the sjTnpathetic nerve from pressure during the action of the muscle. The Sacra media arises from the posterior part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the middle of the anterior surface of the sacrum to the first piece of the coccyx where it terminates by in- osculating with the lateral sacral arteries. It distributes branches to the rectum and anterior sacral nerves, and inosculates on either side with the lateral sacral arteries. Varieties in the Branches of the abdominal Aorta.—The phrenic arteries are very rarely both derived from the aorta. One or both may be branches of the coeliac axis ; one may proceed from the gastric artery, from the renal, or from the upper lumbar artery. There are occasionally three or more phrenic arteries. The coeliac axis is very variable in length, and gives off its branches irregularly. There are sometimes two or even three hepatic arteries, one of which may be derived from the gastric or even from the superior mesenteric. The colica media is sometimes derived from the hepatic artery. The spermatic arteries are very variable both in origin and number. The right spermatic may be a branch of the renal artery, and the left a branch of the inferior mesenteric. The supra-renal arteries may be derived from the phrenic or renal arteries. The renal arteries present several varieties in number ; there may be three or even four arteries on one side, and one onl}' on the other. When there are several renal arteries on one side, one may arise from the common iliac artery, from the front of the aorta near its lower part, or from the in- ternal iliac. COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. The abdominal aorta divides opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries. Sometimes the bifurcation takes place as high as the third, and occasionally as low as the fifth lumbar vertebra. The common iliac arteries are about two inches and a half in length ; they diverge from the termination of the aorta, and pass downwards and outwards on each side to the margin of the pelvis, opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis, where they divide into the internal and external iliac arteries. In old persons the common iliac arteries are more or less dilated and curved in their course. The Right common iliac is somewhat longer than the left, and forms a more obtuse angle with the termination of the aorta j the angle of bifurcation is greater in the female than in the male. Relations.—The relations of the two arteries are different on theINTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 342 two sides of the body. The right common iliac is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed at its bifurcation by the ureter. It is in relation posteriorly with the two common iliac veins, and ex- ternally with the psoas magnus. The left is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed by the rectum and superior haemorrhoi- dal artery, and, at its bifurcation, by the ureter. It is in relation be- hind with the left common iliac vein, and externally with the psoas magnus. INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The Internal Iliac Artery is a short trunk, varying in length from an inch to two inches. It descends obliquely to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk.

Relations.—This artery rests externally on the sacral plexus and on the origin of the pyriformis muscle ; posteriorly it is in relation with the internal iliac vein, and anteriorly with the ureter. Branches.—The branches of the anterior trunk are the— Umbilical, Jschiatic, Middle vesical, Internal pudic. Middle hsemorrhoidal, And in the female the— Uterine, Vaginal. And of the posterior tnink, the— Ilio-lumbar, Lateral sacral, Obturator, Gluteal. The umbilical artery is the commencement of the fibrous cord into which the umbilical artery of the fostus is converted after birth. In after life, the cord remains pervious for a short distance and constitutes the umbilical artery of the adult, from which the superior vesical artery is given off to the fundus and anterior aspect of the bladder. The cord may be traced forwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder to near its apex, whence it ascends by the side of the linea alba and urachus to the umbilicus. The Middle vesical artery is generally a branch of the umbilical, and sometimes of the internal iliac. It is somewhat larger than the superior vesical, and is distributed to the posterior part of the body of the bladder, the vesiculie seminales, and prostate gland. The Middle hcemorrhoidal artery is as frequently derived from the ischiatic or internal pudic as from the internal iliac. It is of variable size, and is distributed to the rectum, base of the bladder, vesiculae seminales, and prostate gland ; and inosculates with the superior and external haemorrhoidal arteries. The Ischiatic artery is the larger of the two terminal branches of the anterior division of the internal iliac. It passes downwards between the posterior border of the levator ani and the pyriformis, resting on the sacral plexus of nerves and lying behind the internal pudic arterj', to the lower border of the great ischiatic notch, where it escapes from the pelvis below the pyriformis muscle. It then de- scends in the space between the trochanter major and the tuberosity of the ischium in company with the ischiatic nerves, and divides into branches. Its branches within the pelvis are hcemorrhoidal which supply the rectum conjointly with the middle haemorrhoidal and sometimes take the place of that artery, and the inferior vesical which is distributed ■ to the base and neck of the bladder, the vesiculae seminales, andINTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY. 344 prostate gland. The branches externally to the pelvis, are four in number, namely, coccygeal, inferior gluteal, comes nervi ischiatici, and muscular branches. The Coccygeal branch pierces the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, and is distributed to the coccygeus and levator ani muscles, and to the integument around the anus and coccyx. The Inferior gluteal branches supply the gluteus maximus muscle. The Comes nervi ischiatici is a small but regular branch, which ac- companies the great ischiatic nerve to the lower part of the thigh. The Muscular branches supply the muscles of the posterior part of the hip and thigh, and inosculate with the internal and external cir- cumflex arteries, with the obturator, and mth the superior perforating artery. The Internal pudic artery, the other terminal branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, descends in front of the ischiatic artery to the lower border of the great ischiatic foramen. It emerges from the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen ; it then crosses the internal obturator muscle to the ramus of the ischium, being situated at about an inch from the margin of the tuberosity, and bound down by the obturator fascia ; it next ascends the ramus of the ischium, enters between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia lying along the border of the ramus of the os pubis, and at the symphysis pierces : the anterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, and, very much diminish- j ed in size, reaches the dorsum of the penis along which it runs, sup- : plying that organ under the name of dorsalis penis. j Branches.—The branches of the internal pudic artery within the ) pelvis are several small ramuscules to the base of the bladder, the vesiculsB seminales, and the prostate gland; and haemorrhoidal branches which supply the middle of the rectum, and frequently take the place of the middle haemorrhoidal branch of the internal iliac. The branches given off externally to the pelvis, are the External haemorrhoidal, Superficialis perinei, TransversaKs perinei, Arteria bulbosi, Arteria corporis cavernosi, Arteria dorsalis penis. The External hcemorrhoidal arteries are three or four small branches, given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They are distributed to the anus, and to the muscles, the fascia, and the integument of the anal region of the perineum. The Superficial penneal artery is given off near the attadiment of the crus penis ; it pierces the connecting layer of the superficial andINTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY, 345 deep perineal fascia, and runs forward across the transversus perinei muscle, and along the groove between the accelerator urinae and erector penis to the septum scroti, upon which it ramifies under the name of arteria septi. It distributes branches to the scrotum, and to the perineum in its course forwards. One of the latter, larger than the rest, crosses the perineum, resting on the transversus perinei muscle, and is named the transversalis perinei. The Artery of the hvlh is given off from the pudic nearly opposite the opening for the transmission of the urethra; it passes almost trans- versely inwards between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia, and pierces the anterior layer to enter the corpus spongiosum at its bulbous extremity. It is distributed to the corpus spongiosum. Fig. 129.* • Th® arteries of the perineum on the right side the superficial arteries are seen, and on the left the deep. 1.

The two terminal branches of the Internal pudic artery • one is seen entering the divided extremity of the crus penis, the arteiy of the corpus cavemosum; the other, the dorsalis penis, ascends upon the dorsum of theOBTUIIATOK artery. :u() The Artery^ of the corpus cavernosum pierces the crus penis, and runs forward in tlie interior of the corpus cavernosum, by the side of the septum pectiniforme. It ramifies in the parenchyma of the venous structime of the corpus cavernosum. Tlie Dorsal artery of the penis ascends between the two crura and symphysis pubis to the dorsum penis, and runs forward, through the suspensory ligament, in the groove of the corpus cavernosum to the glans, distributing branches in its course to the body of the organ and to the integument. , The Internal pudic artery in the female is smaller than in the male; its branches, with their distribution are, in principle, the same. The superficial perineal artery supplies the analogue of the lateral half of the scrotum, viz. the greater labium. The artery of the bulb sup- plies the meatus urinarius, and the vestibule ; the artery of the corpus cavernosum, the cavernous body of the clitoris, and the arteria dorsalis clitoridis, the dorsum of that organ. The Uterine and Vaginal arteries of the female are derived either from the internal iliac, or from the umbilical, internal pudic, or ischiatic arteries. The former are very tortuous in their course, and ascend between the layers of the broad ligament, to be distributed to the uterus. The latter ramify upon the exterior of the vagina, and supply its mucous membrane. Branches of the posterior trunk. The Ilio-lumbar artery ascends beneath the external iliac ves- sels and psoas muscle, to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, where it divides into two branches, a luinbar branch which supplies i the psoas and iliacus muscles, and sends a ramuscule through the fifth intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and its membranes; and an j iliac branch which passes along the crest of the ilium, distributing branches to the iliacus and abdominal muscles, and inosculating with [ the lumbar and gluteal arteries, and with the circumflexa ilii. The Obturator artery is exceedingly variable in point of origin ; it generally proceeds from the posterior tnmk of the internal iliac artery, and passes forwards a little below the brim of the pelvis to the upper border of the obturator foramen. It there escapes from the pelvis through a tendinous arch formed by the obturator mem- brane, and divides into two branches; an internal branch which cmres inwards around the bony margin of the obturator foramen, between the obturator externus muscle and the ramus of the ischium, and dis- tributes branches to the obturator muscles, the pectineus, the adductor muscles, and to the organs of generation, and inosculates with the in- ternal circumflex artery; and an external branch which pursues its course along the outer margin of the obturator foramen to the space between the gemellus inferior and quadratus femoris, where it inoscu-347 GLUTEAL ARTERY. latcs with the ischiatic arterj% In its course backwards it anastomoses with the internal circumflex, and sends a branch througli th§ notch in the acetabidum to the hip-joint. Within the pelvis the obturator arterj' gives off a branch to the iliacus muscle, and a small ramuscule which inosculates with the epigastric arter\\ The Lateral sacral arteries are generally two in number on each side ; superior and inferior. The superior passes inwards to the flrst sacral foramen, and is distributed to the contents of the spinal canal, from which it escapes by the posterior sacral foramen, and sup- plies the integiunent on the dorsum of the sacrum. The inferior passes down by the side of the anterior sacral foramina to the coccyx ; it first pierces and then rests upon the origin of the pyriformis, and sends branches into the sacral canal to supply the sacral nerves. Both arteries inosculate with each other and with the sacra media. The Gluteal artery is the continuation of the posterior tnink of the internal iliac: it passes backwards between the lumbo-sacral and first lumbar nerve through the upper part of the great sacro*- ischiatic foramen and above the pyriformis muscle, and divides into three branches, superficial, deep superior, and deep inferior. The Superficial hranch is directed forwards, between the gluteus maximus and medius, and divides into numerous branches, which are distributed to the upper part of the gluteus maximus and to the inte- gument of the gluteal region. The Deep superior branch passes along the superior curved line of the ilium, between the gluteus medius and minimus to the anterior superior spinous process, where it inosculates with the superficial cir- cumflexa ilii and external circumflex artery. There are frequently two arteries which follow this course. The Deep inferior branches are several large arteries which cross the gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, where they inosculate with branches of the external circumflex artery, and send branches through the gluteus minimus to supply the capsule of the lip-joint. Varieties in the Branches of the internal iliac.—The most important )f the varieties occurring among these branches is the origin of the lorsal arterj' of the penis from the internal iliac or ischiatic. The •urter}' in this case passes forwards by the side of the prostate gland, nd through the upper part of the deep perineal fascia. It wo^d be mdangered in the operation of lithotomy. The dorsal artery of the >enis is sometimes derived from the obturator, and sometimes from ne of the external pudic arteries. The artery of the bulb, in its lormal course, passes almost transversely inwards to the corpus pongioBum. Occasionally, however, it is so oblique in its direction as 0 render its division in lithotomy unavoidable. The obturator artery lay be very small or altogether wanting, its place being supplied by a ranch from the external iliac or epigastric.348 EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY, The external iliac artery of each side passes oblifjuely downwards along the inner border of tlie psoas muscle, from opposite the sacro- iliac symphysis to the femoral arch, where it becomes the femoral artery. Relations.—It is in relation in front with the spermatic vessels, the peritoneum, and a thin layer of fascia, derived from the iliac fascia, which surrounds the artery and vein. At its commencement it is crossed by the ureter, and near its termination bj^ the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve and the circumflexa ilii vein. Externally it lies against the psoas muscle, from which it is separated by the iliac fascia ; and posteriorly it is in relation with the external iliac vein, which, at the femoral arch, becomes placed to its inner side. The artery is surrounded throughout the whole of its course by lymphatic vessels and glands. Branches.—Besides several small branches which supply the glands surrounding the artery, the external iliac gives off two branches, the— Epigastric, Circumflexa ilii. The Epigastrie artery arises from the external iliac near Poupart’s ligament; and passing forwards between the peritoneum and trans- versalis fascia, ascends obliquely to the sheath of the rectus. It enters the sheath near its lower third, passes upwards behind the rectus muscle, to which it is distributed, and in the substance of that muscle inosculates, near the ensiform cartilage, with the termination of the internal mammary artery. It lies internally to the internal abdominal ring and immediately above the femoral ring, and is crossed near its origin by the vas deferens in the male, and by the round liga- ment in the female. The only branches of the epigastric artery worthy of distinct notice are the Cremasteric, which accompanies the spermatic cord and supplies the cremaster muscle ; and the ramusculus which inosculates with the obturator artery. The Epigastric artery forms a prominence of the peritoneum which divides the iliac fossa into an internal and an external portion; it is from the former that direct inguinal hernia issues, and from the latter, oblique inguinal hernia. The Circumflexa ilii arises from the outer side of the external iliac, nearly opposite the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely along Poupart’s ligament, and curving around the crest of the ilium between the attachments of the internal oblique and transversalis muscle, inos- culates with the ilio-lumbar and inferior lumbar arterj\ Opposite the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, it gives off a lai^ ascending branch which passes upwards between tbe internal oblique and transversalis, and divides into numerous branches which supplyFEMORAL ARTERY. 34.9 the abdominal muscles, and inosculate with the inferior intercostal and with the lumbar arteries. ]'arieties in the branches of the external iliac.—The epigastric artery not unfrequently* gives off the obturator, which descends in contact with the external iliac vein, to the obtiu*ator foramen. In this situa- tion the artery would lie to the outer side of the femoral ring, and would not be endangered in the operation for dividing the stricture of femoral hernia. But occasionally the obturator passes along the free margin of Gimbemat’s ligament in its course to the obturator foramen, and would completely encircle the neck of the hernial sac,—a position in which it could scarcely escape the knife of the operator. In a preparation in my anatomical collection, the branch of communication between the epigastric and obturator arteries is very much enlarged, and takes this dangerous course. FEMORAL ARTERY. Emerging from beneath Poupai't’s ligament, the external iliac artery enters the thigh and becomes the femoral. The femoral artery passes down the inner side of the thigh, from Poupart’s ligament, at a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the Uium and the symphysis pubis, to the opening in the adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle with the inferior third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery. The femoral arterj^ and vein are enclosed in a strong sheath, femo- ral or crural canal., which is formed for the greater part of its extent by aponeurotic and areolar tissue, and by a process of fascia sent inwards from the fascia lata. Near Poupart’s ligament this sheath is much larger than the vessels it contains, and is continuous with the fascia transversalis and iliac fascia. If the sheath be opened at this point, the artery will be seen to be situated in contact with the outer wall of the sheath. The vein lies next the artery, being separated from it by a fibrous septum, and between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath, and divided from the vein by another thin fibrous septum, is a triangular interval, into which the sac is protruded in femoral hernia. This space is occupied in the normal state of the parts by loose areolar tissue, and by lymphatic vessels which pierce the inner wall of the sheath to make their way to a gland, situated in the femoral ring. Relatims.—The upper third of the femoral artery is superficial, being covered only by the integument, inguinal glands, and by the • The proportion in which high division of the obturator artery from the • epigastric occurs, is stated to be one in tliree. In two hundred and fifty subjects ► examined by Cloquet with a view to ascertain how frequently the liigh division took place, he found the obturator arising from the epigastric on both sides one hundred and fifty times; on one side twenty-eight times, and six times it arose : from the femoral artery.350 FEMORAL ARTERY, Fig. 130.* * A view of the anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, showing the course and branches of the femoral artery. 1.

To its outer side the artery is first in relation with the psoas and iliacus, and then with the vastus internus. Behind it rests upon tlie inner border of the psoas muscle ; it is next separated from the pectineus by the femoral vein, profunda vein and artery, and then lies on the adductor longus to its termination ; near the lower border of the adductor longus, it is placed in an aponeurotic canal, formed by an arch of tendinous fibres, thrown from the border of the adductor longus and the border of the opening in the adductor magnus, to the side of the vastus internus. To its inmr side it is in relation at its upper part with the femoral vein, and lower down with the pectineus, adductor longus, and sartorius. The immediate relations of the artery are the femoral vein, and two saphenous nerves. The vein at Poupart’s ligament lies to the inner side of the artery; but lower down gets altogether behind it, and incbnes to its outer side. The short saphenous nerve lies to the outer side, and somewhat upon the sheath for the lower two-thirds of its extent ; and the long saphenous nerve is situated within the sheath, and in front of the artery for the same extent.

The Superficial epigastric arises from the femoral, immediately below Poupart’s ligament, pierces the fascia lata, and ascends ob- liquely towards the umbilicus between the two layers of superficial fascia. It distributes branches to the inguinal glands and integument, and inosculates with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary artery. The Superficial external pudic arises near the superficial epigastric artery ; it pierces the fascia lata, at the saphenous opening, and passes transversely inwards, crossing the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument of the penis and scrotum in the male, and to the labia in the female. The Deep external pudic arises from the femoral, a little lower down than the preceding: it crosses the femoral vein immediately below the termination of the internal saphenous vein, and piercing the pubic portion of the fascia lata, passes beneath that fascia to the inner border of the thigh, where it again pierces the fascia ; having become superficial, it is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and perineum. The Profunda femoris arises from the femoral artery at two inches below Poupart’s ligament: it passes downwards and backwards and a little outwards, behind the adductor longus muscle, pierces the adductor magnus, and is distributed to the flexor muscles on the pos- terior part of the thigh. Relations.—In its course downwards it rests successively on the pectineus, the conjoined tendon of the psoas and iliacus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus muscles. To its outer side the tendinous insertion of the vastus intemus muscle intervenes between it and the femur ; on its inner side it is in relation with the pectineus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus; and in front it is separated from the femoral artery, above by the profunda vein and femoral vein, and bcloiv by the adductor longus muscle.PROFUNDA ARTERY. 353 Plan of the relations of the Profunda Artery.

Pectineus, Tendon of psoas and iliacus, A dductor brevis, Adductor magnus. Branches.—The branches of the profunda artery are, the external circumflex, internal circumflex, and three perforating arteries. The Eodernal drcumjkx artery passes obliquely outwards between the divisions of the crural nerve, then between the rectus and crureus muscle, and divides into three branches ; ascending, which inosculates with the terminal branches of the gluteal artery; descending, which inosculates Avith the superior external articular artery; and middle, which continues the original course of the artery around the thigh, and anastomoses with branches of the ischiatic, internal circumflex, and superior perforating artery. It supplies the muscles on the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The Internal circumflex artery is larger than the external; it winds around the inner side of the neck of the femur, passing between the pectineus and psoas, and along the border of the external obturator muscle, to the space between the quadratuS femoris and upper border of the adductor magnus, where it anastomoses with the ischiatic, ex- ternal circumflex, and superior perforating artery. It supplies the I r muscles of the upper and inner side of the thigh, anastomosing with : the obturator artery, and sends a small branch through the notch in It the acetabulum into the hip-joint. The Superior perforating artery passes backwards between the pec- I: tineus and adductor brevis, pierces the adductor magnus near the |f'femur, and is distributed to the posterior muscles of the thigh ; inos- L’cnlating freely with the circumflex and ischiatic arteries, and with the Ibbranches of the middle perforating artery. The Middle perforating artery pierces the tendons of the adductor j brevis and magnus, and is distributed like the superior; inosculating hwith the superior and inferior perforantes. This branch frequently r gives off the nutritious arterj’- of the femur. The Inferior perforating artery is given off below the adductor bre- .•is, and pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus, supplying it and |r,he flexor muscles, and inosculating with the middle perforating artery A APOPLITEAL ARTERY. :i54 iibove, and with the articular branches of the popliteal below. It is through the medium of these branches that the collateral circulation is maintained in the limb after ligature of the femoral artery. The Muscular hranclws are given off by the femoral arterj' through- out the whole of its course. They supply the muscles in immediate proximity with the artery, particularly those of the anterior aspect of the thigh. One of these branches, larger than the rest, arises from the femoral immediately below the origin of the profunda, and passing outwards between the rectus and sartorius divides into branches which are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thigh. This may be named the superior muscular artery. The Anastomotica magna arises from the femoral while in the ten- dinous canal formed by the adductors and vastus intemus. It runs along the tendon of the adductor magnus to the inner condyle, and inosculates with the superior internal articular arterj’; some of its branches are distributed to the vastus intemus muscle and to the crureus, and terminate by anastomosing with the branches of the ex- ternal circumflex and superior external articular artery. POPLITEAL ARTERY. The popliteal artery (Fig. 132) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial artery. Jtelations.— In its course downwards it rests first on the femur, then on the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, then on the fascia, cover- ing the popliteus muscle. Superficially it is in relation with the semi- membranosus muscle, next with a quantity of fat which separates it from the deep fascia, and iffiar its termination with the gastrocnemius, plaiitaris, and soleus; superficial and external to it is the popliteal vein, and still more superficial and external, the popliteal nerve. By its inner side it is in relation with the semi-membranosus, internal condyle of the femur, and inner head of the gastrocnemius; and b)' its outer side with the biceps, external condyle of the femur, the outer head of the gastrocnemius, the plantaris and the soleus.355 ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY.

Bratiches.—The branches of the popliteal artery, are the Superior external articular, Superior internal articular, Azygos articular. Inferior external articular. Inferior internal articular. Sural. The Superior articular arteries; eoctemal and internal, wind around the femur, immediately above the condyles, to the front of the knee- joint, anastomosing with each other, with the external circumflex, the anastomotica magna, the inferior articular, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the tendon of the biceps, and the internal through an arched opening beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus. They supply the knee-joint and the lower part of the femur. The Azygos articular artery pierces the posterior ligament of the joint, the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the synovial ; membrane in its interior. There are, frequently, several posterior ar- rticular arteries. The Inferior articular arteries wind around the head of the tibia ^immediately below the joint, and anastomose with each other, the :3uperior articular arteries, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the two external lateral ligaments of the oint, and the internal beneath the internal lateral ligament. Thej-^ uupply the knee-joint and the heads of the tibia and fibula. The Sural arteries (sura, the calf) are two large muscular branches, vhich are distributed to tlie two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. -INTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The anterior tibial artery passes forwards between the two heads f the tibialis posticus muscle, and through the opening in the upper356 ANTERIOR TIlilAL ARTERY.

It then nins down the anterior aspect of the leg to the ankle-joint, where it becomes the dorsalis pedis. Relations.—In its course do^vnwards it rests upon the interosseous membrane (to which it is connected by a little tendinous arch which is thro^\^l across it), the lower part of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the joint. In the upper third of its course it is situated between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum, lower down between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis ; and just before it reaches the ankle it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and becomes placed between that tendon and the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. Its immediate relations are the venae comites and the anterior tibial nerve, which latter lies at first to its outer side, and at fibout the middle of the leg becomes placed superfi- cially to the artery.

They supply branches to the ankle-joint. The Dorsalis pedis artery is continued forward along the tibial side of the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the meUt- tarsal bone of the great toe, where it divides into two branches, the dorsalis hallucis and communicating. Relations.—The dorsalis pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis; on its fibular side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near its termi- nation it is crossed by the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digito- rum. It is accompanied by venae comites, and has the continuation of the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. Plan of the relations of the Dorsalis Pedis Artery. In Front. Inner Side.

The Tarsea arches transversely across the tarsus, beneath the ex- tensor brevis digitorum muscle, and supplies the articulations of the tarsal bones and the outer side of the foot; it anastomoses with ihe external malleolar, the peroneal arteries, and the external plantar. The Metatarsea forms an arch across the base of the metatarsal bones, and supplies the outer side of the foot; anastomosing with the tarsea and with the external plantar arterj’’. The metatarsea gives off three branches, the interosseae, which pass forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles, and divide into two collateral branches for adjoining toes. At their commencement these interosseous branches receive'the posterior perforating arteries from the plantar arch, and opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones they are joined by the anterior perfora- ting branches from the digital arteries.POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 359 The Dorsalis hallucis runs forward upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, one of which passes inwards beneath the tendon of the extensor pro- prius pollicis, and is distributed to the inner border of the gi’eat toe, while the other bifurcates for the supply of the adjacent sides of the great and second toe. The Communicating artery passes into the sole of the foot between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the external plantar artery. Besides the preceding, numerous branches are distributed to the bones and articulations of the foot, particularly along the inner border of the latter. POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The posterior tibial artery passes obliquely downwards along the tibial side of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, where it divides into the internal and external plantar artery. Delations.—In its course downwards it lies first upon the tibialis posticus, next on the flexor longus digitorum, and then on the tibia ; it is covered in by the intermuscular fascia which separates it above from the soleus, and below from the deep fascia of the leg and the in- tegument. It is accompanied by its venae comites, and by the poste- rior tibial nen'e, which latter lies at first to its outer side, then super- ficially to it, and again to its outer side.

It then runs downwards along the inner border of the fibula to its lower third, Avhere it divides into the anterior and posterior peroneal artery. Relations.—The peroneal artery rests upon the tibialis posticus muscle, and is covered in bj* the soleus, the intermuscular fascia, and the fiexor longus pollicis, having the fibula to its outer side. Plan of the relations of the Peroneal Arter)\ In Front. Soleus, Intermuscular fascia, Flexor longus pollicis. Outer Side. Fibula. Peroneal Artery. Behind. Tibialis posticus. Branches.—The branches of the peroneal artery are, muscular to the neighbouring muscles, particularly to the soleus, and the two terminal branches anterior and posterior peroneal. The Anterior peroneal pierces the interosseous membrane at the lower third of the leg, and is distributed on the front of the outer malleolus, anastomosing with the external malleolar and tarsal artery. This branch is very variable in size. The Posterior peroneal continues onwards along the posterior aspect of the outer malleolus to the side of the os calcis, to which and to the muscles arising from it, it distributes external calcanean branches. It anastomoses with the anterior peroneal, tarsal, external plantar, and posterior tibial artery. The Nutritious artery of the tibia arises from the trunk of the tibial, frequently above the origin of the peroneal, and proceeds to the nutritious canal, which it traverses obliquely from below upwards. The Muscular branches of the posterior tibial artery are distributed to the soleus and to the deep muscles on the posterior aspect of the leg. One of these branches is deserving of notice, a recurrent branch, which arises from the posterior tibial above the origin of the peroneal ■ their origin.

The Internal calcanean branches, three or four in number, proceed from the posterior tibial artery immediately before its division ; they are distributed to the inner side of the os calcis, to the integument, and to the muscles wliich arise from its inner tuberosity, and they anastomose with tlie external calcanean branches, and with all the neighbouring arteries. PLANTAR arteries. The Internal plantar artery proceeds from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial at the inner malleolus, and passes along the inner Fig. 133.* * The arteries of the sole of the foot; the first and a part of the second layer of muscles having been removed. 1.

The Extemcd plantar artery, much larger than the internal, passes obliquely outwards between the first and second layers of the plantar muscles, to the fifth metatarsal space. It then turns horizontally in- wards between the second and third layers, to the first metatarsal space, where it inosculates with the communicating branch from the dorsalis pedis. The horizontal portion of the artery describes a slight curve, having the convexity forwards; this is the plantar arch. Branches.—The branches of the external plantar artery are the— IMuscular, Articular, Digital,—anterior perforating, Posterior perforating. The Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles in the sole of the foot. The Articular branches supply the ligaments of the articulations of the tarsus, and their synovial membranes. The Digital branches are four in number : the first is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; the three others pass forwards to the cleft between the toes, and divide into collateral branches, which sup- ply the adjacent sides of the three external toes, and the outer side of the second. At the bifurcation of the toes, a small branch is sent I upwards from each digital arterj', to inosculate with the interosseous branches, of the metatarsea ; these are the anterior perforating arte- 1 r ries. The Posterior perforating are three small branches which pass r upwards between the heads of the three external dorsal interossei I:-muscles to inosculate with the arch formed by the metatarsea |?.artery. . Varieties in the Arteries of the Lower Extremity.—The femoral aartery occasionally divides at Poupart's ligament into two branches, tind sometimes into three ; the former is an instance of the high iivision of the profunda artery; and in a case of the latter kind which Kcurred during my dissections, the branches were the profunda, the superficial femoral, and the internal circumflex artery. Dr. Quain, in tiis “Elements of Anatomy,” records an instance of a high division of l.he femoral artery, in which the two vessels became again united in ; he popliteal region. The point of origin of the profunda artery varies onsiderably in different subjects, being sometimes nearer to and some- i imes farther from Poupart’s ligament, but more frequently the former. IThe branches of the popliteal artery are very liable to variety in size; ' nd in all these cases the compensating principle, so constant in the ascular system, is strikingly manifested. When the anterior tibial is (f small size, the peroneal is large ; and, in place of dividing into two36'4 I'ULMONAJIV ARTERY. terminal branches at the lower third of the leg, descends to the lower part of the interosseous membrane, and emerges upon the front of the ankle, to supply the dorsum of the foot; or the posterior tibial and plantar arteries are large, and the external plantar is continued be- tween the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, to be distri- buted to the dorsal surface of the foot. Sometimes the posterior tibial artery is small and thread-like; and the peroneal, after descending to the ankle, curves inwards to the inner malleolus, and divides into the two plantar arteries. If, in this case, the posterior tibial be suffi- ciently large to reach the ankle, it inosculates with the peroneal pre- viousl}'^ to its division. The internal plantar artery sometimes takes the distribution of the external plantar, which is short and diminutive, and the latter not unfrequently replaces a deficient dorsalis pedis. The varieties of arteries are interestirig in the practical application of a knowledge of their principal forms to surgical operations ; in their transcendental anatomy, as illustrating the normal type of distribution in animals ; or, in many cases, as diverticula permitted by Nature, to teach her observers two important principles: —first, in respect to herself, that, however in her means she may indulge in change, the end is never overlooked, and a limb is as surely supplied by a leash of arteries, various in their course, as by those which we are pleased to consider normal in distribution ; and, secondly, with regard to us, that we should ever be keenly alive to what is passing beneath our observation, and ever ready in the most serious operation to deviate from our course and avoid—or give eyes to our knife, that it may see, —the concealed dangers which it is our pride to be able to contend with and vanquish. PULMONARY ARTERY. The pulmonary artery arises from the left side of the base of the right ventricle in front of the origin of the aorta, and ascends oblique!}' to the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries. In its course upwards and back- wards it inclines to the left side, crossing the commencement of the aorta, and is connected to the under surface of the arch by a thick and impervious cord, the remains of the ductus arteriosus. Relations.—It is enclosed for one-half of its extent by the pericar- dium, and receives the attachment of the fibrous portion of that mem- brane by its upper portion. Behind, it rests against the ascending aorta; on either side is the appendix of the corresponding auricle with a coronary artery; and above, the cardiac ganglion and the remains of the ductus arteriosus. The Right •pulmonary artery passes beneath the arch and behind the ascending aorta, and in the root of the lungs ditudes into three branches for the three lobes. The Left pulmonary artery, rather larger than the right, passes in front of the descending aorta, to the root of the left limg, to which it365 PULMONARY ARTERY. is distributed. These arteries divide and subdivide in the structure of the lungs, and terminate in capillary vessels which form a network around the air-passages and cells, and become continuous with the ra- dicles of the pulmonary veins. Relations. — In the root of the right lung, examined from above downwards, the pulmonary artery is situated between the bronchus and pulmonary veins, the former being above, the latter below; while in the left lung the artery is the highest, next the bronchus, and then the veins. Oa both sides, from before backwards, the artery is situ- ated between the veins and bronchi, the former being in front, and the latter behind.3G6 CHAPTER VI. OF THE- VEINS. The veins are the vessels which return the blood to the auricles of the heart, after it has been circulated by the arteries through the va- rious tissues of the body. They are much thinner in structure than the arteries, so that when emptied of their blood they become flat- tened and collapsed. The veins of the S3'stemic circulation convey the dark-coloured and impure or venous blood from the capillary sj'stem to the right auricle of the heart, and they are found after death to be more or less distended with that fluid. The veins of the pulmonary circulation resemble the arteries of the s_ystemic circulation in contain- ing during life the pure or arterial blood, which they transmit from the capillaries of the lungs to the left auricle. The veins commence by minute radicles in the capillaries which are everjwvhere distributed through the textures of the bodj’-, and con- verge to constitute larger and larger branches, till they terminate in the main trunks which convey the venous blood directly to the heart. In diameter they are larger than the arteries, and, like those vessels, their combined are® would constitute an imaginary cone, whereof the apex is placed at the heart, and the base at the surface of the bod}'. It follows from this arrangement, that the blood in returning to the heart is passing from a larger into a smaller channel, and therefore that it increases in rapidity during its course. Veins admit of a threefold division into, superficial, deep, and sinuses. The Superficial veins return the blood from the integument and su- perficial structures, and take their course between the layers of the superficial fascia ; they then pierce the deep fascia in the most con- venient and protected situations, and terminate in the deep veins. They are unaccompanied by arteries, and are the vessels usually se- lected for venesection. The Deep veins are situated among the deeper structures of the body, and generally in relation with the arteries ; in the limbs they tire enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and they return the venous blood from the capillaries of the deep tissues. In company with all the smaller, and also with the secondary arteries, as the brachial, radial, and ulnar in the upper, and the tibial and peroneal in the lower extremity, there are two veins, placed one on each side ofSTRUCTURE OF VEINS. 367 the artery, and named vena comites. The larger arteries, as the axillary, subclavian, carotid, popliteal, femoral, &c., ai’e accompanied by a single venous trunk. Sinuses differ from veins in their structure; and also in their mode of distribution, being confined to especial organs and situated within their substance. The principal venous sinuses are those of the dui-a mater, the diploe, the cancellous structure of bones, and the uterus. The communications between veins are even more frequent than those of arteries, and they take place between the larger as well as among the smaller vessels ; the veme comites communicate with each other very frequently in their course, bj' means of short transverse branches which pass across from one to the other. These communica- tions are strikingly exhibited in the frequent inosculations of the spinal veins, and in the various venous plexuses, as the spermatic plexus, vesical plexus, &c. The office of these inosculations is very apparent, as tending to obviate the obstructions to which the veins are particular!)' liable from the thinness of their coats, and from their in- ability to overcome much impediment by the force of their current. Veins, like arteries, are composed of three coats, external or areolo- fibrous, middle or fibrous, and internal or serous. The eodernal coat is firm and strong, and resembles that of arteries. The middle coat consists of two layers, an outer layer of contractile fibrous tissue dis- posed in a circular direction around the vessel, and an inner layer of organic muscular fibres arranged longitudinally. This latter resem- bles the inner layer of the middle coat of arteries, but is somewhat thicker ; it is not unfrequently hj'pertrophied. The internal coaU as in arteries, consists of a striated or fenestrated layer, and a layer of epithelium ; it is continuous with the internal coat of arteries through the medium of the lining membrane of the heart on the one hand, and through the capillary vessels on the other. The differences in structure, therefore, between arteries and veins, relate to the differ- ence of thickness of their component layers, and to the absence of the elastic coat in the latter. Moreover, another difference occurs in the presence of valves. The valves of veins are composed of a thin layer of fibrous membrane, lined upon its two surfaces by epithelium. The segments or flaps of the valves of veins are semilunar in form and arranged in pairs, one upon either side of the vessel ; in some in- stances there is but a single flap, which has a spiral direction, and occasionally there are three. The free border of the valvular flaps is ■ concave, and directed forwards, so that while the current of blood is ; permitted to flow freely towards the heart, the valves are distended : and the current intercepted if the stream become retrograde in its I course. Upon the cardiac side of each valve the vein is expanded : into two pouches (sinuses), corresponding with the flaps of the valves, which give to the distended or injected vein a knotted appearance. ' The valves are most numerous in the veins of the extremities, particu- ^ larly in the deeper veins, and they are generally absent in the very * small veins, and in the veins of the viscera, as in the portal and cere-3G8 VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. bi’cil veins : they are also absent in the large trunks, as in the venae cavae, venae azygos, innominatae, and iliac veins. Sinuses are venous channels, excavated in the structure of an org:in, and lined by the internal coat of the veins ; of this structure are the sinuses of the dura mater, whose external covering is the fibrous tissue of the membrane, and the internal, the serous layer of the veins. The external investment of the sinuses of the uterus is the tissue of that organ ; and that of the bones, the lining membrane of the cells and canals. Veins, like arteries, are supplied with nutritious vessels, the vasa vasorum ; and it is to be presumed that nervous filaments are distri- | buted in their coats. j I shall describe the veins according to the primary division of the i body ; taking first, those of the head and neck ; next, those of the I upper extremity ; then, those of the lower extremity ; and lastly, the j veins of the trunk. : VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. I The veins of the head and neck may be arranged into three groups, viz. 1. Veins of the exterior of the head. 2. Veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium. 3. Veins of the neck. The veins of the exterior of the head are the— Facial, Internal maxillary. Temporal, Temporo-maxillary, Posterior auricular. Occipital. The Facial vein commences on the anterior part of the skuU in a venous plexus, fomed by the communications of the branches of the temporal, and descends along the middle line of the forehead, under the name of frontal vein, to the root of the nose, where it is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a communicating trunk which constitutes the nasal arch. There are usually two frontal veins, which communicate by a transverse inosculation ; but sometimes the vein is single and bifurcates at the root of the nose, into the two an- gular veins. From the nasal arch, the frontal is continued downwards by the side of the root of the nose, under the name of the angular vein ; it then passes beneath the zygomatic muscles and becomes the facial vein, and descends along the anterior border of the masseter muscle, crossing the body of the lower jaw, by the side of the facial artery, to the submaxillary gland, and fi’om thence to the internal jugular vein in which it terminates. The branches which the facial vein receives in its course are, theVEINS OF THE DIPLOE. 36y siipra-orbital, which joins the frontal vein ; the dorsal veins of the nose which terminate in the nasal arch; the ophthalmic, which communi- cates with the angular vein ; the palpebral and nasal, which open into the anguhar vein ; a considerable trunk, the alveolar, which returns the blood from the spheno-maxillary fossa, from the infra-orbital, pala- tine, vidian, and splieno-palatine veins, and joins the facial beneath the zygomatic process of the superior maxillary bone, and the veins * corresponding with the branches of the facial artery. The Internal maxillary vein receives the branches from the zygo- matic and pterygoid fossre ; these are so numerous and communicate so freely as to constitute a pterygoid plexus. Passing backwards behind the neck of the lower jaw, the internal maxillary joins with the tem- poral vein, and the common trunk resulting from this union constitutes the temporo-7naxillary vein. The Temporal vein commences on the vertex of the head by a plexi- form network which is continuous with the frontal, the temporal, auricular, and occipital veins. The ramifications of this plexus form an anterior and a posterior branch which unite immediately above the zygoma ; the trunk is here joined by another large vein, the middle temporal, which collects the blood from the temporal muscle, and around the outer segment of the orbit, and pierces the temporal fascia near the root of the zygoma. The temporal vein then descends between the meatus auditorius extemus and the condyle of the lower jaw, and unites with the internal maxillary vein, to form the temporo-maxillary. The Temporo-maxillary vein formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillary, passes do^vnwards in the substance of the parotid gland to its lower border, where it becomes the external jugular vein. It receives in its course the anterior auricular, masse- teric, transverse facial, and parotid veins, and near its termination is joined by the posterior auricular vein. The Posterior auricular vein communicates with the plexus upon the vertex of the head, and descends behind the ear to the temporo- maxillary vein, immediately before that vessel merges in the external jugular. It receives in its course the veins from the external ear and the stylo-mastoid vein. The Occipital vein commencing posteriorly in the plexus of the vertex of the head, follows the direction of the occipital artery, and passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of the neck, terminates in the internal jugular vein. This vein communicates with the lateral nnus by means of a large branch which passes through the mastoid foramen, the mastoid vein. VEINS OF THE DIPLOE. The diploe of the bones of the head is furnished in the adult with ' rregular sinuses, which are formed by a continuation of the internal ■oat of the veins into the osseous canals in which they are lodged. At B B370 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. the middle period of life these sinuses are confined to the particular hones ; but in old age, after the ossification of the sutures, they may be traced from one bone to the next. They receive their blood from the capillaries supplying the cellular structure of the diploe, and terminate externally in the veins of the pericranium, and internally in the veins and sinuses of the dura mater. These veins are separated from the bony walls of the canals by a thin layer of medulla. CEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. j 1 The cerebral veins are remarkable for the absence of valves, and for the extreme tenuity of their coats. They may be arranged into the ; superficial, and deep or ventricular veins. i The Supei-ficial cerebral veins are situated on the surface of the ! hemispheres, lying in the grooves formed by the convexities of the | convolutions. They are named from the position which they may i chance to occupy upon the surface of this organ, either superior or in- \ ferior, internal or external, anterior or posterior. The Superior cerebral veins, seven or eight in number on each side, pass obliquely forwards, and terminate in the superior longitudinal sinus, in the opposite direction to the course of the stream of blood in the sinus. The Deep or Ventricular veins commence within the lateral ventricles by the veins of the corpora striata and those of the choroid plexus, | which unite to form the two venae Galeni. ! The Vena Galeni pass backwards in the structure of the velum in- t terpositum ; and escaping through the fissure of Bichat, terminate in j the straight sinus. t The Cerebellar veins are disposed, like those of the cerebrum, on the | surface of the lobes of the cerebellum; they are situated some upon the superior, and some upon the inferior surface, while others occupy the borders of the organ. They terminate in the lateral and petrosal ! sinuses. SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels, formed by the splitting of the layers of that membrane, and bned upon their inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They may be divided into two groups:—1. Those situated at the upper and back part of the skull. 2. The sinuses at the base of the skull. The former are, the Superior longitudinal sinus. Inferior longitudinal sinus. Straight sinus. Occipital sinuses. Lateral sinuses.SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS. 371 The Superior longitudinal sinus is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen csetum in the frontal, to the inner tuberosity of the occipital bone, where it divides into the two lateral sinuses. It is triangular in form, is small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives the superior cerebral veins which open into it obliquely, numerous small veins from the diploe, and near the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture the parietal mins, from the pericraniujn and scalp. Examined in its interior, it presents numerous transverse fibrous bands (trabeculae) the chordae Willisii, which are stretched across its inferior angle ; and some small white granular masses, the glandulae Pacchioni; the oblique openings of the cerebral veins, with their valve-like margin, are also seen on the walls of the sinus. The termination of the superior longitudinal sinus in the two lateral sinuses forms a considerable dilatation, into which the straight sinus opens from the front, and the occipital sinuses from below.

The Inferior longitudinal sinus is situated in the free margin of the falx cerebri ; it is cylindrical in form, and extends from near the crista galli to the anterior border of the tentorium, where it terminates in the straight sinus. It receives in its course several veins from the falx. The Straight or fourth sinus is the sinus of the tentorium ; it is situated at the line of union of the falx with the tentorium ; is pris- moid in form, and extends across the tentorium, from the termination of the inferior longitudinal sinus to the torcular Ilerophili. It receives the venae Galeni, the cerebral veins from the inferior part of the pos- terior lobes, and the superior cerebellar veins. The Occipital sinuses are two canals of small size, situated in the attached border of the falx cerebelli; they commence by several small veins around the foramen magnum, and terminate by separate open- ings in the torcular Herophili. They not unfrequently communicate with the termination of the lateral sinuses. The Lateral sinuses, commencing at the torcular Herophili, pass horizontally outwards, in the attached margin of the tentorium, and then curve downwards and inwards along the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at each side, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate in the internal jugular veins. Each sinus rests in its course on the transverse groove of the occipital bone, posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid portion of the temporal, and again on the occipital bone. They receive the cerebral veins from the inferior surface of the posterior lobes, the inferior cerebellar veins, the superior petrosal sinuses, the mastoid, and pos- terior condyloid veins, and at their termination, the inferior petrosal sinuses. These sinuses are often unequal in size, the right being larger than the left. The sinuses of the base of the skull are the— Cavernous, Inferior petrosal. Circular, Superior petrosal, Transverse. The Cavernous sinuses are named from presenting a structure similar, to that of the corpus cavemosum penis. They are situated on each side of the sella turcica, receiving, anteriorly, the ophthalmic veins through the sphenoidal fissures, and terminating posteriorly in the in- ferior petrosal sinuses. In the internal wall of each cavernous sinus is Torcular (a press), from a supposition entertained by the older anatomists that the columns of blood, coming in different directions, compressed each other at this point.INFERIOR PETROSAL SINUSES. 373 the internal carotid artery, accompanied by several filaments of the carotid plexus, and crossed by the sixth nerve; and, in its external wall, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic nerves. These structures are separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the tubular lining membrane. The cerebral veins from the under surface of the anterior lobes open into the cavernous sinuses. Thej’" communicate by means of the ophthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the cavernous sinuses backwards along the lower border of the petrous portion of the Fig. 135.* temporal bone at each side of the base of the skull, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the . commencement of the internal jugular veins. • The sinuses of the base of the skull. 1.

The posterior segment is larger than the anterior. The Superior petrosal sinuses pass obliquely backwards along the attached border of the tentorium, on the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and establish a communication between the cavernous and lateral sinus at each side. They receive one or two cerebral veins from the inferior part of the middle lobes, and a cere- bellar vein from the anterior border of the cerebellum. Near the e.K- tremity of the petrous bone these sinuses cross the oval aperture which transmits the fifth nerve. The Transverse sinus (basilar, anterior occipital) passes transversely across the basilar process of the occipital bone, forming a communica- tion between the two inferior petrosal sinuses. Sometimes there are two sinuses in this situation. VEINS OF THE NECK. The veins of the neck which return the blood from the head are the— External jugular. Anterior jugular. Internal jugular. Vertebral. The External jugular vein is formed by the union of the poste- I rior auricular vein with the temporo-maxillary, and commences at the lower border of the parotid gland, in front of the stemo-mastoid muscle. It descends the neck in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the lower jaw to the middle of the clavicle, crosses the stemo- mastoid, and terminates, near the posterior and inferior attachment of that muscle, in the subclavian vein. In its course downwards it lies upon the anterior lamella of the deep cervical fascia, which separates it from the sterno-mastoid muscle, and is covered in by the platysma myoides and superficial fascia. At the root of the neck it pierces the deep cervical fascia; it is accompanied, for the upper half of its course, by the auricularis magnus nerve. The branches which it receives are the occipital cutaneous and posterior cervical cutaneous, and, near its termination, the supra and posterior scapular. The external jugular vein is very variable in size, and is occasional!}' replaced by two veins. In the parotid gland it receives a large com- municating branch from the internal jugular vein. The Anterior jugular vein is a trunk of variable size, which col- lects the blood from the integmnent and superficial stractures on the fore part of the neck. It passes downwards along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and opens into the subclavian vein, near375 VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. the termination of the external jugular. The two veins communicate with each other, and with the external and internal jugular vein. The Internal juyidar vein, formed by the convergence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinus, commences at the foramen lacerum poste- rius on each side of the base of the skull, and descends the side of the neck, lying, in the first instance, to the outer side of the internal carotid, and then upon the outer side of the common carotid artery to the root of the neck, where it unites with the subclavian, and consti- tutes the vena innominata. At its commencement, the internal jugu- lar vein is posterior and external to the internal carotid arter}'-, and the eighth and ninth pairs of nerves; lower down, the vein and artery are on the same plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves passing forwards between them, the pneumogastric being between and behind in the same sheath, and the nervus accessorius crossing ob- liquely behind the vein. The Branches which the internal jugular receives in its coiu’se are, the facial, the lingtial, the inferior pharyngeal, the occipital, and the superior and inferior thyroid veins. The Vertebral vein descends by the side of the vertebral artery in the canal formed by the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and terminates at the root of the neck in the com- mencement of the vena innominata. In the lower part of the vertebral canal it frequently divides into two branches, one of which advances forwards, while the other passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, before opening into the vena innominata. The Branches which it receives in its course are the posterior condy- loid vein, muscular branches, the cervical meningo-rachidian veins, and near its termination, the superficial and deep cervical veins. The Inferior thyroid veins, two, and frequently more in number, are situated one on each side of the trachea, and receive the venous blood from the thyroid gland. They communicate with each other, and with the superior thyroid veins, and form a plexus upon the front of the trachea. The right vein terminates in the right vena innominata, just at its union with the superior cava, and the left in the left vena innominata. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The veins of the upper extremity are the deep and superficial. The deep veins accompany the branches and trunks of the arteries, and constitute their vence comites. The venae comites of the radial and ulnar arteries are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and terminate at the bend of the elbow in the brachial veins. The brachial venae comites are situated one on each side of the artery, and open into the axillaiy vein ; the axillary becomes the subclavian, and the subclavian unites with the internal jugular to form the vena inno- minata.376 CEPHALIC VEIN. The Superficial veins of the fore-arm are the— ' Fig 136.* Anterior ulnar vein, Posterior ulnar vein, Basilic vein, Radial vein, Cephalic vein. Median vein. Median basilic. Median cephalic. The yifilerior ulnar vein collects the venous blood from the inner border of the hand, and from the vein of the little-finger, vena salva- tella, and ascends the inner side of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, where it becomes the basilic vein. The Posterior ulnar vein, irregu- lar in size, and frequently absent, commences upon the inner border and posterior aspect of the hand, and ascending the fore-arm, termi- nates in front of the inner condj'le, in the anterior ulnar vein. ThePasilic vei?i ((IcunXixos, royal, or principal) ascends from the com- mon ulnar vein formed by the two preceding, along the inner side of the upper arm, and near its middle pierces the fascia ; it then passes upwards to the axilla, and becomes the axillary vein. The Radial vein commences in the large vein of the thumb, on the outer and posterior aspect of the hand, and ascends along the outer border of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, where it becomes the cephalic vein.

A large communicating branch sometimes crosses the clavicle between the external jugular and this vein, which gives it the appearance of being derived directly from the head—hence its appellation. The Median vein is intermediate in position between the anterior ulnar and radial vein ; it collects the blood from the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, communicating with the two preceding. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch from the deep veins, and divides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic. The Median cephalic vein, generally the smaller of the two, passes obliquely outwards, in the groove between the biceps and supinator longus, to join the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cuta- neous nerve pass behind it. The Median basilic vein passes obliquely inwards, in the groove between the biceps and pronator radii teres, and terminates in the basilic vein. This vein is crossed by one or two filaments of the in- ternal cutaneous nerve, and is separated from the brachial artery by the aponeurotic slip given off by the tendon of the biceps. AXILLARY VEIN. The axillary vein is formed by the union of the veme comites of the brachial artery with the basilic vein. It lies in front of the arterj', receives numerous branches from the collateral veins of the branches of the axillary artery; and at the lower border of the first rib becomes the subclavian vein. SUBCLAVIAN VEIN. The subclavian vein crosses over the first rib and beneath the clavicle, and unites with the internal jugidar vein to form the vena innominata. It lies at first in front of the subclavian artery, and then in front of the scalenus anticus, which separates it from that vessel. The phrenic and pneumogastric nerves pass between the artery and vein. The veins opening into the subclavian are the cephalic below the clavicle, and the external and anterior jugulars above; occasionally ! some small veins from the neighbouring parts also terminate in it. VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The veins of the lower extremity are the deep and superficial. The ■ deep veins accompany the branches of the arteries in pairs, and fonn : the venm comites of the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal r, arteries. These veins unite in the popliteal region to form a single ' vein of large size, the popliteal, which successively becomes in its course the femoral and the external iliac vein.370 POPLITEAL VEIN. The popliteal vein ascends through the popliteal region, lying, in the first instance directly upon the artery, and then getting somewhat to its outer side. It receives several muscular and articular branches, and the external saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. FEMORAL VEIN. The femoral vein, passing through the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, ascends the thigh in the sheath of the femoral artery, and entering the pelvis beneath Poupart’s ligament, becomes the ex- ternal iliac vein. In the lower part of its course it is situated upon the outer side of the artery ; it then becomes placed behind that ves- sel, and, at Poupart’s ligament, lies to its inner side. It receives the muscular veins, and the profunda, and, through the saphenous open- ing, the internal saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. . i The Profunda vein is formed by the convergence of the numerous < small veins which accompany the branches of the artery ; it is a vein i of large size, lying in front of the profunda artery, and it terminates I in the femoral at about an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament. ] Superficial veins are the external or short, and the internal or long saphenous. The External saphenous vein collects the blood from the outer side of the foot and leg. It passes behind the outer ankle, ascends along the posterior aspect of the legi lying in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle, and pierces the deep fascia in the popliteal region to join the popliteal vein. It receives several cuta- neous branches in the popliteal region before passing through the deep fascia, and is accompanied in its course by the external saphenous nerve. The Internal saphenous vein commences upon the dorsum and inner side of the foot. It ascends in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the leg ; it then passes behind the inner condyle of the femur and along the inner side of the thigh to the saphenous open- ing, where it pierces the sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminates in the femoral vein, at about one inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament. It receives in its course the cutaneous veins of the leg and thigh, and communicates freely with the deep veins. At the saphenous opening it is joined by the superficial epigastric and circuraflexa ilii veins, and by the external pudic. The situation of this vein in the thigh is not imfrequently occupied by two or even three trunks of nearly equal size.VEINS OF THE TRUNK. The veins of the trunk may be divided into 1. The superior vena cava, with its formative branches. 2. The inferior vena cava, with its formative branches. 3. The azygos veins. 4. The vertebral and spinal veins. 5. The cardiac veins. 6. The portal vein. 7. The pulmonary veins. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FOR.MATIVE BRANCHES. V&icB Innominatce. The VencB innominatcB are two large trunks, formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian vein, at each side of the root of the neck. The Right vena innominata, about an inch and a quarter in length, lies superficially and externally to the arteria innominata, and descends iilmost vertically to unite with its fellow of the opposite side in the formation of the superior cava. At the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins it receives from behind the ductus lymphaticus dexter, and lower do\vn it has opening into it the right vertebral, right internal mammary and right inferior thyroid vein. The Left vena innominata, considerably longer than the right, ex- tends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, to the right side of the mediasti- num, where it imites with the right vena innominata, to constitute the superior cava. It is in relation in front with the left stemo-clavicular articulation and the first piece of the sternum. At its commencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left vertebral, left infeiior thyroid, left mammary, and by the superior intercostal vein. It also receives some small veins from the mediastinum and thymus gland. There are no valves in the venm innominatae. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The superior cava is a short trunk about three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two venae innominatae. It descends perpendicularly on the right side of the mediastinum, and entering the pericardium terminates in the upper part of the right auricle. It is in relation in front with the thoracic fascia, which separates it from the thymus gland, and wth the pericardium; behind with the right pulmonary artery, and right superior pulmonary vein; internally - with the ascending aorta; eodemally with the right phrenic nerve, and r right lung. Immediately before entering the pericardium it receives • the vena azygos major.380 INFERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. * The veins of the trunk and neck. 1. The superior vena cava. 2.

The External iliac vein lies to the inner side of the correspond- ing artery at the os pubis; but gradually gets behind it as it passes upwards along the brim of the pelvis, and it terminates opposite the sacro-iliac sym- physis by uniting with the in- ternal iliac, to form the common iliac vein. Immediately above Poupart’s ligament it receives the epigastric and circumflexa ilii veins; it has no valves. The Internal iliac vein is formed by vessels Avhich cor- respond with the branches of the internal iliac artery; it re- ceives the returning blood from the gluteal, ischiatic, internal pudic, and obturator veins, ex- ternally to the pelvis ; and from the vesical and uterine plexuses within the pelvis. The vein lies to the inner side of the in- ternal iliac artery, and termi- nates by uniting with the ex- ternal iliac vein, to form the common iliac. The Vesical and prostatic plexus is an important plexus of veins which surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland, and receives its blood from the great dorsal vein of the penis, and from the veins of the external organs of generation. It is retained in connection Muth the sides of the bladder by a reflexion of the pelvic fascia.INFERIOR VENA CAVA. 381 The Uterine plexus is situated around the vagina, and upon the sides of the uterus, between the two layers of the broad ligaments. The veins fonning the vesical and uterine plexus are peculiarly subject to the production of phlebolites. The Common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac vein on each side of the pelvis. The riffht common iliac, shorter than the left, ascends obliquely behind the correspond- ing artery; and upon the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, unites with the vein of the opposite side, to form the inferior cava. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique than the right, ascends behind, and a little internally to the corresponding arteiy, and passes beneath the right common iliac artery, near its origin, to unite with the right vein in the formation of the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac vein has no branch open- inn into it; the left receives the vena sacra media. These veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA. The inferior vena cava is formed by the union of the two common iliac veins, upon the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. It ascends along the front of the vertebral column, on the right side of the abdominal aorta, and passing through the fissure in the posterior border of the liver and the quadrilateral opening in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, terminates in the inferior and posterior part of the right auricle. There are no valves in this vein. It is in relation from below upwards, in front with the mesentery transverse duodenum, portal vein, pancreas, and liver, which latter nearly and sometimes completely surrounds it; behind it rests on the vertebral column and right crus of the diaphragm, from which it is se- parated by the right renal and right lumbar arteries ; to the right it has the peritoneum and sympathetic nerve ; and to the left the aorta. The Branches which the inferior cava receives in its course, are the— Lumbar, Right spermatic. Renal, Supra-renal, Phrenic, Hepatic. ternal iliac vein. 11. The common iliac veins; the small vein between these is the vena sacra media. 12, 12. Lumbar veins. 13. The right spermatic vein. 14. The left spermatic, opening into the left renal vein. 15.

The superior intercostal vein; communicating inferiorly with the lesser vena azygos, and terminating superiorly in the left vena innominata.382 AZYGOS VEINS Tlie Lumbar veins, three or four in number on each side, collect the venous blood from the muscles and integument of the loins, and from the spinal veins : the left are longer than the right on account of the position of the vena cava. The Right spermatic vein is formed by the two veins which return the blood from the venous plexus situated in the spermatic cord. These veins follow the course of the spermatic artery, and unite to form the single trunk which opens' into the inferior vena cava. The left spermatic vein terminates in the left renal vein. The Ovarian veins represent the spermatic veins of the male, and collect the venous blood from the ovaries, round ligaments, and Fallo- pian tubes, and communicate with the uterine sinuses. They termi- nate as in the male. The Renal or emulgent vems return the blood from the kidneys ; their branches are situated in front of the divisions of the renal arte- ries, and the left opens into the vena cava somewhat higher than the right. The left is longer than the right in consequence of the position of the vena cava, and crosses the aorta immediately below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It receives the left spermatic vein, Avhich terminates in it at right angles ; hence the more frequent occur- rence of varicocele on the left than on the right side. The Supra-renal veins terminate partly in the renal veins, and parti}* in the inferior vena cava. The Phrenic veins return the blood from the ramifications of the phrenic arteries ; they open into the inferior cava. The Hepatic veins form two principal trunks and numerous smaller veins which open into the inferior cava, while that vessel is situated in the posterior border of the liver. The hepatic veins commence in the liver by minute venules, the intralobular veins, in the centre of each lobule ; these pour their blood into larger vessels, the sublobular veins; and the sublobular veins constitute, by their convergence and union, the hepatic trunks, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. AZYGOS VEINS. The azygos veins (fig. 137) form a system of communication be- tween the superior and inferior vena cava, and serve to return the blood from that part of the trunk of the body in which those vessels are deficient, on account of their connection with the heart. This system consists of three vessels, the Vena azygos major, Vena azygos minor, Superior intercostal vein. The Vena azygos major commences in the lumbar region by a com- munication with the lumbar veins ; sometimes it is joined by a branch directly from the inferior vena cava, or by one from the renal vein.383 VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. It passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, and ascends along the right side of the vertebral column to the third dorsal verte- bra, where it arches forwards over the right bronchus, and terminates in the superior cava. It receives all the intercostal veins of the right side, the vena azygos minor, and the bronchial veins. The Vena azygos minor commences in the lumbar region, on the left side, by a communication with the lumbar or renal veins. It passes beneath the border of the diaphragm, and, ascending along the left side of the vertebral column, crosses the fifth or sixth dorsal ver- tebra to open into the vena azygos major. It receives the six or seven lower intercostal veins of the left side. The azygos veins have no valves. The Superior intercostal vein is the trunk formed by the union of the five or six upper intercostal veins of the left side. It communicates below with the vena azygos minor, and ascends to terminate in the left vena innominata. VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. The numerous venous plexuses of the vertebral column and spinal cord may be arranged into three groups;— Dorsi-spinal, Meningo-rachidian, Medulli-spinal. The Dorsi-spinal veins form a plexus around the spinous, transverse and articular processes, and arches of the vertebrae. They receive the returning blood from the dorsal muscles and surrounding structures, and transmit it, in part to the meningo-rachidian, and in part to the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral veins. The Meningo-rachidian veins are situated between the theca verte- bralis and the vertebrae. They communicate freely with each other by means of a complicated plexus. In front they form two longitudi- nal trunks, {longitiidinal spinal sinuses,) which extend the whole length of the column on each side of the posterior common ligament, and are joined on the body of each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large basi-vertebral veins from the interior of each vertebra. The meningo-rachidian veins commu- nicate superiorly through the anterior condyloid foramina with the in- ternal jugulars; in the neck they pour their blood into the vertebral veins; in the thorax, into the intercostals; and in the loins and pelvis into the lumbar and sacral veins, the communications being established ithrough the intervertebral foramina. The Medulli-spinal veins are situated between the pia mater and ; arachnoid ; they communicate freely with each other to form plexuses, land they send branches through the intervertebra Iforamina with each 'of the spinal nerves, to join the veins of the trunk.384 PORTAL SYSTEM. CARDIAC VEINS. Tlie veins returning the blood from the substance of the heart, are the— Great cardiac Vein, Posterior cardiac veins, Anterior cardiac veins. Venae Thebesii. The Great cardiac vein (coronary) commences at the apex of the lieart, and ascends along the anterior ventricular groove to the base of the ventricles ; it then curves around the left auriculo-ventricular groove to the posterior part of the heart, where it terminates in the right auricle. It receives in its course the left cardiac veins from the left auricle and ventricle, and the posterior cardiac veins from the pos- terior ventricular groove. The Posterior cardiac vein, frequently two in number, commences also at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the posterior ventri- cular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein. It receives the veins from the posterior aspect of the two ventricles. The Anterior cardiac veins collect the blood from the anterior sur- face of the right ventricle; one larger than the rest runs along the right border of the heart and joins the trunk formed by these veins, which curves around the right auriculo-ventricular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein near its entrance into the right auricle. The VencB Thehesii are numerous minute venules which convey the venous blood directly from the substance of the heart into its four cavities. Their existence is denied by some anatomists. PORTAL SYSTEM. The portal system is composed of four large veins which return the blood from the chylopoietic viscera; they are the— Inferior mesenteric vein, Superior mesenteric vein. Splenic vein. Gastric veins. The Inferior mesenteric vein receives its blood from the rectum by means of the hremorrhoidal veins, and from the sigmoid flexure and descending colon, and ascends behind the transverse duodenum and pancreas, to terminate in the splenic vein. Its haemorrhoidal branches inosculate with branches of the internal iliac vein, and thus establish a communication between the portal and general venous system. The Superior mesenteric vein is formed by branches which collectSPLENIC VEIN. 385 the venous blood from the capillaries of the superior mesenteric artery; they constitute by their junction a large trunk, which ascends by the side of the corresponding artery, crosses the transverse duodenum, and unites behind the pancreas with the splenic in the formation of the portal vein.

It passes horizontally inwards behind the pancreas, and terminates near its greater end by uniting with the superior mesenteric and forming the portal vein. It receives in its course the gastric and pancreatic veins, and near its termination the inferior mesenteric vein. The Gastric veins correspond with the gastric, gastro-epiploic, and vasa brevia arteries, and terminate in the splenic vein. The Vena port.®, formed by the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric vein behind the pancreas, ascends through the right border of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, one for each lateral lobe- In the right border of the lesser omentum it is situated behind and between the hepatic artery and ductus communis choledochus, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and lymphatics. At the transverse fissure each primary branch divides into numerous secondary branches which ramify through the portal canals, and give oif vaginal and inter- lobular veins, and the latter terminate in the lobular venous plexus of the lobules of the liver. The portal vein within the liver receives the venous blood from the capillaries of the hepatic arterj^ PULMONARY VEINS. The pulmonary veins, four in number, return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart; they differ from the veins in general, in the area of their cylinders being very little larger than that of the corresponding arteries, and in accompanying singly each branch of the pulmonary artery. They commence in the capillaries upon the parietes of the intercellular passages and air-cells, and unite to form a single trunk for each lobe. The vein of the middle lobe of the right lung unites with the superior vein so as to form the two trunks which open into the left auricle. Sometimes they remain separate, and then there are three pulmonary veins on the right side. The right pul- monary veins pass behind the superior vena cava to the left auricle, and the left behind the pulmonary artery; they both pierce the peri- cardium. Within the lung the branches of the pulmonary veins are behind the bronchial tubes, and those of the pulmonary artery in front; but at the root of the lungs the veins are in front, next the arteries, and then the bronchi. There are no valves in the pulmonarj' veins.387 CHAPTER VII. ON THE LYMPHATICS. The lymphatic vessels, or absorbents, have received their double appellation from certain phenomena which they present; the former name being derivable from the appearance of the limpid fluid (lympha, water) which they convey; and the latter from their supposed pro- perty of absorbing foreign substances into the system. They are minute, delicate, and transparent vessels, remarkable for their general uniformity of size, for a knotted appearance which is due to the i presence of, numerous valves, for the frequent dichotomous divisions which occur in their course, and for their division into several branches immediately before entering a gland. Their oflice is to collect the I; products of digestion and the detrita of nutrition, and convey them 11 into the venous circulation near the heart. I Lymphatic vessels commence in a delicate network which is distri- mted on the cutaneous surface of the body, on the various surfaces of )rgans and throughout their internal structure ; and from this net- work the lymphatic vessels proceed, nearly in straight lines, in a Erection towards the root of the neck. In their course they are in- ;ercepted by numerous, small, spheroid or oblong or flattened bodies, ymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels entering these glands are ermed vasa inferentia or afferentia, and those which quit them, vasa fferentia. The vasa inferentia vary in number from two to six, they livide at the distance of a few lines from the gland into several smaller ressels, and enter it by one of the flattened surfaces.* The vasa efie- •entia escape from the gland on the opposite, but not unfrequently on he same surface ; they consist, like the vasa inferentia at their junc- ion with the gland, of several small vessels which unite after a course 'f a few lines to form from one to three trunks, often twice as large as he vasa inferentia. Lymphatic vessels admit of a threefold division, into superficial, ! leep, and lactcals. The superficial lymphatic vessels, on the surface ■>f the body, follow the course of the veins, and pierce the deep fascia rn convenient situations, to join the deep lymphatics. On the sur- face of organs they converge to the nearest lymphatic trunks. The ‘Upetficial lymphatic glands are placed in the most protected situations * See Mr. Lane’s article on the “ Lymphatic System,” in the Cyclopaedia of ► vnatomy and Physiology. <380 GENERAI> ANATOMY OF LYMPHATICS. of the superficial fascia, as in tlie hollow of the ham and groin in the lower extremity, and on the inner side of the arm in the upper extre- mity. The deep lymphaUcs, fewer in number and somewhat larger than the superficial vessels, accompany the deeper veins ; those from the lower parts of the body converging to the numerous glands seated around the iliac veins and inferior vena cava, and terminating in a large trunk situated on the vertebral column, the thoracic duct. From the upper part of the trunk of the body on the left side, and from the left side of the head and neck, they also proceed to the thoracic duct. Those on the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, and right side of the thorax, form a distinct duct which terminates at the point of junction of the subclavian with the internal jugular vein on the right side of the root of the neck. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestines ; thej' have received their distinctive appellation from conveying the milk- like product of digestion, the chyle, to the great centre of the l)mpha- tic s}'-stem, the thoracic duct. They are situated in the mesenterj’-, and pass through the numerous mesenteric glands in their course. Lymphatic vessels are very generally distributed through the ani- mal tissues ; there are, nevertheless, certain structures in which they have never been detected; for example, the brain and spinal cord, the eye, bones, cartilages, tendons, the membranes of the ovum, the um- bilical cord, and the placenta. The anastomoses between these vessels are less frequent than between arteries and veins; they are effected by means of vessels of equal size with the vessels which they connect, and no increase of calibre results from their junction. The Ijmphatic vessels are smallest in the neck, larger in the upper extremities, and larger still in the lower limbs. For the purpose of effecting the movement of their fluids in a pro- per direction, lymphatic vessels are furnished with valves, and it is to these that the appearance of constrictions around the cylinders of the vessels, at short distances, is due. Like the valves of veins, the valves of lymphatic vessels are each composed of two semilunar flaps attached bj’- their convex border to the sides of the vessel and free by their concave border. This is the general character of the valves, but, as in veins, there are exceptions in their form and disposition ; sometimes one flap is so small as to be merely rudimentarj', while the other is large in proportion ; sometimes the flap runs all the way round the tube, leaving a central aperture which can only be closed b)^ a contrac- tile power in the valve itself ; and sometimes instead of being circular, the aperture is elliptical, and the arrangement of the flaps like that of the ileo-coecal valve.* These peculiarities are most frequently met with at and near the anastomoses of the lymphatic vessels. The valves occur most numerously near the lymphatic glands; next in frequency they are found in the neck and upper extremities where Mr. Lane, loc. cit.LYMPHATICS OF THE HE,\D AND NECK. 38f) the vessels are small, and least numerously in the lower limbs where the lymphatics are larger. In the thoracic duct an interspace of two or three inches frequently occurs between the valves. Connected with the presence of valves in the lymphatic vessels, are two lateral dilatations or pouches, analogous to the valvular sinuses of veins. These sinuses are situated on the cardiac side of the valves; they re- ceive the valves when the latter are thrown back by the current of the lymph; and when reflux occurs, they become distended with a body of fluid which makes pressure on the flaps. These pouch-like dilatations and the constrictions corresponding with the line of attachment of the convex borders of the flaps are the cause of the knotted appearance of distended Ijrmphatic vessels. Like arteries and veins, Ijunphatic vessels are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external coat is areolo- fibrous, like that of blood-vessels; it is thin, but very strong, and serves to connect the vessel to surrounding tissues, at the same time that it forms a protective covering. The middle coat is thin and elastic, and consists of a layer of longitudinal fibres analogous to those of the innermost layer of the middle coat of arteries and veins. Some few circiflar fibres may be seen externally to these in the larger lym- phatic vessels. The internal coat is inelastic and more liable to rup- ture than the other coats. It is a serous layer continuous with the lining membrane of the veins, and invested by an epithelium. The valves are composed of a very thin layer of fibrous tissue coated on its two surfaces by epithelium. The Ivrmphatic glands (conglobate, absorbent) are small oval and somewhat flattened or rounded bodies, composed of a plexus of minute lymphatic vessels, associated with a plexus of blood-vessels, and en- closed in a thin capsule of areolar tissue. When examined on the surface they are seen to have a lobulated appearance, while the face of a section is cellular from the division of the numberless convolutions which are formed by the lymphatic vessels within its substance. The . colour of the glands is a pale pink, excepting those of the lungs, the i bronchial glands, which in the adult are more or less mottled with black, • and are sometimes filled with a black pigment. Lymphatic glands are I larger in the young subject than in the adult, and are smallest in old I'.age ; they, as well as their vessels, are supplied with arteries, veins and I nerves, like other structures. I shall describe the lymphatic vessels and glands according to the rarrangement adopted for the veins, commencing with those of the ^.head and neck, and proceeding next to those of the upper extremity, . lower extremity, and trunk. LYMPHATICS OF THF. HEAD AND NECK. The Superjicial lymphatic glands of the head and face are small, few :.n munber, and isolated; they are, the occipital, which are situated390 LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. near tlie origin of the occipito-frontalis muscle; posterior aurkvlar^ behind the ear ; parotid^ in the parotid gland; zyyomatic, in the zy- gomatic fossa ; buccal, upon the buccinator muscle ; and sttLmaxiUury, beneath the margin of the lower jaw. There are no deep Ijunphatic glands within the cranium. The Superficial cervical lymphatic glands are few in number and small; they are situated in the course of the external jugular vein, be- tween the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles, at the root of the neck, and about the larynx. The Deep cervical glands (glandulie concatenate) are numerous and of large size ; they are situated around the internal jugular vein and sheath of the carotid arteries, by the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extend from the base of the skull to the root of the neck, where they are in communication with the lymphatic vessels and glands of the thorax. The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the head ami face are disposed in three groups ; occipital, which take the course of the occipital vein to the occipital and deep cervical glands ; temporal, which follow the branches of the temporal vein to the parotid and deep cervical glands; and facial, which accompany the facial vein to the submaxillary lym- phatic glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the head are the meningeal and cere- hrcd; the former are situated in connection with the meningeal veins, and escape through foramina at the base of the skull, to join the deep , cervical glands. The cerebrcd lymphatics, according to Fohmann, are \ situated on the surface of the pia mater, none having as yet been dis- covered in the substance of the brain. They pass most probably through the foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the face proceed from the nasal fossae, mouth, and pharynx, and terminate in the submaxillary and deep cervical glands. The Superficial and deep cervical lymphatic vessels accompany the jugrdar veins, passing from gland to gland, and at the root of the neck communicate with the thoracic lymphatic vessels, and terminate, on the right side, in the ductus Ijmphaticus dexter, and, on the left, in the thoracic duct, near its termination. LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The Superficial lymphatic glands of the arm are not more than four or five in number, and of very small size. One or two are situated near the median basilic and cephalic veins, at the bend of the elbow ; and one or two near the basilic vein, on the inner side of the upper arm, immediately above the elbow. The Deep glands in the fore-arm are excessivel}^ small and infre- quent ; two or three may generally be found in the course of theLYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 391 radial and idnar vessels. In the upper arm there is a chain of small glands, accompanying the brachial artery. The Axillary glands are numerous and of large size. Some are closely adherent to the vessels, others are dispersed in the loose areolar tissue of the axilla, and a small chain may be observed extending along the lower border of the pectoralis major to the mammarj’- gland. Two or three subclavian glands are situated beneath the clavicle, and serve as the medium of commimication between the axillary and deep cervical lymphatic glands. The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity commence upon the fingers and take their course along the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow. The greater part reach their destination by passing along the dorsal surface of the fingers, wrist, and fore-arm, and then curving aroimd the borders of the latter ; but some few are met with in the palm of the hand, which take the direction of the median vein. At the bend of the elbow the lymphatics arrange themselves into two groups ; an internal and larger group, which communicates with a gland situated just above the inner condyle, and then accompanies the basilic vein upwards to the axilla to enter the axillary glands ; and a small group which follows the course of the cephalic vein. Several of the vessels of this group cross the biceps muscle at its upper part to enter the axillary glands, while the remainder, two or three in number, ascend with the cephalic vein in the interspace of the deltoid and pec- toralis major ; these latter usually join a small gland in this space, and then cross the pectoralis minor muscle to become continuous with the subclanan lymphatics. Besides the lymphatic vessels of the arm, the axillary glands receive those from the integument of the chest, its anterior, posterior, and Lateral aspect, and the lymphatics of the mammary gland. The Deep lymphatics accompany the vessels of the upper extremity, and communicate occasionally with the superficial lymphatics. They enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and, at the root of the neck, terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The Superficial lymphatic glands of the lower extremity are those of the groin, the inguinal ; and one or two situated in the superficial fascia of the posterior aspect of the thigh, just above the popliteal region. The Inguinal glands are divisible into two groups; a superior group of small size, situated along the course of Poupart’s ligament, and re- ceiving the lymphatic vessels from the parietes of the abdomen, gluteal region, perineum, and genital organs ; and an inferior group of larger glands clustered around the internal saphenous vein near its392 LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. termination, and receiving tlie superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The Deep lymphatic glands are the anterior tiliial, jtoplitml, deep in- guinal, gluteal, and iscliiatic. The A nterior tihial is generally a single gland, placed on the inter- osseous membrane, by the side of the anterior tibial artery in the upper part of its course. The Popliteal glands, four or five in number and small, are embedded in the loose areolar tissue and fat of the popliteal space. The Deep inguinal glands, less numerous and smaller than the super- ficial, are situated near the femoral vessels in the groin, beneath the fascia lata. The Gluteal and isehiatic glands are placed near the vessels of that name, above and below the pyriformis muscle at the great isehiatic foramen. The Superficial lymphatic vessels are divisible into two groups, in- ternal and external; the internal and principal group, commencing on the dorsum and inner side of the foot, ascend the leg by the side of the internal saphenous vein, and passing behind the inner condyle of the femur, follow the direction of that vein to the groin, where they join the saphenous group of superficial inguinal glands. The greater part of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening and the sheath of the femoral vessels, to join the lymphatic gland situated in the femoral ring, which serves to establish a communication between the lymiphatics of the lower extremity and those of the trunk. The other efferent vessels pierce the fascia lata to join the deep glands. The vessels which pass up- wards from the outer side of the dorsum of the foot, ascend along the outer side of the leg, and curve inwards just below the knee, to unite with the lymphatics of the inner side of the thigh.' The eodemal group consists of a few lymphatic vessels which commence on the outer side of the foot and posterior part of the ankle, and accompany' the external saphenous vein to the popliteal region, where they enter the popliteal glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels accompany the deep veins, and com- municate with the various glands in their course. After joining the deep inguinal glands they pass beneath Poupart’s ligament, to com- municate with the numerous glands situated aroimd the iliac vessels. The deep lymphatics of the gluteal region follow the course of the branches of the gluteal and isehiatic arteries. The former join the glands situated on the upper border of the py'riformis muscle, and the latter, after communicating with the lymphatics of the thigh, enter the isehiatic glands. LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. The lymphatics of the trunk may be arranged under three heads, superrficial, deep, and visceral.LY.MFHATICS Of THE TRUNK. 393 The Superjicial lymphatic wssels of the upper half of the trunk pass upwards and outwards on each side, and converge, some to the axillary glands, and others to the glands at the root of the neck. The lym- phatics from the mammary glands follow the lower border of the pec- toralis major, communicating, by means of a chain of lymphatic glands, with the axillary glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the lower half of the trunk, of the gluteal region, perineum, and external organs of generation, converge to the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. Some small glands are situated on each side of the dorsal vein of the penis, near the suspensory ligament; from these, as from the superficial lymphatics, the efferent vessels pass into the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. The Detp lymphatic glands of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammar}', anterior mediastinal, and posterior mediastinal. The'Intercostal glands are of small size, and are situated on each side of the vertebral column, near the articulations of the heads of the ribs, and in the course of the intercostal arteries. The Internal mammary glands also very small, are placed in the intercostal spaces, by the side of the internal mammary arteries. The Anterior mediastinal glands occupy the loose areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, resting some on the diaphragm^ but the greater number on the large vessels at the root of the heart. The Posterior mediastinal glands are situated along the course of the aorta and oesophagus in the posterior mediastinum, and communicate above wth the deep cervical glands, on each side with the intercostal and below with the abdominal glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammarj', and diaphragmatic. The Intercostal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the arteries of the same name ; and reaching the vertebral column curve downwards, to terminate in the thoracic duct. The Internal mammary lymphatics commence in the parietes of the abdomen, communicating with the epigastric lymphatics. They as- cend by the side of the internal mammary vessels, being joined in their course by the anterior intercostals, and terminate at the root of the neck, on the right side in the tributaries of the ductus lymphaticus dexter, and on the left in the thoracic duct. The diaphragmatic lym- phatics pursue the direction of their corresponding veins, and tenninate some in front in the internal mammary vessels, and some behind, in the posterior mediastinal Ijnnphatics. The Deep lymphatic glands of the abdomen are the lumbar glands ; they are very numerous, and are seated aroimd the common iliac ves- sels, the aorta and vena cava. The deep lymphatic glands of the pelvis are the external iliac, inter- nal iliac and sacral. The Eatemal iliac are placed around the external iliac vessels, being in continuation by one extremity with the femoral lymphatics, and by the other with the lumbar glands.394 LVMPirATICS OF THE VISCERA. The Internal iliac glands are situated in tlie course of the internal iliac vessels, and the sacral glands are supported by the concave sur- face of the sacrum. The Deep lymphatic vessels are continued upwards from the thigh, beneath Poupart’s ligament, and along the external iliac vessels to the lumbar glands, receiving in their course the epigastric, circumflexa ilii, and ilio-lumbar lymphatic vessels. Those from the parietes of the pelvis, and from the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac arteries, and unite with the lumbar Ijun- phatics. And the lumbar lymphatic vessels, after receiving all the lymphatics from the lower extremities, pelvis, and loins, tenninate by several large trunks in the receptaculum chyli. LVMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. The Lymphatic vessels of the lungs are of large size, and are distri- buted over every part of the surface, and through the texture of these organs ; they converge to the numerous glands situated around the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs, the bronchial glands. Some of these glands of small size, may be traced in connection with the bronchial tubes for some distance into the lungs. The efferent vessels from the bronchial glands unite with the tracheal and oesopha- geal glands, and terminate principally in the thoracic duct at the root of the neck, and partly in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. The bron- chial glands, in the adult, present a variable tint of brown, and in old age a deep black colour. In infancj”^ they have none of this pigment, and are not to be distinguished from 13'mphatic glands in other situa- tions. The Lymphatic vessels of the heart originate in the subserous areolar tissue of the surface, and in the deeper tissues of the organ, and follow the course of the vessels, principally, along the right border of the heart to the glands situated around the arch of the aorta and to the bron- chial glands, whence they proceed to the root of the neck, and termi- nate in the thoracic duct. The Pericardiac and thymic lymphatic vessels proceed to join the anterior mediastinal and bronchial glands. The Lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into the deep and superficial. The former take their course through the portal canals, and through the right border of the lesser omentum, to the lymphatic glands situated in the course of the hepatic artery and along the lesser curve of the stomach. The superficial lymphatics are situated in the areolar structure of the proper capsule, over the whole surface of the liver. Those of the convex surface are divided into two sets;— 1. Those which pass from before backwards; 2. Those which advance from behind forwards. The former unite to form trunks, which enter between the folds of the lateral ligaments at the right395 LACTEALS. and left extremities of the organ, and of the coronary ligament in the middle. Some of these pierce the diaphragm and join the posterior mediastinal glands ; others converge to the lymphatic glands situated around the inferior cava. Those which pass from behind forwards consist of two groups; one ascends between the folds of the broad ligament, and perforates the diaphragm, to terminate in the anterior mediastinal glands ; the other curves around the anterior margin of the liver to its concave smface, and from thence to the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum. The lymphatic vessels of the concave smface are variously distributed, according to their position ; those from the right lobe terminate in the lumbar glands ; those from the gall-bladder, which are large and form a remai-kable plexus, enter the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum ; and those from the left lobe converge to the lymphatic glands situated along the lesser cimve of the stomach. The Lymphatic glands of the spleen are situated around its hilus, and those of the pancreas in the course of the splenic vein. The lymphatic vessels of these organs pass through their respective glands, and join the aortic glands, previously to terminating in the thoracic duct. The Lymphatic glands of the stomach sxe of small size, and are situated along the lesser and greater curves of that organ. The lymphatic vessels, as in other viscera, are superficial and deep, the fonner originating in the subserous and the latter in the submucous tissue ; they pass from the stomach in four different directions: some ascend to the glands, situated along the lesser curve, others descend to those occupying the greater curve, a third set pass outwards to the splenic glands, and a fourth to the glands situated near the pylorus and to the aortic glands. The Lymphatic glands of the small intestine are situated between the layers of the mesentery, in the meshes formed by the superior mesen- teric arterj^, and are thence named mesenteric glands. These glands are most munerous and largest, superiorly, near the duodenum ; and, in- feriorly, near the termination of the ileum. The Lymphatic vessels of the small intestines are of two kinds: those of the structure of the intestines, which run upon its siu-face previ- ously to entering the mesenteric glands ; and those which commence in the villi, in the substance of the mucous membrane, and are named lac teals. The Lacteals, according to Henle, commence in the centre of each villus as a csecal tubulus, which opens into a fine network, situated in the sub-mucous tissue. From this areolar network the lacteal vessels proceed to the mesenteric glands, and from thence to the thoracic duct, in which they terminate. The Lymphatic glands of the large intestines axe situated along the attached margin of the intestine, in the meshes formed by the colic and hcEmorrhoidal arteries previously to their distribution. The lym- phatic vessels take their course in two different directions; those of the caecum, ascending and transverse colon, after traversing their pro-THORACIC DUCT. 396 per glands, proceed to the mesenteric, and those of tlie descending colon and rectum to the lumbar glands. The Lymphatic vessels of the kid^icy follow the direction of the blood- vessels to the lumbar glands situated around the aorta and inferior vena cava; those of the supra-renal capsules, which are very large and numerous, terminate in the renal lymphatics. Lymphatic vessels of the viscera of the joe/uis terminate in the sacral and lumbar glands. The Lymphatic vessels of the testicle take the course of the spermatic cord in which they are of large size ; they terminate in the lumbar glands. THORACIC DUCT. The thoracic duct* commences in the abdomen, by a considerable and somewhat triangular dilatation, the receptaculum chyli, which is situated on the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, behind and between the aorta and inferior vena cava, and close to the tendon of the right crus of the diaphragm. From the upper part of the receptaculum chyli the thoracic duct ascends through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and along the front of the ver- tebral column, lying between the thoracic aorta and vena azj'gos, to the fourth dorsal vertebra. It then inclines to the left side, passes behind the arch of the aorta, and ascends by the side of the oesophagus and behind the perpendicular portion of the left subclavian artery to the root of the neck opposite the seventh cervical vertebra, where it makes a sudden curve forwards and downwards, and terminates at the point of junction of the left subclavian with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic duct is equal in size to the diameter of a goose- quill at its commencement from the receptaculum chj^li, diminishes considerably in diameter towards the middle of the posterior me- diastinum, and again becomes dilated near its termination. At about the middle of the thorax it frequently divides into two branches of equal size, which reunite after a short course ; and sometimes it gives olF several branches, which assume a plexiform arrangement in this situation. Occasionally the thoracic duct bifurcates at the upper part of the thorax into two branches, one of which opens into the point of junction between the right subcla\dan and jugu- lar veins, while the other proceeds to the normal termination of the duct on the left side. In rare instances the duct has been found to terminate in the vena azygos, which is its normal destination in some Mammalia.

Within the thorax it is joined by a large lymphatic trunk from the liver, and in its course through the posterior me- diastinum, receives the lym- phatic vessels both from the viscera andfrom the parietes of the thorax. At its curve forwards in the neck it is joined by the lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, left upper extremity, and from the upper part of the thorax, and thoracic viscera.

ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. The nervous system consists of a central organ, the cerebro-spinal centre or axis, and of numerous rounded and flattened white cords, the nerves, which are connected hy one extremity tvith the cerebro- spinal centre, and by the other are distributed to all the textiles of tthe body. The sympathetic system is an exception to tliis description; : for in place of one it has many small centres which are called ganglia, sand which communicate very freely with the cerebro-spinal axis and with its nerves. The cerebro-spinal axis consists of two portions, the brain, an organ of large size, situated within the skull, and the spinal cord, a length- t-ened portion of the nervous centre continuous with the brain, and ^'Occupying the canal of the vertebral column. The most superficial examination of the brain and spinal cord shews tthem to be composed of fibres, or rather fasciculi, which in some situ- ations are ranged in a longitudinal direction, and in others are inter- Llaced at various angles by cross fibres. The fasciculi are connected and held together by a delicate areolar web, which forms the bond of •support to the entire organ. It is also observed that the cerebro- :;pinal axis presents two substances differing from each other in den- .iity and 'colour: a grey or cineritious or cortical substance, and a vhite or medullary substance. The grey substance forms a thin lamella 1 iver the entire surface of the convolutions of the cerebrum, and of Ihe laminae of the cerebellum : hence it has been named cortical ; but ihe grey substance is not confined to the surface of the brain, as this erm would imply; it is likewise situated in the centre of the spinal ord its entire length, and may be thence traced through the medulla ! blongata, crura cerebri, thalami optici, and corpora striata ; it enters iso into the composition of the locus perforatus, tuber cinereum, com- issura mollis, pineal gland, pituitary gland, and corpora rhomboidea. Two kinds of grey substance are described by Rolando as existing 1 the spinal cord ; the one {substantia cinerea spo?igiosa vasculosa) is le ordinary grey matter of the cord, and the other (substantia cinerea zlatinosa) forms part of the posterior cornua. The former resembles I structure the grey matter of the brain, while the latter is composed f' small bodies resembling the blood corpuscules of the frog. The fibres of the cerebro-spinal axis are arranged into two classes, rverging and converging. The diverging fibres proceed from the400 NERVOUS SYSTEM.—DEVELOPMENT. medulla oblongata, and diverge to every part of the surface of the brain; while the converging fibres commence at the surface and pro- ceed inwards towards the centre, so as to connect the diverging fibres of opposite sides. In certain parts of their course the diverging fibres are separated by the grey substance, and increase in number so as to form a body of considerable size, which is called a ganglion. The position and mutual relations of these fibres and ganglia may be best explained by reference to the mode of development of the cerebro- spinal axis in animals and in man. The centre of the nervous system, in the lowest animals possessed of a lengthened axis, presents itself in the form of a double cord. A step higher in the animal scale, and knots or ganglia are developed on one extremity of this cord; such is the most rudimentary condition of the brain in the lowest forms of vertebrata. In the lowest fishes the anterior extremity of the double cord displays a succession of five pairs of ganglia. The higher fishes and amphibia appear to have a different disposition of these primitive ganglia. The first two have become fused into a single ganglion, and then follow only three pairs of sym- metrical ganglia. But if the larger pair be unfolded, after being hardened in alcohol, it will then be seen that the whole number of ganglia exist, but that four have become concealed by a thin covering that has spread across them. This condition of the brain carries us upwards in the animal scale even to Mammalia ; e. g., in the dog or cat we find, first, a single ganglion, the cerebellum ; then three pairs following each other in succession ; and if we unfold the middle pair, we shall be at once convinced that it is composed of two pairs of primitive ganglia concealed by an additional development. Again, it will be observed, that the primitive ganglia of opposite sides, at first separate and disjoined, become connected by means of transverse fibres of communication (commissures ; commissura, a joining). The office of these commissures is the association in function of the two sym- metrical portions. Hence we arrive at the general and important con- clusion, that the brain, among the lower animals, consists of primitive cords, primitive ganglia upon those cords, and commissures which connect the substance of adjoining ganglia, and associate their func- tions. In the development of the cerebro-spinal axis in man, the earliest indication of the spinal cord is presented under the form of a pair of minute longitudinal filaments placed side by side. Upon these, towards the anterior extremity, five pairs of minute swellings are observed, not disposed in a straight line as in fishes, but curved upon each other so as to correspond with the direction of the future cranium. The posterior pair soon become cemented on the middle line, forming a single ganglion; the second pair also imite with each other; the third and foimth pairs, at first distinct, are speedily veiled by a lateral development, which arches backwards and conceals them; the anterior pair, at first very small, decrease in size, and become almost lost in the increased development of the preceding pairs.401 NERVOUS SYSTEJI. STRUCTURE. We see here a chain of resemblances corresponding with the pro- gressive development observed in the lower animals; the human brain is passing through the phases of improving development, which dis- tinguish the lowest from the lower creatures: and we are naturally led to the same conclusion with regard to the architecture of the human brain that we were led to establish as the principle of development in the inferior creatures, namely, that it is composed of primitive cords, primitive ganglia upon those cords, commissures to connect those ganglia, and developnmits from those ganglia. In the adult, the primitive lo7igitudinal cords have become cemented together, to form the spinal cord. But, at the upper extremity, they separate from each other under the name of crmu cerebri. The first pair of ganglia, developed from the primitive cords, have grown into the cerebellum ; the second pair (the optic lobes of animals) have become the corpora qmdrigemina of man. The third pair, the optic tkalami, and the fourth, the cotpora striata, are the basis of the hemi- spheres, which, the merest lamina in the fish, have become the largest portion of the brain in man. And the fifth pair (olfactory lobes), so Large in the lowest forms, have dwindled into the olfactory bulbs of man. The microscopic elements of the nervous system, are, white nerve- fibres, grey nerve-fibres, nerve-cells, and nerve-granules. 1. White nerve fibres are the chief constituent of the brain, the spinal cord, and the cerebro-spinal nerves, and they also enter into the composition of the sympathetic nerve. They present some variety of size in different parts of the nerv- ous system, measuring in the brain between 3^00 and ttstto in diameter, and in the cerebro- ■ spinal nerves between j and ,of an inch. As a general rule, • the white nerve-fibres are largest : in the nerves, smaller where they ■ enter the cerebro-spinal mass, and 5 smallest at their termination, cen- ttrally, in the grey substance of the ^ surface of the brain, and, periphe- rrally, in the tissues of the body.

NERVE CELLS. is composed of a transparent and stnicturelcss cylindrical tubule or sheath (vagina medullaris), and of an axis-cylinder filled with an opalescent, colourless, oil-like fluid (neurine), which coagulates after death, and then resembles a white, opaque, and curd-like matter. The vagina medullaris possesses somewhat less than one-third the thickness of the entire fibre, and gives to the latter, when examined with the microscope, the aspect of a double cylinder,—an appearance which is characteristic of the white nerve-fibre. It is thickest in the fibres of the spinal nerves, and thinnest in those of the spinal cord, brain, and nerves of special sense. Hence in these latter, the sheath, when pressed or stretched, is apt to assume a varicose appearance, and the contained substance to accumulate in small separate masses. White nerve-fibres terminate, both at the surface of the bod\', in the various internal organs, and in the substance of the cerebro-spinal axis, by forming loops. 2. Grey Nerve fibres (fine nerve-fibres, gelatinous fibres, sym- pathetic fibres) are about one-half or one-third less in diameter to of an inch, Henle) than the white fibres. They are les-. transparent, have no appearance of being composed of a double cylin- der, and their sheath is less easily distinguishable from its contents. In structure, they consist of a thin and finely granulated sheath, filled with granular substance, and, when collected into a fasciculus, have a yellowish grey tint. The grey nerve-fibres are abundant in, and are indeed the chief constituent of, the sjmpathetic system. They are also present in the cerebro-spinal nerves, and, most numerously, in the nerves of sensation. They take their origin from the nerve-cells of the grey substance of the brain and spinal cord, from those of the ganglia on the posterior roots of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and from the nerve-cells of the ganglia of the sympathetic system. 3. The Nerve-cells are spherical, or oval, or polyhedral in shape, of a reddish grej" colour, and between and of an inch in diameter. Each cell is composed of a capsular sheath, and contains in its interior a reddish-grey granular substance, and one or more nuclei and nncleoli, the nucleus being attached to the internal surface of the sheath. The sheath of the nerve-cell is constructed of three layers, the outermost consisting of fine granidar corpuscles, the middle of nucleated cells of an oblong figure, and the internal of concentric la- mellae of delicate cylindrical filaments. Dispersed through the sub- stance of the cell are a ■ greater or less number of pigment-granules, some being in the interior, and some in the sheath. Nerve-cells are found in the grey substance of the brain and spinal cord, in the gan- glia of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and in the sj'mpathetic ganglia and nerves. The nerve-cells of the grey substance of the brain are often veiy irregular in shape, and they are also remarkable for their softness and for the thinness of their sheath. It is the pigment-granules, con- tained in the nerve-cells and nerve-granules, that give the peculiar tint of colour to the grey and dark substance of the cerebro-spinal axis.403 NERVE GRANULES. In the grey substance of the brain the nerve-cells may be seen in various stages of progressive development; thus, near the peripherj-, they are minute, spherical or oval, nucleated cells dispersed through a matrix of granular substance ; more deeply, the granular substance is collected around the cells, and forms an exterior coat ; while, at a greater depth, the cells have attained the size and the laminated sheaths of the fully formed nerve-cells. Nerve-cells offer many pecu- liarities in respect of nimiber and arrangement in different parts of the nervous system. From the periphery of the nerve-cells one or more delicate thread- like processes, between loooo ™ diameter, are given off. These are the origins of the grey nerve-fibres. 4. Nerve granules present the three forms of, minute homoge- neous particles, aggregated particles, and nucleated corpuscles, varying in size between TTcnr diameter. They serve as the bond of connexion between the fibres and cells of the brain and spinal cord, particidarly in the grey substance; and enter also into the composition of the various ganglia. Like nerve-cells, nerve-granules contain and have intermingled with them a variable number of pig- ment-granules. In the construction of a nerve the nerve-fibres are collected into small fasciculi, each fasciculus being invested by a distinct neurilem- ma. These fasciculi, again, are collected into bundles, forming larger ■rasciculi, which have also a separate neurilemma; and a bundle of the arger fasciculi, enclosed in a sheath or neurilemma of white fibrous tissue, constitutes a nerve. The neurilemma of the smaller fasciculi s smooth and semitransparent, and remarkable for its satiny polish,— : in appearance which is due to the longitudinal arrangement of the un- lulating fasciculi of fibrous tissue of which it is composed. Another .. haracter which the smaller nervous fasciculi possess, is that of being - rossed by oblique or transverse lines, which are produced, in all pro- .. ability, by the wrinkling of the neurilemma. In the fasciculi of grey fibres the tendency to wrinkle exists in the Kingitudinal direction, and the neurilemma is composed of an inner 1 lyer of circular filaments as well as an outer layer of the longitudinal '-.laments of fibrous tissue. The nerve-fibres have no inosculations, but pursue an uninterrupted )urse from their central to their peripheral termination. In some in- tances they return after a short curve to the cerebro-spinal centre, as, )r example, in the posterior part of the optic commissure, in the two rots of each spinal nerve, and in the loop formed between the descen- ens noni and the upper cervical nerves. In these cases, the fibres )rm a simple arch, both extremities of the arch maintaining a com- umication with the cerebro-spinal axis. In another instance, the irection of the curve is reversed, the centre of the arch being in the iterior part of the optic commissure, and the extremities in the ; !tina. The communications which take place between nerves are termedCONSTRUCTION OF NERVES. 404 plexuses. These plexuses are sometimes formed by the trunks of the nerves, as, the cervical, brachial, and lumbar ; and sometimes by the fasciculi, as in the terminal plexuses at the periphery of the body and at the surface of the brain. The nerve-fibres in the spinal cord and central parts of the brain also form a close and plexiform interlacement with each other. In the construction of the larger plexuses there is a free interchange of fasciculi, and in the terminal plexuses a similar interchange of smaller fasciculi and primitive fibres. It is from the terminal plexuses that the nerve-fibres pass off to form their terminal loops. The general mode of termination of nerve-fibres is by loops. There exists, however, an exception to this ride in the instance of the Paci- nian* corpuscles. These corpuscles are minute bodies, about a line in length, of an oval, oblong, or spheroidal shape, and smooth and glistening aspect, connected with the terminal nerve-fibres of the digi- tal branches of the nerves distributed to the hands and feet. As many as two or three hundred are met with in a single hand. They are also found, but less numerously, on the terminal fibres of other sensitive nerves, and on the fibres of the sympathetic plexuses of the mesentery, of the meso-colon, and of the pancreas. They occur singly and in groups of two or three, and are each connected with the nerve by means of a short pedicle which projects into the corpuscle, and forms a conical process in its interior. The Pacinian corpuscle and its pedicle are composed of about fifty thin and membranous tunics, which are closely adherent in the latter, but are separated in the corpuscle by an albuminous fluid, and towards the free end of the corpuscle, the tunics are connected by imperfect septa. The central tunic or capsule is also filled with fluid, and into this fluid the axis cylinder of a pri- mitive nervous fibril, derived from the nerve and continued through the centre of the peduncle, is prolonged. According to Henle and Kollilier, this nervous fibril generally terminates in a small rounded enlargement; at other times it bifurcates and forms two rounded heads, and occasionally escapes from the corpuscle at its free end. Each of ! the tunics of the Pacinian body is composed of fibres which have a j circular disposition on its external surface, and are arranged in a longi- tudinal direction within. It is these fibres which give to the cor- puscle its glistening appearance. Tjie Pacinian corpuscles are first perceptible during the sixth month of foetal life. On certain of the nerves of the body, for example, on the posterior roots of the cranial and spinal nerves, and particularly on the sympa- thetic, are situated enlargements which are termed ganglia. Ganglia are greyish in colour, are invested by a smooth membranous sheath, and are composed of the three essential constituents of the nervous s3'-stem, namely, nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, and nerve-granules. The nerve-cells of ganglia are firm in structure, and have stronger investing * Discovered and described by Pacini in 1831; described more particularly in 1840; and by Henle and Kolliker in 1844.405 CLASSIFICATION OF NERVES. sheaths than those of the brain. From the exterior of their sheaths, filaments of fibrous tissue are given off, which interlace with each other, and hold the cells together ; and at the same time form an in- vesting network around the entire ganglion, the nerve-fibres passing into and out of the ganglion through the interstices of this network. Besides the sheath-filaments, certain of the nerve-cells give off grey fibres, while others -are free. The nerve-fibres of ganglia are of the two kinds met with in the rest of the nervous system. The white-fibres are derived from the cerebro-spinal axis, and enter the sympathetic through the so-called roots of that nerve, namely, its communications with the spinal nerves. In the ganglia these white fibres separate, and either pass directly onwards between the nerve-cells (traversing fibres), or make a series of turns around them (winding fibres) ; in either case, they collect together after a plexiform course between the neiwe-cells, and form fasciculi, which pass off as branches from the ganglion. The grey nerve-fibres originate from certain of the nerve- cells within the ganglion as finely granular threads, and pass away in the form of fasciculi, with or without association with the white fibres, to be distributed to the various organs, or to traverse other ganglia previously to their distribution. The Nerve-granules occupy the in- terstices between the nen^e-cells and the nerve-fibres as in the cerebro- spinal mass. They are also continued ■with the nerve-fibres, into some of the nerves given off by the ganglia. Like the interstitial substance of the brain, the granular substance (gelatinous substance) of ganglia has intermingled with it minute cells and pigment- granules. Nerves are divisible into two great classes; those which proceed directly from the cerebro-spinal axis, the cranial and spinal nerves, and constitute the system of animal life; and those which originate from the sympatlietic system, or system of organic life. The division of nerves into cranial and spinal is purelj’’ arbitrary, and depends on the circumstance of the fonner passing through the fora- mina of the cranium, and the latter through those of the vertebral ;oIumn. With respect to origin, all the cranial nerves, with the ex- leption of the first, [olfactory,] proceed from the spinal cord, or from .• ts immediate prolongation into the brain. The spinal nerves arise by wo roots ; anterior, which proceeds from the anterior segment of the pinal cord, and possesses a motor function; and posterior, which is onnected with the posterior segment, and bestows the faculty of sen- ation. The motor nerves of the cranium are shown by dissection to )e continuous with the motor portion of the cord, and form one system vith the motor roots of the spinal cord; while the nerves of sensation, •Iways excepting the olfactory, are in like manner traced to the poste- ior segment of the cord, and form part of the system of sensation. To hese two systems a third was added by Sir Charles Bell, the respira- or,' system, which consists of nerves associated in the function of re- ■piration, and arising from the side of the upper part of the spinal cord n one continuous line, which he thence named the respiratory tract.406 ORIGIN OF NERV'ES, The microscope has failed in making out any structural distinction be- tween the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves ; but the latter are remarkable for the possession of a ganglion near their attach- ment with the cord. This ganglion is observed upon the posterior roots of all the spinal nerves, and also upon the corresponding root of the fifth cranial nerve, which is thence considered a spinal cranial nerve. Upon others of the cranial nerves a ganglion is found, which associates them in function with the nerves of sensation, and establishes an analogy with the spinal nerves. According to Mr. Grainger, both roots of the spinal nerves, as well as of most of the cerebral, divide into two sets of fibres upon entering the cord, one set being connected with the grey substance, while the other is continuous with the white or fibrous part of the cord. The former he considers to be the agents of the excito-motory system of Dr. Marshall Hall; and the latter, the communication with the brain and the medium for the transmission of sensation and volition. He has not been able to trace the fibres which enter the grey substance to their termination ; but he thinks it probable that the ultimate fibres of the posterior root join those of the anterior root; or, in the words of Dr. Marshall Hall’s system, that the incident fibres (sensitive) are continuous with the reflex (motor). The connection of a nerve with the cerebro-spinal axis is called, for convenience of description, its origin: this tenn must not, however, be taken literally, for each nerve is developed in the precise situation which it occupies in the body, and with the same relations that it pos- sesses in after life. Indeed, we not unfrequently meet with instances, in anencephalous foetuses, where the nerves are beautifull}’ and com- pletely formed, while the brain and spinal cord are wanting. The word “ origin ” must therefore be considered as a relict of the darkness of preceding ages, when the cerebro-spinal axis was looked upon as the tree from which the nerves pushed forth as branches. In their distri- bution, the spinal nerves for the most part follow the course of the ar- teries, particularly in the limbs, where they lie almost constantly to the outer side and superficially to the vessels, as if for the purpose of receiving the first intimation of danger and of communicating it to the muscles, that the latter may instantly remove the arteries from im- pending injury. The Sympathetic system consists of numerous ganglia, of communi- cating branches passing between the ganglia, of others passing be- tween the ganglia and the cerebro-spinal axis, and of branches of dis- tribution which are remarkable for their frequent and plexiform com- munications. The sympathetic nerves also differ from other nerves in their colour, , which is of a grejflsh pearly tint. The capillary vessels of nerves are very minute. They run parallel with the nervous fasciculi, and every here and there are connected by transverse communications, so as to give rise to a net-work composed of oblong meshes very similar to the capillary system of muscles. The nervous system may be divided for convenience of descriptionBRAIN.—MEMBRANES. 407 into 1. The brain. 2. The spinal cord. 3. The cranial nerves. 4. The spinal nerves. 5. The sympathetic system. THE BRAIN. The brain is a collective term which signifies those parts of the nervous system, exclusive of the nerves themselves, which are contain- ed within the cranium; they are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and me- dulla oblongata.* These are invested and protected by the membranes of the brain, and the whole together constitute the encephalon (Iv xi(pxXh, within the head). MEMBRANES OF THE ENCEPHALON. Dissection.—To examine the encephalon with its membranes, the upper part of the skull must be removed, by sawing through the ex- ternal table and breaking the internal table with the chisel and ham- mer. After the calvarium has been loosened all round, it will require a considerable degree of force to tear the bone away from the dura mater. This adhesion is particularly firm at the sutures, where the dura mater is continuous with a membranous layer interposed between the edges of the bones ; in other situations, the connection results from numerous vessels which permeate the inner table of the skull. The adhesion subsisting between the dura mater and bone is greater in the young subject and in old persons than in the adult. On being tom away, the internal table will present numerous deeply grooved and ramified channels, corresponding with the branches of the arteria meningea media. Along the middle line will be seen a groove corresponding with the superior longitudinal sinus, and on either side may be frequently observed some small fossae, corresponding with the Pacchionian bodies. The membranes of the encephalon are the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. The Dura maters is the firm, whitish or grej'ish layer which is brought into view when the calvarium is removed. It is a strong fibrous membrane, somewhat laminated in texture, and composed of white fibrous tissue. Lining the interior of the cranium, it serves as the internal periosteum of that cavity; it is prolonged also into the spinal column, under the name of theca vertebralis, but is not adherent to the bones in that canal as in the cranium. From the internal sur- face of the dura mater, processes are directed 'inwards for the support and protection of parts of the brain ; while from its exterior, other pro- • The weight of the human brain, according to Scemmering, is 2 ft.

Its external surface is rough and fibrous, and corresponds with the internal table of the skull. The in- ternal surface is smooth, and lined by the thin varnish-like lamella of the arachnoid membrane. The latter is a serous membrane.. Hence the dura mater becomes a fLro-serous membrane, being composed of its own proper fibrous structure, and the serous layer derived from the arachnoid. There are two other instances of fibro-serous membrane in the body, formed in the same way, namely, the pericardium and tunica albuginea of the testicle. On the external surface of the dura mater the branches of the middle meningeal artery may be seen ramifying; and in the middle line is a depressed groove, formed by the subsidence of the upper wall of the superior longitudinal sinus. If the sinus be opened along its course, it will be found to be a triangular channel, crossed at its lower angle by numerous white bands, called chordae Willisii"; granu- lar bodies are also occasionally seen in its interior, these are glandulae Pacchioni. The Glandules Pacchionis are small, round, whitish granulations, oc- curring singly or in clusters, and forming small groups of various size along the margin of the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, and more particularly near the summit of the latter. These bodies would seem to be of morbid origin ; they are absent in infancy, increase in numbers in adult life, and are abundant in the aged. They are generally asso- ciated with opacity of the arachnoid aroimd their bases, but in some instances are wanting even in the adult. They have their point of attachment in the pia mater, from which they seem to spring, carrying with them the arachnoid membrane, and then, in proportion to their size, producing various effects upon contiguous parts. For example, when small, they remain free or constitute a bond of adhesion between the visceral and parietal layer of the arachnoid; when of larger size they produce absorption of the dura mater, and as the degree of ab- sorption is greater or less, they protrude through that membrane, and form depressions on the inner surface of the cranium, or simply render the dura mater thin and cribriform. Sometimes they cause absorption of the wall of the longitudinal sinus, and projecting into its cavity, give rise to the granulations described in connection with that channel. If the student cut through one side of the dura mater, in the direc- tion of his incision through the skull, and turn it upwards towards the middle line, he will observe the smooth internal surface of this mem- brane. He will perceive also the large veins of the hemispheres filled * Willis lived in the seventeenth century; he was a great defender of the opinions of Harvey. t These bodies are incorrectly described as conglobate glands by Pacchioni, in an epistolatoiy dissertation, “De Glandulis conglobatis Duras Meninps indeque ortis Lymphaticis ad Piam Matrem productis,” published at Rome, in 1705.409 DURA MATER.—PROCESSK.S. with dark blood, and passing from behind forwards to open into the superior longitudinal sinus; and the firm connection, by means of these veins and the Pacchionian bodies, between the opposed surfaces of the arachnoid membrane. If he separate these adhesions with his scalpel, he will see a vertical layer of dura mater descending between the hemispheres; and if he draw one side of the brain a little outwards, he will be enabled to perceive the extent of the process of membrane, which is called the falx cerebri. The processes of dura mater which are sent inwards towards the in- terior of the skull, are the falx cerebH, tentorium cerebelli, and falx carebelU. The Falx cerebri (falx, a sickle), so named from its sickle-like ap- pearance, narrow in front, broad behind, and forming a sharp curved edge below, is attached in front to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone, and behind to the tentorium cerebelli. The Tentorium cerebelli (tentorium, a tent) is a roof of dura mater, throT^m across the cerebellum and attached at each side to the mar- gin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; behind, to the trans- verse ridge of the occipital bone, which lodges the lateral sinuses ; and to the clinoid processes in front. It supports the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and prevents their pressure* on the cerebellum, leaving only a small opening anteriorly, for the transmission of the crura cerebri. The Falx cerebelli is a small process, generally double, attached to the vertical ridge of the occipital bone beneath the lateral sinus, and to the tentorium. It is received into the indentation between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. The layers of the dura mater separate in several situations, so as to form irregular channels which receive the venous blood. These are the sinuses of the dura mater, which have been described at page 370. The student cannot see the tentorium and falx cerebelli until the brain is removed; but he should consider the attachments of the for- mer on the dried skull, for he will have to incise it in the removal of the brain. He should now proceed to that operation, for which pur- pose the dura mater is to be incised all round, on a level with the sec- tion through the skull, and the scissors are to be carried deeply be- tween the hemispheres of the brain in front, to cut through the ante- rior part of the falx ; then draw the dura mater backwards, and leave it hanging by its attachment to the tentorium. Raise the anterior lobes of the hrain carefully with the hand, and lift the olfactory bulbs from the cribriform fossae with the handle of the scalpel. Then cut across the two optic nerves and internal carotid arteries. Next divide the infundibulum and third nerves, and carry the knife along the mar- gin of the petrous bone at each side, so as to divide the tentorium * In leaping animals, as the feline and canine genera, the tentorium forms a bony tent.410 ARACHNOID MEMBRANE. near its attachment. Cut across the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves in succession with a sharp knife, and pass tlie scalpel as far down as possible into the vertebral canal, to sever the spinal cord, cutting first to one side and then to the other, in order to divide the vertebral arteries and first cervical nerves. Then let him press the cerebellum gently upwards with the fingers of the right hand, the he- mispheres being supported with the left, and the brain will roll into his hand. The Arteries of the dura mater are the anterior meningeal from the ethmoidal, ophthalmic, and internal carotid. The middle meningeal and meningea parva from the internal maxillary. The inferior meningeal from the ascending pharyngeal and occipital arteries; and the posterior meningeal from the vertebral. Its Nerves are derived from the nervi molles and vertebral plexus of the sympathetic, from the Gasserian ganglion, the ophthalmic nerve, and sometimes frpm the fourth. The branches from the two latter are given off while those nerves are situated by the side of the sella tur- cica ; they are recurrent, and pass backwards between the la3*ers of the tentorium, to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. Purkinje describes a sympathetic plexus of considerable size, as being situated around the vena Galeni at its entrance into the fourth sinus. The filaments from this plexus are distributed to the tentorium. Arachnoid membrane. The Arachnoid u^os, like a spider’s web), so named from its extreme tenuity, is the serous membrane of the cerebro-spinal centre; and, like other serous membranes, a shut sac. It envelopes the brain and spinal cord (visceral layer) and is reflected upon the inner surface of the dura mater (parietal layer), giving to that membrane its serous investment. On the upper surface of the hemispheres the arachnoid is trans- parent, but may be demonstrated as it passes across the sulci from one convolution to another by injecting, with a blow-pipe, a stream of air beneath it. At the base of the brain the membrane is opalescent and thicker than in other situations, and more easily demonstrable from the circumstance of stretching across the interval between the middle lobes of the hemispheres. The space which is included between this layer of membrane and those parts of the base of the brain which are boimded by the optic commissure and fissures of Sylvius in front, and the pons Varolii behind, is tenned the anterior sub-arachnoidean space. Another space formed in a similar manner, between the under part of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata, is the posterior sub-araclmoi- dean space; and a third space, situated over the corpora quadrigeminii, may be termed the superior suh-arachnoidean space. These spaces communicate freely with each other, the anterior and posterior across the crura cerebelii, the anterior and the superior around the crura cere-411 PIA MATER. bri, and the latter and the posterior across the cerebellum in the course of the vermifonn processes. They communicate also with a still larger space fonned by the loose disposition of the arachnoid around the spinal cord, the spinal sub-arachnoidcan space. The whole of these spaces, with the lesser spaces between the convolutions of the hemi- spheres, constitute one large and continuous cavity which is filled with a limpid, serous secretion, the sub-aracimoideanfluid* a fluid which is necessary to the maintenance and protection of the cerebro-spinal mass. The quantity of the siib-arachnoidean fluid is determined by the re- lative size of the cerebro-spinal axis and that of the containing cavity, and is consequently verj”^ variable. It is smaller in youth than in old age, and in the adult has been estimated at about two ounces. The visceral layer of the arachnoid is connected to the pia mater by a de- licate areolar tissue, which in the sub-arachnoidean spaces is loose and filamentous. The serous secretion of the true cavity of the arachnoid is- very small in quantity as compared with the sub-arachnoidean fluid. The arachnoid does not enter into the ventricles of the brain, as imagined by Bichat, but is reflected inwards upon the venae Galeni for a short distance only, and returns upon those vessels to the dura mater of the tentorium. It surrounds the nerves as they originate from the brain, and forms a sheath around them to their point of exit from the skull. It is then reflected back upon the inner surface of the dura mater. According to Mr. Rainey,+ vessels of considerable size, but few in number; and branches of cranial nerves are found in the arachnoid. He also describes, in this membrane, numberless plexuses and ganglia, which he considers to be analogous to those of the sympathetic nerve. The fibres proceeding from this source are distributed on the arteries and nerves of the cerebro-spinal axis, but particularly on the former. % Pia mater. The Pia maler is a vascular membrane composed of innumerable vessels held together by a thin layer of areolar tissue. It invests the ■ whole surface of the brain, dipping into the sulci between the convolu- •tions, and forming a fold in its interior called velum interpositum. It ; also forms folds in other situations, as in the third and fourth ven- rtricles, and in the longitudinal fissures of the spinal cord. This membrane differs very strikingly in its structure in different ; parts of the cerebro-spinal axis. Thus, on the surface of the cerebrum, : in contact with the soft grey matter of the brain, it is extremely vascu- • The presence of a serous fluid beneath the arachnoid has given rise to the [' ;onjecture that a sub-arachnoid serous membrane may exist in that situation. Much a supposition is quite unnecessary to explain the production of the secre- 1 .ion, since the pia mater is fully adequate to that function, t 3Iedico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. 29.412 CEREHRUM. lar, forming remarkable loops of anastomoses in the interspaces of the convolutions, and distributing multitudes of minute straight vessels to the grey substance. In the substantia perforata, again, and locus perforatus, it gives off tufts of small arteries, which pierce the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. But upon the crura cerebri, pons Varolii, and spinal cord, its vascular character seems almost lost. It has become a dense fibrous membrane, difficult to tear off, and forming the proper sheath of the spinal cord. The pia mater is the nutrient membrane of the brain, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Its Nerves are the minute filaments of the sympathetic, which ac- compan}*^ the branches of the arteries. CEREBRUM. The Cerebrum presents on its surface a number of slightly convex elevations, the convolutions, (gyri) which are separated from each other by sulci of various depth.* It is divided superiorlj’^ into two hemispheres by the great longitudinal fissure, which lodges the falx cerebri, and marks the original development of the brain by two symmetrical halves. Each hemisphere, upon its imder surface, admits of a division into three lobes, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior lobe rests upon the roof of the orbit, and is separated from the middle by the fissure of Sylvius.t The middle lobe is received into the middle fossae of the base of the skull, and is separated from the posterior by a slight impression produced by the ridge of the petrous bone. The posterior lobe is supported by the tentorium. If the upper part of one hemisphere, at about one-third from its summit, be removed with a scalpel, a centre of white substance will be observed, surrounded by a narrow border of grey, which follows the line of the sulci and convolutions, and presents a zigzag form. This section from exhibiting the largest surface of medullary substance de- monstrable in a single hemisphere is called centrum ovale minus; it is .• spotted by numerous small red points (puncta vasculosa) which are produced by the escape of blood from the cut ends of minute arteries and veins. Now separate carefully the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, and a broad band of white substance (corpus callosum) will be seen to con- nect them; it will be seen also that the surface of the hemisphere where it comes in contact with the corpus callosum is bounded b}' a large convolution (gyrus fornicatus) which lies horizontally on that * In estimating the surface of the brain, which, according to Baillaiger, averages in round numbers, 670 square inches, these convolutions and the laminae of the cerebellum are supposed to be unfolded. t James Dubois, a celebrated professor of anatomy in Paris, where he suc- ceeded Vidius in 1550, although known much earlier by his works and dis- coveries, but particularly by his violence in the defence of Galen.

The sulcus between this convolution and the corpus callosum has been termed, very improperly, the “ ventricle of the corpus callosum,” and some longitudinal fibres (striae longitudinales laterales), which are brought into view when the convolution is raised, were called by Reil the “■ covered band.” If, now, the upper part of each hemisphere be removed to a level with the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medulliiry matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey substance corre- sponding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemispheres, will be seen ; this is the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens.

Posteriorly it forms a thick rounded fold (splenium), which is continuous with the fornix. The length of the corpus callosum is about four inches. Beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum is the transverse fissure of the cerebrum, which extends between the hemi- spheres and crura cerebri from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, to the same point on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the velum interpositum. And it was here that Bichat conceived the arachnoid to enter the ven- tricles ; hence it is also named the fissure of Bichat. Along the middle line of the corpus callosum is the raph6, a linear depression between two slightly elevated longitudinal bands (chordae longitudinales, Lancisii) ; and, on either side of the raphe, may be seen the linew trunsversce, which mark the direction of the fibres of which the corpus callosum is composed. These fibres may be traced into the hemispheres on either side, and they will be seen to be crossed at about an inch from the raphe by the longitudinal fibres of the covered band of Reil. Anteriorly and posteriorly the fibres of the corpus cal- losum curve into their corresponding lobes. If, now, a superficial incision be made through the corpus callosum on either side of the raphe, two irregular cavities will be opened, which extend from one extremity of the hemispheres to the other: these are the lateral ventricles. To expose them completelj', their upper boundary should be removed with the scissors. In making this dissection the thin and diaphanous membrane of the ventricles may frequently be seen. Lateral ventricles.—Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central cavity, and three smaller cavities called cornua. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards in the anterior lobe ; the middle cornu descends into the middle lobe; and the posterior cornu passes backwards in the posterior lobe, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. The central cavity is triangular in form, being bounded above (roof) by the corpus callossum; internally by the septum luci- dum, which separates it from the opposite ventricle; and below (floor) by the following parts, taken in their order of position from before backwards:— Corpus striatum. Tenia semicircularis. Thalamus opticus. Choroid plexus. Corpus fimbriatum. Fornix. The Corpus striatum is named from the striated lines of white and grey matter which ai-e seen upon cutting into its substance. It is415 CORPUS STRIATUM. grey on the exterior, and of a pyriform shape.

The corpora striata are the superior ganglia of the cerebrum. The Tenia seinicircularis (tenia, a fillet) is a narrow band of medul- lary substance, extending along the posterior border of the corpus striatum, and serving as a bond of connection between that body and the thalamus opticus. The tenia is partly concealed by a large vein {vena corporis striati), which terminates in the vena Galeni of its own side. The vein is formed by small vessels from the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, and is overlaid by a yellowish band, a thicken- ing of the lining membrane of the ventricle. This was first noticed and described by Tarinus, under the name of the hornp band. 'SYe may therefore term it, tenia Tarini.* The Thalamus opticus (thalamus, a bed) is an oblong body, having a thin coating of white substance on its surface; it has received its name from giving origin to one root of the optic nerve. It is the inferior ganglion of the cerebrum. Part only of the thalamus is seen in the floor of the lateral ventricle ; we must, therefore, defer its fur- ther description until we can examine it in its entire extent. The Choroid pleocus {xi^tov, resembling the chorion +) is a vas- cular fringe extending obliquely across the floor of the lateral ventricle, and sinking into the middle cornu. Anteriorly, it is small and taper- ing, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventri- cle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius. This foramen may be distinctly seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum lucidum with the handle of the knife. It is situated between the under surface of the fornix, and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, and forms a communication transversely between the lateral ventricles, and perpendicularly with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus presents upon its surface a number of minute vascular processes, which are termed villi. Thej'' are invested by a very delicate epithelium, surmounted by cilia, which have been seen in active movement in the embryo. In their interior the plexuses not unfrequently contain particles of calcareous matter, and they are sometimes covered by small clusters of serous cysts. The Corpus fimbriatum is a narrow white band, which is situated immediately behind the choroid plexus, and extends with it into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thin edge of the fornix, and being attached to the hippocampus major in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, it is also termed, tenia hippocampi. The Fornix is a white layer of medullary substance, of which a portion only is seen in this view of the ventricle. The Anterior cornu is triangular in its form, sweeping outwards, * Peter Tarin, a French anatomist; his work, entitled “ Adversaria Anato- mica,” was published in 1750. + See the note appended to the description of the choroid coat of the eye- ball.417 CORNUA OF THK LATERAL VENTRICLES. and terminating by a point in the anterior lobe of the brain, at a short distance from its surface. The Posterior cornu or digital cavity curves inwards, as it extends back into the posterior lobe of the brain, and likewise terminates near the surface. An elevation corresponding with a deep sulcus between two convolutions projects into the area of this cornu, and is called the hippocampus minor. The JMiddle or descending cornu, in descending into the middle lobe of the brain, forms a very considerable curve, and alters its direction several times as it proceeds. Hence it is described as passing back- wards and outwards and downwards, and then turning forwards and inwards. This complex expression of a very simple curve has given origin to a symbol formed by the primary letters of these various terms; and by means of this the student recollects with ease the course of the cornu, bodfi. It is the largest of the three cornua, and termi- nates close to the fissure of Sylvius, after having curved around the crus cerebri. The middle cornu should now be laid open, by inserting the little finger into its cavity, and making it serve as a director for the scalpel in cutting away the side of the hemisphere, so as to expose it com- pletely. The Superior boundary of the middle cornu is formed by the under surface of the thalamus opticus, upon which are the two projections called corpus geniculatum internum and externum; and the inferior xcall by the various parts which are sometimes spoken of as the contents of the middle cornu: these are the— Hippocampus major, Pes hippocampi, Pes accessorius. Corpus fimbriatum. Choroid plexus, Fascia dentata. Transverse fissure. The Hippocampus major or cornu Ammonis, so called from its re- • semblance to a ram’s horn, the famous crest of Jupiter Ammon, is a i considerable projection from the inferior wall, and extends the whole : length of the middle cornu. Its extremity is likened to the foot of lan animal, from its presenting a number of knuckle-like elevations .upon the surface, and is named pes hipjiocampi. The hippocampus major is the internal surface of the convolution (gyrus fornicatus) of the lateral edge of the hemisphere, the convolution which has been pre- viously described as lying upon the corpus callosmn and extending ; downwards to the base of the brain to terminate at the fissure of Sylvius. If it be cut across, the section will be seen to resemble the extremity of i convoluted scroll, consisting of alternate layers of white and grey substance. The hippocampus major is continuous superiorly with the E E418 FORNIX, fornix and corpus callosum, deriving from Ihe latter its medullarj’ layer. The Pes accessorius is a swelling somewhat resembling the hippo- campus major, but smaller in size; it is situated on the outer wall of the cornu, and is frequently absent. The Corpus firrUmatum (tenia hippocampi) is the narrow white band which is prolonged from the central cavity of the ventricle, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major. It is lost inferiorly on the hippocampus. Fascia dentata:—if the corpus finibriatum he carefully raised, a nar- row serrated band of grey substance, the margin of the grey substance of the middle lobe, will be seen beneath it; this is the fascia dentata. Beneath the corpus fimbriatum will be likewise seen the transTerse fissure of the brain, which has been before described as extending from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, across to the same point on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the choroid plexus, and the latter obtains its sup- ply of blqod. The fissure is bounded on one side by the corpus fim- briatum, and on the other by the under surface of the thalamus opticus. The internal boundary of the lateral ventricle is the septum lucidum. This septum is thin and semi-transparent, and consists of two laminae of cerebral substance attached above to the under surface of the corpus callosum at its anterior part, and below to the fornix. Between the two layers is a narrow space, the fifth ventriele, which is lined by a proper membrane. The fifth ventricle may be shown, by snipping through the septum lucidum transversely with the scissors. The corpus callosum should now be cut across towards its anterior extremity, and the two ends carefully dissected away. The anterior portion will be retained only by the septum lucidum, but the posterior will be foimd incoi’porated with the white layer beneath, which is the fornix. Fornix.—The fornix (arch) is a triangular lamina of white sub- stance, broad behind, and extending into each lateral ventricle: narrow in front, where it terminates in two crura, which arch downwards to the base of the brain. The two crura descend in a curved direction to the base of the brain, embedded in grey substance, in the lateral walls of the third ventricle, and lying directly behind the anterior commis- sure. At the base of the brain they make a sudden curve upon them- selves and constitute the corpora albicantia, from which they may be traced upwards to their origin in the thalami optici. Opening trans- versely beneath these two crura, just as they are about to arch down- wards, is the foramen of commmiication between the lateral and the third ventricles, the foramen of Monro; ox foramen commune anterius. The choroid plexuses communicate, and the veins of the corpora striata pass through this opening. The lateral thin edges of the fornix are continuous posteriorly with the concave border of the hippocampus major at each side, and formFORNIX. 419 the narrow white band called corpm fimhriatum (posterior crus of the fornix). In the middle line the fornix is continuous with the corpus callosum, and at each side with the hippocampus major and minor. Upon the under surface of the fornix towards its posterior part, some transverse lines are seen passing between the diverging corpora fim- briata : this appearance is termed the lyra (corpus psalloides), from a fancied resemblance to the strings of a harp. The fornix may now be removed by dividing it across anteriorly, and turning it backwards, at the same time separating its lateral con Fig. 143.* » The mesial surface of a longitudinal section of the brain.

If the student examine its under sur- face, he will perceive the lyra above described. Beneath the fornix is the velum interpositum, a duplicature of pia mater introduced into the interior of the brain, through the transverse fissure. The velum is continuous at each side with the choroid plexus, and contains in its inferior layer two large veins (the venae Oaleni) which receive the blood from the corpora striata and choroid plexuses, and terminate posteriorly, after uniting into a single trunk, in the straight sinus. Upon the under surface of the velum interpositum are two fringe-like bodies, which project into the third ventricle. These are the elioroid plexuses of the third ventricle; posteriorly these fringes en- close the pineal gland. If the velum interpositum be raised and turned back, an operation which must be conducted with care,' particularly at its posterior part where it invests the pineal gland, the thalami optici and the cavity of the third ventricle will be brought into view. Thalami optici.—The thalami optici are two oblong, square-shaped bodies, of a white colour superficially, inserted between the two di- verging portions of the corpora striata. In the middle line a fissure exists between them, which is called the third ventricle. Posteriorly and inferiorly, they form the superior wall of the descending cornu, and present two rounded elevations called corpus genicidatum externum and internum. The corpus geniculatum externum is the larger of the two, and of a greyish colour; it is the principal origin of the optic nerve. Anteriorly, the thalami are connected with the corpora albicantia by means of two white bands, which appear to originate in the white substance uniting the thalami to the corpora striata. Ex- ternally they are in relation with the coi’pora striata and hemispheres. In their interior the thalami are composed of white fibres mixed with grey substance. They are essentially the inferior ganglia of the cerebrum. Third ventricle.—The third ventricle is the fissure between the two thalami optici. It is bounded above by the under surface of the velum interpositum, from which are suspended the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Its floor is formed by the grey substance of the anterior termination of the corpus callosum, called lamina cinerea, tlie tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus. Laterally it is bounded by the thalami optici; anteriorly by the anterior commissure and crura of the fornix; and posteriorly by the posterior commissure and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. The third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, anterior, middle, and posterior; and between these are two spaces, called foramen commune anterius and foramen commune posterius. The Anterior commissure is a small rounded white cord, which enters the corpus striatum at either side, and spreads out in the substance of the hemispheres ; the middle., or soft commissure consists of grey matter, which is continuous with the grey lining of the ventricle, it connects the adjacent sides of the thalami optici; the p>osterior commissure,421 CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA. smaller than the anterior, is a rounded white cord, connecting the two thalanii optici posteriorly. The space between the anterior and middle commissure is called the foramen commune anferius, and is that to which Monro has given his name (foramen of Monro). It is the medium of communication be- tween the lateral and third ventricles and it transmits superiorly the choroid plexus and the venae corponim striatorum. The foramen com- mime anterius is also termed, iter ad infundibulum, from leading down- wards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum. The crura of the fornix are embedded in the lateral walls of the foramen commune, and are concealed from view in this situation by the layer of grey sub- stance which lines the interior of the third ventricle. If the crura be slightly separated, the anterior commissure will be seen immediately in front of them, crossing from one corpus striatum to the other. The space between the middle and posterior commissure is the foramen commune posterius; it is much shallower than the preceding, and is the origin of a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum, which leads backwards beneath the posterior commissure and through the base of the corpora quadrigemina to the upper part of the fourth ventricle. Corpora quadrigemina.—The corpora quadrigemina, or optic lobes, are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and poste- rior commissure; and beneath the posterior border of the corpus cal- losum. They form, indeed, at this point, the inferior boundary of the transverse fissure of the hemispheres, the fissure of Bichat. The anterior pair of these bodies are grey in colour, and are named nates: the posterior pair are white and much smaller than the anterior ; they are termed testes. From the nates on each side may be traced a rounded process (brachium anterius) which passes obliquely outwards into the thalamus opticus ; and from the testis a similar but smaller process (brachium posterius) which has the same destination. The corpus geniculatum internum lies in the interval of these two pro- cesses where they enter the thalamus, and behind the brachium pos- terius is a prominent band (laqueus) which marks the course of the superior division of the fasciculus olivaris. The corpora quadrigemina are perforated longitudinally through their base by the aqueduct of Sylvius; they are covered in partly by the pia mater and partly by the velum interpositum, and the nates form the base of support of the pineal gland. Pineal Gland.—The pineal gland is a small reddish grey body of a conical form (hence its synonym conarium), situated on the anterior part of the nates and invested by a duplicature of pia mater derived from the under part of the velum interpositum. The pineal gland, when pressed between the fingers is found to contain a gritty matter (acervulus) composed chemically of phosphate and carbonate of lime and is sometimes hollow in the interior. It is connected to the brain by means of two medullary cords called peduncles and a thin lamina derived from the posterior commissure; the peduncles of the pineal422 FOURTH VENTRICLE. gland are attached to the thalami optici, and may he traced along the upper and inner margin of those bodies to the crura of the fornix with which they become blended. From the close connection subsisting between the pia mater and the pineal gland, and the softness of tex- ture of the latter, the gland is liable to be torn away in the removal of the pia mater. Behind the corpora quadrigemina is the cerebellum, and beneath the cerebellum the fourth ventricle. The student must therefore divide the cerebellum down to the fourth ventricle, and turn its lobes aside to examine that cavity. Fourth ventricle.—The fourth ventricle (sinus rhomboidalis) is the ventricle of the medulla oblongata, upon the posterior surface of \vhich, and of the pons Varolii, it is placed. It is a lozenge-shaped cavity, hounded on each side by a thick cord passing between the cerebellum and corpora quadrigemina, called the processus e cerebello ad testes, and by the corpus restiforme. It is covered in behind by the cerebellum, and by a thin lamella of medullary substance, stretched between the two processus e cerebello ad testes, termed the valve of Vieussens* That portion of the cerebellum which forms the posterior boundary of the fourth ventricle, presents four small prominences or lobules, and a thin layer of medullary substance, the velum medvllare posterius. Of the lobules two are placed in the middle line, the nodulus and uvula, the former being before the latter; the remaining two are named amygdalae, or tonsils, and are situated one on either side of the uvula. They all project into the cavity of the fourth ventricle, and the velum medullare posterius is situated in front of them. The valve of Vieussens or velum medullare anterius is an extremely thin lamella of medullary substance, prolonged from the white matter of the cerebellum to the testes, and attached on each side to the processus e cerebello ad testes. This lamella is overlaid for a short distance by a thin, transversely- grooved lobule of grey substance (linguetta laminosa) derived from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and its junction with the testes is strengthened by a narrow slip given off by the commissure of those bodies, the fraenvlum veli medullaris anterioris. The anterior wall, or floor of the fourth ventricle is formed by two slightly convex bodies, processus teretes or posterior pyramids, separated by a longitudinal groove which is continuous inferiorly with the fissura longitudinalis posterior of the spinal cord. The processus teretes are crossed transversely by several white and grey fasciculi {linece transversce) the origin of the auditory nerves. And upon the lower part of the floor of this ventricle is an impression resembling the point of a pen, and hence named calamus scriptorius; the lateral boundaries of the calamus are the processus clavati of the posterior median columns of the spinal cord. Above, the fourth ventricle is bounded by the corpora quadrigemina and aqUeduct * Ba)onond Vieussens, a great discoverer in the anatomy of the brain and nervous system. His “Neurographia Universalis ” was published at Lyons, in 1685.LINING MEMBRANE OF THE VENTRICLES. 423 of Sylvius; and heloic by a layer of pia mater and arachnoid, called the valve of the arachnoid. It is by rupture of this latter that a com- munication is established between the ventricles of the brain and the sub-arachnoidean space. Within the fourth ventricle and lying against the uvula and tonsils are two small vascular fringes formed by the pia mater, the choroid plea;uses of the fourth ventricle. The fourth ven- tricle is lined by grey matter derived from the interior of the spinal cord, the grey matter being partly concealed by a thin expansion of white substance. LINING MEMBRANE OF THE VENTRICLES. The lining membrane of the ventricles is a serous layer distinct from the arachnoid; it lines the whole of the interior of the lateral ventri- cles, and is connected above and below with the attached border of the choroid plexus, so as to exclude all communication between the ventri- cles and the exterior of the brain. From the lateral ventricles it is re- flected through the foramen of Monro on each side, into the third ven- tricle, which it invests throughout. From the third it is conducted into the fourth ventricle, through the iter a tertio ad quartum ventri- culum, and lines its interior, together with a layer of pia mater which forms its inferior boundary. In this manner a perfect communication is established between all the ventricles, with the exception of the fifth, which has its own proper membrane. It is this membrane which gives them their polished surface, and transudes the secretion which moistens their interior. When the fluid accumulates to an unnatural degree, it may then break down this layer and the layer of pia mater at the bottom of the fourth ventricle, and thus make its way into the sub- arachnoidean space; but in the normal condition it is doubtful whether a communication exists between the interior of the ventricles and the serous ca\*ity of the sub-arachnoidean space. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum (figs. 143, 144, 145), seven times smaller than the cerebrum, is situated beneath the posterior lobes of the latter, being lodged in the posterior fossa of the base of the cranium, and protected from the superincumbent pressure of the cerebrum by the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is composed of grey and white sub- stance, the former occupying the surface, the latter the interior, and its surface is formed of parallel lamellae separated by sulci, and here and there by deeper sulci. In form, the cerebellum is oblong and flatten- ed, its greater diameter being from side to side, its two surfaces look- ing upwards and downwards, and its borders being anterior, posterior, and lateral. In consideration of its shape the cerebellum admits of a division into two hemispheres, into certain prominences termed pro-424 CKRE11ELI.UM. cesses and lobules, and into certain divisions of its substance called lobes, formed upon the hemispheres by the deeper sulci above referred to. The two hemispheres are separated from each other on the upper surface of the cerebellum by a longitudinal ridge which is termed the superior vermiform process and which forms a commissure be- tween them. On the anterior border of the organ there is a semi- lunar notch, incisura cerebelli anterior, which encircles the corpora quadrigemina posteriorly. On the posterior border there is another notch, incisura cerebelli postenor, which receives the upper part of the falx cerebelli; and on the under surface of the cerebellum is a deep fissure corresponding with the medulla oblongata, and termed the valle- cula (valley). Each hemisphere of the cerebellum is divided by means of a fissure (sulcus horizontalis) which runs along its free border, into an upper and a lower portion, and upon each of these portions certain lobes are marked out. Thus on the upper portion there are two such lobes se- parated by a sulcus, somewhat more strongly marked than the rest, and extending deeper into the substance of the cerebellum; they are the lohus superior anterior and lobus superior posterior. Upon the under portion of the hemisphere there are three such lobes, namely, lobus inferior anterior, medius, and posterior, and two additional ones of peculiar form, the lobus inferior intemus or to7isil, and flocctdus. The tonsil (amygdala) is situated on the side of the vallecula, and projects into the fourth ventricle. The flocculus or pneumogastric lobule, long and slender, extends from the side of the vallecula around the corpus restiforme to the crus cerebelli, lying behind the filaments of the eighth pair of nerves. The commissiu’e between the two hemispheres is termed the worm (vermis), that portion of the worm which occupies the upper surface of the cerebellum as far back as the horizontal fissure being the processus vermiformis superior, and that which is lodged within the vallecula being the processus vermiformis inferior. The superior vermiform process is a prominent longitudinal ridge, extending from the incisura anterior to the incisura posterior cerebelli. In imitation of the hemi- spheres, it is divided into lobes, of which three have received names, namely, the lobulus centralis, which is a small lobe situated in the in- cisura anterior ; the inonticulus cerebelli, a longer lobe, having its peak and declivity ; and a small lobe near the incisura posterior, the com- tnissum simplex. The lobes of the inferior vermiform process are four in number, namely,—the commissura brevis, situated in the incisura posterior, below the horizontal fissure; pyramid, a small, obtusely- pointed eminence ; a larger prominence, the uvula, situated between tbe tonsils, and connected with them by means of a commissure; and in front of the uvula, the nodulus. In front of the nodulus is a thin lamina of medullary substance, consisting of a central and ttvo lateral portions, tbe velum medullare posterius (valvula Tarini), and between this velum in front, and the nodulus and u^la behind, is a deep fossa which is known as the stcallow's nest (nidus hirundinis). The velumBASE OF THE BRAIN. 425 ineduUare anterius is the valve of Vieussens, described with the fourth ventricle ; both these vela proceed from the same point in the roof of that ventricle, and separate from each other at an angle, the one pass- ing obliquely forwards, the other obliquely backwards. W'hen a vertical incision is made into the'cerebellum, that appear- ance is seen which has been denominated arbor vitcB cerehelli; the white substance in the centre of such a section resembles the trunk of a tree, from which branches are given off, and from the branches branchlets and leaves, the two latter being coated by a moderately thick and uniform layer of grey substance. If the incision be made somewhat nearer the commissure than to the lateral border of the organ, a yellowish grey dentated line, enclosing medullary substance traversed by the openings of numerous vessels, will be seen in the centre of the white substance. This is the ganglion of the cerebellum, the corpus rhomboideum or dentatum, from which the peduncles of the cerebellum proceed. The grey line is dense and homy in structure, and is the cut edge of a thin capsule, open towards the medulla ob- longata. The cerebellum is associated with the rest of the encephalon by means of three pairs of rounded cords or peduncles, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior peduncles, oi processus e cerebello ad testes, proceed from the cerebellum forwards and upwards to the testes, in which they are lost. They form the anterior part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle, and give attachment by their inner borders to the valve of Vieussens, which is stretched between them. At their junction with the testes they are crossed by the fourth pair of nerves. The middle peduncles, or crura cerebelli ad pontem, the Largest of the three, issue from the cerebellum through the anterior extremity of the sulcus horizontalis, and are lost in the pons Varolii. The inferior peduncles, or crura ad meduUam dblongatam, are the corpora restiformia which descend to the posterior part of the medulla oblongata, and form the inferior portion of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. BASE OF THE BRAIN. The student should now prepare to study the base of the brain ; for this purpose the organ should be turned upon its incised surface ; and if the dissection have hitlierto been conducted with care, he will find the base perfectly uninjured. The arachnoid membrane, some parts of the pia mater, and the circle of Willis, must be carefully cleared away, in order to expose all the parts to be examined. These he will find arranged in the following order from before backwards:— Longitudinal fissure, Olfactory nerves, Fissure of Sylvius, Substantia perforata,BASE OF THE BRAIN. 42G Commencement of the transverse fissure, Optic commissure, Tuber cinereum, Infundibulum, Corpora albicantia. Locus perforatus. Crura cerebri. Pons Varolii, Crura cerebelli. Medulla oblongata. The Longitudinal fissure is the space separating the two hemi- spheres : it is continued downwards to the base of the brain, and divides the two anterior lobes. In this fissure the anterior cerebral arteries ascend towards the corpus callosum ; and, if the two lobes be slightly drawn asunder, the anterior border (genu) of the corpus cal- losum will be seen descending to the base of the brain. Arrived at the base of the brain, the corpus callosum terminates by a concave border, which is prolonged to the commissure of the optic nerves by a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. The lamina cinerea is the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle. On each side of the lamina cinerea the corpus callosum is continued into the substantia perforata and crura cerebri, and upon tbe latter forms a narrow medullary band lying externally to, and slightly over- lapping the optic tract, the medulla innominata. Upon the under surface of each anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, is the olfactory nerve, with its bulb. The Fissure of Sylvius bounds the anterior lobe posteriorly, and separates it from the middle lobe; it lodges the middle cerebral artery. If this fissure be followed outwards, a small isolated cluster of five or six convolutions will be observed ; these constitute the island of Reil. The island of Reil, together with the substantia perforata, form the base of the corpus striatum. The Substantia perforata is a triangular plane of white substance, situated at the inner extremity of the fissure of S3’’lvius. It is named perforata from being pierced by a number of openings for small arte- ries, which enter the brain in this situation to supply the grey sub- stance of the corpus striatum. Passing backwards on each side beneath the edge of the middle lobe, is the commencement of the great transverse fissure, which ex- tends beneath the hemisphere of one side to the same point on the opposite side. A probe passed into this fissure between the crus cerebri and middle lobe would enter the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle. The Optic commissure is situated on the middle line; it is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The Tuber cinereum is an eminence of grey substance situated im- mediately behind the optic commissure, and in front of the corpora427 BASE OP THE BRAIN. niammillaria. From its centre there projects a small conical body of grey substance, apparently a prolongation of the tuber cinereum, the infurulibulum. The infundibulum is hollow in its interior, enclosing a short coecal canal, which communicates with the cavity of the third ventricle ; and below the termination of the canal, the conical process becomes connected with the pituitary gland. The infundibulum and tuber cinereum form part of the floor of the third ventricle. The Pituitary glatid (hypophysis cerebri), is a small, flattened, red- dish-grey body situated in the sella turcica, and closely retained in that situation by the dura mater and arachnoid. It consists of two lobes, closely pressed together, the anterior lobe being the larger of the two, and oblong in shape, the posterior round. Both lobes are connected with the infundibulum, but the latter is so soft in texture as to be generally torn through in the removal of the brain. Indeed, for the purposes of the student, it is better to effect this separation ■with the knife, and leave the pituitary body in situ, to be examined ■with the base of the cranium. The Corpora albicantia (mammillaria, pisiformia, bulbi fornicis) are two white convex bodies, having the shape and size of peas, situated behind the tuber cinereum, and between the crura cerebri. They are a part of the crura of the fornix, which, after their origin from the thalami optici, descend to the base of the brain, and making a sudden curve upon themselves previously to their ascent to the lateral ventri- cles, constitute the corpora albicantia. When divided by section, these bodies wiU be found to be composed of a capsule of white sub- stance, containing grey matter, the grey matter of the two corpora being connected by means of a commissure. The Locus perforatus is a layer of whitish-grey substance, connected in front with the corpora albicantia, behind with the pons Varolii, and on each side with the crura cerebri, between which it is situated. It is perforated by several thick tufts of arteries, which are distributed to the thalami optici and third ventricle, of which latter it assists in forming the floor. It is sometimes called the pons Tarini. The Crura cerebri are two thick white cords, which issue from the anterior border of the pons Varolii, and diverge to each side to enter the thalami optici. By their outer side the crura cerebri are conti- nuous with the corpora quadrigemina, and, above, they constitute the lower boundary of the aqueduct of Sylvius. In their interior they contain grey matter, which has a semilunar shape when the crus is divided transversely, and has been termed the locus niger. The third nerve will be observed to arise from the inner side of each, and the ■ fourth nerves wind around their outer border from above. The Pons Varolii* (protuberantia anmdaris, nodus encephali), is * Constant Varolins, Professor of Anatomy in Bologna: died in 1578. He dissected the brain in the course of its fibres, beginning from the medulla ob- longata ; a plan which has since been perfected by ■yieussens, and by Gall and ' Spurzheim.

There is a groove along its middle which lodges the basilar artery. The pons Varolii is the com- missure of the cerebellum, and associates tbe two lateral lobes in their common function. Resting against the pons, near its posterior border, is the sixth pair of nerves. On the anterior border of the crus cere- belli, at each side, is the thick bundle of filaments belonging. to the fifth nerve, and, Ij'ing against its posterior border, the seventh pair of nerves. The upper surface of the pons forms a part of the floor of the foiu^h ventricle. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata (bulbus rhachidicus), is the upper enlarged portion of the spinal cord. It is somewhat conical in shape, and a little more than an inch in length, extending from the pons Varolii to a point corresponding with the upper border of the atlas. On the middle fine, in front and behind, the medulla oblongata is marked by two vertical fissures, the fissura longitudinalis anterior and posterior, which divide it superficially into two symmetrical lateral cords or co- lumns ; whilst each lateral column is subdivided by minor grooves into three smaller cords, namely, the corpora pyramidalia, corpora olivaria, and corpora restiformia. The Corpora pyramidalia are two narrow convex cords, tapering slightly from above downwards, and situated one on either side of the fissura longitudinalis anterior. At about an inch below the pons the corpora pyramidalia communicate very freely across the fissure by a decussation of their fibres, and at their point of entrance into the pons they are constricted into roimd cords. The fissura longitudinalis is somewhat enlarged by this constriction, and the enlarged space has re- ceived the name of foramen caecum of the medulla oblongata. The Corpora olivaria (named from some resemblance to the shape of an olive), are two oblong, oval-shaped, convex bodies, of about the same breadth with the corpora pyramidalia, about half an inch in length, and somewhat larger above than below. The corpus olivare is situated immediately external to the corpus pyramidale, from which, and from the corpus restiforme, it is separated by a well-marked groove. In this groove some longitudinal fibres are seen which enclose the base of the corpus olivare, and have been named funiculi siliquce, those which lie to its inner side being the funiculus intemus, and those to its outer side the funiculus externus. Besides these there are other fibres which cross the corpus olivare obliquely, these* are the fibres ar- ciformes- When examined by section (Fig. 146), the coi-pus olivare is found to be a ganglion deeply embedded in the medulla oblongata, and meeting its fellow at the middle line behind the corpus pyramidale. The ganglion of the corpus olivare (corpus dentatum, nucleus olivse), like that of the cerebellum, is a yellowish-grey dentated capsule, open behind, and containing medullary substance from which a fasciculusFIIIRES OF TilE BRAIN. 430 of fibres proceeds upwards to the corpora quadrigemina and thalami optici. The nervous filaments which spring from the groove on the anterior border of the corpus olivare,are those of the hypoglossal nerve; and those on its posterior border are the glosso-pharyngeal and pneu- mogastric. The Corpora restiformia (restis, a rope), comprehend the whole of the posterior half of each lateral column of the medulla oblongata. They are separated from the corpora olivaria by the grooves already spoken of; posteriorly they are divided from each other by the fissura longitudinalis posterior and by the fourth ventricle, and superiorly they diverge and curve backwards to enter the cerebellum, and constitute its inferior peduncles. Along the posterior border of each corpus res- tiforme, and marked oflf from that body by a groove, is a narrow white cord, separated from its fellow by the fissura longitudinalis posterior. This pair of narrow cords are termed the posterior median columns or fasciculi (funiculi graciles). Each fasciculus forms an enlargement (processus clavatus) at its upper end, and is then lost in the corre- sponding corpus restiforme. The processus clavati are the lateral boundaries of the nib of the calamus scriptorius. The corpus resti- forme is crossed near its entrance into the cerebellum, by the auditory nerve, the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and the pneumogas- tric lobule. The remaining portion of the medulla oblongata visible from the exterior, are the two slightly convex columns which enter into the for- mation of the floor of the fourth ventricle. These columns are the funiculi teretes or posterior pyramids. Diverging fibres.—The fibres composing the columns of the me- dulla oblongata have a special arrangement on reaching the upper part of that body, those of the corpora pyrauiidalia and olivaria enter the pons Varolii, and are thence prolonged through the crura cerebri, tha- lami optici, and corpora striata to the cerebral hemispheres; hut those of the corpora restiformia are reflected backwards into the cerebellum and form its inferior peduncles. From pursuing this course, and spreading out as they advance, these fibres have been termed by Gall the diverging fibres. While situated within the pons the fibres of the corpus pyramidale and olivare separate and spread out, and have grey substance interposed between them; and they quit the pons much increased in number and bulk, so as to form the crus cerebri. The fibres of the crus cerebri again are separated in the thalamus opticus, and are intermingled wdth grey matter, and they also quit that body greatly increased in number and bulk. Precisely the same change takes place in the corpus stria- tum, and the fibres are now so extraordinarily multiplied as to be capable of forming a large proportion of the hemispheres. Observing this remarkable increase in the white fibres, apparently from the admixture of grey substance. Gall and Spurzheim considered the latter as the material of increase or formative substance to the white fibres, and they are borne out in this conclusion by several431 diverging fibres. collateral facts, among the most prominent of which is the great vascu- larity of the grey substance; and the larger proportion of the nutrient fluid circulating through it is fully capable of effecting the increased growth and nutrition of the structures by which it is surrounded.

The opposite hemisphere of the cerebellum.FIBRES OF THE BRAIN. 432 For a like reason the bodies in which this grey substance occurs, are called by the same physiologists ’‘'‘ganglia of increasef and by other authors simply ganglia. Thus the thalami optici and corpora striata are the ganglia of the cerebrum; or, in other words, tlie fornudirie ganglia of the hemispheres. The fibres of the corpora pyramidalia are not all of them destined to the course above described; several fasciculi curve outwards to reach the corpora restiformia, some passing in front and some behind the corpus olivare on each side. These are the arcifarm fibres, and they are distinguished by Mr. Solly'into the superjkial and deep cere- bellar fibres. In the pons Varolii the continued or cerebral fibres (Solly) of the corpus pyramidale are placed between the superficial and deep layers of transverse fibres, and escaping from the pons, con- stitute the inferior and inner segment of the crus cerebri. From the crus cerebri they pass for the most part beneath the thalami optici into the corpora striata. The fibres which enclose the corpus olivare, under the name of fasciculi siliquse, are separated by that body into two bands ; the innermost of the two bands, funiculus siliqucB internus, accompanies the fibres of the corpus pyramidale into the crus cerebri. The funicrdus siliquce externus unites with a fasciculus proceeding from the nucleus olivse, and the combined column ascending behind the crus cerebelli divides into a superior and an inferior band. The inferior band proceeds with a fasciculus presently to be described, the fasciculus innominatus, into the upper segment of the crus cerebri. The supe- rior band (laqueus) ascends by the side of the processus e cerebello ad testes, and, crossing the latter obliquely, enters the corpora quadrige- mina, in which many of its fibres are distributed, while the rest are continued onwards into the thalamus opticus. The corpora restiformia derive their fibres from the anterior as weU as from the posterior columns of the medulla oblongata ; they diverge as they approach the cerebellum, and leaving behind them the cavity of the fourth ventricle, enter the substance of the cerebellum, under the form of two rounded cords. These cords envelope the corpora rhomboidea, or ganglia of increase, and then expand on all sides so as to constitute the cerebellum. Besides the fibres here described, there are, in the interior of the medulla oblongata, behind the corpora olivaria and more or less appa- rent between these bodies and the corpora restiformia, two large bun- dles of fibres, ihe fasciculi innominati. These fascicub ascend behind the deep transverse fibres of the pons Varobi, and become apparent in the floor of the fourth ventricle, under the name of fascicub teretes, or posterior pyramids. From this point they are prolonged upwards beneath the corpora quadrigemina into the crura cerebri, of which they form the upper and outer segment, and are thence continued through the thalami optici and corpora striata into the hemispheres. The locus niger of the crus cerebri is a septum of grey matter interposed between these fasciculi and those of the corpora pyramidalia. ,CONVERGING FIBRES. 433 Converging fibres.—In addition to the diverging fibres which are tlius shown to constitute both the cerebrum and cerebellum, by their increase and development, another set of fibres are found to exist, which have for their office the association of the symmetrical halves and distant parts of the same hemispheres. These are called from their direction converging fibres, and from their office commissures. The commissures of the cerebrum and cerebellum are the— Corpus callosum. Fornix, Septum lucidum. Anterior commissure. Middle commissure. Posterior commissure, Peduncles of the pineal gland, Pons Varolii. The Corpus callosum is the commissure of the hemispheres. It is therefore of moderate thickness in the middle, where its fibres pass directly from one hemisphere to the other ; thicker in front (genu), where the anterior lobes are connected ; and thickest behind (sple- nium), where the fibres from the posterior lobes are assembled. The fibres which curve backwards into the posterior lobes from the sple- nium of the corpus callosum have been termed forceps, those which pass directly outwards into the middle lobes from the same point, tapetum, and those which curve forwards and inwards from the genu to the anterior lobes, forceps anterior. The Fornix is an antero-posterior commissure, and serves to connect a number of parts. Below, it is associated with the thalami optici; on each side, by means of the corpora fimbriata, with the middle lobes of the brain; and, above, with the corpus callosum, and consequently with the hemispheres. The Upturn lucidum is a perpendicular commissure between the fornix and corpus callosum. The Anterior commissure traverses the corpus striatum, and con- nects the anterior and middle lobes of opposite hemispheres. The Middle commissure is a layer of grey substance, uniting the thalami optici. The Posterior commissure is a white rounded cord, connecting the thalami optici. ®ie Peduncles of the pineal gland must also be regarded as com- missures, assisted in their function by the grey substance of the gland. The Pons Varolii is the commissure to the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. It consists of transverse fibres, which are split into two layers by the passage of the fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia and corpora olivaria. These two layers, the superior and inferior, are collected together on each side, in the formation of the crura cerebelli. F F434 SPINAL CORD, SPINAL CORD. The dissection of the spinal cord requires that the spinal column should be opened throughout its entire length by sawing through the laininse of the vertebrae, close to the roots of the transverse processes, and raising the arches with a chisel ; the muscles of the back having been removed as a preliminary step. The Spinal column contains the spinal cord, or medulla spinalis; the roots of the spinal nerves; and the membranes of the cord, viz. the dura mater, arachnoid, pia mater, and memhrana dentuta. The Dura mater spinalis {tli£ca vertehralis) is a cylindrical sheath of fibrous membrane, identical in structure with the dura m.ater of the skull, and continuous with that membrane. At the margin of the occipital foramen it is closely adherent to the bone ; by its anterior surface it is attached to the posterior common ligament, and below, bv means of its pointed extremity, to the coccyx. In the rest of its extent it is comparatively free, being connected, bj' a very loose areolar tissue only, to the walls of the spinal canal. In this areolar tissue there exists a quantity of reddish, oily, adipose substance, somewhat analogous to the marrow of long bones. On either side and below, the dura mater forms a sheath for each of the spinal nerves, to which it is closely adherent. Upon its inner surface it is smooth, being lined by the arachnoid ; and on its sides maj^ be seen double openings for the two roots of each of the spinal nerves. The Arachnoid is a continuation of the serous membrane of the brain. It encloses the cord very loosely, being connected to it only by long slender filaments* of areolar tissue, and by a longitudinal lamella which is attached to the posterior aspect of the cord. The areolar tissue is most abundant in the cervical region, and diminishes in quan- tity from above downwards ; and the longitudinal lamella is complete only in the dorsal region. The arachnoid passes off from the cord on either side with the spinal nerves, to which it forms a sheath ; and is then reflected on the dura mater, to constitute its serous surface. A connection exists in several situations between the arachnoid of the cord and that of the dura mater. The space between the arachnoid and the spinal cord is identical with that already described as existing between the same parts in the brain, the sub-arachnoidean space. It is occupied by a serous fluid, sufficient in quantity to ex- pand the arachnoid, and fill completely the cavity of the theca verte- bralis. The sub-arachnoidean fluid keeps up a constant and gentle pressure on the entire surface of the brain and spinal cord, and yields with the greatest facility to the various movements of the cord, giving to those delicate structures the advantage of the principles so usefully applied by Dr. Arnott in the hj^drostatic bed. • According to Mr. Rainey these filaments are nervous fasciculi liaving their origin in the arachnoid, and passing to the arteries of tlie cord. See page 411.435 SPINAL CORD. The Pia mater is the immediate investment of the cord ; and, like the other membranes, is continuous with that of the brain. It is not, however, like the pia mater cerebri, a vascular membrane ; but is dense and fibrous in structure, and contains but few vessels. It invests the cord closely, and sends a duplicature into the fissura longitudinalis anterior, and another, extremely delicate, into the fissura longitudinalis posterior. It forms a sheath for each of the filaments of the nerves, and for the nerves themselves; and, inferiorly, at the conical termina- tion of the cord, is prolonged downwards as a slender ligament {filuni termmule), which descends through the centre of the cauda equina, and is attached to the dura mater lining the canal of the coccyx. This attachment is a rudiment of the original extension of the spinal cord into the canal of the sacrum and coccyx. The pia mater has, distributed to it, a number of nervous plexuses derived from the sym- pathetic. The Membrana dentata (ligamentum dentatum) is a thin process of pia mater sent oif from each side of the cord throughout its entire length, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The number of serrations on each side is about twenty, the first being situated on a level with the occipital foramen, and having the vertebral artery and hypoglossal nerve passing in front and the spinal accessory nerve behind it, and the last opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra. Below this point, the membrana dentata is lost in the filum temiinale of the pia mater. The use of this mem- brane is to maintain the position of the spinal cord in the midst of the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Spinal cord of the adult extends from the pons Varolii to op- posite the first or second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a rounded point; in the child, at birth, it reaches to the middle of the third lumbar vertebra, and in the embryo is prolonged as far as the coccyx. It presents a difference of diameter in different parts of its extent, and exhibits three enlargements. The uppermost of these is the medidla oblongata; the next corresponds with the origin of the nerves destined to the upper extremities ; and the lower eidargement is situated near its termination, and corresponds with the attach- ment of the nerves which are intended for the supply of the lower limb. In form, the spinal cord is a flattened cylinder, and presents on its anterior surfece a fissure, which extends into the cord to the depth of one-third of its diameter. This is the fissura longitudinalis anterior. If the sides of the fissure be gently separated, they will be seen to be connected at the bottom by a layer of medullary substance, the aiite- I: rior commissure. On the posterior surface another fissure exists, which is so narrow between the second cervical and second lumbar nerve, as to be hardly perceptible. This is the fissura longitudinalis posterior. It extends ■ more deeply into the cord than the anterior fissure, and terminates in . the grey substance of the interior. These two fissures divide the me-436 SPINAL CORD. dulla spinalis into two lateral cords, which are connected to each other by the white commissure which forms the bottom of the anterior lon- gitudinal fissure, and by a commissure of grey matter situated behind the former. On either side of the fissura longitudinalis posterior is a slight line which bounds on each side the posterior median columns. These columns are most apparent at the upper part of the cord, near the fourth ventricle, where they are separated by the point of the calamus scriptorius, and where they form the bulbous enlargement at each side, called processus clavatus. Two other lines are observed on the medulla, the anterior and pos- terior lateral sulci, corresponding with the attachment of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior lateral sulcus is a mere trace, marked only by the attachment of the filaments of the anterior roots. The posterior lateral sulcus is more evident, and is a narrow greyish line derived from the grey substance of the interior. Although these fissures and sulci indicate a division of the spinal cord into three pairs of columns, namely, anterior, lateral, and poste- rior, the posterior median columns being regarded as a part of the posterior columns, it is customary to consider each half of the spinal cord as consisting of two columns only, the antero-lateral and the posterior. The antero-lateral columns are the columns of motion, and comprehend all that part of the cord situated between the fissura longitudinalis anterior and the posterior lateral sulcus, the grey line of origin of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The posterior columns are the columns of sensation. If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, its internal struc- ture may be seen and examined. It will then appear to be composed of two hollow cylinders of white matter, placed side by side, and con- nected by a narrow white commissure. Each cylinder is filled with grey substance, which is connected by a commissure of the same Fig. 146.* A B * Sections of the spinal cord. After Arnold. A.

The extremities of the curved lines correspond with the sulci of origin of the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves. The anterior extremities, larger than the posterior, do not quite reach this surface; but the pos- terior appear upon the surface, and form a narrow grey line, the sulcus lateralis posterior. The white substance of the spinal cord is composed of parallel fibres which are collected into longitudinal laminm and extend throughout the entire length of the cord. These laminae are various in breadth, and are arranged in a radiated manner; one. border being thick and corresponding with the surface of the cord, while the other is thin and lies in contact with the grey substance of the interior. According to Rolando the white substance constitutes a simple nervous membrane, which is folded into longitudinal plaits, having the radiated disposition above described. The anterior commissure, according to his description, is merely the continuation of this nervous membrane from one lateral cord across the middle line to the other. Moreover, Rolando considers that a thin lamina of pia mater is received between each of the folds fi'om the exterior, while a layer of the grey substance is prolonged be- tween them from within. Cruveilhier is of opinion that each lamella is completely independent of its neighbours, and he believes this state- ment to be confirmed by pathology, which shows that a single lamella may be injured or atrophied, and at the same time be surrounded by others perfectly sound. CRANIAL NERVES. There are nine pairs of cranial nerves. Taken in their order from before, backwards, they are as follows :— 1st. Olfactory. 2nd. Optic. 3rd. Motores oculorum. 4th.

In consonance with this view he termed them respiratory 7/e>TCt(, and he ga^e to that pai't of the medulla oblongata from which they arise the name of respiratory tract. First pair. Olfactory.—The olfactory nerve arises by three roots ; an inner root from the substantia perforata, a middle root from a papilla of grey matter (caruncula mamillaris), embedded in the anterior lobe, and an external root, which may be traced as a white streak along the fissure of Sylvius into the corpus striatum, where it is continuous with some of the fibres of the anterior commissure. The nen'ous cord formed by the union of these three roots is soft in texture, prismoid in shape, and embedded in a sulcus between two convolutions on the under surface of each anterior lobe of the brain, lying between the pia mater and the arachnoid. As it passes for- wards it increases in breadth and swells at its extremity into an oblong mass of grey and white substance, the hidhus ofactorkis, which rests upon the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone. From the under surface of the bulbus olfactorius are given off the nerves which pass through the cribriform foramina and supply the mucous mem- brane of the nares; they are arranged into two groups, an inner group, reddish in colour and soft, which spread out upon the septum narium, and an outer group, whiter and more firm, which descend through bony canals in the outer wall of the nares, and are distri- buted upon the superior and middle turbinated bones. Second pair. Optic.—The optic nerve, a nerve of large size, arises from the corpora geniculata on the posterior and inferior aspect of the thalamus opticus and from the nates. Proceeding from this origin it winds around the crus cerebri as a flattened band, under the name of tractus opticus, and joins with its fellow in front of the tuber cinereum to form the optic commissure (chiasma). The tractus opticus is united with the crus cerebri and tuber cinereum, and is covered in by the pia mater; the commissure is also connected with the tuber cinereum, from which it receives fibres, and the nerve bej'ond the nasal bone. 3.

In passing through the optic foramen the optic nerve receives a sheath from the dura mater, which splits at this point into two layers ; one, which becomes the periosteum of the orbit; the other, the one in question, which forms a sheath for the nerve, and is lost in the sclerotic coat of the eyeball.

PATHETICI. 441 After a short course within the orbit the optic nerve pierces the sclero- tic and choroid coats and expands into the nervous membrane of the eyeball, the retina. Near the globe, the nerve is pierced by a small artery, the arteria centralis retinm, which runs through the central axis of the nerve and reaches the internal surface of the retina, to which it distributes branches. The commissure rests upon the processus olivaris of the sphenoid bone ; it is bounded by the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum in front, by the substantia perforata on each side, and by the tuber cinereum behind. Within the commissure the innermost fibres of the optic nerves cross each other to pass to opposite eyes, while the outer fibres continue their course uninterruptedly to the eye of the corre- sponding side. The neurilemma of the commissure, as well as that of the nerves, is formed by the pia mater. Third pair. Motores Oculorum.—The motor oculi, a nerve of moderate size, arises from the inner side of the crus cerebri, close to the pons Varolii, and passes forward between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar artery. It pierces the dura mater immediately in front of the posterior clinoid process ; descends obliquely along the ex- ternal wall of the cavernous sinus; and divides into two branches which enter the orbit between the two heads of the external rectus muscle. The superior branch ascends, and supplies the superior rectus and le- vator palpebrae. The inferior sends a branch beneath the optic nerve to the internal rectus, another to the inferior rectus, and a long branch to the inferior oblique muscle. From the latter a short thick branch is given off to the ciliary ganglion, forming its inferior root. The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced into the grey sub- stance of the crus cerebri,* into the motor tract,+ and as far as the superior fibres of the crus cerebri. J In the cavernous sinus it receives one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus, and one from the ophthalmic nerve. Fourth pair. Pathetici (trochlearis).—The fourth is the smallest cerebral nerve; it ai’ises from the valve of Vieussens close to the testis, and winding around the crus cerebri to the extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, pierces the dura mater near the oval opening for the fifth nerve, and passes along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus to the sphenoidal fissure. In its course through the sinus it is situated at first below the motor oculi, but afterwards ascends and becomes the highest of the nerves which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. Upon entering the orbit the nerve crosses the levator palpebrae muscle near its origin, and is distributed upon the orbital surface of the superior oblique or trochlearis muscle ; hence its synonym trochlearis. Branches,—While in the cavernous sinus the fourth nerve gives off Mayo. t SoUy. t Grainger.44'2 FIFTH FAIR OF NER\'KS, a recurrent branch, some filaments of communication to the ophthalmic nerve, and a branch to assist in forming the lachr\’mal nerve ; the recurrent braiich, which consists of sympathetic filaments derived from the carotid plexus, passes backwards between the layers of the tento- rium, and divides into two or three filaments, which are distributed to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. This recurrent nerve is some- times a branch of the ophthalmic, and occasionally proceeds directly from the carotid plexus. Fifth pair. Trifaciat (trigeminus).—The fifth nerve, the great sensitive nerve of the head and face, and the largest cranial nerve, is analogous to the spinal nerves in its origin by two roots, from the an- terior and posterior columns of the spinal cord, and in the existence of a ganglion on the posterior root. It arises* from a tract of yellowish- white matter situated in front of the floor of the fourth ventricle and the origin of the auditory nerve, and behind the crus cerebelli. This tract divides inferiorly into two fasciculi which may be traced down- wards into the spinal cord, one being continuous ivith tbe fibres of the anterior column, the other with the posterior column. Proceeding from this origin the two roots of the nerve pass forward, and issue from the brain upon the anterior part of the crus cerebelli, where they are sepa- rated by a slight interval. The anterior is much smaller than the pos- terior, and the two together constitute the fifth nerve, which, in this situation, consists of seventy to a hundred filaments held together by pia mater. The nerve then passes through an oval opening in the bor- der of the tentorium, near the extremity of the petrous bone, and spreads out into a large semilunar ganglion, the Gasserian. If the ganglion be turned over, it will be seen that the anterior root lies against its under surface without ha^fing any connection with it, and may be followed onwards to the inferior maxillary nerve. The Gasse- rian ganglion divides into three branches, the ophthalmic, superior maxillarj', and inferior maxillary. The Ophthalmic nerve is a short trunk, being not more than three quarters of an inch in length ; it arises from the upper angle of the Gasserian ganglion, beneath the dura mater, and passes forwards through the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, Ij'ing externally to the other nerves ; it divides into three branches. Previously to its dmsion it receives several filaments from the carotid plexus, and gives off a small recurrent nerve, that passes backwards with the recurrent branch of the fourth nerve between the two layers of the tentorium to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. The Branches of the ophthalmic nerve are, the— Frontal, Lachr3Tnal, Nasal. * I have adopted the origin of this nerve, given by Dr. Alcoek, of Dublin, in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, as the result of his dissections. Mr. Mayo also traces the anterior root of the nerve to a similar origin.OPTHALMIC NERVE. 443 The Frontal nerve mounts above the levator palpebrae, and runs forward, resting on that muscle, to the supra-orbital loramen, through which it escapes upon the forehead, with the supra-orbital artery. It supplies the conjunctiva and upper eyelid and the integument oi the cranium as far as the vertex. Fig. 149.* * A diagram, shewing the fifth pair of nerves with its branches. 1.

The frontal nerve gives off but one small branch, the supra-irocldeur, which passes inwards above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and ascends along the middle line of the forehead, distributing fila- ments to the integument, to the inner angle of the eye and root of the nose, and to the conjunctiva. The Lachrymal nerve, the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic, receives a filament from the fourth nerve in the cavernous sinus, and passes outwards along the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and in company with the lachrymal artery, to the lachrymal gland, where it divides ifito two branches. The superior branch passes along the upper surface of the gland and through a foramen in the malar bone, and is distributed upon the temple and cheek, communicating with the subcutaneus malse and facial nerves. The inferior branch supplies the lower surface of the gland and con- junctiva, and terminates in the integument of the upper lid commu- nicating with the facial nerve. The nerve (naso-ciliaris) passes forwards between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, crosses the optic nerve in com- pany with the ophthalmic artery, and enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen immediately above the internal rectus. It then traverses the upper part of the ethmoid bone to the cribriform plate, and passes downwards through the slit-like opening by the side of the crista galli into the nose, where it divides into two branches—an internal branch supplying the mucous membrane near the anterior openings of the nares; and an external branch which passes between the fibro-car- tilages, and is distributed to the integument at the extremity of the nose. The Branches of the nasal nerve within the orbit are, the gangli- onic, ciliary, and infra-trochlear; in the nose it gives off one or two filaments to the anterior ethmoidal cells and frontal sinus. The ganglionic branch passes obliquely forwards to the superior angle of the ciliary ganglion, forming its superior or long root. The ciliary branches are two or three filaments which are given off by the nasal as it crosses the optic nerve. They pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and pass between that tunic and the choroid to be distributed to the iris. The infra-trochlear is given off just as the ner^•e is about to enter the anterior ethmoidal foramen. It passes along the superior border of the internal rectus to the inner angle of the e}’e, where it communicates with the supra-trochlear nerve, and supplies the lachry- mal sac, caruncula lachrymalis, conjunctiva, and inner angle of the orbit. The Superior maxillary nerve, larger than the preceding, proceeds from the middle of the Gasserian ganglion; it passes forwards through the foramen rotundum, crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enters the canal in the floor of the orbit, along which it runs to the infra-orbital foramen. Emerging on the face, beneath the levator labii superioris muscle, it divides into a number of branches, which are dis-445 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. tributed to the lower eyelid and conjunctiva, and to the muscles and integument of the upper lip, nose, and cheek, fonning a plexus with the facial nerve. The Branches of the superior maxillary nerve are divisible into three groups;—1. Those which are given off in the spheno-maxillar)’- fossa. 2. Those in the infra-orbital canal; and 3. Those on the face. They may be thus arranged ;— Splteno-maxilla ryfossa, Infra-orhital canal. On the face, Orbital, Two from Meckel’s ganglion, Posterior dental. Middle dental. Anterior dental. Muscular, Cutaneous. The Orbital branch (n. subcutaneus malae) enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two branches, temporal and malar; the temporal branch ascends along the outer wall of the orbit, and, after receiving a branch from the lachrymal nerve, passes through a canal in the malar bone and enters the temporal fossa; it then pierces the temporal muscle and fascia and is distributed to the integument of the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and anterior auricular nerve. In the temporal fossa it com- municates with the deep temporal nerves. The malar, or inferior branch, takes its course along the lower angle of the outer wall of the orbit, and emerges upon the cheek through an opening in the malar bone, passing between the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. It communicates with branches of the infra-orbital and facial nerves. The Tivo branches from Meckel’s ganglion ascend from that body to join the nerve, as it crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa. The Posterior dental branches pass through small foramina, in the posterior surface of the superior maxillary bone, and running forwards in the base of the alveolus, supply the posterior teeth and gums. The Middle and anterior dental branches descend to the correspond- ing teeth and gums ; the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. Previously to their distribution, the dental nerves form a plexus (supe- rior maxillarj' plexus) in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone immediately above the alveolus. From this plexus the filaments are given off which supply the pulps of the teeth, the gums, the mucous membrane of the floor of the nares, and the palate. Some gangliform masses have been described in connection with this plexus, one being placed over the canine, and another over the second molar tooth. The Muscular and cutaneous branches are the terminating filaments of the nerve; they supply the muscles, integument, and raucous mem- brane of the cheek, nose, and lip, and form an intricate plexus with branches of the facial nerve.INl’ERIOR MAXILLARY NERV'E. 44G The Inferior maxillary nerve proceeds from the inferior an'^le of the Gasserian ganglion; it is the largest of the three disdsions of the fifth nerve, and is augmented in size by the anterior or motor root, which passes behind the ganglion, and unites with the inferior maxillary as it escapes through the foramen ovale. Emerging at the foramen, ovale the nerve divides into two trunks, external and in- ternal, which are separated from each other by the external pterygoid muscle. The External trunks into which .may be traced nearly the whole of the motor root, immediately divides into five branches which are dis- tributed to the muscles of the temporo-maxillarj’' region; they are— The Masseteric, which crosses the sigmoid notch ^vith the masseteric artery to the masseter muscle. It sends a small branch to the tem- poral muscle, and a filament to the temporo-maxillary articulation. Temporal; two branches passing between the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle and the temporal bone to the temporal muscle. Two or three filaments from these nerves pierce the temporal fascia, and communicate with the lachrymal, subcutaneus malae, auri- cular and facial nerve. Buccal; a large branch which pierces the fibres of the external pterygoid, to reach the buccinator muscle. This nerve sends fila- ments to the temporal and external pterygoid muscle, to the mucous membrane and integument of the cheek, and communicates with the facial nerve. Internal pterygoid; a long and slender branch, which passes inwards to the internal pteiygoid muscle, and gives filaments in its course to the tensor palati and tensor tympani. This nerve is remarkable from its connection with the otic ganglion, to which it is closely at- tached. The Internal trunk divides into three branches— Gustatory, Inferior dental, Anterior auricular. The Gustatory nerve descends between the two pterygoid mus- cles to the side of the tongue, where it becomes flattened, and divides into numerous filaments, which are distributed to the papillae and mucous membrane. Relations.—It lies at first between the external pter3'goid muscle and the pharjmx, next between the two pterj’goid muscles, then be- tween the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, and between the stylo-glossus muscle and the submaxillary gland; lastly, it runs along the side of the tongue, resting against the hjm-glossus muscle, and covered in by the mylo-hyoideus and mucous membrane. The gustatory nerve, while between the two pterj'goid muscles, receives a branch from the inferior dental; lower down it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani which passes downwards in the sheath of the gustatory to the submaxillar}' gland, where it unites with447 AURICULAR NERVE.—ARDUCENTES. the submaxillary ganglion. On the hyo-glossus muscle some branches of coimnunicatiou are sent to the hypoglossal, and in the course of the nerve several small branches to the mucous membrane of the fauces, to the tonsils, submaxillary gland, Wharton’s duct, and sublingual gland. The Inferior dental nerve passes downwards with the inferior dent'll artery, at first between the two pterygoid muscles, and then between the'internal lateral ligament and the ramus of the lower jaw, to the dental foramen. It then runs along the canal in the inferior nuixillary bone, distributing branches (inferior maxillary plexus) to the teeth and gums, and divides into two terminal branches, incisive and mental. The incisive branch passes forwards, to supply the incisive teeth: the imntai branch escapes through the mental foramen, to be distributed to the muscles and integument of the chin and lower lip, and to the mucous membrane of the latter, communicating with the facial nerve. The inferior dental nerve gives off but one branch, the mylo-hyoidean, which leaves the nerve just as it is about to enter the dental foramen. This branch pierces the insertion of the internal lateral ligament, and - descends along a groove in the bone to the inferior surface of the mylo- • hyoid muscle, to which, and to the anterior belly of the digastricus, it is distributed. The Anterior auricular nerve originates by two roots, be- tween which the arteria meningea media takes its course, and passes directly backwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw, against which it rests. In this situation it divides into two branches, which reunite, and form a kind of plexus. From the plexus two branches are given otf—ascending and descending. The ascending or temporal branch sends one or two considerable branches of communication to the facial nerve, and then ascends in front of the ear to the temporal re- gion, upon which it is distributed in company with the branches of the temporal artery. In its course it sends filaments to the temporo-max- illary articulation, to the pinna and meatus of the ear, and to the integu- ment of the temporal region. It communicates on the temple with branches of the facial, supra-orbital, lachrymal, and subcutaneus malm nerve. The descending branch enters the parotid gland, to which it sends numerous branches; it communicates with the inferior dental and auricularis magnus nerve, and supplies the external ear, the meatus auditorius, and the temporo-maxillary articulation ; it also sends one or two filaments into the tympanum. Sixth pair, abducentes.—The abducens nerve, about half the size of the motor oculi, arises by several filaments from the upper constricted part of the corpus pyaiuidale close to the pons Varolii. Proceeding forwards from this origin,'1t lies parallel with the basilar arter}', and, piercing the dura mater upon the clivus Blumenbachii of the sphenoid bone, ascends beneath that membrane to the cavernous sinus. It then runs forwards alon^the inner wall of the sinus below448 FACIAL NERVE. the other nerves, and, resting against the internal carotid artery, passes between the two heads of the cxtcnial rectus, and is distributed to that muscle. As it enters the orbit, it lies upon the ophthalmic vein, from which it is separated by a lamina of dura mater. In the cavern- ous sinus it is joined by several filaments from the carotid plexus, by one from Meckel’s ganglion, and one from the ophthalmic nerve. Mr. Mayo traced the origin of this nerve between the fasciculi of the cor- pora pyramidalia to the posterior part of the medulla oblongata; and Mr. Grainger pointed out its connection with the grey substance of the spinal cord. Seventh pair.—The seventh pair consists of two neires* which lie side by side on the posterior border of the crus cerebelli. The smaller and most internal of these, and, at the same time, the most dense in texture, is the facial nerve or portio dura. The external nerve, which is soft and pulpy, and often grooved by contact with the preceding, is the auditory nerve or portio mollis of the seventh pair. Soemmering makes the auditory nerve the eighth pair; but, retaining the classifica- tion of Willis, we regard it as a part of the seventh. Facial Nerve (portio dura).—The facial nerve arises from the upper part of the groove between the corpus olivare and corpus resti- forme, close to the pons Varolii, from which point its fibres may be traced deeply into the corpus restiforme. The nerve then passes for- wards, resting on the crus cerebelli, and comes into relation with the auditory nerve, with which it enters the meatus auditorius intemus, lying at first to the inner side of, and then upon that nerve. At the bottom of the meatus it enters the canal expressly intended for it, the aqueductus Fallopii, and directs its course forwards towards the hiatus Fallopii, where it forms a gangliform swelling (intumescentia gangli- formis, ganglion geniculare), and receives the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. It then curves backwards towards the tjunpanum, and descends along the inner wall of that cavity to the stylo-mastoid fora- men. Emerging at the stylo-mastoid foramen, it passes forwards within the parotid gland, crossing the external jugular vein and exter- ■ nal carotid artery, and at the ramus of the low'er jaw divides into two trunks, temporo-facial and cervico-facial. These trunks at once split |j into numerous branches, which, after forming a number of looped com- > munications (pes anserinus) with each other over the masseter muscle, •: spread out upon the side of the face, from the temple to the neck, to ] be distributed to the muscles of this extensive region. The communications which the facial nerve maintains in its course v * A third nerve of small size, the portio intermedia of Wrisberg, is brought | into view by separating these two trunks. The researches of Dr. Morganti go to show that the portio intermedia is connected, at its origin in the corpus rosti- fonne, with the auditory nerve ; that it is the posterior or sensitive root of the facial; that the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial, is the ganglion of this root; that it bestows the principal part of the sensitive function on the facial; and that the chorda tympani is partly derived from the intumescentia gan^i- formis.FACIAL NERVE. 449 are the following: in the meatus auditorius it sends one or two fila- ments to the auditory nerve; the intumescentia gangliformis receives the nervus petrosus superficialis major and minor, and sends a twig back to the auditory nerve; behind the tympanum the nerve receives one or two twigs from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric ; at its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen it receives a twig from the glosso-pharv'ngeal, and in the parotid gland one or two large branches from the anterior auricular nerve. Besides these, the facial nerve has numerous peripheral communications, with the branches of the fifth nerve on the face, and of the cervical nerves in the parotid gland and on the neck. The numerous communications of the facial nerve have obtained for it the designation of nervus sympatlieticus minor.

(• Temporo-facial, On the face, i Cervi^co-facial. The Tynj/wKic branch is a small filament distributed to the stapedius muscle. The Chorda tympani quits the facial just before that nerve emerges firom the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends by a distinct canal to the upper part of the posterior wall of the tympanum, where it enters that cavity through an opening situated between the base of the pyra- mid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes in- vested by mucous membrane. It then crosses the tympanum between ihe handle of the malleus and long process of the incus to the anterior inferior angle of the cavity, and escapes through a distinct opening in •he fissura Glaseri, and joins the gustatory nerve at an acute angle >€tween the two pterj-goid muscles. Enclosed in a sheath of the pistatorj' nerve, it descends to the submaxillary gland, where it imites viih the submaxillary ganglion. The Posterior auricular nerve ascends behind the ear, between the neatus and mastoid process, and divides into an anterior and a poste- ior branch. The anterior branch receives a filament of commimication fom the auricular branch of the pneiunogastric nerve, and distributes laments to the retrahens and attollens aurem muscles and to the ■inna. The posterior branch communicates with the auricularis mag- us and occipitalis minor, and is distributed to the posterior belly of ae occipito-frontalis. The Stylo-hyoid branch is distributed to the stylo-hyoid muscle. The Digastric branch supplies the posterior belly of the digastricus mscle, jind communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumo- istric nerve. G G450 FACIAL NERVE. The Temporo-facial gives off a nuraljer of branches which are distri- buted over the temple and upper half of the face, supplying the [mus- cles of this region, and communicating with the branches of the auri- cular, the subcutaneus malae, and the supra-orbital nerve. The inferior branches, which accompany Stenon's duct, form a plexus with the terminal branches of the infra-orbital nerve.

The cervical branches form a plexus with the superficialis colli nerve over the submaxillar}' gland, and are distributed to the platysma myoides. Auditory nerve (portio mollis).—The auditory nerve takes its origin in the linete transversae (striae medullares) of the anterior wall or floor of the fourth ventricle, and winds around the corpus restiforme, from which it receives fibres, to the posterior border of the crus cere- belli. It then passes forwards upon the crus cerebelli in company with the facial nerve, which lies in a groove on its superior surface, and enters the meatus auditorius internus, and at the bottom of the meatus it divides into two branches, cochlear and vestibular. The au- ditory nerv'e is soft and pulpy in texture, and receives in the meatus auditorius several filaments from the facial nerve. Eighth pair.—The eighth pair consists of three nerves, glosso- pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory ; these are the ninth, tenth, and eleventh pairs of Soemmering. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve.—The glosso-pharyngeal nerve arises by five or six filaments from the groove between the corpus olivare and restiforme, and escapes from the skull at the innermost extremity of the jugular foramen through a distinct opening in the dura mater, lying an- teriorly to the sheath of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves, and internally to the jugular vein. It then passes forwards between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, and descends along the inferior border of that muscle to tlie hyo-glossus, beneath which it curves to be distributed to the raucous membrane of the base of the tongue and fauces, to the mucous glands of the mouth, and to the tonsils. While situated in the jugular fossa, the nerve presents two gangliform swellings ; one superior (ganglion jugulare of Muller) of small size, and involving only the posterior fibres of the nerve; the other inferior., nearly half an inch below the preced- ing, of larger size, and occupying the whole diameter of the nerve, the ganglion of Andersch* (ganglion petrosum). The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme to the grey substance in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve are— Communicating branches with the Facial, Pneumogastric, Spinal accessory, Tympanic, Sympathetic. Muscular, Pharyngeal, Lingual, Tonsillitic. • Charles Samuel Andersch. “Tractatus Anatomico-Physiologicus de Nervis corporis Human! Aliquibus, 1797.”PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. 452 Tlie Branches of communication proceed from the ganglion and from the upper part of the trunk of the nerve, and are common to the facial, eighth pair, and sympathetic ; they form a complicated plexus at the base of the skull. The Tympanic branch (Jacobson’s nerve) proceeds from the ganglion of Andersch, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately above the ganglion : it enters a small bony canal in the jugular fossa (page 34), and divides into six branches, which are distributed upon the inner wall of the tympanum, and establish a plexiform communication (tym- panic plexus) with the sympathetic, and fifth pair of nerves. The branches of distribution supply the fenestra rotunda, fenestra ovalis, and Eustachian tube : those of communication join the carotid plexus, the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve, and the otic ganglion. The Muscular branch divides into filaments, which are distributed to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, to the posterior belly of the digastri- cus, and to the stylo-hyoideus. The Pharyngeal branches are two or three filaments which are distributed to the pharynx and unite with the pharyngeal branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerve to form the pharyngeal plexus. The Lingual branches enter the substance of the tongue beneath the . hyo-glossus and stylo-glossus muscle, and are distributed to the mu- cous membrane of the side and base of the tongue, and to the epi- glottis and fauces. The Tonsillitic branches proceed from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve near its termination ; they form a plexus (circulus tonsillaris) around the base of the tonsil, from which numerous filaments are given oif to the mucous membrane of the fauces and soft palate. These fila- ments communicate with the posterior palatine branches of Meckel’s ganglion. Pneumogastric nerve (vagus).—The pneumogastric nerve arises by ten or fifteen filaments from the groove between the corpus olivare and corpus restiforme, immediately below the glosso-pharyngeal, and passes out of the skull through the inner extremity of the ju^ar fora- men in a distinct canal of the dura mater. While situated in this canal it presents a small rounded ganglion (ganglion jugulare); and having escaped from the skull, a gangliform swelling (plexus gangli- formis), nearly an inch in length, and surrounded by an irregular plexus of white nerves, which communicate with each other, with the other divisions of the eighth pair, and with the trunk of the pneumo- gastric below the ganglion. The plexus gangliformis (ganglion of the superior laryngeal branch, of Sir Astley Cooper), is situated, at first, behind the internal carotid artery, and then between that vessel and the internal jugular vein. The pneumogastric nerve then descends the neck within the sheath of the carotid vessels, Ijung behind and be- tween the artery and vein, to the root of the neck. Here the course of the nerve at opposite sides becomes different.PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. 453 On the right side it passes between the subclavian artery and vein to the posterior mediastinum, then behind the root of the lung to the ujsophagus, which it accompanies to the stomach, lying on its posterior aspect. On the left it enters the chest parallel with the left subclavian artery, crosses the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the lung, and along the anterior surface of the oesophagus to the stomach. The fibres of origin of the pneumogastric nerve, like those of the glosso-pharyngeal, may be traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme into the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Branches of the pneumogastric nerve are the following:— Commimicating branches with the Facial, Glosso-pharyngeal, Spinal accessory. Hypo-glossal, Sympathetic. Auricular, Pharyngeal, Superior laryngeal. Cardiac, Inferior or recurrent laryngeal. Pulmonary anterior, Pulmonary posterior, CEsophageal, Gastric. The Branches of communication form part of the complicated plexus at the base of the skull. The branches to the ganglion of Andersch are given off by the superior ganglion in the jugular fossa. The A uricular nerve is given off from the lower part of the jugu- lar ganglion, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately below it, and receives immediately after its origin a small branch of communication from the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes outwards behind the jugu- lar vein, and on the outer side of that vessel enters a small canal (page 34) in the petrous portion of the temporal bone near the stylo- mastoid foramen. Guided by this canal it reaches the descending part of the aqueductus Fallopii and joins the facial nerve. In the aque- dnctus Fallopii the auricular nerve gives off two small filaments, one of which communicates with the posterior auricular branch of the facial, while the other is distributed to the pinna. The Pharyngeal nerve arises from the pneumogastric, immediately above the gangliform plexus, and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, upon which it forms the pharyngeal plexus assisted by branches from the glosso- pharyngeal, superior larjmgeal, and sympathetic.

The Superior lurynyeal nerve arises from the gaiigliform plexus of the pneumogastric, of which it appears to be almost a con- tinuation ; hence this plexus was named by Sir Astley Cooper the ganglion of the suj>erior laryngeal branch.'" The nerve descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the th3'ro-hyoidean mem- brane, through which it passes with the superior larjmgeal arterj', and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx and arytenoideus muscle. On the latter, and behind the cricoid cartilage, it communi- cates with the recurrent lar}'n- geal nerve.

This branch communicates inferiorly Avith the reciurent laryngeal and sympathetic nerve. Mr. Hilton of Guy’s Hospital, concludes from his dissections* that the superior larj’iigeal nerve is the 7ierve of sensation to the larynx, being distributed solely (with the exception of its external laryngeal branch and a tAvig to the arytenoideus) to the mucous membrane. If this fact be taken in connection Avith the observations of Sir Astley Cooper, and the dissections of the origin of the nerve by Mr. EdAvard Cock, Ave shall have ample evidence, both in the ganglionic origin of the nerve and in its distribution, of its sensitive function. The recirr- rent, or inferior laryngeal nerve, is the proper motor nerve of the larjTix, and is distributed to its muscles. The Cardiac branches, two or three in number, arise from the pneu- mogastric in the loAver part of the neck, and cross the inferior part of the common carotid, to communicate Avith the cardiac branches of the sym- pathetic, and Avith the great cardiac plexus. The Recurrent laryngeid, or inferior laryngeal nerve, curves around the subclavian artery on the right, and the arch of the aorta on the left side. It ascends in the groove‘betAveen the trachea and oesopha- gus, and piercing the loAver fibres of the inferior constrictor muscle enters the larynx close to the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage. It is distributed to all the muscles of the laiynx, with the exception of the crico-thyroid, and commrmi- cates on the arytenoideus muscle Avith the superior laryngeal nerve. As it ciuwes around the subclavian artery and aorta it gives branches to the heart and root of the lungs; and as it ascends the neck it dis- tributes filaments to the oesophagus and trachea, and communicates with the external laryngeal nerve and sympathetic. The Anterior pulmonary branches are distributed upon the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs, forming, with branches from the great cardiac plexus, the anterior pulmonary plexus. The Posterior pulmonary branches, more numerous than the ante- rior, are distributed upon the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs, and are joined by branches from the great cardiac plexus, forming the posterior pulmonary plexus. Upon the oesophagus the tAvo nerves divide into numerous branches which communicate Avith each other and constitute the oesophageal plexus which completely surrounds the cylinder of the oesophagus, and accompanies it to the cardiac orifice of the stomach. The Gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the tAvo pneumo- gastric nerves; they are spread out upon the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach, and are likewise distributed to the omentum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder, and communicate, particularly the right nerve, Avith the solar plexus. * Guy’s Hospital Reports, vol. ii.456 SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. Spinal accessory nerve.—The spinal accessory nerve arises by several filaments from the side of the spinal cord as low down as the fourth or fifth cervical nerve, and ascends behind the ligamentum den- ticulatum, and between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal Fig. 152.* * The anatomy of' the side of the neck, shewing the nerves of the tongue. 1.

It communicates in its course with the posterior root of the first cervical nerve, and entering the foramen lacerum becomes applied against the posterior aspect of the ganglion jugulare of the pneumogastric, being contained in the same sheiith of dura mater. In the jugular fossa it divides into two branches; the smaller joins the pneumogastric immediately below the jugular ganglion, and contributes to the formation of the pharyngeal nerve; the larger or true continuation of the nerve passes backwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends obliquely to the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It pierces the sterno-mastoid, and then passes obliquely across the neck, communicating with the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves, and is distributed to the trapezius. The spinal accessory sends numerous twigs to the sterno-mastoid in its passage through that muscle, and in the trapezius the nervous filaments may be traced downw.irds to its lower border. The pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves together (nervus vagus cum accessorio) resemble a spinal nerve, of which the former with its ganglion is the posterior and sensitive root, the latter the an- terior and motor root. Ninth pair.* Hypoglossal nerve (lingual). The hypoglos- sal nerve arises from .the groove between the corpus pyramidale and corpus olivare by ten or fifteen filaments, which being collected into two bundles, escape from the cranium through the anterior condyloid foramen. The nerve then passes forwards between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and descends along the anterior and inner side of the vein to a point parallel with the angle of the lower jaw. It next curves inwards around the occipital artery, with which it forms a loop, and crossing the lower part of the hyo- glossus muscle to the genio-hyo-glossus, sends filaments onwards with the anterior fibres of that muscle as far as the tip of the tongue. It is distributed to the muscles of the tongue, and principally to the genio-hyo-glossus. While resting on the hyo-glossus muscle it is flattened, and beneath the mylo-hyoideus it communicates with the gustatory nerve. At its origin, the hypoglossal nerve sometimes communicates with the posterior root of the first cervical nerve. The Branches of the hjq)oglossal nerve are :— Communicating branches with the Pneumogastric, Spinal accessory. First and second cervical nerves. Sympathetic. Descendens noni, Thyro-hyoidean branch. Communicating filaments with the gustatory nerve. • The twelfth pair according to the arrangement of Soemmering.458 SPINAL NERVES. The Communications with the pneumogastric and spinal accessory take place through the medium of a plexiform interlacement of branches at the base of the skull, behind the internal jugular vein. The com- munications with the sympathetic nerve are derived from the superior cervical ganglion. The Descendens noni is a long and slender twig, which quits the hypoglossal just as that nerve is about to form its arch around the occipital artery, and descends upon the sheath of the carotid vessels. Just below the middle of the neck it forms a loop with a long branch (communicans noni) from the second and third cerviciil nerves. From the convexity of this loop branches are sent to the stemo-hyoideus, stemo-thyroideus, and both bellies of the omo-hyoideus; sometimes also a twig is given off to the cardiac plexus, and occasionally one to the phrenic nerve. If the descendens noni be traced to its origin, it wUl be found to be formed by a branch from the hypoglossal, and one from the first and second cervical nerves ; occasionally it receives also a filament from the pneumogastric. The Thyro-hyoidean nerve, is a small branch, distributed to the thyro-hyoideus muscle. It is given off from the trunk of the hypo- glossal near the posterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle, and de- scends obliquely over the great cornu of the os hyoides. The Communicating filaments, with the gustatory nerv'e, are several small twigs, which ascend upon the hy^^oglossus muscle near its ante- rior border, and form a kind of plexus with filaments sent down by the gustatory nerve. SPINAL NERVES. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, each arising by two roots, an anterior or motor root, and a posterior or sensitive root. The anterior roots proceed from a narrow white line, anterior lateral sulcus, on the antero-lateral column of the spinal cord, and gradually approach towards the anterior longitudinal fissure as they descend. The posterior roots, more regular than the anterior, proceed from the posterior lateral sulcus, a narrow grey stria formed by the internal grey substance of the cord. They are larger, and the filaments of origin more numerous than those of the anterior roots. In the inter- vertebral foramina there is a ganglion on each of the posterior roots. The first cervical nerve forms an exception to these characters ; its posterior root is smaller than the anterior ; it often joins in whole or in part with the spinal accessory nerve, and sometimes with the hj^o- glossal : there is frequently no ganglion upon it, and when the ganglion exists, it is often situated within the dura mater, the latter being the usual position of the ganglia of the last two pairs of spinal nerves.459 SPINA I. NERVKS. After the fonnation of a ganglion, the two roots unite, and consti- tute a spinal nerve, which escapes through the intervertebral foramen, and divides into an anterior branch for the supply of the front aspect of the body, and a posterior branch for the posterior aspect. In the first cervical and last two sacral nerves this division takes place with- Fig. 153.* in the dura mater and in the upper four sacral nerves externally to that cavity, but within the sacral canal. The anterior branches, with the exception of the first two cervical nerves, are larger than the poste- rior ; an arrangement which is proportioned to the larger extent of surface they are required to supply.

CERVICAL NERVES. The cervical nerves increase in size from above downwards ; the first (sub-occipital) passes out of the spinal canal between the occipital bone and the atlas ; and the last between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebra. Each nerve, at its escape from the intervertebral foramen, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus; the posterior branches, the posterior cervical plexus. Tlie anterior branches of the four inferior cervical together with the first dorsal form the brachial plexus. Anterior cervical nerves.—The anterior branch of the first cervical nerve escapes from the vertebral canal through the groove, up- on the posterior arch of the atlas, which supports the vertebral artery, lying beneath that vessel. It then descends in front of the transverse process of the atlas, sends several twigs to the rectus lateralis and recti antici, and forms an anastomotic loop by communicating with an ascending branch of the second nerve. The anterior branch of the second cervical nerve at its exit from the intervertebral foramen between the atlas and the axis, gives twdgs to the rectus anticus major, scalenus posticus and levator anguli scapulae, and divides into three branches, viz. an ascending branch, which completes the arch of communication with the first nerve ; and two descending branches, which communicate with the third nerve. The anterior branch of the tJiird cervical nerve, double the size of the preceding, divides at its exit from the intervertebral foramen into numerous branches, some of which are distributed to the rectus major, longus colli, and scalenus posticus, while others communicate and form loops and anastomoses with the second and fourth nerve. The anterior branch of the fourth cervical nerve, of the same size with the preceding, sends twigs to the rectus major, longus colli, and levator anguli scapulae, communicates by anastomosis with the third, and sends a small branch downwards to the fifth nerve. Its principal branches pass downwards and outwards across the posterior triangle of the neck, towards the clavicle and acromion. The anterior branches of the fifth, sixth, seventh and ei-gltih cervical nerves will be described with the brachial plexus, of which they form a part. CERVICAL PLEXUS.

The Superficiatis colli is formed by communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves ; it curves around the posterior border of the stemo-mastoid and crosses obliquely behind the external jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, where it divides into an ascending and a descending branch ; the descending hranch is distributed to the integument on the side and front of the neck, as low down as the clavicle ; the ascending hranch passes upwards to the submaxillar}’- region, and divides into four or five filaments, some of which pierce the platysma myoides, and supply the integument as high up as the chin and the lower part of the face, while others form a plexus with the descending branches of the facial nerve beneath the platysma. One or two filaments from this nerve accompany the ex- ternal jugular vein. The Auricidaris niagnm, the largest of the three ascending branches of the cervical plexus, also proceeds from the second and third cervical nerve ; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends upon that muscle, lying parallel with the external jugular vein, to the parotid gland, where it divides into an anterior and a pos- terior branch. The anterior branch is distributed to the integument over the parotid gland, to the gland itself, communicating with the facial nerve, and to the external ear. The posterior branch pierces the parotid gland, and crosses the mastoid process, where it divides into filaments which supply the posterior part of the pinna and the integument of the side of the head. These filaments communicate with the posterior auricular branch of the facial and with the occipitalis minor, Pre- ■viously to its division, the auricularis magnus nerve sends off several facial branches which are distributed to the cheek. The Occipitalis minor avisos from the second cervical nerve; it curves around the posterior border of the stemo-mastoid above the preceding and ascends upon that muscle, parallel with its posterior border, to the lateral and posterior side of the head. It is distributed to the integu- ment and to the muscles of this region, namely, to the occipito-fronta- lis, attollens and attrahens aurem, and communicates with the occipi-I'OSTKIUOR CKllVICAL NERVES. 4G-2 tails major, auricularis magnus, and posterior auricular branch of the facial. The Acromuiifs and Chivicuhn’s arc two or three large nerves which proceed from the fourth cervical nen-e, and divide into numerous branches which pass downwards over the clavicle, and are distributed to the integument of the upper and anterior part of the chest from the sternum to the shoulder. The Comnumicatimf branches are filaments which arise from the loop between the first and second cer\*ical nerve, and pass inwards to com- municate with the sympathetic, the pneumogastric, and the hypoglossal nerve. The first three cervical nerves send branches to the first cervical ganglion ; the fourth sends a branch to the trunk of the svm- pathetic, or to the middle cervical ganglion. From the second cer\ical nerve a large branch is given off, which goes to join the spinal acces- sory nerve. The Mtiscular bmnehes proceed from the third and fourth cervical nerves ; they are distributed to the trapezius, levator anguli scapul®, and rhomboidei muscles. The Communicans noni is a long, and slender branch fonned by fila- ments from the first, second, and third cervical nerves : it descends upon the outer side of the internal jugular vein, and forms a loop with the descendens noni over the sheath of the carotid vessels. The Phrenic nerm (internal respiratory of Bell) is formed by the union of filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, and one from the sympathetic. It descends to the root of the neck, resting on the scalenus anticus muscle, then crosses the first portion of the subclavian iirtery, and enters the chest between it and the subclavian vein. Within the chest it passes through the middle mediastinum, between the pleura and pericardium, and in front of the root of the lung to the diaphragm, to which it is distnbuted. Some of its filaments reach the abdomen through the openings for the oeso- phagus and vena cava, and communicate with the phrenic and solar plexus, and on the right side with the hepatic plexus. The left phrenic nerve is rather longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side. Po.sTKRiOR cKRVic.\L NERVES.—The posterior division of the .first cervical nerve (sub-occipital), larger th.an the anterior, escapes from the vertebral canal through the opening for the ^-ertebral artery, lying posteriorly to that vessel, and emerges into the triangular space formed by the rectus posticus major, obliquus superior, and obliquus inferior. It is distributed to the recti and obliqui muscles, and sends one or two filaments downwards to communicate nfith the second cervical nerve. The posterior branch of the sc-comi cervical ncrt'c is three or four times greater than the anterior branch, and is larger than the other posterior cervical nerves. The posterior branch of the third cervical nerve is smaller than the preceding, but larger than the fourth; and the other posterior cervical nerves go on progressivelj* decreasing to the seventh.463 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The posterior branches of the fourth, fifth, si.xtli, seventli, and eighth nerves pass inwards between the muscles of the back in the cervical and upper part of the dorsiil region, and reaching the sui-face near the middle line, are reflected outwards, to be distributed to the integu- ment. The fourth and fifth are nearly transverse in their course, and lie between the semispinalis colli and complexus. The sixth, seventh, and eighth are directed nearly vertically downwards; they pierce the aponeurosis of origin of the splenius and trapezius. Posterior cervical plexus.—This ^plexus is constituted by the succession of anastomosing loops and communications which pass be- tween the posterior branches of the first, second, and third cervical nerves. It is situated between the complexus and semispinalis colli, and its branches are the— Musculo-cutaneous, Occipitalis major. The Musculo-cutaneous branches pass inwards between the com- plexus and semispinalis colli to the ligamentum nuchm, distributing muscular filaments in their course. They then pierce the aponeurosis of the trapezius and become subcutaneous, sending branches outwards to supply the integument of the posterior aspect of the neck, and up- wards to the posterior region of the scalp. The Occipitalis major is the direct continuation of the second cer- vical nerve ; it ascends obliquely inwards, between the obliquus infe- • rior and complexus, pierces the complexus and trapezius after pass- ing for a short distance between them, and ascends on the posterior aspect of the head between the integument and occipito-frontalis, in company with the occipital artery. The occipitalis major sends nu- merous branches to the muscles of the neck, and is distributed to the integument of the scalp, as far forwards as the middle of the vertex of the head. Its filaments communicate with those of the occipitalis minor. BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The Brachial or axillary plexus of nerves is formed by communi- cations between the anterior branches of the last four cervical nerves and first dorsal. These nerves are all similar in size, and their mode of disposition in the formation of the plexus is the following; the fifth and sixth nerves unite to form a common trunk, which soon divides into two branches; the last cervical and first dorsal also unite immedi- ately on their exit from the intervertebral foramina, and the common trunk residting from their union, after a short course, also divides into two branches; the seventh nerve passes outwards between the com- mon trunks of the two preceding, and opposite the clavicle divides into a superior branch which unites with the inferior division of the supe- rior trunk, and an inferior branch which communicates with the supe- rior division of the inferior trunk: from these divisions and communi-464 BRACHIAL PLEXUS.—BRANCHES. cations the brachial plexus results. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by means of a branch sent down from the fourth to the fifth nerve, and by the inferior branch of origin of the phrenic nerve, and also sends filaments of communication to the sym- pathetic. ^le plexus is broad in the neck, narrows as it descends into the axilla, and again enlarges at its lower part where it divides into its terminal branches. Relations.—The brachial plexus is in relation in the neck with the two scaleni muscles, between which its nerves issue; lower doivn it is placed between the clavicle and subclavius muscle above, and the first rib and first serration of the serratus magnus muscle below. In the axilla, it is situated at first to the outer side and then behind the axillary artery, resting by its outer border against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. At this point it completely surrounds the artery by means of the two cords which are sent off to form the median nerve. Its Branches may be arranged into two groups, humeral and de- scending,— Humeral Branches. Superior muscular. Short thoracic. Long thoracic. Supra-scapular. Subscapular, Inferior muscular. Descending Branches. External cutaneous. Internal cutaneous. Lesser internal cutaneous, Median, Ulnar, Musculo-spiral, Circumflex. The superior Muscular nerves are several large branches which are given off by the fifth cervical nerve above the clavicle; they are, a sub- clavian branch to the subclavius muscle, which usually sends a commu- nicating filament to the phrenic nerve ; a rhomboid branch to the rhom- boidei muscles ; and frequently an angular branch to the levator anguli scapulae. The Short thoradc nerves (anterior) are two in number; they arise from the brachial plexus at a point parallel with the clavicle, and are divisible into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch passes forwards between the subclavius muscle and the subclavian vein, and is distributed to the pectoralis major muscle, entering it by its costal surface. In its course it sends one or two twigs to the del- toid muscle, and gives off a branch which forms a loop of communica- tion with the posterior branch. The posterior branch passes forward beneath the axillary artery and unites with the communicating branch of the preceding to form a loop, from which numerous filaments are given off to the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor. The Long thoracic nei've (posterior thoracic, external respiratory of Bell) is a long and remarkable branch, which arises from the fourth and fifth cervical nerves, immediately after their escape from the inter-465 EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. vertebral foramina. It passes down behind the plexus and axillary ves- sels, resting on the scalenus posticus muscle; it then descends along the side of the chest upon the serratus magnus muscle to its lowest ser- ration. It sends numerous filaments to this muscle. The Suprascapular nerve arises above the clavicle from the fifth cer- vical nerve and descends obliquely outwards to the supra-scapular notch; it then passes through the notch, crosses the supra-spinous fossa be- neath the supra-spinatus muscle, and passing in front of the concave margin of the spine of the scapula enters the infra-spinous fossa. It is distributed to the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus muscle. The Suhscapular nei-ves are two in number; one arises from the brachial plexus above the clavicle, the other from the posterior aspect of the plexus within the axilla. They are distributed to the subscapu- laris muscle. The Inferior muscular nerves are two or three branches which pro- ceed from the lower and back part of the brachial plexus, and are dis- tributed to the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The former of these is the longer, and follows the course of the subscapular artery. The terminal branches of the plexus are arranged in the following order: the external cutaneous, and one head of the median to the outer side of the artery; the other head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous, and ulnar, upon its inner side; and the cir- cumflex and musculo-spiral behind. The External cutaneous nerve (musculo-cutaneous, perforans Casserii) arises from the brachial plexus in common with the external head of the median; it pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle and passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus, to the outer side of the bend of the elbow, where it perforates the fascia, and divides into an external and an internal branch. These branches pass behind the me- dian cephalic vein, the extemal,^e larger of the two, taking the course of the radial vein and communicating with the branches of the radial nerve on the back of the hand; the internal and smaller following the direction of the supinator longus, communicating with the internal cutaneous, and at the lower third of the fore-arm sending off a twig, which accompanies the radial artery to the wrist, and distributes fila- ments to the synovial membranes of the joint. The external cutaneous nerve supplies the coraco-brachialis, biceps : and brachialis anticus in the upper arm,-and the integument of the outer side of the fore-arm as far as the wrist and hand. The Internal cutaneous nerve is one of the internal and smaller branches of the axillary plexus; it arises from the plexus in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and passes down the inner side of the arm in company with the basilic ' vein, giving off several cutaneous filaments in its course. At about • the middle of the upper arm it pierces the deep fascia by the side of the basilic vein and divides into two branches, anterior and H HINTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. 46C ( posterior.

The Lesser internal cuta- neous NERVE or nerve of Wrisierg, the smallest of the branches of the brachial plexus, is very irregular in point of origin. It is a long and slender nerve, and usually arisesfrom the common trunk of the last cervi- cal and first dorsal nerve.

BRANCHES. nerve, to the middle of the posterior aspect of the upper arm, where it pierces the fascia and is distributed to the integument of the elbow, communicating with filaments of the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous and with the spiral cutaneous. In its course it gives off two or three cutaneous filaments to the integument of the inner and anterior aspect of the upper arm. The Median nerve has received its name from taking a course along the middle of the fore-arm to the palm of the hand; it is, there- fore, intermediate in position between the radial and ulnar nerves. It commences by two heads, which embrace the axillary artery ; lies at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, which it crosses at its mid- dle ; and descends on its inner side to the bend of the elbow. It then passes between the two h^ads of the pronator radii teres and flexor sublimis digitorum, and runs down the fore-arm, between the flexor sublimis and profundus, and beneath the annular Kgament, to the palm of the hand. The Branches of the median nerve are,— Muscular, Superficial palmar. Anterior interosseous, Digital. The Muscular branches are given off by the nerve at the bend of the elbow; they are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and to the periosteum. The branch to the pronator radii teres sends off reflected filaments to the elbow-joint. The Anterior interosseous is a large branch accompanying the ante- rior interosseous arterj’’, and supplying the deep layer of muscles in the fore-arm. It passes beneath the pronator quadratus muscle, and pierces the interosseous membrane near the wrist. On reaching the posterior aspect of the wrist it joins a large and remarkable ganglion, which gives off a number of branches for the supply of the joint. The Su-perficial 'palmar branch arises from the median nerve at about the lower fourth of the fore-arm ; it crosses the annular ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the ball of the thumb and the palm of the hand. The median nerve at its termination in the palm of the hand is spread out and flattened, and divides into six branches, one muscular and divides into six tcrminarbranches.

The digital branches send twigs to the lumbri- cales muscles and are thus arranged: two pass outwards to the thumb to supply its borders ; one to the radial side of the index finger ; one subdivides for the supply of the adjacent sides of the index and mid- dle finger^; and the remaining one, for the supply of the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers. The digifiil nerves in their course along the fingers are situated to the inner side of the digital arteries. Opposite the base of the first phalanx each nerve gives off a dorsal branch which runs along the border of the dorsum of the finger. Near the extremity of the finger the digital nerve divides into & palmar dcnUi a dorsal branch; the former supplying the sentient extremity of the finger, and the latter the structures around and beneath the nail. The digital nerve maintains no communication with its fellow of the oppo- site side. The Ulnar nerve is somewhat smaller than the median, behind which it lies, gradually diverging from it in its course. It arises from the brachial plexus in common with the internal head of the median and the internal cutaneous nerve, and runs down the inner side of the arm, to the groove between the internal condyle and olecranon, resting upon the internal head of the triceps, and accompanied by the inferior profunda artery. At the elbow it is superficial, and supported by the inner condyle, against which it is easily compressed, giving rise to the thrilling sensation along the inner side of the fore-arm and little finger, ascribed to striking the “ funny bone.” It then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and descends along the inner side of the fore-arm, crosses the annular ligament, and divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. At the commencement of the middle third of the fore-arm, it becomes applied against the arterj^and lies to the ulnar side of that vessel, as far as the hand. The Branches of the ulnar nerve are,— Muscular in the upper arm, Dorsal branch. Articular, Superficial palmar, Muscular in the fore-arm. Deep palmar. Anastomotic, The Muscular branches in the upper arm are a few filaments distri- buted to the triceps. ^ The Articular branches are several filaments to the elbow-joint, which are given off from the nerve as it lies in the groove between the inner condyle and the olecranon. The Muscular branches in the fore-arm are distributed to the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor profundus digitorum muscle. The Anastomotic branch (n. cutaneus palniaris ulnaris) is a small nerve which arises from the ulnar at about the middle of the fore-arm, and divides into a deep and a superficial branch; the former accompa-469 MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE, nies the iilnar arten*, the latter pierces the deep fascia and is distri- buted to the integument, communicating with the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve. The Dorsal branch passes backwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, at the lower third of the fore-arm, and divides into branches which supply the integument and two fingers and a half on the posterior aspect of the hand, communicating with the internal cutaneous and radial nerve. The Superficial palmar branch divides into three filaments, which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, one to the adjoining borders of the little and ring fingers, and a communicating branch to join the median nerve. The Deep palmar branch passes between the abductor and flexor minimi digiti, to the deep palmar arch, supplying the muscles of the little finger, and the interossei and other deep structures in the palm of the hand. The Musculo-spiral nerve, the largest branch of the brachial plexus, arises from the posterior part of the plexus by a common trunk ■with the circumflex nerve. It passes downwards from its origin in front of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscle, and winds around the humerus in the spiral groove, accompanied by the superior profunda artery, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, and thence onwards to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two branches, the posterior interosseous and radial nerve. The Branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are,— Muscular, Spiral cutaneous. Radial, Posterior interosseous. The Muscular branches are distributed to the triceps, to the supina- tor longus, and to the extensor carpi radialis longior. The Spiral cutaneous nerve pierces the deep fascia immediately below the insertion of the deltoid muscle, and passes down the outer side of the fore-arm as far as the wrist. It is distributed to the in- tegument. The Radial nerve runs along the radial side of the fore-arm to the commencement of its lower third ; it then passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and at about two inches above the wrist-joint pierces the deep fascia and divides into an external and an internal branch. The external branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the outer border of the hand and thumb, and communicates with the posterior branch of the external cutaneous nerve. The internal branch crosses the direction of the extensor tendons of the thumb and divides into several filaments for the supply of the ulnar border of the thumb.470 CIUCUMFLKX NERVE. DORSAL NERVES. the radial border of the index finger, and the adjacent borders of the index and middle fingers. It communicates on the back of the hand Avith the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. In the upper third of the fore-ann the radial nerve lies beneath the border of the supinator longus muscle. In the middle third it is in re- lation with the radial artery, lying to its outer side. It then quits the artery, and passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, to reach the back of the hand. The Posterior interosseous nerve, somcAvhat larger than the radial, separates from the latter at the bend of the elbow, pierces the supina- tor-brevis muscle, and emerges from- its lower border on the posterior aspect of the fore-arm, where it divides into branches Avhich supply the whole of the muscles on the posterior aspect of the fore-arm. One branch, longer than the rest, descends to the posterior part of the wrist, and forms a gangliform swelling (the common character of nerves which supply joints), from which numerous filaments are distributed to the Avrist-joint. The Circumflex nerve arises from the posterior part of the brachial plexus by a common trunk Avith the musculo-spiral nerve. It passes doAvnwards over the border of the subscapularis muscle, Avinds around the neck of the humerus with the posterior circumflex artery, and terminates by dividing into numerous branches which supply the deltoid muscle. The Branches of the circumflex nerve are, muscular and cutaneous. The Muscular branches are distributed to the subscapularis, teres minor, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and deltoid. The cutaneous branches pierce the deltoid muscle and are distributed to the integument of the shoulder. One of these cutaneous branches (cutaneus brachii superior), larger than the rest, winds around the posterior border of the deltoid, and divides into filaments which pass in a radiating direction across the shoulder, and are distributed to the integument. dorsal nerves. The dorsal nerves are tAvelve in number on each side; the first appears betAveen the first and second dorsal vertebrae, and the last betAveen the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar. They are smaller than the lower cervical ner\ms, and diminish gradually in size from the first to the tenth, and then increase to the tAvelfth. Each nerve, as soon as it has escaped from the intervertebral foramen, divides into two branches ; a dorsal branch and the true intercostal nerve. The Dorsal branehes pass directly backAAurds between the trans- verse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the anterior costo- transverse ligament, and each nerAm diAudes into an anterior or mus- cular and a posterior or musculo-cutaneous branch. The muscular branch enters the substance of the muscles in the direction of a line corresponding Avith the interval of separation between the longissimus471 INTERCOSTAL NERVES. (lorsi and sacro-lumbalis, and is distributed to the muscles of the back, its terminal filaments reaching the integument. The musculo-cutuneous branch passes inwards, crossing the semi-spinalis dorsi, to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae, giving off muscular branches in its course ; it then pierces the aponeurosis of origin of the trapezius and latissimus dorsi, and divides into branches which are directed out- wards and are distributed to the integument. The dorsal branch of the first dorsal nerve resembles in its mode of distribution the dorsal branches of the last cervical. The dorsal branches of the last four dorsal nerves pass obliquely downwards and outwards into the substance of the erector spinae in the situation of the inter- space between the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. After supply- ing the erector spinae, and communicating freely with each other, they approach the surface along the outer border of the sacro-lumbalis, where they pierce the aponeuroses of the transversalis, internal oblique, ser- ratus posticus inferior, and latissimus dorsi, and divide into internal branches which supply the integument in the lumbar region towards the middle line, and external branches which are distributed to the in- tegument of the lumbar and gluteal region. Intercostal nerves.—The Intercostal nerves receive one or two filaments from the adjoining ganglia of the sympathetic, and pass for- wards in the intercostal space with the intercostal vessels, lying below the veins and artery, and supplying the intercostal muscles in their course. At the termination of the intercostal spaces near the sternum, the nerves pierce the intercostal and pectoral muscles, and incline downwards and outwards to be distributed to the integument of the mamma and front of the chest. Those which are situated between the false ribs pass behind the costal cartilages, and between the trans- versalis and obliquus intemus muscles, and supply the rectus and the integument on the front of the abdomen. The first and last dorsal nerves are exceptions to this distribution. The anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve divides into two branches ; a smaller, which takes its course along the under surface of the first rib to the sternal extremity of the first intercostal space ; and a larger, which crosses obliquely the neck of the first rib, to join the brachial plexus. The last dorsal nerve, next in size to the first, sends a branch of com- munication to the first lumbar nerve, to assist in forming the lumbar plexus. The Branches of each intercostal nerve are, a muscular twig to the intercostal and neighbouring muscles, and a cutaneous branch which is given off at about the middle of the arch of the rib. The first inter- costal nerve has no cutaneous branch. The cutaneous branches of the second and third intercostal nerves are named, from their origin and distribution, intercosto-humeral. The First intercosto-humeral nerve is of large size; it pierces the external intercostal muscle of the second intercostal space, and di-472 LUMBAR NERVES. yides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the arm. The external branch communicates with the nerve of Wrisberg, and divides into filaments which supply the integument of the inner and posterior aspect of the arm as far as the elbow. This nerve sometimes takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg. The Second intercosto-humeral nerve is much smaller than the preceding ; it emerges from the external intercostal muscle of the third intercostal space between the serrations of the serratus magnus muscle, and divides into filaments which are distributed to the integu- ment of the shoulder. One of these filaments may be traced inwards to the integument of the mamma. The two intercosto-humeral nerves not unfrequently communicate previously to their distribution. The cutaneous branches of the fourth and fifth intercostal nerves send anterior twigs to the integument of the mammary gland and pos- terior filaments to the scapular region of the back. The cutaneous branches of the remaining intercostal nerves reach the surface between the serrations of the serratus magnus muscle above, and the external oblique below, and each nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior branch ; the former being distributed to the integument of the antero- lateral, and the latter to that of the lateral part of the trunk. The cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve is remarkable for its large size (n. clunium superior anticus) ; it pierces the internal and external oblique muscles, crosses the anterior part of the crest of the ilium, and is distributed to the integmnent of the gluteal region as low down as the trochanter major. LUMBAR nerves. There are five pairs of lumbar nerves, of which the first makes its appearance between the first and second lumbar vertebras, and the last between the fifth lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The anterior branches increase in size from above downwards. They communicate at their origin with the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic, and pass obliquely outwards behind the psoas magnus, or between its fasciculi, sending twigs to that muscle and to the quadratuslumborum. In this situation each nerve divides into two branches, a superior branch which ascends to form a loop of communication wdth the nerve above ; and an inferior branch which descends to join in like manner the nerve below. The communications and anastomoses which are thus established constitute the lumbar plexus. The posterior branches diminish in size from above downwards; they pass backwards between the transverse processes of the corresponding vertebrae, and each nerve divides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, passes inwards to be distributed to the multifidus spinae and interspinales, and be-LUMBAR PLEXUS. 473 coming cutaneous, supplies the integument of the lumbar region on the middle line. The external branches communicate with each other by several loops, and after supplying the deeper muscles, pierce the sacro- lumbalis to reach the integument to which they are distributed. The external branches of the three lower lumbar nerves (nervi clunium su- periores postici) descend over the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and are distributed to the integument of the gluteal region. LUMB.4.R PLEXUS. The Lumbar plexus is formed by the communications and anasto- moses which take place between the anterior branches of the five lum- bar nerves, and between the latter and the last dorsal. It is narrow above, and increases in breadth inferiorly, and is situated between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae and the quadratus lumbo- rum behind, and the psoas magnus muscle in front. The Branches of the lumbar plexus are the— Musculo-cutaneous, External cutaneous, Genito-crural, Crural, Obturator, Lumbo-sacral. The Musculo-cutaneous nerves, two in number, superior and inferior, proceed from the first lumbar nerve. The superior musculo- cutaneous nerve (ilio-scrotal, ilio-hypogastricus), passes outwards be- tween the posterior fibres of the psoas magnus, and crossing obliquely the quadratus lumborum to the middle of the crest of the ilium, pierces the transversalis muscle, and gives olf a cutaneous branch. It then winds along the crest of the ilium between the transversalis and in- ternal oblique, and divides into two branches, abdominal and scrotal. The abdominal branch is continued forwards parallel with the last in- tercostal nerve to near the rectus muscle, to which it sends branches, and perforates the aponeuroses of the internal and external oblique to be distributed to the integument of the mens pubis and groin. The scrotal branch, opposite the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, communicates with the inferior musculo-cutaneous nerve, and passes forward to the external abdominal ring. It then pierces the cremaster muscle, and accompanies the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female, to be distributed to the integument of the scrotum or external labium. The inferior musculo-cutaneous nerve (ilio-inguinal) also arises from the first lumbar nerve. It is smaller than the preceding, crosses the quadratus lumborum below it, and curves along the crest of the ilium to the anterior superior spinous process, resting in its course upon the iliac fascia. It then pierces474 EXPERNAXv CUTANEOUS NERVE.

The anterior nerve dindes into two branches, which are distributed to the integument of the outer border of the thigh, and to the articulation of the knee. The Genito-crural proceeds also from the second lumbar nerve. It traverses the psoas magnus from behind forwards, and runs down the anterior surface of that muscle, lying beneath its fascia, to near Poupart’s ligament, where it divides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch (n. spermaticus seu pudendus extemus) crosses the external iliac artery to the internal abdominal ring, and descends along the spermatic canal, lying behind the cord, to the scrotum, where it divides into branches which supply the spermatic cord and cremaster muscle. In the female it gives branches to the round liga- ment and external labium. At the internal abdominal ring this nerve sends off a branch which, after supplying the lower border of the in- ternal oblique and transversalis, is distributed to the integument of the groin. The crural branch (lumbo-inguinalis), the most external of the two, descends along the outer border of the external iliac artery, and, crossing the origin of the circumflex ilii, enters the sheath of the femo- ral vessels in front of the femoral artery. It pierces the sheath below Poupart’s ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the ante- rior aspect of the thigh as far as its middle. This nerve is often very small, and sometimes communicates with one of the cutaneous branches of the crural nerve. The Crural, or Femoral nerve, is the largest of the divisions of the lumbar plexus ; it is formed by the \inion of branches from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, and, emerging from beneath the psoas muscle, passes downwards in the groove between it and the iliacus, and beneath Poupart’s ligament into the thigh, where it spreads out and divides into numerous branches. At Poupart’s liga- ment it is separated from the femoral artery by the breadth of the psoas muscle (which at this point is scarcely more than half an inch in diameter), and by the iliac fascia, beneath which it lies. Branches.—While situated within the pelvis, the crural nerve gives off several muscular branches to the iliacus, and one to the psoas. On emerging from beneath Poupart’s ligament, the nerve becomes flat- tened, and divides into numerous branches, which may be arranged into— Cutaneous, Muscular, Branch to the femoral sheath. Short saphenous nerve. Long saphenous nerve. The Cutaneous nerves (middle cutaneous), two in number, proceed •from the anterior part of the' crural, and after perforating the sar- ■torius muscle, to which they give filaments, pierce the fascia lata, and476 SAPHENOUS NERVES. are distributed to the inteji^ment of the middle and lower part of the thigh and of tlie knee. The most external of these nerves perforates the upper part of the sartorius, communicates with the crural branch of the genito-crural, divides into two branches at about the middle of the thigh, and gives off numerous filaments to the anterior and outer aspect of the limb as far as the patella. The internal nerve perforates the muscle at about its middle, pierces the fascia lata at the lower third of the thigh, descends to the inner condyle, and curves forward to the front of the knee, supplying the integument by many filaments. Besides these, another cutaneous branch derived from the muscular twig to the vastus externus, is found on the outer side of the lower third of the thigh. The Muscular branches are several large twigs which are distributed to the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thigh. One of these is sent to the rectus; one, (which gives off a cutaneous twig to the outer aspect of the thigh), to the vastus externus ; one to the cruraeus, and one large and long branch to the vastus intemus. From the two latter, filaments are distributed to the periosteum and knee-joint. The sartorius receives its supply of nerves from the cutaneous nerves by which it is perforated. The Branch to the femoral sheath is a small nerve which passes in- wards to the sheath of the femoral vessels at the upper part of the ; thigh, and divides into several filaments, which entwine with the fe- moral and profunda vessels. Two of these filaments, one from the front and the other fi^om the posterior part of the sheath, unite to form a small nerve which escapes from the saphenous opening, and passes downwards with the saphenous vein. Other filaments are distributed to the adductor muscles, and communicate with the long saphenous nerve. The Short saphenous nerve (n. cutaneus intemus) inclines inwards to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and divides into a superficial and ; a deep branch. The superficial branch passes downwards along the ! inner border of the sartorius muscle to the lower third of the thigh; it j then pierces the fascia lata, joins the internal saphenous vein, and | accompanies that vessel to the knee-joint, where it terminates by ! communicating with the long saphenous nerve. The deep branch descends on the outer side of the sheath of the femoral vessels, and- crosses the sheath at its lower part to a point opposite the temii- nation of the femoral artery, where it divides into several filaments which constitute a pleoeus by their communication with other nerves. One of these filaments communicates with the descending branch of the obturator nerve, another with the long saphenous nerve, and two or three are distributed to the integument of the internal and posterior aspect of the thigh. The Long saphenous nerve (n. cutaneus intemus longus) inclines inwards to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and entering the sheath, accompanies the femoral artery to the aponeurotic canal formed by the adductor longus and vastus intemus muscles. It then cpiits theOBTURATOR NERVE. 477 artery, and, passing between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis, descends along the inner side of the leg with the internal saphenous vein, crosses in front of the inner ankle, and is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the foot as far as the great toe. The internal saphenous nerve receives from the obturator nerve two branches of communication, one near its upper part, which passes through the angle of bifurcation of the femoral artery, and the other at the internal condyle. The branches which it gives off in its course are, a femoral cutaneous bra?wJt, at about the middle of the thigh, distributed to the integument of the inner and posterior aspect of the limb, and communicating with other cutaneous filaments from the saphenous below the knee ; a tibial cutaneous branch proceeding from the nerve a little above the internal condyle, passing between the sartorius and gracilis, and descending the inner aspect of the leg to the ankle; an. articular branch, oi small size, proceeding from the nerve, while in the aponeurotic canal of the femoral artery, and passing directly to the knee-joint, to supply the synovial membrane ; an ante- rior cutaneous branch proceeding from the saphenous at the inner con- dyle, perforating the sartorius, and dividing into a number of filaments which supply the integument over the patella and around the joint, and the integument of the front and outer aspect of the leg as far as the ankle ; lastly, cutaneous filaments below the knee to supply the inner side and front of the leg and foot, and articular branches to the ankle-joint. The Obturator nerve is formed by a branch from the third, and another from the fourth lumbar nerve. It passes do^vnwards among the fibres of the psoas muscle, through the angle of bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, and along the inner border of the brim of the pelvis, to the obturator foramen, where it joins the obturator artery. Having escaped from the pelvis, it gives off two small twigs to the obtmntor extemus muscle, and divides into four branches, three ante- rior, which pass in front of the adductor brevis, supplying that mus- cle, the pectineus, the adductor longus, and the gracilis ; and a poste- rior branch, which passes downwards behind the adductor brevis, and ’ ramifies in the adductor magnus. From the branch which supplies the adductor brevis, a communir eating filament passes outwards through the angle of bifurcation of the I femoral vessels to unite with the long saphenous nerve. From the branch to the adductor longus a long cutaneous nerve proceeds, which issues firom beneath the inferior border of that muscle, sends filaments of communication to the plexus of the short saphenous nerve, and II descends to the inner side of the knee, where it pierces the fascia and . communicates with the long saphenous nerve. It is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the leg. From the posterior branch an articular branch is given off which pierces the adductor magnus muscle, accompanies the popliteal artery, and is distributed to the h synovial membrane of the knee-joint on its posterior aspect.478 SACRAL NERVES.—SACRAL I’LE.XUS. The Lumuo-sacral nerve.—The anterior division of the fiftli lumbar nerve, conjoined with a branch from the fourth, constitutes the lumbo-sacral nerve, which descends over the base of tlie sacrum into the pelvis, and assists in forming the sacral plexus. sacral nerves. There are six pairs of sacral nerves ; the first four escape from the vertebral canal through the sacral foramina, and the last two between the sacrum and coccyx. The po.sterior sacral nerves are very small and diminish in size from above downwards ; they communicate with each other immediately after their escape from the posterior sacral foramina, and divide into external and internal branches. The ex- ternal branches pierce the gluteus maximus, to which they give fila- ments, and are distributed to the integument of the posterior part of the gluteal region (n. cutanei clunium posteriores). The internal sup- ply the integument over the sacriun and coccyx. The anterior sacral nerves diminish in size from above downwards; the first is large, and unites with the lumbo-sacral nerve; the second, of equal size, unites with the preceding ; the third, which is scarcely one-fourth so large as the second, also joins with the preceding nerves in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth anterior sacral nerve is about one-third the size of the preceding sacral nerve ; it divides into several branches, one of which is sent to the sacral plexus, a second to join the fifth sacral nerve, a third to the viscera of the pelvis commu- nicating with the hypogastric plexus, and a fourth to the coccygeus muscle, and to the integument around the anus. The fifth anterior sacral nerve presents about half the size of the fourth ; it divides into two branches, one of which commimicates with the fourth, the other with the sixth. The siocth sacral nerve (coccygeal) is very small; it gives off an ascending filament which is continuous with the commu- nicating branch of the fifth, and a descending filament which passes downwards by the side of the coccyx, and traverses the fibres of the great sacro-ischiatic ligament to be distributed to the gluteus maximus and to the integument. All the anterior sacral nerves receive branches from the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic at their emergence firom the sacral foramina. SACRAL PLEXUS. The Sacral plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral, and by the ante- rior branches of the four upper sacral nerves. The plexus is tri- angular in form, the base corresponding with the whole length of the sacrum, and the apex with the lower part of the great ischiatic fora- men. It is in relation behind with the pyriformis muscle and in fi'ont wth the pelvic fascia, which latter separates it from the branches of the internal iliac artery, and from the viscera of the pelvis.GLUTEAL NERVE. 479 The Branches of the sacral plexus are divisible into internal and ex- ternal; they may be thus arranged :— The Visceral nerves are three or four large branches which are de- rived from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves: they ascend upon the side of the rectum and bladder; in the female upon the side of the rectum, the vagina, the uterus, and the bladder; and interlace with the branches of the hypogastric plexus, sending in their course numerous filaments to the pelvic viscera. The MusciUar branches given off within the pelvis are one or two twigs to the levator ani; an obturator branch, which curves around the spine of the ischium to reach the internal surface of the obturator intemus muscle; a coccygeal branch; and an hmmorrhoidal nerve, which passes through the two ischiatic openings and descends to the termination of the rectum to supply the sphincter and the integument around the anus. The iMuscular branches supplied by the sacral plexus externally to the pelvis are, a branch to the pyriformis; a branch to the gemellus superior; and a branch of moderate size, which descends between the gemelli muscles and the ischium, and is distributed to the gemellus inferior, the quadratus femoris, and the capsule of the hip-joint. The Gluteal nerve (superior gluteal) is a branch of the lumbo- sacral ; it passes out of the pelvis with the gluteal artery, through the . great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and divides into a superior and an infe- : rior branch. The superior branch follows the direction of the superior cun'ed line of the ilium, accompanying the deep superior branch of ; the gluteal artery, and sending filaments to the gluteus medius and ; minimus. The inferior passes obliquely downwards and forwards [■' between the gluteus medius and minimus, distributing numerous fila- 1 ments to both, and terminates in the tensor vaginae femoris muscle. The Internal pudic nerve arises from the lower part of the - sacral plexus, passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic If foramen below the pyriformis muscle, and takes the course of the I internal pudic arterj% While situated beneath the obturator fascia I it lies below that vessel and divides into a superior and an inferior I branch. I The Superior nerve (dorsalis penis) ascends along the posterior I surface of the ramus of the ischium, pierces the deep perineal fascia L .ind accompanies the arteria dorsalis penis to the glans, to which it is Internal. Visceral, IMuscular. External. Muscular, Gluteal, Internal pudic. Lesser ischiatic. Greater ischiatic.480 GREAT ISCHIATIC NERVE. distributed. At the root of the penis this nerve gives off a cutaneous branch which runs along the side of the organ, gives filaments to the corpus cavernosuni, and with its fellow of the opposite side supplies the integument of the upper two-thirds of the penis and prepuce. The Inferior or perineal rwrve pursues the course of the internal pudic artery in the perineum and sends off three principal branches, an external perineal branchy which ascends upon the outer side of the crus penis, and supplies the scrotum; a superjvrial perineal branch, which accompanies the artery of that name and distributes filaments to the scrotum, to the integument of the under part of the penis and to the prepuce; and, thirdly, the bulbo-urethral branch, which sends twigs to the sphincter ani, transversus perinei, and accelerator urinrn, and terminates by ramifying in the corpus spongiosum. In the female the internal pudic nen-e is distributed to the parts analogous to those of the male. The superior branch supplies the clitoris; and the inferior the vulva and parts in the perineum. The Lesser ischiatic nerve passps out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, and divides into muscular and cutaneous branches. The muscular branches, infe- rior gluteal, are distributed to the gluteus maximus; some ascending in the substance of that muscle to its upper border, and others de- scending. The cutaneous branches are, several ascending filaments to the integument over the gluteus maximus (n. cutanei clunium inferio- res), perineal cutaneous, and middle posterior cutaneous. The Perineal cutaneous nerve (pudendalis longus inferior), curves around the tuberosity of the ischium and ascends in a direction paral- lel with the ramus of the ischium and os pubis to the scrotum, where it communicates with the superficial perineal nerve, and divides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch passes downwards on the inner side of the testis to the scrotum ; the external branch on its outer side, and both terminate in the integument of the under bor- der of the penis. The Middle posterior cutaneous nerve crosses the tuberosity of the ischium and pierces the deep fascia at the lower border of the gluteus maximus. It then passes downwards along the middle of the poste- rior aspect of the thigh and of the popliteal region, and is distributed to the integument as far as the middle of the calf of the leg. In its coimse the nerve gives off several cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner and outer side of the thigh, and in the popliteal region a communicating branch which pierces the fascia of the leg and unites with the external saphenous nerve. The Great ischiatic nerve is the largest nervous cord in the body; it is formed by the sacral plexus, or rather is a prolongation of the plexus, and at its exit from the great sacro-ischiatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle measures three quarters of an inch in breadth. It descends through the middle of the space between the481 POPLITEAL NERVE. trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, and along the posterior part of the thigh to about its lower third, where it divides into two lanje terminal branches, popliteal and peroneal. This division some- times takes place at the plexus, and the two nerves descend together side by side; occasionally they are separated at their commencement by a part or by the whole of the pyrifomiis muscle. The nerve in its course down the thigh rests upon the gemellus superior, tendon of the obturator intemus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus, and is covered in by the gluteus maximus, biceps, semiten- dinosus, and semimembranosus. The Branches of the great ischiatic nerve, previously to its division, are, muscidar and articular. The 'tmiscular branches are given off from the upper part of the nerve and supply both heads of the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and adductor magnus. The ar- ticular branch descends to the upper part of the external condyle of the femur, and divides into filaments which are distributed to the fibrous capsule and to the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. The Popliteal nerve passes through the middle of the popliteal space, from the division of the great ischiatic nerve to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, accompanies the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial nerve. It is superficial in the whole of its course, and lies externally to the vein and arter)'. The Branches of the popliteal nerve are, muscular or sural, articular, and a cutaneous branch, the communicans poplitei. The Muscular branches, of considerable size, and four or five in number, are distributed to the two heads of the gastrocnemius, to the soleus, plantaris, and popliteus. The Articular nerve pierces the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the interior of the knee-joint. It usually sends a twig also to the popliteus muscle. The Communicans poplitei (communicans tibialis) is a large nerve which arises from the popliteal at about the middle of its course, and descends between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, and along the groove formed by the two bellies of that muscle. At a variable dis- tance below the articulation of the knee it receives a large branch, the communicans peronei, from the peroneal nerve, and the two together constitute the external saphenous nerve. The External saphenous nerve pierces the deep fascia below the I fleshy part of the gastrocnemius muscle, and continues its course < down the leg, lying along the outer border of the tendo Achillis and i by the side of the external saphenous vein which it accompanies to I the foot. At the lower part of the leg it winds around the outer I malleolus, and is distributed to the outer side of the foot and little t toe, communicating with the external peroneal cutaneous nerve, and I sending numerous filaments to the integument of the heel and sole of tthe foot. I I482 POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE. 1 he POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE is Continued iilong the posterior aspect of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the posterior part of the inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar nerve. In the upper part of its course it lies to the outer side of the posterior tibial artery; it then becomes placed superficially to that vessel, and at the ankle is again situated to its outer side; in the lower third of the leg it lies parallel with the inner border of the tendo Achillis. The Branches of the posterior tibial nerve are three or four musetdar twigs to the deep muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg, the branch to the flexor longus pollicis accompanies the fibular artery; one or two filaments which entwine around the artery and then terminate in the integument ;* and two or three plantar cutaneous branches which pass downwards upon the inner side of the os calcis and are distributed to the integument of the heel. The Internal plantar nerve, larger than the external, crosses the posterior tibial vessels to enter the sole of the foot, and becomes placed between the adductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum; it then enters the sheath of the latter muscle, and divides opposite the bases of the metatarsal bones into three digital branches; one to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toe; the second the adjacent sides of the second and third toe ; and the third the corresponding sides of the third and fourth toe. This distribution is precisely similar to that of the digital branches of the median nerve. In its course the internal plantar nerve gives off cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner side and sole of the foot; muscular branches to the muscles forming the inner and middle group of the sole ; a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe; and arti- cular branches to the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The External plantar nerve, the smaller of the two, follows the course of the external plantar artery to the outer border of the inusculus accessorius, beneath which it sends several branches to supply the adductor pollicis and the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bojies. It then gives branches to the integument of the outer border and sole of the foot, and sends forward two digital branches to supply the little toe and half the next. The Peroneal nerve is one half smaller than the popliteal; it passes downwards by the side of the tendon of the biceps, crossing the inner head of the gastrocnemius and the origin of the soleus, to the neck of the fibula, where it pierces the origin of the peroneus longus * It is extremely interesting in a physiological point of view, to observe the mode of distribution of these filaments. I have traced them in relation with several, and-1 have no doubt that they exist in connection with all the superfi- cial arteries. They seem to be the direct momtors to the arterj' of the presence or approach of danger.ANTERIOR TIBIAE NERVE. 483 muscle, and divides into two branches, the anterior tibial and musculo- cutaneous. The Branches of the peroneal nerve previously to its division are, the coramunicans peronei, cutaneous, articular, and muscular. The com- municans peronei, much smaller than the communicans poplitei, crosses the external head of the gastrocnemius to the middle of the leg. It there sends a branch to join the commtmicans poplitei and constitute the external saphenous nerve, and descends, very much reduced in size, with the external saphenous vein to the side of the external ankle, to which and to the integument of the heel it distributes fila- ments. The cutaneous branch passes down the outer side of the leg, supplying the integument. The articular is a small branch distributed to the knee-joint. The muscular branches are twigs to the short head of the biceps, peroneus longus and tibialis anticus. The Anterior tibial nerve commences at the bifimcation of the peroneal upon the head of the fibula, and passes beneath the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum, to reach the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, just as that vessel has emerged through the open- ing in the interosseous membrane. It descends the anterior aspect of the leg with the artery; ljung at first to its outer side, then in front of it, and near the ankle becoming again placed to its outer side. Reaching the ankle it passes beneath the annular ligament; accompa- nies the dorsalis pedis artery, supplies the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, and communicates with the internal peroneal cutane- ous nerve. The Branches given off by the anterior tibial nerve are, muscular to the muscles in its course, and on the foot a tarsal branch which passes beneath the extensor brevis digitorum and distributes filaments to the interossei muscles and to the articulations of the tarsus and meta- tarsus. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve passes downwards in the direction of the fibula, in the substance of the peroneus longus; it then passes forwards to get between the peroneus longus and brevis, and at the lower third of the leg pierces the deep fascia, and divides into two . peroneal cutaneous branches. In its course it gives off several branches ! to the peronei muscles. The Peroneal cutaneous nerves pass in front of the ankle-joint, and ; are distributed to the integument of the foot and toes; the external : nerve supplying three toes and a half, and the internal, one and a half. They communicate with the saphenous and anterior tibial nerves. The f external saphenous nerve frequently supplies the fifth toe and the ad- jacent side of the fourth.484 SYMPATHETIC NERVES. The Sympathetic system consists of a series of ganglia, extending along each side of the vertebral column from the head to the coccyx, communicating with all the other nerves of the body, and distributing branches to all the internal organs and viscera. It communicates with the other nerves immediately at their exit from the cranium and vertebral canal. The fourtli and sixth nerves, however, form an exception to this rule; for with these it unites in the cavernous sinus; and with the olfactory, optic, and auditory, at their ultimate expansions. The branches of distribution accompany the arteries which supply the different organs, and form communications around them, which are called plexuses, and take the name of the artery with which they are associated; thus we have the mesenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, splenic plexus, &c. All the internal organs of the head, neck, and trunk are supplied with branches from the sympathetic, and some of them ex- clusively; hence it is denominated the nerve of organic life. It is called the ganglionic nerve from the circumstance of being con- stituted of a number of ganglia; and from the constant disposition which it evinces in its distribution, to communicate and form small knots or ganglia. There are five sympathetic ganglia in the head; viz., the ganglion of Ribes; the ciliary or lenticular; the spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s ; the otic, or Arnold’s; and the submaxillary: three in the neck ; superior, middle, and inferior; twelve in the dorsal region; four in the lumbar region ; and four or five in the sacral region. Each ganglion may be considered as a distinct centre, from which branches are given off in four different directions, viz., superior or as- cending, to communicate with the ganglion above ; infenor or descend- ing, to communicate with the ganglion below; external, to communicate with the spinal nerves; and internal, to communicate with the sympa- thetic filaments of the opposite side, and to be distributed to the viscera.

The Ganglion of Rises is a small ganglion situated upon the anterior communicating artery, and formed by the union of the sympa- thetic filaments, which accompany the ramifications of the two anterior cerebral arteries.

The Ciliary ganglion {lenticular) is a small quadrangular and flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve Fig. 156.*406 SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. and the external rectus muscle; it is in close contact with the optic nerve, and is surrounded by adipose tissue, which renders its dissection somewhat difficult. Its hrandhes of distribution are the ciliary, which arise from its an- terior angles in two groups: tlie upper group, consisting of about four filaments; and the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into a number of filaments which pierce the sclerotic around the optic nerve, and supply the tunics of the eye-ball. A small filament is said, by Tiedemann, to ac- company the arteria centralis retinae into the centre of the globe of the eye. Its branches of communication are three, one, the long root, which proceeds from the posterior superior angle to the nacal branch of the ophthalmic nerve; a short thick branch, the short root, from the pos- terior inferior angle to the inferior division of the third nerve; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, which passes backwards to the cavernous sinus, and communicates with the carotid plexus. Occa- sionally the ciliary ganglion receives also a filament of communication (middle root) from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and it sometimes sends a twig to the abducens nerve. The Spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel’s) the largest of the cranial ganglia of the sympathetic, is very variable in its dimensions. It is situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa. Its branches are divisible into four groups ; ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. The branches of distribution are the internal and the descending. The internal branches are the nasal and the naso-palatine. The or spheno-palatine nerves, four or five in number, enter the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the superior meatus, and superior and middle spongy bones. Besides these, several branches issue through small openings in the palate and sphenoid bone, and supply the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx and the Eustachian tube. The naso-palatine nerve (Scarpa) enters the nasal fossa with the nasal nerves, and crosses the roof of the nares to reach the septum, to which it gives several filaments. It then curves do^vnwards and forwards to the naso-palatine canal, and enters the anterior palatine canal, where it joins with its fellow of the opposite side, and receives filaments from the anterior dental and palatine nerves. By this junction an enlarge- ment is formed, the naso-palatine ganglion (Cloquet’s), which distributes filaments to the mucous membrane of the palate, immediately behind the incisor teeth. The descending branches are the three palatine nerves, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior palatine nerve, the largest of the three, descends from the ganglion through the posterior palatine canal, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen. It then passes forwards in the substance487 OTIC GANGLION. of the hard palate to which it is distributed, and communicates with the naso-palatine ganglion and with its branches. While in the pos- terior palatine canal, this nerve gives off several branches, which enter the nose through openings in the palate bone, and are distributed to the middle and inferior meatus, the inferior spongy bone, and the antrum. The middle palatine nerve descends through the same canal to the posterior palatine foramen, and distributes branches to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. The posterior palatine nerve, the smallest of the three, quits the other nerves to enter a distinct canal, from which it emerges by a se- parate opening behind the posterior palatine foramen. It is distributed to the hard palate and gums near the point of its emergence, and also to the tonsil and soft palate. The branches of communication are the ascending and the posterior. The ascending branches are, one or two to join the superior maxillary nerve ; one to the abducens nerve ; one to the ciliary ganglion con- stituting its middle root; and occasionally two filaments to the optic nerve within the orbit. The posterior branch is the Vidian or ptery- goid nerve. The Vidian * nerve passes directly backwards from tlie spheno- palatine ganglion, through the pterygoid or Vidian canal, to the fora- men lacerum basis cranii, where it divides into two branches, the carotid and petrosal. The carotid branch (n. fpetrosus profundus) crosses the foramen lacerum, suirounded by the ligamentous substance which closes that opening, and enters the carotid canal by several filaments, to join the carotid plexus. The petrosal branch (n. petrosus auperficialis major) enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum basis cranii, piercing the ligamentous substance of the latter, and passes backwards beneath the Gasserian ganglion and dura mater, embedded in a groove upon the anterior surface of the petrous bone, to the hiatus Fallopii. In the hiatus Fallopii the petrosal branch of the Vidian receives a twig from Jacobson’s nerve, and terminates in the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. While in the pterygoid canal, the Vidian nerve sends off a minute branch which passes through an opening in the sphenoid bone and joins the otic ganglion. The Otic ganglion (Arnold’s)+ is a small oval-shaped and flat- tened ganglion, which lies against the inner surface of the inferior maxillarj' nerve, immediately below the foramen ovale ; it is in relor tion, externally, with the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve, just at the point of union of the motor root; internally it rests against the • Gnido Guidi, latinised into Vidus Vidius, was professor of anatomy and medicine in the College of France in 1542.

It is closelj' adlierent to tlie internal pterygoid nerve, and appears like a swelling upon that branch. The branches of the otic ganglion are seven in number ; two of dis- tribution, and five of communication. The branches of distribution are, a small filament to the tensor tym- pani muscle, and one to the tensor palati muscle ; the latter is usually derived from the internal pterygoid nerve, at the point where that nerve is embraced by the ganglion. The branches of communication are, two or three filaments to the outer portion of the inferior maxillary nerve ; one or two filaments to the auricular nerve ; a filament to the chorda tympani ; filaments to the arteria meningea media to communicate with the nervi modes; a filament which enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum with the arteria meningea media, and accompanies the nervus petrosus superficialis minor to the hiatus Fallopii, Avhere it joins the intume- scentia gangliformis of the facial nerve; a filament which enters the cranium through a small canal behind the foramen rotundum to join the Gasserian ganglion; a filament which enters a small canal near the foramen ovale to communicate with the Vidian nerve ; and the nervus petrosus superficialis minor. The latter nerve ascends from the ganglion to a small canal situated between the foramen ovale and foramen spinosum, and passes backwards on the petrous bone to the hiatus Fallopii, where it divides into two filaments. One of these filaments enters the hiatus and joins the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial; the other passes to a minute foramen nearer the base of the petrous bone, and enters the tympanum, where it communicates \vith a branch of Jacobson’s nerve. The Submaxillary ganglion is a small round or triangular ganglion situated on the submaxillary gland, in close relation with the gustatory nerve, and near the posterior border of the mylo-hyoideus muscle. Its branches of distribution, six or eight in number, divide into man}' filaments, which supply the side of the tongue, the submaxiUary and sublingual glands, and Wharton’s duct. Its branches of communication are, two or three from and to the gustatory nerve ; one from the chorda tympani ; two or three which form a plexus with branches of the hypoglossal nerve; and one or two filaments which pass to the facial artery, and communicate with the nervi molles from the cervical portion of the s}’mpathetic. Carotid plexus.—The ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion enters the carotid canal ivith the internal carotid artery, and divides into two branches, which form several loops of communication with each other around the artery. These branches, together with those derived from the petrosal branch of the Vidian, constitute the489 CERVICAL GANGLIA. carotid ple.vus. They also fomi frequently a small gangliform swelling on the under part of the artery, which is called the carotid ganglion. The latter, however, is not constant. The continuation of the carotid plexus onwards with the ai’tery by the side of the sella turcica, is called the cavernous plexus. The carotid plexus is the centre of communication between all the cranial ganglia, and, being derived from the superior cervical ganglion, between the cranial g<inglia and those of the trunk ; it also com- municates with the greater part of the cerebral nerves, and distributes filaments with each of the branches of the internal carotid, which accompany those branches in all their ramifications. Thus, the Ganglion of Ribes is formed by the union of the filaments which accompany the anterior cerebral arteries, and which meet on the anterior communicating artery. The ciliary ganglion communi- cates with the plexus by means of the long branch which is sent back to join it in the cavernous sinus. The spheno-palatine., and with it the naso-pulaiine ganglion, joins the plexus by means of the carotid branch of the Vidian. The submaxillary ganglion is brought into connection with it by means of the otic ganglion, and the otic ganglion by means of the tympanic nerve and the Vidian. It communicates with the third nerve in the cavernous sinus, and through the cUiary ganglion; frequently with the fourth in the forma- tion of the nerve of the tentorium; with the Gasserian ganglion; with the ophthalmic division of the fifth in the cavernous sinus, and by means of the ciliary ganglion ; with the superior maxillary, through the spheno-palatine ganghon; and with the inferior maxillary, through the otic ganglion. It sends two branches directly to the sixth nerve, which unite * with it as it crosses the cavernous sinus ; it communi- cates with the facial and auditory nerves, through the medium of the petrosal branch of the Vidian ; and with the glosso-pharyngeal by means of two filaments to the tympanic nerve. CERVICAL GANGLIA. The Superior cervical ganglion is long and fusiform, of a greyish colour, smooth, and of considerable thickness, extending from within an inch of the carotid foramen in the petrous bone to opposite the lower border of the third cervical vertebra. It is in relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein ; and, behind, with the rectus anticus major muscle. Its branches, like those of all the sympathetic ganglia in the trank, are divisible into superior, inferior, external, .and internal; to which may be added, as proper to this ganglion, anterior. The superior (carotid nerve) is a single branch which ascends by • Panizza, in his “ Experimental Researches on the Nerves,’ denies this communication, and states veiy vaguely that “ they are merely lost and^ en- twined around it.”—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Januaiy 1836.CERVICAL GANGLIA. 490 the^ide of the internal carotid, and divides into two branches ; one lying to the outer, the other to the inner side of that vessel. The two brandies enter the carotid canal, and by tlieir communications with each other and with the petrosal branch of the Vidian, constitute the carotid jdcxus. The inferior or descending branch, sometimes two, is the cord of communication with the middle cervical ganglion. The external branches are numerous, and may be divided into two sets: those which communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo- gastric, and hj^oglossal nerves ; and those which communicate with the first three cervical nerves. The internal branches are three in,number : pharyngeal, to assist in forming the pharyngeal plexus ; laryngeal, to join the superior larjii- geal nerve and its branches ; and the superior cardiac nerve, or nervus superficialis cordis. The anterior branches accompany the external carotid arterj’’ with its branches, around which they form intricate plexuses, and here and there small ganglia; they are called, from the softness of their texture, nervi molles, and from their reddish hue, nervi submfi. The Middle cervical ganglion (thyroid ganglion) is of small size, and sometimes altogether wanting. It is situated opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, and rests against the inferior thyroid arterj'. This relation is so constant, as to have induced Haller to name it the \ “ thyroid ganglion.” Its superior branch, or branches, ascend to communicate with the superior cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend to join the inferior cervical ganglion ; one of these frequently passes in front of the subclavian artery, the other behind it. Its external branches communicate with the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. Its internal branches are, filaments which accompany the inferior thyroid artery, the inferior thyroid plexus ; and the middle cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus magnus. The Inferior cervical ganglion (vertebral ganglion) is much larger than the preceding, and is constant in its existence. It is of a semi- lunar form, and is situated upon the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, immediately behind the vertebral artery: hence its title to the designation ’•'‘vertebral ganglion." Its superior branches communicare with the middle cervical gan- glion. The inferior branches pass some before and some behind the sul> clavian artery, to join the first thoracic ganglion. The external branches consist of two sets ; one which communicates with the sixth, seventh, and eighth cerHcal, and first dorsal nen-e, and one which accompanies the vertebral artery along the vertebral491 CARDIAC NERVES. canal, forming the vertebral plexus. This plexus sends filaments to all the branches given off by the artery, and communicates in the cranium with the filaments of the carotid plexus accompanying the branches of the internal carotid artery. The internal branch is the. inferior cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus minor. Cardiac nerves.*—The superior cardiac nerve (ne?'vus superfici- alis cordis) arises from the lower part of the superior cervical ganglion; it descends the neck behind the common carotid artery and parallel with the trachea, crosses the inferior thyroid artery, and running by the side of the recurrent laijTigeal nerve for a short distance, passes behind the arteria innominata to the concavity of the arch of the aorta, where it joins the cardiac ganglion. In its course it receives branches firom the pneumogastric nerve, and sends filaments to the thyroid gland and trachea. The Muldle cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus magnus) proceeds from /fthe middle cardiac ganglion, or, in its absence, from the cord of com- mimication between the superior and inferior ganglia. It is the largest of the three nerves, and lies nearly parallel with the recurrent laryn- geal. At the root of the neck it divides into several branches, which pass some before and some behind the subclavian artery; it communi- cates with the superior and inferior cardiac, and with the pneumogas- tric and recurrent nerves, and descends to the bifurcation of the trachea, to join the great cardiac plexus. The Inferior cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical ganglion, communicates freely with the recurrent larjm- geal and middle cardiac nerve, and descends to the front of the bifur- cation of the trachea, to join the great cardiac pleoeus. The Cardiac ganglion is a ganglionic enlargement of variable size, situated beneath the arch of the aorta, to the right side of the ligament of the ductus arteriosus. It receives the superior cardiac nerves of op- posite sides of the neck and a branch from the pneumogastric, and gives off numerous branches to the cardiac plexuses. The Great cardiac plexus is situated upon the bifurcation of the trachea, above the right pulmonary artery, and behind the arch of the aorta. It is formed by the convergence of the middle and inferior car- diac nerves, and by branches from the pneumogastric, descendens noni, and first thoracic ganglion. The Anterior cardiac plexus is situated in front of the ascending aorta, near its origin. It is formed by the communications of filaments that proceed from three different sources, namely, from the superior cardiac nerves, crossing the arch of the aorta; from the cardiac ganglion, beneath the arch; and from the great cardiac plexus, passing between the ascending aorta and the right auricle. The anterior cardiac plexus • There is no constancy with regard to the origin and course of these nerves; : therefore the student must not be disappointed in finding the description in . discord with his dissection.492 THORACIC GANGLIA. supplies the anterior aspect of the heart, distributing numerous fila- ments witli the left coronary artery, which form the anterior coronary plexus. The Posterior cardiac plexus is formed by numerous branches from the great cardiac plexus, and is situated on the posterior part of the ascending aorta, near its origin. It divides into two sets of branches: one set accompanying the right coronary artery in the auriculo-ventri- cular sulcus; the other set joining the artery on the posterior aspect of the heart. They both together constitute the posterior coronary plexus. The great cardiac plexus likewise gives branches to the auricles of the heart, and others to assist in forming the anterior and jxisterior pulmonary plexuses. THORACIC GANGLIA. The Thoracic ganglia are twelve in number on each side. They are flattened and triangular, or irregular in form, and present the peculiar grey colour and pearly lustre of the other sympathetic ganglia; they rest against the heads of the ribs, and are covered in by the pleura costalis. The first two ganglia and the last are usually the largest. Their branches are, superior, inferior, external, and internal. The superior and inferior are prolongations of the substance of the ganglia rather than branches; the former to communicate with the ganglion above, the latter with that below. The external branches, two or three in number, communicate with both roots of each of the spinal nerves. The internal branches oi the five upper ganglia sxe,ptdmonary to]om. the pulmonar}'' plexuses, oesophageal to the oesophageal plexus, and aortic to the thoracic aorta and its branches; the first thoracic ganglion moreover sends branches to the cardiac plexuses. The branches of the lower ganglia are aortic, and several large cords which unite to form the two splanchnic nerves. The Great splanchnic nerve arises from the sixth dorsal ganglion, and receives branches from the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, which augment it to a nerve of considerable size. It descends in front of the vertebral column, within the posterior mediastinum, pierces the dia- phragm immediately to the outer side of each crus, and terminates in the semilunar ganglion. The Lesser splanchnic nerve {renaV) is formed by filaments from the tenth, eleventh, and sometimes from the twelfth dorsal ganglion. It pierces the diaphragm, and descends to join the renal plexus. The Semilunar ganglion is a large, irregular gangliform body, pierced by numerous openings, and appearing like the aggregation of a number of smaller ganglia, having spaces between them. It is situ- ated by the side of the coeliac axis, and communicates vdth the gan- glion of the opposite side, both above and below that trunk, so as to493 LUMBAR GANGLIA. fonn a gangliform circle, from which branches pass off in all directions, like rays from a centre. Hence the entire circle has been named the solar plexus. The Solar plexus receives the great splanchnic nerves ; part of the lesser splanchnic nerves; the termination of the right pneumogastric nerve; some branches from the right phrenic nerve; and sometimes one or two filaments from tlie left. It sends forth numerous filaments which accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches given off by the abdominal aorta. Thus, we have, derived from the solar plexus, the— Phrenic plexuses, Gastric plexus. Hepatic plexus. Splenic plexus, Supra-renal plexuses, Renal plexuses, Superior mesenteric plexus, Spennatic plexuses, Inferior mesenteric plexus. The Renal pleocus is formed chiefly by the lesser splanchnic nerve, but receives many filaments from the solar plexus. The Spermatic plexus is formed principally by the renal plexus. The Inferior mesenteric plexus receives filaments from the aortic plexus. LUMBAR GANGLIA. The Lumbar ganglia, four in number at each side, of a pearly grey colour and fusiform shape, are situated on the anterior part of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrie. The superior and inferior branches of the lumbar ganglia are branches of communication with the ganglion above and below, as in the dorsal region. The external branches, two or three in number, communicate with the lumbar nerves. The internal branches consist of two sets; of which the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and form around that trunk a plexiform interlacement, which constitutes the lumbar aortic pleams ; - the lower branches cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the : promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus. The Lumbar aortic plexus is formed by branches from the lumbar ganglia, and receives filaments from the solar and superior mesenteric plexuses. It sends filaments to the inferior mesenteric plexus, and • terminates in the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric pleams is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two494 SACllAL GANGLIA. common iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral por tions, which communicate with branches from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves. It distributes branches to all the viscera of the pelvis, and sends filaments which accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. SACRAL GANGLIA. The Sacral ganglia are four or five in number on each side. They are situated upon the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connection, although much smaller in size. The superior and inferior branches communicate with the ganglia above and below. The external branches communicate 'with the sacral nerves. The internal branches communicate very freely with the lateral divisions of the hypogastric plexus, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos. This ganglion resembles in its position and function the ganglion of Ribes, serving to connect the inferior ex- tremity of the sympathetic system, as does the former ganglion its upper extremity. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum.495 CHAPTER IX. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense, the instruments by which the animal frame is brought into relation with surroimding nature, are five in number. Four of these organs are situated within the head : viz. the apparatus of smell, sight, hearing, and taste; and the remaining organ, of touch, is resident in the skin, and distributed over the surface of the bod^'. THE NOSE AND NASAL FOSSiE. The organ of smell consists essentially of two parts : one external, the nose ; the other internal, the nasal fosses. The nose is the triangidar pyramid which projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Superiorly it is connected with the forehead by means of a narrow bridge; inferiorly, it presents two openings, the nostrils, which overhang the mouth, and are so constructed that the odour of aU substances must be received by the nose before they can be introduced within the lips. The septum between the openings of the nostrils is called the columna. Their entrance is guarded by a number of stiff hairs (vibrissce) which project across the openings, and act as a filter in preventing the introduction of foreign substances, such as dust or insects, with the current of air intended for respiration. The anatomical elements of which the nose is composed, are—1. i Integument. 2. Muscles, 3. Bones. 4. Fibro-cartilages. 5. Mucous 1 membrane. 6. Vessels and nerves. 1. The Integument forming the tip (lobulus) and wings (aZ<®) of the : nose is extremely thick and dense, so as to be with difficulty separated fifrom the fibro-cartilage. It is furnished with an abundance of sebi- l-parous follicles, which, by their oily secretion, protect the extremity of i the nose in excessive alternations of temperature. The sebaceous mat- : ter of these follicles becomes of a dark colour upon the surface, from uthe attraction of the carbonaceous matter floating in the atmosphere; bhence the spotted appearance which the tip of the nose presents in i.'large cities. When the integument is firmly compressed, the inspis- sated sebaceous secretion is squeezed out from the follicles, and taking the cylindrical form of their excretory ducts, has the appearance of : small white maggots with black heads.

The Muscles are l)rought into view by reflecting the integument r they are the pyramidalis nasi, compressor nasi, dilatator naris, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and depressor labii superioris aheque nasi. They have been already described with the muscles of the face. 3. The Bones of the nose are, the nasal, and nasal processes of the superior maxillary. 4. The Fihro-cartilages give form and stability to the outwork of the nose, providing, at the same time, by their elasticity, against injuries. They are five in number, namely, the— Fibro-cartilage of the septum. Two lateral fibro-cartilages, Two alar fibro7cartilages. The Fibro-cartilage of the septum, somewhat triangular in form, divides the nose into its two nostrils. It is connected above with the nasal bones and lateral fibro-cartilages; behind, with the ethmoidal septum and vomer ; and below, with the palate processes of the superior maxillary bones. The alar fibro-cartilages and columna move freely upon the fibro-cartilage of the septum, being but loosely con- nected with it by perichondrium. The Lateral fbro-cartilages are also triangular; they are connected, in front, with the fibro-cartilage of the septum ; above, with the nasal bones ; behind, ■with the nasal processes of the supe- rior maxillary bones; and below wdth the alar fibro-cartilages. Alar fibro-cartilages.—Each of these cartilages is curved in such a manner as to correspond wdth the opening of the nostril, to which it forms a kind of rim. The inner portion is loosely con- nected with the same part of the oppo- site cartilage, so as to form the co- lumna. It is expanded and thickened at the point of the nose to constitute the lobe; and on the side forms a curve corresponding wdth the form of the ala. This curve is prolonged dowm- wards and forwards in the direction of the posterior border of the ala by three or four small fibro-cartilaginous plates, which are appendages of the alar fibro-cartilage. cartilage of the septum. 3.

Fig. 157.*NASAL FOSS^. 497 The whole of these fibro-cartilages are connected with each other and to the bones, by perichondrium, which, from its membranous structure, permits of the freedom of motion existing between them. 5. The Mucous membrane, lining the interior of the nose, is con- tinuous with the skin externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossae within. Around the entrance of the nostrils it is pro- vided with numerous vibrissce. 6. I cjise/s and Nerves.—The Arteries of the nose are the lateralis nasi from the facial, and the nasalis septi from the superior coronary. Its Nerves are, the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. NASAL FOSSiE. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasal fossce are two irregular compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded swpe- riorly by the lateral cartilage of the nose, and by the nasal, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones ; inferiorly by the hard palate; and, in the middle line, they are separated from each other by a bony and fibro-cartilagi- nous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossae will be found at page 62. Upon the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three i projecting processes, termed spongy bones. The two superior belong to the ethmoid, the inferior is a separate bone. In the fresh fossae these are covered with mucous membrane, and serve to increase the surface of that membrane by their prominence and convoluted form. The space intervening between the superior and middle spongy bone is the superior meatus ; the space between the middle and inferior the middle meatus; and that between the inferior and the floor of the fossa the inferior meatus. These meatuses are passages which extend from before backwards, and it is in rushing through and amongst these that the atmosphere deposits its odorant particles upon the mucous membrane. There are several openings into the nasal fossae: thus, in the superior meatus . are the openings of the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal cells; in ' the middle the anterior ethmoidal cells, the frontal sinuses, and the : antnun maxillare ; and, in the inferior meatus, the termination of the I nasal duct. In the dried bone there are two additional openings, the * spheno-palatine and the anterior palatine foramen ; the former being f situated in the superior, and the latter in the inferior meatus. The Mucous membrane of the nasal fossae is called pituitary, or . Schneiderian.* The former name being derived from the nature of its * Conrad Victor Schneider, professor of Medicine at Wittenberg. His work, ^ entitled Be Catarrhis, &c. was published in 1661.

It is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane, and may be traced through the openings in the meatuses, into the sphenoidal and eth- moidal cells ; into the frontal sinuses ; into the antrum maxillare; through the nasal duct to the surface of the eye, where it is con- tinuous with the conjunctiva; along the Eustachian tubes into the t}Tnpanum and mastoid cells, to which it forms the lining membrane ; and through the posterior nares into the pharynx and mouth, and thence through the lungs and alimentary canal. The surface of this membrane is furnished with a columnar epithe- lium supporting innumerable vibratile cilia. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the nasal fossae are the an- terior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic artery ; and the spheno-palatine and pterygo-palatine from the internal maxillary. The Nerves are, the olfactory, the spheno-palatine branches from Meckel’s ganglion, and the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The ultimate filaments of the olfactory nerve terminate in papillae. THE EYE, WITH ITS APPENDAGES. The form of the eyeball is that of a sphere, of about one inch in diameter, having the segment of a smaller sphere engrafted upon its anterior surface, which increases its antero-posterior diameter. The axes of the two eyeballs are parallel with each other, but do not correspond with the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards* The optic nerves follow the direction of the orbits, and therefore enter the eyeballs to their nasal side. The Globe of the Eye is composed of tunics, and of refracting media called humours. The tunics are three in number, the 1. Sclerotic and Cornea, 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary processes, 3. Retina and Zonula ciliaris. The humours are also three — Aqueous, Crystalline (lens). Vitreous. First tunic.—The Sclerotic and Cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball, and give it its peculiar form. Four-fifths of the globe are invested by the sclerotic, the remaining fifth by the cornea. The Sclerotic (o-xXjjjos, hard) is a dense fibrous membrane, thicker behind than in front. It is continuous, posteriorly, wth the sheath of the optic nerve, which is derived from the dura mater, and is pierced by that nerve as well as by the ciliary nerves and arteries.TUNICA ALBUGINEA. 499 Anteriorly it presents a bevelled edge which receives the cornea in the same way that a watch-glass is received by the groove in its case. Its anterior surface is covered by a thin tendinous layer, the tunica albuginea, derived from the expansion of the tendons of the four recti muscles. By its posterior surface it gives attachment to the two oblique muscles. The tunica albuginea is covered, for a part of its extent, by the mucous membrane of the front of the eye, the conjunc- tiva; and, by reason of the brilliancy of its whiteness, gives occasion to the common expression, “ the white of the eye.” At the entrance of the optic nerve, the sclerotic forms a thin cribriform lamella {lamina cribrosa), which is pierced by a number of minute openings for the passage of the nervous filaments. One of these openings, larger than the rest, and situated in the centre of the lamella, is the parus ojjticus, through which the arteria centralis retinm enters the eyeball.

In its form it is circular, concavo-convex, and resemhles a watch-glass. It is received by its edge, which is sharp and thin, within the bevelled border of the sclerotic, to which it is very firmly attached, and it is somewhat thicker than the anterior portion of that tunic. When examined from the exterior, its vertical diameter is seen to be about one-sixteenth shorter than the transverse, in consequence of the overlapping above and below, of the margin of the sclerotica ; on the interior, however, its outline is perfectly circular. The cornea is composed of four layers : namely, of the conjunctiva; of the cornea proper, which consists of several thin lamellae connected together by an extremely fine areolar tissue ; of the cornea elastica, a “fine, elastic, and exquisitely transparent membrane, exactly ap- plied to the inner surface of the cornea proper,” and of the lining membrane of the anterior chamber of the eyeball. The cornea elastica is remarkable for its perfect transparency, even when submitted for many days to the action of water or alcohol ; while the cornea proper is rendered opaque by the same immersion. To expose this mem- brane, Dr. Jacob suggests that the eye should be placed in water for six or eight days, and, then, that all the opaque cornea should be removed layer after layer. Another character of the cornea elastica is its great elasticity, which causes it to roll up when divided or tom, in the same manner as the capsule of the lens. The use of this layer, according to Dr. Jacob, is to “ preserve the requisite permanent correct curvature of the flaccid cornea proper.” The opacity of the cornea, produced by pressure on the globe, re- sults from the infiltration of fluid into the areolar tissue connecting its layers. This appearance cannot be produced in a sound living eye. Dissection The sclerotic and cornea are now to be dissected away from the second tunic; this, with care, may be easily performed, the only connections subsisting between them being at the circumference of the iris, the entrance of the optic nerve, and the perforation of the ciliary nerves and arteries. Pinch up a fold of the sclerotic near its anterior circumference, and make a small opening into it, then raise the edge of the tunic, and with a pair of fine scissors, having a probe point, divide the entire circiunference of the sclerotic, and cut it away bit by bit. Then separate it from its attachment around the circum- ference of the iris by a gentle pressure with the edge of the knife. The dissection of the eye must be conducted under water. In the course of this dissection the ciliary nerves and long ciliary arteries will be seen passing forwards between the sclerotic and cho- roid, to be distributed to the iris. Second tunic.—The second tunic of the eyeball is formed b}* the choroid, ciliary ligament, and iris, the ciliary processes being an appen- dage developed from its inner surface.501 CHOROID COAT. The Choroid* is a vascular membrane of a rich chocolate-brown colour upon its external surface, and of a deep black colour within. It is connected to the sclerotic, externally, by an extremely fine areolar tissue, and by nerves and vessels. Internally it is in simple contact with the third tunic of the eye, the retina. It is pierced posteriorly for the passage of the optic nerve, and is connected ante- riorly with the iris, ciliary processes, and with the line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, by a dense white structure, the ciliary liga- merd, which surrounds the circumference of the iris like a ring. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers:—an external or venous layer, which consists principally of veins arranged in a pecu- liar manner: hence they have been named vence vorticosce. The mark- ing on the surface of the membrane produced by these veins resembles Fig. 159. t 3 3 * The word cTioroid has been very much abused in anatomical language; it was originally applied to the membrane of the fcetus called chorion from the Greek word x°p<-or, domicilium, that membrane being, as it were, the abode or receptacle of the foetus. Xopiov comes from to take or receive. Now it so happens that the chorion in the ovum is a vascular membrane of peculiar structure. Hence the term choroid, xopLov elSos, like the chorion, has been used indiscriminately to signify vascular structures, as in the choroid membrane of the eye, the choroid plexus, <fec., and we find Cruveilhier in his work on Anatomy, vol. iii, p. 463, saying in a note, “ Choro'ide est synonyme de vas- cnleuse.” t A dissection of the eyeball, showing its second tunic, and the mode of dis- tribution of the venae vorticosse of the choroid.

It is tliis layer which is connected with the ciliary ligament. The middle or arterial layer {txmica lluyschiarm*) is formed principally by the ramifications of minute arteries. It is reflected inwards at its junction with the ciliary ligament, so as to form the ciliary processes. The internal layer is a delicate membrane {memhrana piymcnii) composed of several laminae of nucleated hexagonal cells, which contain the granules of pigmentum nigrum, and are arranged so as to resemble a tesselated pavement. In animals, the pigmentum nigrum, on the posterior wall of the eyeball, is replaced by a layer of considerable extent, and of metallic brilliancy, called the tapetum. The Ciliary ligament, or circle, is the bond of union between the external and middle tunics of the eyeball, and serves to connect the cornea and sclerotic, at their line of junction, with the iris and external layer of the choroid. It is also the point to which the ciliary nerves and vessels proceed previously to their distribution, and it receives the anterior ciliary arteries through the anterior margin of the sclerotic. A minute vascular canal is situated within the ciliarj* ligament, called the ciliary canal, or the canal of Fontana,t from its disco- verer. i The Iris (iris, a rainbow,) is so named from its variety of colour in \ different individuals; it forms a septum between the anterior and j posterior chambers of the eye, and is pierced somewhat to the nasal I side of its centre by a circular opening, which is called the pupil. By its periphery it is connected with the ciliary ligament, and by its inner circumference forms the margin of the pupil; its anterior surface looks towards the cornea, and the posterior towards the ciliary pro- cesses and lens. The iris is composed of two layers, an anterior or muscular, consist- ing of radiating fibres which converge from the circumference towards the centre, and have the power of dilating the pupil; and circular, which surround the pupil like a sphincter, and by their action produce contraction of its area. The posterior layer is of a deep purple tint, and is thence named uvea, from its resemblance in colour to a ripe grape. The Ciliary processes may be seen in two ways, either by removing the iris from its attachment to the ciliary ligament, when a front view of the processes will be obtained, or by making a transverse section through the globe of the eye, when they may be examined from behind, as in fig. 160. * Ruysch was bom at the Hague in 1638, and was appointed professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665. His whole life was employed in making in- jected preparations, for which he is justly celebrated, and he died at the ad- vanced age of ninety-three years. He came to the conclusion that the body was entirely made up of vessels. t Felix Fontana, an anatomist of Tuscany. His “Description of a New Canal in the Eye,” was published in 1778, in a Letter to the Professor of Ana- tomy in Upsal.CILIARY PROCESSES. THIRD TUNIC. 503 Tlie ciliarj' processes consist of a number of triangular folds, formed apparently by the plaiting of the middle and internal layer of the choroid. According to Zinn, they are about sixty in number, and may be divided into large and small, the latter being situated in the spaces between the former. Their periphery is connected with the ciliarj' ligament, and is continuous with the middle and internal layer of the choroid. The central border is free, and rests against the cir- cumference of the lens. The anterior surface corresponds with the r K I t uvea; the posterior receives the folds of the zonula ciliaris between its processes, and thus establishes a connection between the choroid and the third tunic of the eye. The cibary processes are covered with a thick layer of pigmentum nigrum, which is more abundant upon them, and upon the anterior part of the choroid, than upon the poste- rior part. When the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish coloim. Third tunic.—The third tunic of the eye is the retina, which is 0 prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. \ Dissection.—If, after the preceding dissection, the choroid membrane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina may be seen very distinctly. * The anterior segment of a transverse section of the globe of the eye, seen from within. 1.

The Retina is composed of three laj'ers :— External, or Jacob’s membrane, Middle, Nervous membrane, Internal, Vascular membrane. Jaeoh's membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a mere film when the freshly dissected eye is suspended in water. Examined by the microscope, it is found to be composed of cells having a tesselated arrangement. Dr. Jacob considers it to be a serous mem- brane. The Nervous membrane is the expansion of the optic nerve, and forms a thin semi-transparent bluish-white layer, which envelopes the vitreous humour, and extends forwards to the commencement of the ciliary processes, where it terminates by an abrupt scalloped margin. According to Treviranus, this layer is composed of cylindrical fibres, which proceed from the optic nerve, and, near their termination, bend abruptly inwards, to form the internal papillary layer, which lies in contact with the hyaloid membrane ; each fibre constituting by its ex- tremity a distinct papilla. The Vascular membrane consists of the ramifications of a minute artery, the arteria centralis retime, and its accompanying vein; the artery pierces the optic nerve, and enters the globe of the eye through the porus opticus, in the centre of the lamina cribrosa. This artery may be seen very distinctly by making a transverse section of the eyeball. Its branches are continued anteriorly into the zonula ciliaris. The vascular layer forms distinct sheaths for the nervous papillie, which constitute the inner surface of the retina. In the centre of the posterior part of the globe of the eye the retina presents a circular spot, which is called the foramen of Soemmering;* it is surrounded by a yellow halo, the limbus luteus, and is frequently obscured by an elliptical fold of the retina, which has been regarded as a normal condition of the membrane. The term foramen is misap- plied to this spot, for the vascular layer and the membrana Jacobi are continued across it; the nervous substance alone appearing to be defi- cient. It exists only in animals having the axes of the eyeballs pa- rallel with each other, as man, quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles, and is said to give passage to a small lymphatic vessel. The Zonula ciliaris (zonula of Zinn) 4“ is a thin vascular layer, which connects the anterior margin of the retina with the anterior surface of the lens near its circumference. It presents upon its sur- face a number of small folds corresponding with the ciliary processes, * Samuel Thomas Soemmering is celebrated for the beautiful and accurate plates which accompany his works. The account “De Foramine Centrali Re- tinae Humanae, Limbo Luteo cincto,” was published in 1779, in the Commeti- tationes Soc. Meg. Scient. Gottingensis. t John Gottfried Zinn, professor of Anatomy in Gottingen ; his “ Descriptio Anatomica Oculi Humani,” was published in 1755; with excellent plates. It was republished by Wrisberg in 1780.505 ZONULA CILIARIS.—AQUEOUS HUxMOUR. between which they are received. These processes are arranged in the form of rays around the lens, and the spaces between them ai’C stained by the pigmentum nigrum of the ciliary processes. They derive their vessels from the vascular layer of the retina. The under surface of the zonula is in contact with the hyaloid membrane, and around the lens forms the anterior fluted wall of the canal of Petit. Fig. 161.* The connection between these folds and the ciliary processes may be very easily demonstrated by dividing an eye transversely into two portions, then raising the anterior half, and allowing the vitreous humour to separate from its attachment by its own weight. The folds of the zonula will then be seen to be drawn out from between the folds of the ciliary processes. Humours.—The Aqueous humour is situated in the anterior and 'posterior chambers of the eye; it is a weakly albuminous fluid, having in alkaline reaction, and a specific gravity very little greater than that . <f distilled water. According to Petit, it scai’cely exceeds four or five •puins in weight. The anterior chamler- is the space intervening between the cornea n front, and the iris and pupil behind.

The two chambers are lined by a thin layer, the secreting membrane of the aejueous humour. The Vitreous humour forms the principal bulk of the globe of the eye. It is an albuminous and highly transparent fluid, enclosed in a delicate membrane, the hyaloid. From the inner surface of this mem- brane, numerous thin lamellae are directed inwards, and form compart- ments in which the fluid is contained. According to Hannover, these lamellae have a radiated arrangement, like those on the transverse sec- tion of an orange, and are about 180 in number. In the centre of the viti’eous humour is a tubular canal, through which a minute artery is conducted from the arteria centralis retinae to the capsule of the lens. This vessel is injected without difficulty in the foetus. The Crystallirui humour or lens is situated immediately behind the pupil, and is surrounded by the ciliary processes, which slightly over- lap its margin. It is more convex on the posterior than on the anterior surface, and is embedded in the anterior part of the vitreous humour, from which it is separated by the hyaloid membrane. It is invested by a peculiarly transparent and elastic membrane, the capsule j of the lens, which contains a small quantity of fluid, called liepior : Morgagni,^ and is retained in its place by the attachment of the zonula ciliaris. Dr. Jacob is of opinion that the lens is connected to its capsule by means of areolar tissue, and that the liquor Morgagni is the result of a cadaveric change. The lens consists of concentric layers, of which the external are ! soft, the next firmer, and the central form a hardened nucleus. These ; layers are best demonstrated by boiling, or by immersion in alcohol, ; when they separate easily from each other. Another division of the lens takes place at the same time ; it splits into three triangular segments, which have the sharp edge directed towards the centre, and the base towards the circumference. The concentric lamellae are com- posed of minute parallel fibres, which are united with each other by means of scalloped borders, the convexity on the one border fitting accurately the concave scallop upon the other. Immediately around the circumference of the lens is a triangular canal, the canal of Petit,X a,bout a line and a half in breadth. It is bounded, in front, by the flutings of the zonula cUiaris ; behind, by the hyaloid membrane; and, within, by the border of the lens. The Vessels of the globe of the eye are the long and short, and * Winslow and Lieutaud thought the iris to be in contact with the lens ; it frequently adheres to the capsule of the latter in iritis. The depth of the pos- terior chamber is greater in old than in young persons. t John Baptist Morgagni was born in 1682. He was appointed Professor of Medicine in Bologna, and published the first part of his “Adversaria Anato- raica,” in 1706.

The long ciliarg arteries, two in number, pierce the posterior , part of the scle- rotic, and pass forward on each side, between that membrane and the choroid, to the ciliary ligament, where they divide into two branches, which are distributed to the iris. The short ciliary arteries pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic coat, and are distributed to the middle layer of the choroid membrane. The anterior ciliary are branches of the muscular ai-teries. They enter tlie eye through the anterior part of the sclerotic, and are distributed to the iris. It is the increased number of these latter arteries, in iritis, that gives rise to the peculiar red zone around the circumference of the cornea which accompanies that disease. The arteria centralis retina enters the optic nerve at about half an inch from the globe of the eye, and passing through the porus opticus is distributed upon the inner surface of the retina, forming its vascular layer; one branch pierces the centre of the vitreous humour, and sup- plies the capsule of the lens. The Nerves of the eyeball are, the optic, two ciliary nerves from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the ciliary nerves from the ;ciliar\' ganglion. Obserratims.—The sclerotic is a tunic of protection, and the cornea sa medium for the transmission of light. The choroid supports the vessels destined for the nutrition of the eye, and by its pigmentum nignim absorbs all loose and scattered rays that might confuse the rimage impressed upon the retina. The iris, by means of its powers of expansion and contraction, regulates the quantity of light admitted through the pupil. If the iris be thin, and the rays of light pass •through its substance, they are immediately absorbed by the uvea; and : T that layer be insufficient, they are taken up by the black pigment of ;:he ciliary processes. In Albinoes, where there is an absence of pig- . nentum nigrum, the rays of light traverse the iris, and even the scle- •otic, and so overwhelm the eye with light, that sight is destroyed, xcept in the dimness of evening or at night. In the manufacture of ; ptical instruments care is taken to colour their interior black with the ame object, the absorption of scattered rays. The transparent lamellated cornea and the humours of the eye have :)r their office the refraction of the rays in such proportion as to direct ; le image in the most favourable manner upon the retina. Where ; le refracting medium is too great, as in over convexity of the cornea ad lens, the image falls short of the retina (myopia, near-sightedness); id where it is too little, the image is thrown beyond the nervous embrane (presbyopia, far-sightedness). These conditions are recti- d by the use of spectacles, which provide a differently refracting edium externally to the eye, and thereby correct the transmission ofEYEBROWS. EYELIDS. oon APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. The Appendages of the Eye {tutamina ocidi) are, the eyehrows, eye- lids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, caruncula lachrymalis, and the lachrymal apparatus. The Eyebrows {supercilia') are two projecting arches of integument covered with short thick hairs, which form the upper boundary of the orbits. They are connected beneath with the orbiculares, occipito- frontales, and corrugatores superciliorum muscles ; their use is to shade the eyes from too vivid a light, or protect them from particles of dust and moisture floating over the forehead. The Eyelids {palpehrce) are two valvular layers placed in front of the eye, serving to defend it from injury by their closure. When drawn open, they leave between them an elliptical space, the angles of j which are called canthi. The outer canthus is formed by the meeting i of the two lids at an acute angle. The inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance inwards towards the nose, and a triangular space is left between the lids in this situation, which is called the kicus lachry- malis. At the commencement of the lacus lachrj'malis upon each of the two lids is a small angular projection, the lachrymal papilla or Fig. 162.* * The appendages of the eye. 1.

The eyelids have, entering into their structure, integument, orhicur laris muscle, tarsal cartilages. Meibomian glands, and conjunctiva. The tegumentary areohir tissue of the eyelids is remarkable for its looseness and for the absence of adipose substance ; it is particularly liable to serous infiltration. The fibres of the orbiculai-is muscle cover- ing the eyelids, are extremely thin and pale. The Tarsal cartilages are two thin lamellse of fibro-cartilage about an inch in length, which give form and support to the eyelids. The superior is of a semilunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at its middle, and tapering to each extremity. Its lower border is broad and flat, its upper is thin, and gives attachment to the levator palpebKE and to the fibrous membrane of the lids. The Inferior fibro-cartilage is an elliptical band, narrower than the superior, and situated in the substance of the lower lid. Its upper border is flat, and corresponds with the flat edge of the upper cartilage. The lower is held in its place by the fibrous membrane. Near the inner canthus the tarsal cartilages terminate, at the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, and are attached to the margin of the orbit by the tendo oculi. At their outer extremity they terminate at a short distance firom the angle of the canthus, and are retained in their posi- tion by means of a decussation of the fibrous structure of the broad tarsal ligament, called the external palpebral ligament. The Fibrous membrane of the lids is firmly attached to the perios- teum, around the margin of the orbit, by its circumference, and to the tarsal cartilages by its central margin. It is thick and dense on the outer half of the orbit, but becomes thin to its inner side. Its use is to retain the tarsal cartilages in their place, and give support to the lids ; hence it has been named the broad tarsal ligament. The Meibomian glands* are embedded in the internal surface of the cartilages, and are very distinctly seen on examining the inner aspect of the lids. They have the appearance of parallel strings of pearls, about thirty in number in the upper cartilage, and somewhat fewer in the lower; and open by minute foramina on the edges of the lids. They correspond in length with the breadth of the cartilage, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clustered follicles open ; the latter are so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out upon the margin of the lids. Occasionally an arch is formed between two of them, and produces a very graceful appearance. The edges of the eyelids are furnished with a triple row of long thick hairs, which curve upwards from the upper lid, and downwards from the lower, so that they may not interlace with each other in the closure of the eyelids, and prove an impediment to the opening of the • Henry Meibomius, “de Vasia Palpebrarum Novis,” 1666.olO LACHRYMAX^ APl'AKATUS. eyes. These are tlie eyelashes {cilia), important organs of defence to the sensitive suiTace of so delicate an organ as the eye. The Conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It covers the whole of its anterior surface, and is then reflected upon the lids so as to form their internal layer. The duplicatures formed between the globe of the eye and the lids are called the superior and inferior palpcr hral sinuses, of which the former is much deeper than the inferior. Where it covers the cornea the conjunctiva is very thin and closely adherent, and no vessels can be traced into it. Upon the sclerotica it is thicker and less adherent, but upon the inner surface of the lids is very closely connected, and exceedingly vascular. It is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane and sympathises in its affections, as may be observed in various diseases. From the surface of the eye it may be traced through the lachrjTnal ducts into the lachrymal gland ; along the edges of the lids it is continuous with the mucous lining of the Meibomian glands, and at the inner angle of the eye may be followed through the lachrymal canals into the lachry- mal sac, and thence dorvnwards through the nasal duct into the infe- rior meatus of the nose. The Caruncula lachrymalisis the small reddish body whicli occupies the lacus lachrymalis at the inner canthus of the e3’e. In health it presents a bright pink tint; in sickness it loses its colour and becomes pale. It consists of an assemblage of follicles similar to the IMeibomian glands, embedded in a fibro-cartilaginous tissue, and is the source of the whitish secretion which so constantlj’’ forms at the inner angle of the eye. It is covered with minute hairs which are sometimes so long as to be distinctly visible to the naked eye. Immediately to the outer side of the caruncula is a slight duplicature of the conjunctiva, called plica semilunaris, which contains a minute plate of cartilage, and is the rudiment of the third lid of animals, the membrana nictitans of birds. Vessels and nerves.—The palpebrae are supplied internally with arteries from the ophthalmic, and externally from the facial and transverse facial. Their nerves are branches of the fifth and of the facial. LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. The Lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland Math its excretory ducts; the puncta lachrymalia, and lachr3'mal canals; the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. The Lachrymal gland is situated at the upper and outer angle of the orbit, and consists of two portions, orbital and palpebral. The crrhital portion, about three quarters of an inch in length, is flattened and oval in shape, and occupies the lachr3mal fossa in the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It is in contact superiorl3’- with the perios- teum, with which it is closely connected 1x3^ its upper and convex surface; by its inferior or concave surface it is in relation with theLACHRYMAL CANALS. 511 • globe of the eye, and the superior and external rectus; and by its anterior border with the broad tarsal ligament. By its posterior border it receives its vessels and nerves. The palpebral portion, smaller than the preceding, is situated in the upper eyelid, extending downwards to the superior margin of the tarsal cartilage. It is con- tinuous with the orbital portion above, and is enclosed in an invest- ment of dense fibrous membrane. The secretion of the lachrymal gland is conveyed away by from eight to twelve small ducts which run for a short distance beneath the conjunctiva, and open upon its surface by a series of pores, about one-twentieth of an inch apart, situated in a curved line a little above the upper border of the tarsal cartilage. Lachrymal canals.—The lachrymal canals commence at the minute openings, puncta lachr}Tualia, seen upon the lachrymal papillae of the lids at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymalis, and proceed in- wards to the lachrymal sac, where they terminate beneath a valvular : semilunar fold of the lining membrane of the sac. The superior duct at first ascends, and then turns suddenly inwards towards the sac, forming an abrupt angle. The inferior duct forms the same kind of angle, by descending at first, and then turning abruptly inwards. They are dense and elastic in structure, and remain constantly open, s so that they act like capillary tubes in absorbing the tears from the f surface of the eye. The two fasciculi of the tensor tarsi muscle are i: inserted into these ducts, and serve to draw them inwards. The Lachrymal sac is the upper extremity of the nasal duct, and is >. scarcely more dilated than the rest of the canal. It is lodged in the .groove of the lachrj'mal bone, and is often distinguished, internally, t from the nasal duct, by a semilunar or circular valve. The sac consists of mucous membrane, but is covered in and retained in its place by a fibrous expansion, derived from the tendon of the orbicularis, - which is inserted into the ridge on the lachrymal bone; it is also covered by the tensor tarsi muscle, which arises from the same ridge, and in its action upon the lachrymal canals may serve to compress the -achrjmal sac. The Nasal duct is a short canal about three quarters of an inch in eength, directed downwards, backwards, and a little outwards to the .nferior meatus of the nose, where it terminates by an expanded orifice, tit is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous with the con- uunctiva above, and with the pituitary membrane of the nose below. I Ibstruction, from inflammation and suppuration of this duct, constitutes :he disease called fistula lachrymalis. Vessels and nerves.—The lachrymal gland is supplied with blood by lie lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery, and with nerves by the ichrymal branch of the ophthalmic and orbital branch of the superior axillary.512 THE ORGAN OF HEARING. The apparatus of hearing is composed of three parts; the external ear, middle ear or tympanum, and internal ear or labyrinth. The External ear consists of two portions, the jnnna and meatus; the former representing a kind of funnel which collects the vibrations of the atmosphere, producing sounds, and the latter a tube which con- veys the vibrations to the tympanum. The Pinna presents a number of folds and hollows upon its surface, ■which have different names assigned to them. Thus, the external folded margin is called the lieliso (£X/|, a fold). The elevation parallel to and in front of the helix is called antilielix opposite). The pointed process, projecting like a valve over the opening of the ear from the face, is called the tragus (r^dyos, a goat), probably from being sometimes covered with bristly hair like that of a goat; and, a tubercle opposite to this, is the antitragus. The lower dependent and fleshy portion of the pinna, is the lobulus. The space between the helix and antihelix is named the fossa innominata. Another depres- sion is observed at the upper extremity of the antihelix, which bifur- cates and leaves a triangular space between its branches, called the scaphoid fossa; and the large central space, to which aU the channels converge, is the concha, which opens directly into the meatus. The pinna is composed of integument, fJbro-cartilage, ligaments, and muscles. The Integument is thin, contains an abundance of sebiparous glands, and is closely connected with the fibro-cartilage. The Fibro-cartilage gives form to the pinna, and is folded so as to produce the various convexities and grooves which have been described upon its surface. The commences in the concha, and partially di- vides that cavity into two parts; on its anterior border is a tubercle for the attachment of the attrahens aurem muscle, and a little above this a small vertical fissure, the of the hdix. The termination of the helix and antihelix forms a lengthened process, processus caudatus, which is separated from the concha by an extensive fissure. Upon . the anterior surface of the tragus is another fissure, the of the tragus, and, in the lobulus, the fibro-cartilage is whoUy deficient. The fibro-cartilage of the meatus, at the upper and anterior part of the cylindei’, is divided from the concha by a fissure which is closed in the entire ear by ligamentous fibres; it is firmly attached at its termina- tion to the processus auditorius. The Ligaments of the external ear are those which attach the pinna to the side of the head, viz. the anterior, posterior, and ligament of the tragus; and, those of the fibro-cartilage, which serve to preserve its folds and connect the opposite margins of the fissures. The latter are two in number, the ligament between the concha and the processus caudatus, and the broad ligament which extends from the upper mar-513 MEATUS AUDITORIUS. gill of the fibro-cartilage of the tragus to the helix, and completes the meatus. The proper Muscles of the pinna are the— Major helicis, Minor helicis, Tragicus, Antitragicus, Transversus auriculae. The Major helicis is a narrow band of muscular fibres situated upon the anterior border of the helix, just above the tragus. The Minor helicis is placed upon the posterior border of the helix, at its commencement in the fossa of the concha. The Tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situated upon the tragus. The Antitragicus arises from the antitragus, and is inserted into the posterior extremity, or processus caudatus of the helix. The Transversus auriculae^ partly tendinous and partly muscular, extends transversely from the convexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the pinna. These muscles are rudimentary in the human ear, and deserve only the title of muscles in the ears of animals. Two other muscles are described by Mr. Tod,* the obliquus auris and contractor meatus, or trago-helicus. The Meatus auditorius is a canal, partly cartilaginous and partly osseous, about an inch in length, which extends inwards and a little forwards from the concha to the tjnnpanum. It is narrower in the middle than at each extremity, forms an oval cylinder, the long dia- meter being vertical, and is slightly curved upon itself, the concavity looking do%vnwards. It is lined by an extremely thin pouch of epithelium, which, when • withdrawn after maceration, preserves the form of the meatus. Some > stiff short hairs are also found in its interior, which stretch across the ; tube, and prevent the ingress of insects and dust. In the substance ■ of its lining membrane are a number of ceruminous glands, which secrete •■■the wax of the ear. Vessels and Nerves.—The pinna is plentifully supplied with artene^; !' by the anterior auricular from the temporal, and by the posterior auri- ;ular from the external carotid. Its Nerves are derived from the anterior auricular of the fifth, the ■ josterior auricular of the facial, and the auricularis magnus of the cer- ■ ical plexus. * “ The Anatomy and Physiology of the Organ of Hearing,” by David Tod, • 832. n L514 TYMPANUM.

It is concave towards the meatus, and convex towards the tympanum, and is composed of three layers, an eoiemal, epidermal; middle, fibrous and muscular; and, internal, mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The tjunpanum contains three small bones, ossicula a%iditus, viz., the malleus, incus, and stapes. The Malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle {manvr brium), and two processes, long (processus gracilis), and short (proeessus brevis). The manubrimn is connected with the membrana tympani by its whole length, extending below the central point of that membrane. It lies beneath the mucous layer of the membrane, and serves as a point of attachment to which the radiating fibres of the fibrous layer converge. The long process descends to a groove near the fissrira Glaseri, and gives attachment to the laxator tympani muscle. Into the short process is inserted the tendon of the tensor tympani, and the head of the bone articulates with the incus. The Incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resemblance to an anvil. It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer than, and widely separated from, the other. It consists of two processes, which unite nearly at right angles, and at their junction form a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus. The short process is attached to the margin of the opening of the mas- toid cells by means of a ligament; the long process descends nearly parallel with the handle of the malleus, and curves inwards, near its termination. At its extremity is a small globiilar projection, the os orbiculare, which in the foetus is a distinct bone, but becomes anchj’^- losed to the long process of the incus in the adult; this process articu- lates with the head of the stapes. The Stapes is shaped like a stirrup, to which it bears a close resem- blance. Its head articulates with the os orbiciilare, and the two branches are connected by their extremities with a flat, oval-shaped plate, representing the foot of the stirrup. The foot of the stirrup is received into the fenestra ovalis, to the margin of which it is con- nected by means of a circular ligament; it is in contact, by its sur- face, with the membrana vestibuli, and is covered in by the mucous linmg of the tympanum. The neck of the stapes gives attachment to the stapedius muscle. The ossicula auditus are retained in their position and moved upon themselves by means of ligaments and muscles. The Ligaments are three in number ; the ligament of the head of the malleus, which is attached to the upper wall of the tympa- num ; the ligament of the incus, a short and thick band, which serves to attach the extremity of the short process of that bone to the mar- gin of the opening of the mastoid cells; and the circular ligamentMUSCLES OF THE TYMPANUM. 516 which connects the margin of the foot of the stapes with the circum- ference of the fenestra ovalis. These ligaments have been described as muscles, by Mr. Tod, under the names of superior capitis mallei, obliquus incudis externus posterior, and musculus vel structura sta - pedii inferior. The Muscles of the tympanum are four in number, the— Tensor tyrapani, Laxator tympani, Laxator tympani minor. Stapedius. The Tensor tympani (musculus intemus mallei) arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid, from the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, and from the Eustachian tube, and passes forwards in a distinct canal, separated from the tube by the processus cochleari- formis, to be inserted into the handle of the malleus, immediately be- low the commencement of the processus gracilis. The Laacator tympani (musculus externus mallei) arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and passes through an opening in the fissura Glaseri, to be inserted into the long process of the malleus. This is regarded as a ligament by some anatomists. The Laxator tympani minor arises from the upper margin of the meatus, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus, near the pro- cessus brevis. This is regarded as a ligament by some anatomists. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and escapes from its summit to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. Foramina.—The openings in the tympanum are ten in number,^ue large andyiue small; they are— Large Openings. Meatus auditorius. Fenestra ovalis. Fenestra rotunda. Mastoid cells, Eustachian tube. Small Openings. i Entrance of the chorda tympani, j Exit of the chorda tympani, i For the laxator tympani. For the tensor tympani. For the stapedius. The opening of the meatus auditorius has been already described. The Fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli),. is a reniform opening, situated at the bottom of a small oval fossa (the pelvis ovalis), in the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum, directly opposite the meatus. The long diameter of the fenestra is directed horizontally, and its convex borders upwards. It is the opening of communication between the tympanum and vestibule, and is closed by the foot of the stapes and by the lining membranes of both cavities. The Fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae) is somewhat triangular in its form, and situated in the inner wall of the tympanum, below and517 FORAMINA OF THE TYMPANUM. rather posteriorly to the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated by a bony elevation, called i\\&promontory. It serves to establish a com- munication between the tympanum and the cochlea. In the fresh subject it is closed by a proper membrane (m. tympani secundaria,) as well as by the lining of both cavities. The Mastoid cells are numerous, and occupy the whole of the interior of the mastoid process and part of the petrous bone. They communicate by a large irregular opening with the upper and posterior circumference of the tympanum. The Eustachian tube is a canal of communication extending oblique- ly between the pharynx and the anterior circumference of the tympa- num. In structure it is partly fibro-cartilaginous and partly osseous, is broad and expanded at its pharyngeal extremity, and narrow and compressed at the tjunpanum. The smaller openings serve for the transmission of the chorda tym- pani nerve, and three of the muscles of the tympanum. The opening by which the chorda tympani enters the tympanum, is at about the middle of its posterior ivall, and near the root of the pyramid. The opening of exit for the chorda tympani is at the fissura Glaseri in the anterior xvall of the tympanum. The opening for the laxator tympani muscle is also situated in the fissura Glaseri, in the anterior wall of the tympanum. The opening for the tensor tympani muscle is in the inner wall, im- mediately above the opening of the Eustachian tube. The opening for the stapedius muscle is at the apex of a conical bony eminence, called the pyramid, Avhich is situated on the posterior wall of the t}Tnpanum, immediately behind the fenestra ovalis. Directly above the fenestra ovalis is a rounded ridge formed by the projection of the aquceductus Fallopii. Beneath the fenestra ovalis and separating it from the fenestra ro- tunda is the promontory, a rounded prominence formed by the projec- tion of the first turn of the cochlea. It is channelled upon its surface by three small grooves, which lodge the three tympanic branches of Jacobson’s nerve. The Foramina and processes of the tympanum may be arranged, according to their situation, into four groups. 1. In the External wall is the meatus auditorius, closed by the mertibrana tympani. 2. In the Inner wall, from above downwards, are the— Opening for the tensor tjunpani. Ridge of the aquaeductus Fallopii, Fenestra ovalis, Promontorj', Grooves for Jacobson’s nerve, Fenestra rotunda.518 INTERNAL EAR.—LABYRINTH. 3. In the Posterior wall are the— Opening of the mastoid cells, Pyramid, Opening for the stapedius, Opening for Jacobson’s nerve, Apertura chordae (entrance). 4. In the Anterior loall are the— Eustachian tube, Fissura Glaseri, Opening for the laxator tympani, Apertura chordae (exit). The tympanum is lined by a vascular mucous membrane, which in- vests the ossicula and chorda tympani, and forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani. From the tympanum it is reflected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout, and it passes through the Eustachian tube to become continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the tympanum are derived from the internal maxillary, internal carotid, and posterior auricular. Its Nerves are,—1. Minute branches from the facial, which are distributed to the stapedius muscle. 2. The chorda tympani, which leaves the facial nerve near the stylo-mastoid foramen, and arches 1 upwards to enter the tympanum at the root of the pyramid ; it then passes forwards between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to its proper opening in the fissura Glaseri. 3. The tym- panic branches of Jacobsori's nerve, which are distributed to the mem- branes of the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda, and to the Eusta- chian tube, and form a plexus by communicating with the carotid plexus, otic ganglion, and Vidian nerve. 4. A filament from the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. INTERNAL EAR. The Internal ear is called labyrinth, from the complexity of its com- munications ; it consists of a membranous and an osseous portion. The osseous labyrinth presents a series of cavities, which are channelled through the substance of the petrous bone, and is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the meatus auditorius intemus. It is ' divisible into the— i Vestibule, ^ Semicircular canals, i Cochlea. J •twavirVESTIBULE. 519 The Vestibule is a small three-cornered cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated immediately within the inner wall of the tympanum. The three comers, which are named ventricles or cornua, are placed, one anteriorly, one superiorly, and one posteriorly. The Anterior ventricle receives the oval aperture of the scala vesti- buli; the superior, the ampuUary openings of the superior and hori- zontal semicircular canals ; the posterior, the ampuUary opening of the oblique semicircular canal, the common aperture of the oblique and perpendicular canals, the termination of the horizontal canal, and the aperture of the aquaeductus vestibuli. In the anterior ventricle is a small depression, which corresponds with the posterior segment of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus; it is called the fovea he- mispherica, and is pierced by a cluster of small openings, the macula cribrosa. In the superior ventricle of the vestibule is another small depression, the fovea elliptica, which is separated from the fovea hemi- spherica by a projecting crest, the eminentia pyramidalis. The latter is pierced by numerous minute openings for the passage of nervous filaments. The posterior ventricle presents a third small depression, the fovea sulciformis, which leads upwards to the ostium aquieductus vestibuli. The internal wall of the vestibule corresponds with the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus, and is pierced by numerous small openings for the transmission of nervous filaments. In the external or tympanic wall is the reniform opening of the fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli), the margin of which presents a prominent rim towards the cavity of the vestibule. The openings of the vestibule may be arranged, like those of the tympanum, into large and small. The Large openings are seven in number : viz. the— Fenestra ovalis, Scala vestibuli. Five openings of the three semicircular canals. The Small openings are the— Aquaeductus vestibuli. Openings for small arteries. Openings for branches of the auditory nerve. The Fenestra ovalis has already been described ; it is the opening from the tympanum. The opening of the scala vestibuli is the oval termination of the ves- tibular canal of the cochlea. Ac/uceductus vestibuli (canal of Cotunnius) is the commencement of the small canal which opens under the osseous scale upon the pos- terior surface of the petrous bone. It gives passage to a process of membrane (which is continuous internally with the lining membrane of the vestibule, and extemaUy with the dura mater), and to a small vein.SEMICIRCULAR CANALS.—COCHLEA. 520 Tlie Openings for arteries and nerves are situated in tlie internal wall of the vestibule, and correspond with the termination of the meatus auditorius internus. The Semicircular canals are three bony passages communi- cating with the vestibule, into which they open by both extremities. Near one extremity of each of the canals is a remarkable dilatation of its cavity, which is called the ampulla (sinus ampullaceus). The superior, or perpendicular canal (danalis semicircularis verticalis supe- rior), is directed transversely across the petrous bone, forming a pro- jection on the anterior face of the latter. It commences, by means of an ampulla, in the superior ventricle of the vestibule, and terminates posteriorly by joining with the oblique, and forming a common canal, which opens into the upper part of the posterior ventricle. The middle or oblique canal (canalis semicircularis verticalis posterior) cor- responds with the posterior part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it commences by an ampullary dilatation in the posterior ven- tricle, and curves nearly perpendicularly upwards to terminate in the common canal. In the ampulla of this canal are numerous minute openings for nervous filaments. The inferior or horizontal canal (canalis semicircularis horizontalis) is directed outwards towards the base of the petrous bone, and is shorter than the two preceding. It commences by an ampullary dilatation in the superior ventricle, and terminates in the posterior ventricle. The Cochlea {snail-shell) forms the anterior portion of the laby- rinth, corresponding by its apex with the anterior wall of the petrous bone, and by its base with the anterior depression at the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus. It consists of an osseous and gradually tapering canal, about one inch and a half in length, which makes two turns and a half spirally around a central axis, called the modiolus. The central axis, or modiolus, is large near its base, where it corre- sponds with the .first turn of the cochlea, and diminishes in diameter towards its extremity. At its base, it is pierced by numerous minute openings, which transmit the filaments of the coch.ear nerve. These openings are disposed in a spiral manner: hence they have received, from Cotunnius,* the name of tractus spiralis foraminn- lentus. The modiolus is everywhere traversed, in the direction of its length, by minute canals, which proceed from the tractus spiralis foraininulentus, and terminate upon the sides of the modiolus, by opening into the canal of the cochlea or upon the surface of its lamina spiralis. The central canal of the tractus spiralis foraminulentus is larger than the rest, and is named the tubiilus centralis modioli ; it is continued onwards to the extremity of the modiolus, and transmits a nerve and small artery (arteria centralis modioli). • Bominico Cotunnius, an Italian physician ; his dissertation “ De Aquse- ductibus Auris Humane Internas” was published at Naples in 17C1.COCHLEA.—MODIOLUS. 521 The interior of the canal of the cochlea is pai-tially divided into two passages (scalae) by means of a thin and porous lamina of bone (zonula ossea lamina; spiralis), which is wound spirally around the modiolus in the direction of the canal. This bony septum extends for about two-thirds across the diameter of the canal, and in the fresh subject, is prolonged to the opposite wall by means of a membranous layer, so as to constitute a complete partition, the lamina spiralis. The osseous lamina spiralis consists of two thin lamellie of bone, between which, and through the perforations on their surfaces, the filaments of the cochlear nerve reach the membrane of the cochlea. At the apex of the cochlea the lamina spiralis terminates by a pointed, hook - shaped process, the hamulus laminae spiralis. The two scalae of the coch- lea, which are complete- ly separated throughout their length in the living ear, communicate supe- riorly, over the hamu- lus laminae spiralis, by means of an opening common to both, which has been termed by Breschet lielico-trema (sX<|, iXiaffca volvere—Inferiorly, one of the two scalae, the scala vestibuli, terminates by means of an oval aperture in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule ; while the other, the scala tympani, becomes somewhat expanded, and opens into the tympanum through the fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae). Near the termination of the scala tympani is the small opening of the aquae- ductus cochleae. The internal surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by a fibro- serous membrane, which is analogous to the dura mater in performing * The cochlea divided parallel with its axis, through the centre of the modi- olus.

These processes are the remains of a communication originally sub- sisting between the dura mater and the cavity of the labyrinth.* The Membranous labyrinth is smaller in size, but a perfect counterpart with respect to form, of the vestibule and semicircular canals. It consists of a small elongated sac, sacculus communis (utri- culus communis) ; of three semicircular membranous canals, which correspond with the osseous canals, and communicate with the sacculus communis '; and of a small round sac (sacculus proprius), which occupies the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and lies in close contact with the external surface of the sacculus communis. The membranous semi- circular canals are two-thirds smaller in diameter than the osseous canals. The membranous labyrinth is retained in its position by means of the numerous nervous filaments which are distributed to it from the openings in the inner wall of the vestibule, and is separated from the lining membrane of the labyrinth by the aqua labyrinthi. In stnictiure it is composed of four layers ; an external or serous layer, derived from the lining membrane of the labyrinth ; a vascular layer, in which an abundance of minute vessels are distributed; a nervous layer, formed by the expansion of the filaments of the vestibular nerve; and an internal and serous membrane, by which the limpid fluid which fills its interior is secreted. Some patches of pigment have been ob- served by Mr. Wharton Jones in the tissue of the membranous laby- rinth of man. Among animals such spots are constant. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a limpid fluid, first well described by Scarpa, and thence named liquor Scarpm i* (endolymph, vitreous humour of the ear), and contains two small calcareous masses, called otoconites. The otoconites {ovs, ^utos, x'ovt;, the ear- dust), consist of an assemblage of minute, crystalline particles of car- bonate and phosphate of lime, held together by animal substance, and scala vestibuli into the vestibule. 17.

The infundibulum. * Cotunnius regarded these processes as tubular canals, through which the anperabnndant aqua labyrinthi might be expelled into the cavity of the cra- nium. Mr. Wharton Jones, in the article “Organ of Hearing,” in the Cyclo- paedia of Anatomy and Physiology, also describes them as tubular canals which terminate beneath the dura mater of the petrous bone in a small dilated pouch. In the ear of a man, deaf and dumb from birth, he found the termination of the aqueduct of the vestibule of unusually large size in consequence of irregular development. t Antonio Scarpa is celebrated for several beautiful surgical and anatomi- cal monographs; as, for example, his work on “Aneurism,” “ De Auditu et Olfactu,” <fec. An account of the aqua labyrinthi will be found in his anato- mical observations “ De Structurd Fenestrse Rotund®, et de Tympano Secnndario.”524 DISTIUUUTION OF THE AUDITORY NERVE. probably retained in form by a reflection of the lining membrane of the membranous labyrinth. They are found suspended in the liquor Scarpae; one in the sacculus communis, the other in the sacculus pro- prius, from that part of each sac with which the nerves are connected. The Auditory nerve divides into two branches at the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius intemus ; a vestibular nerve and a cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve, the most posterior of the two, divides into three branches, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch gives off a number of filaments which pass through the minute openings of the eminentia pyramidalis and superior ventricle of the vestibule, and' are distributed to the sacculus communis and ampullm of the perpendicular and horizontal semicircular canals. The middle vestibular branch sends off numerous filaments, which pass through the openings of the macula cribrosa in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and are distributed to the sacculus proprius. The inferior and smallest branch takes its course backwards to the posterior wail of the vestibule, and gives off filaments which pierce the wall of the ampullary dilatation of the oblique canal to be distributed upon its ampulla. According to Stiefensand there is in the situation of the point of entrance of the nervous filaments into the ampulla a deep depression upon the exterior of the membrane, and upon the in- terior a corresponding projection, which forms a kind of transverse septum, partially dividing the cavity of the ampulla into two cham- bers. In the substance of the sacculi and ampullae, the nervous fila- ments radiate in all directions, anastomosing with each other and form- ing interlacements and loops, and they terminate upon the inner sur- face of the membrane in minute papillae, resembling those of the retina. Tlie Cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments which enter the foramina of the tractus spiralis foraminulentus in the base of the cochlea, and passing upwards in the canals of the modiolus, bend outwards at right angles, to be distributed in the tissue of the lamina spiralis. The central portion of the nerve passes through the tubulus centralis of the modiolus, and supplies the apicial portion of the lamina spiralis. In the lamina spiralis the nervous filaments lying side by side on an even plane form numerous anastomosing loops, and spread out into a nervous membrane. According to Treviranus and Gottsche, the ultimate terminations of the filaments assume the fonn of papillae. The Artenes of the labj'^ririth are derived principally from the audi- tory branch of the superior cerebellar artery. ORGAN OF TASTE. The Tongue is composed of muscular fibres, which are distributed in layers arranged in various directions ; thus, some are disposed longi- tudinally; others transversely; others, again, obliquely vendi vertically.TONGUE.—PAPILL/E. 5-25 Between the muscular fibres is a considerable quantity of adipose sub- stance. The tongue is connected, posteriorly, with the os hyoides by muscu- lar attachment; and to the epiglottis by mucous membrane, which forms the three folds called frcena epiylottidis. On either side it is held in connection with the lower jaw by mucous membrane, and in front a fold of that membrane, which is named frcenum lingua, is formed beneath its under surface. The surface of the tongue is covered by a dense layer analogous to the corium of the skin, which gives support to papillae. A rapM marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The Papillae of the tongue are the— Pig. 166.* Papillae circumvallatae, Papillae conicae. Papillae fiiiformes.

Each papilla resembles a cone, at- tached by its apex to the bottom, of a cup-shaped depression: hence they are also named papillae calyciformes. This cup-shaped cavity forms a kind of fossa around the papilla, whence their name circumvallatae. At the meeting of the two rows of these papillae upon the middle of the root of the tongue, is a deep mucous follicle called/oro/new caecum.. The Papillae conicae and jUiformes cover the whole surface of the tongue in front of the circumvallatae, but are most abundant towards * The tongue with its papillae. 1.

They are conical and filiform in shape, and many of them are pierced at the extremity by a minute aperture. Hence, the)' may be regarded as follicles rather than sentient organs; the true sentient papillae being extremely minute and occupying their surface, as they do that of the other papillae of the tongue. The Papilla: fungiformes (p. capitatae) are irregularly dispersed over the dorsum of the tongue, and are easily recognised among the other papillm by their rounded heads and larger size. A number of these papillae will generally be observed at the tip of the tongue. Behind the papillae circurnvallatae, at the root of the tongue, are a number of mucous glands, which open upon the surface. They have been improperly described as papillae by some authors. Vessels and Nerves.—The tongue is abundantly supplied with blood by the lingual arteries. The Nerves are three in number, and of large size : The gustatory branch of the fifth, which is distributed to the papillae, and is the nerve of common sensation and taste. The glosso-pharyngecd, which is dis- tributed to the mucous membrane, follicles, and glands of the tongue, is a nerve of sensation and motion; it also serves to associate the tongue with the pharynx and larynx. The hypoglossal is the motor nerve of the tongue, and is distributed to the muscles. To these may be added the chorda tympani, which conveys a motor influence from the facial nerve to the lingualis muscle. The Mucous membrane which invests the tongue, is continuous 1 with the derma along the margin of the lips. On either side of the i fraenum linguae it may be traced through the sublingual ducts into i the sublingual glands, and along Wharton’s* ducts into the sub- ! maxillary glands : from the sides of the cheeks it passes through the j openings of Stenon’s + ducts to the parotid glands : in the fauces, it forms the assemblage of follicles called tonsils, and may thence be traced downwards into the larynx and pharynx, where it is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth are a number of small gla:idular granules, which pour their secretion upon the surface. A considerable number of them are situated within the lips, in the ■ palate, and in the floor of the mouth. They are named from the position which they may chance to occupy, labial, palatal glands, &c. ORGAN OF TOUCH. The Skin is the exterior investment of the body, which it serves to cover and protect.

The DER.MA or cutis is chiefly composed of areolo-fibrous tissue, besides which it has entering into its structiu’e elastic and contractile flbrous tissue, together \vith blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. The areolo-fibrous tissue exists in greatest abundance in the deeper stratum of the derma, which is consequently dense, white, and coarse ; the superficial stratum, on the other hand, is fine in texture, reddish in colour, soft, raised into minute papillae, and highly vascular and sensitive. These differences in structure have given rise to a division of the derma into the deep stratum, or corium, and the super- ficial, or papillary layer. In the Corium the areolo-fibrous tissue is collected into fasciculi, which are small and closely interwoven in the superficial strata, large and coarse in the deep strata'; in the latter forming an areolar network with large areolas, which are occupied by adipose tissue. These areolae are the channels by which the branches of vessels and nerves find a safe passage to the papillary layer, in which and in the superfi- cial strata of the corium they are principally distributed. The yeUow elastic tissue is found chiefly in the superficial strata, the red con- tractile tissue in the deep. It is to the latter that the nipples and scrotum owe their contractile powers, and the general surface of the skin the contraction which is known by the name of cutis anserina. The corium presents some variety in thickness in different parts of the body. Thus in the more exposed regions, as the back, the outer sides of the limbs, the palms, and the soles, it is remarkable for its thickness ; while on protected parts it is comparatively thin. On the eyelids, the penis, and the scrotum it is peculiarly delicate. It is connected by its under surface with the common superficial fascia of the body. The Papillary layer of the derma is raised in the form of conical prominences or papiUae. On the general surface of the body the papillae are short and exceedingly minute ; but in other situations, as the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, and the plantar surface of the feet and toes, they are long and of large size. They also differ in arrangement; for, on the general surface they are distributed at equal distances and without order; whereas, on the palms and soles, and on the corresponding surfaces of the fingers and toes, they are collected into little square clumps containing from ten to twenty papillae ; and these little clumps are disposed in parallel rows. It is this arrangement in rows that gives rise to the characteristic pa- rallel ridges and furrows which are met with on the hands and feet. The papiUae in these little square clumps are for the most part uni- form in size and length, but every here and there one papilla maj^ be observed which is longer than the rest. The largest papillas of the derma are those which produce the nail; in the dermal follicle of the nail they are long and filiform, while beneath its concave surfaceSTRUCTURE OF THE El’lDERMA. .52« they form longitudinal and parallel plications which extend for nearly the entire length of that organ. In structure each papilla is composed of a more or less convoluted capil- lary and a more or less convoluted nervous loop. The EpinERMA or cuticle (scarf- skin) is a product of the derma, which it serves to envelope and de- fend. That surface of the epider- ma which is exposed to the influ- ence of the atmosphere and exterior sources of injury is hard and homy in texture, while that which lies in contact with the papillary layer is soft and cellular. Hence the epiderma, like the derma, is divi- sible into two layers, external and internal, the latter being termed the rete mucosum. Moreover, the epiderma is laminated in stracture, and the laminae present a progres- sively increasing tenuity and density as they advance from the inner to the outer surface. This diiference of density is dependent on the mode of growth of the epiderma, for as the external surface is con- stantly subjected to destruction from attrition and chemical action, so the membrane is continually reproduced on its internal surface ; new layers being successively formed on the derma to take the place of the old. The theory of growth of the epiderma, deduced from the observa- tions of Schwann, is as follows ;—A stratum of plastic lymph (liquor sanguinis) is poured out upon the surface of the derma. This fluid, by virtue of the vital force inherent in itself, and communicated to it by contact with a living tissue, is converted into gramdes, which are * Anatomy of a portion of skin taken from the palm of the hand, 1. The papillary layer, in which the longitudinal furrows (2) marking the arrange- ment of the papiUas into ridges is shown. Each ridge is moreover divided by transverse furrows (3) into small quadrangular clumps. The quadrangular clumps consist of a tuft of minute conical papills, of which one or two are frequently longer and larger than the rest. In this figure the long papillae are alone seen, the rest being too numerous to introduce into a wood-engraving. 4. The rete mucosum raised from the papiUaiy layer and turned back; the under surface of this stratum presents an accurate impression of the papillary layer; on which are seen longitudinal ridges corresponding with the longi- tudinal furrows, transverse ridges corresponding with the transverse furrows and quadrangular depressions corresponding with the quadrangular clumps of papiUsB.

By endosmosis, these cyto-blasts imbibe serum from the plastic lymph and adjacent tissues, and the outermost layer or pellicle of the cyto-blast becomes gradually distend- ed by the imbibed duid. The cyto-blast has now become a cell, and the solid portion of the cyto-blast, which always remains adherent to some one point of the internal surfoce of the cell-membrane, is the nticleus of the cell. Moreover, within the nucleus one or several nuclei are formed which are tenned nucleoli. By a continuance of the process of imbibition, the cell be- comes more or less spherical ; so that, after a time, every part of the surface of the papillary layer of the derma is coated by a thin and mem- branous stratum, consisting of sphe- rical cells lying closely pressed to- gether, and corresponding with every irregularity which the papillae present. But, as this production of cells is a function constantly in operation, a new layer is formed before the first is completed, and the latter is separated by subsequent formations farther and farther from the surface of the papillary layer. As a consequence of loss of contact with the derma, the vital force is progressively diminished ; the cell becomes subject to the influence of physical laws, and evaporation of its fluid slowly ensues. In con- sequence of this evaporation the cell becomes collapsed and flattened, and assumes an elliptical form ; the latter is by degrees converted into the flat ceU with parallel and contiguous layers, and an included nu- cleolated nucleus ; and lastly, the flattened cell desiccates into a thin membranous scale, in which the nucleus is no longer apparent. My own investigationsf- have shown that, after the original gra- nules of the liquor sanguinis have become aggregated into a granular nucleus, other granules are formed in successive circles, around the circumference of the nucleus, until the entire breadth of the epidermal ■ scale is attained ; that the cell never acquires a greater thickness than that of the original nucleus, and, that the formation of the scale results ■ from the desiccation of the cell, as it is gradually pushed outwards : from the derma towards the surface.

M MSTRUCTURE OF THE EPIDERMA. 530 arc perfected in the deepest layer of the epiderma ; and, in its in- ternal structure, it is a parent cell containing secondary and tertiar}' cells and granules, its growth being the result of the growth of these secondary formations. The under surface of the epiderma is accurately modelled on the papillary layer of the derma, each papilla having its appropriate sheath in the newly-formed epiderma or rete mucosum, and each irregularity of surface of the former having its representative in the soft tissue of the latter. On the external surface, this character is lost; the minute elevations corresponding with the papillaj, are, as it were, polished down, and the surface is rendered smooth and uniform. The palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet are, however, an exception to this rule ; for here, in consequence of the large size of the papillae and their peculiar arrangement in rows, ridges corresponding with the papillae are strongly marked on the superficial surface of the epiderma. The epiderma is remarkable for its thickness in situations where the papillae are large, as in the palms and soles. In other situations, it assumes a character which is also due to the nature of the surfece of the derma; namely, that of being marked by a network of linear fur- rows, which trace out the surface into small polygonal and lozenge- shaped areae. These lines correspond with the folds of the derma pro- duced by its movements, and are most numerous where those move- ments are the greatest, as in the flexures and on the convexities of joints. The dark colour of the skin among the natives of the South is due to the coloration of the primitive granules of which the cell is com- posed, especially the nucleus. As the cells desiccate, the colour of the granules is gradually lost; hence the deeper hue of the rete mucosum. The joomof the epiderma are the openings of the perspiratorj’ ducts, hair follicles, and sebiparous glands. ■, Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the derma which enter its i structure through the areolae of the under surface of the corium, divide i into innumerable intermediate vessels, which form a rich capillary j plexus in the superficial strata of the skin and in its papillary layer, j In the papillae of some parts of the derma, as in the longitudinal pli- > cations beneath the nail, the capillary vessels form simple loops, but in other papillae they are convoluted to a greater or less degree in pro- portion to the size and importance of the papillae. The Lyinphaiic vessels probably form, in the superficial strata of the derma, a plexus, the meshes of which are interwoven with those of the capillary and nervous plexus. No lymphatics have as yet been discovered in the papillae. The Nerves of the derma, after entering the areolae of the deeper part of the corium, divide into minute fiisciculi, which form a terminal plexus in the upper strata of the corium. From this plexus the primi- tive fibres pass off to their distribution, as loops, in the papilla. In the less sensitive parts of the skin the loops are simple and more or less acute in their bend, in conformity with the figiue of the papilla.APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. 531 In the sensitive parts, however, and especially in the tactile papillae of the pulps of the fingers, the loop is convoluted to a greater or less ex- tent, and acts as a multiplier of sensation. appendages of the SKIN. The appendages of the skin are the nails, hairs, sebiparous glands, and perspiratory glands and ducts. The Nails are horny appendages of the skin, identical in formation with the epiderma, of which they are a part. A nail is convex on its external surface, concave within, and implanted by means of a thin margin or root in a fold of the derma (matrix), which is nearly two lines in depth, and acts the part of a follicle to the nail. At the bottom of the groove of the follicle are a number of filiform papillm, which produce the margin of the root, and, by the successive formation of new cells, push the nail onwards in its growth. The concave sur- face of the nail is in contact with the derma, and the latter is covered by papilla, which perform the double office of retaining the nail in its place, and giving it increased thickness by the addition of newly- formed cells to Its under surface. It is this constant change occurring in the under surface of the nail, co-operating with the continual repro- duction taking place along the margin of the root, which ensures the growth of the nail in the proper direction. The nail derives a peculi- arity of appearance from the disposition and form of the papilla on the ungual surface of the denna. Thus, beneath the root, and for a short distance onwards towards its middle, the derma is covered by papilla which are more minute, and consequently less vascular than the papilla somewhat farther on. This patch of papilla is bounded by a semilunar line, and that part of the nail covering it being lighter in co- lour than the rest, has been termed lumda. Beyond the lunula the papilla are raised into longitudinal plaits, which are exceedingly vas- cular, and give a deeper tint of redness to the nail. These plait-like papilla of the derma are well calculated by their form to offer an ex- tensive surface both for the adhesion and formation of the nail. The granules and cells are developed on every part of their surface, both in the grooves between the plaits and on their sides, and a horny lamina is formed between each pair of plaits. When the under surface of a nail is examined, these longitudinal laminae, corresponding with the longitudinal papillae of the ungual portion of the derma, are distinctly apparent, and if the nail be forcibly detached, the laminae may be seen in the act of parting from the grooves of the papillm. It is this struc- ture that gives rise to the ribbed appearance of the nail. The papillary surface of the derma which produces the nail is continuous around the circumference of the attached part of that organ with the derma of the - surrounding skin, and the homy structure of the nail is consequently ' continuous with that of the epiderma. Hairs are horny appendages of the skin produced by the involution and subsequent evolution of the epiderma ; the involution constituting532 STRUCTURE OF HAIRS. the follicle in which the hair is enclosed, and the evolution the shaft of the hair. Hairs vary much in size and length in different parts of the body ; in some they are so short as not to appear beyond the follicle ; in others they grow to a great length, as on the scalp ; while along tlie margins of the eyelids and in the whiskers and beard, they are re- markable for their thickness. Hairs are generally more or less flatten- ed in form, and when the extremity of a transverse section is examined, it is found to possess an elliptical or reniform outline. This examina- tion also demonstrates that the centre of the hair is porous and loose in texture, while its periphery is dense ; thus affording ground for its division into a cortical and a medullary portion. The free extremit}' of a hair is generally pointed, and sometimes split into two or three filaments. Its attached extremity is implanted deeply in the integu- ment extending through the derma into the sub-cutaneous areolar tissue, * The anatomy of the skin. 1. The epiderma. 2.

The central extremity of a hair is larger than its shaft, and is called the root or bulb. It is usually conical in its shape. The process of formation of a hair by its follicle is identical with that of the formation of the epiderma by the papillary layer of the derma. Plastic lymph is in the first instance exuded by the capillary plexus of the follicle, the lymph undergoes conversion, first into granules, then into cells, and the latter are elongated into fibres. The cells which are destined to form the surface of the hair go through a different process. They are converted into flat scales, which enclose the fibrous structure of the interior. These scales, as they are succes- sively produced, overlap those which precede and give rise to the prominent and waving lines which may be seen around the circumfer- ence of a hair. It is this overlapping line that is the cause of the roughness which we experience in drawing a hair, from its point to its bulb, between the fingers. The bulb is the newly formed portion of the hair: its expanded form is due to the greater bulk of the fresh cells compared with the fibres and scales into which they are subsequently converted in the shaft. The colour of the hair, like that of the epiderma, is due to the co- loration of the primitive granules of the cells. The Sebiparous glands are sacculated glandular organs embedded m the substance of the derma, and presenting every variety of com- plexity, fi-om the simplest pouch-like follicle to the sacculated and lo- bulated gland. In some situations, the excretory ducts of these glands open independently on the surface of the epiderma; while in others, and the most numerous, they terminate in the follicles of the hairs. The sebiparous glands associated with the hairs are racemiform and lobulat- ed in structure, consisting of sacculi which open by short pedunculated tubuli into a common excretory duct, and the latter, after a short course, terminates in the hair-follicle. In the scalp there are two of these glands to each hair-follicle. On the nose and face the glands are of large size, distinctly lobulated, and constantly associated with small hair-follicles. In the meatus auditorius the sebiparous (ceruminous) glands are also large and lobulated, but the largest are those of the eyelids, the Meibomian glands. The excretory ducts of sebiparous glands offer some diversity in different parts of the body; thus, in many situations they are short and straight, while in others, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where the epiderma is thick, they assume a spiral arrangement. The sebiferous ducts are lined by an inversion of the epiderma, which forms a thick and funnel-shaped cone at its commencement, but soon becomes uniform and soft. Sebiparous glands are met with in aU parts of the body, but are most abundant in the skin of the face, and in those situations which are natoally ex- posed to the influence of friction. The sebaceous substance when it collects in inordinate quantities within the excretory ducts becomes the habitat of a very remarkable parasitic animal, the steatozoon folliculorum.534 SUDORIPAROUS GLANDS. Ihe Sudoriparous glands are situated deeply in the corium and also in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, where they are surrounded by adipose cells. They are small, oblong bodies, composed of one or more convoluted tubuli, or of a congeries of globular sacs, which open into a common efferent duct. The latter ascends from the gland through the derma and epiderma, and terminates on the surface by a funnel-shaped and oblique aperture or pore. The efferent duct presents some variety in its course upwards; thus within the derma it is curved and ser- pentine, and if the epiderma be thin, it proceeds more or less directly to the excreting pore. Sometimes it is spirally curved within the derma, and having passed the latter, is regularly and beautifully spiral in its passage through the epiderma, the last turn forming an oblique and valvular opening on the surface. The spiral course of the duct is especially remarkable in the thick epiderma of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. On those parts of the skin where the papillae are irregularly distributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriparous glands open on the surface also irregularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the pores are situated at regular dis- tances along the ridges, at points corresponding -with the intervals of the small, square-shaped, clumps of papillae. Indeed the apertures of the pores, seen upon the surface of the epidermal ridges, give rise to the appearance of small transverse furrows, which intersect the ridges from point to point. The efferent duct and the component sacs and tubuli of the sudori- parous gland are lined by an inflection of tbe epiderma. This inflec- tion is thick and infundibiliform in the upper stratum of the derma, but soon becomes uniform and soft. The infundibiliform projection is drawn out from the duct when the epiderma is removed, and may be perceived on the under surface of the latter as a nipple-shaped cone. A good view of the sudoriferous ducts is obtained % gently separating the epiderma of a portion of decomposing skin; or they may be better seen by scalding a piece of skin, and then withdrawing the epiderma from the derma. In both cases it is the lining sheath of epiderma which is drawn out from the duct.535 CHAPTER X. OF THE VISCERA. That part of the science of anatomy which treats of the viscera is named splanchnology, from the Greek words o-orAayX'’®''? viscus, and Xoyo;. The viscera of the human body are situated in the three great internal cavities: cranio-spinal, thorax, and abdomen. The viscera of the cranio-spinal cavity, namely, the brain and spinal cord, with the principal organs of sense, have been already described, in conjunction with the nervous system. The viscera of the chest are : the central organ of circulation, the heart; the organs of respiration, the lungs; and the thymus gland. The abdominal viscera admit of a subdivision into those which properly belong to that cavity, viz., the alimentary canal, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and supra-renal capsules ; and those of the pelvis : the bladder and internal organs of generation. THORAX. The thorax is the conical cavity, situated at the upper part of the trunk of the body; it is narrow above and broad below, and is bounded by the sternum, six superior costal cartilages, ribs, and inter- costal muscles in front; laterally, by the ribs and intercostal muscles ; and, behind, by the same structures, and by the vertebral column, as low down as the upper border of the last rib and the first lumbar vertebra; superiorly, by the thoracic fascia and first rib ; and in- feriorly, by the diaphragm. This cavity is much deeper on the pos- terior than on the anterior wall, in consequence of the obliquity of the diaphragm, and contains the heart enclosed in its pericardium, with the great vessels; the lungs, with their serous coverings, the pleurae; the oesophagus; some important nerves; and, in the foetus, the thymus gland. THE HEART. The central organ of circulation, the heart, is situated between the two layers of pleura which constitute the mediastinum, and is enclosed in a proper membrane, the pericardium. Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane like the dura mater, and resembles that membrane in deriving its serous layer536 PEIlICARniUM.—HEART. from the reflected serous membrane of the viscus which it encloses. It consists, therefore, of two layers, an external fibrous and an internal serous. The fibrous layer is attached, above, to the great vessels at the root of the heart, where it is continuous with the thoracic fascia; and below, to the tendinous portion of the diaphragm. The serous membrane invests the heart with the commencement of its great vessels, and is then reflected upon the internal surface of the fibrous layer. The Heart is placed obliquely in the chest, the base being directed upwards and backwards towards the right shoulder; the apex for- wards |nd to the left, pointing to the space between the fifth and sixth ribs, at about two or three inches from the sternum. Its under side is Fig. 170.» flattened, and rests upon the tendinous portion of the diaphragm; its upper side is rounded and convex, and formed principally by the right ventricle, and partly by the left. Surmounting the ventricles are the * The anatomy of the heart. 1. The right auricle. 2. The entrance of the superior vena cava. 3. The entrance of the inferior cava. 4.

The pulmonary artery is the large anterior vessel at the root of the heart; it crosses obliquely the commencement of the aorta. The heart con- sists of two auricles and two ventricles, which are respectively named, from their position, right and left. The right is the venous side of the heart; it receives into its auricle the venous blood from every part of the body, by the superior and inferior cava and coronary vein. From the auricle the blood passes into tlie ventricle, and from the ventricle through the pulmonary artery, to the capillaries of the lungs. From these it is returned as arterial blood to the left auricle ; from the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle; and from the left ventricle is carried through the aorta, to be distributed to every part of the bodj', and again returned to the heart by the veins. This constitutes the course of the adult circulation. The heart is best studied in situ. If, however, it be removed from the body, it should be placed in the position indicated in the above de- scription of its situation. A transverse incision should then be made along the ventricular margin of the right auricle, from the appendix to its right border, and crossed by a perpendicular incision, carried from the side of the superior to the inferior cava. The blood must then be removed. Some fine specimens of white fibrin are frequently found with the coagula; occasionally they are yellow and gelatinous. This appearance deceived the older anatomists, who called these substances “ polypus of the heart;” they are also frequently found in the right ventricle, and sometimes in the left cavities. The Right Auricle is larger than the left, and is divided into a principal cavity or sinus, and an appendix auriculse. The interior of the sinus presents for examination five openings; two valves ; two re- licts of foetal structure; and two peculiarities in the proper structure of the auricle. They may be thus arranged:— The right pulmonary artery, passing beneath the arch and behind the ascending aorta. 15.

The Superior cava returns the blood from the upper half of the body, and opens into the upper and front part of the auricle. The Inferior cava returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens through the lower and posterior wall, close to the partition between the auricles (septum auricularum). The direction of these two vessels is such, that a stream forced through the superior cava would be directed towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. In like manner, a stream rushing upwards by the inferior cava would force its current against the septum auricularum ; this is the proper direction of the two currents during foetal life. The Coronary vein returns the venous blood from the substance of the heart; it opens into the auricle between the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricular opening, under cover of the coronary valve. The Foramina Tlwbesii* are minute pore-like openings, by which the venous blood exudes directly from the muscular structure of the heart into the auricle, without entering the venous current. These openings are also found in the left auricle, and in the right and left ventricles. The Auriculo-ventriaular opening is the large opening of communica- tion between the auricle and ventricle. The Eustachian^ valve is a part of the apparatus of foetal circulation, and serves to direct the placental blood from the inferior cava, through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. In the adult it is a mere ves- tige and imperfect, though sometimes it remains of large size. It is formed by a fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, containing some muscular fibres, is situated between the aperture of the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricidar opening, and is generally connected with the coronary valve. The Coronary valve is a semilunar fold of the lining membrane, * Adam Christian Thebesius. His discovery of the openings now known by his name is contained in his “Dissertatio Medica de Circulo Sanguinis in Corde,” 1708. t Bartholomew Eustachius, bom at San Severino, in Naples, was Professor of Medicine in Borne, where he died in 1570. He was one of the foundere of modern anatomy, and the first who illustrated his works with good engravings on copper.

The Annulus ovalis is situated on the septum auricularum, opposite the termination of the inferior cava. It is the rounded margin of the septum, which occupies the place of the foramen ovale of the foetus. The Fossa ovalis is an oval depression corresponding with the fora- men ovale in the foetus. This opening is closed at birth by a thin valvular layer, which is continuous with the left margin of the annulus and is frequently imperfect at its upper part.

There is no fossa ovalis in the left auricle. ■The ruhcrculum Loweri* is the portion of auricle intervening be- tween the openings of the superior and inferior cava. Being thicker than the walls of the veins, it forms a projection, which was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava into the auriculo- vcntricular opening. The Miisculi pectinati are small muscular columns situated in the appendix auriculm. They are numerous, and are arranged parallel with each other; hence their cognomen, '■'•pectinati^" like the teeth of a comb. The Right ventricle is triangular and prismoid in form. Its an- terior side is convex, and forms the larger proportion of the front of the heart. The posterior side, which is also inferior, is flat, and rests upon the diaphragm; the inner side corresponds with the partition be- tween the two ventricles, septum ventriculorum. The right ventricle is to be laid open by making an incision parallel with, and a little to the right of, the middle line, from the pulmonary artery in front, to the apex of the heart, and thence by the side of the middle line behind to the auriculo-ventricular opening. It contains, to be examined, two openings, the auriculo-ventricular and that of the pulmonary artery ; two apparatus of valves, the tricus- pid and semilunar; and a muscular and tendinous apparatus belonging to the tricuspid valves. They may be thus arranged;— Auriculo-ventricular opening, Opening of the pulmonary artery. Tricuspid valves. Semilunar valves. Chordae tendineae, Carneae columnae. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane of the heart. It is the opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle. The Opening of the pulmonary artery is situated close to the septum ventriculorum, on the left side of the right ventricle, and upon the an- terior aspect of the heart. The Tricuspid valves are three triangular folds of the lining mem- brane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are con- nected by their base around the auriculo-ventricular opening ; and b}' their sides and apices, which are thickened, they give attachment to a number of slender tendinous cords, called chordae tendineae. The chordce tendineae are the tendons of the thick muscular columns (co- * Richard Lower, M. D. “ Tractatus de Corde; item de Motu et Colore Sanguinis,” 1669. His dissections were made upon quadrupeds, and his ob- servations relate rather to animals than to man.541 COLUMN/E CARNE.E. lumuB cameie) which stand out from the walls of the ventricle, and serve as muscles to the valves. A number of these tendinous cords converge to a single muscular attachment. The tricuspid valves pre- vent the regurgitation of blood into the auricle during the contraction of the ventricle, and they are prevented from being themselves driven back by the chordae tendineae and their muscular attachments. This connection of the muscular columns of the heart to the valves has caused their division into active and passive. The active valves are the tricuspid and mitral; the passive, the semilimar and coronary. The valves consist, according to Mr. King,* of curtains, cords, and columns. The anterior valve or curtain is the largest, and is so placed as to prevent the filling of the pulmonary artery during the distension of the ventricle. The right valve or curtain is of smaller size, and is situated on the right side of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The third valve, or ‘'‘fired curtain," is connected by its cords to the septum ventriculorum. The cords (chordae tendineae) of the anterior curtain are attached, principally, to a long column (columna caniea), wliich is con- nected with the “ right or thin and yielding wall of the ventricle.” From the lower part of this column a transverse muscular band, the “ Img moderator band," is stretched to the septum ventriculorum, or “solid tcall" of the ventricle. The right curtain is connected, by means of its cords, partly with the long column, and partly with its own proper column, the second column, which is also attached to the “yielding wail" of the ventricle. A third and smaller column is gene- rally connected with the right curtain. The “ fixed curtain" is so named from its attachment to the “ solid wail ” of the ventricle, by means of cords only, without fleshy columns. From this arrangement of the valves it follows, that if the right ventricle be over distended, the thin or “yielding wall" will give way, and carry with it the columns of the anterior and right valves. The cords connected with these columns will draw down the edges ■ of the corresponding valves, and produce an opening between the curtains, through which the superabundant blood may escape into the auricle, and the ventricle be relieved from over-pressure. This 1 mechanism is therefore adapted to fulfil the “ function of a safety valve." The Columned camece (fleshj’" columns) is a name expressive of the ; appearance of the internal walls of the ventricles, which seem formed I of muscular columns interlacing in almost every direction. They i are divided, according to the manner of their connection, into three (sets. 1. The greater number are attached by the whole of one I side, and merely form convexities into the cavity of the ventricle. ; 2, Others are connected bj’' both extremities, being free in the middle. • 3. A few (columnse papillares) are attached by one extremity to ! the walls of the heart, and by the other give insertion to the chordae ! tendineae. • “Essay on the Safety Valve Function in the Right Ventricle of the Human 1 Heart.” by T. W. King. Guy’s Hospital Reports, vol. ii..542 I.EFT AURICI.E. The Semilunar ixdves, three in number, are situated around the commencement of the pulmonary artery, being formed by a folding of its lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are attached by their convex borders, and free by the concave which are directed upwards in the course of the vessel, so that, during the current of the blood along the artery, they are pressed against the sides of the cylinder; but if any attempt at regurgitation ensue they are immediately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tube. The margins of the valves are thicker than the rest of their extent, and each valve presents in the centre of this margin a small fibro-cartilaginous tubercle, called corpus Arantii* which locks in with the other two during the closure of the valves, and secures the triangular space that would otherwise be left by the approximation of three semilunar folds. Between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are three pouches, called the sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva). Similar sinuses are situated behind the valves at the commencement of the aorta, and are larger and more capacious than those of the pulmo- nary artery. The Pulmonary ai'tery commences by a scalloped border, corre- sponding with the three valves which are attached along its edge. It is connected to the ventricle by muscular fibres, and by the lining mem- brane of the heart. The Left auricle is somewhat smaller, but thicker, than the right; of a cuboid form, and situated more posteriorly. The appendix auricvlcB is constricted at its junction with the auricle, and has a fo- liated appearance ; it is directed forwards towards the root of the pulmonary artery, to which the auriculae of both sides appear to con- verge. The left auricle is to be laid open by a shaped incision, the hori- zontal section being made along the border, which is attached to the base of the ventricle. It presents for examination five openings, and the muscular structure of the appendix; these are,— Four pulmonary veins, Auriculo-ventricular opening, Musculi pectinati. The Pulmonary vei7is, two from the right and two from the left lung, open into the corresponding sides of the auricle. The two left pulmo- nary veins terminate frequently by a common opening. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. The Musculi pectinati are fewer in number than in the right auricle, and are situated only in the appendix auriculae. • Julius Caesar Arantius, Professor of Medicine in Bologna. He was a dis- ciple of Vesalius, one of the founders of modem anatomy. His treatise “ De Humano Foetu ” was published at Rome, in 1564.543 LEFT VENTRICLE. Left Ventricle.—The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculonim, and continu- ing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. Fig. 172 ♦ The left ventricle is conical, both in external figure and in the form of its internal cavity. It forms the apex of the heart, by projecting beyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the ad- vantage in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven lines in thickness, those of the right ventricle being about two lines and a half. It presents for examination, in its interior, two openings, two valves, and the tendinous cords and muscular columns ; they may be thus arranged;— * The anatomy of the heart; the organ is viewed on its left side. 1.

The Auriculo-ventricular opening is a dense fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane of the heart, but smaller in size than that of the right side. The Mitral valves are attached around the aurieulo-ventricular opening, as are the tricuspid in the right ventricle. They are thicker than the tricuspid, and consist of only two segments, of which the larger is placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the com- mencement of the aorta, and acts the part of a valve to that foramen during the filling of the ventricle. The difference in size of the two valves, both being triangular, and the space between them, has given rise to the idea of a “bishop's mitre" after which they were named. These valves, like the tricuspid, are furnished with an apparatus of tendinous cords, chordae tendineae, which are attached to two verj' large columnae carneae. The Columnae carneae admit of the same arrangement into three kinds, as on the right side. Those which are free by one extremitj’’, the columnae papillares, are two in number, and larger than those on the opposite side ; one being placed on the left wall of the ventricle, and the other at the junction of the septum ventriculorum with the posterior wall. The Semilunar valves are placed around the commencement of the aorta, like those of the pulmonary artery; they are similar in struc- ture, and are attached to the scalloped border by which the aorta is connected with the ventricle. The tubercle in the centre of each fold is larger than those in the pulmonary valves, and it was these that Arantius particularly described ; but the terra corpora Arantii" is now applied indiscriminately to both. The fossae between the semi- lunar valves and the cylinder of the arter}’’ are larger than those of the pulmonary artery ; they are called the “ mnus aortici" (sinuses of Valsalva ). STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. The arrangement of the fibres of the heart has been made the subject of careful investigation by Mr. Searle, to whose article, “ Fibres of the Heart,” in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, I am indebted for the following summary of their distribution:— For the sake of clearness of description the fibres of the ventricles have been divided into three layers, superficial, middle, and internal, all of which are disposed in a spiral direction around the cavities of the ventricles. The mode of formation of these three layers willFIBRES OF THE VENTRICLES. 545 be best understood by adopting the plan pursued by Mr. Searle in tracing the course of the fibres from the centre of the heart towards its periphery. The left surface of the septum ventriculorum is fonned by a broad and thick layer of fibres, which proceed backwards in a spiral direction around the posterior aspect of the left ventricle, and become augmented on the left side of that ventricle by other fibres derived from the basis of the two columnae papillares. The broad and thick band formed by the fibres from these two sources, curves around the apex and lower third of the left ventricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it divides into two bands, a short or apicial band, and a long or basial band. The Short or apicial band is increased in thickness at this point by receiving a layer of fibres (derived from the root of the aorta and camese column®) upon its internal surface, from the right surface of the septum ventriculorum; it is then continued onwards in a spiral direction Irom left to right, around the lower third of the anterior surface, and the middle third of the posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum. From the latter point the short band is prolonged around the posterior and outer border of the left ventricle to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle, and is inserted into the anterior border of the left auriculo-ventricular ring, and the anterior part of the root of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The Long or basial band, at the anterior border of the septum, passes directly backwards through the septum, (forming its middle layer,) to the posterior ventricular groove, where it becomes joined by fibres derived from the root of the pulmonary artery. It then winds spirally around the middle and upper third of the left ventricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it is connected by means of its internal surface with the superior fibres derived from the aorta, which form part of the right wall of the septum. From this point it is continued around the upper third of the anterior and posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum, where it is con- nected with the fibres constituting the right surface of the septum ventriculorum. At the latter point the fibres of this band begin to be twisted upon themselves, like the strands of a rope, the direction of the twist being from below upwards. This arrangement of fibres is called by Mr. Searle “ the rope it is continued spirally upwards, forming the brim of the left ventricle, to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle, where the twisting of the fibres ceases. The long band then curves inwards towards the septum, and spreads out upon the left surface of the septum into the broad and thick layer of fibres with which this description commenced. The most inferior of the fibres of the left surface of the septum ventriculorum, after winding spirally around the internal surface of the apex of the left ventricle, so as to close its extremity, form a small fasciculus, which is excluded from the interior of the ventricle, and N NSTRUCTURE OF THE HEART. 546 expands in a radiated manner over the surface of the heart, con- stituting its superficial layer of fibres. The direction of these fibres is, for the most part, oblique, passing from left to right on the anterior and from right to left on the posterior surface of the heart, becoming more longitudinal near its base, and terminating by being inserted into the fibrous rings of the auriculo-ventricular openings, and of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Over the right ventricle the superficial fibres are increased in number by the addition of accessory fibres from the right surface of the septum, which pierce the middle layer, and take the same direction with the superficial fibres from the apex of the left ventricle, and of other accessory fibres from the surfiice of both ventricles. From this description it will be perceived, that the superficial layer of fibres is very scanty, and is pretty equally distributed over the surface of both ventricles. The middle layer of both ventricles is formed by the two bands, short and long. But the internal layer of the two ventricles is very differently constituted: that of the left is formed by the spiral expansion of the fibres of the rope, and of the two columnae papillares ; that of the right remains to be described. The septum ventriculorum also consists of three layers, a left layer, the radiated expansion of the rope and cameae columnae ; a middle layer, , the long band; and a right layer, belonging to the proper wall of the right ventricle, and continuous both in front and behind with the long band, and in front also with the short band, and with the superficial layer of the right ventricle. , | The Internal layer of the right ventricle is formed by fasciculi of *j fibres which arise from the right segment of the root of the aorta, from the entire circumference of the root of the pulmonary artery, and from the bases of the columnae papillares. The fibres from the root of the ; aorta, associated with some from the camese columnae, constitute a | layer which passes obliquely forwards upon the right side of the I septum. The superior fibres coming directly from the aorta join the internal surface of the long band at the anterior border of the septum, while the lower two-thirds of the layer are continuous with the in- ternal surface of the short band, some of its fibres piercing that band to augment the number of superficial fibres. The fibres derived from the root of the pidmonary artery, conjoined with those from the base of one of the columnae papillares, curve forwards from their origin, and Avind obliquely downwards and backwards aroimd the internal surface of the wall of the ventricle to the posterior border of the septum, where they become continuous with the long band, directly that it has passed backwards through the septum. Fibres of the Auricles.—The fibres of the auricles are disposed in two layers, external and internal. The internal layer is formed of fascicuU which arise from the fibrous rings of the auriculo-ventricular openings and proceed upwards to enlace Avith each other, and con- stitAite the appendices auricularum. These fasciculi are parallel in their arrangement, and in the appendices form projections and giA-eFIBRES OF THE AURICLES. 547 rise to the appearance which is denominated miisculi pectinati. In their course they give off branches which connect adjoining fasciculi, and form a columnar interlacement between them. External Layer.—The fibres of the right auricle having completed the appendix, wind from left to right around the right border of this auricle, and along its anterior aspect, beneath the appendix, to the anterior surface of the septum. From the septum they are continued to the anterior surface of the left auricle, where they separate into three bands, superior, anterior, and posterior. The superior band proceeds onwards to the appendix, and encircles the apex of the auricle. The anterior band passes to the left, beneath the appendix, and winds as a broad layer completely around the base of the auricle, and through the septum to the root of the aorta, to which it is partlj^ attached, and from this point is continued onwards to the appendix, where its fibres terminate by interlacing with the musculi pectinati. The posterior band crosses the left auricle obliquely to its posterior part, and winds from left to right around its base, encircling the open- ings of the pulmonarj’^ veins ; some of its fibres are lost on the sur- face of the auricle, others are continued onwards to the base of the aorta ; and a third set, forming a small band, are prolonged along the , anterior edge of the appendix to its apex, where they are continuous with the stiperior band. The septum auricularum has four sets of fibres entering into its formation ; 1. The fibres arising from the auri- culo-ventricular rings at each side ; 2. Fibres aidsing from the root of [ • the aorta, which pass upwards to the transverse band, and to the root of the superior cava ; 3. Those fibres of the anterior band that pass ; through the lower part of the septum in their course around the left . auricle ; and, 4. A slender fasciculus, which crosses through the sep- 11 turn from the posterior part of the right auriculo-ventricular ring to the I; left auricle. It will be remarked, from this description, that the left auricle is I (considerably thicker and more muscular than the right. V essels and Nerves.—The Arteries supplying the heart are the an- Itterior and posterior coronary. The Veins accompany the arteries, and leempty themselves by the common coronary vein into the right auricle. liThe lymphatics terminate in the glands about the root of the heart. Iirhe nerves of the heart are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which Irire formed by communicating filaments from the sympathetic and smeumogastric.t ( 54B ORGANS OF RESPIRATION AND VOICE. The organs of respiration are the two lungs, with their air-tube, the trachea, to the upper part of which is adapted an apparatus of carti- lages, constituting the organ of voice, or larynx. THE LARYNX. The Larynx is situated at the fore part of the neck, between the trachea and the base of the tongue. It is a short tube, having an hour-glass form, and is composed of cartilages, ligaments, muscles, vessels, nerves, and mucous membrane. The Cartilages are the— Thyroid, Cricoid, Two arytenoid. Two cuneiform. Epiglottis. The Thyroid (9-v^sos—sTSaj, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx : it consists of two lateral portions, or alee, which meet at an angle in front, and form the projection which is known by the name of poinum Adami. In the male, after puberty, the angle of union of the two alae is acute ; in the female, and before puberty in the male, it is obtuse. Where the pomum Adami is prominent, a bursa mucosa is often found between it and the skin. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and forms a rounded border posteriorly, which terminates above, in the superior cornu, and below, in the inferior cornu. Upon the side of the ala is an oblique line, or ridge, directed downwards and forwards, and bounded at each ex- tremity by a tubercle. Into this line the sterno-thyroid muscle is in- serted ; and from it the thj^ro-hyoid and inferior constrictor take their origin. In the receding angle, formed by the meeting of the two alae upon the inner side of the cartilage, and near its lower border, are attached the epiglottis, the chordae vocales, the thyro-arytenoid, and thyro-epiglottidean muscles. The Cricoid —iTlo;, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, narrow in front, and broad behind where it is surmounted by two rounded surfaces, which articulate with the arytenoid cartilages. At the middle line, posteriorly, is a vertical ridge which gives attachment to the oesophagus, and on each side of the ridge are the depressions which lodge the crico-arj'tenoidei postici muscles. On either side of the ring is a glenoid cavity, which articulates w’ith the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage.LIGAMENTS OF THE LARYNX. 549 The Arytenoid cartilages (a^uTa'iva* a pitcher), two in number, are triangular and prismoid in form. They are broad and thick below, where they articulate with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; pointed above, and prolonged by two small pyriform cartilages, comi- cula lui'pigis (capitula Santorini), which are curved inwards and back- wards, and they each present three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and internal. The posterior surface is concave, and lodges part of the ary- tenoideus muscle; the internal surface is smooth, and forms part of the lateral wall of the larynx; the anterior or external surface is rough and irregular, and gives attachment to the chorda vocalis, thyro-aryte- noideus, crico-arytenoideus lateralis and posticus, and, above these, to the base of the cuneiform cartilage. The Cuiieifoinn cartilages are two small cylinders of fibro-cartilage, about seven lines in length, and enlarged at each extremity. By the lower end, or base, the cartilage is attached to the middle of the ex- ternal surface of the arytenoid, and by its upper extremity forms a prominence in the border of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mem- brane. They are sometimes wanting. In the male, the cartilages of the larjmx are more or less ossified, particularly in old age. The Epiglottis (iviyXar'r't;, upon the tongue) is a fibro-cartilage of a yellowdsh colour, studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in shallow pits upon its surface. It is shaped like a cordate leaf, and is placed immediately in front of the opening of the larj-nx, which it closes completely when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue. It is attached by its point to the receding angle, between the two alee of the thyroid cartilage. Ligaments,—The Ligaments of the larynx are numerous, and may be arranged into four groups: 1. Those which articulate the thyroid with the os hyoides. 2. Those which connect it with the cricoid. 3. Ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages. 4. Ligaments of the epi- glottis. 1. The ligaments which connect the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number:— The two Thyro-liyoidean ligaments pass between the superior cornua of the thj’roid and the extremities of the greater cornua of the os hyoides : a sesamoid bone or cartilage is found in each. The Thyro-hyoidean membrane is a broad membranous layer, occupy- ing the entire space between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and the upper border of the os hyoides. It is pierced by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. 2. The ligaments connecting the thyroid to the cricoid cartilage are also three in number :— • This derivation has reference to the appearance of both caililages taken to- gether and covered by mucous membrane, in animals, which were the princi- pal subjects of dissection among the ancients, the opening of the larynx with the arytenoid cartilages bears a striking resemblance to the mouth of a pitcher having a large spout.550 LIGAMENTS OK THE LARVNX. Two Capsular lipamcnts, with their synovial membranes, which form the articulation between the inferior cornua of the thyroid and the sides of the cricoid; and the crico-thyroidean membrane. The erico- thyroidean nuimbra7ie is a fan-shaped layer of elastic tissue, thick in front (middle crico-thyroidean ligament) and thinner at each side (lateral crico-thyroidean ligament). It is attached by its apex to the lower border and receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and by its ex- panded margin to the upper border of the cricoid and base of the ary- tenoid cartilage. Superiorly it is continuous with the inferior margin of the chorda vocalis.

The space between the two chordae vocales is the glottis or rima glottidis. 4. The ligaments of the epiglottis are five in number, namely, three glosso-epiglottic, hyo-epiglottic, and thyro-epiglottic. The glosso-epiglottic ligaments (fraena epiglottidis) are three folds of mucous membrane, which connect the anterior surface of the epiglottis with the root of the tongue. The middle of these contains elastic tissue. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is a band of elastic tissue passing between the anterior aspect of the epiglottis near its apex, and the upper margin of the body of the os hyoides. The thyro-epiglottic liga- ment is a long and slender fasciculus of elastic tissue, which embraces the apex of the epiglottis, and is inserted into the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately below the anterior fissure and above the attachment of the chordae vo- cales. Muscles.—The Muscles of the larynx are eight in number: the five larger are the muscles of the chordae vocales and rima glottidis; the three smaller are muscles of the epiglottis. The five muscles of the chordae vocales and rima glottidis are, the— Crico-thyroid, Crico-arytenoideus posticus, Crico-arjrienoideus lateralis, Thyro-arytenoideus, Arytenoideus. The Crico-thyroid muscle arises from the anterior surface of the cri- coid cartilage, and passes obliquely outwards and backwards to be in- * A posterior view of the larynx. 1.

The Crico-arytenoideus posticus arises from the depression on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes upwards and out- wards to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid. The Crico-arytenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The Thyro-arytenoideus arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, close to the outer side of the chorda vocalis, and passes back- wards parallel Avith the cord, to be inserted into the base and outer surface of the arytenoid cartilage. ■ The Arytenoideus muscle occupies the posterior concave surface of the arytenoid cartilages, between Avhich it is stretched. It consists of three planes of transverse and oblique fibres; hence it Avas formerly considered as several muscles, under the names of transversi and ohliqui. The three muscles of the epiglottis are the— Thyro-epiglottideus, Aryteno-epiglottideus superior, Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior. The Thyro-epiglottideus appears to be formed by the upper fibres of the thyro- arytenoideus muscle : they spread out upon the external surface of the sacculus laryngis and in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, in Avhich they are lost; a feAV of the anterior fibres being continued onAvards to the side of the epiglottis. The A ryteno-epiglottideus superior consists of a few scattered fibres, which pass forAvards in the fold of mucous membrane forming the lateral boundary of the entrance into the larynx, fi’om the apex of the arj'tenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior.—This muscle, described by Mr. Hilton, and closely connected with the sacculus laryngis, ma}' be found by raising the mucous membrane immediately above the ventricle of the larATix. It arises by a narrow and fibrous origin from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the chorda vocalis; and passing * A side AdeAV of the larynx, one ala of the thyroid cartilage has been removed. 1.

Actions.—From a careful examination of the muscles of the larynx, Mr. Bishop* concludes, that the crico-arytenoidei postici open the glottis, while all the rest close it. The arytenoideus approximates the aryte- noid cartilages posteriorly, and the crico-arytenoidei laterales and thyro- arytenoidei anteriorly; the latter, moreover, close the glottis mesially. The crico-thyroidei are tensors of the chordae vocales, and these muscles, together with the thyro-arytenoidei, regulate the tension, position, and vibrating length of the vocal cords. The crico-thyroid muscles effect the tension of the chordae vocales by rotating the cricoid on the inferior cornua of the thyroid; by this action the anterior portion is drawn upwards and made to approximate the in- ferior border of the thyroid, while the posterior and superior border of the cricoid, together with the arytenoid cartilages, is carried backwards. The crico-arytenoidei postici separate the chordae vocales by drawing the arj-tenoid cartilages outwards and downwards. The crico-aryte- noidei laterales, by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages forwards, approximate the anterior angles to which the chordae vocales are attached. The thyro-arytenoidei draw the arytenoid cartilages forwards, and, by their connection with the chordae vocales, act upon the whole length of those cords. The thyro-epiglottideus acts principally by compressing the glands of the sacculus laryngis and the sac itself: by its attachment to the epi- glottis it would act feebly upon that valve. The aryteno-epiglottideus superior serves to keep the mucous membrane of the sides of the open- ing of the glottis tense, when the larynx is drawn upwards and the opening closed by the epiglottis. Of the aryteno-epiglottideus, the “ functions appear to be,” writes Mr. Hilton, “ to compress the sub- jacent glands which open into the pouch ; to diminish the capacity of that cavity, and change its form ; and to approximate the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilage.” Mucous Membrane.—The aperture of the larynx is a triangular or cordiform opening, broad in front and narrow behind; bounded ante- riorly by the epiglottis, posteriorly by the arytenoideus muscle, and on either side by a fold of mucous membrane stretched between the side of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilage. On the mar- gin of this aryteno-epiglottidean fold the cuneiform cartilage forms a prominence more or less distinct. The cavity of the larynx is divided into two parts by an oblong constriction produced by the prominence of the chordae vocales. That portion of the cavity which lies above the constriction is broad and triangular above, and narrow below; that which is below it, is narrow above and broad and cylindrical below, the circumference of the cylinder corresponding with the ring of the cricoid; * Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, art. Larynx.554 GLANDS OF THE LARYNX. while the space included by the constriction is a narrow, triangular fis- sure, the glottis or rima glottidis. The form of the glottis is that of an isosceles triangle, bounded on the sides by the chorda vocales and inner surface of the arytenoid cartilages, and behind by the aryte- noideus muscle. Its length is greater in the male than in the female, and in the former measures somewhat less than an inch. Immediate- ly above the prominence caused by the chorda vocalis, and extending nearly its entire length on each side of the cavity of the larynx, is an elliptical fossa, the ventricle of tlie larynx. This fossa is bounded below by the chorda vocalis, which it serves to isolate, and above by a border of mucous membrane folded upon the lower edge of the superior thyro- arytenoid ligament. The whole of the cavity of the larynx, with its prominences and depressions, is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous superiorly with that of the mouth and phar\mx, and infe- riorly is prolonged through the trachea and bronchial tubes into the lungs. In the ventricles of the larynx the mucous membrane forms a cffical pouch of variable size, termed by Air. Hilton the sacadus laryngis.* The sacculus laryngis is directed upwards, sometimes ex- tending as high as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and occa- sionally above that border. When dissected from the interior of the larynx it is found covered by the aryteno-epiglottideus muscle and a fibrous membrane, which latter is attached to the superior thyro-arj’te- noid ligament below ; to the epiglottis in front; and to the upper bor- der of the thyroid cartilage above. If examined from the exterior of the larynx, it will be seen to be covered bj^ the thyro-epiglottideus muscle. On the surface of its mucous membrane are the openings of sixty or seventy small follicular glands, which are situated in the sub- mucous tissue, and give to its external surface a rough and ill-dissected appearance. The secretion from these glands is intended for the lubri- cation of the chordae vocales, and is directed upon them by two small valvular folds of mucous membrane, which are situated at the entrance of the sacculus. * This sac was described by Mr. Hilton before he was aware that it had already been pointed out by the older anatomists. I myself made a dissection, which I still possess, of the same sac in an enlarged state, during the month of August, 1837, without any knowledge either of Mr. Hilton’s labours or Mor- gagni’s account. The sac projected considerably above the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and the extremity had been snipped off on one side in the removal of the muscles. The larynx was presented to me by Dr. George Moore of Camberwell; he had obtained it from a child who died of bronchial disease ; and he conceived that this peculiar disposition of the mucous membrane might possibly explain some of the symptoms by which the case was accompanied. Cruveilhier made the same observation in equal ignorance of Alorgagni’s de- scription, for we read in a note at page 677, vol. ii. of his Anatomic Lescriptin, —“ J’ai vu pour la premiere fois cette arrifere cavity chez un individu affecte de phthisie laryngee, oh elle etait tres-d6veloppee. Je fis des recherches sur le larynx d’autres individus, et je trouvai que cette disposition dtait constants. Je ne savais pas alors que Morgagni avait indiqud et fait representer la mgme dis- position.” Cruveilheir compares its form very aptly to a “ Phrygian castjac^' and Morgagni’s figure, Advers. 1. Epist. Anat. 3. plato 2. fig. 4, has the s.ame appearance. But neither of these anatomists notice the follicular glands de- scribed by Mr. Hilton.555 TRACHEA. Glands.—The bodies known as the glands of the larynx, namely, the epiglottic and the arytenoid, are very improperly named. The former is a mass of areolo-fibrous and adipose tissue, situated in the triangular space between the front surface of the apex of the epiglottis, the hyo-epiglottidean and the thyro-hyoidean ligament. The latter is the body which forms a prominence in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, and has been described among the cartilages as the cuneiform cartilage. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The nerves are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal; both branches of the pneumogastric. The two nerves communicate with each other freely ; but the superior larvngeal is distributed principally to the mucous membrane at the en- trance of the larynx; the recurrent, to the muscles. THE TRACHEA. The Trachea extends from opposite the fifth cervical vertebra to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi. The right brwichm, larger than the left, passes otf nearly at right angles to the upper part of the corresponding lung. The left descends ob- liquely^ and passes beneath the arch of the aorta, to reach the left lung. The Trachea is composed of — Fibro-cartilaginous rings. Fibrous membrane, Mucous membrane, Longitudinal elastic fibres. Muscular fibres, Glands. The Fibro-cartilaginous rings are from fifteen to twenty in number, and extend for two-thirds around the cylinder of the trachea. They are deficient at the posterior part, where the tube is completed by fibrous membrane. The last ring has usually a triangular form in front. The rings are connected to each other by a membrane of yellow elastic fibrous tissue, which in the space between the extremities of the cartilages, posteriorly, forms a distinct layer. The Longitudinal elastic fibres are situated immediately beneath the mucous membrane on the posterior part of the trachea, and enclose the entire cylinder of the bronchial tubes to their terminations. The Muscular fibres form a thin layer, extending transversely be- tween the extremities of the cartilages. On the posterior surface they are covered in by an areolo-fibrous lamella, in which are lodged the tracheal glands. These are small flattened ovoid bodies, situated in great number between the fibrous and muscular layers of the mem- branous portion of the trachea, and also between the two layers of elastic fibrous tissue connecting the rings. They pour their secretion upon the mucous membrane.556 THK LUNGS. Thyroid Gland. The thyroid gland or body is one of those organs wliich it is difficult to classify from the absence of any positive knowledge with regard to ' its function. It is situated upon the trachea, and in an anatomical * arrangement may therefore be considered in this place, although bear- ing no part in the function of respiration. This gland consists of two lobes, which are placed one on each side of the trachea, and are connected with each other by means of an isthmus., which crosses its upper rings. There is considerable variety in the situation and breadth of the isthmus, which should be recollected in the performance of operations upon the trachea. In structure it is composed, according to Mr. Simon,* of a dense aggregation of minute and independent membranous cavities enclosed by a plexus of capil- lary vessels, and connected together by areolo-fibrous tissue. The cavities are filled with fluid, in which are found cyto-blasts and cells; the latter measuring -5-5^0 inch in diameter. In young animals the cyto-blasts lie in contact with the internal wall of the cavities, and constitute a kind of tesselated epithelium. The gland is larger in young subjects and in females, than in the adult and males. It is the seat of an enlargement called bronchocele, goitre, or the Derbyshire neck. i A muscle is occasionally found connected with its upper border or i with its isthmus ; and attached, superiorly, to the body of the os hy- | oides, or to the thyroid cartilage. It was named by Soemmering the 1 levator glandulcB tliyroidecefig. 173, p. 50. Vessels and Nerves.—It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Sometimes an additional artery is derived from the arteria innominata, and ascends upon the front of the trachea to be distributed to the gland. The wounding of the latter vessel, in tracheotomy, might be fatal to the patient. The nerves are derived from the superior laryngeal and sympathetic. THE LUNGS, The lungs are two conical organs, situated one on each side of the chest, embracing the heart, and separated from each other by that oi'gan and by a membranous partition, the mediastinum. On the ex- ternal or thoracic side they are convex, and correspond with the form of the cavity of the chest; internally they are concave, to receive the convexity of the heart. Superiorly they terminate in a tapering cone, which extends above the level of the first rib, and inferiorly they are broad and concave, and rest upon the convex surface of the diaphragm. Their posterior border is rounded and broad, the anterior sharp, and marked by one or two deep fissures, and the inferior border which * The Comparative Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland. Philosophical Transac- tions, 1844.557 THE LUNGS. surrounds the base is also sharp. The colour of the lungs is pinkish- grey, mottled, and variously marked with black. The surface is figured with irregularly polyhedral outlines, which represent the lobules of the organ, and the area of each of these polyhedral spaces is crossed by lighter lines. Each lung is divided into two lobes, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the posterior surface of the upper part of the organ, downwards and forwards to neai’ the anterior angle of its base. In the right lung the upper lobe is subdivided by a second fissure. Fig. 176.* ♦ Anatomy of the heart and lungs, 1.

The right lung is larger than the left, in consequence of the inclina- tion of the heart to the left side. It is also shorter, from the great convexity of the liver, which presses the diaphragm upwards upon the right side of the chest considerably above the level of the left; and has three lobes. The left lung is smaller, has but two lobes, but is longer than the right. Each lung is retained in its place by its root^ which is formed b}’’ the pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins and bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary plexuses of nerves. The large vessels of the root of each lung are arranged in a similar order from before, backwards, on both sides, viz. Pulmonary veins. Pulmonary artery. Bronchus. From above, downwards, on the right side, this order is exactly re- versed ; but on the left side, the bronchus has to stoop beneath the arch of the aorta, which alters its position to the vessels. They are thus disposed on the two sides ;— Right. Bronchus, Arter}’', Veins. Left. Artery, Bronchus, Veins. Structure.—The lungs are composed of the ramifications of the bronchial tubes which terminate in intercellular passages and air-cells, of the ramifications of the pulmonary artery and veins, bronchial ar- teries and veins, lymphatics and nerves ; the whole of these structures, being held together by areolo-fibrous tissue, constitute the parenchyma. The parenchyma of the lungs, when examined on the surface or by means of a section, is seen to consist of small polyhedral divisions, or lobules, which are connected to each other by an inter-lobular areolar tissue. These lobules again consist of smaller lobules, and the latter are formed by a cluster of air-cells, in the parietes of which the capillaries of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are distri- buted. Bronchial Tubes.—The two bronchi proceed from the bifurcation of the trachea to their corresponding lungs. The right takes its course nearly at right angles with the trachea, and enters the upper part of the right lung; while the left, longer and smaller than the right, passes obliquely beneath the arch of the aorta, and enters the lung at about the middle of its root. Upon entering the lungs thej' divide into two branches, and each of these divides and subdivides dichoto- mously to their ultimate termination in the intercellular passages and air-cells.559 BRONCHIAL TUBES. According to !Mr. Rainey," the bronchial tubes continue to dimi- nish in size until they atbiin a diameter of to of an inch, and arrive within of an inch of the surface of the lung. They then be- come changed in structure, and are continued onwards in the midst of air-cells, under the name of intercellular passages. Lastly, the inter- cellular passages, after several bifurcations, terminate, each by a cmcal extremity or air-cell. The intercellular passages are at first cylindrical like the bronchial tubes, but soon become ii-regular in shape from the great number of air-cells which open into them on all sides. The air-cells are small, irregular in shape, and, most frequently, four-sided cavities, separated by thin septa, and communicating freely with the intercellular passages, and sparingly Avith the bronchial tubes. The air-cells composing a lobule also communicate freely with each other. The bronchial tubes, after the cessation of the fibro-cartilaginous plates, are composed of fibrous membrane (constructed of longitudinal and circular fibres) and mucous membrane, the latter being invested by a ciliated columnar epithelium. At the termination of these tubes the mucous membrane and epithelium cease abruptly, and the fibrous membrane, very thin and transparent, is continued onwards through the intercellular passages and air-cells. The same change takes place in the structure of the parietes, where the air-cells open directly into the bronchial tubes. The capillaries of the lungs form plexuses which occupy the walls and septa of the air-cells and the walls of the intercellular passages, but are not continued into the bronchial tubes. The septa between the cells consist of a single layer of the capillary plexus enclosed in a fold of the fibrous lining membrane. The cells of the central parts of the lung are most vascidar, and at the same time smallest, while those of the periphery are less vascular and larger. The pigmentary matter of the lungs is contained in the air-cells, as Avell as in the areolo-fibrous tissue of the inter-lobular spaces and of the blood-vessels. The Pulmonary artery, conveying the dark and impure venous blood to the lungs, terminates in capillary vessels, which form a minute net- • work in the parietes of the intercellular passages and air-cells, and then converge to form the pulmonary veins, by which the arterial blood, ! purified in its passage through the capillaries, is returned to the left .•auricle of the heart. The Bronchial arteries, branches of the thoracic aorta, ramify on the r parietes of the bronchial tubes, Avhile the venous blood is returned by ; the bronchial veins to the vena azygos. The Lymphatics, commencing on the surface and in the substance of the lungs, terminate in the bronchial glands. These glands, very : numerous and often of large size, are placed at the roots of the lungs, (around the bronchi, and at the bifurcation of the trachea. In early life • they resemble lymphatic glands in other situations; but in old age, and Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxviii.5G0 PLEUR/B.—MEDIASTINUM. often in the adult, are quite black, and filled with carbonaceous matter,' and occasionally with calccureous deposits. The Nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. They form two plexuses; anterior ■pulmonary plexus^ situated upon the front of the root of the lungs, and composed chiefly of filaments from the great cardiac plexus; and posterior pulmonary plexus, on the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs, composed principally of branches from the pneumogastric. The branches from these plexuses follow the course of the bronchial tubes, and are distributed to the in- tercellular passages and air-cells. PLEURAJ. Each lung is enclosed, and its structure maintained, by a serous membrane, the pleura, which invests it as far as the root, and is then reflected upon the parietes of the chest. That portion of the membrane which is in relation with the lung is called pleura pulmo- nalis, and that in contact with the parietes, pleura costalis. The reflected portion, besides forming the internal lining to the ribs and intercostal muscles, also covers the diaphragm and the thoracic surface of the vessels at the root of the neck. The pleura must be dissected from off the root of the lung, to see the vessels by which it is formed, and the pulmonary plexuses. MEDIASTINUM. The approximation of the two reflected pleurae in the middle line of the thorax forms a septum, which divides the chest into the two ^ pulmonary cavities. This is the mediastinum. The two pleurae are not, however, in contact with each other at the middle line in the formation of the mediastinum, but have a space between them which | contains all the viscera of the chest with the exception of the lungs; j The mediastinum is divided into the anterior, middle, and posterior. | The Anterior mediastinum is a triangular space, bounded in front by i the sternum, and on each side by the pleura. It contains a quantity | of loose areolar tissue, in which are found some lymphatic vessels I passing upwards from the liver, the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the stemo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and triangularis stemi muscles, and the internal mammary vessels of the left side. The Middle mediastinum contains the heart enclosed in its peri- cardium ; the ascending aorta ; the superior vena cava ; the bifurca- tion of the trachea; the pulmonary arteries and veins; and the phrenic nerves. The Posterior rnediastinum is bounded behind by the vertebral column, in front by the pericardium, and on each side by the pleura. It contains the descending aorta; the greater and lesser az}’gos veins, the superior intercostal vein; the thoracic duct; the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves, and the great splanchnic nerves.561 ABDOMEN. The abdomen is the inferior cavity of the trunk of the body; it is bounded in front and at the sides by the lower ribs and abdominal muscles ; behind, by the vertebral column and abdominal muscles ; Fig. 177.* * The viscera of the abdomen in situ. 1,1.

Regions.—For convenience of description of the viscera, and of re- ference to the morbid affections of this cavity, the abdomen is divided into certain districts or regions. Thus, if two transverse lines be carried around the body, the one parallel with the inferior convexities of the ribs, tlie other with the highest points of the crests of the ilia, the abdomen will be divided into three zones. Again, if a perpendi- cular line be drawn, at each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart’s ligament, the three primary zones will each be subdivided into three compartments or regions, a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone being immediately over the small end of the stomach, is called epigastric (etr/ yaffrri^, over the stomach). The two lateral regions, being under the cartilages of the ribs, are called hypochondriac (u-ra ^'ovh^oi., under the cartilages). The middle region of the middle zone is the umbilical; the two lateral, the lumbar. The middle region of the inferior zone is the hypogastric (bvo yaffTTi^, below the stomach); and the two lateral, the iliac. In addition to these divisions, we employ the term inguinal region, in reference to the vicinity of Poupart’s ligament. Position of the Viscera.—In the upper zone will be seen the liver, extending across from the right to the left side ; the stomach and spleen on the left, and the pancreas and duodenum behind. In the middle zone is the transverse portion of the colon, with the upper part of the ascending and descending colon, omentum, small intestines, mesentery, and, behind, the kidneys and supra-renal capsules. In- the inferior zone is the lower part of the omentum and small intes- tines, the caecum, ascending and descending colon with the sigmoid flexure, and ureters. The smooth and polished surface, which the viscera and parietesJ of the abdomen present, is due to the peritoneum, which should in the I next place be studied. PERITONEUM. ! The Peritoneum to extend around) is a serous membrane, , i: and therefore a shut sac : a single exception exists in the human ' [ subject to this character, viz. in the female, where the peritoneum is perforated by the open extremities of the Fallopian tubes, and is con- tinuous with their mucous lining. The simplest idea that can be given of a serous membrane, which j may apply equally to all, is, that it invests the viscus or viscera, and is then reflected upon the parietes of the containing cavity. If the cavity contain only a single viscus, the consideration of the serous563 PERITONEUM. membrane is extremely simple. But in the abdomen, where there are a number of viscera, the serous membrane passes from one to tlie other until it has invested the whole, before it is reflected on the parietes. Hence its reflexions are a little more complicated. In tracing the reflexions of the peritoneum in the middle line, Ave commence with the diaphragm, which is lined by two layers, one from the parietes in front, anterior, and one from the parietes behind, posterior. These two layers of the same membrane, at the posterior part of the diaphragm, descend to the upper surface of the liver, forming the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liver. They then surround the liver, one going in front, the other behind that viscus, and, meeting at its imder siuface, pass to the stomach, forming the lesser omentum. They then, in the same manner, surround the stomach, and, meeting at its lower border, descend for some distance in front of the intestines, and return to the transverse colon, forming the great omentum; they then siwround the transverse colon, and pass directly backwards to the vertebral column, forming the transverse meso-colon. Here the tAvo layers separate; the posterior ascends in front of the pancreas and aorta, and returns to the posterior part of the diaphragm, Avhere it becomes the posterior layer with which Ave commenced. The anterior descends, invests all the small intestines, and returning to the vertebral column, forms the mesentery. It then descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, Avhich it holds in its place by means of a fold called meso-rectum, forms a pouch, the recto- vesical fold, between the rectum and bladder, ascends upon the poste- rior surface of the bladder, forming its false ligaments, and returns upon the anterior parietes of the abdomen to the diaphragm, Avhence we first traced it. In the female, after descending into the pelvis in front of the rectum, it is reflected upon the posterior surface of the vagina and uterus. It then descends on the anterior surface of the utenis, and ■ forms at either side the broad ligaments of that organ. From the uterus it ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder and ante- ■ rior parietes of the abdomen, and is continued, as in the male, to the diaphragm. In this way the continuity of the peritoneum, as a whole, is dis- ; tinctly shewn, and it matters not where the examination commence or where it terminate, still the same continuity of surface Avill be discernible throughout. If Ave trace it from side to side of the ab- . domen, we may commence at the umbilicus ; we then folloAv it out- ’wards, lining the inner side of the parietes to the ascending colon ; ; it surrounds that intestine ; it then surrounds the small intestine, and, returning on itself, forms the mesentery. It then invests the descending colon, and reaches the parietes on the opposite side of the ; abdomen, whence it may be traced to the exact point from which we ' started.564 PERITONEUM,— DUPLICATURES.

If the finger be introduced behind this right border of the lesser omentum, it will be situated in an opening called the foranvm of Winslow.* In front of the finger will lie the right border of the lesser omentum ; behind it the diaphragm, covered by the ascending or posterior layer of the peritoneum ; below, the hepatic artery, curving forwards from the coeliac axis ; and oLove, the lobus Spigelii. These, therefore, are the boundaries of the foramen of Winslow, which is no- thing more than a constriction of the general cavity of the peritoneum at this point, arising out of the necessity for the hepatic and gastric arteries to pass forwards from the coeliac axis to reach their respective viscera. If air be blown through the foramen of Winslow, it will descend behind the lesser omentum and stomach to the space between the descending and ascending pair of layers, forming the great omentum. This is sometimes called the lesser cavity of the peritoneum, and that external to the foramen the greater cavity ; in which case the fora- men is considered as the means of communication between the two. There is a great objection to this division, as it might lead the inex- perienced to believe that there were really two cavities. There is but one only, the foramen of Winslow being merely a constriction of that one, to facilitate the communication between the nutrient arteries and the viscera of the upper part of the abdomen. The Great omentum consists oifour layers of peritoneum, the two which descend from the stomach, and the same two, returning upon themselves to the transverse colon. A quantity of adipose substance is deposited around the vessels which ramify through its structure. It would appear to perform a double function in the economy. 1st. Protecting the intestines from cold ; and, 2ndly. Facilitating the movement of the intestines upon each other during their vermicular action. The Transverse meso-colon {[ttiro;, middle, being attached to the middle of the cylinder of the intestine) is the medium of connection between the transverse colon and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It also affords to the nutrient arteries a passage to reach the intestine, and encloses between its layers, at the posterior part, the transverse portion of the duodenum. The Mesentery {ykrat evn^ov, being connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine) is the medium of connection between the small intestines and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is ob- lique in its direction, being attached to the posterior wall, from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa. It retains the small intestines in their places, and gives passage to the mesenteric arteries, veins, nerves, and Ijnnphatics. * Jacob Benignus Winslow: his “ Exposition Anatomique de la Structure du Corps Humain” was published in Paris in 1732.ALIMENTARY CANAL. 567 The Meso-recium, in like manner, retains the rectum in connection with the front of tlie sacrum. Besides this, there are some minor folds in the pelvis, as the recto-vesical fold, the false ligaments of the bladder, and the bivad ligaments of the uterus. The Appendices epiploiccB ai'e small irregular pouches of the perito- neum, filled with fat, and situated like fringes upon the large intestine. Three other duplicatures of the peritoneum are situated in the sides of the abdomen ; they are, the gastro-phrenic ligament, the gastro-splenic omentum, the ascending and descending meso-colon. The gastro- phrenic ligament is a small duplicature of the peritoneum, which de- scends from the diaphragm to the extremity of the oesophagus, and lesser curve of the stomach. The gastro-splenic omentum is the dupli- cature which connects the spleen to the stomach. The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects the upper part of the ascending colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; and the descending meso-colon, that which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the abdominal wall. Structure of Serous Membrane.—SeroUs membrane consists of two layers, an external or areolo-fibrous layer, and an internal layer or epithelium. The areolo-fibrous layer upon its outer surface is rough and vascular, and adherent to surrounding structures; but on its inner or free surface is dense and smooth, and deficient of vessels. The smooth and brilliant surface of serous membrane is due to a distinct epithelium, composed of laminae of cells, and flattened poly- hedral scales with central nuclei, like the epiderma and epithelium of mucous membrane. Henle has also observed this structure, which may be demonstrated with a good microscope, on the surface of all the serous membranes of the body, upon the surface of the lining mem- brane of arteries and veins, and on synovial membranes. The general characters of a serous membrane are its resemblance to a shut sac, and its secretion of a peculiar fluid, resembling the serum of the blood; but the former of these characters is not absolutely essential to the identity of a serous membrane; for, as we have shewn above, the peritoneum in the female is perforated by the extremities of the Fallopian tubes ; while in some aquatic reptiles there is a direct communication between its cavity and the medium in which they live. From the variable nature of the secretion of these membranes, they have been divided into two classes, the true serous membranes, viz. the arachnoid, pericardium, pleurae, peritoneum, and tunicae vaginales, which pour out a secretion containing but a small portion of albumen ; and the sjmovial membranes and bursae, which secrete a fluid contain- ing a larger quantity of albumen. ALIMENTARY CANAL. The Alimentary canal is a musculo-membranous tube, extending from the mouth to the anus. It is variously named in the different parts of its course; hence it is divided into, theAIOUTH. HAKD PALATE. Mouth, Ph.arynx, Gisoph.ugus, Stomach, r Duodenum, Small intestine ;• Jejunum, I, Ileum, r Caecum, Large intestines Colon, L Rectum. The Mouth is the irregular cavity which contains the organs of taste and the principal instruments of mastication. It is bounded, in front, by the lips; on either side, by the internal surface of the cheeks ; oLove, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongue, by the mucous membrane stretched between the arch of the lower jaw and the under surface of the tongue, and by the teeth of the inferior maxilla; and, behind, by the soft palate and fauces. The Lips are two fleshy folds formed externally by common integu- ment, and internally by mucous membrane, and containing between these two layers the muscles of the lips, a quantity of fat, and numer- ous small labial glands. They are attached to the surface of the upper and lower jaw, and each lip is connected to the gum in the middle line by a fold of mucous membrane, the frajnum labii superioris and fraenum labii inferioris, the former being the larger. The Cheehs (buccse) are continuous on either hand with the lips, and form the sides of the face; they are composed of integument, a large quantity of fat, muscles, mucous membrane, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheeks is reflected above and below upon the sides of the jaws, and is attached posteriorly to the anterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw. At about its middle, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, is a papilla, upon which may be observed a small opening, the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The Hard palate is a dense structure, composed of mucous membrane, palatal glands, fibrous tissue, vessels, and nerves, and firmly connected to the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones. It is bounded in front and on each side by the alveolar processes and gums, and is continuous behind with the soft palate. Along the middle line it is marked by an elevated raphe, and presents upon each side of the raphe a number of transverse ridges and grooves. Near its anterior extremity, and immediately behind the middle incisor teeth, is a papilla which corresponds with the termination of the naso- palatine canal, and has been supposed to be endowed with a peculiar sensibility. The Gums are composed of a thick and dense mucous membrane, which is closely adherent to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and embraces the necks of the teeth. They are remarkable for theirI SOFT PALATE. TONSILS.—SALIVARY GLANDS. 569 hardness and insensibility; and for their close contact, without ad- hesion, to the surface of the tooth. From the neck of the tooth they are reflected into the alveolus, and become continuous with the peri- osteal (peridental) membrane of that cavity. The Tongue has been already described as an organ of sense ; it is invested by mucous membrane, which is reflected from its under part I upon the inner surface of the lower jaw, and constitutes, with the I muscles beneath, the floor of the mouth. Upon the under surface of the tongue, near its anterior part, the mucous membrane forms a con- siderable fold, which is called the fraenum linguae; and on each side of the fraenum is a large papilla, the commencement of the duct of the ; • submaxillary gland, and several smaller openings, the apertures of the ! ducts of the sublingual gland. The Soft galate (velum pendulum palati) is a fold of mucous mem- ! brane situated at the posterior part of the mouth. It is continuous, I superiorly, with the hard palate, and is composed of mucous membrane, I paktal glands, and muscles. Hanging from the middle of its inferior I border is a small rounded process, the uvula ; and passing outwards from the uvula on each side are two curved folds of the mucous mem- brane, the arches or pillars of the palate. The anterior pillar is con- tinued downwards to the side of the base of the tongue, and is formed i by the prominence of the palato-glossus muscle. The posterior pillar is prolonged downwards and backwards into the pharynx, and is formed by the convexity of the palato-pharyngeus muscle. These two pillars, closely united above, are separated below by a triangular interval or niche, in which the tonsil is lodged. The Tonsils (amygdalae) are two glandular organs, shaped like almonds, and situated between the anterior and posterior pillar of the soft palate, on each side of the fauces. They are composed of an as- semblage of mucous follicles, which open upon the surface of the gland. Externally, they are invested by the pharyngeal fascia, which sepa- rates them from the superior constrictor muscle and internal carotid arten.', and prevents an abscess from opening in that direction. In re- , lation to surrounding parts, they correspond with the angle of the lower jaw. The space included between the soft palate and the root of the tongue is the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded above by the soft palate ; on each side by the pillars of the soft palate and tonsils; and below by the root of the tongue. It is the opening between the mouth i and pharj-nx. SALIVARY GLANDS. Communicating with the mouth are the excretory ducts of three pairs of salivary glands, the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. The Parotid gland, (traja, near, ol;, arof, the ear,) the largest of the three, is situated immediately in front of the external ear, and extends570 SUIIMAXII.LAIIV Or-AND.—SUUMNGUAI. GLAND. superficially for a short distance over the masseter muscle, and deeply behind the ramus of the lower jaw. It reaches inferiorly to below the level of the angle of the lower jaw, and posteriorly to the mastoid process, slightly overlapping the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Embedded in its substance are the external carotid artery, temporo- maxillary vein, and facial nerve; emerging from its anterior border, the transverse facial artery and branches of the pes anserinus; and above, the temporal artery. The duct of the parotid gland (Stenon’s* duct) commences at the papilla upon the internal surface of the cheek, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw; and, piercing the buccinator muscle, crosses the masseter to the anterior border of the gland, where it divides into several branches, which subdivide and ramify through its structure, to terminate in the small csecal pouches of which the gland is composed. A small branch is generally given oif from the duct while crossing the masseter muscle, which forms, by its ramifications and terminal dilatations, a small glandular appendage, the soda, parotidis. Stenon’s duct is remarkably dense and of considerable thickness, while the area of its canal is extremely small. The Submaxillary gland is situated in the posterior angle of the submaxillary triangle of the neck. It rests upon the hyo-glossus and mylo-hyoideus muscles, and is covered in by the body of the lower jaw and by the deep cervical fascia. It is separated from the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillary ligament, and from the sublingual by the mylo- hyoideus muscle. Embedded among its lobules are the facial artery and submaxillary ganglion. The excretory duct (Wharton’s) of the submaxillary gland com- mences upon the papilla, by the side of the frsenum linguae, and passes backwards beneath the mylo-hyoideus and resting upon the hyo-glossus muscle, to the middle of the gland, where it divides into numerous branches, which ramify through the structure of the gland, and termi- nate by caecal extremities. It lies in its course against the mucous membrane forming the floor of the mouth, and causes a prominence of that membrane. The Sublingual is an elongated and flattened gland, situated beneath _ ■ the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, on each side of the fraenum linguae. It is in relation, above, with the mucous membrane ; in front, with the depression by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw; externally, with the mylo-hyoideus muscle ; and, internally, with the hypoglossal nerve and genio-hyo-glossus muscle. It pours its secretion into the mouth bj’’ seven or eight small ducts, which open by small apertures on each side of the fraenum' linguae.

The smallest lobule is apparently composed of granules, which are minute cmcal pouches, formed by the dilatation of the extreme ramifi- cations of the ducts. These minute ducts unite to form lobular ducts, ;md the lobular ducts constitute by their union a single excretory duct. The caecal pouches are connected by areolo-fibrous tissue, so as to form a minute lobule; the lobules are held together by a more con- densed areolar’ layer; and the larger lobes are enveloped by a dense areolo-fibrous capsule, which is firmly attached to the deep cervical ' tascia. Fesse/s and Nerves.—The parotid gland is abundantly supplied with arteries by the external carotid; the submaxillary by the facial; and the sublingual by the sublingual branch of the lingual artery. The Nerves of the parotid gland are derived from the auricular branch of the inferior maxillar)’-,from the auricularis magnus, and from the nervi moUes accompanying the external carotid artery. The sub- maxillary gland is supplied by the branches of the submaxillary gan- . glion, and by filaments from the mylo-hyoidean nerve ; and the sub- lingual by filaments from the submaxillary ganglion and gustatory r nerve. PHARYNX. The pharynx the throat) is a musculo-membranous sac, ■ situated upon the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and extend- : ing from the base of the skull to a point corresponding with the cricoid - cartilage in front, and the fifth cendcal vertebra behind. It is com- . posed of mucous membrane, muscles, vessels, and nerves, and is in- vested by a strong fascia, situated between the mucous membrane and muscles, which serves to connect it with the basilar process of the oc- cipital bone and with the petrous portions of the temporal bones. Upon . its anterior part it is incomplete, and has opening into it seven for- amina, viz.— Posterior nares, two, Eustachian tubes, two. Mouth, Larynx, CEsophagus. The Posterior nares are the two large openings at the upper and ffront part of the pharynx. On each side of these openings, and slightly a above the posterior termination of the inferior turbinated bone, is the ; irregular depression in the mucous membrane, marking the entrance of t the Eustachian tube. Beneath the posterior nares is the large opening into the mouth, partly veiled by the soft palate; and, beneath the root of the tongue, the cordiform opening of the larynx. The oesophageal opening is the lower constricted portion of the pharynx.572 THE STOMACH. Fig. irO.* (Esophaffus.—The oesophagus (a’/ov, to bear, <p«y£/v, to eat) is a slightly flexuous canal, inclining to the left in the neck, to the right in the upper part of the thorax,+ and again to the left in its course through the posterior mediastinum ; it commences at the termination of the pharynx, opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and fifth cervical vertebra, and descends the neck behind and rather to the left of the trachea. It then passes behind the arch of the aorta, and along the posterior mediastinum, lying in front of the thoracic aorta, to the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, where it enters the ab- domen, and terminates at the car- diac orifice of the stomach at a point about opposite the tenth dor- sal vertebra. The oesophagus is flat- tened and narrow in the cervical region, and cylindrical in the rest of its course; its largest diameter is met with near the lower part of its course. THE STOMACH. The stomach is an expansion of the alimentary canal, situated in the left hypochondriac, and extending into the epigastric region. It is directed somewhat obliquely from above downwards, from left to right, and Irom before backwards; and in the female, where the injurious system of tight-lacing has been pursued, is longer than in the male. On account of the peculiarity of its form, it is divided into a greater or splenic, and a lesser or pyloric, end; a lesser curvature above, and a greater curvature below ; an anterior and a. posterior surface; a car- diac orifice, and a pyloric orifice. The great end is not only of large size, but expands beyond the point of entrance of the oesophagus, and * The pharynx laid open from behind. 1.

The pylorus is the small and contracted extremity of the organ; near its extremity is a small dilatation which was adled by Willis the antrum of the pylorus. The two curvatmres give attachment to the peritoneum ; the upper curve to the lesser omentum, and the lower to the greater omentum. The anterior surface looks upwards and forwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, (which separates it from the viscera of the thorax and from the six lower ribs,) with the left lobe of the liver, and in the epigastric region with the abdominal parietes. The posterior surface looks downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the dia- phragm, the pancreas, the third portion of the duodenum, the trans- verse meso-colon, the left kidney, and left supra-renal capsule ; this sur- face forms the anterior boundary of that cul-de-sac of the peritoneum which is situated behind the lesser omentum and extends into the greater omentum. SMALL INTESTINES. The small intestine is about twenty-five feet in length, and is divi- sible into three portions, dttodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The Duodenum (called "haihxithaxTuXov by Herophilus) is somewhat larger than the rest of the small intestines, and has received its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers. Commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the un- der surface of the liver; it next descendsin front of the right kidney, and then passes nearly transversely across the third lumbar vertebra; terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where it is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein. The first or oblique portion of its course, between two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by the perito- neum : it is in relation, above with the liver and neck of the gall- bladder ; in front with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and behind with the right border of the lesser omentum and its vessels. The second or perpendicular portion is situated altogether behind the peritoneum; it is in relation by its anterior surface with the com- mencement of the arch of the colon; by its posterior surface with the concave margin of the right kidney, the inferior vena cava, and the ductus communis choledochus; by its right border with the ascending colon; and by its left border with the pancreas. The ductus com- munis choledochus and pancreatic duct open into the internal and j posterior side of the perpendicular portion, a little below its middle. The third or transverse portion of the duodenum lies between the diverging layers of the transverse meso-colon, with which and with ^ the stomach it is in relation in front; above, it is in contact with the : lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery and vein ■ being interposed; and, behind, it rests upon the inferior vena cava and aorta.574 JEJUNUM. ILEUM, The Jejunum (jejunus, empty) is named from being generally found empty. It forms the upper two-fifths of the small intestine; commeno- ing at the duodenum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the ileum. It is thicker to the touch than the rest of the intestine, and has a pinkish tinge from containing more mucous membrane than the ileum. Fig. 180.* The TIeum (I’lxuv, to twist, to convolute) includes the remaining three- fifths of the small intestine. It is somewhat smaller in calibre, thinner in texture, and paler than the jejunum; but there is no mark by which to distinguish the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. It terminates in the right iliac fossa, by opening at an obtuse angle into the colon. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded, above and at the sides, by * A vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum, made in such a direction as to include the two orifices of the stomach. 1.

At about the lower third of the ileum a pouch-like process or diverticulum of the intestine is occasionally seen. This is a vestige of embryonic structure, and is formed by the obliteration of the vitelline duct at a short distance from the cylinder of the intestine. LARGE INTESTINE. The large intestine, about five feet in length, is sacculated in appear- ance, and is divided into the ccBc^m, colon, and rectum. The CcBCum (emeus, blind) is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, at the commencement of the large intestine. It is situated in the right iliac fossa, and is retained in its place by the peritoneum which passes over its anterior surface ; its posterior surface is connected by loose areolar tissue mth the iliac fascia. Attach- ed to its extremity is the appendix vermiformis, a long worm-shaped : tube, the rudiment of the lengthened caecum foimd in all mammiferous animals except man and the higher quadrumana. The appendix varies in length from one to five or six inches ; it is about equal in diame- • ter to a goose-quill, and is connected with the posterior and left aspect of the caecum near the extremity of ■ the ileum. It is usually more or less coiled upon itself, and retained in that coil by a falciform duplica- ; ture of peritoneum. Its canal is ex- itremely small, and the orifice by • which it opens into the caeemn not ■ unfrequently provided with an in- I complete valve. Occasionally the i peritoneum invests the caecum so ccompletely as to constitute a meso- f caecum, which permits of an un- rusual degree of movement in this I portion of the intestine, and serves to explain the occurrence,of hernia of • The cfficum, showing its appendix, the entrance of the ileum, and the ileo- • csBcal valve. 1.

The Colon is divided into ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending colon passes upwards from the right iliac fossa, through the right lumbar region, to the under surface of the liver. It then bends inwards and crosses the upper part of the umbilical region under the name of transverse colon; and, on the left side, descends {descending colon) through the left lumbar region to the left iliac fossa, where it makes a remarkable curve upon itself, which is called the sigmoid Jlexure. The ascending colon, the most dilated portion of the large intestine, next to the caecum, is retained in . its position in the abdomen either by the peritoneum passing simply in front of it or by a narrow meso- colon. It is in relation in front with the small intestine and abdomi- nal parietes; behind with the quadratus lumborum muscle and right kidney; internally with the small intestine and the perpendicular por- tion of the duodenum ; and by its upper extremity with the under sur- face of the liver and gall-bladder. The transverse colon, the longest j portion of the large intestine, forms a curve across the cavity of the j abdomen, the convexity of which looks forwards and sometimes down- ; wards. It is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, gall- bladder, stomach, and lower extremity of the spleen; by its lower sur- face, with the small intestine; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the great omentum and the abdominal parietes; and, by its posterior surface, with the transverse meso-colon. The descending colon is smaller in calibre, and is situated more deeply than the ascending colon. Its relations are precisely similar. The sigmoid flexure is the ( narrowest part of the colon; it curves in the first place upwards and then downwards, and to one or the other side, and is retained in its place by a meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the small intes- tine and abdominal parietes; behind, Avith the iliac fossa, and, on either side, witli the small intestine. The Rectum is the termination of the large intestine. It has re- ceived its name, not so much from the direction of its course, as from the straightness of its form in comparison with the colon. It descends, from opposite the left sacro-iliac sjnnphysis, in front of the sacrum, forming a gentle curve to the right side, and then returning to the j middle line; near the extremity of the coccyx it curves backwards to | terminate at the anus at about an inch in front of the apex of that bone. The rectum, therefore, forms a double flexure,in its course, the one being directed from side to side, the other from before backwards. It is smSler in calibre at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, but becomes gradually larger as it descends, and its lower extremity, pre- viously to its termination at the anus, forms a dilatation of consider- j able but variable magnitude. 1 With reference to its relations, the rectum is divided into three por- j tions; the ^rs<, including half its length, extends to about the middle of the sacrum, is completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected 1577 STRUCTURE OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. to the sacrum by means of the meso-rectum. It is in relation, above, with the left sacro-iliac symphysis; and, below, with the branches of the internal iliac arterj', and with the sacral plexus of nerves; one or two convolutions of the small intestine are interposed between the front of the rectum and the bladder, in the male; and between the rectum and the uterus with its appendages, in the female. The second portim, about three inches in length, is closely attached to the surface of the sacrum, and covered by peritoneum only in front; it is in re- lation by its lower part with the base of the bladder, vesiculse semi- nales, and prostate gland, and in the female with the vagina. The third portion curves backwards from opposite the prostate gland to terminate at the anus ; it is embraced by the levatores ani, and is about one inch and a half in length. It is separated from the membranous portion of the urethra by a triangular space; in the female this space intervenes between the vagina and the rectum, and constitutes by its base the perineiun. The Anus is situated at a little more than an inch in front of the extremity of the coccyx. The integument aroimd it is covered with hairs, and is thrown into numerous radiated plaits which are obliterated during the passage of faeces. The margin of the anus is provided with an abundance of sebiparous glands, and the epiderma may be seen ter- ; minating by a fringed and scalloped border, at a few lines above the , extremity of the opening. STRUCTURE OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. The pharynx has three coats; a mucous coat, a fibrous coat derived ■ firom the pharjTigeal fascia, and a muscular layer. The oesophagus has but two coats, the mucous and muscular. The stomach and intestines have three, mitcous and muscular, and an external serous investment, derived from the peritoneum. ^lucous Coat,—The mucous membrane of the mouth invests the Avhole internal surface of that cavity, and is reflected along the parotid, isubmaxillar}', and sublingual ducts, into the corresponding glands. It l terminates anteriorly upon the outer margin of the red border of the lips, and posteriorly is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx. I The raucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with the mucous Llining of the Eustachian tubes, the nares, the mouth, and the larynx. 1 In the oesophagus it is thick, very loosely connected with the muscular c coat, and disposed in longitudinal plicce. In the stomach the mucous rmembrane is thin and vascular at the great extremity, and becomes uhicker and lighter in colour towards the pyloric extremity. It is t formed into plaits or rttga, which are disposed for the most part in a longitudinal direction. The rugae are most numerous towards the r lesser end of the stomach ; while around the cardiac orifice they bassume a radiated arrangement. At the pylorus the mucous mem- p p578 STRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMHRANE. brane forms a circular or spiral fold which constitutes a part of the apparatus of the pyloric valve. In the lower half of the duodenum, the whole length of the jejunum, and the upper part of the ileum, it fonns valvular folds called valvulce conniventcs.^ which are several lines in breadth in the lower part of the duodenum and upper portion of the jejunum, and diminish gradually in size towards each extremity. These folds do not entirely surround the cylinder of the intestine, hut extend for about one-half or three-fourths of its circumference. In the lower half of the ileum the mucous lining is without folds; hence the thinness of the coats of this intestine as compared with the jejunum and duodenum. At the termination of the ileum in the caecum, the mucous membrane forms two folds, which are strength- | ened by the muscular coat, and project into the caecum. These are : the ileo-ccBcal valve (valvula Bauhini). In the caecum and colon the mucous membrane is raised into crescentic folds, which correspond with the sharp edges of the sacculi; and, in the rectum, it forms three valvular folds,* one of which is situated near the commencement of the intestine ; the second, extending from the side of the tube, is placed opposite the middle of the sacrum ; and the third, which is the largest and most constant, projects from the anterior wall of | the intestine opposite the base of the bladder. Besides these folds, : the membrane in the empty state of the intestine is thrown into longitudinal plaits, somewhat similar to those of the oesophagus; these have been named the columns of the rectum. The mucous membrane of the rectum is connected to the muscular coat by a very loose areolar tissue, as in the oesophagus. Structure of Mucous Membrane.—Mucous membrane is analogous to the cutaneous covering of the exterior of the body, and resembles that tissue very closely in its structure. It is composed of three layers, an epithelium, & proper mucous, and fibrous layer. The Epitheliumis the epiderma of the mucous membrane. Through- out the pharynx and oesophagus it resembles the epiderma, both in appearance and character. It is continuous with the epiderma of the skin at the margin of the lips, and terminates by an irregular border at the cardiac orifice of the stomach. At the opposite extremity of the canal it terminates by a scalloped border just within the verge of the anus. In the mouth it is composed of laminae of cytoblasts, cells, and polyhedral scales (fig. 168), Each cell and each scale possesses a central nucleus, and within the nucleus are one or more nucleus-cor- puscles. According to Mr. Nasmyth,+ the deepest lamina of the epithelium appears to consist of nuclei (cytoblasts) only; in the next the investing vesicle or cell is developed; the cells by degrees enlarge * Mr. Houston, “On the Mucous Membrane of the Rectum.” Dublin Hos- ! pital Reports, vol. v. t Investigations into the structure of the Epithelium, presented to the me- , dical section of the British Medical Association, in 1839, published in a work : entitled “ Three Memoirs on the Development of the teeth and epithelium,” 1841. i579 PAPILLARY LAYER. FIBROUS LAYER. and become flattened, and in the superficial laminm are converted into thin scales. The nuclei, the cells, and the scales are connected together by a glutinous fluid of the consistence of jelly, which contains an abundance of minute opaque granules. The scales of the super- ficial layer overlap each other by their margins. During the natural functions of the mucous membrane the superficial scales exfoliate continually and give place to the deeper layers. In the stomach and intestines these bodies are pyriform in shape, and have a columnar arrangement, the apices being applied to the papillary surface of the membrane, and the bases forming, by their approximation, the free intestinal surface. Each column is provided with a central nucleus and nucleus-corpuscle, which gives its middle a swollen appear- ance ; and, from the transparency of its structure, the nucleus may be seen through the base of the column, when examined from the surface. Around the circular villi, the cokunns, from being placed perpendicu- larly to the surface, have a radiated arrangement. The columnar epithelium is produced, in the same manner with the laminated epithelium, in cytoblasts, cells, and columns, and the latter are contin- ually thrown off to give place to successive layers. The Proper mucous, or Papillary layer is analogous to the papillary layer of the skin, and, like it, is the formative structure by which the epithelium is produced. Its surface presents several varieties of appearance when examined in different parts of its extent. In the stomach it forms polyhedral cells, into the floor of which the gastric follicles open. In the small intestine it presents numerous minute, projecting papill®, called villi. The villi are of two kinds, cylindrical and laminated, and so abundant, as to give to the entire surface a beautiful velvety appearance. In the large intestine the surface is composed of a fine network of minute polyhedral cells, more numerous than those of the stomach, but resembling them in receiving the secre- tion from numerous perpendicular follicles into their floors. The Fibrous layer (sub-mucous, nervous) is the membrane of sup- port to the mucous membrane, as is the corium to the papillary layer of the skin. It gives to the mucous membrane its strength and resistance, is but loosely connected with the mucous layer, but is firmly adherent to the muscular stratum, and is called, in the older works on anatomy, the “ nei’vous coat." Glands.—In the loose areolar tissue connecting the mucous with the fibrous layer, are situated the glands and follicles belonging to the mucous membrane; these are the— Pharyngeal glands. Oesophageal glands. Gastric follicles. Duodenal glands (Brunner s), Glandulae solitarise, Glandulae aggregate (Peyer’s), Simple follicles (Lieberkiihn’s).lillUNNKu’S AND PEVER’S GLANDS. .580 The J’haryngeal (jlands are situated in considerable numbers beneatli the mucous membrane of the pharynx, particularly around the pos- terior nares. Two of these glands, of larger size than the rest, and lobulated in structure, occupy the margin of the opening of the Eusta- chian tube. The Qisopliageal glands are small lobulated bodies, situated in the sub-mucous tissue, and opening upon the surface of the cesophagus by a long excretory duct, which passes obliquely through the mucous membrane. The Gastric follicles are long tubular follicular glands, situated perpendicularly side by side in every part of the mucous membrane of the stomach. At their terminations they are dilated into small lateral pouches, which give them a clustered appearance. This character is more clearly exhibited at the pyloric than at the cardiac end of the stomach. They are intended, very probably, for the secretion of the gastric fluid. The Duodenal, or Brunner's* glands, are small flattened granular bodies, compared collectively by Von Brunn to a second pancreas. They resemble in structure the small salivary glands, so abundant beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth and lips ; and, like them, they open upon the surface by minute excretory ducts. They are limited to the duodenum. The Solitary glands are of two kinds, those of the small and those of the large intestine. The former are small circular patches, surrounded by a zone or wreath of simple follicles. When opened, they are seen to consist of a small flattened saccular cavity, containing a mucous secretion, but having no excretory duct. They are chiefly found in the lower part of the ileum. The solitary glands of the large intestine are most abundant in the caecum and appendix caeci; thej’’ are small circular prominences, flattened upon the surface, and perforated in the centre by a minute excretory opening. The Aggregate, or Beyer's \ glands, are situated near the lower end of the ileum, and occupy that portion of the intestine which is opposite the attachment of the mesentery. To the naked ejm they present the appearance of oval disks, covered with small irregular fissures; but with the aid of the microscope they are seen to be composed of numerous small circular patches, surrounded by simple follicles, like the solitary glands of the small intestine. Each patch corresponds with a flattened and closed sac, situated beneath the membrane, but having no excretorj^ opening, and the interspace between the patches is occupied by flattened villi. The Simple follicles, or follicles of Lieberkiihn, are small pouches of the mucous layer, dispersed in immense numbers over every part of the mucous membrane. * John Conrad von Bnmn: “ Glandulas Duodeni seu Pancreas Secundarium,” 1715. t John Conrad Peyer, an anatomist of Schaffhausen, in Switzerland. His essay, “De Glandulis Intestinorum,” was published in 1677.MUSCLES OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. 581 Muscular Coat.—The muscular coat of the pharynx consists of five pairs of muscles, which have been already described. The mus- cular coat of the rest of the alimentary canal is composed of two planes of fibres, an external longitiulinal, and an internal circular. The (Esophagus is very muscular ; its longitudinal fibres are con- tinuous above with the pharynx, and are attached in front to the vertical ridge on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage; the uppermost circular fibres are also attached to the cricoid cartilage. Below, both sets of fibres are continued upon the stomach. Besides the fibres possessed by the oesophagus in common with the rest of the alimentary canal, two special muscles have been described by Hyrtl under the names of Broncho-oesophageal and Pleuro-oesophageal. The Broncho-cesophageal muscle arises as a broad fasciculus from the posterior surface of the left bronchus, and is lost, after a course of two or three inches in length, among the longitudinal fibres of the left side of the oesophagus. The Pleuro-cesopJuxgeal muscle arises from the left wall of the posterior mediastinum behind the commencement of the descending aorta, and curves around that vessel to mingle its fibres with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus. On the Stomach the longitudinal fibres are most apparent along the lesser curve, and the circular at the smaller end. At the pylorus the latter are aggregated into a thick circular ring, which, with the spiral fold of mucous membrane found in this situation, constitutes the pyloric valve. At the great end of the stomach a new order of fibres is intro- duced, having for their object to strengthen and compress that ex- tremity of the organ. They are directed more or less horizontally from the great end towards the lesser end, and are generally lost upon the sides of the stomach at about its middle; these are the oblique fibres. The Small intestine is provided with both layers of fibres, equally distributed over the entire surface. At the termination of the ileum the circular fibres are continued into the two folds of the ileo-caecal valve, while the longitudinal fibres pass onwards to the large intestine. In the large intestine the longitudinal fibres commence at the appendix vermiformis and are collected into three bands, an anterior, broad, and two posterior and narrower bands. These bands are nearly one-half ■ shorter than the intestine, and serve to maintain the sacculated struc- ; ture which is characteristic of the caecum and colon. In the descending colon the posterior bands usually unite and form a single band. From ■ this point the bands are continued downwards upon the sigmoid : flexure to the rectum, around which they spread out and form a thick . and very muscular longitudinal layer. The circular fibres in the ^ caecum and colon are exceedingly thin; in the rectum they are thicker, . and at its lower extremity they are aggregated into the thick muscular ring which is known as the internal sphincter ani. Between the lat- ter and the mucous membrane are several narrow fasciculi of longitu- dinal muscular fibres, somewhat more than an inch in length, which have been described by Plorner of Philadelphia.582 THE EIVER. Serous Coat.—The pharynx and oesophagus have no covering of. serous membrane. The alimentary canal within the abdomen has a serous layer, derived from the peritoneum. The Stomach is completely surrounded by peritoneum, excepting along the line of junction of the great and lesser omentum. The or oblique portion of the duodenum is also completely included by the serous membrane, with the exception of the points of attachment of the omenta. The descending portion has merely a partial covering on its anterior surface. The tranverse portion is also behind the peritoneum, being situated between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon, and has but a partial covering. The rest of the small intestine is completely invested by it, excepting along the concave bor- der to which the mesentery is attached. The caecum is more or less in- vested by the peritoneum, the more frequent disposition being that in which the intestine is surrounded for three-fourths only of its circum- ference. The ascending and the descending colon are covered by the serous membrane only in front. The transverse colon is invested completely, with the exception of the lines of attachment of the greater omentum and transverse meso-colon. And the sigmoid flexure is entirely surrounded, with the exception of the part corresponding with the junction of the left meso-colon. The upper third of the rectum is completely enclosed by the peritoneum; the middle third has an anterior covering only, and the inferior third none whatso- ever. Vessels and Nerves.— The Arteries of the alimentary canal, as the}' supply the tube from above downwards, are the pterygo-palatine, ascending pharyngeal, superior thyroid, and inferior thyroid, in the neck; oesophageal, in the thorax; gastric, hepatic, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, in the abdomen; and inferior mesenteric, iliac, and internal pudic, in the pelvis. The veins from the abdominal ali- mentary canal unite to form the vena portae. The lymphatics and lacteals open into the thoracic duct. The Nerves of the pharynx and oesophagus are derived from the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and sympathetic. The nerves of the stomach are the pneumogastric, and sympathetic branches from the solar plexus; and those of the intestinal canal are the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. The extremity of the rectum is supplied by the inferior sacral nerves from the spinal cord. THE LIVER. The liver is a conglomerate gland of large size, appended to the alimentary canal, and performing the double office of separating impu- rities from the venous blood of the chylo-poietic viscera previously to its return into the general venous circulation, and of secreting a fluid necessary to chylification,.the bile. It is the largest organ in the body,583 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER, weighing about four pounds, and measuring through its longest diame- ter about twelve inches. It is situated in the right hypochondriac re- gion, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondriac, freijuently reaching, by its left extremity, the upper end of the spleen. It is placed obliquely in the abdomen; its convex surface looking up- wards and forwards, and the concave downwards and backwards. The anterior border is sharp and free, and marked by a deep notch, and the posterior rounded and broad. It is in relation, superiorly and pos- teriorly, with the diaphragm; and inferiorly, with the stomach, as- cending portion of the duodenum, transverse colon, right supra-reiial capsule, and right kidney; and corresponds, by its free border, with the lower margin of the ribs. Fig. 182.* Ligaments.—The liver is retained in its place by five ligaments; four of which are duplicatures of the peritoneum, and are situated on the convex surface of the organ; the fifth is a fibrous cord which passes through a fissure in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava.

Between its two layers, in the anterior and free margin, is the round ligament. The Lateral ligaments are fonned by the two layers of peritoneum, which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior border of the liver; they correspond with its lateral lobes. The Coronary ligament is formed by the separation of the two layers fanning the lateral ligaments near their point of convergence. The posterior layer is continued unbroken from one lateral ligament into the other; but the anterior quits the posterior at each side, and is con- tinuous with the corresponding layer of the longitudinal ligament. In this way a large oval surface on the posterior border of the liver is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the diaphragm by areolo- fibrous tissue. This space is forced principally by the right lateral ligament, and is pierced near its left extremity bj' the inferior vena cava, previously to the passage of that vessel through the tendinous opening in the diaphragm. The Round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein, and situated between the two layers of perito- neum in the anterior liorder of the longitudinal ligament. It may be traced from the umbilicus, along the longitudinal fissure of the under surface of the liver to the inferior vena cava, to which it is con- nected. Fissures.—The under surface of the liver is marked by five fissures, which divide its surface into five compartments or lobes, two principal and three minor lobes; they are the— Fissures. Longitudinal fissure. Fissure of the ductus venosus. Transverse fissure. Fissure for the gall bladder Fissure for the vena cava. Lohes. Right lobe, Left lobe, Lobus quadratus, Lobus Spigelii, Lobus caudatus. The Longitudinal fissure is a deep groove ranning from the notch upon the anterior margin of the liver, to the posterior border of the organ. At about one-third from its posterior extremity it is joined by a short but deep fissure, the transverse, which meets it transversely from the under part of the right lobe. The longitudinal fissure in front of this junction lodges the fibrous cord of the umbilical vein, and is generally crossed by a band of hepatic substance called the pons hepatis. The Fissure for the ductus venosus is the shorter portion of the longi- tudinal fissure, extending from the junctional termination of the trans- A'^erse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and containing a small fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus venosus. This fissure is there- fore but a part of the longitudinal fissure. The Transverse fissure is the short and deep fissure, about two inches I I \ 1 i585 OF THE LIVER. in length, througli which the hepatic ducts, hepatic arter)’-, and portal vein enter the liver. Hence this fissure was considered by the older anatomists as the gate (poi-ta) of the liver ; and the large vein entering the organ at this point, the portal vein. At their entrance into the transverse fissiure the branches of the hepatic duct are the most anterior, next those of the artery, and most posteriorly the portal vein. Fig. 183.* tX The Fissure for tliegall-hladder is a shallow fossa extending forwards, parallel with the longitudinal fissure, from the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the free border of the liver, where it frequently forms a notch. The Fissure for the vena cava is a deep and short fissure, occasion- ally a circular tunnel, which proceeds from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and lodges the inferior vena cava. These five fissures taken collectively resemble an inverted y, the base corresponding with the firee margin of the liver, and the apex with its posterior border.

Lobes.—The Itiyld lobe is four or six times larger than the left, from which it is separated, on the concave surface, by the longitudinal fissure, and, on the convex, by the longitudinal ligament. It is marked upon its under surface by the transverse fissure, and by the fissures for the gall-bladder and vena cava; and presents three de- pressions, one, in front, for the curve of the ascending colon, and two, behind, for the right supra-renal capsule and kidney. The Left lobe is small and flattened, convex upon its upper surface, and concave below, where it lies in contact with the anterior surface of the stomach. It is sometimes in contact by its extremity with the upper end of the spleen, and is in relation, by its posterior border, with the cardiac orifice of the stomach and left pneumogastric nerve. The Ijohus quadratus is a quadrilateral lobe situated on the under surface of the right lobe; it is bounded, in front., by the free border of the liver ; behind, by the transverse fissure ; to the right, by the gall- bladder ; and to the left, by the longitudinal fissure. The Lobus Spigelii* is a small triangular lobe, also situated on the under surface of the right lobe; it is bounded, in front, by the trans- verse fissure ; and, on the sides, by the fissures for the ductus venosus and vena cava. The Lobus caudatus is a small tail-like appendage of the lobus Spigelii, from which it runs outwards like a crest into the right lobe, and serves to separate the right extremity of the transverse fissure from the commencement of the fissure for the vena cava. In some persons this lobe is well marked, in others it is small and ill-defined. Reverting to the comparison of the fissures with an -inverted y, it will be observed, that the quadrilateral interval, in front of the trans- verse bar, represents the lobus quadratus ; the triangular space behind the bar, the lobus Spigelii; and the apex of the letter, the point of union between the inferior vena cava and the remains of the ductus venosus. Vessels and Nerves.—The vessels entering into the structure of the liver are also five in number ; they are the Hepatic arter}’-. Portal vein. Hepatic veins. Hepatic ducts. Lymphatics. The Hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct enter the liver at the tranverse fissure, and ramify through portal canals to every part of * Adrian Spigel, a Belgian physician, professor at Padua after Casserius in 1616. He assigned considerable importance to this little lobe, but it had been described by Sylvius full sixty years before his time.587 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. the organ ; so that their general direction is from below upwards, and from the centre towards the circumference. The Hepatic veins commence at the circumference, and proceed from before backwards, to open into the vena cava, on the posterior border of the liver. Hence the branches of the two veins cross each other in their course. The portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct are moreover enve- loped in a loose areolar tissue, the capsule of Glisson, which permits them to contract upon themselves when emptied of their contents; the hepatic veins, on the contraiy, are closely adherent by their parietes to the surface of the canals in which they run, and are unable to contract. By these characters the anatomist is enabled, in any section of the liver, to distinguish at once the most minute branch of the portal vein from an hepatic vein: the former will be found more or less collapsed, and always accompanied by an artery and duct, and the latter widely open and solitary. • The Lymphatics of the liver are described in the Chapter dedicated to those vessels. The Nerves of the liver are derived from the systems both of animal and organic hfe ; the former proceed from the right phrenic and pneu- mogastric nerves, and the latter from the hepatic plexus. Structure and Mimite Anatomy of the Liver. The Liver is composed of lobtdes, of a connecting medium called Glisson's capside, of the ramifications of the portal vein, hepatic duct, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves, and is enclosed and retained in its situation by the peritoneum. The Lobules are small granular millet seed, of an irregular form, and presenting a number of round- ed prominences on their surface. When divided longitudinally, they have a foliated appearance, and transversely, a polygonal outline, with sharp or rounded angles, ac- cording to the smaller or greater qiuintity of Glisson’s capsule con- tained in the liver. Each lobule is divided upon its exterior into a base and a capsular surface. The base corresponds with one extremity of the lobule, is flattened, and rests upon an hepatic vein, which is * The lobules of the liver.

Tlie capsular surface includes the rest of the periphery of the lobule, and has received its designation from being en- closed in an areolar capsule derived from the capsule of Glisson. In the centre of each lobule is a small vein, the intralobular, which is formed by the convergence of six or eight minute venules from the rounded promi- nences of the periphery. The intralobular vein thus constituted takes its course through thecentre of the longitudinal axis of the lobule, pierces the middle of its base, and opens into the sublobular vein. The periphery of the lobule, with the exception of its base, which is always closely attached to a sublobular vein, is connected by means of its areolar capsule with the capsular surfaces of surrounding lobides. The in- ternal between the lobules is the interlobular fissure, and the angular interstices formed by the apposition of several lobules are the ivterldxur lar spaces. The lobules of the centre of the liver are angular, and somewhat smaller than those of the surface, from the greater compression to which they are submitted. The superficial lobules are incomplete, and give to the surface of the organ the appearance and all the advantages resulting from an examination of a transverse section. “ Each lobule is composed of a plexus of biliary ducts, of a venous plexus, formed by branches of the portal vein, of a branch (intralobular), of an hepatic vein, and of minute arteries ; nerves and absorbents, it is to be presumed, also enter into their formation, but cannot be traced into them.” “ Examined, with the microscope, a lobule is apparently composed of numerous minute bodies of a yellowish coloim and of various forms, connected with each other by vessels. These minute bodies are the acini of Malpighi.” “ If an uninjected lobule be ex- amined and contrasted with an injected lobule, it will be found that the acini of Malpighi in the former are identical with the injected lobular biliary plexus in the latter, and the blood-vessels in both will be easily distinguished from the ducts.”+ Glisson's capsule is the areolo-fibrous tissue which envelopes the he- patic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, during their passage through the right border of the lesser omentum, and which continues to sur- round them to their ultimate distribution in the substance of the lobules. It forms for each lobule a distinct capsule, which invests it on all sides * A longitudinal section of two lobules. 1.

Trans. 1833, from which this and the other paragraphs within inverted commas, on the structure of the liver, are quoted,STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 589 wdth the exception of its base, connects all the lobules together, and constitutes the proper capsule of the entire organ. But Glisson’s cap- sule is not mere areolar tissue ; “ it is to the liver what the pia mater is to the brain; it is a cellulo-vascular membrane, in which the vessels divide and subdivide to an extreme degree of minuteness ; which lines the portal canals, forming sheaths for the larger vessels contained in them, and a web in which the smaller vessels ramify ; which enters the interlobular fissures, and with the vessels forms the capsules of the lobules; and which finally enters the lobules, and with the blood-vessels expands itself over the secreting biliary ducts.” Hence arises a natural division of the capsule into three portions, a vaginal, an interlobular, and a lobular portion. The vaginal portion is that which invests the hepatic artery, hepatic duct, and portal vein, in the portal canals; in the larger canals it completely surrounds these vessels, but in the smaller is situated only on that side which is occupied by the artery and duct. The in- terlobular portion occupies the interlobular fissures and spaces, and the lobular portion forms the supporting tissue to the substance of the lobules. The Portal vein, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, ramifies through its structure in canals, which resemble, by their surfaces, the external superficies of the liver, and are formed by the capsular sur- faces of the lobules. These are the portal canals, and contain, besides the portal vein with its ramifications, the artery and duct with their branches. In the larger canals, the vessels are separated from the parietes by a web of Glisson’s capsule; but, in the smaller, the portal vein is in contact with the surface of the canal for about two-thirds of its cylin- der, the opposite third being in relation with ’the artery and duct and their investing capsule. If, therefore, the portal vein were laid open by a longitudinal incision in one of these smaller canals, the coats being transparent, the outline of the lobules^ bounded by their inter- lobular fissures, would be as distinctly seen as upon the external sur- face of the liver, and the smaller venous branches would be observed entering the interlobular spaces. The branches of the portal vein are, the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The vaginal branches are those which, being given oflF in the portal canals, have to pass through the sheath (vagina) of Glisson’s capsule, previously to entering the interlobular spaces. In tliis course they form an intricate plexus, the vaginal plexus, which, depending for its existence on the capsule of Glisson, necessarily surrounds the vessels, as does that capsule in the larger canals, and occupies the capsular side only in the smaller canals. The interlobular branches are given off from the vaginal portal plexus where it exists, and directly from the portal veins, in that part of the smaller canals where the coats of the vein are in contact with the walls of the canal. They then enter the interlobular spaces and divide into branches, which cover with their ramifications every part of the surface of the lobules,STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 590 with the exception of their bases and those extremities of the super- ficial lobules which appear upon the surfaces of the liver. The inter- lobular veins communicate freely with each other, and with the corre- sponding veins of adjoining fissures, and establish a general portal anastomosis throughout the entire liver. The lobular branches are derived from the interlobular veins ; they form a plexus within each lobule, and converge from the circumference towards the centre, where they terminate in the minute radicles of the intralobular vein. “ This plexus, interposed between the interlobular portal veins and the intralobular hepatic vein, constitutes the venous part of the lobule, and may be called the lohdar venous plexus." The irregular islets of the substance of the lobules, seen between the meshes of this plexus by means of the microscope, are the acini of Malpighi, and are por- tions of the lobular biliary plexus. The portal vein returns the venous blood from the chylopoietic viscera, to be circulated through the lobules ; it also receives the venous blood which results from the distribution of the hepatic artery. The Hepatic duct, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, divides into branches, which ramify through the portal canals, with the portal vein and hepatic artery, to terminate in the substance of the lobules. Its branches, like those of the portal vein, are vaginal, inter- lobular, and lobular. The Vaginal branches ramify through the capsule of Glisson, and form a vaginal biliary plexus, which, like the vaginal portal plexus, surrounds the vessels in the large canals, but is deficient on that side of the smaller canals near which the duct is placed. The branches given off by the vaginal biliary plexus are interlobular and lobular. The interlobular branches proceed from the vaginal biliary plexus where it exists, and directly from the hepatic duct on that side of the smaller canals against which the duct is placed. They enter the inter- lobular spaces, and ramify upon the capsular surface of the lobules in the interlobular fissures, where they communicate freel}’’ with each other. The lobular ducts are derived chiefly from the interlobular; but to those lobules forming the walls of the portal canals, they pass directly from the vaginal plexus. They enter the lobule, and form a plexus in its interior, the lobular biliary plexus, which constitutes the principal part of the substance of the lobule. The ducts terminate either in loops or in caecal extremities. The coats of the ducts are very vascular, and are supplied with a number of mucous follicles, which are distributed irregularl)’^ in the larger, but are arranged in two parallel longitudinal rows in the smaller ducts. The Hepatic artery enters the liver with the portal vein and hepatic duct, and ramifies with those vessels through the portal canals. Its branches are the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The mginal branches, like those of the portal vein and hepatic duct, form a vaginal plexus, which exists throughout the whole extent of the portal canals,591 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. with the exception of that side of the smaller canals which corresponds with the artery. The interlobular branches, arising from the vaginal plexus and from the parietal side of the artery (in the smaller canals), ramify through the interlobular fissures, and are principally distributed to the coats of the interlobular ducts. “ From the superficial interlobular fissures small arteries emerge, and ramify in the proper capsule, on the convex and concave surface of the liver, and in the ligaments. These are the capsular arteries." Where the capsule is well developed, “ these vessels cover the surfaces of the liver with a beautiful plexus,” and “ anastomose with branches of the phrenic, internal mammary, and supra-renal arteries,” and with the epigastric. The Lobular branches, extremely minute and few in number, are the nutrient vessels of the lobules, and terminate in the lobular venous plexus. All the venous blood resulting from the distribution of the hepatic artery, even that from the vasa vasorum of the hepatic veins, is re- turned into the portal vein. The Hepatic veins commence in the substance of each lobule by minute venules, which receive the blood from the lobular venous plexus, and converge to form the intralobular vein. The intralobular vein passes through the central axis of the lobule, and through the middle of its base, to terminate in a sublobular vein; and the union of the sublobular veins constitutes the hepatic trunks, which open into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic venous system consists, therefore, of three sets of vessels; intralobular veins, sublobular veins, and hepatic trunks. The Sublobular veins are contained in canals formed solely by the bases of the lobules, with which, from the absence of Glisson’s capsule, they are in immediate contact. Their coats are thin and transparent; and, if they be laid open by a longitudinal incision, the bases of the lobules will be distinctly seen, separated by interlobular fissures, and perforated through the centre by the opening of the intralobular vein. The Hepatic trunks are formed by the union of the sublobular veins; they are contained in canals (hepatic-venous) similar in structure to the portal canals, and lined by a prolongation of the proper capsule. They proceed from before backwards, and terminate, by two large openings (corresponding to the right and left lobe of the liver) and se- veral smaller apertures, in the inferior vena cava. Summary.—The liver has been shewn to be composed of lobules; the lobules (excepting at their bases) are invested and connected to- gether, the vessels supported, and the whole organ enclosed, by Glis- son's capsule ; and they are so arranged, that the base of every lobule in the fiver is in contact with an hepatic vein (sublobular). The Portal vein distributes its numberless branches through portal canals, which are channeled through every part of the organ; it brings the returning blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; it collects also theI 592 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OK THE LIVER. venous Wood from the ultimate ramifications of the hepatic arterj' in j; the liver itself. It gives off branches in the canals, wliich are called i vaginal, and form a venous vaginal plexus ; these give off interlobular < branches, and the latter enter the lobules and fonn lobulur veiious b plexuses, from the blood circulating in which the bile is secreted. * The Bile in the lobule is received by a network of minute ducts, , the lobular biliary plexus; it is conveyed from the lobule into the interlobular ducts ; it is thence poured into hWiary vaginal jjkxus ' ; of the portal canals, and thence into the excreting ducts, by which it is carried to the duodenum and gall-bladder, after being mingled in j its course with the mucous secretion from the numberless muciparous ! follicles in the walls of the ducts. The Hepatic artery distributes branches through every portal canal; gives off vaginal branches which form a vaginal hepatic plexus, from which the interlobular branehes arise, and these latter terminate ; ultimately in the lobular venous plexuses of the portal vein. The artery ramifies abundantly in the coats of the hepatic ducts, enabling j them to provide their mucous secretion ; and supplies the vasa vaso- rum of the portal and hepatic veins, and tlie nutrient vessels of the entire organ. i The Hepatic veins commence in the centre of each lobule by minute radicles, which collect the impure blood from the lobular venous plexus and convej’’ it into the intralobular veins ; these open into the svh- lobular veins, and the sublobular veins unite to form the large hepatic trunks by which the blood is conveyed into the vena cava. Physiological and pathological deductions.—The physiological deduc- tion arising out of this anatomical arrangement is, that the bUe is wholly secreted from venous blood, and not from a mixed venous and ar- terial blood, as stated by Muller; for although the portal vein re- ceives its blood from two sources, viz. from the chylopoietic viscera and from the capillaries of the hepatic artery, yet the verj-- fact of the blood of the latter vessel having passed through its capillaries into the portal vein, or in extremely small quantity into the capillary network of the lobular venous plexus, is sufficient to establish its venous character.* The pathological deductions depend upon the following facts: — Each lobule is a perfect gland ; of uniform structure, of uniform colour, and possessing the same degree of vascularity throughout. It is the seat of a double venous circulation, the vessels of the one (Jiepatic) being situated in the centre of the lobule, and those of the other (portal) in the circumference- Now the colour of the lobule, as of the entire liver, depends chiefly upon the proportion of blood con- tained within these two sets of vessels; and so long as the circulation ' is natural, the colour will be uniform. But the instant that any cause ; is developed which shall interfere with the free circulation of either, there will be an immediate diversity in the colour of the lobule. ♦ For arguments on this contested question, see the article “Liver,” in the “ Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,” edited by Dr. Todd. 'GALL-BLADDER. 593 Thus, if there be any impediment to the free circulation of the venous blood through the heart or lungs, the circulation in the hepatic veins will be retarded, and the sublobular and the intralobular veins n-ill become congested, giving rise to a more or less extensive redness in the centre of each of the lobules, while the marginal or non-con- . gested portion presents a distinct border of a yellowish white, yellow, or green colour, according to the quantity and quality of the bile it may contain. “This is ^pasidve congestion' of the liver, the usual ,:and natimil state of the organ after death);” and, as it commences wth the hepatic vein, it may be called the first stage of hepatic-venous congestion. But if the causes which produced this state of congestion continue, ' or be from the beginning of a more active kind, the congestion will extend through the lobular venous plexuses “ into those branches of the portal vein situated in the interlobular fissures, but not to those in the spaces, which being larger, and giving origin to those in the fis- sures, are the last to be congested.” In this second stage the liver : has a mottled appearance, the non-congested substance is arranged in •isolated, circular, and ramose patches, in the centres of which the • spaces and parts of the fissures are seen. This is an extended degree of hepatic-venous congestio?i; it is “ active congestion" of the liver, and very commonly attends disease of the heart and lungs. These are instances of partial congestion, but there is sometimes 'general congestion oi the organ. “In general congestion the whole liver is of a red colour, but the central portions of the lobules are . usually of a deeper hue than the marginal portions.” GALL-BLADDER. The Gall-bladder (fig. 138) is the reservoir of the bile ; it is a py- rriform sac, situated in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of : the liver, and extending from the right extremity of the transverse f. fissure to the free margin. It is divided into a body, fundus, and r neck ; the fimdus or broad extremity in the natural position of the i.fiver is placed dowTiwards, and frequently projects beyond the free irmargin of the liver, while the neck, small and constricted, is directed ; upwards. This sac is composed of three coats, serous, fibrous, and tamcous. The serous coat is partial, is derived from the peritoneum, rand covers that side only which is unattached to the liver. The ^middle or fibrous coat is a thin but strong fibrous layer, connected on v)ne side to the liver, and on the other to the peritoneum. The in- 'f'emal or mucous coat is but loosely attached to the fibrous layer ; : t is everywhere raised into minute rugse, which give it a beautifully ■> .'eticulated appearance, and forms, at the neck of the sac, a spiral valve. It is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous • nembrane lining all the ducts of the liver, and through the ductus ' :omraunis choledochus, with the mucous membrane of the alimentary .anal.THE PANCREAS. .104 The Biliari! ducts are, the ductus communis choledochus, the cystic, and the hepatic duct. The Ductus communis choledochus hilis, recipio) is the common excretory duct of the liver and gall-bladder ; it is about three inches in length, and commences at the papilla situated on the inner 1 side of the cylinder of the perpendicular portion of the duodenum. Passing obliquely between the mucous and muscular coat, it ascends behind the duodenum, and through the right border of the lesser omen- tum; and divides into two branches, the cystic duct and the hepatic duct. It is constricted at its commencement in the duodenum, and j becomes dilated in its progress upwards. | The Q/siic duct, about an inch in length, passes outwards from the preceding to the neck of the gall-bladder, with which it is con- ; tinuous. The Hepatic duct continues onwards to the transverse fissure of the i liver, and divides into two branches, which ramify through the portal canals to every part of the liver. The coats of the hepatic ducts are an external or fibrous, and an in- ternal or mucous coat. The external coat is composed of a contractile fibrous tissue, which is probably muscular ; but its muscularity has ^ not yet been demonstrated in the human subject. The mucous coat ; is continuous on the one hand with the lining membrane of the ! hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and on the other with that of the ' duodenum. t Vessels and Nerves.—The gall-bladder is supplied with blood by j the cystic artery, a branch of the hepatic. Its veins return their j blood into the portal vein. The nerves are derived fi-om the hepatic 1 plexus. THE PANCREAS. The Pancreas is a long, flattened, conglomerate gland, analogous to the sahvary glands. It is about six inches in length, and between three and four ounces in weight; is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the stomach, and resting on the aorta, vena portse, inferior vena cava, the origin of the superior mesen- teric artery, and the left kidney and supra-renal capsule; opposite the first and second lumbar vertebrae. It is divided into a body, a greater and a smaller extremity: the great end or head is placed towards the right, and is surrounded by the curve of the duodenum ; the lesser end extends to the left as far as the spleen. The anterior surface of the body of the pancreas is covered by the ascending posterior layer of peritoneum, and is in relation with the stomach, the first portion of the duodenum, and the commencement of the transverse arch of the colon. The posterior surface is grooved for the splenic vein, and tunnelled by a complete canal for the superior mesenteric and portal vein, and superior mesenteric artery. The upper border presents a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the splenic arterj"^ and vein, and isTHE SPLEEN. 595 ill relation with the oblique portion of the duodenum, the lobus Spi- gelii, and coeliac axis. And the lower border is separated from the tnmsverse portion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Upon the posterior part of the head of the pancreas is a lobular fold of the gland which completes the canal of the superior mesenteric vessels, and is called the lesser pancreas. In structure, the pancreas is composed of reddish-yellow polyhedral lobules; these consist of smaller lobules, and the latter are made up of the arborescent ramifications of minute ducts, terminating in caecal pouches. The pancreatic duct commences at the papilla on the inner and pos- terior surface of the perpendicular portion of the duodenum by a small dilatation which is common to it and the ductus communis choledo- chus, and, passing obliquely between the mucous and muscular coats, runs from right to left through the middle of the gland, lying nearer its anterior than its posterior smface. At about the commencement of the apicial third of its course it divides into two parallel terminal branches. The duct gives oft’ numerous small branches, which are distributed through the lobules, and constitute, with the latter, the substance of the gland. The duct which receives the secretion from the lesser pancreas is called the ductus pancreaticus minor ; it opens into the principal duct near the duodenum, and sometimes passes sepa- rately into that intestine. As a variety, two pancreatic ducts are occasionally met with. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the pancreas are branches of the splenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric ; the veins open into the splenic vein ; the lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are filaments of the splenic plexus. THE SPLEEN. The spleen is an oblong flattened organ, of a dark bluish-red colour, situated in the left hypochondriac region. It is variable in size and weight, spongy and vascular in texture, and exceedingly friable. The external surface is convex, the internal slightly concave, indent- ed along the middle line, and pierced by several large and iiregular openings for the entrance and exit of vessels ; this is the Mlus lienis. The upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower, and rounded; the inferior is flattened ; the posterior border is obtuse, the anterior is sharp, and marked by several notches. The spleen is in relation by its external or convex surface with the diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs ; by its concave surface, with the great end of the stomach, the extremity of the pancreas, the gastro-splenic omentum and its vessels, the left kidney and supra- renal capsule, and the left crus of the diaphragm ; by its upper end with the diaphragm, and sometimes with the extremity of the left lobe of the liver; and, by its lower end, with the left extremity of the trans-596 THE HUPRA-RENAL CAPfiUTES. verse arch of the colon. It is connected to the stomach by the gastro- splenic omentum, and by the vessels contained in that duplicature. A second spleen (lien succenturiatus) is sometimes found appended to one of the branches of the splenic artery, near the great end of the stomach; when it exists, it is round and of small size, rarely larger than a hazel-nut. I have seen two, and even three, of these bodies. The spleen is invested by the peritoneum and by a tunica propria of yellow elastic tissue, which enables it to yield to the greater or less distension of its vessels. The elastic tunic forms sheaths for the vessels in their ramifications through the organ, and from these sheaths small fibrous bands are given oflf in all directions, which become attached to the in- ternal surface of the elastic tunic, and constitute the areolar framework of the spleen. The substance occupying the interspaces of this tissue is soft, granular, and of a bright red colour; and frequently interspersed with small, white, soft corpuscles (Malpighian bodies). These cor- puscles, according to the researches of Oesterlen and Mr. Simon, are aggregations of cyto-blasts enclosed in a kind of capsule of capillar}’ vessels. There are, besides, separate cyto-blasts scattered through the red substance. Vessels and Nerves.—The Splenic artery is of very large size in pro- portion to the bulk of the spleen ; it is a division of the ccfiliac axis. The branches which enter the spleen are distributed to distinct sections of the organ, and anastomose very sparingly with each other. The veins by their numerous dilatations constitute the principal part of the bulk of the spleen ; they pour their blood into the splenic vein, which is one of the two great formative tmnks of the portal vein. The lym- phatics are remarkable for their number and large size; they terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are, the splenic plexus, derived from the solar plexus. THE SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The supra-renal capsules are two small yellowish and flattened bodies surmounting the kidneys, and inclining inwards towards the vertebral column. The right is somewhat three-cornered in shape, the left semilunar; they are connected to the kidneys by the common investing areolar tissue, and each capsule is marked on its anterior surface by a fissure which appears to divide it into two lobes. The right supra-renal capsule is closely adherent to the posterior and under surface of the liver, and the left lies in contact with the pancreas. Both capsules rest against the crura of the diaphragm on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, and, by their inner border, are in relation with the great splanchnic nerve and semilunar ganglion. They are larger in the foetus than in the adult, and appear to perform some office connected with embryonic life. The anatomy of these organs in the foetus will be found in the succeeding chapter. In structure they are composed of two substances, cortical and medullary. The cortical substance is of a yellowish colour, and con-THE KIDNEYS. 597 sists of straight parallel columns placed perpendicularly side by side. The medullary substance is generally of a dark brown colour, double the quantity of the yellow substance, soft and spongy in texture, and contains within its centre the trunk of a large vein, the vena supra- renalis. It is the large size of this vein that gives to the fresh supra- renal capsule the appearance of a central cavity : the dark-coloured pulpy or fluid contents of the capsule, at a certain period after death, are produced by softening of the medullary substance. Dr. Nagel* has shown, by his injections and microscopic examinations, that the appearance of columns in the cortical substance is caused by the direction of a plexus of capillary vessels. Of the numerous minute arteries, supplying the supra-renal capsule, he says, the greater num- ber enter the cortical substance at every point of its surface, and, after proceeding for scarcely half a line, divide into a plexus of straight capillar}' vessels. Some few of the small arteries traverse the cortical layer, and give off, in the medullary substance, several branches which proceed in different directions, and re-enter the cortical layer to divide into a capillary plexus in a similar manner with the first described. From the capillary plexus, composing the cortical layer, the blood is received by numerous small veins which form a venous plexus in the medullary substance, and terminate at acute angles in the large central vein. According to the more recent researches of Oesterlen and Mr. Simon, the appearance of columns is due to groups of small corpuscles or cyto- blasts associated with elementary granules and fat-cells collected toge- ther in the form of parallel cylinders or cones, each group being en- closed in a tube of delicate membrane (limitary membrane). The medullary substance and intercolumnar spaces contain cyto-blasts uni- formly scattered and interspersed with granules and fat-cells. Oester- len found also,|occasionaUy, in the medullary substance elongated spaces, without lining membrane, containing a thick greyish-white fluid. Vessels and Nerves.—The supra-renal arteries are derived from the aorta, from the renal, and from the phrenic arteries; they are remark- able for the innumerable minute twigs into which they divide pre- viously to entering the capsule. The supra-renal vein collecting the blood from the medullary venous plexus, and receiving several branches which pierce the cortical layer, opens directly into the vena cava on the right side, and into the renal vein on the left. The Lymphatics are large and very numerous; they terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the renal and from the phrenic plexus. THE KIDNEYS. The kidneys, the secreting organs of the urine, are situated in the lumbar regions, behind the peritoneum, and on each side of the ver- * Muller’s Archiv. 1836.598 STRUCTURE OE TJIE KIDNEYS. tebral column, which hitter they approach by their upper extremities. • Each kidney is between four and five inches in length, about two inches and a half in breadth, somewhat more than one inch in thick- ness, and weighs between three and five ounces. The kidneys are usually enclosed in a quantity of fat; they rest on the diaphragm, on the anterior lamella of the transversalis muscle, which separates them from the quadratus lumborum, and on the psoas magnus. The ri(jhi kidney is somewhat lower than the left, from the position of the liver; it is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the liver and descending portion of the duodenum, which rest against it ; and is covered in by the ascending colon and by its flexure. The left kidney, higher than the right, is covered, in front, by the great end of the stomach, by the spleen, descending colon with its flexure, and by a portion of the small intestines. The anterior surface of the kidney is convex, while the posterior is flat ; the superior extremity is in relation with the supra- renal capsule ; the convex border is turned outwards towards the parietes of the abdomen ; the con- cave border looks inwards towards the vertebral column, and is exca- vated by a deep fissure, the hilus renalis, in which are situated the vessels and nerves and pelvis of the kidney; the renal vein being the most anterior, next the renal artery, and lastly the pelvis. The kidney is dense and fragile in texture, and is invested by a pro- per fibrous capsule, which is easily tom from its surface. When di- vided by a longitudinal incision, carried from the convex to the con- cave border, it is found to present in its interior two structures, an exter- nal or vascular (cortical), and an in- ternal or tubular (medullary) sub- stance. The tubular portion is form- ed of pale reddish-coloured conical masses, corresponding by their bases with the vascular structure, and by their apices with the hilus of the organ; these bodies are named cones (pyramids of Malpighi), and are from eight to fifteen in number. The vascular portion is composed * A section of the kidney, surmounted by the supra-renal capsule; the swell- ings on the surface mark the original constitution of the organ of distinct lobes. 1.

The cones or pyramids of the tubular portion of the kidney are com- posed of minute straight tubuli uriniferi, of about the diameter of a fine hair. The tubuli commence at the apices of the cones, and pursue a parallel course towards the periphery of the organ, bifurcating from point to point, and separated only by minute straight blood-vessels, and a small quantity of parenchymatous substance. At the bases of the p^Tamids the tubuli collect into smaller conical fasciculi, which are prolonged into the substance of the cortical portion of the kidney, and have interposed between them processes of the vascular structure. In the smaller pyramids the fasciculi separate into their component tubules, which, after a course marked by “ tortuosities, plexuses, convolutions, and dilatations,” terminate, according to Mr. Bowman,* in small round bodies, the corpora JNIalpighiana, or, according to Krause and the recent investigations of Mr. To3'nbee,t by anastomoses and csecal ex- tremities. The average diameter of the tubuli uriniferi in the cortical portion of the kidney is the -g-i-p of an inch, of which about two-thirds are occupied by a nucleated epithelium, the remaining third represent- ing the area of the tube. According to Mr. Bowman, the epithelium is ciliated in that part of the tubule which is near the Malpighian body, and which, according to the same authority, is very much con- stricted. In the cortical portion of the kidney are contained a multitude of minute, red, globular bodies, the corpora Malpighiana, or glomeruli. Each iMalpighian body, about of an inch in diameter, is composed of a plexus of capillary vessels, and, in addition, according to Mr. Tojmbee, of a coil of an uriniferous tubule j the tuft of capillaries and the coil of the tubule being both enclosed in a thin, membranous cap- side. According to Mr. Bowman, the capsule of the Malpighian bodj' is the origin of the uriniferous tubule expanded into a globular form for the reception of the capillary tuft. The capillary vessels of the vascular tuft are arranged in loops closely packed together, and sur- roimded by an epithelium which is continuous with a similar struc- ture lining the inner surface of the capsule. They are derived from a small arterj', which, after piercing the capsule, immediately divides in a radiated manner into several branches. From the interior of this little vascular ball a vein proceeds, smaller than the corresponding arterj', and pierces the capsule close by the arterv, to comniunicate with the efferent vessels of other Malpighian bodies and constitute a venous plexus. The cones or mamillary processes of the interior of the kidney are invested by mucous membrane, which is continuous at their apices * On the Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the Kidney.

The calices communi- cate with a common cavity of larger size, situated at each extremity, and in the middle of the organ ; and these three cavities, the infun- dibula, constitute by their union the large membranous sac, which occupies the hilus renalis, the pelvis of the kidney. The kidney in the embryo and foetus consists of lobules. See the anatomy of the foetus in the succeeding Chapter. The Ureter, (ou^av, urine, rv^uv, to keep,) the excretory duct of the kidnej", is a membranous tube of about the diameter of a goose-quill, and nearly eighteen inches in length ; it is continuous superiorly with the pelvis of the kidney, and is constricted inferiorly, where it lies in an oblique direction between the muscular and mucous coats of the base of the bladder, ami opens upon its mucous surface. Lying along the posterior wall of the abdomen, it is situated behind the peritoneum, and is crossed by the spermatic vessels; in its course downwards it rests against the anterior surface of the psoas, and crosses the common iliac artery and vein, and then the external iliac vessels. Within the pelvis it crosses the umbilical artery and the vas deferens in the male, and the upper part of the vagina in the female. There are sometimes two ureters to one kidney. The ureter, the pelvis, the infundibula, and the calices are composed of two coats, an external or fibrous coat, the tunica propria; and an internal mucous coat, which is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder inferiorly, and with that of the tubuli uriniferi above. Vessels and Nerves,—The renal artery is derived from the aorta; it divides into several large branches before entering the hilus, and with- in the organ ramifies in an arbores- cent manner, terminating in nutrient twigs, and in the small inferent ves- sels of the corpora Malpighiana. In the Malpighian bodies the infe- rent vessels divide into several pri- mary twigs, which subdivide into capillaries, and the capillaries, after forming loops, converge to the efferent vein, which is generally smaller than the corresponding arter3^ The efferent veins proceed to and • Plan of the renal circulation ; copied from Mr. Bowman’s paper, a.

GO I form a capillary venous plexus, which surrounds the tortuous tubuli uriniferi, and from this venous plexus the blood is conveyed, by con- verging branches, into the renal vein. “ Thus,” remarks Mr. Bowman, “ there are in the kidney two •perfectly distinct systems of capillary vessels, through both of which the blood passes in its course from the arteries into the veins; the first, that” which forms the vascular tuft in the Malpighian bodies, and is “ in immediate connection with the arteries ; the second, that enveloping the convolutions of the tubes and communicating directly with the veins. The efferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies, that carry the blood between these two systems, may collectively be termed the portal system of the kidney.” The inferences drawn by Mr. Bow- man from his investigtitions are interesting; they are, that the capil- lary tufts of the Malpighian bodies are the part of the kidney specially acted on by diuretics; that they are the medium by which water, cer- tain salts, and other substances, pass out of the system ; that they are, moreover, the means of escape of certain morbid products, such as sugar, albumen, and the red particles of the blood. Respecting the capillary venous plexus, we have proof that the principal proximate constituents of urine, such as urea, lithic acid, &c., are, like the bile, derived from venous (portal) blood. The Veins of the kidney commence at the surface by minute con- verging venules, the stellated vessels, and proceed inwards, receiving in their course the veins of the cortical and tubular portions of the organ. On arriving at the pelvis, they unite to form the branches of the renal vein, which terminates in the vena cava by a single large trunk on each side; the left renal vein receiving the left spermatic vein. Injec- tions thrown into the renal artery, and returning by the tubuli muni- feri, make their way into those tubes by rupture. The lymphatic ves- sels terminate in the lumbar glands. The Nerves are derived from the renal plexus, which is formed partly by the solar plexus, and partly by the lesser splanchnic nerve. The renal plexus gives branches to the spermatic plexus, and branches which accompany the ureters: hence the morbid sympathies which exist between the kidney, the ureter, and the testicle: and by the communications with the solar plexus, with the stomach and dia- phragm, and indeed with the whole system. In the intimate structure of the kidney, the nerve-fibres are, according to Mr. Toynbee, conti- nuous with the nucleated cells of the parenchyma of the organ.G02 PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is that portion of the great abdominal cavity which is included within the bones of the pelvis, below the level of the linea-ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. It is bounded by the cavity of the abdomen above, and by the perineum below; its internal parietes are formed, in front, below, and at the sides, by the peritoneum, pelvic fascia, levatores ani muscles, obturator fasciae, and muscles; and behind, by the sacrum and sacral plexus of nerves. The Viscera of the pelvis in the male are, the urinary bladder, the prostate gland, vesiculae seminales, and the rectum. BLADDER. The Bladder is an oblong membranous viscus of an ovoid shape, situated behind the ossa pubis and in front of the rectum. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side ; and its long axis is directed from above, obliquely downwards and backwards. It is divided into, body, fundus, base, and neck. The body comprehends the middle zone of the organ ; the fundus, its upper segment; the base, the lower broad extremity which rests on the rectum ; and the neek, the narrow constricted portion which is applied against the pros- tate gland. This organ is retained in its place by ligaments, Avhich are divided into true and false : the true ligaments are seven in number, two an- terior, two lateral, two umbilical, and the urachus; the false ligaments are folds of the peritoneum, and are four in number, two anterior and two posterior. The anterior ligaments are formed by the pelvic fascia, which passes from the inner surface of the os pubis, on each side of the symphysis, to the front of the bladder. The lateral ligaments are formed by the reflexion of the pelvic fascia from the levatores ani muscles, upon the sides of the base of the bladder. The umbilical ligaments are the fibrous cords which result from the obliteration of the umbilical arteries of the foetus; they pass forwards on each side of the fundus of the bladder, and ascend beneath the peritoneum to the umbi- licus. The urachus is a small fibrous cord formed by the obliteration of a tubular canal existing in the embryo : it is attached to the apex of the bladder, and thence ascends to the umbilicus. The fahe ligaments are folds of peritoneum; the two lateral correspond vdth the passage of the vasa deferentia from the sides of the bladder to the internal abdo- minal rings, and the two posterior with the course of the umbilical arteries, to the fundus of the organ. The bladder is composed of three coats, an external or serous coat, a muscular, and a mucous coat. The serous coat is partial, and derived from the peritoneum, which invests the posterior surface and sides of the bladder, from about opposite the point of termination of the two ureters to its summit, whence it is guided to the anterior wall of the603 URINARY BLADDER. abdomen by the umbilical ligaments and urachus. The miiscular coat j consists of two layers, an external layer composed of longitudinal | tibres, the detrusor urime ; and an internal layer of oblique and trans- | verse fibres irregularly distributed. The anterior longitudinal fibres I commence by four tendons (the tendons of the bladder or of the de- trusor urime), two superior from the ossa pubis, and two inferior from the rami of the ischia, and spread out as they ascend upon the anterior surface of the bladder to its fundus; they then converge upon the pos- terior surface of the organ, and descend to its neck, where they are • A side view of the viscera of the male pelvis, in situ.

Some of the anterior fibres are also attached j to this ring. The lateral fibres commence at the prostate gland and the muscular ring of the urethra on one side, and spread out as they | ascend upon the side of the bladder to descend upon the opposite side, I and be inserted into the prosfcite and opposite segment of the same ring. Two bands of oblique fibres are described by Sir Charles Bell, as originating at the terminations of the ureters, and converging to the neck of the bladder; the existence of these muscles is not well established. The fibres corresponding with the trigonum vesicaj are transverse. It has been shown by Mr. Guthrie,* that there are no fibres at the neck of the bladder capable of forming a sphincter vesicae ; but Mr. Lane f has described a fasciculus of muscular fibres which surround the commencement of the urethra, and perform such an office. These fibres form a narrow bundle above the urethra, but spread out below behind the prostate gland ; they are brought into view by dissecting off the mucous membrane from around the orifice of the urethra. Sir Astley Cooper has described around the urethra, within the prostate gland, a ring of elastic tissue, or, rather, according to Mr. Lane, of muscular fibres, which has for its object the closure of the urethra against the involuntary passage of the urine. It is into this ring that the longitudinal fibres of the detrusor urinse are inserted, so that the muscle, taking a fixed point at the os pubis, will not only com- press the bladder, and thereby tend to force its contents along the urethra, but will at the same time, by means of its attachment to the ring, dilate the entrance of the urethra, and afford a free egress to the contents of the bladder. The Mucous coat is thin and smooth, and exactly moulded upon the muscular coat, to which it is connected by a somewhat thick layer of submucous tissue, called by some anatomists the nervous coat ; its papillae are very minute, and there is scarcely a trace of mucous follicles. This mucous membrane is continuous, through the ureters, with the lining membrane of the uriniferous ducts, and, through the urethra, with that of the prostatic ducts, tubuli seminiferi, and Cow- per’s glands. Upon the internal surface of the base of the bladder is a triangular smooth plane of a paler colour than the rest of the mucous membrane, the trigonum vesicae, or trigone vesicate, (fig. 191.) This is the most sensitive part of the bladder, and the pressure of calculi upon it gives rise to great suffering. It is bounded on each side by the raised ridge, corresponding with the muscles of the ureters, at each posterior angle by the openings of the ureters, and, in front, bj’ a slight eleva- tion of the mucous membrane at the entrance of the urethra, called uvula vesiccB. * “ On the Anatomy and Diseases of the Neck of the Bladder and of the Urethra.” ' f Lancet, vol. i. 1842-43, p. 670.60.5 PROSTATE GLAND. Tlie external surface of the base of the bladder corresponding with :the trigonum, is also triangular, and is separated from the rectum :.merely by a thin layer of fibrous membrane, the recto-vesical fascia. ; It is bounded behind by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum ; and on each side by the vas deferens and vesicula seminalis, which converge ..almost to a point at the base of the prostate gland. It is through : this space that the opening is made in the recto-vesical operation for puncture of the bladder. PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland praeponere) is situated, in front of the 1 neck of the bladder, behind thie deep perineal fascia, and upon the rec- ■ turn, through which latter it may be felt with the finger. It surrounds ; the commencement of the urethra for a little more than an inch of its . extent, and resembles a Spanish chestnut both in size and form ; the ■ base being directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder, the •lapex forwards, and the convex side towards the rectum. It is re- :tained firmly in its position by the two superior and two inferior : tendons of the bladder, by the attachments of the pelvic fascia, and by . a process of the internal layer of the deep perineal fascia, which forms ja sheath around the membranous urethra, and is inserted into the 5 apex of the gland. It consists of three lobes, two lateral and a middle 1 lobe or isthmus; the lateral lobes are distinguished by an indentation : upon the base of the gland, and by a slight furrow upon its upper and 1 lower surface. The third lobe or isthmus is a small transverse band > which passes between the two lateral lobes at the base of the organ, i In structure the prostate gland is composed of ramified ducts, termi- I nating in lobules of follicular pouches, which are so closely compressed 3 as to give to a thin section of the gland a cellular appearance. It is : pale in colour and hard in texture, splits easily in the course of its ’ ducts, and is surrounded by a plexus of veins which are enclosed by : the strong fibrous membrane with which it is invested. Its secretion I is poured into the prostatic portion of the urethra by fifteen or twenty I excretory ducts. The urethra in passing through the prostate lies ( one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface. VESICUL.® SEMINALES. On the under surface of the base of the bladder, and converging to- ’ wards the base of the prostate gland, are two lobulated and somewhat j pyriform bodies, about two inches in length, the vesiculae seminales. Their upper surface is in contact with the base of the bladder ; the I imder side rests on the rectum, separated only by the recto-vesical I fescia ; the larger extremities are directed backwards and outwards, I and the smaller ends almost meet at the base of the prostate. They t enclose between them a triangular space, which is bounded posteriorlyGOG MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, and which corresponds witli the trigonum vesicae on the interior of the bladder. Each vesicula is formed by the convolutions of a single tube, which gives off several irregular caecal branches. It is enclosed in a dense fibrous membrane, derived from the pelvic fascia, and Fig. 189.* is constricted beneath the isthmus of the prostate gland into a small excretory duct. The vas deferens, somewhat enlarged and convoluted, lies along the inner border of each vesicula, and is included in its fi- brous investment. It communicates with the duct of the vesicula, be- neath the isthmus of the prostate, and forms’h the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct is about three quarters of an inch in length, and running forwards, first between the base of the prostate and the isth- mus, and then through the tissue of the veru montanum, opens upon the mucous membrane of the urethra, near its fellow of the opposite side, at the anterior extremity of that process. MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The organs of generation in the male are, the penis and the testes, with their appendages. PENIS. The Penis is divisible into a body, root, and extremity. The body is surrounded by a thin integument, wliich is remarkable for the * The posterior aspect of the male bladder; the serous covering is removed in order to shew the muscular coat. 1.

The triangular area, bounded by the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales on either side, a dotted line above, and the numeral 3 below, is the space corresponding with the trigonum vesicae. It is this part of the bladder which is pierced, in puncturing the bladder through the rectum. The dotted line, forming the base of this triangular area, marks the extent of the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum. t It has been customaiy hitherto, in works on anatomy, to describe the course of excretory ducts as proceeding from the gland, and.passing thence to the point at which the secretion is poured out. In the description of the vas deferens, with its connexion with the duct of the vesicula seminalis, I have adopted this plan, that I might not too far depart from established habit. But as it is more correct and consistent with the present state of science to consider the gland as a development of the duct, I have pursued the latter principle in the description of most of the other glandular organs of the body.607 CORPUS CAVERNOSUM. looseness of its areolar connexion with the deeper parts of the organ, and for containing no adipose tissue. The root is broad, and firmly adherent to the rami of the ossa pubis and ischia by means of two strong processes, the crura, and is connected to the symphysis pubis by a fibrous membrane, the ligamentum suspensorium. The extremity^ or glatis penis, resembles an obtuse cone, somewhat compressed from above downwards, and of a deeper red colour than the surrounding skin. At its apex is a small vertical slit, the meatus urinarius, which is bounded by two, more or less protuberant, labia ; and, extending backwards from the meatus, is a depressed raphd, to which is at- tached a loose fold of mucous membrane, the frrnnum prmputii. The base of the glans is marked by a projecting collar, the corona glandis, upon which are seen a number of small papillary elevations, the glanduhe Tysoni (odoriferse). Behind the corona is a deep fossa, bounded by a circular fold of integument, the prceputium, which, in the quiescent state of the organ, may be drawn over the glans, but, in its distended state, is obliterated, and serves to facilitate its enlarge- ment. The internal surface of the prepuce is lined by mucous mem- brane, covered by a thin epithelium ; this membrane, on reaching the base of the glans, is reflected over the glans penis, and, at the meatus urinarius, is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. The penis is composed of the corpus cavernosum and corpus spon- giosum, and contains in its interior the longest portion of the urethra. The Corpus cavernosum is distinguished into two lateral portions (corpora cavernosa) by an imperfect septum and by a superior and inferior groove, and is divided posteriorly into two crura. It is firmly adlierent, by means of its crura, to the rami of the ossa pubis and ischia. It forms, anteriorly, a single rounded extremity, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans penis ; the superior groove lodges the dorsal vessels of the organ, and the inferior receives the corpus spongiosum. Its fibrous tunic is thick, elastic, and ex- tremely firm, and sends a number of fibrous bands and cords (tra- beculae) inwards from its inferior groove, which cross its interior in a radiating direction, and are inserted into the inner walls of the tunic. These trabeculae are most abundant on the middle line, where they are ranged vertically, side by side, somewhat like the teeth of a comb, and constitute the imperfect partition of the corpus cavernosum, called septum pectiniforme- This septum is more complete at its posterior than towards its anterior part. The tunic of the corpus cavernosum consists of strong longitudinal fibrous fasciculi, closely interwoven with each other. Its internal structure is composed of erectile tissue. The Corpus spongiosum is situated along the under surface of the corpus cavernosum, in its inferior groove. It commences by its pos- terior extremity between and beneath the crura penis, where it forms a considerable enlargement, the bidb, and terminates anteriorly by another expansion, the glans penis. Its middle portion, or body, is nearly cylindrical, and tapers gradually from its posterior towards itsERECTILE TISSUE. —URETHRA. (i08 anterior extremity. The bulb is adherent to the deep perineal fascia by means of the tubular prolongation of the anterior layer, which sur- rounds the membranous portion of the urethra ; in the rest of its extent the corpus spongiosum is attached to the corpus cavemosum by areolar tissue, and by veins which wind around that body to reach the dorsal vein. It is composed of erectile tissue, enclosed by a dense fibrous layer, much thinner than that of the corpus cavemosum, and contains in its interior the spongy portion of the urethra, which lies nearer its upper than its lower wall. Erectile tissue is a peculiar cellule-vascular stracture, entering in considerable proportion into the composition of the organs of genera- tion. It consists essentially of a plexus of veins so closely convoluted and interwoven with each other, as to give rise to a cellular appear- ance when examined by means of a section. The veins forming this plexus are smaller in the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and circum- ference of the corpus cavemosum, than in the central part of the latter, where they are large and dilated. They have no other coat than the internal lining prolonged from the neighbouring veins ; and the inter- stices of the plexus are occupied by a peculiar reddish fibrous tissue. They receive their blood from the capillaries of the arteries in the same manner with veins generally, and not by means of vessels having a peculiar form and distribution, as described by Miiller. The helicine arteries of that physiologist have no existence. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the penis are derived from the internal pudic ; they are, the arteries of the bulb, arteries of the corpus cavemosum, and dorsales penis. Its veins are superficial and deep. The deep veins run by the side of the deep arteries, and ter- minate in the internal pudic veins. The superficial veins escape in considerable number from the base of the glans, and converge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which receives other veins from the corpus cavemosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the ligamentum suspensorium, and through the deep fascia beneath the arch of the os pubis, to terminate in the prostatic and vesical plexuses. The Lymphatics terminate in the inguinal glands. The nerves are derived from the internal pudic nerve, from the sacral plexus, and, as shewn by Professor Muller, in his beautiful monograph, from the hypogastric plexus. URETHRA. The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It is curved in its course, and is composed of two layers, a mucous coat and an elastic fibrous coat. The mucous coat is thin and smooth ; it is continuous, internally, with the mucous membrane of the bladder; externally, with the in- vesting membrane of the glans; and at certain points of its extent, with the lining membrane of the numerous ducts which open into theURETHRA. 609 urethra, namely, those of Co\vper’s glands, the prostate gland, vasa deferentia, and vesicuhe seminales. The elastic fibrous coat varies in thickness in the different parts of the course of the urethra: it is thick in the prostate gland, forms a firm investment for the membranous portion of the canal, and is thin in the spongy portion, where it serves Fig. 190.* • A longitudinal section of the bladder, prostate gland, and penis, shewing the urethra. 1.

The urethra is about nine inches in length, and is di- vided into a prostatic, membranous, and spongy portion. i The Prostatic portion^ a little more than an inch in length, is I situated in the prostate gland, about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface, and extending from its base to its apex. Upon its lower circumference or floor is a longitudinal fold of mucous membrane, the vei'ic montanum, or caput gallinaginis, and on each side of the veru, a depressed fossa, the prostatic sinus, in which are seen the numerous openings of the prostatic ducts. At the anterior extremity of the veru montanum are the openings of the two ejaculatory ducts, and between them a third opening, which leads Fi(/. 191.* backwards into a small caecal sac, the sinus pocularis. The prostatic portion of the urethra, when dis- tended, is the most dilated part of the canal; but, excepting during the passage of urine, is completely closed by means of a ring of muscular tissue which encircles the urethra as far as the anterior extremity of the veru montanum. In the con- tracted state of the urethra, the veru montanum acts as a valve, being pressed upwards against the upper wall of the canal; but, during the action of the detrusor muscle of the bladder, the whole ring is ex- panded by the longitudinal muscular fibres which are inserted into it; and the veru is especially drarni downwards by two delicate ten- j dons, which have been traced by Mr. TjTrell from the posterior fibres of the detrusor into the tissue of this process.

It is situated between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia, and is surrounded by the fan-like expan- sions of the upper and lower segments of the compressor urethrae mus- cle, which meet at the rapM along its upper and lower surface. It is continuous posteriorly with the prostatic urethra, and anteriorly with the spongj- portion of the canal. Its coverings are, the mucous mem- brane, elastic fibrous layer, compressor urethrae muscle, and a partial sheath from the deep perineal fascia. The Spongy portion forms the rest of the extent of the canal, and is lodged in the corpus spongiosum from its commencement at the deep perineal fascia to the meatus urinarius. It is narrowest in the body, and becomes dilated at either extremity, posteriorly in the bulb, where it is named the bulbous portion, and anteriorly in the glans penis, where it forms the fossa naviculads. The meatus urinarius is the most constricted part of the canal; so that a catheter, which will enter that opening, may be passed freely through the whole extent of a normal urethra. Opening into the bulbous portion are two small ex- cretorj' ducts about three-quarters of an inch in length, Avhich may be traced backwards, between the coats of the urethra and the bulb, to the interval between the two laj^ers of the deep perineal fascia, Avhere they ramify in two small lobulated and somewhat compressed glands, of about the size of peas. These are Cowper’s glands; they are situated immediately beneath the membranous portion of the urethra, and are enclosed by the lower segment of the compressor urethrse muscle, so as to be subject to muscular compression. Upon the whole of the internal surface of the spongy portion of the mrethra, particularly along its upper Avail, are munerous small openings or lacunae, Avhich are the apertures of mucous glands situated in the submucous areolar tissue. The openings of these lacunae are directed forwards, and are liable occasionally to intercept the point of a small catheter in its passage into the bladder. At about an inch and a half from the open- ing of the meatus, one of these lacunae is generally found much larger than the rest, and is named the lacuna magna. In a preparation of this lacuna, made by Sir Astley Cooper, the extremity of the canal presents several large primarj^ ramifications. TESTES. The testes are two small glandular organs suspended from the abdo- men by the spermatic cords, and enclosed in an external tegumentary covering, the scrotum. The Scrotum is distinguished into tAvo lateral halves or hemispheres by a raph6, Avhich is continued anteriorly along the under surface of the penis, and posteriorly along the middle line of the perineum to the anus. Of these tAvo lateral portions the left is somewhat longer than the right, and corresponds with the greater length of the sper- matic cord on the left side.612 SCROTUM.—SPERMATIC CORD. The scrotum is composed of two layers, the integument and a proper - covering, the dartos ; the integument is extremely thin, transparent, and abundant, and beset by a number of hairs which issue obliquely from the skin, and have prominent roots. The dartos is a thin layer of contractile fibrous tissue, intermediate in properties between muscu- lar fibre and elastic tissue ; it forms the proper tunic of the scrotum, and sends inwards a distinct septum (septum scroti), which divides it into two cavities for the two testes. The dartos is continuous around the base of the scrotum with the common superficial fascia of the ab- domen and perineum. The Spermatic cord is the medium of communication between the testes and the interior of the abdomen ; it is composed of arteries, veins, lymphatics, nerves, the excretory duct of the testicle, and invest- ing tunics. It commences at the internal abdominal ring, where the vessels of which it is composed converge, and passes obliquely along the spermatic canal; the cord then escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends through the scrotum to the posterior border of the testicle. The left cord is somewhat longer than the right, and per- mits the left testicle to reach a lower level than its fellow. The A rteries of the spermatic cord are, the spermatic artery from the aorta; the deferential artery, accompanying the vas deferens, from the superior vesical; and the cremasteric branch from the epigastric artery. The spermatic veins form a plexus, which constitutes the chief bulk of the cord; they are provided with valves at short intervals, and the smaller veins have a peculiar tendril-like arrangement which has ob- tained for them the name of vasa pampiniformia. The lympluxtics are of large size, and terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus, which is derived from the aortic and renal plexus, the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the scrotal branch of the ilio-scrotal. The Vas deferens, the excretory duct of the testicle, is situated along the posterior border of the cord, where it may easily be distinguished by the hard and cordy sensation which it communicates to the fingers. Its parietes are very thick and tough, and its canal extremely small, and lined by the mucous membrane continued from the urethra. The Coverings of tlie spermatic cord are, the spermatic fascia, cre- master muscle, and fascia propria. The spermatic fascia is a prolonga- tion of the intercolumnar fascia, derived from the borders of the exter- nal abdominal ring during the descent of the testicle in the foetus. The cremasteric covering (erythroid) is the thin muscular expansion formed by the spreading out of the fibres of the cremaster, which is likewise carried down by the testis during its descent. The fascia propria is a continuation of the infundibiliform process from the trans- versalis fascia, which immediately invests the vessels of the cord, and is also obtained during the descent of the testis.613 TESTIS. EPIDIDYMIS. TESTES. The Testis (testicle) is a small obloDg and rounded gland, some- what compressed upon the sides and behind, and suspended in the cavity of the scrotum by the spermatic cord. Its position in the scrotum is oblique ; so that the upper extremity is directed upwards and forwards, and a little outwards ; the lower, downwards and backwards, and a little inwards ; the convex border looks forwards and downwards, and the flattened border, to which the cord is attached, backwards and upwards. Lying against its outer and posterior border is a flattened body which follows the course of the •testicle, and extends from its upper to its lower extremity ; this body is named, from its relation to the testis, epididymis Q.7ri, upon, Vt’ivy.os, the testicle); it is divided into a central part or bod}^, an upper extre- mity or globus major, and a lower extremity, globus minor (cauda) epi- didjTnis. The globus major is situ- ated against the upper end of the testicle, to which it is closely adhe- rent ; the globus minor is placed at its lower end, is attached to the testis by areolar tissue, and curves upwards, to become continuous with the vas deferens. The testis is in- vested by three tunics, tunica vagi- nalis, timica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa, and is connected to the inner surface of the dartos by a large quantitj* of extremely loose areolar tissue, in which fat is never deposited, but which is very sus- ceptible of serous infiltration. The Tunica vaginalis is a pouch of serous membrane derived from the peritoneum in the descent of the testis, and afterwards obliterated from the abdomen to within a short distance of the gland.

G14 serous coverings, it is a shut sac, investing the organ, and thence reflected so as to fomi a bag around its circumference: hence it is divided, into the tunica vaginalis projyria, and tunica vaginalis rejkxa. The tunica vaginalis propria covers the surface of the tunica albuginea, and surrounds the epididymis, connecting it to the testis by means of a distinct duplicature. The tunica vaginalis reflexa is attached by its external surface, through the medium of a quantity of loose areolar tissue, to the inner surface of the dartos. Between the two layers is the smooth surface of the shut sac, moistened by its proper secre- tion. The Tunica albuginea (dura mater testis) is a thick fibrous mem- brane, of a bluish white colour, and the proper tunic of the testicle. It is adherent externally to the tunica vaginalis propria, and from the union of a serous with a fibrous membrane is considered to be a fibro- serous membrane, like the dura mater and pericardium. After sur- rounding the testicle, the tunica albuginea is reflected from its posterior border into the interior of the gland, and forms a projecting longitudinal ridge, which is called the mediastinum testis (corpus Highmorianum*), from which numerous fibrous cords (trabecidae, septula) are given off, to be inserted into the inner surface of the tunic. The mediastinum serves to contain the vessels and ducts of the testicle in their passage into the substance of the organ, and the fibrous cords are admirably fitted, as has been shewn by Sir Astley Cooper, to prevent compres- sion of the gland. If a transverse section be made of the testis, and the surface of the mediastinum examined, it will be observed that the blood-vessels of the substance of the organ are situated near the poste- rior border of the mediastinum, while the divided ducts of the rete testis occupy a place nearer the free margin. The Tunica vasculosa (pia mater testis) is the nutrient membrane of the testis; it is situated immediately within the tunica albuginea, and encloses the substance of the gland, sending processes inwards between the lobules, in the same manner that the pia mater is reflected between the convolutions of the brain. The substance of the testis consists of numerous conical flattened lobules (lobuli testis), the bases being directed towards the surface of the organ, and the apices towards the mediastinum. Krause found between four and five hundred of these lobules in a single testis. Each lobule is invested by a distinct sheath formed of two layers, one being derived from the tunica vasculosa, the other from the tunica albuginea. The lobule is composed of one or several minute tubuli, tubuli seminiferi,‘Y exceedingly convoluted, anastomosing frequently * Nathaniel Highmore, a physician of Oxford, in his “ Corporis Humani Dis- quisitio Anatomica,” published in 1651, considers the corpus Highmorianum as a duct formed by the convergence of the fibrous cords, which he mistakes for smaller ducts. t Lauth estimates the whole number of tubuli seminiferi in each testis at 840, and their average length at 2 feet 3 inches. According to this calculation, the whole length of the tubuli seminiferi would be 1890 feet.STRUCTURE OF THE EPIDIDYMIS. 615 meter of the tubuli seminiferi, the with each other near their extremities, terminating in loops or in free cmcal ends, and of the same diameter inch, Lauth) through- out. The tubuli seminiferi are of a bright yellow colour ; they become less convoluted in the apices of the lobules, and terminate by forming between twenty and thirty small straight ducts of about t^vice the dia- vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the substance of the mediastinum, and tenuinate in from seven to thirteen ducts, smaller in diameter than the vasa recta. These ducts pursue a waving course from below upwards through the fibrous tissue of the mediastinum ; they communicate freely with each other, and constitute the rete testis. At the upper extre- mity of the mediastinum, the ducts of the rete testis terminate in from nine to thirty small ducts, the vasa effcrentia.,\ which form by their con- volutions a series of conical masses, the coni vascidosi; from the bases of these cones tubes of larger size proceed, which constitute, by their complex convolutions, the body of the epididymis. The tubes become gradually larger towards the lower end of the epididymis, and terminate in a single large and convoluted duct, the vas deferens. The Epididymis is formed by the convolutions of the excretory seminal ducts, externally to the testis, and previously to their termi- nation in the vas deferens. The more numerous convolutions and the aggregation of the coni vasculosi at the upper end of the organ consti- tute the globus major; the continuation of the convolutions downwards is the body; and the smaller number of convolutions of the single tube at the lower extremity, the globus minor. The tubuli are connected together by a very delicate areolar tissue, and are enclosed by the tunica vaginalis. * Anatomy of the testis. 1,1. The tunica albuginea. 2, 2. The mediastinum testis. 3, 3.

A small convoluted duct, of variable length, is generally connected - with the duct of the epididymis immediately before the commence- ment of the vas deferens. This is the vasculum aberrans of Haller; it is attached to the epididymis by the areolar tissue in which that body is enveloped. Sometimes it becomes dilated towards its extremity, but more frequently retains the same diameter throughout. The Fas deferens may be traced upwards in the course of the seminal fluid, from the globus minor of the epididymis along the posterior part of the spermatic cord, and along the spermatic canal to the internal ab- dominal ring. From the ring it is reflected inwards to the side of the fundus of the bladder, and descends along its posterior surface, crossing the direction of the ureter, to the inner border of the vesicula seminalis. In this situation it becomes somewhat larger in size and convoluted, and terminates at the base of the prostate gland, by uniting with the duct of the vesicula seminalis and constituting the ejaculatory' duct. The ejaculatory duct, which is thus formed by the junction of the duct of the vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens, passes forwards to the anterior extremity of the veru montanum, where it terminates by opening into the prostatic urethra. FEMALE PELVIS. The peculiarities in form of the female pelvis have already been examined with the anatomy of the bones (p. 94). Its lining boundaries are the same with those of the male. The contents are, the bladder, vagina, uterus with its appendages, and the rectum. Some portion of the small intestines also occupies the upper part of its cavity. The Bladder is in relation with the ossa pubis in front, with the uterus behind, from which it is usually separated by a convolution of small intestine, and with the neck of the uterus and vagina beneath. The form of the female bladder corresponds with that of the pelvis, being broad from side to side, and often bulging more on one side than on the other. This is particularly evident after fre- quent parturition. The coats of the bladder are the same as those of the male. The Urethra is about an inch and a half in length, and is lodged in the upper wall of the vagina, in its coimse downwards and forwards, beneath the arch of the os pubis^ to the meatus urinarius. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is disposed in longitudinal folds, and is continuous internally with that of the bladder, and externally with that of the vulva ; the mucous membrane is surrounded by a proper coat of elastic tissue, to which the muscular fibres of the detrusor urinae are attached. It is to the elastic tissue that is due the remark- able dilatability of the female urethra, and its speedy return to its original diameter. The meatus is encircled by a ring of fibrous tis-FEMALE PELVIS. 617 sue, which prevents it from distending with the same facility as the rest of the canal ; hence it is sometimes advantageous in performing Fig, 194.* this operation to divide the margin of the meatus slightly with the knife. * A side view of the viscera of the female pelvis. 1.

It is constricted at its commencement, but near the uterus becomes dilated ; and is closed by the contact of the anterior with the posterior wall. Its length is variable ; but it is always longer upon the posterior than upon the anterior wall, the former being usually about five or six inches in length, and the latter four or five. It is attached to the cervix of the uterus, which latter projects into the upper extremity of the canal. In iStructure the vagina is composed of a mucous lining, a layer of erectile tissue, and an external tunic of contractile fibrous tissue, re- sembling the dartos of the scrotum. The upper fourth of the posterior wall of the vagina is covered, on its pelvic surface, by the peritoneum; while in front the peritoneum is reflected from the upper part of the cervix of the uterus to the posterior surface of the bladder. On each side it gives attachment, superiorly, to the broad ligaments of the uterus; and, interiorly, to the pelvic fascia and levatores ani. The Mucous membrane presents a number of transverse papUUe or rugce upon the upper and lower surfaces ojf the canal, the rugae ex- tending outwards on each side from a middle raphe. The transverse papillaj and rapM are more apparent upon the upper than upon the lower surface, and the two raphe are called the columns of the vagina. The mucous membrane is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium, which is continued from the labia, and terminates by a fringed border at about the middle of the cervix uteri. The Middle or erectile layer consists of erectile tissue enclosed be- tween two layers of fibrous membrane ; this layer is thickest near the commencement of the vagina, and becomes gradually thinner as it approaches the uterus. The Eocternal, or dartoid layer of the vagina, serves to connect it to the surrounding viscera. Thus, it is very closely adherent to the under surface of the bladder, and drags that organ down ndth it in prolapsus uteri. To the rectum it is less closely connected, and that intestine is therefore less frequently affected in prolapsus. UTERUS. The Uterus is a flattened organ of a pyriform shape, having the base directed upwards and forwards, and the apex domiwards and back- wards in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pehds, and forming a considerable angle with the course of the vagina. It is convex on its posterior surface, and somewhat flattened upon its anterior aspect. In the unimpregnated state it is about three inches in length, two in619 LIGAMENTS OP THE UTERUS. i breadth across its broadest part, and one in thickness, and is divisible i into fundus, body, cervix, and os uteri. At the period of puberty the 1 uterus weighs about one ounce and a half; after parturition from two ■: to three ounces ; and at the ninth month of utero-gestation from two • to four pounds. Fig. 195.* The Fundus and body are enclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, which is connected with the sides of the pelvis, and forms a transverse I septiun between the bladder and rectum. The folds formed by this i duplicature of peritoneum on either side of the organ are the broad , ligaments of the uterus. The cervix is the lower portion of the organ; i it is distinguished from the body by a well-marked constriction ; a around its circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, and ; at its extremity is an opening which is neairly round in the virgin, and 1 transverse after parturition, the os uteri, bounded before and behind ’ by two labia ; the anterior labium being the most thick, and the pos- I terior somewhat the longest. The opening of the os uteri is of con- I siderable size, and is named the orificium uteri externum ; the canal ■ then becomes narrowed, and at the upper end of the cervix is con- stricted into a smaller opening, the orificium intemum.f At this • The uterus with its appeudages viewed on their anterior aspect. 1.

G20 point the canal of the cervix expands into the shallow triangukr cavity of the uterus, the inferior angle corresponding with the orificium intenium, and the two superior angles, which are funnel-shaped, and represent the original bicomute condition of the organ, with the com- mencement of the Fallopian tubes. In the canal of the cervix uteri are two or three longitudinal folds, to which numerous oblique folds converge so as to give the idea of branches from the stem of a tree ; hence this appearance has been denominated the arbor vitae uterina. Between these folds, and around the os uteri, are numerous mucous follicles. It is the closure of the mouth of one of these follicles, and the subsequent distention of the follicle with its proper secretion, that occasions those vesicular appearances, so often noticed within the mouth and cervix of the uterus, called the ovula of Naboth. Structure.—The uterus is composed of three tunics ; of an external or serous coat, derived from the peritoneum, which constitutes the duplicatures on each side of the organ called the broad ligaments; of a middle or muscular coat, which gives thickness and bulk to the uterus; and of an internal or mucous membrane, which lines its in- terior, and is continuous on the one hand with the mucous lining of the Fallopian tubes, and on the other with that of the vagina. In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly condensed in texture, offers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uteras the fibres are of large size, and distinct, and are disposed in two lajmrs, superficial and deep. The superficial layer consists of fibres which pursue a vertical direc- tion, some being longitudinal, and others oblique. The longitudinal fibres are found principally on the middle line, forming a thin plane upon the anterior and posterior face of the organ and upon its fundus. The oblique fibres occupy chiefly the sides and the fundus. At the angles of the uteras the fibres of the superficial layer are continued outwards upon the Fallopian tubes, and into the round bgaments and ligaments of the ovaries. The deep layer consists of two hollow cones of circular fibres having their apex at the openings of the Fallopian tubes, and intermingling with each other by their bases on the body of the organ. These fibres are continuous with the deep muscular layer of the Fallopian tubes, and indicate the primitive formation of the uterus by the blending of these two canals. Around the cervix uteri the muscular fibres assume a circular form interlacing with and crossing each other at acute angles. The mucous membrane is provided with a columnar ciliated epithelium, which extends from the middle of the cervix uteri to the extremities of the Fallopian tubes. Vessels and Nerves,—The Arteries of the uterus are the uterine from the internal iliac, and the spermatic from the aorta. The veins are large and remarkable; in the impregnated uterus they are called sinuses, and consist of canals channelled through the substance of the organ, being merely lined by the internal membrane of the veins.621 APPENDAGES OF THE UTERUS. They terminate on each side of the uterus in the uterine plexuses. The lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The Nerves of the uterus are derived from the hypogastric and spermatic plexuses, and from the sacral plexus. They have been made the subject of special investigation by Dr. Robert Lee, who has successfully repaired the omission made by Dr. William Hunter, in this part of the anatomy of the organ. In his numerous dissections of the uterus, both in the unimpregnated and gravid state. Dr. Lee has made the discovery of several large nervous ganglia and plexuses. The principal of these, situated on each side of the cervix uteri imme- diately behind the ureter, he tenns the hypogastric ganglion; it re- ceives the greater number of the nerves from the hypogastric and sacral plexus, and distributes branches to the uterus, vagina, bladder, and rectum. Of the branches to the uterus, a large fasciculus proceeds upwards by the side of the organ towards its angle, where they com- municate with branches of the spermatic plexus, and form another large ganglion, .which he designates the spermatic ganglion^ and which supplies the fundus uteri. Besides these. Dr. Lee describes vesical and vagmcd ganglia, and anterior and posterior suhperitoneal ganglia and plexuses, which communicate with the preceding, and constitute an extensive nervous network over the entire uterus. Dr. Lee con- cludes his observations by remarking :—“These dissections prove that the human uterus possesses a great system of nerves, which enlarges with the coats, blood-vessels, and absorbents, during pregnancy, and which returns after parturition to its original condition before con- ception takes place. It is chiefly by the influence of these nerves that the uterus performs the varied functions of menstruation, con- ception, and parturition, and it is solely by their means that the whole fabric of the nervous system sympathises with the different morbid affections of the uterus. If these nerves of the uterus could not be demonstrated, its physiology and pathology would be com- pletely inexplicable.”* APPENDAGES OF THE UTERUS. The Appendages of the uterus are enclosed by the lateral duplica- tures of peritoneum, called the broad ligaments. They are the Fallo- pian tubes and ovaries. The FALLOPiANf TUBES OF oviducts, the uterine trumpets of the French writers, are situated in the upper border of the broad liga- ments, and are connected with the superior angles of the uterus. They are somewhat trumpet-shaped, being smaller at the uterine than • Philosophical Transactions for 1842. t Gabriel Fallopius, a nobleman of Modena, was one of the founders of mo- dem anatomy. He was Professor at Ferrara, then at Pisa, and afterwards suc- ceeded Vesalius at Padua. His principal observations are collected in a work, “ Observationes Anatomicae,” which ho published in 1561.G22 FALLOPIAN TUBES.—OVARIES. at the free extremity, and narrower in the middle than at either end. Each tiihe is about four or five inches in length, and more or less flexuous in its course. The canal of the Fallopian tube is exceedingly minute; its inner extremity opens by means of the ostium uterinum into the upper angle of the cavity of the uterus, and the opposite end into the cavity of the peritoneum. The free or expanded extremity of the Fallopian tube presents a double and sometimes a triple series of small processes or fringes, which surround the margin of the trumpet or funnel-shaped opening, the ostium abdominale. This fringe-like appendage to the end of the tube has gained for it the appellation of the fimbriated extremity; and the remarkable manner in which this circular fringe applies itself to the surface of the ovary during sexual excitement, the additional title of jnorsus diaholi. A short ligamen- tous cord proceeds from the fimbriated extremity to be attached to the distal end of the ovary, and serves to guide the tube in its seizure of that organ. The Fallopian tube is composed of three timics, an external and loose investment derived from the peritoneum; a middle or muscular coat, consisting of circular [internal] and longitudinal [external] fibres, continuous with those of the uterus; and an internal or lining mucous membrane, which is continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the uterus, and at the opposite extremity with the peri- toneum. In the minute canal of the tube the mucous membrane is thrown into longitudinal folds or rugae, which indicate the adaptation of the tube for dilatation. Tlie Ovaries are two oblong flattened and oval bodies of a whitish colour, situated in the posterior layer of peritoneum of the broad liga- ments. They are connected to the upper angles of the uterus at each side bj"^ means of a rounded cord, consisting chiefly of muscular fibres derived from the uterus, the ligament of the ovary. By the opposite extremity they are connected by another and a shorter ligament to the fimbriated aperture of the Fallopian tube. In structure the ovary is composed of a cellulo-fibrous parenchj'ma or stroma, traversed by blood-vessels, and enclosed in a capsule con- sisting of three layers; a vascular layer, which is situated most inter- nally, and sends processes inwards to the interior of the organ; a middle or fibrous layer of considerable density, and an external invest- ment of peritoneum. In the cells of the stroma of the ovary the small vesicles or ovisacs of the future ova, the Graafian vesicles, as they have been termed, are developed. There are usually about fifteen fully formed Graafian vesicles in each ovary; and Dr. Martin Barry has shewn that countless numbers of microscopic ovisacs exist in the parenchyma of the organ, and that very few out of these are perfected so as to produce ova. After conception, a yellow spot, the corpus luteum, is found in one or both ovaries. The corpus luteum is a globidar mass of yellow, spongy tissue, traversed by white areolar bands, and containing in its centre a small cavity, more or less obliterated, which was originallyEXTERNAL ORGANS OP GENERATION. 623 occupied by the ovum. The interior of the cavity is lined by n puckered membrane, the remains of the ovisac. In recent corpora lutea, the opening by whicli the ovum escaped from the ovisac through the capsule of the ovary is distinctly visible; when closed, a small cicatrix may be seen on the surface of the ovary in the situation of the opening. A similar appearance to the preceding, but of smaller size, and rvithout a central cavity, is sometimes met with in the ovaries of the virgin; this is a false corpus luteum. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the ovaries are the spermatic ; their Tierves are derived from the spermatic plexus. The Round ligaments are two muscular and fibrous cords situ- ated between the layers of the broad ligaments, and extending from the upper angles of the uterus, and along the spermatic canals to the labia majoni, in which they are lost. They are accompanied by a small ar-terj', by several filaments of the spermatic plexus of nerves, and by a plexus of veins. The latter occasionally become varicose, and form a small tumour at the external abdominal ring, which has been mistaken for inguinal hernia. The round ligaments serve to re- tain the uterus in its proper position in the pelvis, and, during utero- gestation, to draw the anterior surface of the organ against the abdo- minal parietes. EXTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION. The female organs of generation are divisible into the internal and external: the internal are contained within the pelvis, and have been already described; they are the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. The external organs are the mens Veneris, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, meatus urinarius, and the opening of the vagina. The Mons Veneris is the eminence of integument, situated upon the front of the ossa pubis. Its areolar tissue is loaded with adipose sub- stance, and the surface covered with hairs. The Labia majora are two large longitudinal folds of integument, consisting of fat and loose areolar tissue. They enclose an elliptical fissure, the common urino-sexual opening or vulva. The vulva re- ceives the inferior opening of the urethra and vagina, and is bounded anteriorly by the commissura superior, and posteriorly by the commis- sura inferior. Stretching across the posterior commissure is a small transverse fold, the frcenulum laI)iorum or fourchette, which is ruptured during parturition ; and immediately ^vithin this fold is a small cavity, the fossa Tiavicidaris. The length of the perineum is measured from the posterior commissure to the margin of the anus, and is usually not more than an inch. The external surface of the labia is covered with hairs ; the inner surface is smooth, and lined by mucous mem- brane, which contains a number of sebiparous follicles, and is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. The use of the labia majora is to favour the extension of the vulva during parturition ; for, in theMAMMARY GLANDS. f)24 passage of the head of the foetus, the labia are unfolded and completely effaced. Thoi Labia minora, or nymphce, are two smaller folds, situated with- in the labia majora. Superiorly they are divided into two processes, which surround the glans clitoridis, the superior fold forming the praeputium clitoridis, and the inferior its fraenulum. Inferiorly, they diminish gradually in size, and are lost on the sides of the opening of the vagina. The nymphas consist of mucous membrane, covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. They are provided with a number of sebiparous follicles, and contain, in their interior, a layer of erectile tissue. The Clitoris is a small elongated organ situated in front of the ossa pubis, and supported by a suspenspry ligament. It is formed by a small body, which is analogous to the corpus cavemosum of the penis, and, like it, arises from the ramus of the os pubis and ischium on each side, by two crura. The extremity of the clitoris is called its ykms. It is composed of erectile tissue, enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, and is susceptible of erection. Like the penis, it is pro- vided with two small muscles, the erectores clitoridis. At about an inch behind the clitoris is the eniranee of the vagina, an elliptical opening, marked by a prominent margin. The entrance to the vagina is closed in the virgin by a membrane of a semilunar form, which is stretched across the opening; this is the hymen. Sometimes the membrane forms a complete septum, and gives rise to great incon- venience by preventing the escape of the menstrual effusion. It is then called an imperforate hymen. The hymen must not be considered a necessary accompaniment of virginity, for its existence is verj' xm- certain. When present, it assumes a variety of appearances : it may be a membranous fringe, with a round opening in the centre, or a semilunar fold, leaving an opening in front; or a transverse septum, having an opening both in front aird behind ; or a vertical band with an opening at either side. The rupture of the hymen, or its rudimentary existence, gives rise to the appearance of a fringe of papillae around the opening of the vagina; these are called carunculce myrtifonnes. The triangular smooth surface between the clitoris and the entrance of the vagina, which is bounded on each side by the upper portions of the nymphae, is the vestibule. At the upper angle of the vagina is an elevation formed by the pro- minence of the upper waU of the canal, and analogous to the bulb ; of the urethra of the male ; and immediately in front of this tubercle, { urinarius. MAMMARY GLANDS. i The Mamma are situated in the pectoral region, and are separated ^ from the pectoralis major muscle by a thin layer of superficial fascia, tMAMMARY GLANDS. 625 They exist in the male as well as in the female, but in a rudimentary state, unless excited into growth by some pecidiar action, such as the loss or atrophy of the testes. Their base is somewhat elliptical, the long diameter corresponding with the direction of the fibres of the pectoralis major muscle; and the left mamma is generally a little larger than the right. Near the centre of the convexity of each mamma is a small promi- nence of the integument, called the 7iipple, which is simrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In the female before impregnation, the colour of the areola is a delicate pink; after impregnation, it assumes a brownish hue, which deepens in colour as pregnancy advances ; and after the birth of a child, the brownish tint continues through life. The areola is furnished with a considerable number of sebiparous follicles, which secrete a peculiar fatty substance for the protection of the delicate integument around the nipple. During suckling these follicles are increased in size, and have the appearance of small pimples, projecting from the skin. At this period they serve by their increased secretion to defend the nipple and areola from the excoriat- ing action of the saliva of the infant. In Structure, the mamma is a conglomerate gland, and consists of lobes, which are held together by a dense and firm areolar tissue; the lobes are composed of lobules, and the lobules of minute caecal vesicles, the ultimate terminations of the excretory ducts. The excretory ducts (tubuli lactiferi), from ten to fifteen in number, commence by small openings at the apex of the nipple, and pass inwards, pa^lel with each other, towards the central part of the gland, where they form dilatations (ampullae), and give off numerous branches to ramify through the gland to their ultimate terminations in the minute lobules. The ducts and caecal vesicles are lined, throughout, by a mucous membrane, which is continuous at the apex of the nipple with the integument. In the nipple the excretory ducts are surrounded by a tissue ana- logous to the dartos of the scrotum, to which the power of erectility of the nipple seems due. There is no appearance of any stnicture resembling erectile tissue. Vessels and Nerves.—The mammae are supplied with arteries from the thoracic branches of the axillary, from the intercostals, and from the internal mammary. The Lymphatics follow the border of the pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The Nerves are derived from the thoracic and intercostals.626 CHAPTER XI. ANATOMY OF THE FCETUS. The medium weight of a child of the full period, at birth, is seven pounds, and its length seventeen inches ; the extremes of weight are four pounds and three quarters, and ten pounds; and the extremes of measurement fifteen and twenty inches. The head is of large size, and lengthened from before backwards ; the face small. The upper extremities are greatly developed, and the thorax expanded and full. The upper past fo the abdomen is large, from the great size of the liver; the lower part is small and conical. And the lower extremities are very small in proportion to the rest of the body. The external genital organs are very large, and fully developed, and the attachment of the umbilicus is one inch farther from the vertex of the head than from the soles of the feet; and one inch farther from the ensiform cartilage than from the symphysis pubis. Osseous system.—The development of the osseous system has been treated of in the first chapter. The ligamentous system presents no peculiarity deserving of remark. Muscular system.—The muscles of the foetus at birth are large and fully formed. They are of a lighter colour than those of the adult, and of softer texture. The transverse striae on the fibres of animal life are not distinguishable imtil the sixth month of foetal life. Vascular system.—The circulating system presents several pe- culiarities : Istly, In the heart; there is a communication between the ^ two auricles by means of the foramen ovale. 2ndly, In the arterial system ; there is a communication between the pulmonary artery and \ descending aorta, by means of a large trunk, the ductus arteriosus. ^ 3rdly, Also in the arterial system; the internal iliac arteries, under ^ the name of hypogastric and umbilical, are continued from the foetus to the placenta, to which they return the blood which has circulated # in the system of the foetus. 4thly, In the venous system ; there is a j communication between the umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava, Jk called the ductus 'cenosus. ] F(ETAL CIRCULATION. ^ The pure blood is brought from the placenta by the umbilical vein. ^ The umbilical vein passes through the umbilicus, and enters the liver, j where it divides into several branches, which may be arranged under j three heads ;—Istly, Two or three, which are distributed to the left fFCETAL CIRCULATION. 627 Fig. 196. * * The fcetal circulation. 1.

G28 lobe. 2(113^, A single branch, which comnuinicates with the portal vein in the transverse fissure, and supplies the right lobe. 3dl}% A large branch, the ductus vcnosus, which passes directl3f backwards, and joins the inferior cava. In the inferior cava the pure blood becomes mixed Avith that which is returning from the lower extremities and abdomi- nal viscera, and is carried through the right auricle, (guided by the Eustachian valve) and through the foramen ovale, into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed, by means of the carotid and subclavian arteries, principally to the head and upper ex- tremities. From the head and upper extremities, the impure blood is returned b3' the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle, it is propelled into the right ventricle; and from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be circulated through the lungs, and oxygenated ; but in the foetus the lungs are solid, and almost impervious. Only a small quantity of the blood passes therefore into the lungs ; the greater part rushes through the ductus arteriosus, into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mingled with that portion of the pure blood which is not sent through the carotid and subclavian arteries. Passing along the aorta, a small quantit}*^ of this mixed blood is dis- tributed by the external iliac arteries to the lower extremities; the greater portion is conve}'ed by the internal iliac, h3'pogastric, and um- bilical arteries to the placenta; the hypogastric arteries proceeding from the internal iliacs, and passing by the side of the fundus of the bladder, and upwards along the anterior Wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, where the}-^ become the umbilical arteries. From a careful consideration of this circulation, we perceive—1st. That the piue blood from the placenta is distributed in considerable quantity to the liver, before entering the general circulation. Hence arises the abundant nutrition of that organ, and its enormous size in comparison Avith other viscera. 2ndly. That the right auricle is the scene of meeting of a double current; the one coming from the inferior cava, the other from the superior, and that they must cross each other in their respective course. How this crossing is effected the theorist Avill wonder ; not so the practical anatomist; for a cnrsory examination of the foetal heart will head and upper extremities through the jugular and subclavian veins, to the superior vena cava (14), to the right auricle (8), and in the course of the arroAV through the right ventricle (16), to the pulmonary artery (16). 17. The ductus arteriosus, Avhich appears to be a proper continuation of the pulmonary artery, the offsets at each side are the right and left pulmonary arte^cut off; these are of extremely small size as compared Avith the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus joins the descending aorta (18, 18), AA'hich diAudes into the common iliacs, and these into the Internal iliacs, Avhich become the hypogastric arteries (19), and return the blood along the umbilical cord to the placenta; Avhile the other divisions, the external iliacs (20), are continued into the loAver extremi- ties. The arroAvs at the tenninations of these vessels mark the return of the venous blood by the veins to the inferior cat'a.POSTAL CIRCULATION. 629 show, 1. That the direction of entrance of the two vessels is so oppo- site, that they may discharge their currents through the same cavity without admixture. 2. That the inferior cava opens almost directly info the left auricle. 3. That by the aid of the Eustachian valve, the current in the inferior cava will be almost entirely excluded from the right ventricle. 3rdly. That the blood which circidates through the arch of the aorta comes directly from the placenta ; and, although mixed with the impure blood of the inferior cava, yet is propelled in so great abund- ance to the head and upper extremitie.s, as to provide for the increased nutrition of those important parts, and prepare them, by their greater size and development, for the functions which they are required to perform at the instant of birth. 4thly. That the blood circulating in the descending aorta is very impure, being obtained principally from the returning current in the superior cava ; a small quantity only being derived from the left ventricle. Yet is it from this impure blood that the nutrition of the lower extremities is provided. Hence we are not surprised at their insignificant development at birth ; while we admire the providence of nature, that directs the nutrient current, in abundance, to the organs of sense, prehension, and deglutition, organs so necessary, even at the instant of birth, to the safety and welfare of the creature. After birth, the foramen ovale becomes gradually closed by a mem- branous layer, which is developed from the margins of the opening from below upwards, and completely separates the two auricles. The situation of the foramen is seen in the adult heart, upon the septum auriculanim, and is called the fossa ovalis ; the prominent margin of the opening is the anmdus ovalis. As soon as the lungs have become inflated by the first act of inspiration, the blood of the pulmonary artery rushes through its right and left branches into the lungs, to be returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary veins. Thus the pulmonary circulation is established. Then the ductus arteriosus contracts, and degenerates into an impervious fibrous cord, serving in after life simply as a bond of union between the left pulmonary artery and the concavity of the arch of the aorta. The current through the umbilical cord being arrested, the umbilical arteries likewise contract and become impervious, and degenerate into the umbilical ligaments of the bladder. The umbilical vein and ductus venosus, also deprived of their cir- culating current, become reduced to fibrous cords, the former being the rauTid ligament of the liver, and the latter a fibrous band which may be traced along the fissure for the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava. Nervous system.—The brain is very soft, almost pulpy, and has a reddish tint throughout; its weight at birth, relatively to the entire body, is as one to six, and the difference between the white and grey sub- stance is not well marked. The nerves are firm and well developed.630 THYROID GLAND, THYMUS GLAND. ORGANS OF SENSE. —The eyeballs are of large size and well developed at birth. The pupil is closed by a vascular membrane called the memhrana, pupillaris, which disappears at about the seventh month. Sometimes it remains permanently, and produces blindness. It consists of two thin membranous layers, between which the ciliary arteries are pro- longed from the edge of the iris, and form arches and loops by return- ing to it again, without anastomosing with those of the opposite side. The removal of the membrane takes place by the contraction of these arches and loops towards the edge of the pupil. The capsule of the lens is extremely vascular. Ear. — The ear is remarkable for its early development; the labyrinth and ossicula auditus are ossified at an early period, and the latter are completely formed before birth. The only parts remaining incomplete are the mastoid cells, and the meatus auditorius. The membrana tympani in the foetal head is very oblique, occupying almost the basilar surface of the skull; hence probably arises a deficient acuteness in the perception of sound. It is also extremely vascular. Nose.—The sense of smell is imperfect in tbe infant, as maj' be inferred from the small capacity of the nasal fossae, and the non-de- velopment of the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses. THYROID GLAND. The Thyroid gland is of large size in the foetus, and is developed by two lateral halves, which approach and become connected at the middle line so as to constitute a single gland. It is doubtful whether it performs any special function in foetal hfe. THYMUS GLAND. The Thymus gland* cansiats “ of a thoracic and a cervical portion on each side. The former is situated in the anterior mediastinum, and the latter is placed in the neck just above the first bone of the '■ sternum, and behind the stemo-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei muscles.” i It extends upwards from the fourth rib as high as the thyroid gland, » resting against the pericardium, and separated from the arch of the : aorta and great vessels by the thoracic fascia in the chest, and Ijdng on each side of the trachea in the neck. Although described usually as a single gland, it consists actually of * In the description of this gland I have adhered closely to the history of it given by Sir Astley Cooper, in his beautiful monograph “ On the Anatomy of tho Thjmus Gland;” 1832.THYMUS GLAND. 631 two lateral, almost symmetrical glands, connected witli each other by areolar tissue only, and having no structural communication: they may therefore be “ properly called, a right and left thymus gland.” Between the second and third months of embryonic existence, the thymus is so small as to be only “just perceptibleand continues gradually increasing Avith the growth of the foetus until the seventh. At the eighth month it is large; but, during the ninth, it undergoes a sudden change, assumes a greatly increased size, and at birth weighs 240 grains. After birth it continues to enlarge until the expiration of the first year, when it ceases to grow, and gradually diminishes, until at puberty it has almost disappeared. The thjTuus is a conglomerate gland, being composed of lobules dis- posed in a spiral form around a central cavity. The lobules are held together by a firm areolar tissue (“ reticulated”), and the entire gland is enclosed in a coarse areolo-fibrous capsule. Fig. 197.* The Lobules are very numerous, and \'ary in size from that of the head of a pin to a moderate-sized pea. Each lobule contains in its interior a small cavity, or “ secretory cell," and several of these cells • A section of the thymus gland at the eighth month, shewing its anatomy'. This figure, and the succeeding, were drawn from two of Sir Astley Cooper’s beautiful preparations, with the kind permission of their possessor. The refer- ences were made by Sir Astley’s own band. 1. The cervical portions of the gland; the independence of the two lateral glands is well marked. 2.

Fig. 198.* open into a small '•'•pouch" which is situated at their base, and leads to the central cavity, the "reservoir of the thymus." The Jieservo'ir is lined in its in- terior by a vascular mucous mem- brane, which is raised into ridges by a layer of ligamentous bands situated beneath it. The liga- mentous bands proceed in various directions, and encircle the open mouths {pores) of the secretory cells and pouches. This ligament- ous layer serves to keep the lo- bules together, and prevent the injurious distension of the cavity. When either gland is carefully unravelled by removing the areolar capsule and vessels, and dissecting away the reticulated areolar tissue which retains the lobules in con- tact, the reservoir, from being folded in a serpentine manner upon itself, admits of being drawn out into a lengthened tubular cord,+ around which the lobules are clustered in a spiral manner, and resemble knots upon a cord, or a string of beads. The reservoir, pouches, and cells, contain a white fluid “ like chyle,” or “like cream, but with a small admixture of red globules.” In an examination of the thymic fluid which I lately (1840) made, with a Powell microscope magnify- ing 600 times linear measure, I observed that the corpuscles were very niunerous, smaller than the blood particles, globular and oval in form, irregular in outline, variable in size, and provided with a small central nucleus. In the human fetus this fluid has been found by Sir Astley Cooper * The course and termination of the “absorbent ducts” of the thymus of the calf; from one of Sir Astley Cooper’s preparations. 1.

But the thymic fluid of the foetal calf, which exists in great abundance, gave the following analytical* results: one hundred parts of the fluid con- tained sixteen parts of solid matter, which consisted of. Incipient fibrine. Albumen, Mucus, and muco-extractive matter. Muriate and phosphate of potass. Phosphate of soda. Phosphoric acid, a trace. According to the researches of Mr. Simont and Oesterlen the thymus is composed of polygonal and mutually flattened membranous cells, measuring from half a line to two lines in diameter and arranged in conical masses around a central cavity. Each cell is surrounded by a capillary plexus and connected to neighbouring cells by areolar tissue intermingled with elastic fibres. The corpuscles found in the fluid of the thymus are dotted nuclei measuring -ggVo diameter; and are subject to conversion into nucleated cells and fat-cells. The Arteries of the thjunus gland are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The Veins terminate in the left vena innominata, and some small branches in the thyroid veins. The Nerves are very minute, and are derived chiefly, through the internal mammary plexus, from the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. Sir Astley Cooper has also seen a branch from the junction of the pneumogastric and sympathetic pass to the side of the gland. The Li/mpliatics terminate in the general union of the lymphatic vessels at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. Sir Astley Cooper has injected them only once in the human foetus, but in the calf he finds two large lymphatic ducts, which commence in the upper extremities of the glands, and pass downwards, to terminate at the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein at each side. These vessels he considers to be the “ absorbent diicts of the glands; ‘ thymic ducts;' they are the carriers of the fluid from the thjTuus into the veins.” Sir Astley Cooper concludes his anatomical description of this gland with the follo\ving observations:— “As the thymus secretes all the parts of the blood, viz. albumen, fibrine, and particles, is it not probable that the gland is designed to prepare a fluid well fitted for the foetal growth and nourishment from the blood of the mother, before the birth of the foetus, and, conse- quently, before chyle is formed from food ?—and this process continues * This analysis was conducted by Dr. Dowler of Richmond. 1' “ A Physiological Essay on the Thymus Gland,” 4to. 1845.034 FCETAI. HEART.—VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. lor a short time after birth, the quantity of fluid secreted from the thymus gradually declining as that of chylification becomes perfectly established.” FCETAL LUNGS. The Lungs, previously to the act of inspiration, are dense and solid in structure, and of a deep red colour. Their specific gravity is greater than water, in which they sink to the bottom ; whereas lung which has respired will float upon that fluid. The specific gravity is, however, no test of the real weight of the lung, the respired lung being actually heavier than the foetal. Thus the weight of the foetal lung, at about the middle period of uterine life, is • to the weight of the body as 1 to 60.* But, after respiration, the relative weight of the lung to the entire body is as 1 to 30. FCETAL HEART. The Heart of the foetus is large in proportion to the size of the body; it is also developed very early, representing at first a simple vessel, and undergoing various degrees of complication until it arrives at the compound character which it presents after birth. The two ventricles form, at one period, a single cavity, which is afterwards divided into two by the septum ventriculonim. The two auricles communicate up to the moment of birth, the septum being incomplete, and leaving a large opening between them, \\\& foramen ovale (foramen of Botal+). The Ductus arteriosus is another peculiarity of the foetus connected with the heart; it is a communication between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. It degenerates into a fibrous cord after birth, from the double cause, of a diversion in the current of the blood towards the lungs, and from the pressure of the left bronchus, caused its dis- tension with air. VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. At an early period of uterine life, and sometimes at the period of birth, as I have twice observed in the imperfectly developed foetus, two minute fibrous threads may be seen passing from the umbilicus to the mesentery. These are the remains of the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. The Omphalo-mesenteric are the first developed vessels of the germ: they ramify upon the vesicula umbilicalis, or yolk-bag, and supply the newly formed alimentary canal of the embryo. From them, as from a centre, the general circulating system is produced. After the estab- * Cniveilhier, Anatomie Descriptive, vol. ii. p. 621. t Leonard Botal, of Piedmont, was the first of the modems who gave an account of this opening, in a work published in 1565. His description is veiy imperfect. The foramen was well known to Galen.635 FCETAL LIVER.—SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. lishment of the placental circulation they cease to cany blood, and dwindle to the size of mere threads, which may be easily demonstrated in the early periods of uterine life ; but are completely removed, ex- cepting under peculiar circumstances, at a later period. The Stomach is of small size, and the great extremity but little de- veloped. It is also more vertical in direction the earlier it is examined, a position that would seem due to the enormous magnitude of the liver, and particularly of its left lobe. The Appendix venniformis cceci is long and of large size, and is con- tinued directly from the central part of the cul-de-sac of the caecum, of which it appeal’s to be a constricted continuation. This is the charac- ter of the appendix caeci in the higher quadrumana. The large intestines are filled with a dark green viscous secretion, called meco7iium {ftnxuv, poppy), from its resemblance to the inspissated juice of the poppy. The Pancreas is comparatively larger in the foetus than in the adidt. The Spleen is comparatively smaller in the foetus than in the adult. F(ETAL LIVER. The Liver is the first formed organ in the embryo. It is developed from the alimentary canal, and at about the third week, fills the whole abdomen, and is one-half the weight of the entire embryo. At the fourth month the liver is of immense size in proportion to the bulk of the foetus. At birth it is of very large size, and occupies the whole upper part of the abdomen. The left lobe is as large as the right, and the falciform ligament corresponds with the middle line of the body. The liver diminishes rapidly after birth, probably from obliteration of the umbilical vein. KIDNEYS AND SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The Kidneys present a lobulated appearance in the foetus, which is their permanent type amongst some animals, as the bear, the otter, and cetacea. The Supra-renal capsules are organs which appear, from their early and considerable development, to belong especially to the economy of the foetus. They are distinctly formed at the second month of em- bryonic life, and are greater in size and weight than the kidneys. At the third or fourth month, they are equalled in bulk by the kid- neys ; and at birth they are about one-third less than those organs. VISCERA OF THE PELVIS. The Bladder in the foetus is long and conical, and is situated alto- gether above the upper border of the ossa pubis, which are as yet small636 TESTES. and undeveloped. It is, indeed, an abdominal viscus, and is connected superiorly with a fibrous cord, called the urachus, of which it appears to be an expansion. The Urachus is continued upwards to the umbilicus, and becomes connected with the umbilical cord. In animals it is a pervious duct, and is continuous with one of the membranes of the embryo, the allantois. It has been found pervious in the human fetus, and the urine has been passed through the umbilicus. Calculous concretions have also been found in its course. The Uterus, in the early periods of embryonic existence, appears bifid, from the large size of the Fallopian tubes, and the small develop- ment of the body of the organ. At the end of the fourth month, the body assumes a larger bulk, and the bifid appearance is lost. The cervix uteri in the fetus is larger than the body of the organ. The Ovaries are situated, like the testicles, in the lumbar region, near the kidneys, and descend from thence, gradually, into the pel- vis. TESTES. The Testicles in the embryo are situated in the lumbar regions, im- mediately in front of and somewhat below the kidneys. They have, connected with them inferiorly, a peculiar structure, which assists in their descent, and is called the gubemaculum testis. The Gubemaculum is a soft and conical cord composed of areolar tissue containing in its areolae a gelatiniform fluid. In the abdomen it lies in front of the psoas muscle, and passes along the spermatic canal, which it serves to distend for the passage of the testis. It is attached by its superior and larger extremity to the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and by the inferior extremity to the bottom of the scrotum. The gubemaculum is surrounded by a thin layer of muscular fibres, the cremaster, which pass upwards upon this body to be attached to the testis. Inferiorly, the muscular fibres divide into three processes, which, according to Mr. Curling,* are thus attached: “ The external and broadest is connected to Poupart’s ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle forms a lengthened band, which escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends to the bottom of the scrotum, Avhere it joins the dartos; the internal passes in the direction inwards, and has a firm attachment to the os pubis and sheath of the rectus muscle. Besides these a number of muscular fibres are reflected from the internal oblique on the fi-ont of the gubemaculum.” The Descent of the testicle is gradual and progressive. Between the fifth and sixth months it has reached the lower part of the psoas muscle, and during the seventh it makes its way through the sper- matic canal, and descends into the scrotum. ♦ See an excellent paper “ On the Structure of the Gubemaculum,” &c., by Mr. Curling, Lecturer on Morbid Anatomy in the London Hospital, in the Lancet, vol. ii. 1840-41, p. 70.DESCENT OF THE TESTIS, G37 While situated in the lumbar region, the testis and gubemaculum are placed behind the peritoneum, by which they are invested upon their anterior surface and sides. As they descend, the investing peri- toneum is carried downwards with the testis into the scrotum, forming a lengthened pouch, which by its upper extremity opens into the cavity of the peritoneum. The upper part of this pouch, being compressed by the spermatic canal, is gradually obliterated, the obliteration extending downwards along the spermatic cord nearly to the testis. That portion of the peritoneum which immediately surrounds the testis is, by the above process, cut off from its continuity with the peritoneum, and is termed the tunica vaginalis ; and as this membrane must be obviously Fig. 199.* Fig. 200. t a shut sac, one portion of it investing the testis, and the other being reflected so as to form a loose bag around it, its two portions have re- ceived the appellations of tunica vaginalis propria, and tunica vaginalis reflexa. The descent of the testis is effected by means of the traction of the muscle of the gubemaculum (cremaster). “ The fibres,” writes Mr. Curling, J “ proceeding from Poupart’s ligament and the obliquus in- * A diagram illustrating the descent of the testis. 1.

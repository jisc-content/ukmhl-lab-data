235 POSTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. Posterior Humeral Region. Triceps extensor cubiti. Dissection.—Remove the integument and fascia from the posterior aspect of the upper arm. The Triceps Kt(paXai, three heads,) arises by three heads. Considered in relation to their length, these heads have been named long, short, and middle; and in re- ference to their position, internal. Fig. 99.* external, and middle ; the term middle, in the former case, referring to the external head, and in the latter case to the long head. This has given rise to much confusion and misunderstanding. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the de- signations derived from their rela- tions. The external head arises from the humerus, commencing im- mediately below the insertion of the teres minor, and from the intermus- cular septum attached to the exter- nal condyloid ridge. The internal head (short) arises from the hume- rus, commencing immediately below the insertion of the teres major, and from the intermuscular septum attached to the internal condyloid ridge. The scapular head (long) lies between the two others, and arises from the upper third of the inferior border of the scapula. The ; three heads unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted by an apo- neurotic tendon into the olecranon j process of the ulna; a small bursa is situated between this tendon and the upper part of the olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and : major, and divides the triangular 'Space between those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The triangular space is bounded : by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps ; it • A posterior view of the upper arm, shewing the triceps muscle. 1. Its ex- ternal head. 2.

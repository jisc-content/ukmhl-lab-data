STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE. 113 Cartilage cells have an average measurement of ™ their long di.ometer ; they are sometimes isolated, sometimes grouped Fig. 48.* Fig 49.1' in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. They are larger near the bone than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender in form, and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish and opaline in colour, and its intercellular substance is semitransparent and structureless. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify. In the latter case the intercellular substance be- comes fibrous and more or less opaque, its colour is yellowish, and the cells are found to contain a greater number of oil- globules than in its natural state. The true cartilages are, the articular, costal, ensiform, thyroid, cricoid, ary- tenoid, tracheal and bronchial, nasal, meatus auris, the pulley of the troch- learis muscle, and temporary cartilage, or the cartilage of bone previously to ossification.§ Reticular cartilage is composed of cells in dia- • Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage.

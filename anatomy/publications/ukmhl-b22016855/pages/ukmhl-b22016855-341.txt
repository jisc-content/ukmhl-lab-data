325 BRACHIAL ARTERY. BRACHIAL ARTERY. j The Brachial artery passes do^vIl the inner side of the ann, from i the lower border of the latissimus dorsi to the bend of the elbow, I where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. I Belatims.—In its course downwards, it rests upon the coraco- j brachialis muscle, internal head of the triceps, brachialis anticus, and the tendon of the biceps. To its inner side is the ulnar nerve; to the outer side, the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles ; in front it has : the basilic vein, and is crossed by the median nerve. Its relations, within its sheath, are the venm comites. I ' Plan of the relations of the Brachial Artery. ! In Front. i Basilic vein, j Deep fascia, , Median nerve. Outer Side. Coraco-brachialis, Biceps. Behind. Short head of triceps, Coraco-brachialis, Brachialis anticus. Tendon of Biceps. The branches of the brachial artery are, the— Superior profunda, Inferior profunda, Anastomotica magna. Muscular. The Superior profunda arises opposite the lower border of the latis- simus dorsi, and winds around the humerus, between the triceps and I the bone, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator ; longus, where it inosculates with the radial recurrent branch. It ac-. . companies the musculo-spiral nerve. In its course it gives off the pos- : terior articular artery, which descends to the elbow-joint, and a more ■ superficial branch which inosculates with the interosseous articular lartery. The Inferior profunda arises from about the middle of the brachial 1 artery, and descends to the space between the inner condyle and ole- ■ cranon in company with the ulnar nerve, where it inosculates with the : posterior ulnar recurrent The Anastomotica magna is given off nearly at right angles from the inner oiae. Ulnar nerve.

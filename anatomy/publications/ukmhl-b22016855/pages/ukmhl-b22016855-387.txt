SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS. 371 The Superior longitudinal sinus is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen csetum in the frontal, to the inner tuberosity of the occipital bone, where it divides into the two lateral sinuses. It is triangular in form, is small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives the superior cerebral veins which open into it obliquely, numerous small veins from the diploe, and near the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture the parietal mins, from the pericraniujn and scalp. Examined in its interior, it presents numerous transverse fibrous bands (trabeculae) the chordae Willisii, which are stretched across its inferior angle ; and some small white granular masses, the glandulae Pacchioni; the oblique openings of the cerebral veins, with their valve-like margin, are also seen on the walls of the sinus. The termination of the superior longitudinal sinus in the two lateral sinuses forms a considerable dilatation, into which the straight sinus opens from the front, and the occipital sinuses from below.

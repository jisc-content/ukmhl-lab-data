DORSAL INTEROSSEI. 249 T , j. ^ one dorsal (abductor rndicis). Index nnqer ; , • ‘ ( one palmar. cuddle finger, two dorsal. T>- j: 1 one dorsal, lunq nnqer 1 , ^ ^ ( one palmar. Liille finger, remaining palmar. Relations.—By their dorsal stcr/ace with a thin aponeurosis which separates them from the tendons on the dorsum of the hand. By their ■palmar surface with the muscles and tendons in the palm of the hand. By one side with the metacarpal bone ; by the other with the corres- ponding palmar interosseous. The abductor indicis is in relation by its palmar surface, with the adductor pollicis, the arteria magna pollicis being interposed. The radial artery passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Actions.—The actions of the muscles of the hand are expressed in their names. Those of the radial region belong to the thumb, and provide for three of its movements, abduction, addvjction, and fieodon. The ulnar group, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger, and the interossei are abductors and adductors of the several fingers. The lumbricales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexors : they were called by the earlier anatomists fidicinii, i. e. fiddlers’ muscles, from an idea that they might effect the fractional movements by which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. In relation to the axis of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are ab- ductors, and the three palmar, adductors. It will therefore be seen that each finger is pro^^ded with its proper adductor and abductor, two flexors, and (with the exception of the middle and ring fingers) two extensors. The thumb has moreover a flexor and extensor of the metacarpal bone ; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone without an extensor. a

165 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. composed of ultimate fibres having the transverse striae of the muscle of animal life. The muscles may be arranged in conformity with the general divi- sion of the body into,—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The muscles of the head and neck admit of a subdivision into those of the head and face, and those of the neck. JMuscles of the Head and Face.—These muscles may be divided into groups corresponding with the natural regions of the head and face ; the groups are eight in number, viz.— 1. Cranial group. 2. Orbital group. 3. Ocular group. 4. Nasal group. 5. 6. 7. 8. Superior labial group. Inferior labial group^ Maxillary group. Auricular group. The muscles of each of these groups may be thus arranged— 1. Cranial group. Occipito-frontalis. 2. Orbital group. Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii. Tensor tarsi. 3. Ocular group. Levator palpebrae. Rectus superior. Rectus inferior. Rectus intemus, Rectus extemus, Obliquus superior, Obliquus inferior. 4. Nasal group. Pyramidalis nasi. Compressor nasi. Dilatator naris. 5. Superior labial group, (Orbicularis oris), Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. Levator labii superioris proprius, Levator anguli oris, Zygomaticus major, Zygomaticus minor. Depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi. 6. Inferior labial group, (Orbicularis oris),* Depressor labii inferioris. Depressor angidi oris, Levator labii inferioris. 7. Maxillary group. Masseter, Temporalis, Buccinator, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. 8. Auricular group). Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Retrahens aurem. * The orbicularis oris, from encircling the mouth, belongs necessarily to both the superior and inferior labial regions ; it is therefore enclosed within parentheses in both.

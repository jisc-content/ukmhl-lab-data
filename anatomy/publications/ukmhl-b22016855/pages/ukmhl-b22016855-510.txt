494 SACllAL GANGLIA. common iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral por tions, which communicate with branches from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves. It distributes branches to all the viscera of the pelvis, and sends filaments which accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. SACRAL GANGLIA. The Sacral ganglia are four or five in number on each side. They are situated upon the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connection, although much smaller in size. The superior and inferior branches communicate with the ganglia above and below. The external branches communicate 'with the sacral nerves. The internal branches communicate very freely with the lateral divisions of the hypogastric plexus, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos. This ganglion resembles in its position and function the ganglion of Ribes, serving to connect the inferior ex- tremity of the sympathetic system, as does the former ganglion its upper extremity. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum.

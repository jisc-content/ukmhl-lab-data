397 THORACIC DUCT. phatic vessels generally; at its termination it is pro- vided with a pair of semi- lunar valves, which prevent the admission of venous blood into its cylinder. Branches.—The thoracic duct receives at its com- mencement four or five large lymphatic trunks, which unite to form the recepta- culum chyli: it next re- ceives the trunks of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax it is joined by a large lymphatic trunk from the liver, and in its course through the posterior me- diastinum, receives the lym- phatic vessels both from the viscera andfrom the parietes of the thorax. At its curve forwards in the neck it is joined by the lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, left upper extremity, and from the upper part of the thorax, and thoracic viscera. The Dttcitis lymphaticm deoier is a short trunk which receives the lymphatic ves- sels from the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, right lung, and one or two branches from the liver, and termi- nates at the junction of the Fig. 139. * * The course and termination of the thoracic duct. 1.

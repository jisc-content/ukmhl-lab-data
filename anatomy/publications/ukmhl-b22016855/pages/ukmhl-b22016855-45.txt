29 TEMPORAL BONE. Articulations.—With tivelve hones ; the two parietal, the sphenoid, ethmoid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To hvo pairs: corrugator supercilii, and temporal. Temporal Bone.—The temporal hone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The Squamous portion, forming the anterior part of the hone, is thin, ti-anslucent, and contains no diploe. Upon its external surface it is smooth, to give attachment to the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle, and has projecting from it an arched and length- Fig. 17.* ened process, the zygoma. Near the commencement of the zygoma, upon its lower border, is a projection called the tubercle, to which is attached the external lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and continued horizontally inwards from the tubercle, a rounded emi- • The external surface of the temporal bone of the left side. 1.

121 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The SuprorspiTious ligament (fig. 62) is a strong and inelastic fibrous cord, which extends from the apex of the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum, being attached to each spinous process in its course ; it is thickest in the lumbar region. The continuation of this ligament upwards to the tuberosity of the occipital bone, con- xiSUf'S- stitutes the rudimentary ligamentum nuchse of man. The latter is strengthened, as in animals, by a thin slip from the spinous process of each of the cervical vertebrae. Transverse processes.—The inter-transverse ligaments are thin and membranous ; they are found only between the transverse pro- cesses of the lower dorsal vertebrae. 2. Articulation of the AUas with the Occipital bone.—The ligaments of this articulation are seven in number,— Two anterior occipito-atloid. Posterior occipito-atloid. Lateral occipito-atloid. Two capsular. Of the two anterior ligaments one is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line, and superficially to the other. It is attached above, to • An anterior view of the ligaments connecting the atlas, the axis, and the occipital bone. A transverse section has been carried through the base of the skull, dividing the basilar process of the occipital bone and the petrous portions of the tempo^ bones. 1.

The anterior atlo-axoid ligament, which is continuous Inferiorly with the commencement of the anterior common ligament, 5. One of the atlo-axoid capsular ligaments; the one on the opposite side has been re- moved, to shew the approximated surfaces of the articular processes (6). 7. One of the occipito-atloid capsular ligaments. The most external of these fibres constitute the lateral occipito-atloid ligament.

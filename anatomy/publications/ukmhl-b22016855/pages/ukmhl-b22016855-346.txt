330 ULNAR ARTERY.—HRANCHES. brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accompanied in its course by the vence comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two-thirds of its extent. Plan of the relations of the Ulnar Artery. In Front. Deep fascia, Superficial layer of muscles, Median nerve. In the Hand, Tendinous arch from the pisiform bone, Palmaris brevis muscle. Palmar fascia. Inmi' Side. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulnar nerve (lower two thirds). Behind. Brachialis anticus. Flexor profundus digitorum. Pronator quadratus. In the Hand. ■ Annular ligament. Tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum. OvJter Side. Flexor sublimis digi- torum. The Branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged, like those of the radial, into three groups ;— Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent. Interosseous, \ Anterior interosseous. ( Posterior interosseous. Muscular. Carpalis anterior, Carpalis posterior. Digi tales. : ■1 The Anterior ulnar recurrent arises immediate!}’’ below the elbow, and ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and ' brachialis anticus, where it inosculates with the anastomotica magna ' and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by ■ a common trunk. '1 The Posterior ulnar recurrent., larger than the preceding, arises im-.; mediately below the elbow joint, and passes backwards beneath the 1 origins of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends between 1 the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and beneath the ulnar nerve, \ and inosculates with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. i Fore-arm, Wrist, Hand,

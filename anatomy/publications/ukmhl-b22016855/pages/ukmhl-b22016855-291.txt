275 MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. The great toe, like the thumb in the hand, enjoys an independent action, and is provided with distinct muscles to perform its move- ments. These movements are precisely the same as those of the other toes, viz.: Flexion. Exteiision. Flexor longus pollicis, f'lexor brevis pollicis. Extensor proprius pollicis. Extensor brevis digitorum. Adduction. Abduction. Adductor pollicis. Abductor pollicis. The only muscles excluded from this table aiâ€™e the lumbricales, four small muscles, which, from their attachments to the tendons of the long flexor, appear to be assistants to its action; and the transversus pedis, a small muscle placed transverselj^ in the foot across the heads of the metatarsal bones. The latter has for its office the drawing to- gether of the toes.

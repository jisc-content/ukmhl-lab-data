583 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER, weighing about four pounds, and measuring through its longest diame- ter about twelve inches. It is situated in the right hypochondriac re- gion, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondriac, freijuently reaching, by its left extremity, the upper end of the spleen. It is placed obliquely in the abdomen; its convex surface looking up- wards and forwards, and the concave downwards and backwards. The anterior border is sharp and free, and marked by a deep notch, and the posterior rounded and broad. It is in relation, superiorly and pos- teriorly, with the diaphragm; and inferiorly, with the stomach, as- cending portion of the duodenum, transverse colon, right supra-reiial capsule, and right kidney; and corresponds, by its free border, with the lower margin of the ribs. Fig. 182.* Ligaments.—The liver is retained in its place by five ligaments; four of which are duplicatures of the peritoneum, and are situated on the convex surface of the organ; the fifth is a fibrous cord which passes through a fissure in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava. They are the— Longitudinal, Two lateral, Coronar}', Round. * The upper surface of the liver. 1. The right lobe. 2. The left lobe. 3. The anterior or free border. 4 The posterior or rounded border. 5.

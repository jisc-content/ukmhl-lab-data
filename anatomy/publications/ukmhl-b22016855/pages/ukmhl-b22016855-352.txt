SUrERIOIl MESENTERIC ARTERY. 336 curve of the stomach, lying between the layers of the great omentum, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra. It is distributed to the greater curve of the stomach and to the great omentum. Fig. 125.* The Superior mesenteric artery, the second of the single trunks, \ and next in size to the coeliac axis, arises from the aorta immediately ] below that vessel, and behind the pancreas. It passes forwards ^ between the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and descends within the layers of the mesentery, to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates ' * The distribution of the branches of the cceliac axis. 1.

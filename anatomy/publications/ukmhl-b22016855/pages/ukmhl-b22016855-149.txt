133 LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. part of the boundary of the lesser ischiatic foramen, and by its lower border, a part of the boundary of the perineum.^ It is pierced by the coccygeal branch of the ischiatic artery. The two ligaments convert the sacro-ischiatic notches into foramina. Fig. 64.* 3. Between the Sacrum and Coccyx,—The anterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thin fasciculus passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The posterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and connects the sacrum with the coccyx posteriorly, extending as far as the apex of the latter bone. Between the two bones is a thin disk of soft fibrous cartilage. In females there is frequently a small synovial membrane. This articu- lation admits of a certain degree of movement backwards during parturition. • Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint.

574 JEJUNUM. ILEUM, The Jejunum (jejunus, empty) is named from being generally found empty. It forms the upper two-fifths of the small intestine; commeno- ing at the duodenum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the ileum. It is thicker to the touch than the rest of the intestine, and has a pinkish tinge from containing more mucous membrane than the ileum. Fig. 180.* The TIeum (Iâ€™lxuv, to twist, to convolute) includes the remaining three- fifths of the small intestine. It is somewhat smaller in calibre, thinner in texture, and paler than the jejunum; but there is no mark by which to distinguish the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. It terminates in the right iliac fossa, by opening at an obtuse angle into the colon. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded, above and at the sides, by * A vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum, made in such a direction as to include the two orifices of the stomach. 1. The oesopha- gus ; upon its internal surface the plicated arrangement of the cuticnlar epithe- lium is shewn. 2. The cardiac orifice of the stomach, around which the fringed border of the cuticular epithelium is seen. 3. The gi'eat end of the stomach. I. Its lesser or pyloric end. 5. The lesser curve. 6. The greater curve. 7. The dilatation at the lesser end of the stomach, which has received from AVillis the name of antrum of the pylorus. This may be regarded as the rudiment of a se- cond stomach. 8. The rugoe of the stomach formed by the mucous membrane; their longitudinal direction is shewn. 9. The pylorus. 10. The oblique portion of the duodenum. 11. The descending-portion. 12. The pancreatic duct and the ductus communis choledochus close to their termination. 13. The papilla upon which.the ducts open. 14. The transverse portion of the duodenum. 15. The commencement of the jejunum. In the interior of the duodenum and jejunum, the valvulse conniventes are seen.

The broad end, direct- ed forwards, rests against the corpus striatum of the opposite side: the small end, backwards, is separated from its fellow by the interpo- Fig. 142.* I • The lateral ventricles of the cerebrum. 1, 1. The two hemispheres cut ■* lown to a level with the corpus callosum so as to constitute the centrum ovale piuajus. The surface is seen to be studded with the small vascular points— *^ouncta vasculosa; and surrounded by a narrow margin which represents the -p-ey substance. 2. A small portion of the anterior extremity (genu) of the •norpus callosum. 3. Its posterior boundary (splenium); the intemiediate por- tion forming the roof of the lateral ventricles has been removed so as to ex- oose completely those cavities. 4 A part of the septum lucidum, shewing an r.nterspace between its layei-s—the fifth ventricle 5. The anterior cornu of one '.;lde. 6. The commencement of the middle cornu. 7. The posterior cornu. . TTie corpus striatum of one ventricle. 9. The tenia semicircularis covered ■y the vena corporis striati and tenia Tarini. 10. A small part of the thalamus pticus. 11. The dark fringe-like body to the left of the numeral is the choroid i lexus. This plexus communicates with that of the opposite ventricle through he foramen of iMonro, or foramen commune anterius; a bristle is passed -rough this opening (under figure 4), and its extremities are seen resting on e corpus striatum at each side. The figure 11 rests upon the edge of the for- : ix, on that part of it which is called the corpus fimbriatum. 12. The fornix. ■'3. Tlie commencement of the hippocampus major descending into the middle omu. The rounded oblong body in the posterior comu of the lateral ventricle, •irectly behind the figui'e 13, is the hippocampus minor.

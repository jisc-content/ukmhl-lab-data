125 LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. some fibres are sent downwards to be attached to the body of the axis, and others pass upwards to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone ; hence the ligament has a cross-like appearance, and has been denominated cmciforin. A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligament and the odontoid process ; and another between that process and the inner surface of the anterior arch of the atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiar disposition of this ligament in relation to the odontoid process, that enables the atlas, and with it the entire cranium, to rotate upon the axis ; the perfect freedom of movement between these bones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower part of the ring, formed by the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, while the smnmit of the odontoid process is larger than its base ; so that the process is still retained in its position by the transverse ligament, when the other ligaments are cut through. The extent to which the rotation of the head upon the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axoid ligament. 5. Articulation of the Lower Jaw.—The lower jaw has properly but one ligament, the external lateral; the ligaments usually described are three in number ; to which may be added, as appertaining to the mechanism of the joint, an interarticular fibrous-cartilage, and two synovial membranes,— External lateral. Internal lateral. Capsular. Interarticular fibrous cartilage, Two synovial membranes. • An external view of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1. The zygomatic arch. 2. The tubercle of the zygoma. 3.

PREFACE. In preparing the “ Anatomist’s Vade Mecum,” for the fourth time, for the Press, the Author has availed him- self of the discoveries, in Anatomy, -which have been made public since the appearance of the preceding edition; and he takes the opportunity, now alforded him, of acknowledging his obligation to the several investigators whose researches he has quoted. To one gentleman, namely, to Mr. Paget of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, he feels particularly indebted for the assistance which he has derived from the excellent “Reports, on the chief results obtained by the use of the Microscope in the study of Human Anatomy and Physiology,” published in the British and Foreign Medical Review. In the present edition of this volume, the Wood-cut Illustrations have been augmented to two hundred; and the Author begs to observe that, with very few exceptions, which have been duly acknowledged, the whole of the subjects are original; the drawings having been executed by Mr. Bagg from dissections prepared expressly for the work, or from drawings made by himself. The chief of the illustrations of General Anatomy were drawn from the microscope with the camera lucida, in order to ensure absolute correctness.

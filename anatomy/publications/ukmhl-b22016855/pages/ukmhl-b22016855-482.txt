INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. 46C ( posterior. Tlie anterior liranch, f the larger of the two, divides into | several branches which pass in I front of, and sometimes behind, * the median basilic vein at the ' bend of the elbow, and descend ! in the course of the palmaris Ion- â€™ gus muscle to the wrist, distribut- i ing filaments to the integument in their course and commiuiicating with the anterior branch of the external cutaneous on the outer j side, and its own posterior branch \ on the inner side of the fore-arm. j The posterior branch sends off se- i veral twigs to the integument over the inner condyle and olecranon, and then descends the fore-arm in the course of the ulnar vein as far as the wrist, suppl}ring the integu- . ment on the inner side of the fore- arm and commimicating with the anterior branch of the same nerve in front, and the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve on the wrist. The Lesser internal cuta- neous NERVE or nerve of Wrisierg, the smallest of the branches of the brachial plexus, is very irregular in point of origin. It is a long and slender nerve, and usually arisesfrom the common trunk of the last cervi- cal and first dorsal nerve. Passing j downwards into the axillary space : it communicates vuth the external t branch of the first intercosto-hume- i ral nerve, and descends on the inner side of the internal cutaneous * The Brachial plexus of nerves with its branches and their distribution. 1.

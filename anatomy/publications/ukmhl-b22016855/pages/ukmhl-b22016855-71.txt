SUPERIOR REGION OF THE SKULL. 55 ] occipital bone and occipital protuberance. It is crossed transversely l' by the coronal suture, and marked from before backwards by the I sagittal, which terminates posteriorly in the lambdoid sutiu-e. Near Fig. 29.* ( the posterior extremity of the region, and on each side of the sagittal ^ suture, is the parietal foramen. Upon the inner or cerebral,surf ace of this region is a shallow groove, J extending along the middle line from before backwards, for the supe- rior longitudinal sinus ; on either side of this groove are several small ^ • The cerebral surface of the base of the skull. 1. One side of the anterior fossa; the number is placed on the roof of the orbit, formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone. 2. The lesser wing of the sphenoid. 3. The crista i galli. 4. The foramen ciecum. 5. The cribrifonu lamella of the ethmoid. ; 6. The processus olivaris. 7. Tlic foramen opticuni. 8. The anterior clinoid process. 9. 'fhe carotid groove upon the side of the sella turcica, for the in- ternal carotid artery and cavernous sinus. 10, 11, 12. The middle fossa of the ' base of the skull. 10. Marks the gi’cat ala of the sphenoid. 11. The squamous ' portion of the temporal bone. 12. The petrous portion of the temporal. 13. The sella turcica. 14. The basilar portion of the sphenoid and occipital bone (clivus Blumenbachii). The uneven ridge between Nos. 13, 14, is the dorsum ephippii, and the prominent angles of this ridge the posterior clinoid j processes. 15. The foramen rotundum. 16. The foramen ovale. 17. The ! foramen spinosum; the small irregular opening between 17 and 12 is the hiatus Fallopii. 18. Tlie posterior fossa of the base of the skull. 19, 19. Tlic groove for the lateral sinus. 20. The ridge upon the occipital bone, which gives attachment to the falx cerebelli. 21. The foramen magnum. 22. Tlie meatus 'H auditorius internus. 23. The jugular foramen.

I'NEUMOGAS'J'HIC NERVE. 454 /â€¢%. 161.* plexus is distributed to the inusdes and mucous membituie of the pharynx. The Superior lurynyeal nerve arises from the gaiigliform plexus of the pneumogastric, of which it appears to be almost a con- tinuation ; hence this plexus was named by Sir Astley Cooper the ganglion of the suj>erior laryngeal branch.'" The nerve descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the th3'ro-hyoidean mem- brane, through which it passes with the superior larjmgeal arterj', and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx and arytenoideus muscle. On the latter, and behind the cricoid cartilage, it communi- cates with the recurrent lar}'n- geal nerve. Behind the internal carotid it gives off the external * Origin and distribution of the eighth pair of nerves. 1, 3, 4. The medulla oblongata. 1. Is the cor- pus pyramidale of one side. 3.

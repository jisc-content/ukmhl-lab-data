278 DEEP CERVICAL FASCIA. of the omo-hyoid muscle, and may thence he traced behind the ckvicle, where it encloses the subclavius muscle, and, being extended from the cartilage of the first rib to the coracoid process, constitutes the costo- coracoid membrane. In front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the deep Fig. 113 * fascia is attached to the border of the lower jaw and os hyoides, and forms a distinct sheath for the submaxillary gland. Inferiorly it divides into two layers, one of which passes in front of the sternum, while the other is attached to its superior border. * A transverse section of the neck, shewing the deep cervical fascia and its numerous prolongations, forming sheaths for the different muscles. As the figure is symmetrical, the figures of reference 'are placed only on one side. 1. The platysma myoides. 2. The trapezius. 3. The ligamentum nuchas, from which the fascia may be traced forwards beneath the trapezius, enclosing the other muscles of the neck. 4. The point at which the fascia divides, to form a sheath for the stemo-mastoid muscle (5). 6. The point of reunion of the two layers of the stemo-mastoid sheath. 7. The point of union of the deep cervical fascia of opposite sides of the neck. 8. Section of the stemo-hyoid. 9. Omo-hyoid. 10. Sterno-thyroid. 11. The lateral lobe of the thyroid gland. 12. The trachea. 13. The (Esophagus. 14. The sheath containing the com- mon carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. 15. The longus coUi. The neiwe in front of the sheath of this muscle is the sympathetic. 16. The rectus anticus major. 17. Scalenus anticus. 18. Scalenus posticus. 19. The splenius capitis. 20. Splenius colli. 21.

The transverse processes are seen to be traversed by the vertebral arteiy and vein.

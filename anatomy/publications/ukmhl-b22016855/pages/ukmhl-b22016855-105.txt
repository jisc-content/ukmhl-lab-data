89 OS INNOMINATUM. ILIUM. ) Os INXOMINATUM.—The OS innominatura (os coxie) is an irregular, ) ■ flat bone, consisting in the young subject of three parts, which meet at * • the acetabiJuin. Hence it is usually described in the adult as divi- ^ ■ sible into three portions, ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the Fig. 39.* ■ superior, broad, and expanded portion which forms the prominence of !the hip, and articulates with the sacrum. The ischium is the inferior r and strong part of the bone on which we sit. The os pubis is that [•portion which forms the front of the pelvis, and gives support to the t external organs of generation. The ILIUM may be described as divisible into an internal and ex- I'temal surface, a crest, and an anterior and posterior border. The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, below by a pprominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by * The 08 innorainatum of the right side. 1.

OPTHALMIC NERVE. 443 The Frontal nerve mounts above the levator palpebrae, and runs forward, resting on that muscle, to the supra-orbital loramen, through which it escapes upon the forehead, with the supra-orbital artery. It supplies the conjunctiva and upper eyelid and the integument oi the cranium as far as the vertex. Fig. 149.* * A diagram, shewing the fifth pair of nerves with its branches. 1. The origin of the nerve by two roots. 2. The nerve escaping from the crus cere- belli. 3. The Gasserian ganglion. 4. Its ophthalmic division. 5. The frontal nerve giving off the supra-trochlear branch, and escaping on the forehead through the snpra-orbit^ foramen. 6. The lachrymal nerve. 7. The nasal nerve, passing at 8 through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, and giving off the infra-trochlear branch. 9. The communication of the nasal nerve with the ciliaiT ganglion. 10. A small portion of the third nerve with which the gan- glion is seen communicating; the ganglion gives oif the ciliary branches from its anterior aspect. 11. The superior maxillary nerve. 12. Its orbital branch. 13. The two branches communicating with Meckelâ€™s ganglion; the three branches given off from the lower part of the ganglion are the posterior palatine nerves. 14, 14. The superior dental nerves, posterior, middle, and anterior, forming by their communications the superior maxillary plexus. 15. The infra- orbital branches distributed upon the cheek. 16. The inferior maxillary nerve. 17. Its anterior or muscular trunk. 18. The posterior trunk; the two divisions are separated by an arrow. 19. The gustatory nerve. 20. The chorda tym- pani joining it at an acute angle. 21. The submaxillar)' ganglion. 22. The inferior dental nerve. 23. Its mylo-hyoidean branch. 24. The auricular nerve, dividing behind the articulation of the lower jaw, to reunite and fonn a single trunk. 25. Its branch of communication with the facial nerve. 26. Its tempo- ral branch.

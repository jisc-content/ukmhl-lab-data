INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 342 two sides of the body. The right common iliac is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed at its bifurcation by the ureter. It is in relation posteriorly with the two common iliac veins, and ex- ternally with the psoas magnus. The left is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed by the rectum and superior haemorrhoi- dal artery, and, at its bifurcation, by the ureter. It is in relation be- hind with the left common iliac vein, and externally with the psoas magnus. INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The Internal Iliac Artery is a short trunk, varying in length from an inch to two inches. It descends obliquely to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk. Fig. 128.* * The distribution and branches of the iliac arteries..# 1. The aorta. 2. The left common iliac artery. 3. The external iliac. 4. The epigastric artery. 5. The circumflexa ilii. 6. The internal iliac artery. 7. Its anterior trunk. 8. Its posterior trunk. 9. The umbilical artery giving off (10) the superior vesical artery. After the origin of this branch, the umbilical artery becomes converted into a fibrous cordâ€”the umbilical ligament. 11. The internal pudic artery passing behind the spine of the ischium (12) and lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament. 13. The middle hsemorrhoidal artery. 14. The ischiatic artery, also passing behind the anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament to escape from the pelvis. '15. Its inferior vesical branch. 16. The ilio-lumbar, the first branch of the posterior trunk (8) ascending to inosculate with the circumflexa ilii artery (5) and form an arch ^ong the crest of the ilium. 17. The obturator artery. 18. The lateral sacral. 19. The gluteal artery escaping from the pelvis through the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen. 20. The sacra media. 21. The right common iliac artery cut short. 22. The femoral artery.

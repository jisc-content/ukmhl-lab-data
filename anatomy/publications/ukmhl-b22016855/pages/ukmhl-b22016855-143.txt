127 LIGAMENTS OF THE RIBS. by its outer border with the external lateral ligament, and in front receives some fibres of insertion of the external pterygoid muscle. Occasionally it is incomplete in the centre. It divides the joint into two distinct cavities, the one being above and the other below the cartilage. The spwvial membranes are situated the one above, the other below the fibrous cartilage, the former being the larger of the two. When the fibrous cartilage is perforate, the synovial membranes communi- cate. Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete interarticular cartilage, and, consequently, with two syno- vial membranes ; they are, the stemo-elavicular articulation, the acro- mio-clavicular, and the articulation of the ulna with the cuneiform bone. The interarticular fibrous-cartilages of the knee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membiRne. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament with- out fibrous-cartilage.

In the movement of depression the interarticular cartilage glides for- * In this sketch a section has been carried through the joint, in order to shew the natural position of the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the manner in which it is adapted to the difference of form of the articulating surfaces. 1.

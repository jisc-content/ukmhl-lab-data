Behind. Bifurcation of the trachea. Great cardiac plexus. Cardiac nerves. Left recurrent nerve, Thoracic duct. Arch of the Aorta. Below. Cardiac ganglion, Bemains of ductus arteriosus. Left recun'ent nerve. Bight pulmonary artery, Left bronchus. The descending aorta is subdivided in correspondence with the two great cavities of the trunk, into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The Thoracic aorta is situated to the left side of the vertebral column, but approaches the middle line as it descends, and at the aortic opening of the diaphragm is altogether in front of the column. After entering the abdomen it again falls back to the left sidci Relations.—It is in relation, behind, with the vertebral column and lesser vena azygos; i«/rowf, with the oesophagus and right pneumo- gastric nerve; to the left side, with the pleura; and to the 7ight, with the thoracic duct.

Vertebral column. The Abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and descends, lying rather to the left side of the vertebral column, to the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the two common iliac arteries. Relations.—It is crossed in front, by the left renal vein, pancreas, transverse duodenum, and mesentery, and is embraced by the aortic plexus; behind it is in relation with the thoracic duct, receptaculum chyli, and left lumbar veins.

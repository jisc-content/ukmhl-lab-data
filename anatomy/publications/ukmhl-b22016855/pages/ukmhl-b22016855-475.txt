459 SPINA I. NERVKS. After the fonnation of a ganglion, the two roots unite, and consti- tute a spinal nerve, which escapes through the intervertebral foramen, and divides into an anterior branch for the supply of the front aspect of the body, and a posterior branch for the posterior aspect. In the first cervical and last two sacral nerves this division takes place with- Fig. 153.* in the dura mater and in the upper four sacral nerves externally to that cavity, but within the sacral canal. The anterior branches, with the exception of the first two cervical nerves, are larger than the poste- rior ; an arrangement which is proportioned to the larger extent of surface they are required to supply. The Spinal nerves are divided into— Cervical .... 8 pairs Dorsal . . . . 12 Lumbar .... 5 Sacral .... 6 The cervical nerves pass off transversely from the spinal cord ; the • Part of the cen'ical portion of the spinal cord, viewed on its posterior aspect: and shewing its membranes and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 1, 1.

The membrana dentata. 4. The nervus accessorius, as- cending between the posterior roots and the membrana dentata; on the opposite side this nerve has been removed. 6, 5. The dura mater or theca vertebralis, 6, 6. Openings in the dura mater for the passage of the roots of the nerves. 7, 7. The ganglia on|the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 8. The anterior roots of the spinal nerves. The posterior roots have been cut away in order to show each anterior root, proceeding to join the nerve beyond the ganglion.

27 FRONTAL BONE, tween the two internal angular processes, is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a projecting process, the nasal spine. Upon each orbital plate, immediately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which lodges the lachrymal gland; Fig. 15.* and beneath the internal angular process a small pit, sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle is attached. Internal Surface.—Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri and the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid bone, the foramen ccecum. This opening lodges a process of the dura mater, and occasionally gives passage to a small vein which communicates with the nasal veins. On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the glandulse Pacchioni, and on the orbital plates a number of irregular pits called digital fossae, which correspond with the convolutions of the anterior lobes of the • The external surface of the frontal bone. 1.

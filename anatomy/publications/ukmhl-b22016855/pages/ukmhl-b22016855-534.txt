518 INTERNAL EAR.—LABYRINTH. 3. In the Posterior wall are the— Opening of the mastoid cells, Pyramid, Opening for the stapedius, Opening for Jacobson’s nerve, Apertura chordae (entrance). 4. In the Anterior loall are the— Eustachian tube, Fissura Glaseri, Opening for the laxator tympani, Apertura chordae (exit). The tympanum is lined by a vascular mucous membrane, which in- vests the ossicula and chorda tympani, and forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani. From the tympanum it is reflected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout, and it passes through the Eustachian tube to become continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the tympanum are derived from the internal maxillary, internal carotid, and posterior auricular. Its Nerves are,—1. Minute branches from the facial, which are distributed to the stapedius muscle. 2. The chorda tympani, which leaves the facial nerve near the stylo-mastoid foramen, and arches 1 upwards to enter the tympanum at the root of the pyramid ; it then passes forwards between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to its proper opening in the fissura Glaseri. 3. The tym- panic branches of Jacobsori's nerve, which are distributed to the mem- branes of the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda, and to the Eusta- chian tube, and form a plexus by communicating with the carotid plexus, otic ganglion, and Vidian nerve. 4. A filament from the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. INTERNAL EAR. The Internal ear is called labyrinth, from the complexity of its com- munications ; it consists of a membranous and an osseous portion. The osseous labyrinth presents a series of cavities, which are channelled through the substance of the petrous bone, and is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the meatus auditorius intemus. It is ' divisible into the— i Vestibule, ^ Semicircular canals, i Cochlea. J •twavir

POSTERIOR TIBIAL REGION. 265 IMalions.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and with the anterior annular' ligament. By its posterior stirface ^^0-109.* with the interosseous membrane, the fibula, the tibia, the ankle-joint, the peroneus tertius are direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg; acting in conjunc- tion with the tibialis posticus they direct the foot inwards, and with the peroneus longus and brevis outwards. They assist also in preserving the flat- ness of the foot during progression. The extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis, are direct extensors of the phalanges; but, con- tinuing their action, they assist the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, in flexing the entire foot upon the leg. Taking their origin from below, they increase the stability of the ankle-joint. Dissection. — Make an incision from'the middle of the popliteal • The superficial 'muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg. 1. The biceps muscle, forming the outer hamstring. 2. The tendons forming the inner ham- string. 3. The popliteal space. 4. The gastrocnemius muscle. 5, 6. The soleus. 6. The tendo Achillis. 7. The posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. 8. The tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles passing behind the outer ankle. 9. The tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digito- rum passing into the foot behind the inner ankle. extensor brevis digitorum, and the bones and articulations of the great toe. It is crossed upon this aspect by the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its outer side with the extensor longus digitorum, and in the foot with the dorsalis pedis artery and veins ; the outer side of its tendon upon the dorsum of the foot being the guide to these vessels. By its inner side with the tibialis anticus, and with the ante- rior tibial vessels. Actions. — The tibialis anticus and Posterior Tibial Region. Superficial Group. Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, Soleus.

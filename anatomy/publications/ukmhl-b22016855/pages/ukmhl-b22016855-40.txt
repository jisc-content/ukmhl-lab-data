parietal bone. 24 interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.— By seven centres; four for the four parts of the ex- panded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the expanded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae; at birth the four remaining pieces are distinct; they are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphe- noid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs: to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis; to the superior curved line, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the transverse pro- cess, the rectus lateralis; and to the basilar process, the rectus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle constrictor muscles. Fig. 13.* Parietal Bone.—The parietal bone is situated at the side and vertex of the skull; it is quadrilateral in form, and divisible into an external and internal surface, four borders and four angles. The • The external surface of the left parietal bone. 1. The superior or sagittal border. 2. The inferior or squamous border. 3. The anterior or coronal bor- der. 4. The posterior or lambdoidal border. 5. The temporal ridge; the figure is situated immediately in front of the parietal eminence. 6. The parietal fora- men, unusually large in the bone from which this figure was drawn. 7. 'Iho anterior inferior angle. 8. The posterior inferior angle.

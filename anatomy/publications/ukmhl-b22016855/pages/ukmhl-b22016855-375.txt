POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 359 The Dorsalis hallucis runs forward upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, one of which passes inwards beneath the tendon of the extensor pro- prius pollicis, and is distributed to the inner border of the gi’eat toe, while the other bifurcates for the supply of the adjacent sides of the great and second toe. The Communicating artery passes into the sole of the foot between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the external plantar artery. Besides the preceding, numerous branches are distributed to the bones and articulations of the foot, particularly along the inner border of the latter. POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The posterior tibial artery passes obliquely downwards along the tibial side of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, where it divides into the internal and external plantar artery. Delations.—In its course downwards it lies first upon the tibialis posticus, next on the flexor longus digitorum, and then on the tibia ; it is covered in by the intermuscular fascia which separates it above from the soleus, and below from the deep fascia of the leg and the in- tegument. It is accompanied by its venae comites, and by the poste- rior tibial nen'e, which latter lies at first to its outer side, then super- ficially to it, and again to its outer side.

(Esophagus. EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The External carotid artery ascends nearly perpendicularly from op- posite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and the meatus auditorius, where it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary artery. Relations.—In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides muscles ; by the hypoglossal nerve near its origin ; higher up it is situated in the substance of the parotid gland, and is crossed by the facial nerve. Behind, it is separated from the internal carotid bj' the stylo-pharyn- geus and stylo-glossus muscles, glosso-pharjmgeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

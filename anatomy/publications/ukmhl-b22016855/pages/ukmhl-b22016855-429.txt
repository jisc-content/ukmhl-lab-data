The sulcus between this convolution and the corpus callosum has been termed, very improperly, the “ ventricle of the corpus callosum,” and some longitudinal fibres (striae longitudinales laterales), which are brought into view when the convolution is raised, were called by Reil the “■ covered band.” If, now, the upper part of each hemisphere be removed to a level with the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medulliiry matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey substance corre- sponding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemispheres, will be seen ; this is the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens.

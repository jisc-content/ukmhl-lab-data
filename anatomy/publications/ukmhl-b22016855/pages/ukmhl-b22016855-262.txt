•246 MUSCLES OP THE HAND, arises from the trapezium and annular ligament ; the internal portion from the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserU:d into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, liaving a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to protect the joint. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external portion of the palmar fascia. By its deep surface with the adductor pollicis, tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and trapezio-metacarpal articulation. * The muscles of the hand. 1. The annular ligament. 2, 2. The origin and insertion of the abductor pollicis muscle; the middle portion has been re- moved. 3. The flexor ossis metacarpi, or opponens pollicis. 4. One portio^ of the flexor brevis pollicis. 5. The deep portion of the flexor brevis pollicis. 6, The adductor pollicis. 7, 7. The lumbricales muscles, arising from the deep flexor tendons, upon which the numbers are placed. The tendons of the flexor sublimis have been removed from the pahn of the hand. 8. One of the tendons of the deep flexor, passing between the two terminal slips of the tendon of the flexor sublimis to reach the last phalanx. 9. The tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, passing between the two portions of the flexor brevis to the last phalanx. 10. The abductor minimi digiti. 11. The flexor brevis minimi digiti. The edge of the flexor ossis metacarpi, or adductor minimi di^ti, is seen projecting beyond the inner border of the flexor brevis. 12. The promi- nence of the pisiform bone. 13. The first dorsal interosseous muscle; Fig. 104.*

166 CRANIAL GROUP. 1. Cranial group.—Occipito-frontalis. Dissection.—occipito-frontalis is to be dissected by making a longitudinal incision along the vertex of the head, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the root of the nose ; and a second incision along the forehead and around the side of the head, to join the two extremities of the preceding. Dissect the integument and superficial fascia carefully outwards, beginning at the anterior angle of the flap, where the muscular fibres are thickest, and remove it altogether.

The orbicularis 's palpebrarum, which conceals the corrugator supercilii and tensor tarsi. 5. The ♦ pyramidalis nasi. 6. The compressor nasi. 7. The orbicularis oris. 8. The i levator labii superioris alasque nasi; the adjoining fasciculus between numbers ^ ! 8 and 9 is the labial portion of the muscle. 9.

137 LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. partial connections with the fibro-cartilaginous sinfaces of the two hones between which it is placed ; and it is not unfrequently absent. When partial, it occupies the upper part of the articulation. The synovial membranes are very delicate. There is, of course, hut one, when the fibro-cartilage is incomplete. Fig. 66.* Actions.—The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two move- ments—the gliding of the surfaces upon each other, and the rotation of the scapula upon the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are the Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament is a broad and thick triangular hand, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion process, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually interposed. • The ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1, The superior acromio- clavicular ligament. 2. The coraco-clavicular ligament; this aspect of the liga- ment is named trapezoid. 3. The coraco-acromial ligament. 4. The transverse ligament. 5. The capsular ligament. 6. The coraco-humeral ligament. 7. The long tendon of the biceps issuing from the capsular ligament, and entering the bicipital groove.

284 DEEP PERINEAL FASCIA. Tlie deep pcriveal fascia (Camper’s ligament, triangular ligament) is situated liehind the root of the penis, and is firmly stretched across between the ramus of the os pubis and ischium of each side, so as to con- stitute a strong septum of defence to the outlet of the pelvis. At its inferior border it divides into two layers, one of which is continued forwards, and is continuous with the superficial perineal fascia; while the other is prolonged backwards to the rectum, and, joining with the anal fascia, assists in supporting the extremity of that intestine. The deep perineal fascia is composed of two layers, which are separated from each other by several important parts, and traversed by the mem- branous portion of the urethra. The anterior layer is nearly plane in its direction, and sends a sheath forwards around the anterior termina- tion of the membranous urethra to be attached to the posterior part of Fiy. 115.* the bulb. The posterior layer is oblique and sends a funnel-shaped process backwards, which invests the commencement of the mem- branous urethra and the prostate gland. The inferior segment of this • The pubic arch with the attachments of the perineal fascias. 1, 1, 1. The superficial perineal fascia divided by a shaped incision into three flaps; the lateral flaps are turned over the ramus of the os pubis and ischium at each side, to which they are firmly attached; the posterior flap is continuous with the deep perineal fascia. 2. The deep perineal fascia. 3. The opening for the passage of the membranous portion of the urethra, previously to the entrance of the latter into the bulb. 4. Two projections of the anterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, corresponding with the position of Cowper’s glands.

PARIETAL BONE. 25 superior border is straight, to articulate with its fellow of the opposite Iside. The inferior border is arched and thin, to articulate with the temporal bone. The anterior border is concave, and the posterior somewhat convex. External Surface.—Crossing the bone in a longitudinal direction ■ from the anterior to the posterior border, is an arched line, the teTTir iij poral ridge, to which the temporal fascia is attached. In the middle .1 ■ of this line, and nearly in the centre of the bone, is the projection i called the parietal eminence, which marks the centre of ossification, i Above the temporal ridge the surface is rough, and covered by the jl’ aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis ; below the ridge the bone is ii; smooth {planum semicirculare), for the attachment of the fleshy fibres ij of the temporal muscle. Near the superior border of the bone, and at tj about one-third from its posterior extremity, is the parietal foramen, Ij which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This fora- i' men is often absent. Fig. 14 * Internal Surface.—The internal table is smooth ; it is marked by numerous furrows, which lodge the ramifications of the arteria menin- gea media, and by digital fossm which correspond with the convolutions of the brain. Along the upper border is part of a shallow groove, • The internal surface of the left parietal bone. 1. The superior or sagittal border. 2. Tlie inferior, or squamous border. 3.

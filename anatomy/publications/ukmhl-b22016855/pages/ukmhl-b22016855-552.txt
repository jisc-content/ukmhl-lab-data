The fibrous layer is attached, above, to the great vessels at the root of the heart, where it is continuous with the thoracic fascia; and below, to the tendinous portion of the diaphragm. The serous membrane invests the heart with the commencement of its great vessels, and is then reflected upon the internal surface of the fibrous layer. The Heart is placed obliquely in the chest, the base being directed upwards and backwards towards the right shoulder; the apex for- wards |nd to the left, pointing to the space between the fifth and sixth ribs, at about two or three inches from the sternum. Its under side is Fig. 170.» flattened, and rests upon the tendinous portion of the diaphragm; its upper side is rounded and convex, and formed principally by the right ventricle, and partly by the left. Surmounting the ventricles are the * The anatomy of the heart. 1. The right auricle. 2. The entrance of the superior vena cava. 3. The entrance of the inferior cava. 4. The opening of the coronary vein, half closed by the coronary valve. 5. The Eustachian valve. 6. The fossa ovalis, surrounded by the annulus ovalis. 7. The tuberculum Loweri. 8.

The tricuspid valve, attached by the chordas tendineae to the cameas columnae (12). 13. The pulmonary artery, guarded at its commencement by three semilunar valves. 14.

Fiy. 107.* These two muscles must be dis- sected from the tuberosity of the ischium, to bring into view the origin of the next. The Semi-membranosus, re- markable for the tendinous expan- sion upon its anterior and posterior surface, arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the com- mon origin of the two preceding muscles. It is inserted into the posterior part of the inner tubero- sity of the tibia; at its insertion the tendon splits into three portions, one of which is inserted in a groove on the inner side of the head of the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The second is continuous with an aponeurotic expansion that binds down the popliteus muscle, the popliteal fascia; and the third turns upwards and outwards to the external condyle of the femur, forming the middle portion of the posterior ligament of the knee- joint (ligamentum posticum Wins- lowii). The tendons of the last two muscles, viz. the semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus, with those of the gracilis and sartorius, form the inner hamstring.

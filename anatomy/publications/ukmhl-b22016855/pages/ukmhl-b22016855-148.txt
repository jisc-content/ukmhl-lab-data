Fig. 63.* LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. 132 side of the sacrum and coccyx, interlacing its fibres with the greater sacro-ischiatic ligament. The anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the coccygeus muscle, and behind with the posterior ligament; Avith which its fibres are intermingled. By its upper border it forms a part of the lower boundary of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and by the lower a part of the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. The 'posterior or greater sacro-ischiatio ligament, considerably larger, thicker, and more posterior than the preceding, is narrower in the middle than at each extremity. It is attached, by its smaller end, to the inner margin of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium, Avhere it forms a falciform process, which protects the internal pudic artery, and is continuous with the obturator fascia. By its larger extremity it is inserted into the side of the coccyx, sacrum, and posterior inferior spine of the ilium. The posterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the anterior ligament, and behind Avith the gluteus maximus, to some of the fibres of which it gives origin. By its superior border it forms * The ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint. 1. The loAver part of the ante- rior common ligament of the vertebras, extending dovmwards over the front of the sacrum. " 2. The lumbo-sacral ligament. 3. The lumbo-iliac ligament. 4. The anterior sacro-iliac ligaments. 5. The obturator membrane. 6. Poupart’s ligament. 7. Gimbernat’s ligament. 8. The capsular ligament of the hip-joint. 9. The ilio-femoral or accessory ligament.

514 TYMPANUM. MIDDLE EAR OR TYMPANUM. The tympanum is an irregular bony cavitjâ€™', compressed from without j inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is bounded, exter- nally, by the meatus and membrana tympani; internally, by the base of , the petrous bone; behind, by the mastoid cells ; and, throughout the I rest of its circumference, by the thin osseous layer which connects the petrous with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. i The Membrana tympani is a thin and semi-transparent membrane | of an oval shape, its long diameter being vertical. It is inserted * A diagi'am of the ear. p. The pinna, t. The tjTnpanum. /. The labyrinth. 1. The upper part of the helix. 2. The antihelix. 3. The tragus. 4. The antitragus. 5.

The three little bones, crossing the area of the tympanum, malleus, incus, and stapes; the foot of the stapes blocks up the fenestra ovalis upon the inner wall of the tympanum. 11. The promontory. 12. The fenestra rotunda; the dark opening above the ossicula leads into the mastoid cells. 13. The Eus- ! tachian tube; the little canal upon this tube contains the tensor tympani mus- cle in its passage to the tympanum. 14. The vestibule. 15. The three semi- ! circular Canals, horizontal, perpendicular, and oblique. 16. The ampullae upon the perpendicular and horizontal canals. 17. The cochlea. 18. A depression between the convexities of the two tubuli which communicate with the tympa- num and vestibule ; the one is the scala tympani, terminating at 12; the other is the scala vestibuli.

Articulation of ilie vertebral Column.—The ligaments connecting together the different pieces of the vertebral column, admit of the same arrangement as that of the vertebrae themselves.

Of the transverse processes,— Bodies.—The Anterior common ligament is a broad and riband- like band of ligamentous fibres, extending along the front surface of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the intervertebral substance, and less closely with the bodies of the vertebrae. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lumbar, and consists of a median and two lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of Fig. 62.♦ * The anterior ligafnonts of the vertebrse, and ligaments of the ribs. 1.

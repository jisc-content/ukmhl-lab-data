OCCIPITAL BONE. 23 the lambdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, hut not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by means of the additamentiun suturm lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and the side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of Fig. 12 * the temporal bone, and the intermediate space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or fora- men lacerum postcrius. The angles of the occipital bone are the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is called the posterior fontaneUc. The inferior angle is the articular extremity of the basilar process. The lateral angles at each side project into that â€¢ The internal surface of the occipital hone. 1. The left cerebral fossa. 2. The left cerebellar fossa. 8. The groove for the posterior part of the superior longitudinal sinus. 4. The spine for the falx corebelli, and groove for the occipital sinuses. 5. The groove for the left lateral sinus. 6. The internal occipital protuberance, the groove on which lodges the torcular Herophili. 7. The foramen magnum. 8. The basilar process, grooved for the medulla oblongata. 9. The termination of the groove for the lateral sinus, bounded externally by the jugular eminence. 10. The jugular fossa ; this fossa is com- pleted by the petrous portion of the temporal bono. 11. The superior border. 12. The inferior border. 18. The border which articulates with the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and which is grooved by the inferior petrosal sinus. 14. The anterior condyloid foramen.

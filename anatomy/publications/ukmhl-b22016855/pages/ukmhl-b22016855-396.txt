The External iliac vein lies to the inner side of the correspond- ing artery at the os pubis; but gradually gets behind it as it passes upwards along the brim of the pelvis, and it terminates opposite the sacro-iliac sym- physis by uniting with the in- ternal iliac, to form the common iliac vein. Immediately above Poupartâ€™s ligament it receives the epigastric and circumflexa ilii veins; it has no valves. The Internal iliac vein is formed by vessels Avhich cor- respond with the branches of the internal iliac artery; it re- ceives the returning blood from the gluteal, ischiatic, internal pudic, and obturator veins, ex- ternally to the pelvis ; and from the vesical and uterine plexuses within the pelvis. The vein lies to the inner side of the in- ternal iliac artery, and termi- nates by uniting with the ex- ternal iliac vein, to form the common iliac. The Vesical and prostatic plexus is an important plexus of veins which surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland, and receives its blood from the great dorsal vein of the penis, and from the veins of the external organs of generation. It is retained in connection Muth the sides of the bladder by a reflexion of the pelvic fascia.

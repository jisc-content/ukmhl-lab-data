CILIARY PROCESSES. THIRD TUNIC. 503 Tlie ciliarj' processes consist of a number of triangular folds, formed apparently by the plaiting of the middle and internal layer of the choroid. According to Zinn, they are about sixty in number, and may be divided into large and small, the latter being situated in the spaces between the former. Their periphery is connected with the ciliarj' ligament, and is continuous with the middle and internal layer of the choroid. The central border is free, and rests against the cir- cumference of the lens. The anterior surface corresponds with the r K I t uvea; the posterior receives the folds of the zonula ciliaris between its processes, and thus establishes a connection between the choroid and the third tunic of the eye. The cibary processes are covered with a thick layer of pigmentum nigrum, which is more abundant upon them, and upon the anterior part of the choroid, than upon the poste- rior part. When the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish coloim. Third tunic.—The third tunic of the eye is the retina, which is 0 prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. \ Dissection.—If, after the preceding dissection, the choroid membrane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina may be seen very distinctly. * The anterior segment of a transverse section of the globe of the eye, seen from within. 1.

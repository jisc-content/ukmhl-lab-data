â€¢219 DIAPHRAGM. * The under or abdominal side of the diaphragm. 1. 2. 3. The greater mus- cle; the figure 1 rests upon the central leafiet of the tendinous centre; the number 2 on tlie left or smallest leaflet: and number 3 on the right leaflet. 4. The thin fasciculus which arises from the ensiform cartilage; a small trian- gular space, which is closed only by the serous membranes of the abdomen and chest, is left on either side of this fasciculus. 5. The ligamentum arcuatum externum of the left side. 6. The ligamentum arcuatum internum. 7. A small arched opening occasionally found, through which the lesser splanchnic nerve passes. 8. The right or larger tendon of the lesser muscle; a muscular fasciculus from this tendon curves to the left side of the gi-eater muscle between the oesophageal and aortic openings. 9. The fourth lumbar vertebra. 10. The left or shorter tendon of the lesser muscle. 11. The aortic opening occupied by the aorta, which is cut short off. 12. A portion of the oesophagus issuing through the oesophageal opening; in this figure the oesophageal opening is tendinous at its anterior part, an occurrence which is not uncommon. 13. The opening for the inferior vena cava, in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm. 14. The psoas magnus muscle passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum inter- num ; it hiiH been removed on the opposite side to shew the arch more distinctly. 16. The (juadratus lumborum passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum exter- num ; this muscle has also been removed on the left side. i with the tendon of the lesser muscle opposite the body of the i second. ; The tendinous centre of the diaphragm is shaped like a trefoil leaf, j of which the central leaflet points to the ensiform cartilage, and is the largest ; the Intend leaflets, right and left, occupy the corresponding Fig. 96 *

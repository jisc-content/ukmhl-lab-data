EYEBROWS. EYELIDS. oon APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. The Appendages of the Eye {tutamina ocidi) are, the eyehrows, eye- lids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, caruncula lachrymalis, and the lachrymal apparatus. The Eyebrows {supercilia') are two projecting arches of integument covered with short thick hairs, which form the upper boundary of the orbits. They are connected beneath with the orbiculares, occipito- frontales, and corrugatores superciliorum muscles ; their use is to shade the eyes from too vivid a light, or protect them from particles of dust and moisture floating over the forehead. The Eyelids {palpehrce) are two valvular layers placed in front of the eye, serving to defend it from injury by their closure. When drawn open, they leave between them an elliptical space, the angles of j which are called canthi. The outer canthus is formed by the meeting i of the two lids at an acute angle. The inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance inwards towards the nose, and a triangular space is left between the lids in this situation, which is called the kicus lachry- malis. At the commencement of the lacus lachrj'malis upon each of the two lids is a small angular projection, the lachrymal papilla or Fig. 162.* * The appendages of the eye. 1. The superior tarsal cartilage. 2. The lower border of the cartilage on which are seen the openings of the Meibomian glands. 3. Tlie inferior tarsal cartilage; along the upper border of this car- tilage the openings of the Meibomian glands are likewise seen. 4. The lachry- mal gland ; its superior or orbital portion. 5. Its inferior or palpebral portion. 6. The lacluymal ducts. 7. The plica semilunaris. 8. The caruncula lachry- malis. 9. The puncta lachrymalia of the lachrymal canals. 10. The superior lachrymal canal. 11. The inferior lachrymal canal. 12. The lachrymal 14. The dilatation of the nasal duct, where it opens into the inferior meatus of the nose. 15. The nasal duct.

This cartilage is sometimes pierced through its centre, and not unfrequently deficient, to a greater or less extent, at its lower part. Fig. 65.* 2. Scapvlo-clavieular Atiictdation.â€”The ligaments of the scapular end of the clavicle are, the Superior acromio-clavicular, Inferior acromio-clavicular, Coraco-clavicular (trapezoid and conoid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes. The superior acromio-clavieidar ligament is a. moderately thick plane of superimposed fibres passing between the extremity of the clavicle and the acromion, upon the upper surfece of the joint. The inferior acromio-clavicular ligament is a thin plane situated upon the under surface. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a complete capsule around the joint. The coraco-clavicular ligament (trapezoid, conoid) is a thick fasci- culus of ligamentous fibres, passing obliquely between the base of the coracoid process and the under surface of the clavicle, and holding the end of the clavicle in firm connection with the scapula. When seen from before, it has a quadrilateral form ; hence it is named trapezoid: and, examined from behind, it has a triangular form, the base being upwards ; hence another name, conoid. The interarticular fhro-cartilage is often indistinct, from having * The ligaments of the stemo-clavicular and costo-stemal articulations. 1. The anterior stemo-clavicular ligament. 2.

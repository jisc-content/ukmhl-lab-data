THE ANATOMIST’S VADE MECUAL CHAPTER I. OSTEOLOGY. The bones are the organs of support to the animal frame; they give firmness and strength to the entire fabric, afford points of con- nection to the numerous muscles, and bestow individual character upon the body. In the limbs they are hollow cylinders, admirably calculated by their conformation and structure to resist violence and support weight. In the trunk and head, they are flattened and arched, to protect cavities and provide an extensive surface for attachment. In some situations they present projections of variable length, which serve as levers; and in others are grooved into smooth surfaces, which act as pulleys for the passage of tendons. Moreover, besides suppl}'- ing strength and solidity, they are equally adapted, by their numerous divisions and mutual apposition, to fulfil every movement which may tend to the preservation of the creature, or be conducive to his welfare. According to the latest analysis by Berzelius, bone is composed of about one-third of animal substance, which is almost completely redu- cible to gelatine by boiling, and of two-thirds of earthy and alkaline salts. The special constituents of bone are present in the following proportions;— Cartilage 32‘17 parts. Blood-vessels . . . . 1-13 Phosphate of lime . . . . 51 ’04 Carbonate of lime . . . 11 '30 Fluate of lime .... 2*00 Phosphiite of magnesia . , 1 • 16 Soda, chloride of sodium . . P20 100-00 B

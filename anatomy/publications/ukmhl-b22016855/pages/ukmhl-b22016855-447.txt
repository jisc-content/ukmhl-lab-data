431 diverging fibres. collateral facts, among the most prominent of which is the great vascu- larity of the grey substance; and the larger proportion of the nutrient fluid circulating through it is fully capable of effecting the increased growth and nutrition of the structures by which it is surrounded. Fig. 145.* ♦ The base of the brain, upon which several sections have been made, shew- ing the distribution of the diverging fibres. 1. The medulla oblongata. 2. One half of the pons Varolil. 3. The crus cerebri crossed by the optic nerve (4), and spreading out into the hemisphere to form the corona radiata. 5. The optic nerve near its origin; the nerves about the crus cerebri and cerebelli are the same as in the preceding figure. 6. The olfactory neive. 7. The corpora albicantia. On the right side a portion of the brain has been removed to shew the distribution of the diverging fibres. 8. The fibres of the corpus p)rramidale passing through the substance of the pons Varolii. 9. The fibres passing through the thalamus opticus. 10. The fibres passing through the cori)us striatum. 11. Their distribution to the hemisphere. 12. The fifth nerve: its two roots may be traced, the one forwards to the fibres of the corpus pyrami- dale, the other backwards to the fasciculi teretes. 13. The fibres of the corpus '■ pyramidale which pass outwards with the corpus restiforme into the substance of the cerebellum ; these are the arciform fibres of SoUy. The fibres referred to are those below the numeral, the numeral itself rests upon the corpus olivare. 14. A section through one of the hemispheres of the cerebellum, shewing the corpus rhomboideum in the centre of its white substance; the arbor vitse is also seen. 15. The opposite hemisphere of the cerebellum.

28 FRONTAL BONE. cerebrum. The superior border is thick and strongly serrated, bevel- led at the expense of the internal table in the middle, where it rests upon the junction of the two parietal, and at the expense of the exter- nal table on each side where it receives the lateral pressure of those Fig. 16.* bones. The inferior border is thin, irregular, and squamous, and articulates with the sphenoid bone. Development.â€”By two centres, one for each lateral half. Ossifica- tion begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life. The frontal sinuses make their appearance during the first year, and increase in size until old age. * The internal surface of the frontal bone; the bone is raised in such a man- ner as to show the orbito-nasal portion. 1. The grooved ridge for the lodg- ment of the superior longitudinal sinus and attachment of the falx. 2. The foramen caecum. 3. The superior or coronal border of the bone ; the figure is situated near that part which is bevelled at the expense of the internal table. 4. The inferior border of the bone. 5. The orbital plate of the left side. 6. The cellular border of the ethmoidal fissure. The foramen caecum (2) is seen through the ethmoidal fissure. 7. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal fora- mina; the anterior is seen leading into its canal. 8. The nasal spine. 9. The depression within the external angular process (12) for the lachrymal gland. 10. The depression for tho pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye; immediately to the left of this number is the supra-orbital notch, and to its right the internal angular process. 11. The opening leading into the frontal sinuses; tho leading line crosses the internal angular process. 12. The external angular process. The corresponding parts are seen on tho other side of the figure.

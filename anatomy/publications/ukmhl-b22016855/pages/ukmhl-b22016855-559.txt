543 LEFT VENTRICLE. Left Ventricle.—The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculonim, and continu- ing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. Fig. 172 ♦ The left ventricle is conical, both in external figure and in the form of its internal cavity. It forms the apex of the heart, by projecting beyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the ad- vantage in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven lines in thickness, those of the right ventricle being about two lines and a half. It presents for examination, in its interior, two openings, two valves, and the tendinous cords and muscular columns ; they may be thus arranged;— * The anatomy of the heart; the organ is viewed on its left side. 1. The cavity of the left auricle. The number is placed on that portion of the septum anricularum corresponding with the centre of the fossa ovalis. 2. The cavity of the appendix auriculse, near the apex of which are seen the musculi pectinati. 3. The opening of the two right pulmonary veins. 4. The sinus, into which the left pulmonary veins open. 5. The left pulmonary veins. 6. The auriculo-ven- tricular opening. 7. The coronary vein, lying in the auriculo-ventricular groove. 8. The left ventricle. 9, 9. The cavity of the left ventricle ; the numbers rest on the septum ventriculonim. a. The mitral valve; its flaps are connected by chord® tendine® to b, b. The column® came®, c, c. Fixed column® came®, forming part of the internal surface of the ventricle, d. The arch of the aorta, from the summit of which the three arterial trunks of the head and upper ex- tremities are seen arising, e. The pulmonary artery. /. The obliterated duc- tus arteriosus; the letter is placed in the cleft formed by the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, g. The left pulmonary arteiy. h. The right ventricle, -t. The point of the appendix of the right auricle.

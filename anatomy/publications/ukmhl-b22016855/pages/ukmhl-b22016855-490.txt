It pierces the posterior fibres of the psoas muscle; and crossing the iliacus obliquely, lying upon ^ the iliac fascia, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, passes into the thigh beneath Poupartâ€™s ligament. It then pierces the fascia lata at about two inches below the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The "posterior hranch crosses the tensor vaginal femoris muscle to the outer and posterior side of the * A diagram shewing the lumbar and sacral plexuses, with the nen-es of the lower extremity. 1. ihe five lumbar nerves; which, with a branch from the last dorsal, constitute the lumbar plexus. 2.

450 FACIAL NERVE. The Temporo-facial gives off a nuraljer of branches which are distri- buted over the temple and upper half of the face, supplying the [mus- cles of this region, and communicating with the branches of the auri- cular, the subcutaneus malae, and the supra-orbital nerve. The inferior branches, which accompany Stenon's duct, form a plexus with the terminal branches of the infra-orbital nerve. Fig. 150 t * The distribution of the facial nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus. i 1. The facial nerve, escaping from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and crossing the . | ramus of the lower jaw; the parotid gland has been removed in order to see the 1 nerve more distinctly. 2. The posterior auricular branch; the digastric and * stylo-hyoid filaments are seen near the origin of this branch. 3. Temporal 1 branches, communicating with (4' the branches of the frontal nerve. 5. Facial branches, communicating with (6) the infra-orbital nerve. 7. Facial branches, ) communicating with (8) the mental nerve. 9. Cervico-facial branches com- municating with (10) the superficialis colli nerve, and forming a plexus (III over the submaxillary gland. The distribution of the branches of the facial in a radiated direction over the side of the face and their looped communications constitute the pes anserinus. 12. The auiicularis magnus nerve, one of the ascending branches of the cervical plexus. 13. The occipitalis minor, ascend- ing along the posterior border of the stemo-mastoid muscle. 14. The super- ficial and deep descending branches of the cervical plexus. 15. The spinal accessory nerve, giving off a branch to the e.xtenial surface of the trapezius muscle. 16. The occipitalis major nerve, the posterior branch of the second cervical nerve.

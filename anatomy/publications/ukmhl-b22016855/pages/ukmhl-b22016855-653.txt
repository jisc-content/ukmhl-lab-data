DESCENT OF THE TESTIS, G37 While situated in the lumbar region, the testis and gubemaculum are placed behind the peritoneum, by which they are invested upon their anterior surface and sides. As they descend, the investing peri- toneum is carried downwards with the testis into the scrotum, forming a lengthened pouch, which by its upper extremity opens into the cavity of the peritoneum. The upper part of this pouch, being compressed by the spermatic canal, is gradually obliterated, the obliteration extending downwards along the spermatic cord nearly to the testis. That portion of the peritoneum which immediately surrounds the testis is, by the above process, cut off from its continuity with the peritoneum, and is termed the tunica vaginalis ; and as this membrane must be obviously Fig. 199.* Fig. 200. t a shut sac, one portion of it investing the testis, and the other being reflected so as to form a loose bag around it, its two portions have re- ceived the appellations of tunica vaginalis propria, and tunica vaginalis reflexa. The descent of the testis is effected by means of the traction of the muscle of the gubemaculum (cremaster). “ The fibres,” writes Mr. Curling, J “ proceeding from Poupart’s ligament and the obliquus in- * A diagram illustrating the descent of the testis. 1.

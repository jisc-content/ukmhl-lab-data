CRANIAL GANGLIA OF THE SYMPATHETIC, 485 * The cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerve. 1. The ganglion of Hibes. 2. Tlie filament by which it communicates with the carotid plexus (3). 4. The ciliary or lenticular ganglion, giving off ciliary branches for the supply of the globe of the eye. 5. Part of the inferior division of the third nerve communi- cating with the ganglion by means of a short thick branch (the short root). 6. Part of the nasal nerve, connected w'ith the ganglion by means of a longer branch (the long root). 7. A slender filament (the sympathetic root) sent di- rectly backwards from the ganglion to the carotid plexus. 8. Part of the sixth nen-e in the cavernous sinus, receiving two branches from the carotid plexus. 9. Meckel’s ganglion (spheno-palatine). 10. Its ascending branches, communi- cating with the superior maxillary nerve. II. Its descending or palatine branches. 12. Its internal branches, spheno-palatine or nasal. 13. The naso- palatine branch, one of the nasal branches. • The naso-palatine ganglion. 14. The posterior branch of the ganglion, the Vidian nerve. 15, Its carotid branch (n. petrosus profundus) communicating with the carotid plexus. 16. Its petrosal branch (n. petrosus superficialis minor), joining the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. 17. The facial nerve. 18. The chorda tym- pani nerve, which descends to join the gustatory nerve. 19. The gustatory • nerve. 20. The submaxillary ganglion, receiving the chorda tympani, and ••Other filaments from the gustatory. 21. The superior ceivical ganglion of the sympathetic. ganglia of the sympathetic. Thi.s ganglion, though of very small size, is interesting, as being the superior point of union between the sympa- thetic chains of opposite sides of the body. The Ciliary ganglion {lenticular) is a small quadrangular and flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve Fig. 156.*

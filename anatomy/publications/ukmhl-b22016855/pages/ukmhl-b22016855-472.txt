456 SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. Spinal accessory nerve.—The spinal accessory nerve arises by several filaments from the side of the spinal cord as low down as the fourth or fifth cervical nerve, and ascends behind the ligamentum den- ticulatum, and between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal Fig. 152.* * The anatomy of' the side of the neck, shewing the nerves of the tongue. 1. A fragment of the temporal bone containing the meatus auditorius extemus, mastoid, and styloid process. 2. The stylo-hyoid muscle. 3. The stylo-glossus. 4. The stylo-pharyngeus. 5. The tongue. 6, 18. The hyo-glossus muscle; its two portions. 7. The genio-hyo-glossus muscle. 8.' The genio-hyoideus. They both arise from the inner surface of the symphysis of thp lower jaw. 9. The sterno-hyoid muscle. 10. The stemo-thyroid. 11. The thyro-hyoid, upon which the th}TO-hyoidean branch of the hypoglossal nerve is seen ramifying. 12. The omo-hyoid crossing the common carotid artery (13), and internal jugular vein (14). 15. The external carotid giving oif its branches. 16. The internal caro- tid. 17. The gustatory nerve giving off a branch to the submaxiUaiy ganglion (18), and communicating a little further on with the hypoglossal nerve. 19. The submaxillary, or Wharton’s duct, passing forwards to the sublingual gland. The submaxillary ganglion is the small round body between numbers 18 and 19. 20. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve, passing in behind the hyo-glossus muscle. 21. The h)rpoglossal nerve curving around the occipital artery. 22. The descendens noni nerve, forming a loop with (23) the communicans noni, which is seen to be arising by filaments from the upper cervical nerves. 24. The pneumogastric nerve, emerging from between the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery, and entering the chest. 25. The facial nerve, emerging from the stylo- mastoid foramen, and crossing the external carotid artery.

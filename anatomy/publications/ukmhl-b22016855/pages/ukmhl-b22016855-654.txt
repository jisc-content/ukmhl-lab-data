DESCENT OP THE TESTIS. 638 ternus, tend to guide tlie gland into the inguinal canal; those attached ' to the 08 pubis, to draw it below the abdominal ring; and the pro- cess descending to the scrotum, to direct it to its final destination.” During the descent, “the muscle of the testis is gradually everted, until, when the transition is completed, it forms a muscular envelope external to the process of peritoneum, which surrounds the gland and the front of the cord.” “ The mass composing the central part of the gubernaculum, which is so soft, lax, and yielding as in every way to facilitate these changes, becomes gradually diffused, and, after the .mrival of the testicle in the scrotum, contributes to form the loose cellular tissue which afterwards exists so abundantly in this part.” The attachment of the gubernaculum to the bpttom of the scrotum is indicated throughout life by distinct traces.

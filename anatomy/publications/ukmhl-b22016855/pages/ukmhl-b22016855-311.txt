The thoracic portion of the descending aorta. 4. The arteria innominata, dividing into, 5, the right carotid; which again divides at 6, into the external and internal carotid; and 7, the right subclavian artery. 8. The axillary ar- tery ; its extent is designated by a dotted line. 9. The brachial artery. 10. The right pneumogastric nerve running by the side of the common carotid, in front of the right subclavian arteiy, and behind the root of the right lung. 11. The left common carotid, having to its outer side the left pneumogastric nerve, which crosses the arch of the aorta, and as it reaches its lower border is seen to give off the left recurrent nerve. 12. The left subclavian artery becoming axil- lary and brachial in its course, like the artery of the opposite side. 13. The trunk of the pulmonary artery coimected to the concavity of the arch of the aorta by a fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus arteriosus. 14. The left pul- monary artery. 15. The right pulmonary artery. 16. The trachea. 17. The right bronchus. 18. The left bronchus. 19,19. The pulmonary veins. 17, 15, and 19, on the right side, and 14,18, and 19, on the left, constitute the roots of the corresponding lungs, and the relative position of these vessels is preserved. 20. Bronchial arteries. 21, 21. Intercostal arteries; the branches from the front of 'the aorta above and below the number 3 are pericardiac and (esophageal branches.

and nerves, and in certain situations the lamellae separate from each other, and leave between them areolar spaces (cancelli) of various magnitude. The lamellae have an average diameter of of an inch, and, besides constituting the general structure of the basis sub- stance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about of an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameters of the canals have a medium average of of an inch. The cancelli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are composed of lamellae; and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be com- pared to an Haversian canal of which the medullary cavity is the mag- nified channel; and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the â€¢ Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg. Magnified 300 diameters. 1. One of the Haversian canais surrounded by its concentric lamelise. The corpuscles are seen between the lamollffl; but the calcigerouB tubuli are omitted. 2. An Haversian canal with its concentric lamellffi, Purklnjoan corpuscles, and tubuli. 3. The area of one of the canals. 4, 4. Direction of the lamellffl of the great medullary canal. Between the lamellae at the upper part of the figure, several very long corpuscles witli their tubuli are seen. In the lower part of the figure, the outlines of throe other canals are given, in order to show their form and mode of arrangement in the entire bone.

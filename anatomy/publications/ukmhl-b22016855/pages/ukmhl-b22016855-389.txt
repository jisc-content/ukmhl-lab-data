These structures are separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the tubular lining membrane. The cerebral veins from the under surface of the anterior lobes open into the cavernous sinuses. Thej’" communicate by means of the ophthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the cavernous sinuses backwards along the lower border of the petrous portion of the Fig. 135.* temporal bone at each side of the base of the skull, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the . commencement of the internal jugular veins. • The sinuses of the base of the skull. 1.

532 STRUCTURE OF HAIRS. the follicle in which the hair is enclosed, and the evolution the shaft of the hair. Hairs vary much in size and length in different parts of the body ; in some they are so short as not to appear beyond the follicle ; in others they grow to a great length, as on the scalp ; while along tlie margins of the eyelids and in the whiskers and beard, they are re- markable for their thickness. Hairs are generally more or less flatten- ed in form, and when the extremity of a transverse section is examined, it is found to possess an elliptical or reniform outline. This examina- tion also demonstrates that the centre of the hair is porous and loose in texture, while its periphery is dense ; thus affording ground for its division into a cortical and a medullary portion. The free extremit}' of a hair is generally pointed, and sometimes split into two or three filaments. Its attached extremity is implanted deeply in the integu- ment extending through the derma into the sub-cutaneous areolar tissue, * The anatomy of the skin. 1. The epiderma. 2. The rete mucosum or deep layer of the epidenna. 3. Two of the quadrilateral papillaiy clumps, such as are seen in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot; they are composed of minute conical papUlae. 4. The deep layer of the derma, the corium. 5. Adi- pose cells. 6. A sudoriparous gland with its spiral duct, such as is seen in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot. 7. Another sudoriparous gland with a straighter duct, such as is seen in the scalp. 8. Two hairs from the scalp, en- closed in their follicles; their relative depth in the skin is preserved. 9. A pair of sebiparous gl^ds, opening by short ducts into the follicle of the hair.

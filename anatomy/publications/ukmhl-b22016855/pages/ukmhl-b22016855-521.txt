These processes are arranged in the form of rays around the lens, and the spaces between them ai’C stained by the pigmentum nigrum of the ciliary processes. They derive their vessels from the vascular layer of the retina. The under surface of the zonula is in contact with the hyaloid membrane, and around the lens forms the anterior fluted wall of the canal of Petit. Fig. 161.* The connection between these folds and the ciliary processes may be very easily demonstrated by dividing an eye transversely into two portions, then raising the anterior half, and allowing the vitreous humour to separate from its attachment by its own weight. The folds of the zonula will then be seen to be drawn out from between the folds of the ciliary processes. Humours.—The Aqueous humour is situated in the anterior and 'posterior chambers of the eye; it is a weakly albuminous fluid, having in alkaline reaction, and a specific gravity very little greater than that . <f distilled water. According to Petit, it scai’cely exceeds four or five •puins in weight. The anterior chamler- is the space intervening between the cornea n front, and the iris and pupil behind.

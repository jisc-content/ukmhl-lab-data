178 AURICULAR GROUP. the masseter in appearance and direction, and was named by Winslow the internal masseter. ReLutions.—By its external surface with the external pterygoid, the interior maxillary nerve and its branches, the internal maxillary artery and branches, the internal lateral ligament, and the ramus of the lower jaw. By its internal surface with the tensor palati, superior con- strictor and fascia of the pharynx ; and by its posterior border with the parotid gland. Fig. 86.» Actions.—The maxillary muscles are the active agents in mastica- tion, and form an apparatus beautifully fitted for that office. The buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of the tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connection with the superior constrictor, it shortens the cavity of the pharjTix, from before backwards, and becomes an im- portant auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal pterygoid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterj'goid in grinding the food by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the upper; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temporal. The whole of these muscles, acting in succession, pro- duce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the_upper, effects the proper mastication of the food. 8.

322 AXILLARY ARTERY Fig. 122.* * The axillary and brachial artery, with their branches. 1. The deltoid j muscle. 2. The biceps. 3. The tendinous process given off from the tendon of the biceps, to the deep fascia of the fore-arm. It is this process which sepa- 'j rates the median basilic veiri from the brachial artery. 4. The outer border of j the brachialis anticus muscle. 5. The supinator longus. 6. The coraco-bra- ;g chialis. 7. The middle portion of the triceps muscle. 8. Its inner head. 9. '4 The axillary artery. 10. The brachial artery;â€”a dark line marks the Umit H between these two vessels. 11. The thoracica acromialis artery dividing into its three branches: the number rests upon the coracoid process. 12. The superior and inferior thoracic arteries. 13. The serratus magnus muscle. 14. The snb- scapular artery. The posterior circumflex and thoracica axillaris branches are i seen in the figure between the inferior thoracic and subscapular. The anterior r circumflex is observed, between the two heads of the biceps, crossing the neck 3 of the humerus. 1.1. The superior profunda artery. 16. The inferior pro- 3 funda. 17. The anastomotica magna inosculating inferiorly with the anterior '1 ulnar recurrent. 18. The termination of the superior profunda, inosculating j with the radial recurrent in the interspace between the brachialis anticus and ,3 supinator longus. J

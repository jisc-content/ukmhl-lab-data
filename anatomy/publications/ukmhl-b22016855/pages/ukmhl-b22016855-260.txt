244 POSTBRIOR BRACHIAL REGION. ception of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The muscle accompanies the extensor ossis metacarpi. The Extensor secundi internodii pollicis awes from the ulna, and interosseous membrane. Its Fig, 103.* tendon passes through a distinct canal in the annular ligament, and is inserted into the base ol the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its external sur- face with the same relations as the extensor ossis metacarpi. By its deep surface with the ulna, interos- seous membrane, radius, wrist-joint, radial artery, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The muscle is placed between the extensor primi inter- nodii and extensor indicis. The Extensor iNOicisawes from the ulna, as high up as the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct groove in the radius, and is inserted into the aponeurosis formed bj"^ the common extensor tendon of the in- dex finger. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, with the ex- ception of the hand, where the ten- don rests upon the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger and second inter- osseous muscle, and has no relation with the radial artery. The tendons of the extensors, as of the flexor muscles of the fore- arm, are provided with sjTiovial bursae as they pass beneath the an- nular ligaments; those of the back of the wrist have distinct sheaths, formed by the posterior annular ligament. * The deep layer of muscles of the posterior aspect of the fore-arm. 1. The lower part of the humerus. 2. The olecranon. 3. The ulna. 4. The anco- neus muscle. 5. The supinator brevis muscle. 6. The extensor ossis meta- carpi pollicis. 7. The extensor primi internodii pollicis. 8. The extensor secundi internodii pollicis. 9. The extensor indicis. 10. The first dorsal inter- osseous muscle. The other three dorsal interossci are seen between the meta- carpal bones of their respective fingers.

Fig. 3.1 which rapidly destroy the parent membrane and attain a greater size (ttcTo inch) than the parent cell, each cell being, as in the pre- vious case, separated to a slight extent from its neighbour by inter- * Figures illustrative of the development of bone; they are magnified 155 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. a. A portion of cartilage the farthest removed from the seat of ossification, showing simple nucleated cells, having an ordinary size of ‘jiigd of <>■0 inch, long diameter, b. The same cartilage, nearer the seat of ossification; each simple cell has produced two, which are a little larger than the cells in figure a. t The same cartilage, still nearer the seat of ossification ; each single cell of B has given birth to four, five, or six cells, which form clusters. These clusters become larger towards the right of the figure, and their cells more numerous and larger, tsW of ^och, long diameter.

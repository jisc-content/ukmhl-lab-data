The Internal calcanean branches, three or four in number, proceed from the posterior tibial artery immediately before its division ; they are distributed to the inner side of the os calcis, to the integument, and to the muscles wliich arise from its inner tuberosity, and they anastomose with tlie external calcanean branches, and with all the neighbouring arteries. PLANTAR arteries. The Internal plantar artery proceeds from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial at the inner malleolus, and passes along the inner Fig. 133.* * The arteries of the sole of the foot; the first and a part of the second layer of muscles having been removed. 1. The under and posterior part of the os calcis; to which the origins of the first layer of muscles remain attached. 2. The musculus accessorius. 3. The long fiexor tendons. 4. The tendon of the peroneus longus. 5. The termination of the posterior tibial arterj’. 6. The internal plantar. 7. The external plantar artery. 8. The plantar arch giving off four digital branches, which pass forwards on the interossei muscles. Three of these arteries are seen dividing, near the heads of the metatarsal bones, into collateral branches for adjoining toes.

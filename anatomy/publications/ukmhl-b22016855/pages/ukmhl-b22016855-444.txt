428 BASE OF THE BRAIN. the broad transverse band of white fibres which arches like a bridge across the upper part of the medulla oblongata; and, contracting on Fig. 144.* * The under surface or base of the brain. 1. The anterior lobe of one hemi- sphere of the cerebrum. 2. The middle lobe. 3. The posterior lobe almost concealed by (4) the hemisphere of the cerebellum. 5. The pyramidal lobe of the inferior vermiform process of the cerebellum. 6. The pneumogastric lobule. 7. The longitudinal fissure. 8. The olfactory nerves, with their bulbous ex- pansions. 9. The substantia perforata at the inner termination of the fissure of Sylvius; the three roots of the olfactory nerve are seen upon the substantia perforata. The commencement of the transverse fissure on each side is con- cealed by the inner border of the middle lobe. 10. The commissure of the optic nerves ; the numeral is placed between the optic nerves as they diverge from the commissure, and rests upon the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum. 11. The tuber cinereum, from which the infundibulum is seen projecting. 12. The corpora albicantia. 13. The locus perforatus, bounded on each side by the crura cerebri, and by the third nerve. 14. The pons Varolil 15. The crus cerebelli of one side. 16. The fifth nerve emerging from the anterior border of the crus cerebelli; the small nerve by its side is the fourth. 17. The sixth pair of nerves. 18. The seventh pair of nerves consisting of the auditory and facial 19. The corpora pyramidalia of the medulla oblongata ; the corpus olivare and part of the corpus restiforme are seen at each side. Just below the numeral is the decussation of the fibres of the corpora pyramidalia. 20. The eighth pair of nerves. 21. The ninth or hypoglossal nerve. 22. The anterior root of the first cervical spinal nerve.

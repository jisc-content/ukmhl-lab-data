A strong septum is given off from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fascia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groups, a middle and two lateral; and trans- verse septa are stretched between these to separate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive a part of their origin from the plan- tar fascia.

328 RADIAL ARTERY.—RRANCHER. Plan of the relations of the Radial Artery in the Fore-arm. In Front. Deep faBcia, Supinator longus. Inner Side. Pronator radii tores, Flexor carpi radialis. Ouler Side. Supinator longus, Radial nerve (middle third of its course). Behind. Supinator brevis. Pronator radii teres. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis, Pronator quadratus. Wrist-joint. The Branches of the radial artery may be arranged into three groups, corresponding with the three regions, the fore-arm, the wrist, and the hand; they are— Fore-arm., Wrist, Hand, Recurrent radial, Muscular, ' Superficialis volse, Carpalis anterior, - Carpalis posterior, Metacarpalis, . Dorsales pollicis. fPrinceps pollicis, J Radialis indicis, I Interosseae, l^Perforantes. The Recurrent branch is given off immediately below the elbow; it ascends in the space between the supinator longus and brachialis anti- cus to supply the joint, and inosculates with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. This vessel gives off numerous muscular branches. The Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles on the radial side of the fore-arm. The Superficialis voice is given off from the radial artery while at the wrist. It passes between the fibres of the abductor pollicis muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. This artery is very variable in size, being sometimes as large as the continuation of the radial, and at other times a mere muscular ramusculus, or entirely wanting; when of large size it supplies the palmar side of the thumb and the radial side of the index finger.

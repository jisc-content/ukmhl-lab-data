SUPERIOR REGION OF THE SKULL. 54 Across the upper part of the face is an irregular suture, the trans- verse, which connects the frontal bone with the nasal, superior maxil- lary, lachrymal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and malar bones. The remaining sutures are too unimportant to deserve particular names or description. Fig. 28.* REGIONS OF THE SKULL. The skull, considered as a whole, is divisible into four regions : a superior region, or vertex; a lateral region; an inferior region, or base; and an anterior region, the face. The SUPERIOR REGION, Or vertex of the skull, is bounded anteriorly by the frontal eminences ; on each side by the temporal ridges and parietal eminences ; and behind by the superior curved line of the * A front view of the skull. 1. The frontal portion of the frontal bone. The 2, immediately over the root of the nose, refers to the nasal tuberosity; the 3, over the orbit, to the supra-orbital ridge. 4. The optic foramen. 5. The sphenoidal fissure. 6. The spheno-maxillaiy fissure. 7. The lachrymal fossa in the lachrymal bone, the commencement of the nasal duct. The figures 4, 5, 6, 7, are within the orbit. 8. The opening of the anterior nares, divided into two parts by the vomer; the number is placed upon the latter. 9. The infra-orbital foramen. 10. The malar bone. 11. The s}Tnph)-sis of the lower jaw. 12. The mental foramen. 13. The ramus of the lower jaw. 14. The parietal bone. 16. The coronal suture. 16. The temporal bone. 17. The squamous suture. 18. The upper part of the great ala of the sphenoid bone. 19. The commence- ment of the temporal ridge. 20. The zygoma of the temporal bone, assisting to form the zygomatic arch. 21. The mastoid process.

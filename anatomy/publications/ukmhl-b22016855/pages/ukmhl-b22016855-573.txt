557 THE LUNGS. surrounds the base is also sharp. The colour of the lungs is pinkish- grey, mottled, and variously marked with black. The surface is figured with irregularly polyhedral outlines, which represent the lobules of the organ, and the area of each of these polyhedral spaces is crossed by lighter lines. Each lung is divided into two lobes, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the posterior surface of the upper part of the organ, downwards and forwards to neai’ the anterior angle of its base. In the right lung the upper lobe is subdivided by a second fissure. Fig. 176.* ♦ Anatomy of the heart and lungs, 1.

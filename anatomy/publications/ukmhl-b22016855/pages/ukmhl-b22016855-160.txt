144 CARP0-METACARP4L ARTICULATIONS. The dorsal ligaments are strong fasciculi which pass from the second range of carpal to the metacarpal bones. The palmar ligaments are thin fasciculi arranged upon the same plan on the palmar surface. The synovial membrane is a continuation of the great synovial membrane of the two rows of carpal bones. The capsular ligament of the thumb is one of the three true capsular ligaments of the skeleton ; the other two being the shoulder joint and hip joint. The articulation has a proper synovial membrane. Fig. 70.* I The metacarpal hones of the four fingers are firmly connected at their bases by means of dorsal and palmar ligaments, which extend transversely from one bone to the other, and by interosseous ligaments which pass between their contiguous surfaces.

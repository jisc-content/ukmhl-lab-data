THE DIAPHBAGM. Is fan-shaped; the expanded portion of the fan being horizontal, and the narrow portion or handle, ver* tical. It presents for examination its points of origin & the fibres arising from them, its eentral or ________ __ — ,__^.„«„ cordiform tendon, its openings, & its relations. POINTS OF ORIGIN & FIBRES ARISING FROM THEM: Ensiform Cartilage - Gives attachment to a narrow & sometimes tendinous slip, on either side ot wnicn the costal cartilages & the costal fibres bound a narrow triangular area, over the extent n +-i „ of which area the pleuraa & the peritoneum are separated only by a little areolar tissue. Cartilages & Osseous Portions of the 6 or 7 Lower Ribs - Give rise to the long arched T . . . . lateral fibres, which, at their point of origin, interdigitate with the transversal is. Lilgamentum Areuatum Internum - A thickened band of the fascia over the psoas, extending trom side of body of 1st, & sometimes from that of 2nd lumbar vertebra, to tip of transverse process of 1st & sometimes to that of 2nd. Gives rise to arched fibres similar but rather shorter. iilgamentum Arcuatum Externum - A thickened band of the fascia over quadratus lumborum (anterior lamella of posterior abdominal aponeurosis), extending from tip of transverse process ot first lumbar vertebra, & sometimes from that of 2nd, to lower border & apex of last rib. rt j. , . '_ Gires rise to similar arched fibres. ^rifhV Se^on^.T1l1,rd & Fourth Lumbar Vertebra? by means of the is&VKA — l wo thick fibro-muscular bundles, which arise bv tendinous fibres as follows: Kight Crus - The thickest & longest, from front of bodies & intervertebral substances of 1st, t mf ' ^r R0Tnetimes of 2nd> 3rd, & 4th lumbar v., & from ant. common ligfc. of spine. LEFT Crus - The shortest & narrowest, from left side of bodies & intervertebral substances of 1st & 2nd or sometimes of 2nd & 3rd lumbar vertebra, & from ant. common ligfc. of spine. . . ,T.he tendons ascend for a short distance on either side of the aorta, and then become joined m front of that vessel by means of a tendinous arch formed by the blending of their innermost fibres. The crura then give rise, as well as the intervening arch to two large fleshy bellies, the outer fasciculi of which bellies pass upwards & outwards to the cordiform tendon, while the inner ones first decussate in front of the aorta (those of the right side being the largest & most anterior), then diverge to surround the oesophagus, and finally meet again in iront of it before they end in the central tendon. (In some very rare cases these fasciculi do not join in front of the oesophagus, a portion of the anterior margin of the oesophageal opening is then tendinous). CENTRAL Or CORDIFORM TENDON — The common insertion of all the fibres. Has somewhat the shape of a trefoil leaf; and presents anteriorly three leaflets; the right one is long, broad, & the largest; the left one, long, narrow, & the smallest; the middle one short, broad, & OPENINGS - Are: intermediate in size. Large Openings - Three: Aortic Opening - For aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct & frequently the left cord of the sym- pathetic. Lies in middle line, and is osteo-fibrous, being bounded behind by bodies of vertebrae, laterally by tendons of the crura, and in front by the fibrous arch which joins the latter. (Esophageal Opening - For oesophagus & pneumogastric nerves. Lies higher up, & a little to the left. Is oval in form & entirely muscular, being formed by the inner decussating fasciculi of the fleshy portion of the crura; - in some very rare cases a portion of the anterior margin is fibrous, & formed by the posterior border of cordiform tendon. Opening for Inferior Vena Cava - The highest; lies a little to the right between right & middle leaflets of cordiform tendon. Is quadrilateral & fibrous, being bounded by four bundles of tendin- Small Openings - Transmit; ons fibres which meefc at risht ansles- Right cord of sympathetic, &* sometimes the left; Right & left great, lesser, &* least splanchnic nerves, either separately or conjointly. Vena azygos minor, 6° sometimes the major - These openings vary therefore in number. RELATIONS - Of Upper Surface: Laterally - Pleurae; lungs. Also at circumference of thorax for a considerable though variable ex- tent, lower ribs & lower intercostal spaces, the lungs not descending under ordinary circum- stances as low as the costal attachments of the diaphragm & the point of reflection of the pleurae The lateral portions of the diaphragm are the most movable; their degree of elevation or depression varies much more than that of the central part in accordance with the respiratory movements, and with the degree of distension, or otherwise, of the stomach, intestines, & uterus. The right lateral portion of the diaphragm, on account of the pressure of the liver on that side, rises by one or two ribs' breadths higher than the left, and reaches the level of In Forced Expiration -4th costal cartilage; In State of Repose of Thorax - 5th costal cartilage; In Forced Inspiration - Line from ensiform cartilage, to back of 10th rib. Centrally - Heart & base of pericardium, the fibrous layer of which latter sac blends more particu- larly with the anterior & left part of central leaflet of cordiform tendon, & with the fascia covering the left anterior costal fibres. The central part of the diaphragm is flattened & less movable, and lies on a lower level than the lateral portions, except close to the sternum, in front, & to the vertebras, behind, where, on the contrary, it rises a little higher. Of Under Surface - This is entirely covered by peritoneum except behind pancreas, kidneys & supra- renal capsules, and at points of attachment of coronary & lateral ligaments of liver, gastro-phrenio ligament, & suspensory ligament of spleen; it lies in mediate contact wikk liver, stomach & spleen.

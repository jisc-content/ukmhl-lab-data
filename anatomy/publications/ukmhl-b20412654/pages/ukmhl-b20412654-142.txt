ISO LUMBAR PLEXUS. Formed by anterior divisions of four upper lumbar nerves, and situated in substance of psoas, in front of transverse pi*ocesses of tbe lumbar vertebrae. Narrow above, where it usually receives a small branch from last dorsal nerve ; broad below, where it is joined to the sacral plexus by a branch from 4th lumbar nerve & by lumbo- sacral nerve or cord. Its arrangment is as follows* - (Vide Quain's diagram). 1st Lumbar Nerve - Gives off: Llio-hypogastric, Uio-inguinal, Small part of Genito-crural, Communicating branch to 2nd Lumbar. 2nd Lumbar Nerve - Completes Genito-crural, - and gives off Greater part of External Cutaneous, and Communicating branch to 3rd Lumbar, from which communicating branch the Anterior Crural, Obturator, & Accessory Obturator nerves (when the latter exists) are partly derived, 3rd Lumbar Nerve - Completes External Cutaneous, and gives off Greater part of Anterior Crural, Obturatot 6Â° Accessory Obturator Nerves (when the latter exists), and a Communicating branch to 4th Lumbar. 4th Lumbar Nerve - Completes Anterior Crural, Obturator, &> Accessory Obturatot Nerves, (when the latter exists), and gives off a Large branch to <t>h Lumbar, which large branch forms with the latter nerve the Lumbosacral Nerve ar Cord,

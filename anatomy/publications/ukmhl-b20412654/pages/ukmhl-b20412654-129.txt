117 THE SMALL INTESTINE. Is a slightly narrowing convoluted tube about 20 feet long, connected to the spine by the me. sentery in the greatest part of its extent. It is divided into: DUODENUM — Vide below. SMALL INTESTINE PROPER — Is rather arbitrarily divided, no denned limit existing, into: JEJUNUM — The upper two fifths. Wider, thicker, & more vascular, and has its villi & valvulae conniventes more, and its Payer's patches less, numerous & developed. ILEUM — The lower three-fifths. Narrower, thinner, & less vascular, and has its villi & its valvules conniventes less, and its Payer's patches more, numerous & developed. THE DUODENUM Is the shortest, widest & thickest part of the small intestine, and has no mesentery. Its length is from 8 to 10 inches, or about twelve finger breadths. - Into it open by a common orifice the common bile & pancreatic ducts, and the villi & valvule conni- ventes are larger & more numerous immediately below this opening than in any other part of the small intestine. - Its course is: Upwards fa to the right to under surface of liver 6° neck of gall-bladder ; Downwards in front of right kidney ; Transversely to the left to left side of 2nd lumbar vertebra, where it is crossed by superior mesenteric artery, and where mesentery begins. RELATIONS: First, or Ascending Portion - Above - Under surface of liver & neck of gall-bladder j Behind - Right border of lesser omentum, hepatic artery, bile duct, portal vein. Second, or Descending Portion - In Front - Hepatic flexure of colon j Behind - Bight kidney; On Inner Side - Head of pancreas, ductus communis choledochus, pan- creatico-duodenal arteries. Third, or Transverse Portion - In Front - Descending layer of transverse meso-oolon, superior mesen- teric vessels. Behind - Aorta, inferior vena cava, crura of diaphragm j Above - Lower border of panoreas, superior mesenteric vessels. 1G

291 TABLEAU of the FIFTH NERVE. From side of pons Varolii by two roots, anterior small or motor, posterior large or sensory. Sensory root to Gasserian Ganglion motor root to inferior maxillary nerve outside cranium. Gasserian Ganglion gives off; OPHTHALMIC — The smallest. Through outer wall of cavernous sinus below & externally to the other nerves, and divides into: Lachrymal - The smallest of the three divisions of ophthalmic. Frontal - The largest. Nasal - Intermediate in size. Gives off branches: ganglionic, long ciliary, in- fratrochlear. Ophthalmic, Ciliary or Lenticular Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from nasal branch of ophthalmic* Motor, from branch of 3rd nerve to inferior oblique* Sympathetic, from cavernous plexus. Branches - The ciliary nerves. SUPERIOR MAXILARY — Intermediate in size between ophthalmic & infer- ior maxillary. Through foramen rotundum, sphenomaxillary fossa, & infraorbital canal to infraorbital foramen, where divides into palpebral, nasal, labial. Gives off branches: orbital or temporo-malar, sphenopalatine, posterior & anterior dental. Sphenopalatine or Meckel's Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from superior maxillary. Motor, from facial through vidian. Sympathetic, from carotid plexus also through vidian. Branches: Ascending - Small filaments to periosteum of orbit. Descending - Anterior or great palatine, external palatine, posterior or small palatine, Internal - Superior nasal, nasopalatine. Posterior - Vidian, pterygopalatine. INFERIOR MAXILLARY — The largest, both sensory & motor. Divides just below base of skull into : Anterior or Smaller Division - Principally motor. Divides into branches: masseteric, two deep temporal, buccal, two pterygoid. Posterior or Larger Division - Sensory with a few motor fibres. Divides into auriculotemporal, gustatory, inferior dental, the latter giving off the mylo-hyoid branch. Otic or Arnold's Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from auriculo-temporal, and also from glosso- pharyngeal through small petrosal. Motor, from inferior maxillary & its internal pterygoid branch, also from facial through small petrosal. Sympathetic, from plexus on middle meningeal artery. Branches - To tensor palati & tensor tympani. Submaxillary Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from gustatory. Motor, from facial through chorda tympani. Sympathetic, from plexus on facial artery. Blanches - To mucous membrane of mouth, Wharton's duct, & submax. illary gland.

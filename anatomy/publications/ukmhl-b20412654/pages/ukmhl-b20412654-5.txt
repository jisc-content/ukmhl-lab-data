FOURTH EDITION, OR SELECTION OE THE TABLETS BELIEVED TO BE MOST USEFUL TO STUDENTS GENERALLY. " The schemes of any of the arts or sciences may be analysed in a sort of skeleton, and represented upon tables, with the various dependencies and connections of the several parts and subjects that belong to them; and the frequent review of these abstracts and epitomes would tend much to imprint them on the brain, when they have been once well learned; this would keep those learned traces always open, and assist the weakness of a labouring memory."

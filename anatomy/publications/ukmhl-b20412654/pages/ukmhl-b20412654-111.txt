External Abdominal Ring - Triangular & oblique downwards & inwards, about 1 inch long & \ inch wide in male but rather smaller in female, bounded later- ally by external & internal pillars, above by the intercolumnar fibres, below by the crest of the pubes. Gives off from its margin the intercolumnar oi external spermatic fascia, which is prolonged into a tubular process around cord & testis (V. Abdominal Aponeuroses). Internal Abdominal Ring - A tubular opening in the fascia transversalis formed by the prolongation of this fascia round the cord & testis (infundibuliform fascia, fascia propria), oval with large diameter directed downwards & out- wards ; situated midway between anterior superior spine of ilium & spine of pubes about \ an inch above Poupart's ligament; bounded above & externally by the lower arched fibres of internal oblique & transversalis, below & inter. nally by epigastric vessels. Boundaries or Walls - Formed by: In Fjjont - Aponeurosis of external oblique along whole length j lowest fibres of internal obliqtte along outer third. Behind - Fascia transversalis along whole length; conjoined tendon of internal oblique & transversalis, & also triangular ligament along inner third. Above - Arched fibres of internal oblique & transversalis. Below -Poupart's ligament blended posteriorly with fascia transversalis Ha

231 INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. From under surface of subclavian, opposite thyroid axis. Downwards behind phrenic nerve a/id internal jugular & subclavian vein3 to pos- terior aspect of costal cartilages a short distance from sternum. Descends between thoracic wall & pleura, giving off branches: - Perforating} Anle/ior Intercostal, Anterior Mediastinal, & Comes Nervi Phrenici, and divides between 6th & 7th costal cartilages & beneath triangularis stertii into branches Musculophrenic, &•» Superior Epigastric. Its two vena} comites unite into one trunk before they open into the innominate. Perforating - Forwards through five or six upper intercostal spaces to pectoralis rxajor, integument, and mamma. Ajjtbrior, Intercostal Outwards in five or s:x upper intercostal spaces between internal intercostal muscles & pleura, and divide between internal & ex- ternal intercostal muscles into superior & inferior branches which inoscu- ' late with corresponding branches of corresponding aortic intercostals, and are similarly distributed. Anterior Mediastinal - Small, irregular ; to pericardium, remains of thymus gland & cellular tissue of anterior mediastinum. Comes Nervi Phrenici (Superior Phrenic) - From upper part of aitery. Long, slender; with phrenic nerve to diaphragm, and anastomose with musculo-phrenic, & inferior phrenic from abdominal aorta. Musculo-Piirenic - Downwards & outwards behind cartilages of false ribs, supplying diaphragm, which it perforates opposite 8th or 9th rib, & abdominal muscles, and giving off a small anterior intercostal branch to each of the lower intercostal spaces. Superior Epigastric - Enters sheath of rectus posteriorly, and anastomoses with epi- gastric branch of external iliac, lower intercostals & lumbar; gives twigs to rectus <Ss to integument of middle line of abdomen,

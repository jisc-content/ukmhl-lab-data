2 THE VERTEBRAE. Present for examination: - Body - Forms a shox*t column, which presents: Surface - Convex from side to side, concave from above downwards; presents numerous small vascular foramina. Pqst. Surface - Concave from side to side, flat from above downwards; presents one or more irregular apertures for exit of venae basis vertebrae & Under Surfaces - Rough & slightly concave, and surrounded by a pro- minent rim. Pedicles - J°in the body to the laminae. They are constricted, and their constriction gives rise to the Notches - Which latter, by the superposition of the vertebras, form the intervertebral fora* mina. Laminse - Broad & flat, rough above & below for the ligamenta subflava; bound posteriorly Foramen - Which, by the superposition of the vertebrae, forms the spinal canal. Spinous process -Projects backwards from the point of junction of the lamina©. Transverse processes - Two. Project outwards from the sides of the arch. Articular processes - Pour. Projec t upwards & downwards from the point of junction the pedicles with the laminae. The superior ones look backwards, the inferior ones look forwards ]sjt But little, which would bo applicable to each of the three groups of vertebrae, can, it is believed, be added to this description.

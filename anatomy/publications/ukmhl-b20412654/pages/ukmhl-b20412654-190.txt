TEMPORAL ARTERY. Commences in substance of parotid gland between neck of condyle & external auditory meatus. Ascends in groove between condyle & external auditory meatus, and crosses posterior root of zygoma. Ascends for about two inches upon temporal muscle & fascia, and beneath skin & attra- hens aurem, with branches of facial & auriculo-temporal nerves, and divides into: Allt. Temporal - The smaller. Forwards over forehead, and joins with supraorbital & frontal. Post. Temporal - The larger. Upwards & backwards, and joins with posterior auricular & occipital. Gives off before its division i TwigS - To parotid gland & temporo-maxillary articulation. Transverse Facial - Forwards through parotid gland, and across face be- tween Steno's duct & zygoma; joins with facial & infraorbital. Middle Temporal - Through temporal fascia to temporal muscle, joining with deep temporal branches of internal maxillary. Often gives off Orbital Branch - To outer angle of orbit along upper border of zygoma & between the two layers of temporal fascia. Ant. Auricular - Two or three small branches to external ear.

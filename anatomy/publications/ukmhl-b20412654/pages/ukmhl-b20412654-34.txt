24 HYOID BONE. Horse-shoe shaped, and suspended by stylohyoid ligaments from tips of styloid processes of temporal bones. Consists in youth of five parts, the body and the greater & lesser cornua, which parts are joined together by four arthrodiee; the cornua usually join with the body, the greater ones towards the middle period of life, the lesser ones in advanced age. BODY — Quadrilateral. Presents* Anterior Surface - Convex, looks upwards & forwards, and is marked by a crucial ridge. The part above the ridge gives attachment to the hyo-glossus, genio-hyo-glo3Sus & genio-hyoid; the part below the ridge gives attachment to the mylo-hyoid, the stylohyoid & the aponeurosis of the digastric. Posterior Surface - Smooth, concave; looks backwards & downwards, and is sepa. rated from the epiglottis & the thyro-hyoid membrane by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, in which a bursa is usually found. Upper Border - Thick & rounded; gives attachment to genio-hyo-glossus by its an- terior lip, to thyro-hyoid membrane by its posterior lip. Lower Border - Thinner; gives attachment to sterno-, omo-, & thyro-hyoid. GREATER CORNU — Projects backwards & slightly upwards, giving attachment super- iorly to the hyo-glossus, internally to the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and externally to the thyro-hyoid. It diminishes in size from before backwards, and is flattened from above downwards. Its slightly enlarged extremity gives attachment to the lateral thyro-hyoid ligament. XjESSER CORNU^— Small, conical; projects upwards & backwards from point of junction of body & greater cornu, and gives attachment to the stylo-hyoid ligament.

159 THYEOID AXIS. Short thick trunk from front of first part of subclavian clo*e to inner border of scalenus anticus. Divides almost immediately into : - Inferior Thyroid - Suprascapular or Transversalis Humeri Crosses lower part of soalenus anticus under cover of sterno-mastoid. Outwards behind clavicle, beneath omo-hyoid. Beneath trapezius, and over transverse ligament of scapula to supraspinous fossa, where it ramifies between the muscle & the bone. Crosses neck of scapula to infraspinous fossa. - Anastomoses with the other scapular arteries, supplies shoulder-joint & subscapularis, and gives off a small supra-aoromial twig. Transversalis Colli Crosses upper part of subclavian triangle in front of scaleni & brachial plexus, passing sometimes between the trunks of the plexus, and divides beneath trapezius into: Superficial Cervical - Ascends beneath trapezius to muscles & glands of back of neck, and anastomoses with superficial branch of arteria princeps cervicis. Posterior Scapular - Beneath levator anguli scapulae to superior angle of scapula, and then along posterior border of the bone beaeath rhomboidei as far as its inferior angle, anastomosing with the other scapular arteries & the intercostals. Frequently arises from 3rd part of subclavian.

275 THE THIRD VENTRICLE As a narrow median fissure comprised between the optic thalami, and extending to the base of the brain. It presents: Roof - Formed by under surface of fornix and by velum interpositum. Floor - Corresponds to interpeduncular space on under surface of cerebrum, and is formed from before backwards by the lamina cinerea, tuber cinereum & infundibulum, corpora albicantia and locus perforatus posticus. It is oblique downwards & forwards, and is covered by a thick layer of grey matter. It presents in the foetus the opening of the iter ad infundibulum. Lateral Walls - Formed by inner surface of optic thalami, which surface is bounded above by superior peduncles of pineal gland, and is covered below by part of the grey matter of the third ventricle prolonged upwards from its floor. - The lateral walls are joined together by the middle or soft commissure, a transverse band of grey matter continuous with the remainder of the grey matter of the 3rd ventricle. Ant. Extremity - Formed by anterior crura of fornix. In front of these is the anterior commissure, a transverse band of white fibres, which perforates laterally the corpora striata & spreads out into the substance of both hemispheres. - Between the crura & the optic thalami are the foramina of Monro, through which the lateral & 3rd ventricles communicate, and the anterior extremities of the velum interpositum pass from the 3rd into the lateral ventricles to form the choroid plexuses of the latter. Post. Extremity - Formed by posterior commissure, a transverse band of white fibres con- necting posteriorly the optic thalami. Below this is the opening of the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculura, and above are the tubercula quadrigemina & the pineal gland. For parts above mentioned see foregoing Tablets. N â€¢

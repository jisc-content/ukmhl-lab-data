SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. Intermediate in size between ophthalmic & inferior maxillary nerves. - Commences at middle of Gasserian ganglion Through foramen rotundum, spheno-maxillary fossa & infraorbital canal to infraorbital foramen, and divides beneath levator labii superioris into palpebral, nasal &> labial branches, which branches anastomose with facial nerve forming infraorbital plexus and supply muscles, skin & mucous membrane. BRANCHES: Orbital or TeiXiporO-malar Br. - Into orbit through spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into: Temporal Br. - In groove & through foramen in malar bone, joining with lachrymal j Pierces temporal muscle & fascia to skin of temple, and joins with 1 facial & auriculotemporal. Malar Br. - Through foramen in malar bone to skin of prominent part of cheek. Sph.6X10-palatine Brs. - Two. To Meckel's ganglion, of which they form the sensory root. Post. Dental Brs. - Two: Anterior or Superficial - Over maxillary tuberosity to gums & buccinator. Posterior or Deep - Forwards in outer wall of Antrum, joinisg anterior dental nerve, and supplies molar & second bicuspid teeth & mucous membrane of Antrum. Ant. Dental Br. - Arises just before exit of superior maxillary nerve from infra- orbital canal. Downwards & forwards in anterior wall of Antrum joining with posterior dental nerve, and supplies incisor, canine & first bicuspid teeth and mucous membrane of inferior meatus. A twig joins superior nasal branch of Meckel's ganglion above eye-tooth, and presents a small ganglion, the ganglion of Bochdalek.

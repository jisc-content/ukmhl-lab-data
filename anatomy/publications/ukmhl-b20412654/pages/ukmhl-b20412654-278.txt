266 COVERINGS of the BEAIN & O0RD-3rd Tablet. THE PIA MATER On the cerebrum & cerebellum the pia mater is a delicate areolar membrane, very thin & vascular. It is thick, dense, and but slightly vascular, on the pons, the crura cerebri & the cord. It is everywhere intimately adherent to the nervous substance; it dips down between the convolutions of the cerebrum and the laminee of the cerebellum, and passes into the ante- rior and posterior median fissures of the cord 5 it is prolonged upon the nerves and their roots. The pia mater of the brain penetrates into the ventricular cavities through the transverse fissure, and forms the velum interpositum and the choroid plexuses. - It usually presents an opening at the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle, by which opening the subarach- noidean space of the brain & cord communicates with the ventricular cavities of the brain. The pia mater of the cord presents anteriorly the linea splendens, a whitish longitudinal fibrous band, and laterally, the ligamentum denticulatum. This latter descends along the whole length of the side of the cord between the anterior & the posterior roots of the nervesj its outer edge is denticulated; the denticulations, about twenty.two in number, cross the subarachnoidean space with the arachnoid reflected over them, and become attached to the dura mater in the intervals of the successive pairs of spinal nerves, The first denticu- lation is situated opposite the foramen magnum, between the vertebral artery & the hypo, glossal nerve. â€” Opposite the termination of the cord the pia mater blends with the dura mater to form the ligamentum centrale, which latter passes down to the back of the coccyx, and, in its upper part, contains the filiform prolongation of the grey matter of the cord, termed the filum terminale.

160 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. Formed as follows by anterior divisions of 5th, 6th, 7th, & 8th cervical and 1st dorsal ns.: Fifth dr» Sixth Cervical unite between anterior & middle scaleni, and form the OUTER PRIMARY CORD. Eighth 6° First Dorsal unite behind scalenus anticus, and form the inner Seventh forms alone the middle primary cord. [primary cord. All three primary cords divide into anterior & posterior divisions. Anterior divisions of outer & middle primary cords form the outer cord. Anterior division of inner primary cord forms the inner cord. Posterior divisions of all three*primary cords form the posterior cord. Broad between anterior & middle scaleni, where anterior divisions of the nerves lie above 2nd part of subclavian artery; contracted opposite clavicle, where inner & outer cords lie at fore part of plexus on outer side of 3rd part of subclavian artery & of 1st part of axillary; again expanded in axilla, where the three cords lie on inner, outer & posterior aspects of 2nd part of axillary, and where they break up into the large nerves of upper limb. Communicates with the cervical plexus through loop between 4th & 5th nerves & through branch from 5th nerve to phrenic, and with middle & inferior ganglia of sympathetic. BRANCHES — Are ABOVE THE CLAVICLE: IPost, or Long Thoracic, or Ext. Respiratory of Sir C. Bell - From 5th & 6th nerves, the two roots uniting in substance of sea- lenus anticus. Deeply along side of chest behind axillary vessels & cords of brachial plexus as far as lowest digitation of serratus magnus. Suprascapular - From back of trunk formed by union of 5th & 6th. Backwards & outwards beneath trapezius & through suprascapular foramen to supraspinous fossa, where lies between supraspina- tus & the bone. Eound spine of scapula to infraspinous fossa. - Supplies supra- & infra- spinati (two twigs to each), shoulder-joint & scapula. 2YElISC1llar - To rhomboidei & frequently to levator anguli scapulas (from 5th nerve), subclavius (from 5th & 6th, anastomoses frequently with phrenic), scaleni & longus colli (variably from 6th 7th & 8th.) COHlXnUXlicatillg - From 5th cervical to phrenic on anterior scalenus. BELOW THE CLAVICLE — The branches are given off from the three cords as follows, from: Outer Cord - External anterior thoracic, outer head of median, mus- culo-cutaneous or external cutaneous. Inner Cord - Internal anterior thoracic, inner head of median, ulnar, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous or n. of Wrisberg. Posterior Cord - The three subscapular nerve3, musculo-spiral & circumflex.

158 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. From innominate artery behind upper border of sterno-clavicular articulation (right side), from end of transverse portion of arch of Aorta (left side), to outer border of first rib. Divided into three parts: - FIRST PART — From origin to inner border of scalenus antious. SEuONO PART — Lies behind scalenus anticus at a somewhat variable level above clav- icle. S hort; forms higest part of arch described by the artery. - Relations : In Front - Scalenus anticus, subclavian vein, phrenic nerve. Behind - Scalenus medius. Above - Brachial plexus. Beloiv - Pleura. Subclavian Vein lies below & in front of artery, from which it is separated by scalenus anticus. BRANCHES — Superior Intercostal on right side; generally no branch on left side. THIRD PART — From outer border of scalenus anticus to outer border of first rib. Crosses lower & inner part of posterior triangle of neok, lying in the small spaca bounded by omo.hyoid, clavicle & scalenus ant. - Relations: In front - Skin, superficial fascia, platysma, descending branches of superficial cervical plexus, deep fascia, transversalis colli vein. Clavicle, subclavius & its nerve, transversalis humeri vessels, exter- nal jugular vein with the plexus frequently formed by the suprascapular & transversalis oc .li. Behind - Scalenus medius. Above — Brachial plexus, omo-hyoid. Below - Outer surface of first rib. Subclavian vein lies below, in front, & to inner side of artery. BRANCH — Frequently the Posterior Scapular, which is otherwise derived from the transversalis colli.

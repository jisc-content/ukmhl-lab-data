Under Surface - Has no ridge nor groove. Borders - Are turned inwards & outwards. Inner Border - Concave, thin; presents inner part of tuberole for scalenus anticus. Outer Border - Convex & rounded. Head - Small, rounded, with a single facet for 1st dorsal vertebra. Neck - Short & rounded. Tuberosity - Large, prominent, situated on outer border. Angle - Blended with tuberosity. Anterior Extremity - Large & thick. Second Rib - Is longer, less curved, only slightly oblique, and scarcely twisted. Surfaces - Look slightly outwards & inwards. Outer or Upper Surface - Rough & prominent towards its middle for second & IJ third digitations of serratus magnus; rough posteriorly for n scalenus posticus. Inner or Under Surface - Has but a short & slightly marked groove. Tuberosity & Angle - Close together; the latter slightly marked. Tenth Rib Head - Has usually but a single articular facet. Eleventh Rib Head - But a single articular facet. No Neck. No Tuberosity. Twelth Rib Head - But a single anterior facet. No Neck. No Tuberosity. No Angle. No Groove.

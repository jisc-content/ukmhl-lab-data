251 INTERIOR of the HEART- LEFT SIDE. Has thicker walls than the right, and is smaller in its auricular portion. AURICLE — Divided, as is the right, into two parts, the Appendix Auriculae - Longer, narrower, more curved & indented than on right side, ecd constricted at its orifice j its musculi pectin ati are smaller & leS3 numerous. Overlaps pulmonary artery. Sinus - More regularly cuboid than on right side. - Presents* Openings of the Pulkonary veins - Four, at upper part, two on the right close to septum, two on the left, the latter sometimes uniting. Auriculo-Ventricular Opening - With the Mitral valve ("Vide below). VENTRICLE — Rounded & conical; its walls are thicker than those of the right. Presents: Auriculo-Ventricular Opening - Situated opposite centre of sternum on a level with third costal cartilages, between & behind the aortic & right auriculo-ventrioular openings, or rather directly behind the aortic open- ing (Sibson). Somewhat smaller than on right side. Presents the Mitral Valve - Larger, thicker & stronger than the tricuspid. Consists of two principal segments, of which the largest is in front. The chordae tendineae attached to its under surface are stronger & thicker, but are less numerous, than those on the right side. Aortic Opening - Situated behind centre of sternum on a level with lower border of 3rd costal cartilage, and directly in front of the left auriculo.ventri- cular opening. Presents the Semilunar Valves - Larger, thicker & stronger than those of pulmonary artery; lunulae wider, corpora Arantii more prominent, and sinuses of Valsalva deeper. Columns Carnejs - Those attached by one side and those attached by both extre- mities are smaller & more numerous. The musculi papillares are but two in number, but are larger, and are attached, one to the anterior, the other to the posterior wall of the ventricle.

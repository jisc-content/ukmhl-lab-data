87 THE PLANTAR ARTERIES Branches of bifurcation of posterior tibial beneath internal annular ligament & origin of ab- ductor pollicis. INTERNAL PLANTAR - The smaller. Forwards between abductor pollicis & flexor brevis digitorum, and ends at extremity of first metatarsal bone in a small branch which runs along inner border of great toe, and joins with the corresponding plantar digital artery from communicating branch of dorsalis pedis, EXTERNAL PLANTAR - The larger. Outwards between flexor brevis digitorum & flexor accessorius, and then forwards be- tween former muscle & abductor minimi digiti as far as base of 5th metatarsal bone. Bound outer border of flexor accessorius, and inwards upon interossei & bases of the metatarsal bones, -beneath adductor pollicis, flexor tendons & lumbricales,- to back of first interosseous space, where inosculates with communicating branch of dorsalis pedis, thus completing plantar arch. BRANCHES: Posterior perforating —Three -Through back part of three outer interos. seous spaces, and inosculate with dorsal interosseous branches from metatarsal. Plantar interosseous (Digital) — Four. Forwards upon interosseous spaces (outermost crossing under surface of 5th metatarsal bone under cover of abductor & flexor brevis minimi digiti), and supply plantar digital branches to 3£ toes on outer side of foot. The three innermost give off the Ant. Perforating arteries - Three. Through anterior part of three outer interosseous spaces, and inosculate with the dorsal interos- seous branches from metatarsal just before they bifurcate.

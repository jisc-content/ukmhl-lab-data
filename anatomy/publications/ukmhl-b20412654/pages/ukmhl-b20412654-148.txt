SIDE VIEW of the MALE PELVIS. HOW to Obtain it (the Perinaeum having been previously dissected) : - Incline bladder & rectum to the right. Divide on left side obliterated hypogastric, vesical & middle hemorrhoidal arteries, (and the uterine & vaginal in female), lateral true ligament of bladder & levator ani muscle. Saw through pubes externally to left anterior true ligament of bladder. Divide right common iliac artery & left common iliac vein, and saw through sacrum & coccyx just to the left of middle line. Detach deep perinseal fascia & the contained compressor urethrse muscle from rami of pubes & ischium. Introduce catheter into, and inflate, bladder; distend rectum with tow. What it shows: - Towards middle • - Cut edge of the deep perineal fascia, containing between its two layers : — Cut edges of compressor uretkrce 6° deep transverse muscles ; Membranous portion of urethra ; Pudic vessels £r> nerve with the vessels <Sr» nerve of the bulb j Cowper's glands dr3 their ducts. Below and in front of the deep perinaeal fascia : — Bulb of urethra partly covered by prolongation of anterior or inferior layer of deep peri* mval fascia, which latter passes down upon it and becomes lost on its surface. Above and behind the deep perinseal fascia: - Cttt edges of levator ani muscle 6° of recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia, which latter is seen further up to ascend upon bladder, prostate, &> rectum. The viscera of the pelvis and the vessels & nerves of the right side can now be examined conveniently.

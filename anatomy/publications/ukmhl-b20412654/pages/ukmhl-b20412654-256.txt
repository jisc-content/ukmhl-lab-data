244 the pleura; Surrounds the iung, lines the parietes of the thorax, and forms the lateral boundary of the mediastina. Tracing it horizontally from the sternum it passes: - Over costal cartilages, rids, <SrÂ» intercostal spaces; Forwards along side of posterior mediastinum; Outwards over posterior aspect of root of lung ; Round posterior part of inner surface, posterior border, outer surface, anterior border, ante. rior part of the inner surface of lung, dipping into the fissures between the lobes/ Inwards over anterior aspect of root of lung ; Forwards along side of pericardium to sternum. Inferiorlv it covers the diaphragm, from which a thin triangular fold, the ligamentum latum pulmonis, passes up along the side of the pericardium to the inner surface of the lung & to the lower border of its root. Superiorly it ascends into the neck an inch or an inch & a half above the first rib, and, under cover of the scaleni, comes in contact with the first & second portions of the subclavian artery. It is thinnest & most adherent over the lung & over the diaphragm. It is thickest & least ad- herent over the thoracic walls. Its inner surface is covered by a layer of pavement epi- thelium, and is moistened by a serous fluid. Its arteries are from the intercostals, internal mammary, phrenic, inferior thyroid, pericardiac, & bronchial. - Its veins correspond to its arteries. - The lymphatics of the visceral layer join with those of the lung; the lymphatics of the parietal layer join with those of the mediastina & the thoracic walls. - Its nerves are derived from the pulmonary plexuses (Kolliker), and from the phrenic & sympathatio nerves (Lushka). The two pleurse come in contact behind the middle of the sternum.

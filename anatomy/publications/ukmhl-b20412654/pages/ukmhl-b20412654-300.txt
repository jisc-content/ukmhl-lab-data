288 METATARSAL BONES (Distinctive Characters). FIRST METATARSAL BONE — The shortest & much the thickest. Shaft - Very thick & strong. Tarsal Extremity - Presents a large semilunar facet for internal cuneiform, but has no lateral articular facets. It is prolonged below & externally into a prominent tubercle for tendon of peroneus longus. Digital Extremity - Large & broad. Presents inferiorly two grooved facets for sesamoid bs. SECOND METATARSAL BONE —The longest,* received posteriorly into the recess Tarsal Extremity - Presents: between the three °™eiforra bone3- Tarsal Facet - Triangular, for middle cuneiform. Lateral Facets — Three:- One internal for internal cuneiform; two external for ex- ternal cuneiform & 3rd metatarsal. These two latter facets are often divided into upper & lower halves by a rough horizontal groove for an interosseons ligt. THIRD METATARSAL BONE - A little shorter. Tarsal Extremity - Presents: Tarsal Facet - Triangular, for external cuneiform. Lateral Facets - Two: - One internal & one external for 2nd & 3rd metatarsal bs.; the former facet is often divided into upper & lower halves by an interosseous groove. FOURTH METATARSAL BONE — Tarsal Extremity - Presents : Tarsal Facet - Quadrilateral, for cuboid. Lateral Facets - Three : - One ext. for 5th metatarsal, two int. for 3rd metatarsal & ex- ternal cuneiform; the facet for the external cuneiform being sometimes absent. FIFTH METATARSAL BONE — The shortest but one. Tarsal Extremity - Presents: Tarsal Facet - Triangular, cut obliquely forwards & inwards, for cuboid; Lnternal Lateral Facet - For 4th metatarsal; Prominent External Tubercle - For peroneus brevis. N.B. —The foregoing characters supply the three points requisite to place the bones in position, and therefore to distinguish between right bones and left bones METACARPAL BONES (Distinctive Characters). METACARPAL B. OF THUMB — The shortest. Shaft - Thick & broad ; its palmar surface looks inwards. Carpal Extremity - Saddle-shaped for trapezium (convex from before backwards, concave from side to side) & broadest externally; no lateral facets. Digital Extremity - Broader & less convex anteriorly than in the other metacar- pal bones; presents two small lateral facets for sesamoid bones. METACARPAL B. OF INDEX — The longest. Carpal Extremity - Larger than in the others, and presents posteriorly a pro- longation upwards & inwards towards os magnum. Has four articular surfaces, one saddle-shaped above for trapezoid, and three others for trapezium, os magnum & 3rd metacarpal bono. METACARPAL B. OF MIDDLE FINGER — The longest but one. Carpal Extremity - Presents a prolongation upwards & outwards behind os magnum, and has four articular facets, one for os magnum, one for 2nd metacarpal bone, and two for 4th. METACARPAL B. OF RING FINGER — Short. Carpal Extremity - Pretty regularly cuboid. Presents five facets for unciform, os magnum, 3rd (two facets), & 5th metacarpal bones. METACARPAL B. OF LITTLE FINGER — The smallest & the shortest but one. Carpal Extremity - Has a prominent tubercle on inner side for extensor carpi ulnaris; carpal facet is saddle-shaped for unciform j only one lateral facet for 4th metacarpal bone. N.B.—The foregoing characters supply the three points requisite to place the bones in position, and therefore to distinguish between right bones and left bones

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. In a Learner's point of view Scientific facts may, the Author thinks, be divided into those which are daily met with by the Student, and which soon become familiar to him, and those which are learned with considerable pains and afterwards easily forgotten, and which require to be constantly recalled to the mind. The Author has endeavoured to deal with the latter class of facts only. What every one knows, who has at all studied Medicine, he has purposely left out. Greater condensation is thus obtained. - To the non-medical reader the Tablets may appear disconnected, and the descriptions they contain (if descriptions they maybe called) may seem dry and naked. The Anthor believes that the Student will easily supply the links, and give life and shape to the skeleton sketches. This book is intended neither for the idle, nor for absolute beginners. The idle will find that it contains more details than they will care to master, and that its brevity demands more mental appli- cation than would be agreeable to any one, whose mind has not been trained to close study. Beginners, however, who mean to work, may, after attending a lecture, or reading up in one of the Standard Authors a region they have just been dissecting, advantageously revise the subject in the Tablets; and these partial revisions will be found to fix the main points in the mind, and to facilitate the more important revisional effort, which, even the first year's student is usually called upon to make, whenever his lecturer has finished describing a part, or he himself has finished dis- eecting one. The more or less advanced Students, who are doing, or have done, their work honestly and con- scientiously, are the ones the Author has had mainly in view. September, 1871.

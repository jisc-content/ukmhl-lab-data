125 ASCENDING VENONS TRUNKS. COMMON ILIAC VEINS — Formed by junction of external & internal iliaea oppo- site sacro-vertebral articulation (some authors say opposite sacro-iliac synchondr- osis). Obliquely upwards, the left one more obliquely than the right, to a little to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae, where they unite to form the inferior cava. RIGHT COMMON ILIAC — Shorter & less oblique than the left one ; lies at first behind & then on outer side of its artery. Receives Tributary Branches: - Llio-Lumbar, & sometimes Lateral Sacral. LEFT COMMON ILIAC* — Longer & mpre oblique than the right one; lies at first on inner side of its artery, and then passes behind artery of right side. Receives Tributary Branches: - Llio-Liunbar, & sometimes the Lateral <2r» Middk Sacral. - The common iliac veins have no valvos. INFERIOR VENA CAVA — Formed by junction of the two common iliacs a little to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae. Along right side of aorta in front of right lumbar & renal arteries & right crus of dia- phragm, passing in succession behind attached border of mesentery, transverse por- tion of duodenum, pancreas, & portal trunk. Through groove or canal in posterior border of liver, where the hepatic veins open into it. Perforates central or cordiform tendon of diaphragm between its middle & right leaflet?. Enters fibrous bag of pericardium, becomes invested anteriorly by serous layer of same sac, and opens into lower & back part of right auricle near interauricular septum, its opening being guarded by the Eustachian valve. Receives Tributary Branches : - Middle Sacral, Lumbar, Renal, Hepatic, Right Sper- matic, Suprarenal, &■» Lnferior Phrenic, the middle sacral sometimes opening into the left common iliac. 37

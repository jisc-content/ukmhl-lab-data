168 CERVICAL PLEXUS. DEE? BRANCHES — Divided into internal & external. INTERNAL — Are: Communicating - From loop between 1st & 2nd cervical to pneumogastric, hypoglossal & superior cervical ganglion of sympathetic; and also from 3rd & 4th to cord of sympathetic below the ganglion. Muscular - From 1st & 2nd, to recti capitis antici major & minor, and rectus lateralis. Communicans Noni - From 2nd & 3rd. Downwards & forwards across sheath of carotid vessels (sometimes within the sheath, and then either in front of or behind internal jugular vein), and, near middle of neck, forms a loop with descendens noni; from convexity of which loop branches are given off to the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid and omo-hyoid. Phrenic or Int. Respiratory of Sir C. Bell - From 3rd, 4th, and usually also from 5th. , Downwards & inwards in front of scalenus anticus. Between subclavian vein & 1st part of subclavian artery crossing internal mammary, \ and receiving a filament from sympathetic, sometimes another from 5th & 6th cervical nerves, and occasionally on the left side, one from the ansa hypoglossi. Crosses arch of Aorta & pulmonary artery, on the left side. 1 Descends, on the right side, on outer side of right innominate vein & sup. vena cava. | In front of root of lung & along side of pericardium to diaphragm, and divides in 1 to branches which perforate the diaphragm and supply it by its under surface. \ Both nerves give off twigs to the pericardium & pleura, and join with the phrenic plexus of the sympathetic, the right nerve sending also a few filaments to the diaphragmatic ganglion. EXTERNAL -Are: Communicating - Join spinal accessory in substance of sterno-mastoid, in occipital triangle, & beneath trapezius. Muscular - To sterno-mastoid (from 2nd nerve), levator anguli scapulas (from 3rd), scale- nus medius & trapezius (from 3rd & 4th)

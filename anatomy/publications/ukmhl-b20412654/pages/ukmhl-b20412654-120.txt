108 PARTS CONCERNED in LATERAL LITHOTOMY. Parts to be divided: - 1. Integument^ superficial fascia, inferior hoetnorrhoidal vessels &* nerve ; 2. Posterior fibres of accelerator urince &* transversus perincei muscles; probably also the transverse perineal artery and superficial perinceal vessels & nerves. 3. Deep perineal fascia, left deep transversus perincei muscle dr» posterior fibres of com- pressor uretkree ; the anterior fibres of levator am; 4>. Membranous &* prostatic portions of urethra, and part of prostate gland. Parts to be avoided: - 1. The bulb and its artery are endangered if incision is begun too far forwards; - if the artery arises further back than usual it is exposed to be divided whatever care be taken; 2. The rectum is endangered if incision is begun too far iij wards; 3. The pudic artery, if incision is carried too far outwards ; 4. Rntire breadth of prostate with prostatic veins 6° accessory pudic artery, if the latter exist, may be divided if incision into the deep parts is carried too far baok* wards, and the urine may then become infiltrated between the bladder & rectum.

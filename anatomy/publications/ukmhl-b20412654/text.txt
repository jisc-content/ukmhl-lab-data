FOURTH EDITION, OR SELECTION OE THE TABLETS BELIEVED TO BE MOST USEFUL TO STUDENTS GENERALLY. " The schemes of any of the arts or sciences may be analysed in a sort of skeleton, and represented upon tables, with the various dependencies and connections of the several parts and subjects that belong to them; and the frequent review of these abstracts and epitomes would tend much to imprint them on the brain, when they have been once well learned; this would keep those learned traces always open, and assist the weakness of a labouring memory."

Fourteen years' experience in the use of the Tablets of Anatomy has shown that, from ihe point of view of their utility to Students, the Tablets may be divided into two classes:— I. —Those—the majority,—which may be considered useful to most Students. II. —Those which are of use mainly to such as are preparing for the higher examinations. The Tablets which may be fairly considered to come within Class L, have alone beea introduced into this "Fourth Edition, or selection of the Tablets believed to be most useful to Students generally." The bulk and price of the work have therefore been considerably reduced. It has also been thought desirable to group the Tablets according to the several regions of the body, so that the book may become a companion to the sevei^al Dissectors' Manuals. Special facilities have furtherjbeen provided for the easy division of the book into parts or segments of a convenient size for carrying in the coat pocket. To this effect, the several groups of subjects, Posterior Triangle of the Neck, Anterior Triangle of the Neck, Orbit, etc., have each been arranged in what bookbinders cali a "section"; and if the book be opened somewhat forcibly between the front or title page of one section, and the last page of th@ preceding section, it will easily be divided at this point by simply cutting the bookbinder's threads or tapes. And each section will be found to contain a complete subject, to form a synopsis, so to speak, of one of the ordinary classes given by the Author in his private Anatomical School, and to constitute a pamphlet which, folded in two, will bear carrying about without falling to pieces. The advantages of a small book are thus added to some extent to those of a book of Ordinary size. This arrangement has involved, however, some repetitions and a few omissions, the latter generally unimportant, it is believed, and mostly remedied in the Appendix. The Tablets coming within Class II., i.e., those of use mainly to such as are preparing for the higher examinations, will be published separately. They will include all the " Special Dissections," etc. The minute Anatomy, which is now generally taken under the head of Physiology, and such subjects as bave mainly reference to minute anatomy, such as the ear, the eye, etc., have been removed from this edition. It is intended, however, that the Tablets of Physiology and Histology, thoroughly revised and brought up to date, shall be published in the same form as the present; and these publications will embody notes and explanations intended to facilitate the repetition by the student of the great bnlk of the practical exercises in Physiology by Professors Burdon-Sanderson, Foster & Langley, and other authors, which are now frequently demonstrated in the Author's private classes. 4.0, BRUN3WICK SQUARE, May, 1885.PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. In a Learner's point of view Scientific facts may, the Author thinks, be divided into those which are daily met with by the Student, and which soon become familiar to him, and those which are learned with considerable pains and afterwards easily forgotten, and which require to be constantly recalled to the mind. The Author has endeavoured to deal with the latter class of facts only. What every one knows, who has at all studied Medicine, he has purposely left out. Greater condensation is thus obtained. - To the non-medical reader the Tablets may appear disconnected, and the descriptions they contain (if descriptions they maybe called) may seem dry and naked. The Anthor believes that the Student will easily supply the links, and give life and shape to the skeleton sketches. This book is intended neither for the idle, nor for absolute beginners. The idle will find that it contains more details than they will care to master, and that its brevity demands more mental appli- cation than would be agreeable to any one, whose mind has not been trained to close study. Beginners, however, who mean to work, may, after attending a lecture, or reading up in one of the Standard Authors a region they have just been dissecting, advantageously revise the subject in the Tablets; and these partial revisions will be found to fix the main points in the mind, and to facilitate the more important revisional effort, which, even the first year's student is usually called upon to make, whenever his lecturer has finished describing a part, or he himself has finished dis- eecting one. The more or less advanced Students, who are doing, or have done, their work honestly and con- scientiously, are the ones the Author has had mainly in view. September, 1871.TABLE OF CONTENTS. BONES.

Present for examination: - Body - Forms a shox*t column, which presents: Surface - Convex from side to side, concave from above downwards; presents numerous small vascular foramina. Pqst. Surface - Concave from side to side, flat from above downwards; presents one or more irregular apertures for exit of venae basis vertebrae & Under Surfaces - Rough & slightly concave, and surrounded by a pro- minent rim. Pedicles - J°in the body to the laminae. They are constricted, and their constriction gives rise to the Notches - Which latter, by the superposition of the vertebras, form the intervertebral fora* mina. Laminse - Broad & flat, rough above & below for the ligamenta subflava; bound posteriorly Foramen - Which, by the superposition of the vertebrae, forms the spinal canal. Spinous process -Projects backwards from the point of junction of the lamina©. Transverse processes - Two. Project outwards from the sides of the arch. Articular processes - Pour. Projec t upwards & downwards from the point of junction the pedicles with the laminae. The superior ones look backwards, the inferior ones look forwards ]sjt But little, which would bo applicable to each of the three groups of vertebrae, can, it is believed, be added to this description.3 THE THREE GROUPS of VERTEBRiE. CERVICAL VERTEBRiE — The smallest. Present: - BODY — Small, broad from side to side. Presents: - •a Upper Surface - Concave from side to side, and rounded off anteriorly. Under Surface - Convex from side to side, and prolonged downwards anteriorly. Anterior Surface - Situated therefore on a lower level than the posterior. PEDICLES —Arise from lower part of body, and of the two NOTCHES — The superior ones are the deepest, and some what the narrowest. LAMINAE — Long and narrow. FORAMEN —Large and triangular. SPINOUS PROCESS — Projects horizontally backwards, and is short, bifid, & grooved inferiorly. TRANSVERSE PROCESSES — Short, bifid, grooved superiorly, perforated at their base for passage of vertebral artery & vein, and situated on the outer side of the pedicles; in front of the articular processes. The existence of the foramen at the base ot the cervical transverse pro- cesses, and the situation of these processes on the outer side of the pedicles, are owing to their being formed of two roots, which roots correspond, the anterior one to the transverse processes properly so-called, the posterior one to the ribs. ARTICULAR PROCESSES — Form a small vertical column. The superior ones look upwards & backwards, the inferior ones look downwards & forwards. DORSAL VERTEBRiE — Intermediate in size. Present: - BODY — Heart-shaped, thicker behind than in front, and has two demi-facets on each side, which facets articulate with the heads of the ribs. PEDICLES —Arise from upper part of body, and of the two NOTCHES —The inferior ones are the deepest and broadest. LAMINA — Short & broad. FORAMEN — Small & round. SPINOUS PROCESS — Long, triangular, oblique, and ends in a single tubercle. TRANSVERSE PROCESSES — Long, thick, obliquely directed outwards & backwards, and situated behind the articular processes 6° the pedicles. Their extremity is enlarged, and presents in front an articular facet for tubercle of correspond- ing rib. \ From the back of the extremity of the few lower dorsal transverse proces. ses arise three tubercles, termed external, inferior, & superior, which tubercles correspond respectively to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrse, and to the accessory & mammillai'y tubercles found, the former on the back of the transverse processes, the latter on the back of the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrse. ARTICULAR PROCESSES — Nearly vertical. The superior ones look backwards & outwards, the inferior ones look forwards & inwards. LUMBAR VERTEBRiE — The largest. Present: - BODY — Large, broadest from side to side, rather thicker in front than behind. PEDICLES — Thick : arise from upper part of body, and of the two NOTCHES — The inferior ones are the deepest & broadest. LAMINA — Short, broad & thick. FORAMEN — Triangular, larger than in the dorsal region, smaller than in the cervical. SP1NOCS PROCESS — Thick, quadrilateral, and ends in a rough vertical border. TRANSVERSE PROCESSES — Long, slender, directed transversely outwards, and situated in front of the articular processes, but behind the pedicles, aud in a line with the external tubercles of the lower dorsal transverse processes, to which they correspond. On the back of each, near its base, is a small tubercle the accessory tubercle, which points downwards & inwards, and which corresponds to the inferior tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse processes. ARTICULAR PROCESSES — Thick, strong & vertical. The superior ones are concave, look backwards & inwards, and are farther apart than the inferior ones, which they embrace. The inferior ones are convex, look forwards & outwards, and are nearer to each other than are the superior ones. On the back of each superior articular process is a small tubercle, the mammillary tubercle, which corresponds to the superior tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse processes.THE THREE GROUPS COMPARED SERIATIM.

Dorsal - Long, thick, obliquely directed outwards & backwards, and situated behind the articular processes 6° the pedicles. Their extremity is enlarged, and presents in front an articular facet for tubercle of corresponding rib. From the back of the extremity of the few lower dorsal transverse proces- ses arise three tubercles, termed external, inferior, & superior, which tubercles correspond respectively to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and to the accessory & mammillary tubercles found, the former on the back of the transverse processes, the latter on the back of the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebras. Lumbar - Long, slender, directed transversely outwards, and situated in front of the articular processes, but behind the pedicles, and in a line with the externaL tubercles of the lower dorsal transverse processes, to which they correspond. On the back of each, near its base, is a small tubercle the accessory tubercle, which points downwards & inwards, and which corresponds to the inferior tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse processes. Articular Processes — Cervical - Form a small vertical column. The superior ones look upwards & back- wards, the inferior ones look downwards & forwards. Dorsal - Nearly vertical. The superior ones look backwards & outwards, the inferior ones look forwards & inwards. Lumbar - Thick, strong & vertical. The superior ones are concave, look baokwards & i iwards, and are farther apart than the inferior ones, which they embrace. The inferior ones are convex, look forwards & outwards, and are nearer to each other than are the superior ones. On the back of each superior lumbar articular process is a small tubercle, the mammillary tubercle, which corresponds to the superior tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse procssse*.5 PECULIAR VERTEBRAE.

THE ATLAS Presents anterior & posterior arches, foramen, and lateral masses. ANTERIOR ARCH - Presents: Anterior Surf. - Convex, in centre of which is a tubercle for superior oblique portion of longus colli, and for superficial anterior occipito-atloid & superficial anterior atlo-axoid ligaments. Posterior Surf. - Concave, in centre of which is an oval facet, which articulates with odontoid process of axis. Upper & Lower Borders - For deep anterior occipito-atloid & deep anterior atlo» axoid ligaments. POSTERIOR ARCH — Presents just behind the lateral masses the Grooves representing the superior &* inferior intervertebral notches. - Th« superior grooves, which are the deepest and are sometimes con- verted into complete foramina, transmit the vertebral artery & the suboccipital nerve.

It ends posteriorly in a tubercle for rectus capitis posticus minor. FORAMEN —Large, and divided by transverse ligament (transverse portion of crucial liga- ment) into a posterior part, the largest, for spinal cord & its membranes, and an anterior part, the smallest, which receives the odontoid process of the axis. LATERAL MASSES — Short & thick columns of bone, which present internally, externally, above & below, a tubercle for the transverse ligament; Transverse Process - Large, not bifid nor grooved superiorly, perforated at its base by a very large foramen ; Sup. Articular Surf. — Large, oval, concave, converging towards its fellow anteriorly, and looking upwards, inwards & slightly backwards. Inf. Articular Surf. - Rather smaller, flat, circular, and looking downwards & inwards. THE AXIS Presents the following peculiarities Body - A good deal thicker in front than behind.

Seven Stei-nal or True - Connected to the sternum by their costal cartil- ages ; these increase in length from above downwards. Five False or Asternal - Of which the three first are connected by their car- tilages to the cartilage of the rib above, while the two last, or floating ribs, are entirely disconnected in front. The asternal or false ribs decrease in length from above downwards. The breadth of the ribs decreases from the 1st to the last j so does also the width of the corresponding intercostal spaces. The degree of obliquity of the ribs increases from the 1st to the 9th, and decreases from the 9th to the 12th. It is most marked between the head & the posterior angle. The ribs are both curved & ttuisted upon themselves. The curve of the ribs is most marked in the neighbourhood of the posterior angle. The twist is such that the outer sur- face of the shaft looks slightly downwards behind & slightly upwards in front, and that, if the lower border of the shaft be placed upon a flat horizontal surface from the anterior extremity of the bone to the posterior angle, the part of the bone behind the angle, will be found to pass upwards & in- wards.

Extensor Jndicis - Posterior surface below foregoing.56 THE SHOULDEE-JOJNT. Is an enarthrodial articulation, though not a typical one; for the glenoid cavity of the scapula is, in comparison with the head of the humerus, remarkably small & shallow, and there is little more than a mere apposition between the two bones. Considerable mobility is thus provided for. Displacement is, on the other hand, prevented to a great extent by thel presence of the acromion & coracoid processes & coraco-acromial ligament. — The articular cartilage is thickest in the centre, on the head of tb„e humerus, thickest at the periphery, on the glenoid cavity. LIGAMENTS: Capsular - From Neck of scapula round margin of glenoid cavity to Anatomical neck of humerus, extending farthest down humerus along its inner aspeot. This capsule is thicker above than below. It is strengthened by the coraco- humeral ligament externally, by the tendons of the supra- & infraspinatus & teres minor behind, and by that of the subscapularis in front. It has two, sometimes three openings, through which the synovial mem- brane is prolonged upon the tendons of the subscapularis & biceps, and sometimes upon that of the infraspinatus. The tendon of the long head of the biceps per- forates the lower part of the capsule, and becomes surrounded, within the joint, by a complete sheath of synovial membrane. It is remarkably loose, and, when the muscles are cut, it admits of the bones being separated more than an inch. The bones are therefore kept in apposition less by the ligaments themselves than by muscular action & atmospheric pressure. CoraCO-h.umeral; or Accessory - Strong fiat band intimately blended with the capsule, and extending obliquely from Root 6° outer border of coracoid process to Front of great tuberosity of humerus. Glenoid - Would be better described as an extension of the glenoid cavity than as a liga- ment, for, unlike the cotyloid ligament of the hip-joint, it does not assist in keeping the bones together. It is a fibro.cartilaginous ring triangular on section; its thickest portion is attached to the circumference of the glenoid cavity, and its sharp edge is free. It is continuous above with the tendon of the long head of the biceps, by the bifurcation of which it is partly formed. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE — Is prolonged through the above mentioned openings in the capsule Upon the tendon of the biceps, in the shape of a complete sheath, which allows the tendon to traverse the articular cavity without being contained therein; Upon the tendon of the subscapularis in the shape of a pouch of variable size comprised between the tendon & the subscapular fossa ; and sometimes Vfin the tendon of the infraspinatus in. a similar manner; an independent bursa exist- ing at other times between the muscle & the infraspinou3 fossa. - An independent bursa exists between the upper part of the capsule & the coraco-acromial ligament & deltoid. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY —From the circumflex & supra-scapular vessels & nerve3. MOVEMENTS — The shoulder joint is the freest of all the joints of the body, and admits of movement in every direction. The acromion & coracoid processes & the coraco- acromial ligament prevent displacement upwards of the head of the humerus, and limit, unless the scapula be displaced, the elevation of the arm to about the horizontal position.57 THE ELBOW-JOINT. Is a ginglymoid articulation between the trochlea & the radial tuberosity or capitellum oi the humerus, on the one hand, and, on the other, the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna & the cup.shaped depression on the head of the radius. - The articular surfaces of the radius & ulna are continuous with those of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. LIGAMENTS - Are: Anterior - Broad & pretty thick layer of superficial oblique & deeper vertical fibres extending from Inner condyle &° front of humerus just above coronoid fossa to Orbicular Iigamentof radius <S° under surface of coronoid process of ulna, - to which vertical & oblique fibres a few transverse ones are added. Posterior - Thin & membranous,• consists of a few irregular fibres mainly trans- verse, which connect Apex &> sides of olecranon process to Margin of olecranon fossa. External Lateral - Thick, strong,triangular, shorter & narrower than the internal; from External condyle to Orbicular ligament of radius (Sr8 outer border of ulna. Internal Lateral - Thick, strong, triangular; longer & broader than foregoing, and divided into anterior & posterior portions extending respectively from Front, and from lower 6° back part of inner condyle, respectively to Inner border of coronoid process, and inner border of olecranon. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE — Lines the coronoid & olecranon fossa?, and dips down be- tween the articular surfaces of the superior radioulnar articulation. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY - From the superior & inferior profunda, & the radial, ulnar & interosseous recurrent arteries, and from the ulnar & musculocutaneous nerves. MOVEMENTS — Flexion & extension only, which are limited by the locking of the coronoid & olecranon processes in their respective fossae. - The inner border of the trochlea descending lower than the outer one, the axis of rotation is oblique downwards & inwards; the path of motion lies, therefore, in a plane, oblique downwards & out- wards, which circumstance, as is remarked by Cruveilhier, brings the hand during flexion naturally and without effort towards the mouth.58 EADIO-ULNAE ARTICULATIONS. Three In number, superior, middle, & inferior, the middle one consisting merely of two ligamen ts, the interosseous & the oblique or round. SUPERIOR RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION - Lateral ginglymus or diarthrosia rotatorius between circumference of head of radius, on the one hand, and lesser sig- moid cavity & inner surface of orbicular ligament of radius, on the other, the lesser sigmoid cavity corresponding to the broad inner part, and the orbicular ligament to the narrow outer part of the radial articular surface. - The only ligament is the Orbicular Ligament ~ Strong flat band, the four-fifths of a ring, which extends, round head & upper part of neck of radius, from Anterior extremity to Posterior extremity of lesser sigmoid cavity oftdna. The circumference of its lower border is narrower than that of its upper border, so that the head of the radius is maintained by it both against the ulna & against the capitellum of the humerus. Its inner surface is lined by the synovial membrane, and forms part of the articular surfaces of the joint. Its outer surface gives attachment to external lateral ligament of elbow-joint and to supinator brevis muscle. MIDDLE RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION. Interosseous Ligament - Strong aponeurotic plane of fibres which pass obliquely downwards & inwards between Contiguous borders of radius & ulna.-It is broadest towards middle, perforated interiorly for anterior interosseous vessels, and deficient above from about an inch below tubercle of radius, thus leaving for posterior interosseous vessels an opening bounded superiorly by the Oblique or Round Ligament - Narrow fasciculus oblique downwards & out- wards from Coronoidprocess to Radius half an inch below bicipital tuberosity. INFERIOR RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATOR — Lateral ginglymus or diarthrosia rotatorius between head of ulna & sigmoid cavity of radius, to which is added an arthrodia between under surface of head of ulna & the triangular fibio-cartilage of the articulation. - The ligaments are:' Ant. Radioulnar - Narrow band from Anterior extremity of sigmoid cavity to Front of head of ulna. Post. Radio-Ulnar - Narrow band from Posterior extremity of sigmoid cavity to Back of head of ulna. Triangular Fibro-Cartilage - The principal band of union, triangular, from Lower margin of sigmoid cavity of radius to Depression at root of styloid process of ulna. Its upper & under surfaces are lined respectively with the synovial mem- branes of the inferior radio-ulnar & radio-carpal articulations, and they come in contact, the one with the head of the ulna, the other with the cunei- form bone. Its margins are blended with the surrounding ligaments. It is thinnest in the centre, and sometimes perforated; the two synovial mem- branes above mentioned are then continuous with each other. Synovial Membrane - Is very loose, and is termed the membrana sacciformis. It extends between the triangular fibro-cartilage & the head of the ulna, and becomes continuous, when the former is perforated, with the synovial mem- brane of the wrist-joint.59 THE WRIST JOINT. Is a condyloid articulation. ARTICULAR SURFACES: The Condyle - Is formed by three bones, the scaphoid, semilunar, & cuneiform. The Receiving Cavity - Is formed by the under surface of the radius & by the trian- gular fibro-cartilage of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. - The under sur- face of the radius is divided by a linear elevation into two portions, the outer triangular, the inner quadrilateral, which portions correspond respectively to the scaphoid and the semilunar; the cuneiform articulates with the under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage. LIGAMENTS: External Lateral - Short strong band, from Apex of styloid process of radius to Outer side of scaphoid &> trapezium, &> anterior annular ligament of carpus. Internal Lateral - Round cord, from Apex of styloid process of ulna to Cuneiform &1 pisiform bones, & anterior annular ligament. Anterior -Strong & broad membrane, from Front of head of ulna, anterior margin of radius &> its styloid process to Scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, 6° slightly to os magnum. Posterior - Thinner, from Posterior margin of radius to Scaphoid, semilunar 6° cuneiform. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — Anterior & posterior carpal branches cf radial & ulnar, anterior & posterior interosseous arteries, ascending branches of deep palmar arch. - Ulnar nerve. MOVEMENTS — All but rotation.60 FASCIiE & SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES of the HAND & WRIST. FASCIiE — Are rather ligaments than fasciae proper, and are therefore described here.

Central Portion - Thick, strong, triangular; firmly adherent to integument; covers superficial palmar arch, flexor tendons, & median & ulnar nerves, and gives origin internally to palmaris brevis. It is narrow above, where it receives expanded tendon of palmaris longus, and is attached to anterior annular ligament; and broad below, where it divides into four slips bound together by transverse fibres. Each slip subdivides into two processes, which processes embrace the flexor tendons, and become attached to bases of first phalanges & glenoid ligaments. Between the slips are seen the palmar interosseous & digital arteries, the terminal branches of the median & ulnar nerves, & the tendons of the lumbricales. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES — Are articular & tendinous.

Passes down front & inner side of thigh, being at first at a distance from, and then close to, the shaft of the bone. Terminates at junction of middle and lower thirds of thigh, becoming popliteal artery in opening in lower part of adductor magnus. - Some Authors describe a common femoral artery descending as low down as the origin of the deep femoral, the main trunk below this branch being called the superficial femoral. Its direotion is marked by a line drawn from midway between antero-superior spine of ilium and symphysis pubis to inner side of inner condyle of femur.

ARTICULAR SURFACES: Acetabulum - Deep, hemispherical, further deepened in the fresh condition by the cotyloid & transverse ligaments. Looks downwards, outwards & forwards. Is divided into : Incomplete Articular King - Broadest above & behind, and deficient below & in front. Central Non.Articular Depression - Continuous with cotyloid notch; lodges a mass of fat, which forms a bed for the round ligament. Head Of Femur - Forms nearly two-thirds of a sphere, and, in the normal position of the limb, looks upwards, inwards & forwards. It presents a little below & behind its centre a small circular depression for attachment ©f ligamentum teres; near this depression the cartilage is thicker than elsewhere. LIGAMENTS -Are:- Capsular - Short & thick, especially above & in front; thinner & looser below & behind; some- times perforated beneath psoas. - It extends from Outer lip of margin of acetabuhim within two or three lines of the cotyloid ligament, and, opposite the cotyloid notch, from transverse ligament 6° edge of obturator foramen to Anterior intertrochanteric line in front; base of neck of femur, above; and, behind, to back of neck of femur, within about half an inch from lesser trochanter 6° posterior intertrochanteric line. Ilio-Femoral or Accessory - -A- thickened band closely connected with front of capsule, which extends obliquely from Anterior inferior spine of ilium to Loiver part of anterior intertrochanteric line. There are also several other accessory bands, viz., one on the outer side of the ilio-femoral termed the Ilio-trochanteric, one on the inner side of the ilio-femoral termed the Pubo-femoral; also a transverse band at the back of the joint. Round Ligament or Ligamentum Teres - Interarticular band about an inch long and of very variable strength & thickness, attached, on the one hand, to Depression a little below & behind centre of head of femur, and on the other hand, dividing into two fasciculi, to Margins of cotyloid notch; the two fasciculi blending with the transverse ligament. It conveys a lew vessels to head of femur. Cotyloid - Incomplete fibrocartilaginous ring triangular on section, presenting a base attached to margin of acetabulum, and a sharp free edge which closely embraces head of femur. It is thickest above & behind, and deficient opposite the cotyloid notch, where it is con. tinued into the transverse ligament. It consists of closely interlaced oblique fibres arising from the different points of the rim of the bone. Tran sverse - Strong flattened band, a continuation of the foregoing, which extends from one side of the cotyloid notch to the other, transforming it into a complete foramen. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE — Invests whole of anterior surface & greater part of posterior sur- face of neck of femur, cotyloid ligament, mass of fat at bottom of acetabulum, & ligamentum teres. - It communicates sometimes through a small opening in the capsule with the bursa beneath psoas & iliacus. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — From obturator, sciatic & internal circumflex arteries, and from great sciatic, obturator & accessory obturator nerves. MOVEMENTS — Are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation & circumduction. - Flexion is freer then extension: the thigh can be brought forwards till it touches the ab- domen, but it cannot be carried backwards to anything like the same extent. Flexion, in fact, is scarcely interfered with by the posterior part of the capsule, which is thin & loose; exten- sion, on the contary, is soon arrested by the ilio-femoral ligament and by the anterior part of the capsule, which is short & thick. - Of the two lateral movements abduction is the freest; it is checked by the action of tho pubo-femoral band. Adduction is checked mainly by the two limbs coming in contact, bufc also partly by the action of the ilio-trochanteric band. When however flexion & adduction are combined, so that one limb passes in front of the other, the double movement may bo carried very far; it is at last arrested, by the action of the round ligament. The round liga- ment is also tensed when flexion & abduction are combined and carried to a considerable extent, and when the limb is rotated outwards. Rotation inwards is freer than rotation outwards (rotation being measured from the inter- mediate position which the foot normally occupies in standing) ; this is partly due to the greater laxity of the capsule behind than in front, and partly also to the direction forwards both of the head of the femur & of the acetabulum. Rotation takes place round an imaginary line extending from the head of the fomur to the centre of the knee-joint. - Circumduction, as all other movements generally, is much less free in the hip than in the sholder-joint. The weight of the limb at the hip-joint is normally supported by atmospheric pressure • - In consequence of the complete exclusion of air from the joint through the accurate adapta- tion of the cotyloid & transverse ligaments to the head of the femur, the latter is firmly re- tained in the acetabulum even after all the soft parts around the joint have been divided; if air be allowed to penetrate into the joint through a perforation of the acetabulum from within, tie limb will immediately drop.KNEE-JOINT—3rd Tablet. LIGAMENTS - Are the: - Anterior Ligament or Ligamentum Patellae - strong flat band about three inches long, a continuation of tendon of rectus femoris, which extends from Apex of patella 6° rough depression below its articular surface to Lozver part of tubercle of tibia, being separated from upper part of the tubercle by a small bursa. - It is separated from the synovial membrane of the knee- joint by a considerable mass of adipose tissue. Posterior Ligament - Consists of three portions (Cruveilhier, Gray) : - Central Portion or Ligamentum Posticum Winslowii (The only portion described either by Winslovv, or by Heath, Quain, & many modern Authors) - Broad flat band partly derived from tendon of semimembranosus, and which extends obliquely from Back part of inner tuberosity of tibia to Upper &? back part of outer condyle of femur. Two Lateral Portions (Capsule Fibreuse des Condyles, Cruveilhier) - Closely connec ted with tendons of gastrocnemius, popliteus, plantaris, and formed chiefly of vertical fibres extending from Condyles just above their articular surfaces to Back of head of tibia. - These lateral portions are looked upon by many anatomists as a part of the capsular ligament. Internal Lateral Ligament - Broad flat band from Back part of inner tuberosity of femur to Inner tuberosity &> upper part of inner surface of shaft of tibia. - Covers anterior portion of tendon of semimembranosus & inferior internal articular vessels, and is covered by tendons of sartorius, gracilis & semitendinosus, a bursa being interposed. External Lateral Ligament - Consists of two portions: - Long External Lateral Ligament - Strong rounded cord from Back part of outer tuberosity of femur to Outer part of head of fibula. - It is embraced by the two fasciculi into which the ten* don of the biceps divides, and beneath it pass tendon of popliteus & inferior external articular vessels. Short External Lateral Ligament-Accessory & somewhat variable bundle of fibres intimately blended with capsule, lying behind foregoing & on outer side of tendon of popliteus, and extending from Lower & back part of outer tuberosity of femur to Apex of styloid process of fibula. Capsular Ligament - Lies in contact with the synovial membrane, and beneath the other ligaments, which it binds together. It is strengthened by expansions from the fascia lata and from the vasti, biceps, sartorius & semimembranosus; the ex- pansions from the fascia lata & the vasti forming, on eit'ier side of the patella, the so-called lateral patellar ligaments. It is attached to Femur just above the articular surfacest Upper border sides of patella, Margins of head of tibia 6° semilunar fibro-cartilages. Crucial Ligaments - Two, project into the interior of the joint from behind, and cross each other obliquely like the bars of an X. Anterior Crucial Ligament - The most oblique & somewhat the smaller, from Inner part of rough triangular depression in front of spine of tibia between points of attach- ment of anterior extremities of both semilunar fibro-cartilages, and partly also from anterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage itself to Inner &° back part of outer condyle of femur. Posterior Crucial Ligament - The thickest & strongest. Nearly vertically from Back part of rough depression behind spine of tibia, behind points of attachment of posterior extremities of both semilunar fibro-cartilages, and partly from posterior extremity of external semilunar fibro-cartilage itself to Anterior 6° outer part of inner condyle of femur 6° front of intercondvloid notch* Transverse & Coronary Ligaments - Ligamentum Mueosum & Ligamenta Alaria -95 THE ANKLE-JOINT. Is a ginglymoid articulation ARTICULAR SURFACES: - The Trochlea - Is formed by the Tipper articular surface & the two lateral facets of the astragalus. The upper articular surface is broadest in front, convex from before backwards, & slightly concave from side to side; its outer border is a little longer than the inner one, and is slightly curved inwards posteriorly. Of the two lateral facets, the external one is the largest. The Receiving Cavity - Is formed by the under surface of the lower extremity of the tibia, and by the outer & inner surfaces respectively of the internal & external malleoli. The under surface of the lower extremity of the tibia is quadrilateral, broadest in front, concave from before backwards, and marked by a slight antero- posterior elevation separating two shallow lateral depressions. Of the articular facets of the two malleoli, that of the outer one is the largest. LIGAMENTS - Are:- Anterior & Posterior - Very thin, especially the posterior one, and consisting merely of a few scattered fibres extending between the tibia & the astragalus at the mar- gin of their articular surfaces. - The fibres of the posterior ligament are mainly transverse. Internal Lateral - Consists of two layers: - Superficial Layer, or Deltoid Ligament - Strong triangular band, which radiates from Apex and anterior 6° posterior borders of internal malleolus to Inner part of scaphoid 6° inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament; lesser process ofos calcis ; and back part of inner surface of astragalus. Deep Layer (Cruveilhier, Gray) - Short thick vertical band from Apex of internal malleolus to Inner surface of astragalus below its articular facet. External Lateral - Consists of three separate fasciculi: - Anterior Fasciculus - Short, thick, nearly horizontally from Anterior border of external malleolus to Astragalus in front of its external a?-ticular facet. Middle Fasciculus - Longer, rounded, from Apex of external malleolus to Middle of outer surface of os calcis. Posterior Fasciculus - The strongest, deeply situated ; nearly horizontally from Depression at inner &> back part of external malleolus to Astragalus behind its external articular facet as far as groove for flexor longus polluis. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE - Communicates with that of the inferior tibio.fibular articulation. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — From the malleolar branches of the anterior tibial and the termination of the anterior peroneal, and from the anterior tibial nerve. MOVEMENTS — Are flexion & extension with a slight amount of lateral mobility in the ex- tended position. - In the flexed position the wide anterior part of the trochlea lies in the narrow posterior part of the receiving cavity, and the posterior fibres of tha lateral ligaments are on the stretch ; all lateral movement is then impossible. In the extended position the narrow postei'ior part of the trochlea lies in the wide anterior part of the receiving cavity, and, the lateral ligaments being relaxed (except in forced extension), a considerable amount of lateral movement is per- mitted: -Adduction is produced by the tibialis anticus, abduction by the peronei. In forced extension, however, the anterior fibres of the lateral ligaments become tensed, and movement from side to side is again prohibited. — Forced extension fs accompanied by a slight amount of adduction in consequence of the outer border of the trochlea being a little longer than the inner one and slightly curved inwards posteriorly.96 FASCIAE & SYNOVIAL MEMBEANES of the TAKSUS. FASCIAE — Are rather ligaments than fasoiss proper, and are therefore described here. Anterior7 Annular Ligament - Consists of two portions connected by a thin inter- vening layer of fascia. Superior or Vertical Portion - Of considerable breadth & continuous super- iorly with deep fascia of leg. It extends from lower part of anterior border of tibia to lower part of anterior border of fibula.

Is a broad triangular depression Situated at upper, inner, & front part of thigh; Bounded by Poupart's ligament, sartorius & adductor longua; Contimced downwards 6° inwards into a superficial furrow, which marka position ot femoral artery in Hunter's canal Its floor is formed from without inwards by iliacus, psoas, pectineus, & small part of adductor brevis. It contains femoral vessels & anterior crural nerve, and the PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA — These parts are SKIN — Thin, freely movable, more or less studded with hairs at upper & inner part. SUPERFICIAL FASCIA — Divided into two layers by superficial vessels & nerves & inguinal lymphatic gland*. Superficial Layer - Thick, areolar, contains a large amount of fat, and is continuous with subcutaneous tissue of surrounding regions; is rather thinner & less loaded with fat towards lower part of triangle. DEEP LAYER - Thin & membranous. Adherent superiorly to Poupart's ligament. Stretches over saphenous opening under the name of "cribriform fascia" which fascia is per- forated by internal saphenous vein & by numerous smaller blood & lymphatic vessel*, and is attached firmly to outer margin of the opening, & slightly to the inner margin. Superficial Vessels & Nerves and Lymphatic Glands - Are the: Internal saphenous vein ; Superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, superficial externalprudic arterieswith tlie corresponding veins, which latter open mto internal saphenous near its termination; Ilioinguinal, crural branch of genito-crural, &= external cutaneous nerves. Lymphatic glands - Form two groups. Those of the Superior or abdominal group - Are the smaller, and are placed transversely near Poupart's ligament; - they receive lymphatics of perns, scrotum, perinacum, lower part of abdomen & buttock; - those of the Inferior or femoral group - Are the larger, and are vertically disposed round upper part of saphenous vein ; - they receive the lymphatics of lower limb. DEEP FASCIA or FASCIA LATA — Dense, fibrous. Presents the saphenous opening, for easier description of which it is usually divided into two portions, the iliac & the pubic. ILIAC Portion - The thicker. Attached to crest of ilium, Poupart's ligament & spine of pubes. Is reflected dowmvards & outwards from this latter point, first bounding the superiof angle, or superior cornu of the opening, then forming its outer margin. This outer margin is the falciform process of Burns; its upper part is often called Hey's femoral ligament. Superiorly this margin overlies the sheath of the femoral vessels. Infer- iorly it becomes continuous with pubic portion of the fascia lata by a well defined curved border, which forms the inferior angle, or inferior comu of the opening. Pubic Portion - Much thinner. Is attached to pubic arch at upper and inner part of thigh, and is continuous with iliac portion opposite lower cornu of saphenous opening. Prom this point it is prolonged upwards & outwards behind femoral sheath & in front of pectineus, and becomes attached to ilio-pectineal line. Saphenous Opening - Is formed therefore by the slitting of the fascia lata & by the folding of the two sides of the slit one over the other. It is oval in shape, broad below, narrow above, \\ inches long, \ an inch wide. Its Outer Boundary & its Superior Angle or Cornu, - Which are prominent & well defined, are formed by iliac portion of the fascia lata (falciform process & femoral ligament), which portion, as already stated, passes upwards & inwards in front of the femoral sheath, and becomes attached to Poupart's ligament & spine of pubes. -Its Inner Boundary - Depressed & less clearly defined, is formed by the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which portion, as already stated, passes upwards & outwards behind femoral sheath & in front of pectineus, and becomes attached to the ilio-pectineal line. -Its Inferior Angi S or Cornu - Is formed by the junction of the iliac & pubic portions of the fascia lata just below opening of internal saphenous vein into the femoral FEMORAL SHEATH - Vide next Tablet.99 SCARPA'S TRIANGLE—2nd Tablet. FEMORAL SHEATH — Is a thin tube of fascia divided by two delicate septa into three compartments, of which compartments the outermost contains the femoral artery & the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, the middle one the femoral vein, and the innermost, which is called the femoral canal, some fat & a lymphatic gland. It is expanded superiorly, where it is continuous beneath Poupart's ligament with the fascia? of the abdomen, the fascia transversalis & the fascia iliaca passing down to form it, the former in front of, and the latter behind, the femoral vessels. It is narrow inferiorly, and blenes about two inches below Poupart's ligament with the common areolar sheath of the femoral vessels. Anteriorly it is covered by the iliac portion of the fascia lata (falciform process & femoral ligament), Poupart's ligament, the deep crural arch, and, opposite the saphenous opening, by the cribriform fascia. Posteriorly it rests upon the pubic portion of the fascia lata & the pectineus muscle. Its outer wall is vertical, lies in immediate contact with the artery, and is perforated by the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve. Its inner wall is oblique downwards & outwards from base of Gimbernat's ligament to inner surface of femoral vein. It is pierced superiorly, where it corresponds to the femoral canal, by numerous lymphatic vessels, and, inferiorly, or below the femoral canal, by the internal saphenous vein. FEMORAL CANAL — Is the innermost compartment of the femoral sheath. Or rather it is the na*» row interval comprised, at the upper part of the femoral sheath, between the inner wall of the sheath & the femoral vein; for it can hardly be said to exist as a distinct canal unless the wall of the sheath has been separated from the vein either by dissection or by the pressure of a hernia. - It contains a little fat & a lymphatic gland. It extends from the femoral ring to the upper part of saphenous opening, and measures from i to J an inch in length. It presents four walls & two openings. Anterior Wall - Formed by the fascia transversalis, and supported by Poupart's liga- ment, deep crural arch, & iliac portion of fascia lata (falciform process & femoral ligament); Posterior Wall - Formed by the fascia iliaca; rests upon pubic portion of fascia lata St pectineus muscle; Inner Wall - Formed by junction of fasciae transversalis & iliaca; Outer Wall - Formed by the thin septum on inner side of femoral vein; Superior Opening, or Femoral Ring - Vide below. Inferior, or Saphenous Opening - Vide foregoing Tablet. Femoral Ring - Is the opening of the femoral canal into the abdomen. - Its boundaries are:» In Front - Poupart's ligament and the deep crural arch; Behind - Pubes covered by pectineus muscle, & pubic portion of fascia lata; Internally - Gimbernat's ligament with the triangular ligament, the conjoined tendon, & the deep crural arch. Externally - Femoral vein & the thin septum between it & crural canal. Its relations are as follows: Femoral vein, on outer side; Epigastric artery, crossing upper & outer angle; Spermatic cord or rotind ligament, &■= pubic branch of epigastric above & in front; Obttcrator artery, on inner side, in those rare cases in which the artery presents the double abnormality of arising from the epigastric artery, and of arising from that artery at some distance from its root;-the obturator artery then passes first inwards above the ring, and then downwards into the pelvis behind Gimbernat's ligament. It is nearly circular, about \ an inch wide in the male, a little wider in the female, and is closed by the 6BPTUM CRURALE (J. Cloquet) - A more or less condensed layer of superitoneal areolar tissue adherent to margins of femoral ring, and perforated by numerous apertures for lymphatics. Its upper surface is concave, and separated from the peritoneum by a less condensed layer of the same tissue and sometimes by a lymphatic gland; its under surface is convex & turned towards the femoral canal. The femoral canal & both its openings are constricted by extension & eversion, and relaxed by flexion & inversion of the thigh. COVERINGS OP FEMORAL HERNIA -Are:- FROM WITHIN OUTWARDS : - Peritoneum, subperitoneal areolar tissue (a portion of which, tldckened & caused to assume a membranous appearance by the pressure of the hernia, was described by Sir A. Cooper under the name of fascia propria), septum crurale, crural sheath, crib?1form fascia, superficial fascia, skin. FROM WITHIN OUTWARDS: - Skin, superficial fascia, cribriform fascia, crural sheath, septum crurale^ subperitoneal areolar tissue, peritoneum. The deep seated stricture is to be divided upwards & inwards, in which direction no important vessel is likely to be met with.100 PARTS CONCERNED in INGUINAL HERNIA—1st T. form the inguinal & scrotal regions. From the latter are derived the superficial coverings of large hernl«, which superficial coverings are the same as those of the cord & testis. The former comprises the parts more directly concerned in the occurence of the protrusion, and in the surgical operations thereby required. SCROTAL REGION — Vide " Coverings of Cord & Testis." INGUINAL REGION — Bounded by Poupart's ligament, median line, horizontal line through anterior superior spine of ilium. Presents for examination the following strata, between which the inguinal canal is comprised. Skin - Thin, freely movable, depressed over Poupart's ligament. Superficial Fascia - Continuous with that of thigh, scrotum (dartos) & perinseum. Divided into superficial & deep layers by the superficial vessels & nerves. Superficial Later - Thick, areolar. & more or less distended with fat. Passes over Poupart's ligament without adhering to it. Deep Layer - Thin, membranous, contains no fat; adheres to Poupart's ligament. SUPERFICIAL VESSELS & NERVES — Are: Arteries - Superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, superficial external pudic. Veins - Corresponding ; open into internal saphenous. Lymphatics - Converge towards the Superior or Abdominal set of Inguinal Lymphatic Glands - Three or four, small, obliquely disposed along Poupart's ligament; receive lymphatics of penis, scrotum, perinseum, lower part of abdomen & buttock. Nerves - Ilio-inguinal, & hypogastric branch of ilio-hypogastric. , Aponeurosis of External Oblique - Its fibres are oblique downwards & inwards, and form in succession Poupart's ligament, Gimbernat's ligament, Outer or Inferior pillar of external abdominal ring, Inner or Superior pillar, Superficial part of Linea Alba by decussating with their fellows, and perhaps also, after decussating, the Triangular ligament & the Intercolumnarfibres of opposite side (Vide Abdominal Aponeuroses). Continuous with this stratum of fibres is the Intercolumnar or external sperma- tic fascia, thin, closely adherent to margin of external abdominal ring, and prolonged downward* into a tubular process around cord and testis. Lower Part of Internal Oblique - Thin & pale. Its fibres, which arise from outer half of Poupart's ligament, pass inwards over spermatic cord (or round ligament), and then curve downwards behind it & behind external abdominal ring & Gimbernat's ligament, covering inner two-thirds of Hesselbach's triangle and forming part of conjoined tendon of internal oblique & transversalis, and, becoming tendinous, are inserted over the extent of about half an inch into crest of pubes in front of rectus and into ilio-pectineal line behind Gimbernat's ligament. THE Cremaster Muscle - (Vide " Muscles of the Abdomen " & ". Coverings of the Testicle'% Is connected with lowest fibres of internal oblique, and occasionally also with some of the lowest fibres of transversalis. Lower Part of Transversalis - Also thin & pale. Its fibres, which arise from outer third of Poupart's ligament, take the same course as preceding, and, also becoming tendinous, are inserted with them into crest of pubes and ilio-pectineal line to the extent of about an inch, completing conjoined tendon, Fascia Transversalis - Part of the general layer of fascia which lines the abdominal & pelvic cavities. In the inguinal region it is thick and dense, and presents the following points of interest: - AT CIRCUMFERENCE OF INTERNAL ABDOMINAL RING - It is prolonged into a tubular process of membrane, the infundibuliformfascia, which descends round the cord & testis, forming the fascia propria round the latter. AT LOWER PART OF REGION - It is, - In Front of Femoral Vessels - First thickened into an oblique band adherent to Poupart's ligament & termed the deep crural arch, and then continued downwards beneath Poupart's ligament in front of the vessels to form anterior wall of femoral sheath. Externally to Femoral Vessels - Attached to outer part of Poupart's ligament, and con- tinuous with fascia iliaca. Internally to Femoral Vessels - Attached to crest of pubes & ilio-pectineal line behind conjoined tendon & Gimbernat's ligament That part of the fascia transversalis which lies above Poupart's ligament between outer border Of rectus muscle & epigastric artery (Hesselbach's triangle) is interesting as being the part which forms a covering to direct inguinal hernia. Subperitonial Areolar Tissue - More or less distended with fat. Forms a bed in which the epigastric artery passes upwards & inwards along lower & inner boundaries of internal abdominal ring ; is con- tinued into a loose sheath round the cord. Peritoneum - Presents, before the superficial strata of the abdominal wall have been dissected, the two Inguinal Fossce, internal &> external, which fossae correspond respectively to the external 6s internal abdominal rings, and are separated by an oblique crescentic fold of variable width & prominence, formed by the epigastric & obliterated hypogastric arteries.101 PARTS CONCERNED in INGUINAL HERNIA—2nd T. INGUINAL OR SPERMATIC CANAL Is an oblique passage 1J or 2 inches long situated a little above, and parallel feo, inner half of Poupart's ligament. It gives passage to the spermatic cord or round ligament, and presents for examination its two openings or rings, and its boundaries or walls. External Abdominal Ring - Triangular & oblique downwards & inwards, about 1 inch long & \ inch wide in male but rather smaller in female, bounded later- ally by external & internal pillars, above by the intercolumnar fibres, below by the crest of the pubes. Gives off from its margin the intercolumnar oi external spermatic fascia, which is prolonged into a tubular process around cord & testis (V. Abdominal Aponeuroses). Internal Abdominal Ring - A tubular opening in the fascia transversalis formed by the prolongation of this fascia round the cord & testis (infundibuliform fascia, fascia propria), oval with large diameter directed downwards & out- wards ; situated midway between anterior superior spine of ilium & spine of pubes about \ an inch above Poupart's ligament; bounded above & externally by the lower arched fibres of internal oblique & transversalis, below & inter. nally by epigastric vessels. Boundaries or Walls - Formed by: In Fjjont - Aponeurosis of external oblique along whole length j lowest fibres of internal obliqtte along outer third. Behind - Fascia transversalis along whole length; conjoined tendon of internal oblique & transversalis, & also triangular ligament along inner third. Above - Arched fibres of internal oblique & transversalis. Below -Poupart's ligament blended posteriorly with fascia transversalis Ha102 SURGICAL ANATOMY of INGUINAL HERNIA. Principal points of interest are the coverings of the hernia, and the relations of the neck of the sac & of the seat of stricture. - For the rest see "Inguinal Hernia" among Tablets on Surgery. COVERINGS — Differ in the oblique & direct forms, and are slightly modified also in the congenital & infantile varieties of the former, and in the external & internal varieties of the latter. They are as follows:— OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA Of the Adult From within Outwards : Peritoneum, subserous areolar tissue, infundibuliform fascia% cremasteric fascia, intercolumnar fascia, superficial fascia, skin. From without Inwards : Skin, superficial fascia, intercolumnar fascia, cremasteric fascia, infundibuliform fascia, subserous areolar tissue, peritoneu7>i. Congenital Variety - Descends directly into tunica vaginalis through pouch of peritoneum which accompanies cord & testis into scrotum, and which has abnormally remained unclosed. Its coverings are the same as those of testicle: - Skin, dartos, intercolumnar fascia, cremasteric fascia, fascia propria, tunica vaginalis reflexa. Infantile Variety - Descends into the still patent upper part of the imper~ fectly closed pouch of peritoneum, and becomes more or less completely invested, especially in front, by the posterior part of the tunica vagin- alis reflexa. Its coverings are the same as those of foregoing variety with two additional layers of peritoneum DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA Internal or Common Variety - (Protrudes through inner part of Hessel. bach's triangle, on inner side of obliterated hypogastric artery ). From, within Outwards : Peritoneum, subserous areolar tissue, fascia transversalis (the general f. tr., not the infundibuliform process) conjoined tendon (or not, since it is frequently ruptured instead of being pushed forwards) intercolunmar fascia} superficial fascia, skin. From without Inwards : Skin, superficial fascia, intercolumnar fascia, conjoined tendon (or not), fascia transversalis, subserous areolar tissue peritoneum. External Variety - (Protrudes through outer part of Hesselbach's triangle, on outer side of obliterated hypogastric artery, & externally to the s conjoined tendon) - This exceptional form of inguinal hernia, passes through a considerable portion of the inguinal canal, and greatly re- sembles the oblique hernia both by presenting a certain degree of obliquity and by having very nearly the same coverings; the covering ( derived from the cremasteric fascia is alone rather less complete. RELATIONS OF NECK OF SAC & SEAT OF STRICTURE - The neck of the sac lies IN OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA - On outer side of epigastric artery and in front of spermatic cord, the elements of which may, however, be more or less scattered round the neck of the sac. IN DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA - On inner side of epigastric artery, in from & slightly on inner side of spermatic cord. On account of the uncertainty of the diagnosis between the oblique & direct hernise it is an accepted rule in surgery to divide a deef seated stricture directly upwards from middle of upper margin Oj constricting ring, that is to say in the direction of the epigastric vessels103 THE ISCHIORECTAL REGION. Corresponds to the portion of outlet of pelvis situated behind a line drawn from front part of ono tuber ischii to that of the other. It is bounded in front by above mentioned line ; its apex is at point of coccyx; its sides are formed by tuberosities of ischium, great sacro-sciatio ligaments & great glutei muscles. It contains terminal portion of rectum surrounded by levatores ani and the internal & external sphincters, and on each side of which is the ischio-rectal fossa. It is triangular in form and depressed centrally towards anus, round which aperture the integu- ment is thrown into numerous folds, and becomes continuous with mucous membrane of intestine. The skin is dark, but thicker & less movable than on perineeum proper, and contains a few hair-follioles. The subcutaneous areolar tissue or superficial fascia hardly exists in centre of region, or over sphincter ani, which muscle is closely adherent to integument; but it is abundant laterally, where it is loaded with a large amount of fat, and where it dips into and fills the ischio-rectal fossa. ISCHIO-RECTAL FOSSA Is a large excavation which sinks deeply into pelvis on either side of rectum, and which is filled with a considerable amount of loose fatty areolar tissue. It is wide & triangular at its Ease, - Which corresponds to integument, but it is flattened from side to side and diminished in size superiorly. - Its Inner Wall - Is oblique downwards & inwards and formed by under surface of levator ani & by sphincter, which muscles are covered by anal fascia. Outer Wall ~ Is vertical, and is formed by obturator internus covered by obturator fascia; it presents the pudic vessels & nerve enclosed ia a sheath of fascia. It is bounded: Above - By junction of anal & obturator fasciae. In Front - By junction of the same fasciae superiorly, and, inferiorly, by junction of the superficial & deep perinaeal fasciaa behind transversus perinasi. Behind - By sacro-sciatic ligaments, coccygeus & the gluteus maximus. The vessels & nerves it contains are the : Inferior hcemorrhoidal, in the centre; Pudic, in the outer wall; Superficialperinceal, in front; A branch of'4th sacral nerve, and branches of sciatic artery <5r» small sciatic furve, behind; the branches of the latter nerve winding round lower border of gluteus maximus. Above levator ani ia the reoto-resioal layer of the pelrio fascia (Vide Pelvic P.)104 THE MALE PEEIN^IUM. Consists of the structures which close outlet of pelvis anteriorly to line drawn from front part of one tubei ischii to that of the other. It is triangular in form, and is bounded laterally by rami of pubes & ischia and posteriorly by above men- tioned line. The width of its base (rather the smallest side of the triangle) is usually about 2J inches in the male adult, but it is sometimes considerably reduced; the operation of lateral lithotomy is then greatly impeded. The part is convex in middle line & slightly depressed laterally, and presents the following layers: Skin - Thin, dark, freely movable, marked by a prominent median raphe, studded with thin crisp hairs, and provided with numerous sebaceous follicles. Superficial Fascia - Divided into two layers. Superficial Layer - Thick, areolar, contains a large amount of fat, and is continuous with sub- cutaneous tissue of surrounding regions. DEEP LAYER - Thin & aponeurotic ; lies in close contact with the muscles. On either side it is attached to rami of pubes & ischia externally to crura penis ; Behind it is connected to central tendinous point of perinamm; and is prolonged beneath sphincter ani, becoming continuous behind transversus perinsei & in front of rectum with inferior layer of deep perineal fascia; In front it is unattached, & continuous with dartos; Superiorly it gives off a median septum, which is rather deficient in front but pretty well marked behind. It binds down the superficial structures, and bounds inferiorly, and also, through its attach- ments, laterally & behind, a space, in which if urine be effused, this fluid will be directed forwards towards the scrotum, and the lower part of abdomen, and prevented from passing backwards towards anus, or outwards towards thighs. This layer is sometimes called the superficialperincealfascia. Superficial Genito-TJrinary Muscles - Are the: Erector Penis - Covering the crus; Accelerator Urines or Ejaculator Seminis - Spreading out upon bulb of urethra ; Transversus Perinsei - Separating perinseum proper from ischio-rectal region. These muscles bound a triangular area, which is crossed superficially by the superficial perinseal vessels & nerve, behind which area passes transversely inwards the transverse erinseal artery, and through which area can be seen deeply the superficial layer of the eep perina;al fascia. In lateral lithotomy the knife is carried backwards & outwards through inner & back part of this area on left side. Inferior Layer of Deep Perinseal Fascia, or Triangular Ligament of Urethra - Vide below. Membranous Portion of Urethra, Compressor Urethrse, & Deep Transversus Perinsei, Pudic "Vessels & N., Vessels & N. of Bulb, Cowper's Glands & their Ducts - Vide these parts. Superior Layer of Deep Perinseal Fascia - The deep perinseal fascia is a complex structure triangular in form, which supports the urethra, and closes anterior part of outlet of pelvis. On either side it is attached to rami of pubes & ischia internally to crura penis; Behind it is connected to central tendinous point of perinseum, and is continuous both with thin fascia on under surface of levator ani, and, behind transversus perinsei, with deep layer of superficial fascia of perinseum; In front it is attached to pubic arch & sub-pubic ligament. It consists of two aponeurotic layers which are separated in the centre, but united laterally & behind ; of these two layers the Anterior, Inferior, or Superficial Layer - The thickest, is continued downwards & forwards upon anterior part of membranous portion of urethra, and is lost upon the bulb. This layer is perforated by the urethra about an inch below symphysis pubis, by dorsal vein of penis in front of urethra, & by pudic vessels & nerve on either side of the vein ; it is the only layer that can properly be called the triangular ligament of the urethra, though the term is sometimes applied to both layers taken together. POSTERIOR, Superior, OR Deep Layer - Thinner. Is continued upwards & backwards round (posterior part of membranous portion of urethra, and becomes continuous with pelvic fascia. Between these two layers are comprised the parts above mentioned, viz,, membranous por- tion of urethra with compressor urethrce &° deep transversus perineei muscles, pudic vessels nerve with vessels <2^ nerve of bulb, Cowper's glands &* their ducts. Above these parts are found in centre of perinseum the Prostate Gland & Neck of Bladder, - and laterally the Anterior Part of Levator Ani & of Pelvic Fascia - The latter fascia is continued posteriorly upon posterior part of levator ani, upon rectum & between it & bladder, and belongs as much to ischio-rectal region as to the perinseal.105 MUSCLES of the MALE PERINEUM.

The peritoneum is by fair the most extensive & complex serous membrane of the body. To aesoribe rt completely it is necessary to trace: 1. - The two sacs separately in the vertical direction & in the middle line; 2. - The two sacs together in the veJtical direction; 3. -The greater sac horizontally below the level of the umbilicus; ^ 4. -The two sacs together horizontally above the level of the umbilicus, or through the foramen of Winslowj 5. - The ligaments formed by the peritoneum, and the omenta & mesenteries. Along the colon & upper part of the rectum the peritoneum is thrown into numerous pendu- lous processes filled with adipose tissue and termed the appendices epiploic®. THE TWO SACS SEPARATELY. THE GREATER SAC, Starting from umbilicus the peritoneum passes: - Over anterior wall of abdomen & diaphragm ; Over upper surface of liver, forming suspensory or falciform ligament &* upper layer of Over under surface of liver to transverse fissure; coronary ligament, To lesser curvature of stomach & first portion of duodenum, forming anterior layer r. , . „ „ , , of lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum , Uver anterior surface of stomach; J or Downwards in front of intestine, forming anterior layer of 'great omentmn ; Upwards to transverse colon, forming posterior layer of great omentum ; Over under surface of transverse colon; To spine, forming inferior layer of transverse meso-colon & covering under surface of transverse portion of duodenum ; - (In the foetus, also occasionally in the child, and even, though very rarely in the adult, the layer of peritoneum which continues the posterior layer of the great omentum ascends in front of the transverse colon without adhering to it, or adhering to it but slightly, and then passes backwards to the spine above the transverse 'neso-colon. The transverse meso-colon is then formed by the peritoneum again passing forwards from the spine to the transverse colon, sur- rounding the latter, and for the second time passing backwards to the spine. The pouch between the transverse meso-colon & the posterior layer of the great omentum subsequeiitly disappears by degrees, adhesions amounting finally to complete fusion of the two layers into one, being established between the two walls of the pouch before adult age is reached).

Crural - Beneath Pouparts ligament on inner side of psoas. Pierces fascia lata on outer side of femoral artery, and suppl/ss skin of upper and front part of thigh; communicates with middle cutaneous. EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS — From 2nd lumbar nerve, and, by a few filaments, from the 3rd. | Pierces psoas muscle towards its middle and crosses iliacus. Passes beneath Poupart's ligament through notch below anterior superior spme of ilium, and divides into branches: — Anterior - Pierces fascia lata about four inches below Poupart's ligament, and supplies skin of anterior & outer aspects of thigh as low as knee. Posterior - Supplies skin of outer & posterior aspect of thigh.THE DIAPHBAGM. Is fan-shaped; the expanded portion of the fan being horizontal, and the narrow portion or handle, ver* tical. It presents for examination its points of origin & the fibres arising from them, its eentral or ________ __ — ,__^.„«„ cordiform tendon, its openings, & its relations. POINTS OF ORIGIN & FIBRES ARISING FROM THEM: Ensiform Cartilage - Gives attachment to a narrow & sometimes tendinous slip, on either side ot wnicn the costal cartilages & the costal fibres bound a narrow triangular area, over the extent n +-i „ of which area the pleuraa & the peritoneum are separated only by a little areolar tissue. Cartilages & Osseous Portions of the 6 or 7 Lower Ribs - Give rise to the long arched T . . . . lateral fibres, which, at their point of origin, interdigitate with the transversal is. Lilgamentum Areuatum Internum - A thickened band of the fascia over the psoas, extending trom side of body of 1st, & sometimes from that of 2nd lumbar vertebra, to tip of transverse process of 1st & sometimes to that of 2nd. Gives rise to arched fibres similar but rather shorter. iilgamentum Arcuatum Externum - A thickened band of the fascia over quadratus lumborum (anterior lamella of posterior abdominal aponeurosis), extending from tip of transverse process ot first lumbar vertebra, & sometimes from that of 2nd, to lower border & apex of last rib. rt j. , . '_ Gires rise to similar arched fibres. ^rifhV Se^on^.T1l1,rd & Fourth Lumbar Vertebra? by means of the is&VKA — l wo thick fibro-muscular bundles, which arise bv tendinous fibres as follows: Kight Crus - The thickest & longest, from front of bodies & intervertebral substances of 1st, t mf ' ^r R0Tnetimes of 2nd> 3rd, & 4th lumbar v., & from ant. common ligfc. of spine. LEFT Crus - The shortest & narrowest, from left side of bodies & intervertebral substances of 1st & 2nd or sometimes of 2nd & 3rd lumbar vertebra, & from ant. common ligfc. of spine. . . ,T.he tendons ascend for a short distance on either side of the aorta, and then become joined m front of that vessel by means of a tendinous arch formed by the blending of their innermost fibres. The crura then give rise, as well as the intervening arch to two large fleshy bellies, the outer fasciculi of which bellies pass upwards & outwards to the cordiform tendon, while the inner ones first decussate in front of the aorta (those of the right side being the largest & most anterior), then diverge to surround the oesophagus, and finally meet again in iront of it before they end in the central tendon. (In some very rare cases these fasciculi do not join in front of the oesophagus, a portion of the anterior margin of the oesophageal opening is then tendinous). CENTRAL Or CORDIFORM TENDON — The common insertion of all the fibres. Has somewhat the shape of a trefoil leaf; and presents anteriorly three leaflets; the right one is long, broad, & the largest; the left one, long, narrow, & the smallest; the middle one short, broad, & OPENINGS - Are: intermediate in size. Large Openings - Three: Aortic Opening - For aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct & frequently the left cord of the sym- pathetic. Lies in middle line, and is osteo-fibrous, being bounded behind by bodies of vertebrae, laterally by tendons of the crura, and in front by the fibrous arch which joins the latter. (Esophageal Opening - For oesophagus & pneumogastric nerves. Lies higher up, & a little to the left. Is oval in form & entirely muscular, being formed by the inner decussating fasciculi of the fleshy portion of the crura; - in some very rare cases a portion of the anterior margin is fibrous, & formed by the posterior border of cordiform tendon. Opening for Inferior Vena Cava - The highest; lies a little to the right between right & middle leaflets of cordiform tendon. Is quadrilateral & fibrous, being bounded by four bundles of tendin- Small Openings - Transmit; ons fibres which meefc at risht ansles- Right cord of sympathetic, &* sometimes the left; Right & left great, lesser, &* least splanchnic nerves, either separately or conjointly. Vena azygos minor, 6° sometimes the major - These openings vary therefore in number. RELATIONS - Of Upper Surface: Laterally - Pleurae; lungs. Also at circumference of thorax for a considerable though variable ex- tent, lower ribs & lower intercostal spaces, the lungs not descending under ordinary circum- stances as low as the costal attachments of the diaphragm & the point of reflection of the pleurae The lateral portions of the diaphragm are the most movable; their degree of elevation or depression varies much more than that of the central part in accordance with the respiratory movements, and with the degree of distension, or otherwise, of the stomach, intestines, & uterus. The right lateral portion of the diaphragm, on account of the pressure of the liver on that side, rises by one or two ribs' breadths higher than the left, and reaches the level of In Forced Expiration -4th costal cartilage; In State of Repose of Thorax - 5th costal cartilage; In Forced Inspiration - Line from ensiform cartilage, to back of 10th rib. Centrally - Heart & base of pericardium, the fibrous layer of which latter sac blends more particu- larly with the anterior & left part of central leaflet of cordiform tendon, & with the fascia covering the left anterior costal fibres. The central part of the diaphragm is flattened & less movable, and lies on a lower level than the lateral portions, except close to the sternum, in front, & to the vertebras, behind, where, on the contrary, it rises a little higher. Of Under Surface - This is entirely covered by peritoneum except behind pancreas, kidneys & supra- renal capsules, and at points of attachment of coronary & lateral ligaments of liver, gastro-phrenio ligament, & suspensory ligament of spleen; it lies in mediate contact wikk liver, stomach & spleen.PELVIS & MALE GENITO-URINARY ORGANS.134 PERITONEUM.

Is continuous with fascia over psoas & iliacus and with fascia transversalis, and is slightly adherent to brim of pelvis, especially at sides. It is thin posteriorly, where it covers pyriformis muscle & sacral plexus, and passes behind internal iliac vessels which perforate it. In front it forms a single thick layer over obturator internus as low down as a white linear thickening, which linear thickening extends in a curved direction from spine of ischium to side of lower part of symphysis pubis, and both gives attachment to middle fibres of levator ani, and marks point of division of pelvic fascia into recto- vesical & obturator layers, or recto-vesical & obturator fasciae. Reeto-Vesical Fascia - Is continued over inner surface of levator ani to bladder, prostate or vagina, & rectum. In front it forms anterior true ligaments of bladder, or pubo-prostatic ligaments. Further back it ascends over side of prostate, inclosing this gland & the prostatio plexus of veins, and is then continued on the bladder forming its lateral true ligaments. Posteriorly it sends a prolongation between the bladder & rectum, which prolong, ation invests the vesiculsa seminales. Obturator Fascia - Descends on portion of obturator internus muscle which lies beneath levator ani, and becomes attached to pubic arch & sacro-sciatic ligaments. It forms a canal for pudic vessels & nerve, and gives off a thin layer, the anal or ischio-rectal fascia, to under surface of levator ani & to third part of rectum.SIDE VIEW of the MALE PELVIS.

Are the: - Scrotum - Consists of two layers: Integument - Thin & brownish; presents a few sebaceous follicles & thinly scattered cripp hairs, and is divided into two lateral halves by a median raphe, which raphe is continued forwards on under surface of penis and backwards along middle line of perinseum to anus. Is closely applied to the testes and is corru- gated transversely when the dartos is contracted, that is to say, usually in the young & robust, and in all under the influence of cold, and is elongated & flaccid when the dartos is relaxed, that is to say, usually in the debilitated & aged, and in all under the influence of warmth. Dartos - Is a thick stratum of loose reddish tissue, a modification of the superficial fascia of the surrounding regions, consisting of areolar tissue with numerous superadded muscular fibres and without any fat; it sends inwards between the two testicles a septum, the septum scroti, which divides its cavity into two. - It is contractile, but its contractility is slow in its action, and especially excited by cold, not by electricity. Intercolumnar or External Spermatic Fascia - Thin cellular layer derived from the margins of the external abdominal ring during the descent of the testis, and continuous above with the intercolnmnar fibres, which bound that ring superiorly. Cremasteric Fascia - Consists of the scattered o'u.,idles of fibres of the cremaster & internal oblique muscles united by a little areolar tissue. Fascia Propria - Relatively thick layer, the continuation of the infundibuliform process of the fascia transversalis, which layer supports both the cremasteric fascia & the tunica vaginalis reflexa. Tunica Vaginalis - Is derived from the peritoneum, of which it is at first a continuation, but from which it is subsequently cut off by the closure of that part of the peritoneal pouch, which extends from the internal abdominal ring to a short distance from the testicle. - Is divided into: Visceral Portion or Tunica Vaginalis Propria - Surrounds the testicle, and covers both the upper or outer surface of the epididymis and also the under surface of its central part or body, penetrating, along its outer border, between it & the testicle, and thus forming the digital fossa. Parietal Portion, or Tunica Vaginalis Reflexa - Is reflected from the posterior bor. der of the testicle upon the inner surface of the fascia propria, extending, however,, a short distance up the cord upon its anterior & inner aspects.141 THE TESTICLE & EPIDIDYMIS. THE TESTICLE Is oval & compressed laterally, and so suspended by the spermatic cord as to present ? Upper Extremity - The largest, directed forwards & outwards. "Presents a small pedun- culated body, the hydatid of Morgagni, probably a remnant of Muller's duct. Lower Extremity - The smaller, directed backwards & inwards. Lateral Surfaces - Looking respectively forwards & inwards, and backwards & outwards. Anterior Border - Convex, directed forwards, downwards & outwards. - All these parts are free, smooth, and entirely invested by the tunica vaginalis propria. Posterior Border - Straight & flattened, directed backwards, upwards & inwards, covered by the epididymis & vas deferens, and only partly invested by the tunica vaginalis. The left testicle lies a little lower than the right one, and is frequently a little larger. THE EPIDIDYMIS Lies on the posterior border and back part of the outer surface of the testicle, and has the vas deferens on its inner side. It presents : Globus Maj or Or Head - Itg upper enlarged extremity, connected to the testicle by the efferent ducts of the latter. Body - Free, surrounded by the tunica vaginalis, which dips in between it & the testicle along its outer border, and connects its inner or posterior border to the posterior border of the testicle. Globus Minor or Tail - Its lower pointed extremity, attached to the testicle by dense fibrous tissue. The tunica vaginalis covers the whole of the upper or outer surface of the epididymis, as well as the under surface of its body. - The vas aber- rans of Haller communicates with the canal of the epididymis or with the commencement of the vas deferens.142 STRUCTURE of the TESTICLE & EPIDIDYMIS. STRUCTURE Of the TESTICLE — Presents for examination: - THREE IMMEDIATE COVERINGS : — Tunica Vaginalis - "Vide Coverings of the testicle. Tunica Albuginea - Thick, dense, bluish-white, fibrous membrane, covered exter- nally by the tunica vaginalis propria except along the points of attach* ment of the epididymis & vas deferens, and reflected into the interior of the testicle along its posterior or upper border in the shape of aa incom- plete vertical septum, the mediastinum testis or Corpus Highmorianum. This latter body supports the vessels & nerves and the excretory ducts of the testicle in their passage to or from the gland, and gives off numerous trabecule, which radiate towards the whole extent of the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, and inclose the numerous pyramidal spaces con- taining the lobules of the gland substance. Tunica Vasculosa or Pia Mater Testis - Consists of a plexus of blood-vessels held together by delicate areolar tissue, and formed by the subdivision of the superficial set of brs. of the spermatic artery. Branches given off by this plexus, penetrate into the substance of the gland, supported by the trabeculaj. PROPER SUBSTANCE or PARENCHYMA — Consists of numerous pyramidal lobules contained in the pyramidal spaces bounded by the trabeculae, and pre- senting a base directed towards the surface of the testicle and an apex directed towards the mediastinum. Of these lobules the central ones are the largest. The degree to which the lobules are isolated by the trabecule is somewhat vari- able, hence the different estimates of their number, 250 (Berres), 400 (Krause). Each lobule consists of from otic to three or more tubuli seminiferi, the number & the length of which tubuli has also been variously estimated,- 300, sixteen feet in length (Monro), 840, two feet & a quarter in length (Lautaj. - The diameter of the tubuli is from to of an inch. They consist from without inwaras of a. delicate fibro-areolar coat, a basement membrane, and sometimes a layer of granular nucleated epithelium. The epithelium is absent, however, when the gland is particularly active; the tubuli are then filled with cells of different sizes without any regular araugement. The tubuli seminiferi commence towards the surface of the testicle, sometimes by free coecal or blind extremities, but more commonly by anastomatic loops. They are exceedingly convoluted in the peripheral part of the gland; their convolutions are of two orders, viz., a fine & regular undulation giving a granular appear- ance to the whole of their mass, and a more complicated folding of the undulating tube. Towards the apices of the lobules they become straighter, and they coalesce into from twenty to thirty straight tubes the vasa recta, which are from to ^ of an inch in diameter. The vasa recta enter the mediastinum, and passing upwards & backwards, they form within that body a network of anastomosing tubules, the rete testis or rete vasculosum testis. The rete testis is continued superiorly into from twelve to fifteen or twenty •vasa efferentia f The vasa efferentia perforate the tunica albuginea at the upper & back part of the testicle. In their extra-testicular course, which is about 6 or 8 inches long, they are at first straight & relatively wide, but they soon become convoluted & slightly narrowed, and form a series of conical masses, the coni vasculosi, which latter constitute together the globus major of the epididymis. They are lined with ciliated epithelium. The excretory ducts of the testicle open finally into the commencement of the canal of the epididymis at apparently narrow intervals, which intervals however, are seen, when the canal of the epididymis is unravelled, to measure from two to three inches in length STRUCTURE Of the EPIDIDYMIS — The epididymis consists of a single tube about twenty feet long, by which the tubuli seminiferi open into the vas deferens. Ifc is at first very thin & exceedingly convoluted, and of a diameter of about ^ of an inch. It diminishes a little in size for a short distance, but it soon increases con- siderably, the thickness of its walls increasing also, and its course becoming less tortuous. A little fine areolar tissue binds its convolutions together, thicker septa being interposed between the larger masses of coils termed lobes, which latter are mostly transverse in direction. The epithelium of the canal of the epididymis is ciliated (Becker, Kolliker). - The Vas aberrans of Hailer (Vide spermatic cord) is usually connected either with the canal of the epididymis or with the commence- ment of the vas deferens.143 7AS DEPEBENS, VESICULiE SEMINALES, & EJA- CULATORY DUCTS. VAS DEFEEENS Ascends on inner side of epididymis along lower three-fourths of posterior border of tes- ticle,- to which it is attached by firm areolar tissue. Along back of spermatic cord to external abdominal ring 5 Through external abdominal ring, inguinal canal & internal abdominal ring; Downwards, backwards, inwards to base of bladder, passing on outer side of epigastric & obliterated hypogastric arteries and then on inner side of ureter j Forwards & inwards between bladder & rectum, along inner side of vesicula seminalia becoming enlarged & sacculated; Narrows to a point, and joins opposite base of prostate with duct of corresponding vesi- cula seminalis, to form the common seminal or ejaculatory duct. Its canal is very small. Its walls are very thick & dense, and consist from without inwards of a cellular coat, of a muscular coat presenting two longitudinal layers & an intermediate circular layer of fibres, and of a mucous coafc covered with colum- nar non-ciliated epithelium. The vas aberrans of Haller communicates with the canal of the*epididymis or with the commencement of the vas deferens. VESICULA SEMINALES Two lobulated membranous pouches about inches long obliquely disposed between base of bladder & second part of rectum, and presenting: Post. Diverging Extremities —' Enlarged, and reach as far back as - ter- mination of ureters. Ant. Converging Extremities - Pointed j join at base of prostate with termin. ation of the corresponding vas deferens to form the common seminal or ejaculatory duct. Upper Surface - In contact with base of bladder. Under Surface - Rests upon second part of rectum, from which it is sepa- rated by a process of the recto-vesical layer of the pelvic fascia. They have the enlarged & sacculated vasa deferentia to their inner side, and bound laterally a triangular portion of the base of the bladder which corresponds to trigonum vesicas. Each vesicula seminalis consists of a tube from four to six inches long, and of about the diameter of a crow quill. This tube is irregularly coiled upon itself, and gives off numerous ccecal diverticula, which, as well as the coils of the tube, are bound together by firm areolar tissue. Its walls are thin, and consist of fibrous, muscular & mucous coats, the epithelium of the latter being squamous. EJACULATORY DUCTS Two small canals about | of an inch in length formed by the junction opposite the base of the prostate of the vas deferens with the duct of the vesicula seminalis. They pass forwards & inwards through the substance of the prostate along the side of the verumontanum, and terminate by a slit-like opening upon or within the mar- gins of the vesicula prostatica or sinus pocularis. Their walls are thin, and eonsist of a delicate fibrous coat & of muscular & mucous coatl144 THE SPEEMATIO COED. Consists of the portion of the vas deferens which extends from the testicle to the internal ab- dominal ring, and of the accompanying arteries, veins, lymphatics, & nerves and contains the vas aberrans & the organ of G-iraldes. These structures are bound together by delicate areolar tissue, and are invested from within outwards by: Tunica vaginalis, below j Fascia propria, along the whole Cramasteric fascia, along nearly the whole of the course of the cord j Jntercolumnar fascia, dartos & skin of the scrotum, below the external abdominal ring. Vas deferens - Lies at the back. Arteries -Are the spermatic, the artery of the vas deferens from the superior vesical, and the cre7nasteric branch of the epigastric. Veins - Are the spermatic veins, which pass up in front of the vas deferens, forming the pampiniform plexus, and then unite in a single trunk, which accompanies the abdomi- nal portion of the spermatic artery and terminates in the left renal vein, on the left side, in the inferior vena cava, on the right. Lymphatics - Terminate in the lumbar glands. Nerves - Are the ilio-inguinal, the genital branch of the genito-crural, frequently a branch of the ilio-hypogastric, and the spermatic plexus of the sympathetic, which latter is derived from the renal, aortic & hypogastric plexuses. Vas Aberrans (Haller) -A narrow tortuous tube from \\ to 14 inches long, connected with the commencement of the vas deferens or with the lower part of the canal of the epididymis, and passing upwards for 1 or 2 inches among the other vessels ol the spermatic cord. It ends in a blind extremity, and is sometimes unconnected with the seminal ducts. It was probably connected in the foetus with the Wolffian ^ body. Organ Of Giraldes - A collection of minute convoluted tubules, probably a remnant ot the Wolffian body, found in the lower & front part of the cord close to the head of the epididymis145 THE PEOSTATE GLAND. Is a pale firm glandular structure of about the size & shape of a horse-chesnut, situated beneath the trigonum vesicae and around the neck of the bladder & commencement of the urethra; below and behind the symphysis pubis & the pubo-prostatic ligaments or anterior tru© liga- ments of the bladder; above & in front of the second part of the rectum and the-point of decussation of those anterior or inner fibres of the levator ani which form the levator prostatas; between the two lateral halves of the posterior or ascending layer of the deep perinaeal fascia or triangular ligament, and between the two lateral halves of the ascending portion of the recto-vesical layer of the pelvic fascia. It measures normally from to 1£ inches in its antero-posterior diameter, If inches in its greatest transverse diameter (Sir H. Thompson), an 1 about £ of an inch in depth; these measurements undergo, however, great variations in old persons, who are frequently the subjects of enlarged prostate. Ct consists of two lateral lobes separated behind by a deep notch, and of a third or middle lobe which is normally but a small rounded or triangular mass fitted in between the two lateral lobes in the under part of the organ, and lying between the ejaculatory ducts immediately beneath the neck of the bladder. The degree of development of this middle lobe, is however, very variable, it being often much enlarged in advanced life, and then pro- jecting into the neck of the bladder so as to impede the passage of urine. Dfc presents for examination: BASE — Directed backwards & upwards towards the trigonum vesicae & the neck of the bladder, and notched posteriorly. APEX — Passes downwards & forwards between the posterior or ascending layers of the deep perinaeal fascia or triangular ligament. UPPER SURFACE — Covered by and connected to the pubo-prostatic ligaments or ant. true ligaments of the bladder and the front part of the recto-vesical layer of the pelvic fascia. Is situated about § of an inch below & behind the symphysis pubis, and presents a slight longitudinal furrow. UNDER SURFACE — Eests upon the lower part of the second portion of the rectum (just opposite the bend between the second & third portions), a process of the recto- vesical layer of the pelvic fascia beiag interposed between the two organs. Presents a slight depression, or sometimes two converging grooves which correspond to the ejaculatory ducts and which demarcate the central lobe. LATERAL SURFACES — Covered by the layers of fascia above mentioned, by those anterior or inner fibres of the levatores ani which go to form the levator prostatas, and by the reflections of the peritoneum from the bladder to the sides of the pelvis which reflections form the lateral false ligaments of the bladder. It is perforated by the urethra, which usually lies nearer its upper than its lower surface, and also by the ejaculatory ducts which pass forwards & inwards through the lower part of the gland along the side of the verumontanum, and terminate by a slit-like opening upon or within the margins of the vesicula prostatica or sinus pocularis. STRUCTURE — Structurally the prostate presents: Fibrous Capsule — Distinct from the fibrous investment derived from the two halves of the posterior or ascending layer of the deep perinaeal fascia & from the recto-vesical layer of the pelvic fascia, and separated from these by prosta- tic plexus of veins. It sends off fibrous prolongations into the interior of the gland. Glandular Subtance — Consists of follicular pouches which are grouped around, and open into, numerous elongated canals, by the junction of which from twelve to twenty excretory ducts are formed; these open into the prostatic sinus on the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra. Muscular Fibres — Are abundant in the fibrous capsule. The urethra is surroun- ded, as it passes through the prostate, by a thick layer of circular fibres con- tinuous behind with the fibres of the sphinde*' vesicae, and in front with those of the membranous portion of the urethra. Vessels & Nerves Arteries are derived from the internal pudic, vesical & middle haemorrhohial. Veins form an important plexus around sides & base of prostate t they receive in front the dorsal-vein of the penis, aud open behind into internal iliac vein. Lymphatics ramify on the outer surface of the capsule. Nerves are derived from hypogastric plexus* 19146 THE MALE URETHRA. Is about 8| inohes long, and extends from neck of bladder to end of penis. It presents beneath the pubes a fixed curve conoave superiorly, and In front of tho pubes in the flaccid state of the penis, a second flexible curve concave inferiorly. It is divided into t - PROSTATIC PORTION — The widest & most dilatable part, spindle-shaped, inohes long; passes through the prostate from base to apex, lying nearer its upper than its lower surface. Its transverse section is of a horse-shoe shape concave inferiorly. On its floor are the following parts: - Urethral Crest, Verumontanum or Caput Gallinaginis - Longitudinal elevation 8 or 9 lines in length and lines high at its central & highest part, consisting, accord, ing to Kobelt, of muscular fibres & erectile tissue. On either side of the oresfc is the Prostatic Sinus - A longitudinal groove into which open the ducts of the lateral lobe of the prostate. On the front part of the crest is the Utricle, Sinus Poculahis or Vesicula Prostatica - An expanding cul-de-sac, which passes backwards into the substance of the middle lobe of the prostate for about a quarter of an inch, and upon or within the margins of which are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts. MEMBRANOUS PORTION —The shortest, and, excepting the meatus, the narrowest part ~ of the canal. It extends from apex of prostate to bulb of corpus spongiosum, and is situated between the two layers of the deep perinseal fascia, which layers are pro- longed around it, the one downwards & forwards, the other upwards & backwards. Its upper surface is concave superiorly, § of an inch long, and situated about an inoh below & behind the pubic arch, from which arch it is separated by the anterior fibres of the compressor urethras muscle & by the dorsal vessels & nerves of the penis. Its under surface is convex inferiorly, only \ inch long (in consequence of the bulb pro- jecting backwards beneath the urethra), and separated from the rectum by a triangu- lar space, broad below, narrow above, the perinseum. SPONGY PORTION — Commences within the bulb below & behind the symphysis pubis, ascends a short distance in front of the symphysis within the corpus spongiosum, curves downwards with the latter in the flaccid state of the penis, and ends at the meatus nrinarius. It is about six inches long. la the greatest part of its course it is uniform in size, and intermediate between the prostatic & membranous portions; it is dilated, however, within the bulb & within the glans penis (in which latter situation the dila- tation forms the fossa navicularis), and is greatly constricted at the meatus. Its transverse section is elongated from side to side except within the glans penis, where it is elongated vertically. On its walls, and more particularly on its floor, are the open- ings of numerous mucous glands, the glands of Littre, whioh openings are directed for- wards, and are sometimes large enough to interoept the passage of small catheters; this is especially the case with one of them, which is situated on the upper wall of the fossa navicularis, and which constitutes the lacuna magna. On the floor of its pos- terior dilated portion comprised within the bulb, and sometimes termed the bulbous portion, are the openings of the ducts of Cowper's glands. STRUCTURE — Three coats t - MUCOUS Coat - Thin, pale in the prostatic portion, rosy in the membranous & spongy portions, in which it is thrown into longitudinal folds (except when the canal is distended with urine). Covered with columnar epithelium except in the fossa navicularis, where the epithelium is squamous. Presents the glands of Littre above described, which glands are most abundant in the spongy portion, and presents also, near the meatus, a few papillra. MuSCUlar Coat - Consists of external longitudinal & internal circular unstriped mus- cular fibres, both most abundant, in the prostatic portion. Erectile Coat - Thick in the spongy portion, where it forms the corpus spongiosum (Yide Structure of the Penis). From this a thin layer of ereotile tissue is pro- longed upwards round the membranous & prostatic portions as far as the neck of the bladder, forming in the prostatic portion, according to Kobelt, the veru- montanum or caput gallinaginis.147 STRUCTURE of the PENIS, CORPORA CAVERNOSA — Arise from the anterior & inner part of the two ischial tuberosities, and from the ascending rami of the ischia & descending rami of the pubes, by two pointed prolongations, the crura penis. These pass forwards & inwards, present a Blight enlargement, the bulb of the corpus cavernosum, and unite to form the body of the penis. - The body of the penis presents on its upper surface a narrow median groove for the dorsal vessels & serves of the organ, and, on its under surface a broader groove, which receives the corpus spongiosum. It ends anteriorly in a rounded extremity over- lapped by the base of the glans. CORPUS SPONGIOSUM — Commences between the two converging crura of the corpora cavernosa by an expanded portion, the bulb of the urethra. This latter is penetrated superiorly by the membranous portion of the urethra, is marked inferiorly by a partial division into two lobes, and is surrounded by the accelerator urinas muscle & by a pro- longation of the anterior or descending layer of the deep perinaeal fascia. - It passes for- wards, as an erectile tube, round the spongy portion of the urethra, and terminates in the glans penis, a conical enlargement, which overlaps the anterior rounded extremity of the two corpora cavernosa. STRUCTURE of the CORPORA CAVERNOSA & SPONGIOSUM - They consist of; FibrOUS Investment - Thick, dense, firm, especially over the corpora cavernosa, highly elastic, but incapable of more than a certain degree of distention; formed of white & yellow elastic fibrous tissues and of unstriped muscular fibres disposed longitudinally in the superficial strata, circularly in the deeper ones. It forms but an incomplete septum between the two corpora cavernosa in their points of contact: - The septum is thick & imperforate behind, but it only consists in front of a few vertical bands arranged somewhat like the teeth of a comb, and forming the septum pectiniforme. It gives off numerous trabeculse from its inner surface. - In the corpora cavernosa the trabeculse are strongest towards the periphery, and the com- partments they bound are transversely or circularly disposed & largest towards the centre. In the corpus spongiosum the trabeculse are more deli- cate, and the compartments are longitudinal & more uniform, except in the glans penis where their arrangement is somewhat complex. Erectile Tissue - Consists of afferent arteries, a venous plexus, & efferent veins. Afiekejst Arteries - Are the arteries of the corpora cavernosa & the arteries of the bulb, and twigs from the internal pudic & the dorsal arteries of the penis. Some of the branches of these arteries terminate in capil- lary plexuses as in other parts of the body. Others, the helicine arteries, which are said to be especially numerous towards the root of the penis and to be wanting in the glans, become convoluted, and forming tendril-like twigs, project singly or in tufts iuto the venous spaces, and end in dilated extremities wbich are either open or closed (Miiller). This is denied however by Valentin, who describes the smallest branches of the arteries as ending in wide funnel-shaped oinfices, which open directly into the venous spaces. Venous Plexus - Is very intricate. So numerous & large are the communica- tions between the veins that the blood appears to be effused into a system of extra-vascular structures. Efferent Veins - Some emerge from the corona glandis and from the upper & under surfaces of the corpora cavernosa, and join the dorsal vein of the penis j most pass out at the root of the penis, and join the prosta- tic plexus & the pudic veins. The proper nerves of the cavernous structures are*derived mainly from the pelvic & prostatic plexuses of the sympathetic, but partly also from the pudic nerve. .148 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. Short thick trunk which extends from bifurcation of common iliao artery opposite sacro- vertebral articulation (some Authors say opposite sacro-iliac synchondrosis) to tipper border of great sacro-sciatic foramen, near which it divides into anterior & posterior divisions. Usually inches long, but its length may vary from | an inch to 3 inches. Rather smaller in adult than the external iliac. Twice as large in foetus: - Under the name of hypogastric artery, it then continues the common iliac along side of bladder, and ascends to umbilicus where it becomes one of the umbilical arteries. RELATIONS: In Fbont - Peritoneum, ureter. Behind - Pyriformis, internal iliac vein, lumbo-sacral cord. On Outer Side neae Oeigin - Psoas & external iliac vein. BRANCHES — Are given off as follows, from: - ANT. DIVISION — Sup. Middle & Inf. Vesical, Middle Hemor- rhoidal, and in female, uterine & Vaginal; Obturator, Sciatic, Pudie. POST. DIVISION - Ilio-Lumbar, Lateral Sacral, Gluteal.149 BRANCHES of the INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY—1st T. BRANCHES FROM ANTERIOR DIVISION. VISCERAL BRANCHES: Vesical-Two or three j but other twigs pass to bladder from middle hemorrhoidal, uterine, vaginal, & obturator. Superior Vesical - Is that part of hypogastric artery which extends to side of bladder, and which remains pervious after birth. Gives off artery of vat deferens, and tha Middle Vesical, - Which is often wanting. Inferior Vesical - Usually arises in common with middle hemorrhoidal. To base of bladder, prostate, & vesiculaB seminales. Middle HseiQOrrlloidal - Joins with superior hemorrhoidal branch of inferior mesenteric, and with inferior hemorrhoidal branch of internal pudic. Uterine - Downwards to neck of uterus, and then upwards in a tortuous course along side of body between folds of broad ligament 5 communicates with ovarian. Vaginal - Descends upon vagina to neck of bladder & rectum. NON-VISCERAL BRANCHES: Obturator - Usually arises (2 cases out of 3) from anterior division or sometimes from posterior division of internal iliac. In one case in 3^ it arises from the epigastric, that is to say that its anastomotic branch with that artery is enormously increased in size while its proper root is proportionately dimin- ished. Sometimes both roots are nearly equally developed (1 case in 72). Occasionally the artery arises from termination of external iliac. In cases of abnormal origin from epigastric the obturator artery usually arises from near the root of the latter, and then descends into the pelvis close to the external iliac vein and on the outer side of the femoral ring. Some- times, however, it arises from the epigastric higher up, that is to say at a distance from the root of the latter; it then passes inwards above the femoral ring and descends into the pelvis on the inner side of that ring behind Grimberat'soligament. It is in this latter case only that the obturator artery is exposed to be wounded in the operation for strangulated femoral hernia. When it arises from the internal iliac it passes forwards along outer wall of pelvis below obturator nerve, giving off small iliao & vesical branches and a pubio branch which communicates on back of pubes with its fellow and with the epigastric. Through upper part of obturator foramen, and divides into: Internal Br. - Bound inner margin of obturator foramen; supplies obturator & adductor muscles, pectineus & gracilis and anasto- moses with internal circumflex. External Br. - Bound outer margin of obturator foramen to inter- val between gemellus inferior & quadratus femoris, sends an articular branch to hip-joint through cotyloid notch, and anasto- moses with external circumflex & sciatic arteries; supplies obtu- rator externus & the lower external rotator muscles.

Depression on front of neck of condyle & interarticular fibro-cartilage of temporo-maxillary articulation. - S. by anterior or smaller division of inferior maxillary nerve.185 TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. Is a double or bilatoral condyloid articulation (Cruveilhier) comprised between the condyles of the lower jaw, on the one hand, and the anterior root of the zygoma & ante ior part of the glenoid cavity, on the other. The articulation is divided into two by an interarticular fibro- cartilage, and presents two synovial membranes, of which the upper one is the largest & loosest. The interarticular fibrocartilage is thickest at the periphery, especially behiad; its upper furface is concavo-convex from before backwards; its under surface is concave; its circumference is connected externally to the external lateral ligament, internally & in front to the tendon of the external pterygoid. - Occasionally it is perforated in the centre, the two synovial membranes then communicating. LIGAMENTS - Are • Capsular - Thin & loose; from Circumference of glenoid cavity &* eminentia articularis to Neck of Condyle ' * External Lateral - Broad band downwards & backwards from Outer surface 6r> tubercle of zygoma to Outer surface <S° posterior border of neck of condyle* Internal Lateral - Long & thin band from Spine of sphenoid to Inner margin of dentalforamen. -It is related externally the to external pterygoid muscle, internal maxillary artery, and inferior dental vessels & nerve.

MOVEMENTS - Are depression, elevation, projection, retraction, lateral displacement & cir- cumduction. In slight movements of elevation & depression the condyles simpljf rotate on a transverse axis upon the interarticular fibrocartilages. In moro extensive movements not only do the condyles rotate as above, but they also pass forwards with the interarticular fibrocartilages upon the eminentise articu- lares, the displacement being due to the laxity of the superior synovial mem- brane & to the action of the external lateral ligament. This displacement also takes place on the two sides alternately in the lateral or grinding move- xnent of the jaw, and on both sides simultaneously in the projection of the jaw forwards.186 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY.

MUCOUS MEMBRANE. Thick & rough on anterior two-thirds of dorsum, sides, & tip; thin & smooth on posterior third of dorsum & on under surface. Consists of a cutis or corium dense & very similar to that of the skin, and 01 a thick layer of squamous epithelium j and presents : PAPILLA — Highly sensitive vascular projections divisible into simple and compound. The former are similar to the papillae of the skin, and cover whole of tongue; the latter, which are themselves studded with simple papillae, are found on rough surface only, and are divided according to their size & shape into: Papillae Maximse or Circumvallatae - From 7 to 12; situated at junction of middle & posterior thirds of dorsum, where they are arranged in two rows oblique backwards & inwards, which rows meet at foramen coecum and form together an inverted V. They consist of a central conical projection, the base of which is free while its apex is attached, which projection is contained in a cup-shaped depression bounded itself by a prominent circular rim. - The foramen coecum is the central depression, usually large, which lodges the central papilla, itself frequently small. Papillae Mediae or Fungiformes - Club-shaped, and present narrow attached & rounded free extremities. Sparingly scattered over anterior two-thirds of dorsum, collected in greater numbers over sides & tip. Papillae Minimae, or Conicae et Filiformes - Tapering or cylindrical, closely packed over whole of rougli surface, and arranged in rows which are vertical on borders & tip, and which are, on dorsum, parallel, posteriorly, to the rows of circumvallate papillae, but, anteriorly, more directly transverse. - The simple or secondary papillae borne by the filiform papillae contain a few elastio fibres, and their epithelial sheaths are prolonged beyond them sometimes to the extent of forming a pencil of almost hair.like fibres. In the fungiform & circumvallate, and probably also in the filiform papillae, the nerves form plexuses, from which small brush-like filaments are given off to the secondary papillae. These filaments are believed to terminate in the deep extremities of spindle-shaped nucleated bodies similar to the olfactory cells of Schultze(Billroth, Key). GLANDS - Are : Follicular - Aggregated on posterior third of dorsum behind papillae ciroumvttll&tae, and very similar to the follicular recesses of the tonsils. Racemose - Lie beneath & in front of foregoing, and over sides & under surface of tongue On under surface near tip they are collected into two small oblong aaassss deeojibsd by Blandin & Nuha.200 THE TASTE-BUDS. Are flask-like bodies discovered by Loven & Schwalbe in the thick epithelial layer which surrounds the sides of the circumvallate papillae of the base of the tongue, and which have also been found of late on some of the fungiform papillae and on the epiglottis. They are pyriform in shape. Their bases rest upon the chorium. Their apices project between the superficial epithelial cells, and present a minute opening, from which a bundle of thread-like piDcesses are seen to emerge. They consist of modified epithelial cells, disposed perpendicularly to the surface, which cells may be divided into superficial & deep. The superficial cells are flattened, or ribbon-like, tapering at each end, and joined together at their sides, so as to enclose the deeper cells, as, in the flower-bud, the external scales surrouud the internal folioles. The deeper cells are spindle- shaped, enlarged in their middle, where they present a prominent nucleus, and tapering at either end. Their deeper end, which is sometimes branched, passes down into the chorium, and, it is said, becomes connected with a nerve-fibril. Their more superficial end is prolonged into one of the thread-like processes, which are seen to project from the opening of the taste-bud. The surrounding epithelial ©ells are flattened around the taste-buds, so as to enclose them in a sac or nest. The taste-buds are now believed not to be connected with the sense of taste, since they are found on the epiglottis, which is not endowed with taste.HEAD & NECK. VI THE ORBIT.202 THE ORBIT.

PULMONARY ARTERY. Short thick trunk about two inches long, which convoys the venous blood from tho right side of the heart to the lungs. Arises from apex of infundibulam of right ventriole opposite upper border of 3rd costal cartilage of left side close to sternum. Lpwards, backwards & to the left, winding spirally in front & then to the left of ascending portion of arch of aorta, the two vessels being contained in one tubular sheath of the serous layer of the pericardium. - On either side of the artery are the auricular appendices & the coronary arteries 5 behind it are the aorta & the left auricle. Pierces fibrous layer of pericardium, and divides below & in front of transverse portion of arch of aorta into: - Right Pulmonary Artery - The larger & longer. To the right behind ascending aorta & superior vena cava to root of right lung, in which it lies, both from before backwards and from above downwards, between the pulmonary veins & the bronchus. Divides into; Superior Branch - The smaller, to superior & middle lobes. Inferior Branch - The larger, to inferior lobe. Left Pulmonary Artery - The smaller & shorter, connected at its root by remains of ductus arteriosus to under surface of arch of aorta. To the left in front of descending aorta, lying, in root of left lung, above the veins & the bronchus, but behind the former & in front of the latter. Divides into: Superior Branch - The smaller, to superior lobe. Inferior Bl?anch - The larger, to inferior lobe. PULMONARY VEINS. Usually four. Commence upon the intercellular passages & air-cells in the capillary network of the pulmonary artery, but are also continuous with some of the terminal ramifications of the bronchial arteries. Their smaller divisions are bat very little larger than the corresponding branches of the pulmonary artery, and they accompany these singly, and form a single trunk for each lobule. Their larger branches are destitute of valves, and form a single trunk for eaoh lobe, the trunk from the middle lobe of the right lung uniting with that from the upper. The two trunks from right lung pass behind superior vena cava, right auricle & ascend- ing aorta, and those from left lung cross anteriorly the descending aorta; all are invested anteriorly by serous layer of pericardium. In the lnng the pulmonary vessels are generally found to lie in front of the correspond, ing bronchial tubes, the artery being above the vein. In the roots of the lungs the pulmonary veins lie in front of the arteries, and the arteries in front of the bronchus; and the order from below upwards is veins, artery, bronchus, on the right side, veins, bronchus, artery, on the left. There is sometimes a small distinct vein for middle lobe of right lung. The two left pulmonary veins often unite into one trunk.243 THE LUNGS. Light, porous, crepitant, elastic. Of a pinkish white at birth, of a mottled Siate oolonr in the adult ♦ the mottling be- coming darker & darker as age advances. Smooth & shining, marked out by dark lines into polygonal spaces corresponding to the bases of the superficial lobules, which spaces are variously crossed by other more delicate lines. Conical in shape, and present : - Outer Surface - Convex, deepest behind. Presents on either side a deep fissure oblique downwards & forwards from near apex to base, and, on the right side, another fissure oblique upwards & forwards from the middle of the foregoing. By these fissures the left lung is divided into two lobes, the right one into three; the inferior lobe is the largest in both lungs, and the middle lobe of the right side, the smallest of all. Inner Surface - Concave, deeply excavated in front, especially on the left side, to make room for the heart; presents the hilum a little above & behind its middle. Anterior Border - Thin, oblique, shorter than the posterior, deeply notched inferiorly on the left side so as to expose the pericardium; comes in contact with its fellow behind middle of sternum, the pleurae alone being interposed. Posterior Border - Thick, rounded, vertical, longer than the anterior. Base - Broad, concave, oblique downwards & backwards ; rests upon diaphragm, and its circumference fits into the groove between the diaphragm & the ribs. Descends lower down on the left side than on the right. ApeZ - Passes up into root of neck an inch or an inch & a half above first rib, and, under cover of the scaleni, comes into close contact with first & second portions of sub- clavian artery. The Right Lung is the shortest in consequence of the diaphragm ascending higher on the right side than on the left; the broadest owing to the inclination of the heart to the left; and somewhat the largest. - The Left Lung is the longest, narrowest, and somewhat the smallest. THE ROOT of the LUNG Consists of the bronchus, pulmonary & bronchial vessels, lymphatic vessels & glands, and pulmonary plexuses of the pneumogastric & sympathetic, which parts are all enclosed in a pleural sheath, and are bound together by areolar tissue in the following order: From Before Backwards On Either Side: - Pulmonary veins with the anterior pulmonary plexus; Pulmonary artery ; Bronchus with the bronchial vessels, lymphatics vessels &> glands, and the posterior pulmonary plexus. From Below Upwards On Right Side - Pulmonary veins, pulmonary artery, bronchus, with &c. On Left Side - Ptdmonary veins, bronchus, pulmonary artery. THE ROOT OF THE RIGHT LUNG — Lies behind the superior vena cava & che ri^ht auricle; the vena azygos major arches over it from behind. THE ROOT OF THE LEFT LUNG — Passes beneath the arch of the aorta; behind it are the descending portion of the arch, the oesophagus & the thoracic duct. - The root of each lung has also in front of it the phrenic nerve, and behicd it, the pneumogastric.244 the pleura; Surrounds the iung, lines the parietes of the thorax, and forms the lateral boundary of the mediastina. Tracing it horizontally from the sternum it passes: - Over costal cartilages, rids, <Sr» intercostal spaces; Forwards along side of posterior mediastinum; Outwards over posterior aspect of root of lung ; Round posterior part of inner surface, posterior border, outer surface, anterior border, ante. rior part of the inner surface of lung, dipping into the fissures between the lobes/ Inwards over anterior aspect of root of lung ; Forwards along side of pericardium to sternum. Inferiorlv it covers the diaphragm, from which a thin triangular fold, the ligamentum latum pulmonis, passes up along the side of the pericardium to the inner surface of the lung & to the lower border of its root. Superiorly it ascends into the neck an inch or an inch & a half above the first rib, and, under cover of the scaleni, comes in contact with the first & second portions of the subclavian artery. It is thinnest & most adherent over the lung & over the diaphragm. It is thickest & least ad- herent over the thoracic walls. Its inner surface is covered by a layer of pavement epi- thelium, and is moistened by a serous fluid. Its arteries are from the intercostals, internal mammary, phrenic, inferior thyroid, pericardiac, & bronchial. - Its veins correspond to its arteries. - The lymphatics of the visceral layer join with those of the lung; the lymphatics of the parietal layer join with those of the mediastina & the thoracic walls. - Its nerves are derived from the pulmonary plexuses (Kolliker), and from the phrenic & sympathatio nerves (Lushka). The two pleurse come in contact behind the middle of the sternum.THE MEDIASTINUM. la the anteroposterior septum comprised between the two lungs & pleurae. It is divided into three parts by the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. Anterior Mediastinum - Is the part in front of the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. It is narrow above, where it contains the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid, the upper part of the left internal mammary vessels, a large quantity of loose areolar tissue, & a few lymphatic glands. It is narrower still behind the middle piece of the sternum, where the two pleurae come in direct contaot as low down as the 4th costal cartilage. Quite inferiorly, in consequence of the notch in the lower part of the anterior border of the left lung, it expands to the left behind the 4th & 5th intercostal spaces of the left side; here it contains the lower part of the left internal mammary vessels, & that part of the triangularis sterni muscle, which overlies the apex of the heart. Middle Mediastinum - Is the part which contains the pericardium, heart & large vessels (ascending aorta, pulmonary vessels, superior vena cavaj - the inferior vena cava enters pericardium through opening in cordiform tendon of diaphragm), and also the phrenic nerves. It is the widest part of the mediastinum. Posterior Mediastinum - la the part behind the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. It contains the descending aorta, trachea, oesophagus ; the vense azygos major & minor & the left superior intercostal; the pneumogastric & splanchnic nerves; the thoracic duct; fat & lymphatic glands. Posterior Mediastinum.—In the Ninth Edition of Quain's Anatomy, Professor Thane cuts off the upper part of the mediastinum as hitherto described to form the Superior Mediastinum. " The Superior Mediastinum may be considered *' as bounded below by a plane passing through the lower part of the body of the "fourth dorsal vertebra behind, and the junction of the manubrium with the body " of the sternum in front. Its upper limit corresponds with the superior aperture " of the thorax. In front are the manubrium and the lower ends of the sterno- "hyoid and sterno.thyroid muscles; and behind are the upper four dorsal vertebrae and the lower ends of the longus colli muscles. It contains the trachea, "oesophagus and thoracic duct; the whole of ihe transverse part of the arch of " the aorta, the innominate artery, and those parts of the left common carotid " and subclavian arteries which are contained within the thorax; the innominate "veins and upper part of the superior vena cava; the phrenic and pneumo-gastrio " nerves, the left recurrent, and the cardiac nerves; and the cardiac lymphatic " glands and remains of the thymus gland."—{Quain's Anatomy, Vol. II., p. 477.)246 THE TRACHEA & BRONCHI.

THE BRONCHI Commence opposite the 3rd dorsal vertebra a little to the left of the middle line; the internal septum which marks the separation of the two tubes being slightly deviated to the left by the preponderance in diameter of the right bronchus over the left one. Both divide in the root of the lung into a large inferior and a somewhat smaller superior branch, the former of which, on the right side, givea off a small branch to the middle lobe of the right lung. RIGHT BRONCHUS - About an inch in length, wider, more horizontal than the left one; enters root of lung opposite 4th dorsal vertebra. - It lies behind the superior vena cava & the right auricle; the right pulmonary artery lies at first below it, and then in front of it; the vena azygos major arches over it from behind.

Receives: Tributary Brandies! - Four or five lower intercostal veins of left side, several small mediastinal, oesophageal dr» spinal veins. LEFT UPPER AZYGOS — Receives the blood from those left intercostal veins, usually two or three in number, which are situated between the intercostal veins that open into the left lower azygos and those that open into the left superior inter- costal. It therefore varies greatly in size, diminishing as these latter veins in. crease, & vice versa ; often it does not exist at all, or one or more of the 5th, 6th, & 7th left intercosal veins may merely open directly into the vena azygos major. When there is a distinct left upper azygos, it opens either into the azygos major, or into the left lower azygos. A few imperfect valves are found in the main azygos vein; distinct; valves are found, m the intercostal veins.249 THE THOBACIC & EIGHT LYMPHATIC DUCTS. THORACIC DUCT — Commenoes in receptaculum chyli, passes through aortio opening of diaphragm, and then ascends in front of spine as high as 4th dorsal vertebra, /ying behind oesophagus, between aorta & vena azygos major. It then inclines to the left, and ascends first behind arch of aorta and then behind first portion of subclavian artery of left side; and finally, opposite upper border of 7th cervical vertebra, it arches forwards above pleura & in front of scalenus anticus, and opens into angle of junction between left internal jugular & subclavian veins, its opening being guarded by a pair of valves. It is eomewhat tortuous in its course, constricted at intervals on acoount of the valves it contains j of the size of a goose-quill at its commencement, somewhat narrower in the thorax, again enlarged at the root of the neck. Sometimes it bifurcates, its left division taking the usual course, its right division joining the right lymphatic duct. - It is the common trunk of all the lymphatics of the body, except those of the right side of the head, neck, & thorax, right upper limb, right lung, right side of the heart, & part of the convex surface of the liver. Receptaculum.

Presents for examination the fibrous rings of the arterial & auriculo.ventricular openings, and the muscular fibres. FIBROUS RINGS — The aortic & the two auriculo-ventricnlar rings lie close together behind the centre of the sternum on a level with the 3rd costal cartilages, and are bound together by a fibrocartilaginous mass which becomes ossified in some of the larger animals. - The aortic ring lies in front of the left auriculo-ventricnlar; the right auriculo-ventiicular ring lies between, & to the right of, the two others. - The fibrous ring of the pulmonary artery is situated at the apex of the infundibulum opposite the upper border of the 3rd costal cartilage of the left side close to the sternum. These rings give attachment to the mitral .tricuspid & semilunar valves, to the muscular fibres of the auricles, and to some of the most superficial fibres of the ven- tricles. The margin of the arterial rings which is turned towards the auricles, is scalloped into three semilunar notches filled up by corresponding projections of the middle coat of the artery, the attachment of the arteries to the rings being strength- ened externally by the pericardium and internally by the endocardium. MUSCULAR FIBRES — Are striated, but are about £ smaller than those of striated mus- cles generally, and their striation is not so distinct. They divide and anastomose with each other, and they often contain fat cells. Their perimysium is but scanty. Fibres Of the Auricles - Are mostly transverse, superficial, & common to both auricle3; some however lie deeper, and are proper to each auricle. Superficial, Transverse, or Common Fibres - Surround maiuly the base of the sinuses, and are most marked anteriorly. Some dip into the inter- auricular septum. Deep or Proper Fibres - May be divided into: Looped Fibres - Arch over each auricle from before backwards, and are at. tached to the auriculo-ventricular rings both in front & behind. Annular Fibres - Encircle the appendices auriculae, and the venae cavae, pul- monary & coronary veins, extending for some distance upon the veins. Fibres of the Ventricles - Vide next Tablet.253 STRUCTURE of the HEART—2nd Tablet. FIBKES OP THE VENTKICLES Form seven layers differing from eaoh other by the direction of their fibres. These layers are continuous with each other at the apex & at the base of the heart as follows : - the 1st, or most external layer, with the 7th, or most internal layer. „ 2nd, „ 6th, „ 3rd, „ 5th, The fibres of the 4th or central layer return upon those of the same set. Together, the 1st & 7th layers form a kind of double ring inclosing all the other layers; the 2nd and 6th layers, a kind of double ring inclosing the 3rd, 4th, and 5th layers; the 3rd and 5th layers, a kind of double ring: inclosing the 4th layer. As a conse- quence the double ring formed by the 1st and 7fch layers extends farther towards the apex & the base of the heart than the double ring formed by the 2nd & 6fch lavers, which latter double ring extends farther than the double ring formed by the 3rd & 5th layers ; and the 4th or central layer is the least extensive of all. This explains the greater thickness of the walls of the ventricles towards the middle of their length than at either extremity. - The outer layers, it may be added, are thinner than the inner ones. The fibres of the three outer layers are inclined downwards & to the left on the anterior aspect of the heart, downwards & to the right on the posterior aspect; and they become less vertical in each successive layer. The fibres of the 4th layer are horizontal or transverse. The fibres of the three inner layers are inclined upwards & to the left on the anterior aspect of the heart, upwards & to the right on the posterior aspect, crossing the fibres of the three outer layers, and becoming more & more vertical or longitudinal in the successive strata. Some of the superficial fibres, especially those of the posterior surface, pass round and en- close both ventricles; the mass of the fibres, however, enclose but one ventricle. In the three outer layers the anterior fibres proper to the left ventricle issue from the inner & front part of the corresponding arterial & auriculo-ventricular openings & from tho front of the interventricular septum; these anterior fibres pass downwards & to the left, with a few of the anterior common superficial fibres, and get to the back part of the apex. The posterior fibres proper to the left ventricle issue from the outer & back part of the corresponding arterial & auriculo-ventricular openings & from the back of the interventricular septum; these posterior fibres pass downwards & to the right, with a somewhat considerable number of the posterior common superficial fibres, and get to the front of the apex. Here all the fibres, both anterior & posterior, curl inwards in a whirl-like manner, the anterior fibres going to form the three inner strata on the posterior wall of the ventricle, and the posterior fibres going to form the three inner strata on the anterior wall. In the right ventricle the fibres of the three outer layers issue partly from the correspond- ing arterial & auriculo-ventricular openings, and are partly continuous with the posterior common superficial fibres. Descending spirally from left to right on the posterior aspect of the heart, and from right to left on the anterior aspect, they reach the anterior interventricular groove. Here a few fibres are continued on to the left ventricle, forming the anterior common superficial fibres; the greater number pass backwards, however, in the interventricular septum, at the back of which they decus- sate with the fibres of the left ventricle, and blend with the posterior common super- superficial fibres. It must be added that none of the fibres, except a few of the most superficial ones, can now be said to arise from the arterial & auriculo-ventricular rings. The strata are merely continued opposite these rings, the superficial ones into the deep ones, and vice versa.254 NERVES of the HEART Are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which plexuses are formed by the cardiac branches of the sympathetic and of the pneumogastric & recurrent laryngeal. CARDIAC NERVES ~ Are the three cardiac nerves of the sympathetic, the cervical- cardiac & the thoracic.cardiac nerves of the pneumogastric, and the cardiac bran- ches of the recurrent laryngeal. CARDIAC NERVES OF THE SYMPATHETIC - Are three in number, superior or superficial, middle or great, 6° inferior, and arise normally from the cor- responding cervical ganglia. The' superior cardiac nerve, however, frequently arises partly from the communicating cord below the superior ganglion, and the inferior one partly from the first dorsal ganglion j when the middle ganglion is absent the middle cardiac nerve arises from the communicating cord between the superior & inferior ganglia. These nerves pass downwards & inwards to the base of the heart either singly or in con- nection with each other or with the other cardiac nerves, varying considerably in their relative size and in their precise relations to adjoining structures} when one of them is smaller than usual one of the others is increased in size. On the right side of the neck the superior 6° the middle cardiac nerves pass downwards behind the common carotid artery, the former passing also in front of the inferior thyroid artery & recurrent laryngeal nerve. They then cross the subclavian artery either in front or behind, and descend upon the trachea to the right side of the great or deep cardiac plexus. - On the left side the superior cardiac nerve usually descends into the thorax between &* in front oftYiQ left common carotid 6° left subclavian arteries and crosses anteriorly the arch of the aorta to the superfi~ rial cardiac plexus ; sometimes however it lies deeper than usual and then passes behind the aorta to the deep cardiac plexus. - The left ??iiddle cardiac nerve passes into the thorax between &> behind the left common carotid &> left subclavian arteries^ and then descends behind the arch of the aorta to the left side of the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerve passes downwards & inwards to the deep cardiac plexus behind the subclavian artery, and also, on the right side, behind the innominate. CARDIAC NS. of the PNEUMOGASTRIC & RECURR. LARYNGEAL Are divided into: Cervical Cardiac - Are divided into: Upper Cervical Cardiac - Small branches which join the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic. Lower Cervical Cardiac - One large branch which, on the right side, des- cends along the innominate artery and joins one of the cardiac nerves destined to the deep cardiac plexus, and, on the left side, crosses the arch of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. Thoracic Cardiac - Arise on the right side both from the trunk of the pneumo* gastric & from its recurrent laryngeal branch, but on the left side from the recurrent branch only. They all go to the deep cardiac plexus either singly or in connection with the other deep cardiac nerves.255 THE CARDIAC PLEXUSES. The cardiac nerves form two primary cardiac plexuses termed the superficial & the deep or great, and two secondary plexuses, the anterior & the posterior coronary, which two latter plexuses are derived from the preceding, as are also in part the anterior & the posterior pulmonary plexuses. SUPERFICIAL CARDIAC PLEXUS — The smaller. Is situated beneath arch of aorta in front of right pulmonary artery and on right side of ductus arteriosus. It com- municates by several filaments with the left half of the deep cardiac plexus. It is formed by the left superior cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, the left inferior cervical cardiac branch of the pneumogastric, and by several filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. It often presents a small ganglion, the ganglion of Wrisberg. It gives off the greater part of anterior coronary plexus, and several filaments to anterior pulmonary plexus of left side. DEEP OR GREAT CARDIAC PLEXUS — The larger. Is situated between trachea & arch of aorta, its right half lying above right branch of pulmonary artery, its left half lying rather on left side of trachea and being connected by several filaments with the superficial plexus. It is usually formed by every one of the cardiac nerves excepting the left superior cardiac nerve of sympathetic & left inferior cervical cardiac nerve of pneumogastric. Its right half sends branches - behind right pulmonary artery to posterior coronary plexus & to right auricle; - in front of right pulmonary artery, outwards, to right anterior pulmonary plexus, inwards, in front of pulmonary trunk to anterior coronary plexus. - Its left half gives off: - several filaments to superficial cardiac plexus, numerous fiia- ments to posterior coronary plexus & to left auricle, a few branches to left anterior pulmonary plexus. ANTERIOR CORONARY PLEXUS — la derived chiefly from the superficial cardiao plexus, but partly also from the deep. It passes forwards between aorta & pulmonary artery and accompanies the left or antei-ior coronary artery & its branches. POSTERIOR CORONARY PLEXUS — Is derived chiefly from the left half of the deep cardiac plexus, but partly also from the right. Its branches accompany the right of posterior coronary artery and its branches. The filaments of the coronary plexuses ramify in the substance of the heart and beneath the pericardium & endocardium. Numerous small ganglia are found upon them, especially in the vicinity of the boundary ring3 between the auricles & ventricles. SPLANCHNIC NERVES.

The last one is usually stellate in shape, and is sometimes blended with the first lumbar. - They present: Hoots, or Branches of Communication with the Dorsal Nerves - Usually two in number: - Either both ascend obliquely upwards & outwards to join the dorsal nerve above just before its bifurcation, or one ascends as above de- scribed, and the other descends to join the dorsal nerve below in corres- ponding situation. Sometimes one or two ganglia have a third root resulting from bifurcation of one of the roots to adjoining dorsal nerves, and even, occasionally, an additional root to second dorsal nerve above. Internal Branches, or Branches op Distribution - Those from five or six upper gang- lia are small & greyish; they mainly supply thoracic aorta & its branches, & bodies of vertebrae & their ligaments; those from third & fourth ganglia join posterior pulmonary plexus. Those from six or seven lower ganglia are larger & whiter j they give off a few small branches to aorta, and join to form the great, lesser, & last splanchnic nerves (V. Solar Plexus).

It is thin, and of a pale rosy colour. It is particularly thin & adherent over the epiglottis, and still more so over the true vocal cords, where it is transparent enough for the ligamentous fibres to be seen through its substance. Its epithelium is columnar ciliated below the superior vocal cords, and also, in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis; above these points it loses its cilia, and gradu. ally assumes the squamous form. It is squamous over the true vocal cords. It is highly sensitive in the upper part of the larynx. MUCOUS GLANDS — Simple tubular, and conglomerate; particularly abundant over the posterior surface of the epiglottis, in which situation they are received into num- erous small pits in the substance of the cartilage; but they are found everywhere beneath the mucous membrane, excepting over the true vocal cords. The glands of the sacculus laryngis, from 60 to 70 in number, pour out their secretion upon the in- ferior or true vocal cords which it is destined to lubricate. The so-called arytenoid glands are collected into a somewhat large mass in the arytaano-epiglottidean folds, in front of the arytenoid cartilages. VESSELS & NERVES — Arteries. Are the laryngeal branches of the superior & inferior thyroid. - Veins. Open into the superior, middle & inferior thyroid. - Lym- phatics. Terminate in the deep cervical glands. - Nerves. Are the superior and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric, and filaments from the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerve supplies the mucous membrane, the crico-thyroid muscle, & in part the arytenoid; the inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies in part the arytenoid, and all the other muscles, excepting the crico* thyroid.262 THE LARYNX—5th Tablet. INTERIOR of the LARYNX. Is divided in two by the glottis or ritna glottidis. GLOTTIS or RIM A GLOTTIDIS — Anteroposterior opening comprised be- tween the inferior or true vocal cords in its anterior three-fourths, and between the arytaenoid cartilages in its posterior fourth. In tranquil breathing it is triangular with base backwards. It is lozenge- shaped when fully dilated, as in violent inspirations. It is reduced to a narrow slit when sound is emitted; the vocal cords then lying parallel to each other, and their degree of approximation & tension increasing with the height of the Bound produced. In the adult male it is nearly an inch long, and may be dilated to nearly half an inch. In the female, and in the male before puberty, its dimensions are about one-third less. Inferior Or True Vocal Cords - Extend from near middle of receding angle of thyroid cartilage below the false vocal cords to anterior or internal angle of the base of the arytaenoid cartilages. They consist of a strong band of yellow elastic fibrous tissue, the inferior thyro-arytcenoid ligament, which band is continuous inferiorly with the lateral portion of the crico- thyroid membrane, is covered internally by a very thin & adherent layer of mucous membrane, and is strengthened externally by the thyro- arytsenoid muscle. PART ABOVE the GLOTTIS — !s broad & triangular, & presents for exami- nation : — Superior Aperture Of the Larynx - Triangular, obliquely inclined downwards & backwards, and bounded in front by the epiglottis, & laterally by the arytaeno-epiglottidean folds. Superior Or False Vocal Cords - Extend from near middle of receding angle of thyroid cartilage above the true vocal cords to the anterior surface of the arytaenoid cartilages; they consist of a fold of mucous membrane con- taining a thin band of yellow elastic fibrous tissue, the superior thyro- arytenoid ligament, from which a delicate expansion extends over the sacculus laryngis. They bound superiorly the openings of the Ventricle Of the Larynx - Deep oblong saccular depression comprised between the superior & inferior vocal cords, and corresponding externally to the thyro-arytaenoid muscle. It is continued superiorly & in front by a nar- row opening into the Sacculus Laryngis or Laryngeal Pouch - A prolongation of the foregoing, which passes upwards & forwards between the superior vocal cord & the thyroid cartilage, and is covered externally by the thyro- epiglottideus & by the thin upper fasciculus of the thyro-arytaenoid, and internally by the arytaeno-epiglottideus inferior or compressor sacculi laryngis. The mucous lining of the pouch is supported by an expansion from the superior vocal cord, and presents the openings of from 60 to 70 mucous glands, whose secretion lubricates the inferior vocal cords. PART BELOW the GLOTTIS — Is flattened from side to side above, circular below, continuous inferiorly with canal of trachea.THE NERVE CENTRES THEIR COVERINGS.COVEEINGS of the BRAIN & CORD—1st Tablet. The immediate coverings of both are three in number, and though presenting marked differ- ences, they bear the same names, dura mater, arachnoid <2r» pia mater* THE DURA MATER — Is a thick, dense, fibrons membrane, which is lined internally by the parietal layer of the arachnoid. Dura Mater of the Brain - Forms the internal periosteum of the skull; it is pro- longed round all the cranial nerves, blending with their sheaths and becoming at their point of exit continuous with the pericranium; it is also prolonged into the orbit. Its outer surface is rough & fibrillated; it is most adherent opposite the sutures at the base of the skull, and presents superiorly numerous glandulae Pacchionii. Its inner surface is smooth; it sends three processes inwards, the falx cerebri and the tentorium & falx cerebelli, in the attached margins of which processes are re- pectively contained the superior longitudinal, the lateral & superior petrosal, & the occipital sinuses, the falx cerebri having also the inferior longitudinal sinus in its free margin. Its arteries are derived from the middle & small meningeal, and from the meningeal branches of the anterior & posterior ethmoidal, internal carotid, ascending pharyn- geal, occipital & vertebral, which arteries however supply principally the bones of the skull. Its veins, with the exception of the two which accompany the middle meningeal, join with the diploic veins and open into the sinuses. - Its nerves are small branches from the fourth cranial nerve, the Casserian ganglion, the ophthal- mic branch of the fifth, the eighth, & the sympathetic. Dura Mater of the Cord - Differs from that of the brain in that it does not form the internal periosteum of the bodies & laminae of the vertebrae, which periosteum is a distinct fibrous membrane separated from the dura mater by loose areolar tissue & by a plexus of veins, in that it sends no prolongations inwards, contains no sinuses, and forms, especially in the cervical & lumbar regions, but a loose sheath round the cord and the roots of the spinal nerves. It is attached superiorly to the circumference of the foramen magnum, and anteriorly it is slightly adherent along its whole length to the posterior common ligament of the spine. Laterally when viewed from within, it is seen to give attachment to the processes of the ligamentum denticulatum, and to present a double series of foramina for the passage of the anterior & posterior roots of the nerves; when viewed from without it is seen to form a separate sheath to the roots of the nerves as far as their point of junction, and then to be continued upon the nerves, forming part of their neurilemma. Opposite the termination of the cord it blends with the pia mater to form the ligamen- tum centrale, which passes down to the back of the coccyx, and which, in its upper part,vcontains the filiform prolongation of the grey matter of the cord termed the filum terminale.COVERINGS of the BRAIN & CORD-2nd Tablet. THE ARACHNOID Is a serous membrane of which the parietal layer lines the dura mater with a layer of squamous epithelial cells, while the visceral layer surrounds the brain & cord, from which it is sepa- rated by the subarachnoidean space. Visceral Layer of the Arachnoid of the Brain — On the upper surface of the hemispheres it is thin & transparent, and passes over the convolutions without dipping into the sulci. - At the base of the brain it is thicker and slightly opaque Crossing from side to side between the two temporo-sphenoidal lobes and between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum & the medulla oblongata, it bounds inferiorly the anterior &> posterior subarachnoidean spaces. It is reflected round the cranial nerves in the shape of loose sheaths as far as their point of exit from the skull, where it becomes continuous with the pai'ietal layer. Visceral layer of the Arachnoid of the Cord — Forms, especially in the lower part, but a loose sheath round the cord & the roots of the nerves. This sheath is single round the two roots of each spinal nerve, and is continued as far as their exit from the dura mater; the arachnoid is also reflected over the processes oi the ligamentum dentioulatum. THE SUBARACHNOIDEAN SPACE Is comprised between the pia mater & the visceral layer of the arachnoid, and contains the cerebro-spinal fluid. It usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain by an opening in the layer of pia mater which bounds the fourth ventricle inferiorly. It is narrow on the surfa3e of the hemispheres, but is greatly expanded both at the base of the brain in the situation of the anterior & posterior subarachnoidean spaces, and also round the spinal cord. It is crossed by numerous fibrous bands in the situation of the base of the brain and at the upper part of the back of the cord, and is partly subdivided by an incomplete membranous septum which connects the arachnoid with the pia mater opposite the posterior median fissure. N.B.—This being essentially a work on Descriptive Anatomy, it has not been thought desirable to alter at present the old description of the Arachnoid as a serous membrane. 32266 COVERINGS of the BEAIN & O0RD-3rd Tablet. THE PIA MATER On the cerebrum & cerebellum the pia mater is a delicate areolar membrane, very thin & vascular. It is thick, dense, and but slightly vascular, on the pons, the crura cerebri & the cord. It is everywhere intimately adherent to the nervous substance; it dips down between the convolutions of the cerebrum and the laminee of the cerebellum, and passes into the ante- rior and posterior median fissures of the cord 5 it is prolonged upon the nerves and their roots. The pia mater of the brain penetrates into the ventricular cavities through the transverse fissure, and forms the velum interpositum and the choroid plexuses. - It usually presents an opening at the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle, by which opening the subarach- noidean space of the brain & cord communicates with the ventricular cavities of the brain. The pia mater of the cord presents anteriorly the linea splendens, a whitish longitudinal fibrous band, and laterally, the ligamentum denticulatum. This latter descends along the whole length of the side of the cord between the anterior & the posterior roots of the nervesj its outer edge is denticulated; the denticulations, about twenty.two in number, cross the subarachnoidean space with the arachnoid reflected over them, and become attached to the dura mater in the intervals of the successive pairs of spinal nerves, The first denticu- lation is situated opposite the foramen magnum, between the vertebral artery & the hypo, glossal nerve. — Opposite the termination of the cord the pia mater blends with the dura mater to form the ligamentum centrale, which latter passes down to the back of the coccyx, and, in its upper part, contains the filiform prolongation of the grey matter of the cord, termed the filum terminale.267 THE SURFACE of the CEREBRUM.

Marginal Convolution - Forms the lateral boundary of the anterior half of the longitudinal fissure. Beginning at the anterior perforated space, it first passes forwards on the inner side of the olfactory sulcus as far as the apex of the frontal lobe, and then curves upwards & backwards along the upper margin of the hemisphere to a little behind the fissure of Rolando. Convolution of the Corpus Callosum or Gyrus Fornicatus - Begins anteriorly with the foregoing, and then winds backwards along the convex surface of the corpus callosum from which it is separated by the so.called ventricle.

TRANSVERSE FISSURE OP THE BRAIN Is of a horse-shoe shape, and about 3 inches wide. Its central part is horizontal and comprised between the tabercnla quadrigemina & the posterior extremity or splenium of the corpus callosum. Its lateral portions curve downwards & forwards, and are comprised between the optic thalami & crura cerebri below & in front and the hippocampi majores & corpora fimbriata above & behind. This fissure transmits the pia mater into the interior of the brain. INTRA-CEREBRAL PORTION OF THE PIA MATER Forms on the one hand the velum interpositum & the choroid plexuses of the lateral & the 3rd ventricles, and, on the other, the choroid plexuses of the 4th ventricle. VelUHl Interposituni - Is a triangular fold of pia mater which is reflected into the interior of the brain through the transverse fissure. It presents : Central Portion - Invests pineal gland, and covers under surface of fornix. From the under surface of this central portion two small vascular fringes, the _ choroid plexuses of the 3rd ventricle, hang down into the latter cavity. Lateral Mabgins - Spread out on either side beneath the corresponding margin of the fornix & its continuation, the corpus fimbriatum, into the body & des- cending cornu of the corresponding lateral ventricle, resting, as do the margins of the fornix, upon the optic thalami. These lateral margins are thick, convoluted & fringe-like; they constitute the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles further described below. Posterior Margin or Base - Is turned backwards towards the transverse fissure. It is continuous with the general pia mater ; it receives the anterior & posterior choroid arteries and emits the venge Galeni. Anterior Bifid Extremity - Continuous through the foramina of Monro with the anterior pointed extremities of the lateral margins above described or choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles. Choroid Plexuses of the Lateral Ventricles - Are nothing more than the thick, convoluted & fringe-like margins of the velum interpositum. When they are described separately, that is to say irrespectively of the velum interpositum of which they are a portion, they may be said to penetrate into the descend, ing cornua of the lateral ventricle through the lateral portions of tho transverse fissure. Hence they ascend into the body of the lateral ventri- cle along the side of the corpus fimbriatum, winding round the posterior extremity of the optic thalamus. Then continuing along the side of tho '< fornix, they taper to a point, and passing through the corresponding fora- men of Monro, they join with each other and with the anterior bifurcated extremity of the central & thinner portion of the velum interpositum. Choroid Plexuses of the 3rd Ventricle - Are two small vascular fringes which hang down from the under surface of the central portion of the velum ; interpositum into the cavity of the 3rd ventricle j they diverge slightly behind. ! Choroid Plexuses Of the 4th Ventricle - Are two similar fringes which project into the 4th ventricle from the layer of pia mater whioh closes that ventri- cle inferiorly; they pass upwards & outwards from near the point of tho inferior vermiform process to the outer margin of tho restiform body.275 THE THIRD VENTRICLE As a narrow median fissure comprised between the optic thalami, and extending to the base of the brain.

Lateral Walls - Formed by inner surface of optic thalami, which surface is bounded above by superior peduncles of pineal gland, and is covered below by part of the grey matter of the third ventricle prolonged upwards from its floor. - The lateral walls are joined together by the middle or soft commissure, a transverse band of grey matter continuous with the remainder of the grey matter of the 3rd ventricle. Ant. Extremity - Formed by anterior crura of fornix. In front of these is the anterior commissure, a transverse band of white fibres, which perforates laterally the corpora striata & spreads out into the substance of both hemispheres. - Between the crura & the optic thalami are the foramina of Monro, through which the lateral & 3rd ventricles communicate, and the anterior extremities of the velum interpositum pass from the 3rd into the lateral ventricles to form the choroid plexuses of the latter. Post. Extremity - Formed by posterior commissure, a transverse band of white fibres con- necting posteriorly the optic thalami. Below this is the opening of the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculura, and above are the tubercula quadrigemina & the pineal gland. For parts above mentioned see foregoing Tablets. N •276 THE CEREBELLUM. I Oblong from side to side & flattened from above downwards. Presents two surfaces & a cir- cumference, and consists of two lateral hemispheres connected by a median lobe, the vermiform process, which latter is divided into two parts, the superior & the inferior. UPPER SURFACE — Flattened on either side, slightly elevated in the centre. Presents! Superior Vermiform Process - Presents from before backwards three slight elevations, the Lobulus Centralis, Monticulus Cerebelli, & Commissuea Simplex, which latter joins with the commissura brevis of the inferior vermiform process. Lateral Hemispheres - Divided by a deep fissure into Anterior on Square Lobe, the anterior, inner & broader portion, and the Posterior or Semilunar Lobe, the narrow, posterior or marginal portion. UNDER SURFACE — Rounded & elevated laterally and depressed in the centre. Presents: Inferior Vermiform Process-Lies in a deep depression, the valley ox vallecula com- prised between the two hemispheres, and presents from behind forwards the Commissura Brevis, Pyramid & Uvula, the former of which joins with the com- missura simplex of the superior vermiform process. The uvula is situated between the two tonsils, with which it is connected by a grey commissure the furrowed band. Its rounded apex, the nodule or laminated tubercle of Malacarne projects into the 4th ventricle, and is con- nected with the flocculi by a thin valvular fold of white substance, the posterior medullary velum or commissura ad flocculum, which fold is partly covered in & concealed by the tonsils. Lateral Hemispheres - Present five lobes: Flocculus, Sub-Peduncular Lobe, or Pneumogastric Lobule - Prominent tuft subdivided into several small laminae and situated below & behind the middle peduncle of the cerebellum, behind the roots of the pneumogastrio nerve. i Amygdala or Tonsil - Rather larger than foregoing and similarly subdivided; projects into the valley on either side of the uvula, to which it is connected by the furrowed band. Digastric Lobe - Corresponds in situation to the anterior part of the square lobe of the upper surface. Slender Lobe - Corresponds in situation to the posterior part of the foregoing square lobe. Posterior Inferior Lobe - Corresponds in situation to the posterior or semilu- nar lobe. CIRCUMFERENCE — Deeply notched in front & behind by the Incisure Cerebelli Anterior & Posterior, - Of which the former embraces the tubercula quadrigemina & the superior peduncles, while the latter receives the falx cerebelli ; - also divided into upper & lower lips by the Great Horizontal Fissure - Which extends uninterruptedly from one middle • peduncle to the other. The other fissures are more or less parallel to the foregoing, and describe more or less concentric curves concave forwards & inwards; some fissures however are more or less oblique, and coalesce with the others so as not to extend over the whole breadth of the hemispheres. The largest fissures separate the lobes above described, the smaller ones demarcate the laminae or folia, which latter cover the surface of the cerebellum and project also into the bottom of the larger fissures.277 THE PEDUNCLES of the CEREBELLUM. Superior, or Processus e Cerebello ad Testes - Arises in the laminae of the inferior vermiform process and also in the interior of the corpus dentatum, passes upwards & inwards on either side of the middle line, being joined to its fellow by the valve of Vieussens, and ascends beneath the tubercula quadrigemina to the crura cerebri & optic thalami, partly decussating in the middle line. Middle, Processus e Cerebello ad Pontem or Cms Cerebelli - The great transverse commissure of the cerebellum. Connects the laminae of the lateral parts of one hemisphere to the corresponding laminae of the opposite side, and forms the pons Varolii & the deep transverse fibres of the mesocephalon. Inferior, or Processus e Cerebello ad Medullam - if traced from below upwards, it may be said to proceed from all three columns of the cord, i.e.t from the postero-external bundles of the anterior & middle columns, & from the fasciculus cuneatus or external bundle of the posterior column, the latter bundle being much the largest of the three. It ends in the laminaa of the middle part of the cerebellum, especially in those of the upper surface.THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The upper enlarged part of spinal cord. Extends from lower border of Pons Varolii, atoove, to point of decussation of anterior pyramids^ below, which point corresponds pretty nearly to upper border of atfas. Flattened from above downwards and forwards, and presents: Antero-inferior Aspect - Rests upon basilar greove. Postero-superior. Aspect - Forms part superiorly of floor of 4th ventricle, and is con- tinuous inferiorly with posterior surface of cord. Divided, as is the cord, mto two lateral halves, by Antero-Median Fissure- Continuous below with that of cord, being partly interrupted, however, by decussation of anterior pyramids. Terminates above, just below the pons, in a small recess, the foramen ccecum. Postero-Median Fissure - Continued above into ventricle of Arantius & postero. median fissure on floor of 4th ventricle, and below into postero-median fissure of cord. SURFACE OP THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Each half presents from before backwards between the two median fissures i Anterior Pyramid - Pyramidal-shaped bundle of white fibres, the apparent pro- longation of anterior column of cord ; narrow below, enlarged and rounded off above, constricted just below the pons. Gives origin in its upper part to 6th cranial nerve. Olivary Body - Oval prominent mass broader above than below, shorter than, but about as broad as, the pyramid. - It is separated from the pyramid by a narrow groove, which gives origin to 9th or hypo-glossal nerve, and from the lower part of which numerous arciform fibres are seen to proceed. These wind upwards and outwards round lower end of olivary body, sometimes crossing its surface. A few arciform fibres emerge from the anterior median fissure, and cross anterior aspect of pyramid (Sappey, Hirschfeld). Lateral Tract - Is continuous with lateral column of cord. It is broad below, where it includes all that part of the medulla comprised between anterior pyramid and restiform body ; above it is pushed backwards, and is narrowed, by the pro- jection of the olivary body. It is separated from restiform body by a slight groove situated in a line with posterior lateral fissure of cord, and gives origin from above downwards to the facial, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric & spinal accessory nerves. Restiform Body or Fasciculus Cuneatus - Is the outer & larger, while the Posterior Pyramid or Fasciculus Gracilis - Is the inner & smaller portion of a wide & thick bundle of white fibres continuous below with posterior column of cord, which bundle diverges from its fellow superiorly, and thus both exposes grey matter of floor of 4th ventricle and forms lower part of lateral boundary of that cavity. This wide & thick bundle used to be called, and is still sometimes called the restiform body. - From its inner edge there projects inwards a thin lamina of white matter termed the ligula, which may be considered as forming part of roof of 4th ventricle. Opposite apex of calamus scriptorius the posterior pyramid presents an enlargement, the processus davatus. In front of the processus cuneatus, behind & a little below olivary body & in a line with postero-lateral fissure of cord, is a small greyish eminence, the grey ttibercle of Rolando, which is formed by the projection of the substantia gelatinosa.

Linejj Transversa - A few white fibres very variable in number sometimes scarcely recognisable, which emerge from the lower part of the postero-median fis- sure, cross the eminentiae teretes, and join, some of them the crus cere- belli, others the roots of the auditory nerve j a few sometimes ascend to the locus coeruleus. Eminently Teretes - Two spindle-shaped elevations, greyish & slightly marked below, whiter & more prominent above, due to the fasciculi teretes, as they ascend beneath the grey matter on either side of the postero-median fissure. - On either side of these eminences is a Groove, or rather, in well marked bodies, two small fosse, which lie, the posterior, inferior & narrowest one, near the lower extremity of the ventricle, and the anterior, superior & broadest one, opposite the crus cerebelli. The latter fossa leads upwards to the Locus Coikuleus - A bluish spot due to an accumulation beneath the surface, of dark vesicular matter termed the substantia ferruginea. From this spot the Tinea Violacea, - A bluish streak, the continuation upwards of the locus casruleus, ascends on the outer side of the eminentia teres to the opening of the aque- duct of Sylviu3. ROOF — Formed above by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum & the valve of Vieus- sens, below by the tonsils, the inferior vermiform process with the uvula, the nodule or laminated tubercle of Malacarne, & by the posterior medullary velum or commissura ad flocculum.

FOXIS Varolii Or Tuber Annulare - Broad transverse band of white fibres which arch like a bridge from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to the ©ther, forming laterally the middle peduncles of the cerebellum. Presents: - Under Surface - Marked by a median shallow groove for basilar artery. Gives off laterally the two roots, anterior small or motor, posterior large or sensory, of the 5th pair of cranial nerves. Upper Border - The most prominent & the most convex, from beneath which the crura cerebri are seen to emerge. Lower Border - Less prominent & less convex, into which the anterior pyramids, olivary fasciculi & lateral tracts of the medulla are seen to penetrate, and from the anterior aspect of which the 6th cranial nerves are sometimes given off. - Laterally the pons Varolii is continued into the two Middle Peduncles of the Cerebellum or Crura Cerebelli - Which form its two lateral portions. Crura Cerebri - Two thick cylindrical or slightly flattened bundles of white fibres about f of an inch long & rather wider in front than behind, which emerge from the anterior border of the pons and pass forwards & outwards to the corpora striata & optic thalami. They are crossed externally by the 4th nerve & inferiorly by the optic tract, the anterior border of which latter is slightly adherent to them. Their inner border bounds posteriorly the interpeduncular space, and gives origin to the 3rd cranial nerve. They are divided into an under or fasciculated portion & an upper portion or tegmentum, between which two portions is a small mass of grey matter, the locus niger. Inferior Peduncles of the Cerebellum or Processus e Cerebello ad Medullam - Two thick bundles of white fibres which descend from the inner & under part of the cerebellum to the back of the medulla, where they join the processus cuneati. They form the lower part of the lateral boundary of the 4th ventricle. Superior Peduncles of the Cerebellum or Processus e Cerebello ad Testes - Two thick bundles of white fibres which ascend from the upper & inner part of the cere- bellum to the testes, forming part of the roof & of the lateral boundary of the 4th ven. tricle.

It forms the roof of the aqueduct of Sylvius & a part of the roof of the 4th ventricle. Tubercula Quadrigemina - Four small rounded eminences separated by a crucial depression, and situated below the posterior extremity or splenium of the corpus callosum, above & behind the posterior commissure & the 3rd ventricle, above & in front of the super- ior peduncles of the cerebellum & the valve of Vieussens. Anterior or Nates - Are larger, darker, slightly oblong from before backwards,and connected with the optic thalami & the commencement of the optic tracts by two broad white bands, the brachia anteriora. Posterior or Testes - Are smaller, lighter in colour, more exactly rounded, and connected with the optic thalami & the commencement of the optic tracts by two narrower bands, the brachia poste7'iora. Pineal Gland or Conarium - Small conical reddish-grey body situated between the nates, retained in position by a fold of pia mater derived from the under surface of the velum interpositum, and connected with the remainder of the cerebrum by means of a few transverse fibres belonging to the posterior commissure, and also by means of its Peduncles - Two on each side: Anterior or Superior - Run forwards over upper & inner part of optic thalami to anterior crura of fornix, with which they unite. Posterior or Inferior - Descend vertically upon inner surface of optic thalami. The pineal gland consists of grey matter with a few white fibres, and is very vascular. In its interior are ono or two small oavities, which sometimes com- municate with the 3rd ventriole, and which contain a transparent viscid fiuid & a small amount of sabulous matter termed the acervulus cerebri.281 THE SPINAL CORD Extends from point of decussation of anterior pyramids (which point corresponds pretty nearly to the upper border of the atlas) to lower border of body of first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a slender filament, the filum terminale, which descends for a short distance into the ligamentum centrale. Is from 15 to 18 inches long & slightly flattened from before backwards. Presents two enlarge - ments, the cervical and the lumbar.

Gives off 31 pairs of nerves. 34282 STRUCTURE of the SPINAL CORD-3rd Tablet. Continuation Upwards of the White Fibres of the Columns into the Medulla Oblongata. Anterior Column - Is thrust aside in the medulla oblongata by those antero-internal fibres of the lateral column, which, after decussating in the middle line, form the innermost & greater part of the anterior pyramid of the opposite side. It then divides into three bundles as follows: Innermost Bundle - Joins externally the above mentioned antero-internal fibres of the lateral tract, and forms the smaller & outermost part of the anterior pyramid of the same side. Middle Bundle - Surrounds the olivary nucleus, above which it forms, with a few fibres arising from this nucleus, the olivary fasciculus or fillet. External or Posterior Bundle - Passes upwards & backwards to join the processus cuneatus, and goes to form part of the inferior pedunole of the cerebellum. Lateral Column - Divides into three bundles as follows: Antero-Internal Bundle -Passes forwards & inwards between the anterior columns, thrusting these columns aside, and forms, after decussating in the middle line, the innermost & greater part of the anterior pyramid of the opposite side. Middle Bundle - Ascends with the fasciculus gracilis beneath the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle, forming part of the fasciculus teres. External or Posterior Bundle - Passes upwards & backwards to join the fasciculus cuneatus, and goes to form part of the inferior peduncle of the cerebellum. Posterior Column - Divides into two bundles as follows : Internal Bundle or Fasciculus Gracilis - The smaller. Ascends beneath the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle, and goes to form part of the fasci- culus teres. External Bundle or Fasciculus Cuneatus - The larger. Diverges from its fellow at the apex of the calamus scriptorius, and passes upwards & outwards to form the greater part of the inferior peduncle of the cerebellum. N.—The reader is here reminded once for all that by the "continuation" of nerve-fibres referred to in this & other Tablets, the Author means, not the continuation of the individual tubular fibres (respecting the absolute origin & termination of which tubular fibres little is yet positively known), but the continuation of the sevei*al bundles of nerve-fibres, which continuation is marked by the general direction of the fibres.283 STRUCTURE of the MEDULLA OBLONGATA—1st Tablet. Presents for examination longitudinal, antero-posterior & transverse fibres, and grey matter. LONGITUDINAL FIBRES — Form five bundles continuous on the one hand with the columns of the cord, and on the other with the longitudinal fibres of the mesencephalon, i.e., three large ones, anterior pyramid, lateral tract <S° fasciculus cuneatus, and two smaller ones, olivary fasciculus or fillet, 6° posterior pyramid or fasciculus gracilis. Their mode of Continuation with the Columns of the Cord - is as follows: - Anterior Pyramid - With antero-internal bundle of lateral column of opposite side, and with innermost bundle of anterior column of same side. The former bundle forms the innermost decussating & by far greater portion of the anterior pyramid; the latter bundle forms that small outer portion of the ant. pyramid, the fibres of which do not decussate in the middle line. Lateral Tract - With lateral column of same side. Fasciculus Cuneatus - With external & greater part of posterior column, and with external or posterior bundles of anterior & lateral columns all of same side. Olivary Fasciculus or Fillet - Partly with middle bundle of anterior column of same side; its other fibres are derived from the olivary nucleus. Posterior Pyramid or Fasciculus Gracilis - With posterior column of same side. Their mode of Continuation with the Longitudinal Fibres of the Meso-eephalon - Is as follows : - Anterior Pyramid - Ascends through the mesocephalon to the inferior or fasciculated portion of the crus cerebri, from whence its fibres are prolonged to the corpora striata. N.—The cerebellar fibres & the fibres to the olivary body, which are said in some of our best standard works on Anatomy to be derived from the anterior pyramid, are derived not from the anterior pyramid itself, that is to say not from the pyramidal-shaped bundle, which, in the surface description of the cord, is called the "anterior pyramid," but from the middle & external bundles of the anterior column of the cord. (Vide continuation upwards of the white fibres of the columns of the cord into the medulla oblongata). Lateral Tract - Divides into three bundles as follows (or rather it is the lateral /olumrzofthe cord which thus divides, for the division here referred to takes place a little below the point of decussation of the pyramids, that is to say below the point which is usually taken as the boundary between the medulla & the cord): - Antero-internal Bundle - Passes upwards & inwards, decussating with its fellow, and forms the innermost & greater part of the anterior pyramid of the opposite-side. Middle Bundle - Ascends with the fasciculus gracilis beneath the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle, forming part of the fasciculus teres. External or Posterior Bundle - Passes upwards & backwards to join the fasciculus cuneatus, and goes to form part of the inferior peduncle of the cerebellum. Fasciculus Cuneatus - Passes up to the cerebellum with the external or posterior bundles of the anterior & lateral columns of the cord, forming with them the inf. peduncle of the cerebellum. Olivary Fasciculus or Fillet - Divides into two bundles as follows : - Antero-internal Btcndle - Ascends through the mesocephalon with the middle bundle of fibres of the lateral tract, and joins the upper part or tegmentum of the crus cerebri. Postero-extetnal Bundle- Passes upwards & outwards through the mesocephalon, issues from the transverse fibres of the pons externally to the crus cerebri, and finally ascends over the superior peduncle of the cerebellum to the tubercula quadrigemina, decussating with its fellow above the aqueduct of Sylvius. Posterior Pyramid or Fasciculus Geacilis - Ascends with the middle bundle of the lateral column beneath the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle, forming part of the fascicu. lus teres. ANTERO-POSTERIOR FIBRES — Form a median septum most marked at the upper part of the medulla. They partly decussate with each other (Clarke). Some emerge from the antero- median fissure, or pass between the anterior pyramid & the olivary body and emerge below the roots of the 9th nerve; these two sets form the arciform fibres mentioned in the surface de- scription of the medulla. Others emerge from the postero-median fissure, and form the lines transversa of the floor of the 4th ventricle, TRANSVERSE FIBRES — Tne arciform fibres form a superficial set. A deep set join the olivary nuclei & the nuclei contained in the posterior pyramids & processus cuneati. QrREY MATTER -284 ARTERIES of the BASE of the BRAIN. i A-re the anterior & middle cerebral branches of the internal carotid and the posterior cerebral of the basilar, which are joined together by the anterior & posterior communicating'.

The right one is generally somewhat the larger of the two. Torcular Herophili - An irregular expansion of the postero-superior group of sinuses pretty nearly cor- responding in situation to the external ccipital protuberance, and formed by the coalescence of the superior longitudinal, straight & occipital sinuses, which pour their blood into it, and of the lateral sinuses, which convey the blood from the torcular to the internal jugular veins. CaVemOUS Sinuses - Two large but short sinuse3, extending on either side of sella turcica from sphe. noidal fissure to apex of petrous portion of temporal bone, and communicating with each other through circular & transverse sinuses, and with tho lateral sinuses through the superior & info ior petrosal.

Are the anterior abdominal aponeurosis, or abdominal aponeurosis proper, which is strengthened posteriorly hy the fascia transversalis, and the lumbarfascia. ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL APONEUROSIS — Is formed by aponeuroses of external & internal oblique, and by anterior aponeurosis of transversalis, which aponeuroses may be considered as expanded tendons of insertion. They all three assist in forming the linea alba & the sheath of the APONEUROSIS OF EXTERNAL OBLIQUE — The strongest & widest of the three, and widest at its lower part; blended with aponeurosis of internal oblique in front of rectus and for some distance on either side, especially at upper part. Its fibres are oblique downwards & forwards, and form in succession Poupart's ligament, Gimbemat's ligament, Outer or inferior pillar of external abdominal ring, Inner or Superior pillar. Superficial part of liuea alba by decussating with their fellows, and perhaps also after decussating, the Triangular ligament & the Intercolum- nar fibres of the opposite side. Poupart's Ligament - Strong curved band extending from anterior superior spine of ilium to spine of pubes, convex downwards & outwards, blended interiorly with iliac fascia, internally with outer pillar of external abdominal ring, posteriorly with deep crural arch. Gimbemat's Ligament - Small triangular process reflected downwards, outwards & backwards - from inner part of Poupart's ligament to ilio-pectineal line, and of which the outer concave margin forms inner boundary of femoral ring. Outer or Inferior Pillar of External Abdominal Ring - Blended with roupart's ligament and attached with it to spine of pubes. Curves round inferior aspect of spermatic cord so as to form a groove upon which the cord rests. Inner or Superior Pillar of External Abdominal Ring - Broad, thin; interlaces with its fellow in front of symphysis. Linea Alba - Vide Below. Triangular Ligament-A triangular band lying behind inner pillar of external abdominal ring & Gimbemat's ligament and in front-of conjoined tendon, and extending from lower part of linea alba to ilio-pectineal line. It is formed according to some anatomists by prolongation across median line of lowest of those fibres of aponeurosis of external oblique of oppsite side which enter into formation of linea alba. Intercolumnar Fibres - Are interwoven at right angles -with, and bind together, the fibres of aponeurosis of external oblique, and more particularly those fibres which form the pillars of external abdominal ring. They extend downwards and outwards from middle & lower parts of linea alba to middle of Poupart's ligament describing curves convex inferiorly, and are said to be the continuation beyond the linea alba of middle fibres of aponeurosis of external oblique of opposite side. - Continuous with this layer of fibres is the intercolunmar or external spermatic fascia, thin closely adherent to margins of exter- nal abdominal ring, and prolonged downwards into a tubular process around cord & testis. APONEUROSIS OF INTERNAL OBLIQUE — Thinner & rather narrower than fore- going, and narrowest at lower part. Divides opposite upper three-fourths of rectus into two layers, which blend, the one with aponeurosis of external oblique, the other with that of transversalis, and which pass, the one in front of, the other behind rectus, and again unite at " linea alba. Passes wholly in front of lower part of rectus. ANTERIOR APONEUROSIS OF TRANSVERSALIS - The narrowest of the three, especi- ally above, where some muscular fibres extend a little behind rectus. Passes behind rectus in its upper three-fourths, blending with posterior layer of aponeurosis of internal oblique. Passes in front of rectus in its lower fourth, blending with aponeurosis of external & internal oblique. SHEATH OF RECTUS — Is therefore complete in front and incomplete behind, where it corresponds only to upper three-fourths of the muscle ; the deficiency in posterior wall of sheath being marked superiorly by the Fold of Douglas, a well defined fibrous band concave inferiorly. In front it is formed by all three aponeuroses below, but only by aponeurosis of external oblique & anterior layer of aponeurosis of internal oblique, above. Behind, it is formed, where it exists, by aponeurosis of transversalis & posterior layer of aponeurosis of internal oblique. LIJSTEA ALBA — Tendinous raphe from ensiform cartilage to pubes, bounded by inner borders of recti; narrow below & broad above; perforated by numerous vascular & nervous foramina, and by umbilicus, opposite which it is closely adherent to integument. LINEiE SEMILUNARIS — Two curved depressed linear spaces produced on either side of recti, by absence of muscular fibres between these muscles and inner margin of muscular portion of internal oblique & transversalis. POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL APONEUROSIS OR LUMBAR FASCIA - Formed by posterior aponeurosis of transversalis, the postenor layer of which aponeurosis is blended with vertebral aponeurosis and with aponeuroses of latissimus dorsi & serratus posticus inferior. POSTERIOR OR VERTEBRAL APONEUROSIS OF TRANSVERSALIS - Divided mto three layers. Posterior Or Superficial Layer - The strongest. Attached to apices of spinous processes of lumbar & sacral vertebra?, and blends with aponeuroses above mentioned. Gives origin to middle fibres of internal oblique, and binds down erector spina?. Middle Layer - Of considerable strength. Separates erector spina? from quadratus lumborum, and becomes attached to apices of transverse processes of lumbar vertebra). Anterior Layer - The thinnest. Covers anterior aspect of quadratus lumborum, forming super- iorly the liganientum arcuatum externum, and becomes attached to bases of transverse processes*•29?, PUDIC NERVE. From lower part of sacral plexus. With pudic artery through lower part of great sacro-sciatic foramen on inner side of great sciatic nerve. Winds round spine of ischium, and re-enters pelvis through lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, where it gives off inferior hae norrhoidal nerve. Forwards along outer wall ofischio-rectal fossa above pudic artery, both nerve & artery being covered by obturator fascia, and divides into perinaeal nerve & dorsal nerve of the penis. PERINEAL NERVE — The larger. Accompanies superficial perineal artery, and divides into branches: - Cutaneous or Superficial Perinaeal - Two in number: Posterior or Internal - Gives filaments to skin in front of anus (and to the sphincter ani, Gray), and communicates with the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. It then passes forwards to the scrotum or labium on the inner side of the following nerve with which it communicates anteriorly. Anterior or External - Forwards on outer side of foregoing to scrotum & integu- ment of'peni3, or labium. Communicates with foregoing, and with inferior pudendal, and gives a few twigs to levator ani. Muscular - Generally arise by a common trunk, which passes forwards and inwards under cover of transversus perinsei, and supplies anterior extremity of sphincter ani, transversus perinsei, erector penis, accelerator urinae & com- pressor urethrae; a twig is given to the bulb of the urethra. DORSAL NERVE OP THE PENIS — The smaller. With pudic artery along rami of ischium & pubes between the two layers of d°ep p rinse il fascia, and through suspensory l;gament and along dorsum of penis to glans. Supplies skin of dorsum & sides of penis, and gives a large branch to corpus cavernosum. - Dorsal nerve oj clitoris in female is smaller, but similarly distributed Inferior Hemorrhoidal Nerve - May be derived directly from sacral plexus. Crosses ischio-rectal fossa towards lower end of rectum, and gives off num- erous branches to sphincter ani & integument round anus 5 communicates with superficial perinaeal & inferior pudendal. INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY. (Vide page 159.)

Laryngeal - Upon trachea to back of larynx; supplies muscles & mucous mem- brane. Thacheal - Join below with bronchial. (Esophageal - Descend upon oesophagus.294 THE CLASSIFICATION of JOINTS. The joints may be divided into: SYNARTHROSES — The bones are immoveably interlocked, and are in almost imme- diate contact, being separated only by a thin layer of periosteum termed the sutural ligament, and, at the base of the skull, by a thin layer of cartilage. - The varieties are the: Sutura Vera - The bones present a series of processes & indentations, which fit in with each other. The subvarieties are the: S. Dentata - The interlocking processes are large & ramified. - Ex.: Sagittal St* lamboid sutures. S. Sekrata - The interlocking processes are smaller & more regular. - Ex.: Tem- porary suture in middle line of frontal bone. S. Limbosa - The articular surfaces are more or less bevelled, and one overlaps the other. - Ex.: Fronto-parietal suture. Sutura Notha Or False Suture - A mere apposition of rough surfaces. - The subvarieties are the : S. Squamosa - Considerable overlapping of extensively bevelled surfaces. - Ex.: Temporoparietal suture. S. Harmonica - Apposition in the mesial line of two symmetrical & vertically cut surfaces. - Ex.: Articulation betzveen the two halves of the upper jaw. Schindylesis - A thin plate of bone is received into a cleft formed by the separation of the two plates of another bone. - Ex.: Articulation of the rostrum of the sphenoid with the vomer. Gomphosis - The implantation of the teeth into the alveolar processes. ABUPHXARTHROSES — The bones are bound together alniost immoveably by means of thick plates of fibro-cartilage extremely adherent to each bone, and by strong external ligaments. In some cases the articular surfaces are partly covered by a thin layer of cartilage, and are partly lined with synovial membrane. The one class of amphiarthroses resemble the synarthroses, the other class resemble the diarthroses. DIARTHROSES — The bones are bound together by means of external ligaments lined with synovial membrane, and the articular surfaces are covered with cartilage. Plates or rings of fibro-cartilage are sometimes included within the articular cavity, which cavity they occasionally divide into two distinct parts. - The arthrodiaa having recently been subdivided by Cruveilhier into arthi-odiaa proper, condyloid articulations, & articulations by reciprocal reception, the varieties of the diarthroses may now be enumerated as follows (in the order of decreasing variety & decreasing extent of the movements they admit) - : Snarthroses - Globular head received into a cup-shaped cavity. "Well defined capsu- lar ligament. The movements are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, & rotation. - Ex: Hip-joint. Articulations by Reciprocal Reception - Articular surfaces inversely convex in one direction & concave in the other. Capsular ligament less perfect & complete than in the enai-throses. The movements are flexion, extension, adduction, ab- duction, & circumduction j there is no of axial rotation. - Ex: Articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. Condyloid Articulations - Ovoid articular head, or condyle, received into an elliptical cavity. Strong anterior, posterior & lateral ligaments. Flexion & ex« . tension very free; adduction, abduction & circumduction, rather less so; m I axial rotation. Ex: Wrist joint. Ginglymi-Trochlear surface on the one hand, cavity of reception to correspond, on the other. Strong lateral ligaments; anterior & posterior ligaments but slightly marked. Flexion & extension only. Ex: Elbow joint. Diarthroses Rotatorii - Pivot-like process turning in an osteo-fibrous ring, J osteo-fibrous ring rotating upon an axial process. Rotatory movements only. Ex: Stiperior 6° inferior radio-ulnar articulations. Arthrodise Proper - Articular surfaces fiat or nearly so. Thin & loose capsules. Only gliding movements, which movements are never very extensive. Ex: Acromio-clavicular articulation.

62 It is entirely unorganised and resists putrefaction. 5. The rete mucosum adheres indifferently to the corium and epidermis.—Its nature is not well ascertained: by some it is supposed to be an unorganised membrane. Bichat gives the name of corps reticulaire to this substance, considering it as a congeries of the capillary vessels on the external surface of the corium. Others consider it as a mucous secretion from those vessels. It is very visible in the negro. Upon it the colour of the skin depends. 6. The nails are unorganised substances, similar in many respects to the epidermis: of lamellated appearance. The external lamellae is continuous throughout the whole convex surface of the nail, the more internal lamella* extend gradually less and less towards the posterior mar- gin, so that the nail is thickest anteriorly. Mode of connection with the integuments.—The epidermis of the upper surface of the fingers or toes, leaving the true skin projects a little beyond its margin, and is reflected for a short space on its inner surface. With this reflected portion of the epidermis the substance of the nail is conti- nuous by its posterior margin, in such a way that the lower concave surface of the nail may he considered as the epidermis of the subjacent portion of the finger or toe: near the end of the nail the epidermis leaves it to be continued over the extremity of the joint, and a free margin of the nail projects. 7. Hair. The form and quantity of the hair is very different in different parts of the body. The structure of a hair is the same in all. It consists of a cylindrical or oval bulb, and a body which tapers gradually. The bulb is situated in the subcutaneous adipose or cellular substance, and is contained in a sac, which on the surface of the skin is lost in the epidermis. It ad- heres to this sac, probably by means of its nutrient ves- sels. The bodv of the hair consists of two substances.

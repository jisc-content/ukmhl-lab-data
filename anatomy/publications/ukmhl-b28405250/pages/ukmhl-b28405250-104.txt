9. I lie cerebellum : its weight about a seventh part of that of the cerebrum: its hemispheres:—its laminated struc- ture. On its upper surface, the superior vermiform process. On the lower surface, in the median line, the tuber annulare, where the crura cerebelli join the crura cerebri: laterally , the inferior vermiform process.—The cortical matter largely abounds m the cerebellum, and is intermixed with its white substance in such a way as to produce, in a vertical section, the appearance called arbor vita. 10. The spinal cord is that production of the brain, which passes through the foramen magnum, and, with its mem- branes, occupies the vertebral canal. 11. The membranes of the spinal cord. The dura mater lines the vertebral canal, but does not adhere to it very intimately. It affords small sheaths to each of the vertebral nerves as it passes out of the corresponding foramen. It subdivides at the lower part of the canal into numerous sheaths which accompany the sacral nerves. The dura mater of the canal is supposed to he covered on its internal surface by the reflected arachnoid. The pin mater sends a production which immediately covers the cord, and is more membranous and less vascular than the pia mater of the brain. It adheres to the cord by means of the minute subdivisions of its arteries, derived from the vertebral, the inferior thyroid, the intercostal and lumbar arteries. On its external surface it corresponds to the arachnoid membrane. The ligamentum denticulatum is a narrow membranous band whose nature is unknown. It adheres by its inner margin to the pia mater, throughout the whole length of the canal, and by serrated projections on its outer margin to the dura mater of the canal. The spaces between these projections are free.—The anterior and posterior surfaces of the mem- brane are unconnected with the neighbouring parts.

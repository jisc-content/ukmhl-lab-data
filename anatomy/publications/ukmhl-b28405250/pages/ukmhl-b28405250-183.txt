of the stomach :—more to the right it forms the left lamina of the ligamentum hepatis suspensorium, arrives at the convex- surface of the liver, forms its left lateral ligament, descends upon the anterior surface of its middle lobe, and advances as far as the anterior edge of the transverse fissure. It is then reflected in front of the hepatic and coronaria ventriculi arteries as far as the anterior surface of the stomach, thus forming the anterior lamina of the Omentum gastro-hepaticum. It then covers the whole anterior, or superior, surface of the stomach, passes in front of the arterise gastro-epiploica;: descends to the inferior regions of the abdomen, and then is reflected up- wards, as far as the convex edge of the arch of the colon- This lamina thus assists in forming the great Omentum, after which it covers the inferior surface of the arch of the colon, leaves that intestine, and passes below the duodenum and pancreas to become continuous with the mesentery, having thus formed the inferior lamina of the transverse Meso-colon. In the right hypochondrium the peritoneum passes from the diaphragm to the liver forming the right lamina of the ligamentum suspen- sorium, and the right lateral ligament, covers the convex surface, the edge, the inferior surface of the great lobe, the gall-bladder, and regains the diaphragm to pass into the peritoneum of the right lumbar region. From the gall-bladder, the peritoneum sends a prolongation which is engaged in a triangular open- ing situated below the neck of the gall-bladder, and in front of the abdominal vena cava. This opening is called the foramen of IVinslov:. The prolongation extends first, behind the biliary and hepatic vessels, as far as the lesser curvature of the stomach, forming the inferior lamina of the omentum gastro-hepaticum: covers the posterior, or inferior surface of the stomach, passes behind the arterise gastro-epiploic®, as far down as the inferior edge of the great omentum, thus lining the whole of its anterior lamina: it is then reflected up- wards, lining the posterior lamina of the omentum as far as the convex edge of the arch of the colon, covers the superior surface of that intestine, and thus forms the superior lamina oi the transverse Meso-colon. passes above the duodenum and

26 9. Externally the heart is covered by serous membrane.— Beneath it are collections of fat, which abounds particu- larly in the groove, separating the auricles and ventricles, and near the apex.— Below the fat is the muscular coat of the heart. The muscular fibre is peculiarly compact, cellular substance being scarcely visible.—The fibres arc formed in the ventricles into three principal strata : the external longitudinal, the middle transverse, the inter- nal oblique. The strata of the septum are, the inner stra- tum of each ventricle, and a middle transverse stratum. 10. The inner surface of the heart is lined by a delicate and smooth membrane, which from physiological con- siderations is supposed to differ in specie, in the right and left cavities. 11. The arteries of the heart are the two coronary arteries. The veins of the heart are collected into one venous trunk, the coronary vein. .Absorbent vessels have been demonstrated in great abundance—running between the serous and muscu- lar coat. The cardiac nerves are derived from the par vagurn, and the great intercostal or sympathetic nerve. 12. The pericardium is the sac which contains the heart, and the origin of the large vessels which spring from it.— Its inner surface is formed by the reflection of the serous membrane from the heart. On the outside of the serous coat is a fibrous production from the tendinous centre of the diaphragm which is insensibly lost on the large vessels.—The pericardium is connected to the pleura; by an abundant loose cellular substance which sometimes contains much fat. Vid. liichat. Anat. Descript. Vol. IV. p. 76. The pericardium is largely supplied with arteries fiom the aorta, the internal thoracic, and diaphragmatic arteries. —0—

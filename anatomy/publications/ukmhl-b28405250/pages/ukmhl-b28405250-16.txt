Its firmness—its great elastic city—its splendid pearly colour distinguish it from other animal substances. It resists putrefaction in a very great degree—it is nearly entirely dissolved by boiling in water—on desiccation it be- comes yellow, contracts, and loses its elasticity. On close inspection, it is found to be composed of fibres, which are interwoven in all directions, more or less closely connected by cellular substance in different parts of the body. No red vessels are found in cartilage in the healthy state —no nerves have been traced into its substance: nor have absorbents been demonstrated. Cartilage differs much in appearance according as it is found, 1. At the extremities of those bones which admit of motion, 2. On the articular sur- faces of immoveable bones, 3.

81 its folds, this ligament contains on its posterior concave edge the umbilical vein: arriving at the liver it divides into two portions, of which the inferior dips into the horizontal fissure, accompanying the umbilical vein, the superior mounts be- tween the concave surface of the diaphragm and convex sur- face of the liver, dividing that viscus into two unequal lobes. —In its descent from the umbilicus, the peritoneum covers the posterior part of the urachus and umbilical arteries, thus forming three folds called Ligamcnta Vesica- Suspensoria. —Proceeding from the umbilicus towards the lumbar regions, this portion of peritoneum passes in front of the kidneys, fixes the ascending and descending colon to the posterior parietes of the abdomen by folds called the ascending and descending Mesocolon, covers the aorta and vena cava, is reflected on the sides of the mesenteric vessels, and terminates r by suiTounding the sides and convex edge of the jejunum and ilion, thus forming the Mesentery. The hypogastric portion of the peritoneum covers the upper part of the anterior surface of the bladder, its fundus, the greater part of its posterior surface and sides. In the male, arriving at the base of the vesiculae seminales, it is reflected upon the rectum, which it covers in front and on the sides, and forms in front of the sacrum the Meso-rectum, continuous at its upper extremity with the descending meso-colon. On the sides of the bladder and rectum it covers the sacral and hypo- gastric vessels, and passes into the iliac regions. The epigastric portion of the peritoneum—on the left side, covers a great part of the abdominal surface of the diaphragm: at the origin of the splenic vessels it is reflected upon their posterior surface, covers the posterior edge, convex surface, and anterior edge of the spleen. Arriving at the fissure in that organ, it passes in front of the splenic vessels, and arrives at the cardiac extremity of the stomach and omentum gastro- hepaticum. The laminae of peritoneum between the spleen and stomach form the Omentum gastro-splenicum. From the central part of the diaphragm the peritoneum descends in front of the oesophageal aperture, as far as the anterior surface

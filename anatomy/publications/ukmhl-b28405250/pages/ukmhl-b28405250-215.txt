iOl tate, and on the inside of the crura of the cavernous body. Their excretory ducts open in the bulbous portion of the urethra. The arteries of the penis are principally from the internal pudic. Its absorbents open principally into the inguinal plexus, some into the hypo-gastric. Its nerves are from the pudic and lesser sciatic. The Organs of Generation of the Female. ]. The ovaries and Fallopian tubes. The ovaries are two in number : of an oval shape : a redish colour : situated in the posterior folds of the broad ligament of the uterus. By their outer edge they are attached to a portion of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes. By their inner edge they are attached to the uterus, by means of a vascular cord called the ligament of the ovary. The ovaries are surrounded by perito- neum, except on their inferior margin. Structure. Beneath the peritoneum is a dense cellular tissue forming the outer membrane of the ovary, which sends prolongations into its substance. Within it, is the parenchyme of the organ ; composed of cellular lobules with blood-vessels and nerves. In the cells are numerous vesicles consisting of a vascular membrane which contains a fluid. The arteries of the ovaries are the spermatic arteries : the nerves are from tire renal plexus ; the lymphatics open into the lumbar glands. The Fallopian tubes are situated within the folds of the broad ligaments of the uterus. They are about four inches in length : open by a small orifice into the uterus at its angles. The other extremity is wide and fimbriated : by one portion of the fringe alone, they are attached to the ovaries: the tube thus opening by a small orifice into the cavity of the peritoneum. Besides the partial peritoneal coveriug. the tubes consist of two membranes : of these

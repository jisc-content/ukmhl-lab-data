21 The Arteries. Arteries are hollow tubes, nearly cylindrical—Two large trunks* arise from the heart: by continual subdivision they are distributed to all parts of the body. There is great variety in the mode of the ramification ot arteries: but in all cases, the sum of the areas of the second- ary branches exceeds the area of the trunk from which they spring. They are remarkable for their elasticity both in the di- rection of their axes, and of their diameters. They are composed of three coats. The inner coat is a production of the membrane which lines the left cavity of the heart—it is very thin, transparent, white, and uniform in its texture, like serous membrane, without any fibrous appearance. It is easily ruptured. The middle is the proper coat of arteries: upon it their strength depends. It is dense and fibrous. The fibres run in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the artery, are disposed in layers, and may be dissected without diffi- culty from the inner coat. They are of a yellow colour, which is seen through the transparent inner tunic. The nature of the middle coat is peculiar. It is not muscular. It is abundantly supplied with blood vessels:—absorbents and nerves have not been demonstrated. The outer coat, which adheres closely to the middle, appears to consist of condensed cellular membrane. * These are, the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle, which delivers the blood to the lungs: and the aorta from the left ventricle, which transmits it to the rest of the body. In the lirst instance the blood conveyed is venom, until it arrives at the mi- nute vessels of the lungs—it then assumes the character of arterial blood, und is returned in this state to the heart. Hence the pul- monary artery does not belong to the arterial system.

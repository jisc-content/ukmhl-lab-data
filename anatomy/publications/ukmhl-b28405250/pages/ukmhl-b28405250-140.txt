64 membrane is distended : others are accidental. The former occur principally in the small intestines. There is a strong analogy between mucous membrane and skin. I he former has a corium and epidermis which are continuous with the corresponding components of skin. But the rete mucosum is wanting. Mucous membrane is however much more soft and pulpy than skin. It has also a much greater variety of consistency and thickness. The corium appears to have the general structure of true skin : blood vessels abound in it even more largely—particu- larly on its cuticular surface. Papilla and Villi, are largely disposed over the whole of this surface,—they are very different in magnitude in different regions : large and oblong in the tongue, stomach, and small intestines : smaller and Hatter in the large intestines, the gall bladder, and in excretory ducts. Mucous glands and follicles, are abundant throughout this texture, they are situated either below the corium or in its substance, and open on the interior of the cavity which is invested, by a duct.—Mucous glands are generally round and have no proper membrane, but are surrounded by cellular tissue. They are very vascular. Mucus is the Huid secreted by these glands.—It does not mix readily with water,—has a great affinity for oxygen, which it readily absorbs from the air, and becomes more thick and viscous during the process. It contains soda and mu- riate of soda, with phosphate of lime. It is probable that the secretion from the glands in different portions of this system differs in quality. The epidermis as it recedes from the skin of the external parts becomes gradually thinner and thinner, and is at length lost. It soon becomes of such tenuity in the human subject that it is difficult to ascertain its exact termination. It is probable that the portion which enters the mouth does not extend beyond the cardiac orifice of the stomach. Its absence is supplied by the adhesive mucous secretion.

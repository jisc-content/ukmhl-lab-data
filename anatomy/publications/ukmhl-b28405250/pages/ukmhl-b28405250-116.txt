52 vagi, the three cervical ganglia, and the recurrent nerves. The pulmonary plexus by filaments from the vagi, recurrent, and inferior cervical ganglia. The recurrent nerves are sent oft by the vagi, when in the thorax, to supply the larynx. Nervus accessorius ad par vagum. Origin from the spinal cord, about the third or fourth cervical verte- bra:—ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and posterior branches of the cervical nerves, receiv- ing filaments from the cord as it ascends.—It enters the cranium by the foramen magnum, gains the membranous canal of the par vagum, and passes out of the cranium with that nerve. It joins the fila- ments of the par vagum which are distributed to the larynx and pharynx, communicates with the cervical plexus, and supplies certain muscles of the neck and back. Nervus hypo-glossus, or lingualis. Origin by many filaments between the corpus olivare and pyramidale : is received in a sheath of the dura mater, and passes out of the anterior condyloid foramen. In the neck, having received filaments from the superior cervical ganglia, it forms two principal nerves, the cervicalis descendens, and the hi/po-glossus. The former assists some of the cervical nerves to form the middle cer- vical plexus :—the latter supplies all the muscles of the os hyoides, the genio-glossus, the sterno-thyroi- deus and the maxillary gland. Nervus sub-occipitalis. Origin from the spinal cord, by two branches which the ligamentum denticulatum separates, on the level of the occipital condyle. The small gangliform swelling between the vertebral artery and the atlas. The anterior branch commu- nicates with the hypo-glossus, vagus, and superior cervical ganglion. The posterior is distributed to the muscles on the back of the neck.

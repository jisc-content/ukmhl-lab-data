60 of the gland being soft and pulpy.—These have much cellu- lar tissue, yield readily and thus resist rupture. This is the structure of the prostate, tonsils, and all mucous glands. Vid. Bichat, Vol. II. 602. The parenchyme in some glands is included in cellular membrane alone ; in others in a peculiar membrane : others have a serous covering externally. Each acinus receives an ultimate branch of an artery. This communicates, in a manner unknown, with the capillary origins of the veins and of the excretory ducts. The nerves of glands are sometimes derived exclusively from the cerebral nerveS—as in the lachrymal and salivary glands, and the amygdalae; or equally from the cerebral nerves and those of the ganglia, as in the testicle, liver, &c.; or exclusively from the ganglia as in the kidney and most of the mucous glands. The ducts are tubes having an internal mucous coat, which is a production from the mucous membrane of the surface on which they open, and an external covering which differs in different glands. They are abundantly provided with vessels and nerves. —0— The Organs ok Sense. 1. The Skin is the organ of touch. It forms moreover the general covering of the body,—and an excretory organ of great importance. 2. The skin consists of three substances \ the corium or true skin is internal :—externally is the epidermis: be- tween the two is the rete mucosum. 3. The Corium, is remarkable externally for the small de- pressions or furrows which it presents. These differ in magnitude in different parts of the body : they are largest in the palms of the hands and joints of the fingers.

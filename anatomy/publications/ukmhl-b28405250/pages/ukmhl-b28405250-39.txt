Med. Observ. and Enquiries, Vol. II. p. 29. 13 The Cellular System. Cellular membrane is somewhat grey in colour—highly extensible aud contractile—presenting cellsWhich are formed of delicate transparent laminae. These cells are very varia- ble in shape and magnitude. Proofs that the cells commu- nicate. Of the extensive distribution of this membrane through- out the whole body—Of the mode in which it enters into the formation of almost every organ. It resists putrefaction and the effects of maceration in a degree superior to most other textures. On boiling in water it dissolves and forms gelatine. The common systems which enter into the composition of cellular membrane are bloodvessels, exhalants, absorb- ents and nerves. The fluids which the cellular membrane contains are serum and fat. The serous fluid generally abounds most in those situa- tions where there is no fat, as the scrotum, eyelids, &c.— though this remark does not apply to the cellular substance which surrounds mucous membranes, arteries and veius, &c. The fat is differently disposed in different parts of this system—abounding in some, and being totally deficient in others. Its disposition, consistence and colour also vary at different periods of life. The serous fluid and fat are not lodged in the same or even similar cavities of this membrane, for the saccuii which contain the fat do not communicate. Hence this system is divided by l)r. \\ . Hunter into two portions: that which contains serous fluid being called the reticular, and that which contains fat, the adipose cellular membrane. V ide

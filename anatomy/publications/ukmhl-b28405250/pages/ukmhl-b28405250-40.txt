14 The M uscular System. The fibre of muscle is of a peculiar nature. It varies in diameter, as seen by the naked eye, from the twentieth to the hundredth part of an inch. When viewed by a micro- scope this fibre is seen to consist of others placed parallel to each other which are still smaller. From Prochaskaâ€™s experiments it appears that the fibrous part of any muscle may be resolved into ultimate fibres of the same form and appearance, whose diameter does not exceed the forty-thousandth part of an inch. These are very variable in length : and are supposed to extend in some parts to nearly three feet - they preserve the same diameter throughout: are solid and not perfectly cylindrical. These primary fibres placed parallel to each other, form fasciculi whose tranverse section is never circular. The fas- ciculi are again united by cellular membrane, which is pro- bably also the connecting medium of the smaller fibres. Vid. Gordon's Anat. I. 226. Blood vessels, exhalants, absorbents and nerves enter largely into the composition of muscle: they may be traced between the fasciculi accompanying the sheaths of cellular membrane. The colour of muscle depends upon the blood which circulates in its vessels. By maceration in water, the colour is removed: the water is found to contain the colouring matter, a peculiar extractive substance, albumen with a little phosph. of soda ammonia and lime, and carbonate of lime. The greyish fibrous part which remains undissolved, presents all the characters of the fibrine of the blood.

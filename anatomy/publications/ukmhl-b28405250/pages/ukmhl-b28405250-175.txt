81 and in the trachea it presents longitudinal plica*, and nume- rous orifices of excretory ducts belonging to the mucous glands which are situated in the cellular tissue exterior to the fibrous membrane. The epidermis of the mucous membrane of the air-tubes has not been demonstrated. The arteries of the trachea are from the thyroid, especially the inferior. The bronchial arteries are immediately from the aorta, and follow the subdivisions of the tubes. The nerves are supplied principally from the par vagum assisted by filaments from the pulmonary plexus. 6- The pulmonary artery. Its inner membrane similar to that of veins. Its fibrous membrane similar to that of the aorta. The subdivisions of the pulmonary artery accompany those of the bronchi. The two orders of vessels have no direct communication, but are united by cellular tissue alone. 7- The pulmonary veins. Their inner membrane possesses the properties of the corresponding membrane of arteries. The outer resembles the corresponding membranes of veins. The pulmonary veins have their origins in the capillary system of the lungs. The branches continually coalesce, and at length enter the left auricle of the heart by four principal trunks. It is in the capillary system of the lungs that the ultimate branches of the pulmonary artery and veins are intimately connected with those of the air-tubes. It is doubtful however whether there be free communication amongst them. Vid. Haller, Vol. III. p. 158â€”16'5. 8. The substance of the lungs, compounded of these subdivisions of different orders of vessels, is divisible into lobes. The lobes are composed of lobules united by cellular substance, and these again of others still smaller and smaller. The ultimate lobuli are considered to be distinct membranous cavities, or vesicles, on the surface of which the different orders of vessels commu- nicate bv means of their minute and numerous capillaries.

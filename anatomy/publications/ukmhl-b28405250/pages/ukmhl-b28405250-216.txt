102 the external is cellular, spongy, and highly vascular: the internal, continuous with the mucous membrane of the ute- rus, extends somewhat beyond the external, and essentially constitutes the corpus Jimbriatum. 2. The uterus : n its shape : its situation in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum. Above, it is covered by the convolutions of the small intestines; below, it is continuous with the vagina. Its upper and broadest portion is called the fundus: the body gradu- ally narrows into the neck. The lower portion of the neck projects into the vagina: the cavity of the uterus communicating with that of the vagina by the os tinccc. The cavity of the uterus : the superior angles : the open- ings of the Fallopian tubes. The ligaments of the uterus, vid. page 86. Structure. The serous covering adheres intimately to the superior edge of the uterus : more loosely, elsewhere. Be- neath it, particularly on the surfaces, is a dense cellular tissue, free from fat, by which it is separated from the proper substance of the uterus. It is upon this proper tissue that the thickness of the uterus depends: its texture is compact and resisting : of a greyish colour: traversed by numerous small vessels: it is most dense near the neck of the uterus: its nature is unknown, it resembles no other structure in the body. It adheres closely to the internal mucous membrane. The mucous membrane of the uterus is very thin: villi are scarcely apparent: the orifices of the mucous crypt® are most numerous near the neck : with a microscope the open orifices also of an infinite number of pores, or vessels, may be observed. » The uterine arteries are numerous: they are from the spermatic, and the uterine divisions of the hypo-gastric ar- teries. They have a very tortuous distribution in the midst of the cellular membrane which is beneath the serous coat. The veins are even more tortuous : the plexus pampiniformis of Haller. The nerves of the uterus are from the hypo-

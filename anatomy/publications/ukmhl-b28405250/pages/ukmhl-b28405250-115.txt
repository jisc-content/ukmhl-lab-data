51 h. Menus auditorius—origin from the sides of the fourth ventricle and tuber annulare, the filaments forming a fasciculus which embraces the facial nerve: the two thus proceed to the meatus auditorius interims. The auditory nerve, then separating itself from the facial, is divided into three branches to be distributed to the cochlea, the vestibule, and the semicircular canals of the ear. i. Men us glosso-pharyngeus. Origin from the spinal cord behind the corpus olivare—between the facial nerve and the par vagum. It enters a peculiar sheath formed by the dura mater, emerges from the cranium by the foramen lacerum posterius, passes over the internal carotid, and is distributed to the tongue near the insertion of the hvo-glossus muscle. It also sends filaments to the constrictors of the pha- rynx. In its passage it communicates w ith the supe- rior cervical ganglion, and par vagum. k. Menus Vagus. Origin immediately below the glosso- pharyngeal nerve by filaments which are formed into fasciculi: passes in its peculiar canal formed by the dura mater,—emerges by the foramen lacerum poste- rius, being situated between the glosso-pharyngeal and the jugular vein. In the neck it lies on the outside of, and behind, the carotid artery—passes over the subclavian artery on the right side, and the arch of the aorta on the left, behind the bronchi, to gain the oesophagus, along the sides of which the two nerves pass. Penetrating the oesophageal aper- ture of the diaphragm they are distributed to the stomach. In the neck it communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and supplies the larvnx :—forms with filaments from the superior cervical ganglion the pharyngeal plexus. The cardiac ph i us is formed by filaments from the n -2

The further division, ordi- narily, of the superior portion of the right lung into two. So that the left lung consists of two lobes, the right usually of three. 4. The substance of the lungs consists of the subdivisions of the air-tubes, of the subdivisions of the pulmonary artery , and of the pulmonary veins, of the proper tissue which serves as a medium of communication between these different orders of vessels, together with nutrient vessels, absorbents, and nervesâ€”and an investing serous membrane. The Air-Tubes. The Trachea, continuous with the Larynx, divides about the second or third dorsal vertebra into the two Bronchi, one for each lung. The subdivi- sions of the bronchi. Structure. The Trachea consists externally of a mem- brane composed of longitudinal fibres, which is continuous throughout the whole length of the trachea behind. This membrane on its fore-part is continually' interrupted by trans- verse cartilages, representing two-thirds of the circumference of a circle, into whose margins and outer surfaces it is in- serted. It gradually becomes thinner in the subdivisions of tbe bronchi. The cartilages are variable in number in the trachea : the first, which is the largest adheres to the cricoid : the last has a peculiar shape suited to the reception of the superior cartilage of the bronchus on each side. In the bronchi the cartilages insensibly become irregular, and are at length lost. 1 he extreme branches of each cartilage are connected behind by transverse fibrous bands, which many anatomists consider to lie muscular. Vid. Haller. Vol. III. p. 146- The inner surface of the air-tubes is lined with mucous membrane continued from that of the larynx. It invests the most minute subdivisions of these tubes. Its colour is pale.

103 gastnc plexus ; near the vagina they are assisted by fila- ments from the sacral nerves. The lymphatics are very numerous: they join the hypo-gastric, the lumbar, the external iliac plexus. 3. The vagina is u membranous canal extending from the neck of the uterus to the vulva. Its situation, between the rectum and bladder. Structure. It has a slight peritoneal covering at its upper portion: by its lower it is connected to the bladder and rectum, a loose cellular tissue intervening. The cellular tissue becomes more dense near the vulva. Beneath the cellular membrane is a thin tissue peculiar to the vagina, continued, at its upper portion into the proper substance of the uterus : at the lower orifice of the vagina devolving into a spongy structure, the plexus retiformis.—The internal mucous membrane is continuous with that of the vulva, and of the vagina: it is thinnest near the neck of the uterus : abounds in mucous follicles ; presents numerous plic*. The arteries form a net-work round the vagina, they are from the uterine, the haemorrhoidales media', pudica» interna, the vesicales. The absorbents communicate with the inter- nal iliac plexus. The nerves are from the hypo-gastric plexus, and sacral nerves. 4. The vulva comprises all the more external organs of generation in the female. These are the pubis, labia externa, labia interna (or nymphas), clitoris, orifice of the urethra, orifice of the vagina, the hymen. 6. The mamma;: their situation upon the pectoral muscles. The areola: its subcutaneous glands. The nipple: the opening of the lactiferous tubes. Structure. The glandular part of the mamma is small in comparison of the whole bulk of the organ. It consists of small lobes which are connected by cellular membrane. The lobes are more closely connected near the centre of the

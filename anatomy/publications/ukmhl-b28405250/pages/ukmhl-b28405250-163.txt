75 3. The meatus auditorius externusâ€”extends from the con- vexity of the concha to the membrana tympani. Its lengtli in the adult is about an inch, its diameter a quarter of an inch: its direction arched. Structure. The osseus meatus of the temporal bone is assisted at its lower part by a triangular lamina of tibro-car- tilage produced from the pinna, at its upper and lateral parts by fibrous membrane which connects the sides of this lamina. The inner membrane is a production from the skin of th6 ear. It is continued over the outer surface of the tympanum. In the cellular substance beneath the inner membrane are the ceruminous glands. The properties of cerumen. By chemical analysis it consists of albumen, an inspissated oil, a colouring matter, soda and phosphate of lime. 4. The membrana tympani. Its direction oblique down- wards and inwards. It is composed of three membranes : the proper membrana tympani being invested externally by the lining of the meatus, internally by that of the tympanum. 5. The cavity of the tympanum. Its situation at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where it is joined by the two other portions. Its general cavity is hemispherical. It is lined with mucous membrane continuous with that of the mouth through the Eustachian tube, its only opening externally. At the bottom of the tympanum the promontory is the eminence which separates the fenestra ovalis from the fenestra rotunda. The fenestra ovalis, covered by the base of the stapes is above it: below and behind it is the fenestra rotunda which is closed by mucous membrane. The pyramid is an eminence behind the fenestra ovalis, hollowed for the reception of the stapedius muscle. Behind, and near the membrana tympani, is the opening by which the chorda tympani penetrates from the aqueduct of Fallopius. A little higher than the fenestra rotunda, and behind it, is the opening of the mastoid cells.

65 The Organ of Taste. I. The Tongue is the principal organ of taste. Many parts situated in the same cavity, the mouth, are accessory to the due performance of its function. o. The boundaries of the mouth are, the lips and cheeks, in front and on the sides—the palate above, the velum palati and its pillars behind, and the tongue below. 3. The lips and cheeks consist of skin, muscular strata, and internal mucous membrane, with cellular membrane and fat which varies much in quantity. The soft palate and velum pendulum palati are a pro- duction from the posterior edge of the palate bones, formed of a double layer of mucous membrane, continu- ous from the palatine and nasal surfaces of those bones, with intervening muscles. On the middle of the edge where the two layers unite is an elongated portion called the uvula. The muscular stratum of the palate consists of the azygos uvulae in the middle, and the levatores palati on . the sides.—The anterior pillar is formed by the constric- tor isthmifaucium, the posterior by the palato-pharyngeus. Between the pillars are the mucous glands called amygdalae. 4. The mucous membrane which lines the cheeks, and base of the tongue, is perforated by the ducts of the salivary glands. These are the two parotids, the two submax- illary, the two sublingual glands. The Parotid Gland, occupies the space between the meatus auditorius externus, mastoid process, condyle and angle of the lower jaw, extends upon the masseter mus- cle, and in that situation has two projecting cornua. Its lobes are large, the connecting cellular tissue dense : the external coat condensed cellular membrane. The ducts form a single excretory tube which passes across the Fl

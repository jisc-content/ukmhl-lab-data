Veins are tubes which have their origin in the capillary system, in a mode which is not well ascertained. The smaller veins coalesce to form trunks whose area is always less than the sum of their areas. They run in two different modes, being either superficial, that is, situated under the integuments, or deep-seated, that is, accompanying the arteries. The capacity of the venous system is considerably greater than that of the arterial. In shape they are nearly cylindrical, but, not possessing an elasticity equal to that of the arteries, they collapse w'hen empty. Veins consist of three coats. The inner coat is a prolongation of the delicate mem- brane w'hich lines the cavities of the right side of the heart— it extends from the capillary system throughout the veins and right side of the heart, to the termination of the ultimate branches of the pulmonary vein. It forms by its duplicatures the valves of the veins, whose shape is parabolic, the free edge being nearest to the heart. Valves are not found in all veins, they abound most in the superficial. They are gene- rally disposed in pairs; sometimes three are found together, sometimes there is only one. The middle coat is that w'hich is peculiar to this system. It is disposed in longitudinal fibres. This coat is of much tenuity, so as to be scarcely visible in many of the veins—

IV In some instances of complexity or of difficulty, the result of his labours may be recorded for the means of a more ready recollection. In others, when, from the limited nature of a course of lectures, facts only can be stated, whilst the detail of laborious experiment by which they have been attained, is but distantly alluded to, full reference should be given to the best original authors, for the assistance of those who wish to institute a more complete enquiry. These different objects are aimed at in the following work. There is a difficulty in the commencement of all sci- ences, the mathematical excepted, which it seems impossible to remove. Let description begin where it will, it will still be found that some information is anticipated:—that some- thing is always supposed known, which it is one object of the undertaking to teach. To elude this difficulty in Ana- tomy, it appears advisable, previous to the formal demon- stration of the parts, to enter upon some general views of the structure and functions of animals. The less perfect orders of animals which execute organic functions alone, present an obvious mode of ascertaining the instruments of such functions, and the phenomena which attend their per- formance. By ascending in the scale of creation these are observed to be combined with others more elaborate:— with the power of voluntary motion, and of speech—with the exercise of the organs of sense, and of the intellectual faculties. The introductory Lecture will comprise such a review ; it will afford a general notion of the objects of the Course. Thus the ear will be familiarised to the language of the science, and the imagination interested in its pursuit. Trin. Coll. Jan. 9, 1822.

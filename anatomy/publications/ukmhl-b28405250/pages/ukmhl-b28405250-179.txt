SS Arteries at the upper part from the inferior Thyroid, and (Esophageal: near the Stomach, from the Diaphragmatic and Coronaria Ventriculi. Nerves: from the Vagi, Pulmonary and Cardiac Plexus, and Thoracic Ganglia, forming a plexus throughout its extent. The Stomach and intestinal Canal, with their append- ages, are contained in the cavity of the abdomen. 4. Cavity of the Abdomen. Formation of its parietes. Its arbitrary divisions into regions. In the middle, the Epi- gastric, Umbilical, and Hypogastric regions :â€”on each side, the Hypochondriac, Lumbar, and Iliac regions. The Peritoneum invests the interior of the abdominal parietes, and is reflected over all the viscera which they contain. It is a serous membrane, whose thickness is very variable in its different portions. Its free surface is perfectly smooth and lubricous : its adhering surface flocculent, and connected by cellular membrane. It presents a sac without any opening in the male. In the female the uterus communicates with the cavity of the abdomen by means of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes. Peritoneal folds. Supposing the peritoneum to consist of three portions, an umbilical, or middle portion, representing a circular band placed horizontally between the base of the chest and the crests of the ilia: an epigastric, or superior portion, a hypogastric, or inferior portion, each representing a segment of a spheroid continuous by the circumference ofits base, the one with the superior edge of the middle portion, tlie other with the inferior edge of the same: the course of the peritoneum may be traced as follows. The umbilical portion covers the posterior part of the linea alba, and the aponeurotic expansions behind the recti muscles. Passing from the umbilicus towards the inferior edge of the liver, and ensiform cartilage, it forms a triangular duplicature called Ligamentum latum Hepatis Suspensorium. Between F 0

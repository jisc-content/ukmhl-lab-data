31 it is thicker in the superficial than in the deep-seated veins, and in the branches than the larger trunks. Its nature is unknown. It differs essentially from the fibrous coat of arteries, and from muscular fibre. It is not found in the sinuses of the brain. The outer coat is formed of a condensed cellular tissue, apparently similar to the corresponding coat of arteries. Veins are well supplied with blood-vessels. Bichat. Anat. Gen. I. 363. All the veins, with the exception of those of the heart, are at length collected into two principal truuks, the ascend- ing and descending cava:; which, with the coronary vein, terminate in the right auricle of the heart. —0— Course of the Veins. 1. The deep-seated veins in general accompany the arteries, and have similar appellations. 2. The superficial veins of the upper extremity are a. Vena cephalica. b. Basilica. c. Mediana. 1. Mediana cephalica. 2. Mediana basilica. The basilic and cephalic veins join the axillary vein. 3. The veins of the integuments and muscles of the head, and of the face, form two great trunks, which unite at the angle of the jaws to form the jugutaris externa,— these are a. Facialis anterior. b. Facialis posterior. 4. The veins of the brain and of its membranes do not accompany the arteries, but arc received into the sinuses

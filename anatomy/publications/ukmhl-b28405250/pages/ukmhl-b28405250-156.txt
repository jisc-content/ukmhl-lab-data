72 of blood vessels and of the ciliary nerves—without any muscu- lar fibre. Its posterior surface has been called urea, and seems to be a production from the ciliary circle, and in brutes, of the nature of the choroid. In man, the iris and uvea form one membrane. J he colour of the iris is due to its vessels and to the pigmen- tum nigrum which smears it behind. Pupil. The lesser circumference, or opening of the iris, is called the pupil. 3. The Retina. The optic nerve, arriving at the bulb of the eye, quits its fibrous covering and divides into about thirty fila- ments which unfold in every direction to form the retina. The retina lines the inner surface of the choroid to within a sixth part of an inch of the ciliary processes. The central artery and vein of the retina, entering the centre of the optic nerve, send some small vessels to the retina and then pierce the vitreous body. In the centre of the retina about the fifth of an inch on the outside of the entrance of the optic nerve is the foramen cen- trale surrounded by the limbus luteus. Neither are observ- able in subjects under two years old. The humours of the eye. 1. The vitreous humour, convex at its posterior part, and a little concave in front, colourless and entirely transparent, occupies the greater portion of the globe—extending from the retina to the crystalline lens. It consists of a delicate membrane called the hyaloid membrane, which adheres to the retina by means of the central artery which pierces it behind ; and in front to the capsule of the lens and the ciliary processes. This mem- brane containing the humour divides in front into two lamina?; of which one, called the ciliary zone, adheres to the fore part of the capsule of the lens and the ciliary processes : the other adheres to the posterior part of this capsule. Where the two divide a circular space is left surrounding the capsule, called the canal of Petit. The hyaloid also penetrates the substance of the vitreous

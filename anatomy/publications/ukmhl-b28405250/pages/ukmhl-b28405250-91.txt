10. I'cna Porta. The splenic rein reteivts the blood of the vasa brevia, v. gastro-epiploica dextra et sinistra— corouaria ventriculi—duodenalis. The mesenterica infe- rior corresponds to the artery of the same name. The mesenterica superior is formed of all the other intestinal veins. These three brandies unite to form the vena porta4, which after receiving in its course the veins of the pyloric extremity of the stomach and of the duodenum, penetrates the liver, and delivers its contents in all directions to that viscus. The Absorbent System. 1. The Absorbent System is composed of two parts— vessels and glands. 2. Absorbent vessels may be demonstrated in most parts of the body—and are supposed to exist in all. Their origins cannot be discovered even with a microscope. They run in two distinct classes; a superficial and deep seated. The middle sized absorbents differ in their distribution from arteries and veins. 1. When two of them are united together, the trunk is seldom or never larger than either of them separately. 2. Their anastomoses are continual. 3. They seldom run any great distance without dividing Into branches, and again reuniting into trunks. Gordons Anal. The valves of the absorbents are very numerous, they are generally found in pairs, never three together. There is no constancy in their distribution in different subjects, except that valves are generally found where a branch unites with a trunk. The structure of these vessels is determinable only in the larger trunks—thev seem to consist of one coat

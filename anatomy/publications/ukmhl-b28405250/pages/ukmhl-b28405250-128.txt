58 I heir external branches communicate with the anterior branches of the dorsal nerves. The internal supply the parts in their neighbourhood and give rise to the splanchnic nerves, which are the origin of all the abdominal plexus. 4. Great splanchnic Neri'e. Formed by four or five branches from the sixth or seventh to the ninth or tenth ganglion. Passes the crura of the diaphragm between their branches, forms with the nerve of the opposite side, and assisted by nerves from the dorsal ganglia, the great solar plexus, which is situated upon the aorta in front of the vertebral column and behind the stomach. o. The solar Plexus distributes its subdivisions to the aorta. By its branches, in this way, are formed, the diaphrag- matic plexus, the cccliac, the superior and inferior mesen- teric, the renal plexus. 6. The lesser splanchnic Nerve—origin by two branches from the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia. Joins the nerve of the opposite side about the level of the twelfth rib—penetrates into the abdomen, and divides into two branches : one joins the great splanchnic nerve, the other the renal plexus. 7. The abdominal ganglia, are situated on the sides of the vertebrae between the twelfth rib and the sacrum. By superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, with the last thoracic and first sacral ganglion. Externally, with the anterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Internally, they assist in forming all the plexus in their neighbourhood. 8. The sacral ganglia are variable in number—generally three. By their superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, and with the last abdominal ganglion.

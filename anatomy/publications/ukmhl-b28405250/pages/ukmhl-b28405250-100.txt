44 all its convolutions—and penetrates its ventricles under the names of telachordidea and plexus chord ides. It con- sists of a multitude of blood-vessels derived from the two vertebral, the basilar, and internal carotid arteries, which are connected by delicate cellular membrane, according to Bichat. The veins of the pia mater open into the sinuses of the dura mater. 5. The arachnoid does not penetrate the anfractuosities of the brain, but passes from one convolution to another : it penetrates, and, according to Bichat, invests the ventri- cles of the brain : supplies sheaths to the vessels and nerves, and as they leave the cranium is reflected from them over the dura mater. It thus presents a sac with- out any opening, and is classed amongst the serous membranes. JN either blood-vessels, absorbents, nor nerves have been demonstrated in it. 6. The brain is divided into two parts, the cerebrum and cerebellum, both of which are symmetrical. 7. The cerebrum—its weight is from thirty-five to forty-five ounces avoirdupois. The two hemispheres divided by the longitudinal Jissure. The convolutions and fossa : their colour. On the upper surface of the cerebrum, are remarked the corpus callosum, its longitudinal ridges, its raphe. On the inferior surface, in the median line, from before backwards, the continuation of the longitudinal fissure—commissure of the optic nerves—pituitary gland and infundibulum—corpora albicantia. On each side of the median line—the fossa in the anterior lobe for the olfactory nerves,—the jissura Sylvii dividing the anterior and middle lobes, — the tractus optici, — the crura cerebri which connect the cerebrum and cerebellum,— the excavation which marks the boundary of the middle and posterior lobes, — the Jissure which, when the membranes are removed, communicates with the lateral ventricles.

104 gland; near its circumference, they form irregular appendices. The gland is situated in the midst of much fat, nearer to the integuments than to the pectoral muscles. The fat is en- closed in cells much larger than those of common adipose cellular membrane.â€”The lactiferous tubes arise from the lobes of the gland, and from the surrounding adipose sub- stance. These at length form from fifteen to twenty ducts which pierce the spongy tissue of the nipple, and open upon its outer surface. The arteries of the mamma are from the internal thoracic, the external thoracic and axillary arteries. The absorbents terminate principally in the axillary plexus : some, at the same time, penetrate the thorax, and open into the thoracic duct, or subclavian vein. The nerves are from the sympa- thetic, the third and fourth cervical nerves. End of Part I.

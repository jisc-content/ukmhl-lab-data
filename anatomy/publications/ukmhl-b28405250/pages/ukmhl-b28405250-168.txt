78 f). The vessels and nerves of the ear. Arteries. The meatus externus derives its arteries from the pos- terior auricular, and temporal. The cavity and small bones of the tympanum from the posterior auricular, internal maxil- lary, and meningeal. The labyrinth from the basilar artery. Nerves. The auditory nerve entering the meatus internus, pene- trates in two portions the vestibule and the cochlea. The facial nerve, in its passage through the aqueduct of Fal- lopius, having received a filament from the Vidian nerve, sends to the membrana tympani the nerve called chorda tympani, and filaments to the muscles of the small bones. —0— t The Organ of the Voice. 1. The larynx essentially constitutes the organ of the voice. It consists of cartilages, membranes, ligaments, and muscles. It is connected to the os hyoides, and commu- nicates with the cavity of the fauces above ; below it is • continuous with the trachea. 2. The cartilages of the larynx are four in number: the thyroid, the cricoid, the two arytenoid cartilages. Their relative situations and connections described. The fibro- cartilage of the larynx, the epiglottis : its connection with the tongue, the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage. 3. These several parts arc connected by ligaments and muscles : and are lined on their inner surface, by a thick and soft mucous membrane amply provided with glands, which is continued from that of the fauces. 4. The Glottis, or Rima Glottidis, described : the superior and inferior ligaments of the glottis, or thyro-arytenoid. Between each pair of ligaments, on the sides, are the ventricles of the larynx. Muscles of the larynx and os hyoides. Vide page 16. 5.

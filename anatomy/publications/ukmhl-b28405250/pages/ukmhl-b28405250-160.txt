I he ophthalmic artery supplies the eye. The optic nerve is subservient to vision. The motores oculorum, pathetici and abducentes supply the muscles.—The orbital branch of the ophthalmic nerve supplies the lacrymal gland, and sends filaments to assist the other nerves. The ciliary nerves are derived from the ophthalmic ganglion. The Organ of Hearing. 1. The ear consists of three distinct divisions, 1. The ex- ternal ear, or pinna, with the meatus auditorius externus. 2. The cavity of the tympanum, with the mastoid cells and Eustachian tube. 3. The internal ear, or labyrinth. 0. The external ear. Its projections are, from above down- wards; the helix : the antihelix (between the two supe- rior portions of which is the fossa navicularis): the tragus which projects over the meatus from before : the anti- tragus. In the midst of these eminences is the concha which terminates in the meatus. Below it is the lobule of the ear. #» Structure. The skin abounds in sebaceous follicles both in front of, and behind, the pinna. It presents hairs only on the internal surface of the tragus. The lobule is composed entirely of skin and compact adipose membrane. Fibro-cartilage, nearly of the shape of the ear is below the skin.—Its interrupted portions are connected by ligaments. Small muscles, inconstant in their appearance, effect slight alterations of shape in the pinna. These are, 1. Tragicus. 2. Antitragicus. 3. Helicis major. 4. Helicis minor. 5. Transversalis. The pinna is fixed to the head by three ligaments inserted into the convex surface of the concha. The arteries are from the external carotid. The nerves are from the facial, the inferior maxillary, the third cervical.

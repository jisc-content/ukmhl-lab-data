The nerves are from the par vagum, viz. the external and internal laryngeal with filaments from the glosso-pharyn- geal, and the recurrent with filaments, from the cardiac plexus. —0— 8. Description of the thyroid gland. —0— The Organs of Respiration. 1. The lungs, the respiratory organs, are contained in the cavity of the thorax. 2. Description of the cavity of the thorax in the recent subject. The mode in which the serous membrane (Pleura Costalis) invests the inner surface of the thorax —is reflected upon the surface of each lung (Pleura Pulmonalis), and in its course constitutes two principal cavities, one for each lung, which do not communicate. Spaces arc left between these circumscribed cavities at their anterior and posterior parts. The anterior space extends in an oblique direction from right to left beneath the sternum, and is called the anterior Mediastinum. The posterior is parallel to the vertebral column, and is called the posterior Mediastinum. The anterior Mediastinum contains—in its upper portion, the subclavian Veins and Vena Cava Superior, the arch of the aorta and trunks which spring from it, the remains of the Thymus gland and some absorbent glands: in its lower por- tion, the Pericardium and Heart. The posterior Mediastinum contains, the. pulmonary7 ves- sels, the end of the trachea, and commencement of the bronchi, the greatest part of the (Esophagus, the descending Aorta, Par Vagum, Vena Azygos, Thoracic duct, many absorbent glands.

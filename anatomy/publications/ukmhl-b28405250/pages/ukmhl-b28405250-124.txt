56 The nerves which proceed from a ganglion are of two kinds: branches which communicate with the cerebral nerves and ganglia above and below it: and others which are curiously interwoven with branches from neighbouring gan- glia forming a network of nervous filaments, with gangliform swellings, called plexus. The first set is whitish, and resembles the cerebral nerves, the other is greyish or redish. The nerves of the plexus always surround the arteries, and are distributed along with them and their subdivisions to the organs for which they are destined. Nerves of the Ganglia. 1. The Ophthalmic Ganglia is, according to Bich&f, the only true ganglion which belongs to the head. It is situated at the bottom of the orbit, on the inside of the optic nerve. It sends branches to the nose—to the motor oculorum, and sends otf the celiary nerves. 2. The Cervical Ganglia are usually three in number. The first has an oblong form,—it is deep seated about the third or fourth vertebra of the neck. Its size is varia- ble. The middle cervical ganglion, round or lenticular, is generally found between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. The inferior cervical ganglion is very irregu- lar in form : it is situated above the neck of the first rib. a. The superior cervical ganglion—sends branches upwards to the carotid canal to join the motor oculorum, and Vidian branch of the superior maxillary. Internally, it gives off branches to join the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and to be distributed to the larynx, communicating with others from the laryngeal and recurrent nerves. Externally, branches to communicate with the anterior branches of the cervical nerves.

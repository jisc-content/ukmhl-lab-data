45 The anterior lobe rests upon the orbitar plate of the frontal bone, the middle in the temporal fossa, the posterior upon the tentorium cerebelli. 8. In cutting the hemispheres of the brain horizontally they are observed to be composed of different coloured matters : that which is brownish being for the most part exterior, is called the cortical substance,—that which is white, is called the medullary substance. The nature of both is unknown. The centrum ovale. The dimensions and direction of the lateral ventricles in the three lobes of the brain. The septum lucidum, and cavity formed by the separation of its lamina;. The fornix—its anterior and posterior crura,—of which the former may be traced to the corpora albicantia, the latter diverge from each other and pass into the inferior horn of the ventricles, adhering by one margin to an eminence called the hippocampus or cornu Ammonis, whilst the other margin, being loose, is called corpus fimbriatum or tenia hippocampi. The hippocampus or cornu Ammonis—its bulbous projection called pes hippocampi: the digital cavity. The h/ra, an appearance on the inferior surface of the fornix. The corpora striata. The optic tholami. Tania semi-circu- laris. The foramen commune anterius, by which the two lateral ventricles communicate with each other, and with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus—tela cho- roidea, and vena magna Galcni. The anterior commis- sure of the brain. The foramen commune posterius,— the posterior commissure. The pineal gland,—its pedun- culi—its concretions, or acervuli, composed of phosphate of lime. Tubercula (jitadrigemiua. Valvulu Vieussenii, which covers the fourth ventricle. In the third ventricle are, the iter ad infitndulum (a substance which extends to the pituitary gland), and, below the posterior com- missure, the iter a tertio ad i/uartum ventriculum. In the fourth ventricle is the groove called calamus scrip- torins.

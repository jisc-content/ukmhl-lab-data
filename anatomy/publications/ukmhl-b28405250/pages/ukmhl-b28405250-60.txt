24 surface is flocculent, and adheres to the parts which it invests by means of cellular substance. This membrane presents great varieties of consistence in different parts of the body. It is thick on the liver, omen- tum, &c. when compared with the delicate arachnoid mem- brane of the brain. It is not very extensible, nor very con- tractile. By maceration it presents a cellular structure, and is at length reduced to a pulp. No peculiar matter or proper fibre enters into the composition of serous membrane, so that it is considered by Bichat as nearly approaching the nature of cellular membrane. Anatomie generate, Vol. II. 556. It is largely supplied with exhalants and absorbents. Nerves have not been traced into its substance. * —0— The Circulating System. 1. The circulating system consists of the heart, the arteries, and the veins. 2. The Heart is a hollow^ muscular organ, representing in figure a three-sided pyramid. It is covered externally and lined internally by a membrane. It presents a base, an anterior and posterior surface, an apex, an anterior and posterior margin. The anterior surface is also superior and convex, the posterior is turned downw ards and is flat. 3. It is divided by a septum into tw'o portions which do not communicate. Each of these portions consist of an auricle and a ventricle which cofnmunicate freely. 4. The auricles occupy the base of the heart—one being anterior when the heart is in its natural position, the other posterior—the ventricles are between the auricles and the apex of the heart, the one anterior the other posterior. The anterior auricle and ventricle, from a reference to the position of the corresponding cavities

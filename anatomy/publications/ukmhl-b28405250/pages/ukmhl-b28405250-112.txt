50 the alveolar nerve, or posterior dentium,—passes through the infra-orbitar canal, gives off the anterior dentium, and emerging is called the infra-orbital nerve, and is distri- buted to the muscles and integuments of the face. 3. Inferior Maxillary Nerve—passes from the cranium by the foramen ovale.—Divides into two principal portions, of •which the external sends branches to the temporal, masseter, and pterygoid muscles, and the internal supplies the proper inferior maxillary, lingual and auricular nerves. The lin- gual nerve may be traced to the papillae on the fore part of the tongue: it supplies the maxillary and sublingual glands. f. Nervus abducens. Origin by several filaments from the corpora pyramidalia, and furrow which separates the tuber annulare from the spinal cord.—It penetrates the cavernous sinus, being separated from the blood by a membranous fold, and passes through the foramen lacerum to the external muscle of the eye. In the sinus it receives one or more filaments from the supe- rior cervical ganglion, which, having joined the carotid filament of the Vidian nerve, pass through the carotid canal. g. Nervus facialis. Origin from the fissure which sepa- rates the tuber annulare and spinal cord, above, and a little on the outside of, the corpus olivare. It pro- ceeds in company with the following nerve to the meatus auditorius internus : passes through the aque- duct of Fallopius to be distributed from the stylo- mastoid foramen to the whole face, the temples, the external ear, the occiput and neck. In the aqueduct it receives the filament of the Vidian nerve : supplies the muscles of the small bones of the ear, and sends off the chorda tympani which, passing from the cavity by the glenoid fissure, joins the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve.

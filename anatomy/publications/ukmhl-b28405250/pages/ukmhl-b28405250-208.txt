98 4. The vas deferens is continued from the inferior extremity of the Epididymis : it mounts in a tortuous course behind tiie testicle, with the other vessels of the cord. It leaves these on reaching the abdomen, descends backwards and inwards, passes behind the umbilical artery, and arrives at the posterior and inferior part of the bladder. It crosses the direction of the ureter, passes on the side of the vesicula seminalis. It is joined by the duct of the vesicula, and approaches the vas deferens of the oppo- site side. The two tubes run between the prostate and urethra, and perforate that canal obliquely. Structure. The vas deferens is formed of two membranes. The internal belongs to the mucous system :â€”the external is dense and resisting, its nature is unknown. o. Vesiculae Seminales. Their connection with the bladder : their situation on the outside of the vasa deferentia. The inferior portion of each vesicula is contracted into a narrow canal, which unites with the vas deferens at a very acute angle. Structure. The vesicula? seminales are membranous re- servoirs consisting of a tortuous canal which gives off laterally appendices, varying in number from four to twenty. The convolutions of the canal and its appendices are closely united by dense cellular membrane. They are composed of two tunics: an external cellular, and an internal mucous mem- brane abounding with villi. 6. The Spermatic cord consists of the spermatic artery and veins, lymphatics, the nerves of the epididymis and of the testicle, the vas deferens, cellular tissue and membranes. The artery and veins are on the fore-part of the cord: the vas deferens behind and on the inside. 7. The Penis is a membranous and vascular organ, formed ! of a prolongation of the integuments : the urethra and gland : the corpora cavernosa : muscles, vessels, and nerves. *

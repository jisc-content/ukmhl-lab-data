11 this writer it forms a sac without an opening. It may be shewn however that the membrane is not continued over the entire heads of the bones without interruption. Vid. Gordon's Anat. I. 260. The synovial membrane is continually bedewed on its free surface by a white, viscous transparent fluid, which is call d synovia—-It has not been analysed in the human subject. This membrane also forms sheaths which in certain situations surround the tendons of muscles, and facilitate their play. ■■ -0 ■ ■ Bones have moreover a strong membranous covering which is called the periosteum, and are bound together by ligaments. These substances belong to the fibrous system. The Fibrous System. This system assumes the membranous form in the perios- teum of bones, the capsules of joints, the aponeuroses fasci® and tendinous sheaths of muscles, and the fascicular form in the tendons and ligaments. The peculiar fibre of this system is hard, slightly elastic, little contractile. In the fascicular form the fibres are paral- lel to each other : in the membranous they cross and are interwoven in all directions. The different portions of this system have very different degrees of vascularity, blood vessels abounding in the pe- riosteum and dura mater, and being scarcely visible in the tendon of muscle. Neither nerves nor absorbents have been demonstrated in this system. Fibrous membrane and tendon are almost entirely con- vertible by boiling in water into gelatine. They scarcelv contain any salts.

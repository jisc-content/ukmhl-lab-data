42 trunks irom the liver, and some from the intestines, which penetrate the diaphragm :—many from the lungs, heart and pericardium. The thoracic duct bends upon itself to pour its contents into the posterior part of the left subclavian vein, where it receives the internal jugular. In its course the duct presents many tortuosities, and very unequal dimensions—at its commencement is an enlarge- ment called reccptaculurn chyli. *2. The absQrbents of the head, upper part of the trunk, and superior extremities, enter the subclavian veins by two principal trunks. a. Axillary Plexus. The superficial and deep seated absorbents of the upper extremity—the superficial of the parieties of the abdomen above the umbilicus, of the thorax and of the back, gain the axillary glands, and passing from one to another with frequent anastomoses, form the axillary plexus. From this plexus, four or five principal branches proceed, which at length coalescing to form one, or some- times two branches, fall on the left side either into the thoracic duct or the subclavian vein. Those of the right side generally coalesce, to form a single trunk, which also receives many branches from the liver, lungs, the heart, and pericardium. b. Cervical Plexus. The superficial and deep seated absorbents of the head, face, and neck, pass through many glands which occupy the triangular space between the trapezius and sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles, and others which lie in the neighbourhood of the internal jugular vein, thus forming many plexus. On each side they at length unite to form a single trunk. The left trunk either opens into the thoracic duct or the left subclavian vein. The right cervical trunk unites with the right subclavian trunk to form a single canal, equal in magnitude to the thoracic duct. This canal opens into the right subclavian vein at the angle where it receives the internal jugular vein. Sometimes the cervical and subclavian absorbents open into the vein separately.

40 alone, similar to the inner coat of veins. Mascagni describes an external coat of cellular membrane. The valves are projections of the inner tunic. Absorbents are more elastic and considerably stronger than veins. . Absorbent, or lymphatic glands, are principally situated in the axilla, the groin, in the neighbourhood of the parotid duct in the face ; in the neck they accompany the jugular veins ; in the chest many are found in the posterior mediastinum, about the bronchi ; in the ab- domen on the sides of the vertebral column behind the mesentery—within the folds of the mesentery, &c. The size of the glands varies from the tenth of a line to an inch or more. Their colour is also variable, grey, yellow, pink, black. The structure of a lymphatic or absorbent gland. A membrane of cellular tissue which is loose externally, and gradually becomes more dense, forms the capsule. The sub- stance of the gland consists of the infinite subdivisions and circumvolutions of the absorbent vessels which enter the gland—the rasa inferentia. These inosculate freely and swell out into little cells. From the surface of these cells arise the small branches which unite to form the rasa cfferentia. Accord- ing to Mascagni, there is no absorbent vessel in the body which does not pass through one absorbent gland at least. Bichat is of opinion that the peculiar substance of the gland is not formed of the subdivisions of the vessels alone. The glands are provided with blood vessels : no nerves have been discovered. 4. The absorbents unite to form three trunks which pour their contents into the subclavian veins. The principal trunk of the absorbents is called the thoracic duct.

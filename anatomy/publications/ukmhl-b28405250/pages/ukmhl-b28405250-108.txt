4S different situations. Bichit considers the neurilema to ap- proach nearer to the nature of the pia mater, (with which it may in many parts be shewn to be continuous,) than of any other membrane: particularly in the nerves of the spine. —0— ). Nerves of the Brain, and of its production. Thirteen pairs of nerves have their origins from the cere- brum, the cerebellum, or upper part of the spinal cord. Of these, all, except the last pair, emerge from the cranium by its foramina. The last pair passes between the cranium and atlas. They are, on each side Nervus Olfactorius. Opticus. Motor oculorum. Patheticus. Trigeminus. Abducens. Facialis. Auditorius. Glosso-pharyngeus. Vagus. Accessorius ad Vaguni. Mypo-glossus. Sub-occipitalis. a. Nervus Olfactorius. Its peculiar softness : its origin by one filament from the posterior margin of the anterior lobe of the brain, by two from the substance of the brain near the corpora striata. Its bulb—its separation into filaments which pass through the cribri- form lamella of the ethmoid bone. Its distribution to the mucous membrane of the nose. h. Nervus Opticus. Its origin from the inferior and pos- terior part of the optic thalamus behind the crura cerebri,—and from the corpora quadrigemina. The course of the two nerves : their commissure : their passage through the foramina optica, and expansion to form the retina. c. Nervus Motor Oculorum. Origin from a depression at the root and fore part of the annular protube-

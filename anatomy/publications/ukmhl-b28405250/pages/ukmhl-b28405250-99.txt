48 Nervous System. 1. The general nervous system is divided into two portions. The one comprises the Brain,—its prolongation the Spi- nal Cord, and the nerves which proceed from these central masses : the other comprises the lesser central masses, called Ganglia, and the nerves which proceed from them. The former portion is denominated the nervous system of animal life—the other, the nervous system of organic life. 2. The peculiar substance of the brain is little understood : on microscopical observation it is found to consist of exceedingly minute globules.—The late dissections of Gall and Spurzhein tend to shew its fibrous disposition: and when steeped in acids or alcohol it assumes a fibrous appearance. From the analysis of Vauquelin, one hun- dred parts consist of 80 of water, 6.35 of peculiar animal extracts, 1.50 phosphorus, and 5.15 of sulphur and phos- phates of potass, lime, and magnesia. It is enclosed in three membranes ; the external is the dura mater, the internal the pia mater: the arachnoid is between the two. 3. The dura mater adheres by one surface to the bones of the cranium, of which it may also be considered as the internal periosteum. The other surface presents a smooth aspect, due to the arachnoid membrane, by which, from physiological reasons, it is supposed to be closely invested. The dura mater belongs to the fibrous system—it sepa- rates into laminae to form sinuses for the veins, and canals for certain of the nerves. The falx cerebri—tentorium and Jalx cerebelli. The blood vessels of this membrane are numerous, no nerves have been discovered. Its extensibility is demonstrated by disease—as hydrocepha- lus. Of the glandules Pacchioni. Of the mode in which the dura mater passes out of the various foramina of the skull. 4. The pia mater, adheres to the substance of the brain b\ means of its numerous small blood-vessels: dips between

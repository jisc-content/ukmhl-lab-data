(>? -lands which have been mentioned, the papilla conicir. llie second are tubercular and are situated in a plane in front ol the former, the papilla fungifonnes. The papilla villosa abound near the apex of the tongue, are very sensible, and are supposed to constitute the. immediate organ of taste. On the lower surface of the tongue is the frenvm, a fold of the mucous membrane, in the median plane. * Behind, the tongue is connected to the epiglottis by folds of tnucous membrane, which have been called the ligaments of the epiglottis. Arteries. The lingual arteries are branches of the external carotids, on the inferior surface they are called raninal. The veins open into the external jugulars, sometimes into the internal. Nerves, derived from the inferior maxillary, the glosso- plmryngei and liypo-glossi.—The two first give their filaments to the lesser papilla* :—the other to the muscles. —0— The Organ of Smf.lj.. 1. The nose, divided by its septum into two distinct cavities, together with certain sinus’, constitutes the organ of smell. 2. The external nose, is formed by cartilaginous produc- tions from the ossa nasi:—a single cartilage forms the dorsum and upper part of the nose—from its inner surface it sends a process to assist the vomer in com- pleting the septum. Two fibro-cartilages form the lower portion of the sides, and the ala?. The septum consists of the nasal lamella of the ethmoid, the vomer and the quadrilateral process from the nasal cartilage.—The car- tilages are united by ligaments. 3. The cavity of each nostril. The direction slightly oblique from before backward. The nostrils; their pos- terior communication with the fauces. The three mea- tus of each nostril:—the superior and middle formed by the convolutions of the ethmoid bone, the inferior meatus by the turbinated bone. E 2

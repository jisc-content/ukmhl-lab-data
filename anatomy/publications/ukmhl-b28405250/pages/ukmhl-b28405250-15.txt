AN ATO M V. $c. The Osseous System. Bone is distinguished from all other animal substances by its peculiar hardness. Its varieties of shape are reducible to three divisions : Long) Flat and Short Bones. Osseous Fibre—Bone is composed of a peculiar fibre, which in all bones is the same: and of common parts. The Osseous fibre is more or less closely arranged in different bones, and in different parts of the same bone. Hence the compact, and reticulated substances of bone.—In general the compact substance is external, and the reticulated, internal: the turbinated bones of the nose present an inverse distribu- tion.—The compact substance abounds in the bodies of the long bones, the reticulated in their heads, and in the short bones. The direction of the fibre is different in different bones— being parallel in the bodies of the long bones, diverging from a point in many of the fiat bones, and crossing in all direc- tions iu the short bones. But in all cases the fibres are so interwoven, that the bone presents no appearance of a lamel- lated structure. Common parts. Blood vessels enter into the structure of bone: absorbents and uerves have not been demonstrated, but there is no doubt of their existence. By chemical analysis: the bone being deprived of its hard parts by steeping in dilute acids, a soft elastic sub- stance remains, which retains the original figure of the bone, and is found to possess the properties of coagulated albumen. • It forms from 35 to 40 per cent, of the whole bone : the hard parts dissolved by the acids consist of about A

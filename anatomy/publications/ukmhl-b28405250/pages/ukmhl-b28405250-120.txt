54 anterior, branches of the first, second, and third cer- vical, which unite after having communicated with the superior cervical ganglion.â€”From this plexus arise nerves, which supply the muscles in the neigh- bourhood of the clavicle, scapula, &c. and the paro- tid gland, and the phrenic nerve. The phrenic nerve, receiving one or two filaments from the brachial plexus, descends between the sub- clavian artery and vein; proceeds in the mediastinum in front of the pulmonary vessels adhering to the pericardium, and is distributed to the diaphragm. In this course it communicates with the inferior cer- vical ganglion, and with the cteliac plexus. c. The brachial plexus is formed from the anterior branches of the four last cervical, and first dorsal nerves : from it proceed the thoracic nerves, the brachial nerves, the scapular nerve. The brachial nerves are the musculo-cutaneous, medianus, radialis, axillaris, ulnaris, cutaneus externus, cutaneus in- terims. 4. There are twelve pairs of Dorsal Nerves, which arise similarly to the cervical, and have similar commu- nications with the last cervical, the first dorsal, with each other and with the dorsal ganglia. The anterior branches send nerves to accompany the arteries in the intercostal spaces. The posterior supply the muscles of the back. 5. There are five pairs of Lumbar Nerves which com- municate similarly with each other, and with the lumbar ganglia: the anterior branches supply the abdominal parietes, the iliac and psoas muscles, the posterior the muscles in the spaces between the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebra:. 6. The lumbar plexus terminates in two principal nerves* to be distributed to the lower extremity, the crural nerve and the obturator nerve.

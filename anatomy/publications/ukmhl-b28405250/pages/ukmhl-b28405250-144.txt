66 middle of the masseter and perforates the buccinator and mucous membrane of the mouth opposite the third molar tooth. The Submaxillan/ Glands lie on the inner surface of the lower jaw near its angles, covered by the disgastricus and mylo-hyoidcus muscles on each side. They are softer than the parotids:—of similar formation. Each opens into the mouth by a single duct, on a papilla near the froenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Glands lie under the tongue on the mylo-hyoidei muscles, they open by single ducts near the orifice of the last-named. Often the submaxillary and sublingual glands have a com- mon duct: sometimes the ducts are numerous. The Saliva is tasteless, inodorous, of specific gravity a little greater than that of water. It is slightly viscous, becomes frothy on the admixture of air. It has a strong attraction for oxygen. It consists principally of water, with a little albumen, soda, muriate of soda, and phos- • phate of lime. 5. The tongue is an organ almost entirely composed of muscles, with intermediate cellular substance. These are connected to a bone called the os hyoides—and are covered by mucous membrane, a production of that which invests the mouth. The os hyoides. Its body, greater and lesser cornua. It is connected by its lesser cornua to the styloid process of the tem- poral bone, by the ligamentum stylo-hyoideum. The general shape of the tongue: the foramen ca>cum— the median line, the mucous glands at the base of the tongue are disposed in a right line on each side; these meet in the median line at an acute angle. /The linguales muscles constitute the principal mass of the tongue : the stylo-glossi, hyo-glossi, and genio-glossi assist. The mucous covering presents three different orders of emi- nences, the posterior are the largest, and are the mucous \

The metatarsus—composed of five bones arranged in a Phalanx:—their description. Ossification from three points. 3- The toes have three phalanges of bones each, excepting the great toe which has only two. Description. Ossi- fication in the bones of the two first phalanges is from three points : in those of the last from a single point. 4. The sesamoid bones of the foot are usually three, all belonging to the great toe :—two being placed near the first joint, and one near the second. 21.

Of the peculiarities of the skeleton in the two sexes— and in the different races of men. —0— The articulating surfaces of recent bones are covered with a thin membrane which is part of the synovial system. The Synovial System. Synovial membrane, presents one surface free and uncon- nected, which is very smooth—and another which adheres to the neighbouring parts.—In joints the adhering surface is connected to those fibrous bands which form the ligaments, by a delicate cellular substance. By long maceration in water synovial membrane is shewn to be cellular. It is not very vascular. Bichat describes this membrane as entirely covering the heads of the opposite bones which form a joint, and as being reflected from them, and adhering to the lateral and other ligaments without solution of continuity, so that according to

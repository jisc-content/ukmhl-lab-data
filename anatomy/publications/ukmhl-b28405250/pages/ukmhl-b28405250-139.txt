The external is a sheath which possesses all the proper- ties of epidermis; the internal, at the root, at least, is a peculiar pulp. The nature of the internal substance is unknown ; it is supposed to be of a vascular nature, the vessels containing the nutrient and colouring sub- stances of the hair. On the thickness of the external coat, the varieties of hair in different parts of the body depend. The chemical analysis of Vauquelin shews that hair contains a quantity of animal matter, resembling mucus, and oily products which contain the colouring principle. The residium after burning hair, (about fifteen parts in a thousand) contains iron, oxide of manganese, phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, silica, and alumina. Black hair contains most iron and manganese : in white hair phosphate of magnesia is found, which is wanting in the other varieties. Nicholson's Journal, Vol. XV. p. 141. The skin is continued inwards by all the apertures of the body, and devolves into the mucous system. Of the Mucous System. Mucous membrane lines the interior of all those cavities which communicate with the air externally. Hence there are two great divisions of this system in the body. The one belongs to the organs concerned in respiration and digestion, the other to the urinary and genital organs. Mucous membrane is connected to all the surfaces which it lines by a cellular tissue which is not liable to be distended by fat, or serous fluid. In this way it is most generally united to a muscular layer. Its other surface is free, and presents many loose folds or duplicatures. Of these many are the effect of organisation, and are not obliterated when the

92 The parenchyme of the spleen appears to consist of the subdivisions of blood-vessels, and the connecting cellular structure. The whitish nodules which are seen in its sub- stance are, according to Haller, fasciculi of these vessels. The splenic artery is from the Ca;liac trunk. The vein belongs to the Portal system. The absorbents assist to form the Thoracic duct. The nerves, from the caeliac plexus, accompany the arteries : in the substance of the viscus they become so small that they cannot be traced. Vid. Haller. Phys. Vol. VI. p. 409- 10. The Pancreas. It is deeply seated in the epigastric region : extending transversely between the laminae of the mesocolon, behind the stomach, between the spleen and duodenum. Structure. Similar to that of the salivary glands. It has no proper serous coat. Its acini are connected by cellular substance : these again are collected into lobuli, which com- pose the whole substance of this viscus. The acini appear to be composed of minute vescicles on which the ultimate divi- sions of the blood-vessels and pancreatic duct unite, directly or indirectly. The duct consists of an internal mucous coat, continuous with the inner membrane of the duodenum : and an external cellular coat. Its course. The arteries are from the branches of the caeliac and supe- rior mesenteric. Its veins belong to the Portal system. Its nerves are from the solar plexus. The Urinary Organs. ]. The urinary organs consist of the kidneys, the renal cap- sules, the ureters, the bladder, the urethra.* * The urethra, forming in the male, an essential part of the generative apparatus, will be considered with it.

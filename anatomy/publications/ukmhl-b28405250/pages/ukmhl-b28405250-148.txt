68 4. 1 he sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal cells open into the superior meatus; the anterior ethmoidal cells, (which communicate with the frontal sinus’,) and the maxillary sinus open into the middle meatus ; the lacrymal duct opens into the inferior meatus. 5. All the nasal cavities are covered with a mucous mem- brane called the Pituitary or Schneiderian membrane : differing in texture in the different parts of the cavity. Towards the orifice of the nostril, the mucous membrane much resembles skin, abounding in sebaceous follicles and hairs : on the septum and meatus, it is pulpy, highly vas- cular and sensible, and abounding in mucous glands : in the sinus’ it is more delicate, its colour less red. 6. The olfactory nerve, dividing into numerous filaments, pierces the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone, and is distributed to the mucous membrane lining the supe- rior and middle meatus alone. It is supposed that the sense of smell is conveyed by this nerve. The trigemini send many branches to the nose. The nasal branch of the ophthalmic, after communicating with the ciliary nerves, returns into the cranium by the foramen ethmoideum, and penetrates the ethmoid bone with the branches of the olfactory nerve. The superior maxillary sends, through the spheno-palatine foramen, the superior, anterior and posterior nasal nerves to the ethmoid cells and posterior part of the septum. The palatine branch supplies the inferior meatus : the alveolar the maxillary sinus. 7. The arteries of the nose are from the internal maxillary, and ophthalmic arteries. —0 — The Organ of Sight. 1. The eye is contained in a pyramidal cavity, called the orbit, which is composed of seven bones of the cranium ; covered by periosteum, and filled, at the bottom, with

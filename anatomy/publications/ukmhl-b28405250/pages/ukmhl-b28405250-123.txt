55 a. The crural nerve, formed by branches from all the nerves which form the lumbar plexus except the fifth. It accompanies the great femoral artery under Poupart’s ligament, being on the outside of, and below, the artery. b. The obturator nerve, formed generally from the second and third lumbar nerves, passes with the artery and vein of the same name through the foramen of the thyroid membrane. 7- There are five pairs of Sacral Nerves. Their gangli- form swelling is within the osseous canal of the sacrum. Their anterior and posterior branches emerge by the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. They communi- cate with the last lumbar, with each other, and, with the exception of the last, with the sacral ganglia. 8. The Sciatic Nerve is formed bv principal branches of the fourth and fifth lumbar, the first, second, and third sacral nerves. It passes from the pelvis by the sciatic notch between the pyriformis and geniini muscles. Be- low the middle of the thigh it is called the Popliteal nerve. 9* The popliteal nerve divides into two principal branches, the tibial and peroneal nerves. The former ends in the internal and external plantar nerves. The Ganglia. The ganglia are small bodies, redish or greyish, situated most generally along the sides of the vertebral column, in the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Their shape is very varia- ble—round, or lenticular, or triangular. They consist of a pulpy nervous substance, whose peculiar nature is unknown, enclosed in a sheath of condensed cellular substance. Ex- ternally the whole ganglion is surrounded by abundant cellular membrane of a loose texture.

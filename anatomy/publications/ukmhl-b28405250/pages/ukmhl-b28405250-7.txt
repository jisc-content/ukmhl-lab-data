PREFACE. Three several methods present themselves by which the Anatomy of organized bodies may be taught. The first is an investigation of the parts according to the natural order of their occurrence from without inwrards : the second according to systematic arrangement, by which those parts are separately considered, which agree in composition and structure: the third according to physiological classification, by which all the parts concurring to the due performance of the same animal or organic function are considered together, how'ever different their structure may be. The first of these methods does not afford the means of generalising the facts observed, nor of facilitating their ready recollection. The last proceeds upon the supposition that much know- ledge of the subject is already attained, and moreover mixes two sciences which ought to be distinct. The second is to be preferred: yet, for many obvious reasons, it cannot be strictly adhered to in practice. Hence the necessity of some work like the preseut, which, proceeding upon a systematic arrangement of parts similar in composition and structure, may afford a succinct view of the whole animal economy, and allow a ready reference to their proper classes of facts, which sometimes, from necessity, have been acquired by un- connected demonstration. Such a work should be something more than a Cata- logue, and less than a full description. It should afford an outline which the student may usefully fill up for himself.

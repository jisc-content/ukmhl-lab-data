47 The arachnoid of the canal is only slightly connected with the pia mater, it accompanies the vertebral nerves until they pass through the dura mater—there it is reflected from them upon the latter membrane. 12. The spinal cord—extends from the tuber annulare to the first lumbar vertebra. --Its weight is from a twentieth to a twenty-fifth of the weight of the whole brain.—Its volume is variable throughout its extent. The anterior and posterior fissures, in the median plane. At its origin anteriorly are four remarkable eminences—the two in- ternal the corpora pyramidalia—-the two external the corpora olivaria.—Behind, is the termination of the calamus scriptorius, and of the fourth ventricle of the brain. — On its sides the spinal cord gives origin to each of the vertebral nerves by an anterior and poste- rior filament:—these unite before passing out of the canal.—The cord is composed of cerebral substance of different colours.— It terminates about the first dorsal vertebra by a considerable protuberance. The origins of the dorsal and sacral nerves give the appearance which has been called cauda equina. —0— The Nerves. Little is known of the composition of nerves. The nerv- ous matter is not found to differ materially from that which forms the brain. It is arranged in filaments. The filaments are collected into fasciculi—and in some instances many such fasciculi enter into the composition of a nerve, whilst in others there is only one. The filaments communicate freely with each other, and also the fasciculi. The sheath which encloses the nervous matter is called Neurilema. It unites the filaments so as to form fasciculi, and the fasciculi when they compose a nerve. It also forms the external sheath of the nerve: differing greatly in tenuity in these

97 upon the substance of the testicle, into which it sends many filaments. These filaments are directed towards the poste- rior edge of the testicle, and subdivide the organ. The parenchyme of the testicle is soft and pulpy ; consisting of the innumerable subdivisions of the arteries, veins, nerves and seminiferous tubes, connected by very delicate cellular membrane. The seminiferous ducts do not ramify, or com- municate will) each other. They open into larger vessels (rasa ejferentia) which anastomose, and at length form ten or twelve principal trunks. These traverse the albuginea at the upper part of the posterior edge, where is an eminence called corpus Highmorianum, and terminate in the epi- didymis. The arteries of the testicle are the spermatic : they also supply the epididymis. The lymphatics form from six to twelve trunks, which pass along the cord, accompany the spermatic artery, and terminate principally in the lumbar glands. The nerves are from the gangliaâ€”they are so small and soft that they cannot be traced into the substance of the testicle. .3. The Epididymis, is a small oblong body, swelling at its two extremities : extending throughout the whole poste- rior edge of the testicle. The anterior swelling adheres strongly to the testicle ; receives the vasa efferentia, and is called the head of the Epididymis. The middle por- tion adheres to it by means of the tunica vaginalis. 'The inferior portion is intimately united to the testicle, and is reflected backwards and upwards to constitute the vas deferens. Structure. The Epididymis consists of a single canal, whose numerous convolutions are folded upon each other. The folds are connected by cellular membrane, and supplied with blood-vessels. Monro counted more than 11,000 such flexures. He found the diameter of the tube to be the eighti- eth part of an inch, and estimated its length at thirty-one feet. G

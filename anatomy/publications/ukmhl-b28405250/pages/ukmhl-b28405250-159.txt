73 humour, and forms many cells, diminishing in magnitude towards its centre : these communicate. The fluid of the vitreous humour has a specific gravity 1.0053 and contains a small quantity of albumen and muriate of soda. 2. The Crystalline Lens. Is received into the concave anterior surface of the vitreous humour. Its capsule adheres to the hyaloid in the way which has been described, and within it the lens floats loosely. It is doubly convex. Its axis cor- responds to the axis of the eye, and is half the breadth of the lens. In an adult the axis of the lens is about one fifth of an inch. Its specific gravity is to that of water as 3 : 2. Its density increases towards the center. It contains much albumen. The substance of the lens is very soft externally,— it becomes much harder towards its nucleus. When put into boiling water, or dilute nitric acid, it separates into eight tri- angular segments, each of which is composed of delicate con- centric lamina1. It is said that two thousand, at least, of such lamina exist—they are connected bv oblique fibres; and in the interstices of the whole a fluid is contained probably similar to that of Morgagni. The posterior surface of the lens is the more convex. The capsule differs from the hyaloid in nature: it contains much more albumen, becoming opaque when treated with alcohol and acids. The lens floats freely within the capsule in the midst of a clear fluid called the humour of Morgagni, derived from the exhalants of the capsule. The vessels of the capsule are from the central artery of the retina : nerves have not been discovered. 3. The aqueous humour is a fluid which occupies the two cham- bers of the eye between the lens and the cornea. The two chambers together have an axis rather exceeding that of the lens. 1 his fluid is in all respects similar to that of the vitreous humour. It is secreted hy the exhalant arteries o! the neighbouring parts, as the ciliary.

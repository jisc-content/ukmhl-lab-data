12 % Of Ligaments. The peculiar fibre is not very closely •arranged in ligament: the uniting cellular tissue is also somewhat loose. Ligaments are found in all the moveable joints : they are interwoven by their opposite extremities into the periosteum of the bones which are to be>so united. W hen they entirely surround the joint they are called capsular ligaments:—when placed in parallel bands they are called lateral ligaments. Ligaments are also found connecting the sides of certain long bones;—they are then called interosseous ligaments. They are also found in situations where no motion is admitted, as in the pelvis, &c. Of Tendons. Tendons are composed of parallel fibres very closely arranged, and united by cellular membrane. In the healthy state very few red vessels are visible. Tendons are generally found at the extremities of mus- cles ; however in some instances they enter into the formation of their middle portion, as in the digastricus and rectus ab- dominis. They are generally covered by a loose cellular tissue, or, when this is wanting, a capsule secreting a lubricous fluid is provided to facilitate motion. Tendons are not attached immediately to the bones, but to their periosteum. The fibres of muscle are inserted into tendon—some- times on one side only, forming the semi-penniform muscles: —sometimes on both sides constituting the penniform. The muscles of organic life, and those which form sphincters have no tendons. Vid. Bichat. Avat. Gener. ii. 296. —0—

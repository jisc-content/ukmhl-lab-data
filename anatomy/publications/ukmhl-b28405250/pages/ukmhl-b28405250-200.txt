94 of the bladder, pass, for the space of nearly an inch, ob- liquely through its parieles, and open into its cavity towards the posterior angles of the triangular space called trigonum vesica;. Description of the course of the ureter. The structure of the calices, of the pelvis, and of the ureter seems to be the same. The external coat is cellular, the internal a production of the mucous membrane of the bladder. Some conceive that the ureters are also provided with mus- cular fibres intermediate to the two coats. Haller, VII. “257• The renal arteries are of great capacity. They leave the aorta at a right angle. There is generally one for each kidney: sometimes three, or more. The veins have no valves : they open into the vena cava. The lymphatics of the kidney open into the thoracic duct. The renal plexus of nerves accompanies the subdivisions of the artery. It communicates with the caeliac, mesenteric and spermatic plexus, and with the splanchnic nerve. The nerves are few, in proportion to the size of the gland. 3. The Renal Capsules, are small bodies, oval in the adult, triangular and granulated in the foetus, which rest upon the upper and inner part of the kidney. They are hollow within. Structure, The external coat is a lamellated cellular tissue, which sends prolongations into the substance of the viscus. The substance of the viscus consists of lobes, lobules and acini. The arteries are from the diaphragmatic, the aorta, the renal arteries : they are proportionably more voluminous in infancy than in advanced age. The veins terminate, on the right side, generally in the vena cava;—on the left in the renal vein. The lymphatics and nerves belong to the renal plexus. 4. The urinary bladder is a membranous and muscular reservoir ; situated, in the adult, in the cavity of the pelvis. Its shape is conical : its dimensions very vari- able. It presents six regions: a superior, an inferior, two lateral, an anterior, a posterior region. The supe-

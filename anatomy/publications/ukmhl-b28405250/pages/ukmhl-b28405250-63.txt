in the heart of brutes are usually called the right auricle and ventricle, the others the left auricle and ventricle. 0. The right auricle—its shape, its appendix. On its back part, and above is the opening of the superior vena cava —lower down is the opening of the inferior cava— between the two is the tubercle of Lower. The edge of the inferior cava is provided with a projecting fold of the investing membrane which is called the Eustachian valve. Below the Eustachian valve and immediately above the opening of the ventricle is the opening of the coronary vein, and its valve. The column# cornea: fossa ovalis: foramina Thebesii—auriculo-ventricular opening. The musculi pectinati. 6. The right ventricle—its triangular shape, the base cor- . responding with the inferior opening of the auricle, and vertex pointing towards the apex of the heart. The columna cornea—chorda tendinea. The superior aper- ture, communicating with the auricle, is fringed with a duplicature of the inner membrane of the heart, which from its shape and use is called the tricuspid valve: another opening above, and more to the left, communicates with the pulmonary artery. The artery as it arises from the ventricle is provided with three valvular duplicatures called semilunar valves. 7. The left auricle—its appendix—the oval fossa—the openings of the two right and two left pulmonary veins, not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening. 8. The left ventricle—its pyramidal figure—the vertex extends nearer to the apex of the heart than that of the right ventricle. The auriculo-ventricular opening fringed by a duplicature of the inner membrane which forms the mitral valve. The columna cornea, and chorda tendinea. The opening of the aorta—its semi- lunar valves.

53 There are seven pairs of Cehvical Nehves—they all arise by two filamentous roots, one from the anterior por- tion of the spinal cord, the other from the posterior, which are separated by the ligamentum denticulatum.— The posterior root is the most considerable. The two pass through the same canal formed by the dura mater.— In this canal the posterior branch forms a gangliform swelling, after which it is joined by the anterior, and the two constitute one nerve. n. Nervus cervicalis primus. Passage between the atlas and axis.—Its gangliform swelling. The anterior branch communicates with the superior cervical ganglion—with the sub-occipitalis and the second cervical nerve. The posterior, communicating with the posterior branch of the sub-occipital and the second cervical, supplies the muscles of the neck : and, perforating the neck, becomes the nervus occi- pitalis major. b. Secundus. The anterior branch communicates with the superior cervical ganglion and with the anterior branches of the first and third cervical, and with the accessory to the vagus. It becomes the nervus occipitalis minor. The posterior branch commu- nicates with the posterior of the second and supplies the muscles of the neck. f. Tertius. Anterior branch communicates, like the former, with the cervical ganglion and the interior branches of the neighbouring nerves. It supplies the muscles in the neighbourhood of the scapula. The posterior branch supplies the deep-seated mus- cles of the neck. The mode in which the /emaining cervical nerves issue from the vertebral canal, and communicate with those im- mediately above and below them, is very similar. d. The cervical plexus, is formed by filaments from the

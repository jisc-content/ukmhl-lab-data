Anteriorly, branches to join the facial, vagus, and hypo- glossal nerves,—a plexus which surrounds the carotid ar- tery and its branches,—branches which unite to form the superior cardiac nerves. b. The middle cervical ganglion sends branches upwards to communicate with the superior ganglion. Downwards, a plexus which surrounds the subclavian artery, and branches which terminate in the inferior ganglion. Outwards, a branch to the sixth cervical nerve. Internally, a plexus which surrounds the thyroid artery, and communicates with the recurrent nerve. Anteriorly, branches which form the middle cardiac nerve. c. The inferior cervical ganglion, sends a branch upwards to communicate with the middle ganglion. Outwards, branches which anastomose with the cervical nerves. Downwards, a plexus to the subclavian, and a branch to communicate with the first dorsal ganglion. Inwards, filaments to communicate with the recurrent and vagus. Forwards, the inferior cardiac nerves. « Cardiac Plexus. The three cardiac nerves of the right side, and those of the left (often only two in number) hav- ing communicated with the vagi and recurrents unite to form a plexus. The cardiac plexus is situated behind the aorta and in front of the pulmonary plexus, to which it sends many filaments : its principal branches accompany the subdivisions of the coronary arteries. Pulmonary plexus, formed by nerves from the inferior cer- vical ganglion, the vagi and recurrent nerves. 3. The thoracic ganglia are generally twelve in number, and are situated in the heads of the corresponding ribs. By their superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, and with the inferior cervical and first dorsal ganglia.

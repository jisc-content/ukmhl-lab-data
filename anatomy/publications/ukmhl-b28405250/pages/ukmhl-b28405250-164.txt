76 Below is the glenoid fissure for the passage of the externus mallei and chorda tympani. The Eustachian tube, nearly two inches in length esta- blishes a communication between the cavity of the tympanum and that of the fauces. One-third of this tube nearest to the ear is osseus, the rest cartilaginous. It begins in front of the promontory, and proceeds forwards and inwards towards the posterior and superior part of the nasal opening. It is lined by a delicate production of the mucous membrane of the fauces. 6. The small bones of the ear are four in number : malleus, incus, os orbiculare, .stapes. They are connected by ligaments so as to form an osseus chain extending across the cavity of the tympanum, from the membrana to the fenestra ovalis. 1. The malleus presents a head, neck, and two processes of which the longer is called the handle. The malleus adheres by the head and handle to the membrana tympani, forming a radius of its circle. 2. The incus : its body connected with the head of the malleus : its two processes, of which the larger is joined to the os orbiculare. 3. The stapes, affixed by its base to the fenestra ovalis. Its two crura unite to form the head which is connected to the os orbiculare. 7. The muscles which move the small bones of the ear, and thus stretch or relax the membrana tympani are four. 8. The labyrinth is the inner and most essential portion of the ear. Its numerous parts are invested by a vascular membrane on which the auditory nerve is expanded. It consists of three subdivisions, the vestibule, semicircular ca?ials, and cochlea. 1. Laxator tympani. 2. Interims mallei. 3. Externus mallei. 4. Stapedius.

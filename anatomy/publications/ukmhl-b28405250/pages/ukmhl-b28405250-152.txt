70 VJl each eye-lid, separated by the caruncula :—near the nose they unite to form a common duct, which is soon dilated into the lacrymal sac. The sac is half an inch in length, adheres to the osseous canal formed by the os lacrymale and frontal process of the maxillary bone, and opens by the nasal duct beneath the turbinated bone of the nose. It is composed of an internal mucous membrane, and an external fibrous coat, which is continuous with the tendon of the orbicularis muscle. 4- The globe of the eye. Its general figure is nearly spherical. The axis bears to the transverse diameter the ratio of eighteen to seventeen. It is formed of seg- ments of different spheres. The larger sphere composes the four posterior fifths, the smaller the anterior fifth. The axis of the eye is not coincident with that of the orbit. The two include an angle of about eight degrees. The axes of the two eyes are parallel. . The eye is formed of membranes and humours. The membranes are l.The sclerotica and cornea. 2. The choroid and iris. 3. The retina. The humours are 1. The vitreous humour. 2. The crystalline lens. 3. The aqueous humour. 1. The sclerotica is a dense fibrous membrane—continous lrom the dura mater of the optic nerve. It forms the posterior four fifths of the external covering of the globe.—It is strength- ened externally by the expanded tendons of the six muscles ol the eye. Behind, it presents an opening for the passage of the optic nerve, which is not in the axis of the globe, but more internal. In front, is the large opening, bevelled on its inner edge for the reception of the cornea. The shape oi the latter opening is somewhat elliptical, the transverse diameter being a little the larger. The cornea, on its convex surface is covered by the trans- parent conjunctiva; behind, it corresponds to the aqueous hu- mour. It is composed of lamina? which are united by cellular substance. They are separable by maceration, and between them a fluid is habitually secreted.

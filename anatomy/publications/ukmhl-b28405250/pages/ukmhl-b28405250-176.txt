82 The Organs oi Digestion. 1. The digestive organs constitute a series of connected cavities :â€”with glandular appendages which communi- cate with them. The former series comprises the Pha- rynx, (Esophagus, Stomach, and Intestinal Canal : the latter the Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas. 2. The Pharynx is a membranous and muscular sac, con- nected above, to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. It is bounded below by the oesophagus, into which it opens on the level of the first rings of the trachea : in front, by the cavities of the mouth, nostrils, and larynx : behind, it rests upon the vertebral column. Structure. It consists of an external muscular coat, and an internal mucous membrane. lor the muscles the pharynx, Vid. p. l6. The mucous membrane is continuous from that of the mouth and nostrils. Its external surface is connected to the muscular layer by loose cellular tissue. It is more red than the corresponding membrane of the mouth and nostrils; presents no villi, but many projections which are the orifices of the mucous ducts. The Pharyngeal arteries are from the external carotid : The nerves from the Glosso-pharyngei, Par Vagum, and two upper Cervical Ganglia. 3. The (Esophagus is continuous w ith the lower portion of the Pharynx. It commences about the fourth or fifth Cervical Vertebra and terminates at the (Esophageal aperture of the Diaphragm. Its direction and connec- tions. Its great dilatability. Structure. An external muscular, and internal mucous coat The muscular coat consists of a transverse and of a longitudinal order of muscles. The mucous membrane is whiter than that of the pharynx, and presents many longitu- dinal folds, which are accidental and not dependant on struc- ture. It has a cuticular covering.

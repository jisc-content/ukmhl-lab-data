91 mucous coat. Sometimes the ductus eholedochus and the pancreatic duct, terminate in the intestine by distinct orifices. The Gall-bladder. Its shape: its situation: connection with the liver. Its structure : a partial serous covering, beneath this is a cellular membrane in which is disposed a network of blood-vessels and lymphatics : an internal mucous coat, continuous with that of the intestines through the ductus eholedochus. At the neck of the gall-bladder the folds of the mucous coat form a species of imperfect valve. The Cystic artery is a branch of the Hepatic: the vein belongs to the Portal system. The ducts consist of two membranes—an external cellular, and internal mucous membrane. Bile. Chemical analysis of Berzelius.

The salts are the muriate, sulphate and phosphate of soda, and phosphate of lime, oxide of iron. 9. The Spleen. Its situation in the left hvpochondrium. Its shape : its concave surface adapted to the cardiac extremity of the stomach. Its magnitude and specific gravity are very variable. Structure. External serous covering, deficient only at the bottom of the fissure on the concave surface. It is connected by its inner surface to the proper membrane of the spleen. This is of a fibrous nature. It sends many delicate produc- tions into the substance of the viscus, which accompany the splenic vessels throughout their extent, it is of a greyish white colour; its cellular filaments decussate in all directions in the substance of the spleen, giving it, when washed, a spongy appearance.

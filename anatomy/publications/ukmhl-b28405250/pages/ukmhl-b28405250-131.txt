59 Externally they communicate with the sacral nerves. Anteriorly, they assist in forming the hypogastric plexus. Internally, branches unite with those of the opposite side forming a species of plexus. The mutual connection of all the ganglia by means of superior and inferior branches forms a continuous nervous chain, which has been very generally called the great sympa- thetic nerve. The Glandular System. Glands are organs formed of a congeries of blood-vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and excretory ducts, which are com- pacted by cellulqr tissue. They differ in texture, shape, magnitude, and proportion of their constituents according to their uses.* They have no where a fibrous structure : are readily rup- tured in any direction, and the ruptured surface is uneven. The resistance which they afford is almost entirely due to the cellular membrane which enters into their composition. The glandular substance, or parenchi/me, in some glands presents small distinct masses or lobes which are united by loose cellular membrane ; such masses are again composed of smaller lobules similarly united, and these again of still less, called acini. This is the structure of the lachrymal and salivary glands, and of the pancreas. â€¢ In others there is no appearance of lobes, or lobules, but the acini alone are uniformly and closely united, by delicate cellular membrane. This is the structure of the liver and kidney. J In others not even the acini are visible, the whole mass * True glands, or those which have an excretory duct, and se- parate a fluid from the blood, have been called conglobate glands, to distinguish them from the amglomenUt masses of the lymphatics, improperly called glands.

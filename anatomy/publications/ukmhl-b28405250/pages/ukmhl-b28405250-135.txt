61 A peculiar fibrous substance interwoven in all directions essentially composes the skin.—The fibres are most closely arranged on the outer surface,—on the inner, they leave in most parts of the body areolar spaces which are tilled with fat. These areola? are not found in the fore- head, back of the hand, scrotum, &c., in such parts the inner surface of the corium is smooth. Blood vessels, absorbents, and nerves abound in the corium : the external surface is by far the most vascular. This portion of the skin possesses great elasticity and contractility: on boiling in water it may be entirely dis- solved—the liquor is found to contain gelatine. The Papilla are small eminences on the external sur- face of the corium, which in certain situations, as the extremities of the fingers, and toes, and palms of the hands, are regularly arranged, and present the striated appearance observable in those parts. They are highly sensible and peculiarly constitute the organ of touch. It is probable that many nervous filaments terminate on these eminences, though there be no direct proof of this. Sebaceous Follicles. These are numerous small cells which occupy the substance of the corium, and coin- inunicate by narrow ducts with the external air. The. corium is perforated bv canals for the passage of the hairs, whose direction is oblique to its surface. 4. The Epidermis is a thin, transparent, colourless mem- brane—less elastic than the true skin, closely adhering to it—and following exactly all its folds and inequalities. It has nearly the same thickness throughout,—except in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. B hen removed from the corium no pores are percep- tible in the epidermis,—but there is no doubt of their existence : neither can the perforations for the hairs and the ducts of the sebaceous glands be seen, even with a microscope, which certainly exist.

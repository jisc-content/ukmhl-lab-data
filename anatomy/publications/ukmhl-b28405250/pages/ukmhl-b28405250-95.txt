41 CoUHSE OF THE ABSORBENTS. 1. All the absorbents of the lower extremities, and of the abdomen, with those of a great part of the chest, con- tribute to form the thoracic duct. a. Inguinal Plexus. The superficial absorbents of the lower extremity—of the perineum—of the loins—of the parieties of the abdomen—of the external parts of generation—the greater part of the deep seated absorbents of the lower extremity, pass through the inguinal glands, and form the inguinal plexus. On emerging from these glands, they follow the course of the external iliac artery, and form with the glands there the two iliac plexus. b. Hypogastric Plexus. Many deep seated absorbents of the lower extremity following the course of the obturator, sciatic and glutreal vessels, gain the neighbourhood of the hypogastric artery, and form there the hypogastric plexus. This plexus also receives absorbents from the portions of the colon and ileon situated in the left lumbar region—the deep seated absorbents of the penis and clitoris—those of the prostate, vesiculae seminales, bladder and rectum—those of the neck of the uterus. c. Lumbar Plexus. The two hypogastric and iliac plexus inti- mately unite near the last lumbar vertebra—and entering the lumbar glands, form the lumbar plexus. This plexus also receives the deep seated absorbents of the loins—the absorbents of the testicles, broad ligaments and fundus of the uterus—those of the kidneys. d. Thoracic Duct. About the first lumbar vertebra, four or five trunks, into which the absorbents of the lumbar plexus are collected, receiving the absorbents of the stomach, intestines, spleen, pancreas, and the greater portion of those of the liver, unite to form the origin of the thoracic duct. Whilst in the abdomen it lies behind the aorta. In its passage through the thorax it is found between the aorta and vena azygos. In its qourse it receives many

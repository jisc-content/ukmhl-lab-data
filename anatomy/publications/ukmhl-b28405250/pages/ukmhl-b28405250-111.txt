49 ranee, l>\ several filaments. The course of the nerve between the arteria profunda cerebri and posterior cerebelli through the cavernous sinus, being sepa- rated from the blood which it contains by a fold of cellular membrane. Its passage through the fora- men lacerum—distribution to the levator palpebra;, obliquus inferior, and all the straight muscles of the eve except the external. i1. Nervus Patheticus. Origin from the sides of the valvula Vieussenii behind the corpora quadrigemina, —its passage through the same channel in which the last is received,—its distribution to the obliquus superior muscle of the eye. e. Nenus■ Trigeminus. Origin from the tuber annulare near the crura cerebelli, by numerous distinct and parallel filaments.— Passage of the nerve in its proper sheath formed by the dura mater to the inter- nal temporal fossa. The nodus within the canal, bearing some resemblance to a ganglion, at which the nerve divides into three portions, the ophthalmic, the superior maxillary, and the inferior maxillary nerves. 1. The Ophthalmic Nerve—passes in a sheath of the dura mater to the canal in the cavernous sinus in which are the motor oculorum and patheticus. Enters the orbit by the foramen lacerum, and divides into three branches, the lacrymal, nasal and frontal branches.—The first of these supplies the lacrymal gland, the second sends a filament to the ophthalmic ganglion. -• Superior Maxillary nerve.—Passage out of the cranium by the foramen rotundum — tire orbitar branch.—The swelling of the nerve called the sphcno-palatine ganglion — from which proceed the palatine and Vidian nerves—the branches of the latter nerve to the aqueduct of Fallopius to join the facial nerve—and to the carotid canal to join the superior cervical ganglion. The superior maxillary then gives off D

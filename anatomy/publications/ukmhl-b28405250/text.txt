CAMBKIDGE: PRINTED AT TIIF. VNtVERSITY PRESS.vV co«#. fir*- Of <s\c\t*** % Or VPREFACE. Three several methods present themselves by which the Anatomy of organized bodies may be taught. The first is an investigation of the parts according to the natural order of their occurrence from without inwrards : the second according to systematic arrangement, by which those parts are separately considered, which agree in composition and structure: the third according to physiological classification, by which all the parts concurring to the due performance of the same animal or organic function are considered together, how'ever different their structure may be. The first of these methods does not afford the means of generalising the facts observed, nor of facilitating their ready recollection. The last proceeds upon the supposition that much know- ledge of the subject is already attained, and moreover mixes two sciences which ought to be distinct. The second is to be preferred: yet, for many obvious reasons, it cannot be strictly adhered to in practice. Hence the necessity of some work like the preseut, which, proceeding upon a systematic arrangement of parts similar in composition and structure, may afford a succinct view of the whole animal economy, and allow a ready reference to their proper classes of facts, which sometimes, from necessity, have been acquired by un- connected demonstration. Such a work should be something more than a Cata- logue, and less than a full description. It should afford an outline which the student may usefully fill up for himself.IV In some instances of complexity or of difficulty, the result of his labours may be recorded for the means of a more ready recollection. In others, when, from the limited nature of a course of lectures, facts only can be stated, whilst the detail of laborious experiment by which they have been attained, is but distantly alluded to, full reference should be given to the best original authors, for the assistance of those who wish to institute a more complete enquiry. These different objects are aimed at in the following work. There is a difficulty in the commencement of all sci- ences, the mathematical excepted, which it seems impossible to remove. Let description begin where it will, it will still be found that some information is anticipated:—that some- thing is always supposed known, which it is one object of the undertaking to teach. To elude this difficulty in Ana- tomy, it appears advisable, previous to the formal demon- stration of the parts, to enter upon some general views of the structure and functions of animals. The less perfect orders of animals which execute organic functions alone, present an obvious mode of ascertaining the instruments of such functions, and the phenomena which attend their per- formance. By ascending in the scale of creation these are observed to be combined with others more elaborate:— with the power of voluntary motion, and of speech—with the exercise of the organs of sense, and of the intellectual faculties. The introductory Lecture will comprise such a review ; it will afford a general notion of the objects of the Course. Thus the ear will be familiarised to the language of the science, and the imagination interested in its pursuit. Trin. Coll. Jan. 9, 1822.ANA LYSIS. OF A COURSE OF LECTURES, £ c. 1. Anatomy, in its strict sense, is the science which teaches the structure of organised bodies by means of mechanical division of their parts. In its more extended sense, it teaches not only the structure of such bodies, but also the nature and properties of those ultimate components to which their different parts may be reduced by mechanical, chemical, or other powers. 2. Physiology is that branch of Natural Philosophy, which describes and explains the phenomena peculiar to living bodies in health and in disease.I .PART I Anatomy of the Human Body. /7 A > if * ' f ' ‘AN ATO M V. $c. The Osseous System. Bone is distinguished from all other animal substances by its peculiar hardness. Its varieties of shape are reducible to three divisions : Long) Flat and Short Bones. Osseous Fibre—Bone is composed of a peculiar fibre, which in all bones is the same: and of common parts. The Osseous fibre is more or less closely arranged in different bones, and in different parts of the same bone. Hence the compact, and reticulated substances of bone.—In general the compact substance is external, and the reticulated, internal: the turbinated bones of the nose present an inverse distribu- tion.—The compact substance abounds in the bodies of the long bones, the reticulated in their heads, and in the short bones. The direction of the fibre is different in different bones— being parallel in the bodies of the long bones, diverging from a point in many of the fiat bones, and crossing in all direc- tions iu the short bones. But in all cases the fibres are so interwoven, that the bone presents no appearance of a lamel- lated structure. Common parts. Blood vessels enter into the structure of bone: absorbents and uerves have not been demonstrated, but there is no doubt of their existence. By chemical analysis: the bone being deprived of its hard parts by steeping in dilute acids, a soft elastic sub- stance remains, which retains the original figure of the bone, and is found to possess the properties of coagulated albumen. • It forms from 35 to 40 per cent, of the whole bone : the hard parts dissolved by the acids consist of about A2 °0 Per cent, of phosphate of lime, and 10 per cent, of carbonate of lime.

Cartilage is the term given to all those substances which are commonly called gristle. Its firmness—its great elastic city—its splendid pearly colour distinguish it from other animal substances. It resists putrefaction in a very great degree—it is nearly entirely dissolved by boiling in water—on desiccation it be- comes yellow, contracts, and loses its elasticity. On close inspection, it is found to be composed of fibres, which are interwoven in all directions, more or less closely connected by cellular substance in different parts of the body. No red vessels are found in cartilage in the healthy state —no nerves have been traced into its substance: nor have absorbents been demonstrated. Cartilage differs much in appearance according as it is found, 1. At the extremities of those bones which admit of motion, 2. On the articular sur- faces of immoveable bones, 3. When it assists in forming the boundaries of certain cavities, as the chest, nose, &c.

Of the peculiarities of the skeleton in the two sexes— and in the different races of men. —0— The articulating surfaces of recent bones are covered with a thin membrane which is part of the synovial system. The Synovial System. Synovial membrane, presents one surface free and uncon- nected, which is very smooth—and another which adheres to the neighbouring parts.—In joints the adhering surface is connected to those fibrous bands which form the ligaments, by a delicate cellular substance. By long maceration in water synovial membrane is shewn to be cellular. It is not very vascular. Bichat describes this membrane as entirely covering the heads of the opposite bones which form a joint, and as being reflected from them, and adhering to the lateral and other ligaments without solution of continuity, so that according toI11 this writer it forms a sac without an opening. It may be shewn however that the membrane is not continued over the entire heads of the bones without interruption. Vid. Gordon's Anat. I. 260. The synovial membrane is continually bedewed on its free surface by a white, viscous transparent fluid, which is call d synovia—-It has not been analysed in the human subject. This membrane also forms sheaths which in certain situations surround the tendons of muscles, and facilitate their play. ■■ -0 ■ ■ Bones have moreover a strong membranous covering which is called the periosteum, and are bound together by ligaments. These substances belong to the fibrous system. The Fibrous System. This system assumes the membranous form in the perios- teum of bones, the capsules of joints, the aponeuroses fasci® and tendinous sheaths of muscles, and the fascicular form in the tendons and ligaments. The peculiar fibre of this system is hard, slightly elastic, little contractile. In the fascicular form the fibres are paral- lel to each other : in the membranous they cross and are interwoven in all directions. The different portions of this system have very different degrees of vascularity, blood vessels abounding in the pe- riosteum and dura mater, and being scarcely visible in the tendon of muscle. Neither nerves nor absorbents have been demonstrated in this system. Fibrous membrane and tendon are almost entirely con- vertible by boiling in water into gelatine. They scarcelv contain any salts. Vid. Philosoph. Transact. 179912 % Of Ligaments. The peculiar fibre is not very closely •arranged in ligament: the uniting cellular tissue is also somewhat loose. Ligaments are found in all the moveable joints : they are interwoven by their opposite extremities into the periosteum of the bones which are to be>so united. W hen they entirely surround the joint they are called capsular ligaments:—when placed in parallel bands they are called lateral ligaments. Ligaments are also found connecting the sides of certain long bones;—they are then called interosseous ligaments. They are also found in situations where no motion is admitted, as in the pelvis, &c. Of Tendons. Tendons are composed of parallel fibres very closely arranged, and united by cellular membrane. In the healthy state very few red vessels are visible. Tendons are generally found at the extremities of mus- cles ; however in some instances they enter into the formation of their middle portion, as in the digastricus and rectus ab- dominis. They are generally covered by a loose cellular tissue, or, when this is wanting, a capsule secreting a lubricous fluid is provided to facilitate motion. Tendons are not attached immediately to the bones, but to their periosteum. The fibres of muscle are inserted into tendon—some- times on one side only, forming the semi-penniform muscles: —sometimes on both sides constituting the penniform. The muscles of organic life, and those which form sphincters have no tendons. Vid. Bichat. Avat. Gener. ii. 296. —0—Med. Observ. and Enquiries, Vol. II. p. 29. 13 The Cellular System. Cellular membrane is somewhat grey in colour—highly extensible aud contractile—presenting cellsWhich are formed of delicate transparent laminae. These cells are very varia- ble in shape and magnitude. Proofs that the cells commu- nicate. Of the extensive distribution of this membrane through- out the whole body—Of the mode in which it enters into the formation of almost every organ. It resists putrefaction and the effects of maceration in a degree superior to most other textures. On boiling in water it dissolves and forms gelatine. The common systems which enter into the composition of cellular membrane are bloodvessels, exhalants, absorb- ents and nerves. The fluids which the cellular membrane contains are serum and fat. The serous fluid generally abounds most in those situa- tions where there is no fat, as the scrotum, eyelids, &c.— though this remark does not apply to the cellular substance which surrounds mucous membranes, arteries and veius, &c. The fat is differently disposed in different parts of this system—abounding in some, and being totally deficient in others. Its disposition, consistence and colour also vary at different periods of life. The serous fluid and fat are not lodged in the same or even similar cavities of this membrane, for the saccuii which contain the fat do not communicate. Hence this system is divided by l)r. \\ . Hunter into two portions: that which contains serous fluid being called the reticular, and that which contains fat, the adipose cellular membrane. V ide14 The M uscular System. The fibre of muscle is of a peculiar nature. It varies in diameter, as seen by the naked eye, from the twentieth to the hundredth part of an inch. When viewed by a micro- scope this fibre is seen to consist of others placed parallel to each other which are still smaller. From Prochaska’s experiments it appears that the fibrous part of any muscle may be resolved into ultimate fibres of the same form and appearance, whose diameter does not exceed the forty-thousandth part of an inch. These are very variable in length : and are supposed to extend in some parts to nearly three feet - they preserve the same diameter throughout: are solid and not perfectly cylindrical. These primary fibres placed parallel to each other, form fasciculi whose tranverse section is never circular. The fas- ciculi are again united by cellular membrane, which is pro- bably also the connecting medium of the smaller fibres. Vid. Gordon's Anat. I. 226. Blood vessels, exhalants, absorbents and nerves enter largely into the composition of muscle: they may be traced between the fasciculi accompanying the sheaths of cellular membrane. The colour of muscle depends upon the blood which circulates in its vessels. By maceration in water, the colour is removed: the water is found to contain the colouring matter, a peculiar extractive substance, albumen with a little phosph. of soda ammonia and lime, and carbonate of lime. The greyish fibrous part which remains undissolved, presents all the characters of the fibrine of the blood., */ t ^ 0 • * C-C 1 y ^ f' 1 ^ y* •**' - ' ** ^" f «***■']*■<- '*!-/■*<. ■--, fr, ,./ ' I I O’ k, , ' J jj 61 ’kin--] fli S ., , ' e«~ • » « ~7 J «* '~<L 4.

Serous membrane is a thin shiniug substance, which is found to line all those cavities which do not communicate with the external air, and to he reflected over the organs contained in such cavities. lienee all serous membranes represent a sac without any opening. The free unconnected surface of the membrane is per- fectly smooth, and is habitually smeared with the fluid from which the name of this system is derived. The connected24 surface is flocculent, and adheres to the parts which it invests by means of cellular substance. This membrane presents great varieties of consistence in different parts of the body. It is thick on the liver, omen- tum, &c. when compared with the delicate arachnoid mem- brane of the brain. It is not very extensible, nor very con- tractile. By maceration it presents a cellular structure, and is at length reduced to a pulp. No peculiar matter or proper fibre enters into the composition of serous membrane, so that it is considered by Bichat as nearly approaching the nature of cellular membrane. Anatomie generate, Vol. II. 556. It is largely supplied with exhalants and absorbents. Nerves have not been traced into its substance. * —0— The Circulating System. 1. The circulating system consists of the heart, the arteries, and the veins. 2. The Heart is a hollow^ muscular organ, representing in figure a three-sided pyramid. It is covered externally and lined internally by a membrane. It presents a base, an anterior and posterior surface, an apex, an anterior and posterior margin. The anterior surface is also superior and convex, the posterior is turned downw ards and is flat. 3. It is divided by a septum into tw'o portions which do not communicate. Each of these portions consist of an auricle and a ventricle which cofnmunicate freely. 4. The auricles occupy the base of the heart—one being anterior when the heart is in its natural position, the other posterior—the ventricles are between the auricles and the apex of the heart, the one anterior the other posterior. The anterior auricle and ventricle, from a reference to the position of the corresponding cavitiesin the heart of brutes are usually called the right auricle and ventricle, the others the left auricle and ventricle. 0. The right auricle—its shape, its appendix. On its back part, and above is the opening of the superior vena cava —lower down is the opening of the inferior cava— between the two is the tubercle of Lower. The edge of the inferior cava is provided with a projecting fold of the investing membrane which is called the Eustachian valve. Below the Eustachian valve and immediately above the opening of the ventricle is the opening of the coronary vein, and its valve. The column# cornea: fossa ovalis: foramina Thebesii—auriculo-ventricular opening. The musculi pectinati. 6. The right ventricle—its triangular shape, the base cor- . responding with the inferior opening of the auricle, and vertex pointing towards the apex of the heart. The columna cornea—chorda tendinea. The superior aper- ture, communicating with the auricle, is fringed with a duplicature of the inner membrane of the heart, which from its shape and use is called the tricuspid valve: another opening above, and more to the left, communicates with the pulmonary artery. The artery as it arises from the ventricle is provided with three valvular duplicatures called semilunar valves. 7. The left auricle—its appendix—the oval fossa—the openings of the two right and two left pulmonary veins, not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening. 8. The left ventricle—its pyramidal figure—the vertex extends nearer to the apex of the heart than that of the right ventricle. The auriculo-ventricular opening fringed by a duplicature of the inner membrane which forms the mitral valve. The columna cornea, and chorda tendinea. The opening of the aorta—its semi- lunar valves.26 9. Externally the heart is covered by serous membrane.— Beneath it are collections of fat, which abounds particu- larly in the groove, separating the auricles and ventricles, and near the apex.— Below the fat is the muscular coat of the heart. The muscular fibre is peculiarly compact, cellular substance being scarcely visible.—The fibres arc formed in the ventricles into three principal strata : the external longitudinal, the middle transverse, the inter- nal oblique. The strata of the septum are, the inner stra- tum of each ventricle, and a middle transverse stratum. 10. The inner surface of the heart is lined by a delicate and smooth membrane, which from physiological con- siderations is supposed to differ in specie, in the right and left cavities. 11. The arteries of the heart are the two coronary arteries. The veins of the heart are collected into one venous trunk, the coronary vein. .Absorbent vessels have been demonstrated in great abundance—running between the serous and muscu- lar coat. The cardiac nerves are derived from the par vagurn, and the great intercostal or sympathetic nerve. 12. The pericardium is the sac which contains the heart, and the origin of the large vessels which spring from it.— Its inner surface is formed by the reflection of the serous membrane from the heart. On the outside of the serous coat is a fibrous production from the tendinous centre of the diaphragm which is insensibly lost on the large vessels.—The pericardium is connected to the pleura; by an abundant loose cellular substance which sometimes contains much fat. Vid. liichat. Anat. Descript. Vol. IV. p. 76. The pericardium is largely supplied with arteries fiom the aorta, the internal thoracic, and diaphragmatic arteries. —0—A21 The Arteries. Arteries are hollow tubes, nearly cylindrical—Two large trunks* arise from the heart: by continual subdivision they are distributed to all parts of the body. There is great variety in the mode of the ramification ot arteries: but in all cases, the sum of the areas of the second- ary branches exceeds the area of the trunk from which they spring. They are remarkable for their elasticity both in the di- rection of their axes, and of their diameters. They are composed of three coats. The inner coat is a production of the membrane which lines the left cavity of the heart—it is very thin, transparent, white, and uniform in its texture, like serous membrane, without any fibrous appearance. It is easily ruptured. The middle is the proper coat of arteries: upon it their strength depends. It is dense and fibrous. The fibres run in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the artery, are disposed in layers, and may be dissected without diffi- culty from the inner coat. They are of a yellow colour, which is seen through the transparent inner tunic. The nature of the middle coat is peculiar. It is not muscular. It is abundantly supplied with blood vessels:—absorbents and nerves have not been demonstrated. The outer coat, which adheres closely to the middle, appears to consist of condensed cellular membrane. * These are, the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle, which delivers the blood to the lungs: and the aorta from the left ventricle, which transmits it to the rest of the body. In the lirst instance the blood conveyed is venom, until it arrives at the mi- nute vessels of the lungs—it then assumes the character of arterial blood, und is returned in this state to the heart. Hence the pul- monary artery does not belong to the arterial system.28 The arterial system consists- of the aorta, its branches, and their subdivisions. 1. The aorta, before it emerges from the pericardium, gives oft’ a. Arteria cordis coronaria dextra. b. Arteria cordis coronaria sinistra. 2. The aorta gives off. at the upper part of its arch a.

Veins are tubes which have their origin in the capillary system, in a mode which is not well ascertained. The smaller veins coalesce to form trunks whose area is always less than the sum of their areas. They run in two different modes, being either superficial, that is, situated under the integuments, or deep-seated, that is, accompanying the arteries. The capacity of the venous system is considerably greater than that of the arterial. In shape they are nearly cylindrical, but, not possessing an elasticity equal to that of the arteries, they collapse w'hen empty. Veins consist of three coats. The inner coat is a prolongation of the delicate mem- brane w'hich lines the cavities of the right side of the heart— it extends from the capillary system throughout the veins and right side of the heart, to the termination of the ultimate branches of the pulmonary vein. It forms by its duplicatures the valves of the veins, whose shape is parabolic, the free edge being nearest to the heart. Valves are not found in all veins, they abound most in the superficial. They are gene- rally disposed in pairs; sometimes three are found together, sometimes there is only one. The middle coat is that w'hich is peculiar to this system. It is disposed in longitudinal fibres. This coat is of much tenuity, so as to be scarcely visible in many of the veins—31 it is thicker in the superficial than in the deep-seated veins, and in the branches than the larger trunks. Its nature is unknown. It differs essentially from the fibrous coat of arteries, and from muscular fibre. It is not found in the sinuses of the brain. The outer coat is formed of a condensed cellular tissue, apparently similar to the corresponding coat of arteries. Veins are well supplied with blood-vessels. Bichat. Anat. Gen. I. 363. All the veins, with the exception of those of the heart, are at length collected into two principal truuks, the ascend- ing and descending cava:; which, with the coronary vein, terminate in the right auricle of the heart. —0— Course of the Veins. 1. The deep-seated veins in general accompany the arteries, and have similar appellations. 2. The superficial veins of the upper extremity are a. Vena cephalica. b. Basilica. c. Mediana. 1. Mediana cephalica. 2. Mediana basilica. The basilic and cephalic veins join the axillary vein. 3. The veins of the integuments and muscles of the head, and of the face, form two great trunks, which unite at the angle of the jaws to form the jugutaris externa,— these are a. Facialis anterior. b. Facialis posterior. 4. The veins of the brain and of its membranes do not accompany the arteries, but arc received into the sinuses38 of the dura mater. The lateral sinus of each side ulti- mately receives the blood of all the others :—passing out of the foramen lacerum posterius, it is called vena j'wgM- laris interna. The sinuses are a. S. Longitudinalis superior. b. S. Lateralis, dexter et sinister. c. <$. Longitudinalis inferior. (L S. Perpendiculars or Torcular Herophili. e. S. Cavernosus, dexter et sinister. /'. S. Circularis. g. S. Petrosus superior, dexter et sinister. h. S. Petrosus inferior, dexter et sinister. i. S. Occipitalis, dexter et sinister. 5. The two subclavian veins are formed by the junction of the axillary and jugular veins. 6. The vena cava superior is formed by the junction of the subclavian veins. 7. Vena azygos. All the intercostal veins of the right side, and those of the left, except some of the superior which open into the subclavian, pour their contents into one common trunk called the vena azygos. After receiving veins from the oesophagus and bronchi it opens into the vena cava just above the pericardium. 8. The superficial veins of the lower extremity open into the femoral and popliteal vein : they are a. Vena saphaena magna. b. Vena saphaena parva. 9. The inferior cava receives the following a. Iliacae interna;. b. Sacra; mediae, r. Lum bares. d. Spermatic*. e. Renales. f. Capsulares. g. Phrenicae inferiores. h. Hepatic*.10. I'cna Porta. The splenic rein reteivts the blood of the vasa brevia, v. gastro-epiploica dextra et sinistra— corouaria ventriculi—duodenalis. The mesenterica infe- rior corresponds to the artery of the same name. The mesenterica superior is formed of all the other intestinal veins. These three brandies unite to form the vena porta4, which after receiving in its course the veins of the pyloric extremity of the stomach and of the duodenum, penetrates the liver, and delivers its contents in all directions to that viscus. The Absorbent System. 1. The Absorbent System is composed of two parts— vessels and glands. 2. Absorbent vessels may be demonstrated in most parts of the body—and are supposed to exist in all. Their origins cannot be discovered even with a microscope. They run in two distinct classes; a superficial and deep seated. The middle sized absorbents differ in their distribution from arteries and veins. 1. When two of them are united together, the trunk is seldom or never larger than either of them separately. 2. Their anastomoses are continual. 3. They seldom run any great distance without dividing Into branches, and again reuniting into trunks. Gordons Anal. The valves of the absorbents are very numerous, they are generally found in pairs, never three together. There is no constancy in their distribution in different subjects, except that valves are generally found where a branch unites with a trunk. The structure of these vessels is determinable only in the larger trunks—thev seem to consist of one coat40 alone, similar to the inner coat of veins. Mascagni describes an external coat of cellular membrane. The valves are projections of the inner tunic. Absorbents are more elastic and considerably stronger than veins. . Absorbent, or lymphatic glands, are principally situated in the axilla, the groin, in the neighbourhood of the parotid duct in the face ; in the neck they accompany the jugular veins ; in the chest many are found in the posterior mediastinum, about the bronchi ; in the ab- domen on the sides of the vertebral column behind the mesentery—within the folds of the mesentery, &c. The size of the glands varies from the tenth of a line to an inch or more. Their colour is also variable, grey, yellow, pink, black. The structure of a lymphatic or absorbent gland. A membrane of cellular tissue which is loose externally, and gradually becomes more dense, forms the capsule. The sub- stance of the gland consists of the infinite subdivisions and circumvolutions of the absorbent vessels which enter the gland—the rasa inferentia. These inosculate freely and swell out into little cells. From the surface of these cells arise the small branches which unite to form the rasa cfferentia. Accord- ing to Mascagni, there is no absorbent vessel in the body which does not pass through one absorbent gland at least. Bichat is of opinion that the peculiar substance of the gland is not formed of the subdivisions of the vessels alone. The glands are provided with blood vessels : no nerves have been discovered. 4. The absorbents unite to form three trunks which pour their contents into the subclavian veins. The principal trunk of the absorbents is called the thoracic duct.41 CoUHSE OF THE ABSORBENTS. 1. All the absorbents of the lower extremities, and of the abdomen, with those of a great part of the chest, con- tribute to form the thoracic duct. a. Inguinal Plexus. The superficial absorbents of the lower extremity—of the perineum—of the loins—of the parieties of the abdomen—of the external parts of generation—the greater part of the deep seated absorbents of the lower extremity, pass through the inguinal glands, and form the inguinal plexus. On emerging from these glands, they follow the course of the external iliac artery, and form with the glands there the two iliac plexus. b. Hypogastric Plexus. Many deep seated absorbents of the lower extremity following the course of the obturator, sciatic and glutreal vessels, gain the neighbourhood of the hypogastric artery, and form there the hypogastric plexus. This plexus also receives absorbents from the portions of the colon and ileon situated in the left lumbar region—the deep seated absorbents of the penis and clitoris—those of the prostate, vesiculae seminales, bladder and rectum—those of the neck of the uterus. c. Lumbar Plexus. The two hypogastric and iliac plexus inti- mately unite near the last lumbar vertebra—and entering the lumbar glands, form the lumbar plexus. This plexus also receives the deep seated absorbents of the loins—the absorbents of the testicles, broad ligaments and fundus of the uterus—those of the kidneys. d. Thoracic Duct. About the first lumbar vertebra, four or five trunks, into which the absorbents of the lumbar plexus are collected, receiving the absorbents of the stomach, intestines, spleen, pancreas, and the greater portion of those of the liver, unite to form the origin of the thoracic duct. Whilst in the abdomen it lies behind the aorta. In its passage through the thorax it is found between the aorta and vena azygos. In its qourse it receives many42 trunks irom the liver, and some from the intestines, which penetrate the diaphragm :—many from the lungs, heart and pericardium. The thoracic duct bends upon itself to pour its contents into the posterior part of the left subclavian vein, where it receives the internal jugular. In its course the duct presents many tortuosities, and very unequal dimensions—at its commencement is an enlarge- ment called reccptaculurn chyli. *2. The absQrbents of the head, upper part of the trunk, and superior extremities, enter the subclavian veins by two principal trunks. a. Axillary Plexus. The superficial and deep seated absorbents of the upper extremity—the superficial of the parieties of the abdomen above the umbilicus, of the thorax and of the back, gain the axillary glands, and passing from one to another with frequent anastomoses, form the axillary plexus. From this plexus, four or five principal branches proceed, which at length coalescing to form one, or some- times two branches, fall on the left side either into the thoracic duct or the subclavian vein. Those of the right side generally coalesce, to form a single trunk, which also receives many branches from the liver, lungs, the heart, and pericardium. b. Cervical Plexus. The superficial and deep seated absorbents of the head, face, and neck, pass through many glands which occupy the triangular space between the trapezius and sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles, and others which lie in the neighbourhood of the internal jugular vein, thus forming many plexus. On each side they at length unite to form a single trunk. The left trunk either opens into the thoracic duct or the left subclavian vein. The right cervical trunk unites with the right subclavian trunk to form a single canal, equal in magnitude to the thoracic duct. This canal opens into the right subclavian vein at the angle where it receives the internal jugular vein. Sometimes the cervical and subclavian absorbents open into the vein separately.48 Nervous System. 1. The general nervous system is divided into two portions. The one comprises the Brain,—its prolongation the Spi- nal Cord, and the nerves which proceed from these central masses : the other comprises the lesser central masses, called Ganglia, and the nerves which proceed from them. The former portion is denominated the nervous system of animal life—the other, the nervous system of organic life. 2. The peculiar substance of the brain is little understood : on microscopical observation it is found to consist of exceedingly minute globules.—The late dissections of Gall and Spurzhein tend to shew its fibrous disposition: and when steeped in acids or alcohol it assumes a fibrous appearance. From the analysis of Vauquelin, one hun- dred parts consist of 80 of water, 6.35 of peculiar animal extracts, 1.50 phosphorus, and 5.15 of sulphur and phos- phates of potass, lime, and magnesia. It is enclosed in three membranes ; the external is the dura mater, the internal the pia mater: the arachnoid is between the two. 3. The dura mater adheres by one surface to the bones of the cranium, of which it may also be considered as the internal periosteum. The other surface presents a smooth aspect, due to the arachnoid membrane, by which, from physiological reasons, it is supposed to be closely invested. The dura mater belongs to the fibrous system—it sepa- rates into laminae to form sinuses for the veins, and canals for certain of the nerves. The falx cerebri—tentorium and Jalx cerebelli. The blood vessels of this membrane are numerous, no nerves have been discovered. Its extensibility is demonstrated by disease—as hydrocepha- lus. Of the glandules Pacchioni. Of the mode in which the dura mater passes out of the various foramina of the skull. 4. The pia mater, adheres to the substance of the brain b\ means of its numerous small blood-vessels: dips between44 all its convolutions—and penetrates its ventricles under the names of telachordidea and plexus chord ides. It con- sists of a multitude of blood-vessels derived from the two vertebral, the basilar, and internal carotid arteries, which are connected by delicate cellular membrane, according to Bichat. The veins of the pia mater open into the sinuses of the dura mater. 5. The arachnoid does not penetrate the anfractuosities of the brain, but passes from one convolution to another : it penetrates, and, according to Bichat, invests the ventri- cles of the brain : supplies sheaths to the vessels and nerves, and as they leave the cranium is reflected from them over the dura mater. It thus presents a sac with- out any opening, and is classed amongst the serous membranes. JN either blood-vessels, absorbents, nor nerves have been demonstrated in it. 6. The brain is divided into two parts, the cerebrum and cerebellum, both of which are symmetrical. 7. The cerebrum—its weight is from thirty-five to forty-five ounces avoirdupois. The two hemispheres divided by the longitudinal Jissure. The convolutions and fossa : their colour. On the upper surface of the cerebrum, are remarked the corpus callosum, its longitudinal ridges, its raphe. On the inferior surface, in the median line, from before backwards, the continuation of the longitudinal fissure—commissure of the optic nerves—pituitary gland and infundibulum—corpora albicantia. On each side of the median line—the fossa in the anterior lobe for the olfactory nerves,—the jissura Sylvii dividing the anterior and middle lobes, — the tractus optici, — the crura cerebri which connect the cerebrum and cerebellum,— the excavation which marks the boundary of the middle and posterior lobes, — the Jissure which, when the membranes are removed, communicates with the lateral ventricles.S/.&f / fj A « ■ ' ^ ** J h f'~~ /•■’•'■ •' r~' £ 1L f -T ” '/"l #x*.<r.

In cutting the hemispheres of the brain horizontally they are observed to be composed of different coloured matters : that which is brownish being for the most part exterior, is called the cortical substance,—that which is white, is called the medullary substance. The nature of both is unknown. The centrum ovale. The dimensions and direction of the lateral ventricles in the three lobes of the brain. The septum lucidum, and cavity formed by the separation of its lamina;. The fornix—its anterior and posterior crura,—of which the former may be traced to the corpora albicantia, the latter diverge from each other and pass into the inferior horn of the ventricles, adhering by one margin to an eminence called the hippocampus or cornu Ammonis, whilst the other margin, being loose, is called corpus fimbriatum or tenia hippocampi. The hippocampus or cornu Ammonis—its bulbous projection called pes hippocampi: the digital cavity. The h/ra, an appearance on the inferior surface of the fornix. The corpora striata. The optic tholami. Tania semi-circu- laris. The foramen commune anterius, by which the two lateral ventricles communicate with each other, and with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus—tela cho- roidea, and vena magna Galcni. The anterior commis- sure of the brain. The foramen commune posterius,— the posterior commissure. The pineal gland,—its pedun- culi—its concretions, or acervuli, composed of phosphate of lime. Tubercula (jitadrigemiua. Valvulu Vieussenii, which covers the fourth ventricle. In the third ventricle are, the iter ad infitndulum (a substance which extends to the pituitary gland), and, below the posterior com- missure, the iter a tertio ad i/uartum ventriculum. In the fourth ventricle is the groove called calamus scrip- torins.9. I lie cerebellum : its weight about a seventh part of that of the cerebrum: its hemispheres:—its laminated struc- ture. On its upper surface, the superior vermiform process. On the lower surface, in the median line, the tuber annulare, where the crura cerebelli join the crura cerebri: laterally , the inferior vermiform process.—The cortical matter largely abounds m the cerebellum, and is intermixed with its white substance in such a way as to produce, in a vertical section, the appearance called arbor vita. 10. The spinal cord is that production of the brain, which passes through the foramen magnum, and, with its mem- branes, occupies the vertebral canal. 11. The membranes of the spinal cord. The dura mater lines the vertebral canal, but does not adhere to it very intimately. It affords small sheaths to each of the vertebral nerves as it passes out of the corresponding foramen. It subdivides at the lower part of the canal into numerous sheaths which accompany the sacral nerves. The dura mater of the canal is supposed to he covered on its internal surface by the reflected arachnoid. The pin mater sends a production which immediately covers the cord, and is more membranous and less vascular than the pia mater of the brain. It adheres to the cord by means of the minute subdivisions of its arteries, derived from the vertebral, the inferior thyroid, the intercostal and lumbar arteries. On its external surface it corresponds to the arachnoid membrane. The ligamentum denticulatum is a narrow membranous band whose nature is unknown. It adheres by its inner margin to the pia mater, throughout the whole length of the canal, and by serrated projections on its outer margin to the dura mater of the canal. The spaces between these projections are free.—The anterior and posterior surfaces of the mem- brane are unconnected with the neighbouring parts.47 The arachnoid of the canal is only slightly connected with the pia mater, it accompanies the vertebral nerves until they pass through the dura mater—there it is reflected from them upon the latter membrane. 12. The spinal cord—extends from the tuber annulare to the first lumbar vertebra. --Its weight is from a twentieth to a twenty-fifth of the weight of the whole brain.—Its volume is variable throughout its extent. The anterior and posterior fissures, in the median plane. At its origin anteriorly are four remarkable eminences—the two in- ternal the corpora pyramidalia—-the two external the corpora olivaria.—Behind, is the termination of the calamus scriptorius, and of the fourth ventricle of the brain. — On its sides the spinal cord gives origin to each of the vertebral nerves by an anterior and poste- rior filament:—these unite before passing out of the canal.—The cord is composed of cerebral substance of different colours.— It terminates about the first dorsal vertebra by a considerable protuberance. The origins of the dorsal and sacral nerves give the appearance which has been called cauda equina. —0— The Nerves. Little is known of the composition of nerves. The nerv- ous matter is not found to differ materially from that which forms the brain. It is arranged in filaments. The filaments are collected into fasciculi—and in some instances many such fasciculi enter into the composition of a nerve, whilst in others there is only one. The filaments communicate freely with each other, and also the fasciculi. The sheath which encloses the nervous matter is called Neurilema. It unites the filaments so as to form fasciculi, and the fasciculi when they compose a nerve. It also forms the external sheath of the nerve: differing greatly in tenuity in these4S different situations. Bichit considers the neurilema to ap- proach nearer to the nature of the pia mater, (with which it may in many parts be shewn to be continuous,) than of any other membrane: particularly in the nerves of the spine. —0— ). Nerves of the Brain, and of its production. Thirteen pairs of nerves have their origins from the cere- brum, the cerebellum, or upper part of the spinal cord. Of these, all, except the last pair, emerge from the cranium by its foramina. The last pair passes between the cranium and atlas. They are, on each side Nervus Olfactorius. Opticus. Motor oculorum. Patheticus. Trigeminus. Abducens. Facialis. Auditorius. Glosso-pharyngeus. Vagus. Accessorius ad Vaguni. Mypo-glossus. Sub-occipitalis. a. Nervus Olfactorius. Its peculiar softness : its origin by one filament from the posterior margin of the anterior lobe of the brain, by two from the substance of the brain near the corpora striata. Its bulb—its separation into filaments which pass through the cribri- form lamella of the ethmoid bone. Its distribution to the mucous membrane of the nose. h. Nervus Opticus. Its origin from the inferior and pos- terior part of the optic thalamus behind the crura cerebri,—and from the corpora quadrigemina. The course of the two nerves : their commissure : their passage through the foramina optica, and expansion to form the retina. c. Nervus Motor Oculorum. Origin from a depression at the root and fore part of the annular protube-// V -t i Bfc?—c J / ' / 7 /* c?1 y MAr < ' / -..-/ < < <fe ■' » J - ; * ••' vC.. - / 'A •) ' / -■, #■ & w f* /fci A* .. - ** */ /: 5Z- /: ■. -I- /' h A .... it / x;;r / K A V* } 4 .' . i* :' *■ "? ? - •*“ */ „.

The course of the nerve between the arteria profunda cerebri and posterior cerebelli through the cavernous sinus, being sepa- rated from the blood which it contains by a fold of cellular membrane. Its passage through the fora- men lacerum—distribution to the levator palpebra;, obliquus inferior, and all the straight muscles of the eve except the external. i1. Nervus Patheticus. Origin from the sides of the valvula Vieussenii behind the corpora quadrigemina, —its passage through the same channel in which the last is received,—its distribution to the obliquus superior muscle of the eye. e. Nenus■ Trigeminus. Origin from the tuber annulare near the crura cerebelli, by numerous distinct and parallel filaments.— Passage of the nerve in its proper sheath formed by the dura mater to the inter- nal temporal fossa. The nodus within the canal, bearing some resemblance to a ganglion, at which the nerve divides into three portions, the ophthalmic, the superior maxillary, and the inferior maxillary nerves. 1. The Ophthalmic Nerve—passes in a sheath of the dura mater to the canal in the cavernous sinus in which are the motor oculorum and patheticus. Enters the orbit by the foramen lacerum, and divides into three branches, the lacrymal, nasal and frontal branches.—The first of these supplies the lacrymal gland, the second sends a filament to the ophthalmic ganglion. -• Superior Maxillary nerve.—Passage out of the cranium by the foramen rotundum — tire orbitar branch.—The swelling of the nerve called the sphcno-palatine ganglion — from which proceed the palatine and Vidian nerves—the branches of the latter nerve to the aqueduct of Fallopius to join the facial nerve—and to the carotid canal to join the superior cervical ganglion. The superior maxillary then gives off D50 the alveolar nerve, or posterior dentium,—passes through the infra-orbitar canal, gives off the anterior dentium, and emerging is called the infra-orbital nerve, and is distri- buted to the muscles and integuments of the face. 3. Inferior Maxillary Nerve—passes from the cranium by the foramen ovale.—Divides into two principal portions, of •which the external sends branches to the temporal, masseter, and pterygoid muscles, and the internal supplies the proper inferior maxillary, lingual and auricular nerves. The lin- gual nerve may be traced to the papillae on the fore part of the tongue: it supplies the maxillary and sublingual glands. f. Nervus abducens. Origin by several filaments from the corpora pyramidalia, and furrow which separates the tuber annulare from the spinal cord.—It penetrates the cavernous sinus, being separated from the blood by a membranous fold, and passes through the foramen lacerum to the external muscle of the eye. In the sinus it receives one or more filaments from the supe- rior cervical ganglion, which, having joined the carotid filament of the Vidian nerve, pass through the carotid canal. g. Nervus facialis. Origin from the fissure which sepa- rates the tuber annulare and spinal cord, above, and a little on the outside of, the corpus olivare. It pro- ceeds in company with the following nerve to the meatus auditorius internus : passes through the aque- duct of Fallopius to be distributed from the stylo- mastoid foramen to the whole face, the temples, the external ear, the occiput and neck. In the aqueduct it receives the filament of the Vidian nerve : supplies the muscles of the small bones of the ear, and sends off the chorda tympani which, passing from the cavity by the glenoid fissure, joins the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve.A51 h. Menus auditorius—origin from the sides of the fourth ventricle and tuber annulare, the filaments forming a fasciculus which embraces the facial nerve: the two thus proceed to the meatus auditorius interims. The auditory nerve, then separating itself from the facial, is divided into three branches to be distributed to the cochlea, the vestibule, and the semicircular canals of the ear. i. Men us glosso-pharyngeus. Origin from the spinal cord behind the corpus olivare—between the facial nerve and the par vagum. It enters a peculiar sheath formed by the dura mater, emerges from the cranium by the foramen lacerum posterius, passes over the internal carotid, and is distributed to the tongue near the insertion of the hvo-glossus muscle. It also sends filaments to the constrictors of the pha- rynx. In its passage it communicates w ith the supe- rior cervical ganglion, and par vagum. k. Menus Vagus. Origin immediately below the glosso- pharyngeal nerve by filaments which are formed into fasciculi: passes in its peculiar canal formed by the dura mater,—emerges by the foramen lacerum poste- rius, being situated between the glosso-pharyngeal and the jugular vein. In the neck it lies on the outside of, and behind, the carotid artery—passes over the subclavian artery on the right side, and the arch of the aorta on the left, behind the bronchi, to gain the oesophagus, along the sides of which the two nerves pass. Penetrating the oesophageal aper- ture of the diaphragm they are distributed to the stomach. In the neck it communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and supplies the larvnx :—forms with filaments from the superior cervical ganglion the pharyngeal plexus. The cardiac ph i us is formed by filaments from the n -252 vagi, the three cervical ganglia, and the recurrent nerves. The pulmonary plexus by filaments from the vagi, recurrent, and inferior cervical ganglia. The recurrent nerves are sent oft by the vagi, when in the thorax, to supply the larynx. Nervus accessorius ad par vagum. Origin from the spinal cord, about the third or fourth cervical verte- bra:—ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and posterior branches of the cervical nerves, receiv- ing filaments from the cord as it ascends.—It enters the cranium by the foramen magnum, gains the membranous canal of the par vagum, and passes out of the cranium with that nerve. It joins the fila- ments of the par vagum which are distributed to the larynx and pharynx, communicates with the cervical plexus, and supplies certain muscles of the neck and back. Nervus hypo-glossus, or lingualis. Origin by many filaments between the corpus olivare and pyramidale : is received in a sheath of the dura mater, and passes out of the anterior condyloid foramen. In the neck, having received filaments from the superior cervical ganglia, it forms two principal nerves, the cervicalis descendens, and the hi/po-glossus. The former assists some of the cervical nerves to form the middle cer- vical plexus :—the latter supplies all the muscles of the os hyoides, the genio-glossus, the sterno-thyroi- deus and the maxillary gland. Nervus sub-occipitalis. Origin from the spinal cord, by two branches which the ligamentum denticulatum separates, on the level of the occipital condyle. The small gangliform swelling between the vertebral artery and the atlas. The anterior branch commu- nicates with the hypo-glossus, vagus, and superior cervical ganglion. The posterior is distributed to the muscles on the back of the neck.53 There are seven pairs of Cehvical Nehves—they all arise by two filamentous roots, one from the anterior por- tion of the spinal cord, the other from the posterior, which are separated by the ligamentum denticulatum.— The posterior root is the most considerable. The two pass through the same canal formed by the dura mater.— In this canal the posterior branch forms a gangliform swelling, after which it is joined by the anterior, and the two constitute one nerve. n. Nervus cervicalis primus. Passage between the atlas and axis.—Its gangliform swelling. The anterior branch communicates with the superior cervical ganglion—with the sub-occipitalis and the second cervical nerve. The posterior, communicating with the posterior branch of the sub-occipital and the second cervical, supplies the muscles of the neck : and, perforating the neck, becomes the nervus occi- pitalis major. b. Secundus. The anterior branch communicates with the superior cervical ganglion and with the anterior branches of the first and third cervical, and with the accessory to the vagus. It becomes the nervus occipitalis minor. The posterior branch commu- nicates with the posterior of the second and supplies the muscles of the neck. f. Tertius. Anterior branch communicates, like the former, with the cervical ganglion and the interior branches of the neighbouring nerves. It supplies the muscles in the neighbourhood of the scapula. The posterior branch supplies the deep-seated mus- cles of the neck. The mode in which the /emaining cervical nerves issue from the vertebral canal, and communicate with those im- mediately above and below them, is very similar. d. The cervical plexus, is formed by filaments from the54 anterior, branches of the first, second, and third cer- vical, which unite after having communicated with the superior cervical ganglion.—From this plexus arise nerves, which supply the muscles in the neigh- bourhood of the clavicle, scapula, &c. and the paro- tid gland, and the phrenic nerve. The phrenic nerve, receiving one or two filaments from the brachial plexus, descends between the sub- clavian artery and vein; proceeds in the mediastinum in front of the pulmonary vessels adhering to the pericardium, and is distributed to the diaphragm. In this course it communicates with the inferior cer- vical ganglion, and with the cteliac plexus. c. The brachial plexus is formed from the anterior branches of the four last cervical, and first dorsal nerves : from it proceed the thoracic nerves, the brachial nerves, the scapular nerve. The brachial nerves are the musculo-cutaneous, medianus, radialis, axillaris, ulnaris, cutaneus externus, cutaneus in- terims. 4. There are twelve pairs of Dorsal Nerves, which arise similarly to the cervical, and have similar commu- nications with the last cervical, the first dorsal, with each other and with the dorsal ganglia. The anterior branches send nerves to accompany the arteries in the intercostal spaces. The posterior supply the muscles of the back. 5. There are five pairs of Lumbar Nerves which com- municate similarly with each other, and with the lumbar ganglia: the anterior branches supply the abdominal parietes, the iliac and psoas muscles, the posterior the muscles in the spaces between the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebra:. 6. The lumbar plexus terminates in two principal nerves* to be distributed to the lower extremity, the crural nerve and the obturator nerve.n55 a. The crural nerve, formed by branches from all the nerves which form the lumbar plexus except the fifth. It accompanies the great femoral artery under Poupart’s ligament, being on the outside of, and below, the artery. b. The obturator nerve, formed generally from the second and third lumbar nerves, passes with the artery and vein of the same name through the foramen of the thyroid membrane. 7- There are five pairs of Sacral Nerves. Their gangli- form swelling is within the osseous canal of the sacrum. Their anterior and posterior branches emerge by the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. They communi- cate with the last lumbar, with each other, and, with the exception of the last, with the sacral ganglia. 8. The Sciatic Nerve is formed bv principal branches of the fourth and fifth lumbar, the first, second, and third sacral nerves. It passes from the pelvis by the sciatic notch between the pyriformis and geniini muscles. Be- low the middle of the thigh it is called the Popliteal nerve. 9* The popliteal nerve divides into two principal branches, the tibial and peroneal nerves. The former ends in the internal and external plantar nerves. The Ganglia. The ganglia are small bodies, redish or greyish, situated most generally along the sides of the vertebral column, in the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Their shape is very varia- ble—round, or lenticular, or triangular. They consist of a pulpy nervous substance, whose peculiar nature is unknown, enclosed in a sheath of condensed cellular substance. Ex- ternally the whole ganglion is surrounded by abundant cellular membrane of a loose texture.56 The nerves which proceed from a ganglion are of two kinds: branches which communicate with the cerebral nerves and ganglia above and below it: and others which are curiously interwoven with branches from neighbouring gan- glia forming a network of nervous filaments, with gangliform swellings, called plexus. The first set is whitish, and resembles the cerebral nerves, the other is greyish or redish. The nerves of the plexus always surround the arteries, and are distributed along with them and their subdivisions to the organs for which they are destined. Nerves of the Ganglia. 1. The Ophthalmic Ganglia is, according to Bich&f, the only true ganglion which belongs to the head. It is situated at the bottom of the orbit, on the inside of the optic nerve. It sends branches to the nose—to the motor oculorum, and sends otf the celiary nerves. 2. The Cervical Ganglia are usually three in number. The first has an oblong form,—it is deep seated about the third or fourth vertebra of the neck. Its size is varia- ble. The middle cervical ganglion, round or lenticular, is generally found between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. The inferior cervical ganglion is very irregu- lar in form : it is situated above the neck of the first rib. a. The superior cervical ganglion—sends branches upwards to the carotid canal to join the motor oculorum, and Vidian branch of the superior maxillary. Internally, it gives off branches to join the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and to be distributed to the larynx, communicating with others from the laryngeal and recurrent nerves. Externally, branches to communicate with the anterior branches of the cervical nerves.W mAnteriorly, branches to join the facial, vagus, and hypo- glossal nerves,—a plexus which surrounds the carotid ar- tery and its branches,—branches which unite to form the superior cardiac nerves. b. The middle cervical ganglion sends branches upwards to communicate with the superior ganglion. Downwards, a plexus which surrounds the subclavian artery, and branches which terminate in the inferior ganglion. Outwards, a branch to the sixth cervical nerve. Internally, a plexus which surrounds the thyroid artery, and communicates with the recurrent nerve. Anteriorly, branches which form the middle cardiac nerve. c. The inferior cervical ganglion, sends a branch upwards to communicate with the middle ganglion. Outwards, branches which anastomose with the cervical nerves. Downwards, a plexus to the subclavian, and a branch to communicate with the first dorsal ganglion. Inwards, filaments to communicate with the recurrent and vagus. Forwards, the inferior cardiac nerves. « Cardiac Plexus. The three cardiac nerves of the right side, and those of the left (often only two in number) hav- ing communicated with the vagi and recurrents unite to form a plexus. The cardiac plexus is situated behind the aorta and in front of the pulmonary plexus, to which it sends many filaments : its principal branches accompany the subdivisions of the coronary arteries. Pulmonary plexus, formed by nerves from the inferior cer- vical ganglion, the vagi and recurrent nerves. 3. The thoracic ganglia are generally twelve in number, and are situated in the heads of the corresponding ribs. By their superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, and with the inferior cervical and first dorsal ganglia.58 I heir external branches communicate with the anterior branches of the dorsal nerves. The internal supply the parts in their neighbourhood and give rise to the splanchnic nerves, which are the origin of all the abdominal plexus. 4. Great splanchnic Neri'e. Formed by four or five branches from the sixth or seventh to the ninth or tenth ganglion. Passes the crura of the diaphragm between their branches, forms with the nerve of the opposite side, and assisted by nerves from the dorsal ganglia, the great solar plexus, which is situated upon the aorta in front of the vertebral column and behind the stomach. o. The solar Plexus distributes its subdivisions to the aorta. By its branches, in this way, are formed, the diaphrag- matic plexus, the cccliac, the superior and inferior mesen- teric, the renal plexus. 6. The lesser splanchnic Nerve—origin by two branches from the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia. Joins the nerve of the opposite side about the level of the twelfth rib—penetrates into the abdomen, and divides into two branches : one joins the great splanchnic nerve, the other the renal plexus. 7. The abdominal ganglia, are situated on the sides of the vertebrae between the twelfth rib and the sacrum. By superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, with the last thoracic and first sacral ganglion. Externally, with the anterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Internally, they assist in forming all the plexus in their neighbourhood. 8. The sacral ganglia are variable in number—generally three. By their superior and inferior branches they communicate with each other, and with the last abdominal ganglion.59 Externally they communicate with the sacral nerves. Anteriorly, they assist in forming the hypogastric plexus. Internally, branches unite with those of the opposite side forming a species of plexus. The mutual connection of all the ganglia by means of superior and inferior branches forms a continuous nervous chain, which has been very generally called the great sympa- thetic nerve. The Glandular System. Glands are organs formed of a congeries of blood-vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and excretory ducts, which are com- pacted by cellulqr tissue. They differ in texture, shape, magnitude, and proportion of their constituents according to their uses.* They have no where a fibrous structure : are readily rup- tured in any direction, and the ruptured surface is uneven. The resistance which they afford is almost entirely due to the cellular membrane which enters into their composition. The glandular substance, or parenchi/me, in some glands presents small distinct masses or lobes which are united by loose cellular membrane ; such masses are again composed of smaller lobules similarly united, and these again of still less, called acini. This is the structure of the lachrymal and salivary glands, and of the pancreas. • In others there is no appearance of lobes, or lobules, but the acini alone are uniformly and closely united, by delicate cellular membrane. This is the structure of the liver and kidney. J In others not even the acini are visible, the whole mass * True glands, or those which have an excretory duct, and se- parate a fluid from the blood, have been called conglobate glands, to distinguish them from the amglomenUt masses of the lymphatics, improperly called glands.60 of the gland being soft and pulpy.—These have much cellu- lar tissue, yield readily and thus resist rupture. This is the structure of the prostate, tonsils, and all mucous glands. Vid. Bichat, Vol. II. 602. The parenchyme in some glands is included in cellular membrane alone ; in others in a peculiar membrane : others have a serous covering externally. Each acinus receives an ultimate branch of an artery. This communicates, in a manner unknown, with the capillary origins of the veins and of the excretory ducts. The nerves of glands are sometimes derived exclusively from the cerebral nerveS—as in the lachrymal and salivary glands, and the amygdalae; or equally from the cerebral nerves and those of the ganglia, as in the testicle, liver, &c.; or exclusively from the ganglia as in the kidney and most of the mucous glands. The ducts are tubes having an internal mucous coat, which is a production from the mucous membrane of the surface on which they open, and an external covering which differs in different glands. They are abundantly provided with vessels and nerves. —0— The Organs ok Sense. 1. The Skin is the organ of touch. It forms moreover the general covering of the body,—and an excretory organ of great importance. 2. The skin consists of three substances \ the corium or true skin is internal :—externally is the epidermis: be- tween the two is the rete mucosum. 3. The Corium, is remarkable externally for the small de- pressions or furrows which it presents. These differ in magnitude in different parts of the body : they are largest in the palms of the hands and joints of the fingers.61 A peculiar fibrous substance interwoven in all directions essentially composes the skin.—The fibres are most closely arranged on the outer surface,—on the inner, they leave in most parts of the body areolar spaces which are tilled with fat. These areola? are not found in the fore- head, back of the hand, scrotum, &c., in such parts the inner surface of the corium is smooth. Blood vessels, absorbents, and nerves abound in the corium : the external surface is by far the most vascular. This portion of the skin possesses great elasticity and contractility: on boiling in water it may be entirely dis- solved—the liquor is found to contain gelatine. The Papilla are small eminences on the external sur- face of the corium, which in certain situations, as the extremities of the fingers, and toes, and palms of the hands, are regularly arranged, and present the striated appearance observable in those parts. They are highly sensible and peculiarly constitute the organ of touch. It is probable that many nervous filaments terminate on these eminences, though there be no direct proof of this. Sebaceous Follicles. These are numerous small cells which occupy the substance of the corium, and coin- inunicate by narrow ducts with the external air. The. corium is perforated bv canals for the passage of the hairs, whose direction is oblique to its surface. 4. The Epidermis is a thin, transparent, colourless mem- brane—less elastic than the true skin, closely adhering to it—and following exactly all its folds and inequalities. It has nearly the same thickness throughout,—except in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. B hen removed from the corium no pores are percep- tible in the epidermis,—but there is no doubt of their existence : neither can the perforations for the hairs and the ducts of the sebaceous glands be seen, even with a microscope, which certainly exist.62 It is entirely unorganised and resists putrefaction. 5. The rete mucosum adheres indifferently to the corium and epidermis.—Its nature is not well ascertained: by some it is supposed to be an unorganised membrane. Bichat gives the name of corps reticulaire to this substance, considering it as a congeries of the capillary vessels on the external surface of the corium. Others consider it as a mucous secretion from those vessels. It is very visible in the negro. Upon it the colour of the skin depends. 6. The nails are unorganised substances, similar in many respects to the epidermis: of lamellated appearance. The external lamellae is continuous throughout the whole convex surface of the nail, the more internal lamella* extend gradually less and less towards the posterior mar- gin, so that the nail is thickest anteriorly. Mode of connection with the integuments.—The epidermis of the upper surface of the fingers or toes, leaving the true skin projects a little beyond its margin, and is reflected for a short space on its inner surface. With this reflected portion of the epidermis the substance of the nail is conti- nuous by its posterior margin, in such a way that the lower concave surface of the nail may he considered as the epidermis of the subjacent portion of the finger or toe: near the end of the nail the epidermis leaves it to be continued over the extremity of the joint, and a free margin of the nail projects. 7. Hair. The form and quantity of the hair is very different in different parts of the body. The structure of a hair is the same in all. It consists of a cylindrical or oval bulb, and a body which tapers gradually. The bulb is situated in the subcutaneous adipose or cellular substance, and is contained in a sac, which on the surface of the skin is lost in the epidermis. It ad- heres to this sac, probably by means of its nutrient ves- sels. The bodv of the hair consists of two substances.The external is a sheath which possesses all the proper- ties of epidermis; the internal, at the root, at least, is a peculiar pulp. The nature of the internal substance is unknown ; it is supposed to be of a vascular nature, the vessels containing the nutrient and colouring sub- stances of the hair. On the thickness of the external coat, the varieties of hair in different parts of the body depend. The chemical analysis of Vauquelin shews that hair contains a quantity of animal matter, resembling mucus, and oily products which contain the colouring principle. The residium after burning hair, (about fifteen parts in a thousand) contains iron, oxide of manganese, phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, silica, and alumina. Black hair contains most iron and manganese : in white hair phosphate of magnesia is found, which is wanting in the other varieties. Nicholson's Journal, Vol. XV. p. 141. The skin is continued inwards by all the apertures of the body, and devolves into the mucous system. Of the Mucous System. Mucous membrane lines the interior of all those cavities which communicate with the air externally. Hence there are two great divisions of this system in the body. The one belongs to the organs concerned in respiration and digestion, the other to the urinary and genital organs. Mucous membrane is connected to all the surfaces which it lines by a cellular tissue which is not liable to be distended by fat, or serous fluid. In this way it is most generally united to a muscular layer. Its other surface is free, and presents many loose folds or duplicatures. Of these many are the effect of organisation, and are not obliterated when the64 membrane is distended : others are accidental. The former occur principally in the small intestines. There is a strong analogy between mucous membrane and skin. I he former has a corium and epidermis which are continuous with the corresponding components of skin. But the rete mucosum is wanting. Mucous membrane is however much more soft and pulpy than skin. It has also a much greater variety of consistency and thickness. The corium appears to have the general structure of true skin : blood vessels abound in it even more largely—particu- larly on its cuticular surface. Papilla and Villi, are largely disposed over the whole of this surface,—they are very different in magnitude in different regions : large and oblong in the tongue, stomach, and small intestines : smaller and Hatter in the large intestines, the gall bladder, and in excretory ducts. Mucous glands and follicles, are abundant throughout this texture, they are situated either below the corium or in its substance, and open on the interior of the cavity which is invested, by a duct.—Mucous glands are generally round and have no proper membrane, but are surrounded by cellular tissue. They are very vascular. Mucus is the Huid secreted by these glands.—It does not mix readily with water,—has a great affinity for oxygen, which it readily absorbs from the air, and becomes more thick and viscous during the process. It contains soda and mu- riate of soda, with phosphate of lime. It is probable that the secretion from the glands in different portions of this system differs in quality. The epidermis as it recedes from the skin of the external parts becomes gradually thinner and thinner, and is at length lost. It soon becomes of such tenuity in the human subject that it is difficult to ascertain its exact termination. It is probable that the portion which enters the mouth does not extend beyond the cardiac orifice of the stomach. Its absence is supplied by the adhesive mucous secretion.—65 The Organ of Taste. I. The Tongue is the principal organ of taste. Many parts situated in the same cavity, the mouth, are accessory to the due performance of its function. o. The boundaries of the mouth are, the lips and cheeks, in front and on the sides—the palate above, the velum palati and its pillars behind, and the tongue below. 3. The lips and cheeks consist of skin, muscular strata, and internal mucous membrane, with cellular membrane and fat which varies much in quantity. The soft palate and velum pendulum palati are a pro- duction from the posterior edge of the palate bones, formed of a double layer of mucous membrane, continu- ous from the palatine and nasal surfaces of those bones, with intervening muscles. On the middle of the edge where the two layers unite is an elongated portion called the uvula. The muscular stratum of the palate consists of the azygos uvulae in the middle, and the levatores palati on . the sides.—The anterior pillar is formed by the constric- tor isthmifaucium, the posterior by the palato-pharyngeus. Between the pillars are the mucous glands called amygdalae. 4. The mucous membrane which lines the cheeks, and base of the tongue, is perforated by the ducts of the salivary glands. These are the two parotids, the two submax- illary, the two sublingual glands. The Parotid Gland, occupies the space between the meatus auditorius externus, mastoid process, condyle and angle of the lower jaw, extends upon the masseter mus- cle, and in that situation has two projecting cornua. Its lobes are large, the connecting cellular tissue dense : the external coat condensed cellular membrane. The ducts form a single excretory tube which passes across the Fl66 middle of the masseter and perforates the buccinator and mucous membrane of the mouth opposite the third molar tooth. The Submaxillan/ Glands lie on the inner surface of the lower jaw near its angles, covered by the disgastricus and mylo-hyoidcus muscles on each side. They are softer than the parotids:—of similar formation. Each opens into the mouth by a single duct, on a papilla near the froenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Glands lie under the tongue on the mylo-hyoidei muscles, they open by single ducts near the orifice of the last-named. Often the submaxillary and sublingual glands have a com- mon duct: sometimes the ducts are numerous. The Saliva is tasteless, inodorous, of specific gravity a little greater than that of water. It is slightly viscous, becomes frothy on the admixture of air. It has a strong attraction for oxygen. It consists principally of water, with a little albumen, soda, muriate of soda, and phos- • phate of lime. 5. The tongue is an organ almost entirely composed of muscles, with intermediate cellular substance. These are connected to a bone called the os hyoides—and are covered by mucous membrane, a production of that which invests the mouth. The os hyoides. Its body, greater and lesser cornua. It is connected by its lesser cornua to the styloid process of the tem- poral bone, by the ligamentum stylo-hyoideum. The general shape of the tongue: the foramen ca>cum— the median line, the mucous glands at the base of the tongue are disposed in a right line on each side; these meet in the median line at an acute angle. /The linguales muscles constitute the principal mass of the tongue : the stylo-glossi, hyo-glossi, and genio-glossi assist. The mucous covering presents three different orders of emi- nences, the posterior are the largest, and are the mucous \(>? -lands which have been mentioned, the papilla conicir. llie second are tubercular and are situated in a plane in front ol the former, the papilla fungifonnes. The papilla villosa abound near the apex of the tongue, are very sensible, and are supposed to constitute the. immediate organ of taste. On the lower surface of the tongue is the frenvm, a fold of the mucous membrane, in the median plane. * Behind, the tongue is connected to the epiglottis by folds of tnucous membrane, which have been called the ligaments of the epiglottis. Arteries. The lingual arteries are branches of the external carotids, on the inferior surface they are called raninal. The veins open into the external jugulars, sometimes into the internal. Nerves, derived from the inferior maxillary, the glosso- plmryngei and liypo-glossi.—The two first give their filaments to the lesser papilla* :—the other to the muscles. —0— The Organ of Smf.lj.. 1. The nose, divided by its septum into two distinct cavities, together with certain sinus’, constitutes the organ of smell. 2. The external nose, is formed by cartilaginous produc- tions from the ossa nasi:—a single cartilage forms the dorsum and upper part of the nose—from its inner surface it sends a process to assist the vomer in com- pleting the septum. Two fibro-cartilages form the lower portion of the sides, and the ala?. The septum consists of the nasal lamella of the ethmoid, the vomer and the quadrilateral process from the nasal cartilage.—The car- tilages are united by ligaments. 3. The cavity of each nostril. The direction slightly oblique from before backward. The nostrils; their pos- terior communication with the fauces. The three mea- tus of each nostril:—the superior and middle formed by the convolutions of the ethmoid bone, the inferior meatus by the turbinated bone. E 268 4. 1 he sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal cells open into the superior meatus; the anterior ethmoidal cells, (which communicate with the frontal sinus’,) and the maxillary sinus open into the middle meatus ; the lacrymal duct opens into the inferior meatus. 5. All the nasal cavities are covered with a mucous mem- brane called the Pituitary or Schneiderian membrane : differing in texture in the different parts of the cavity. Towards the orifice of the nostril, the mucous membrane much resembles skin, abounding in sebaceous follicles and hairs : on the septum and meatus, it is pulpy, highly vas- cular and sensible, and abounding in mucous glands : in the sinus’ it is more delicate, its colour less red. 6. The olfactory nerve, dividing into numerous filaments, pierces the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone, and is distributed to the mucous membrane lining the supe- rior and middle meatus alone. It is supposed that the sense of smell is conveyed by this nerve. The trigemini send many branches to the nose. The nasal branch of the ophthalmic, after communicating with the ciliary nerves, returns into the cranium by the foramen ethmoideum, and penetrates the ethmoid bone with the branches of the olfactory nerve. The superior maxillary sends, through the spheno-palatine foramen, the superior, anterior and posterior nasal nerves to the ethmoid cells and posterior part of the septum. The palatine branch supplies the inferior meatus : the alveolar the maxillary sinus. 7. The arteries of the nose are from the internal maxillary, and ophthalmic arteries. —0 — The Organ of Sight. 1. The eye is contained in a pyramidal cavity, called the orbit, which is composed of seven bones of the cranium ; covered by periosteum, and filled, at the bottom, with69 cellular membrane and loose fat, in which the vessels and nerves pass to the globe of the eye. 2. The palpebree, or eye-lids, bound the orbit in front. They begin from the ei/e-brows. The upper eye-lid is the larger of the two, extending, when the eye is closed, considerably below its transverse diameter. The free edge of each eye-lid is terminated by a fibro-cartilage, called the tarsus. From the tarsi project the cilia, or eye-lashes. Structure. Skin of much tenuity is separated by a delicate and loose cellular tissue, never containing fat, from the mus- cular layer composed of the fibres of the orbicularis palpe- brarum. The tarsi begin at the inner canthus, or angle, from the tendon of that muscle, and are continuous with each other at the external angle bv means of fibres which proceed from each. Each tarsus is bevelled on its inner edge in such a way that a channel is formed when the two are in juxta position. Beneath the muscular layer the eye-lids, particularly at the outer angle, are strengthened by fibrous threads which proceed from the tarsi. The upper eye-lid, in addition to these, has the expanded tendon of the levator palpebrae inserted into the tarsus and outer angle. Below all, is the mucous membrane, continuous with the skin of the eye-lids, called the conjunc- tiva. Reflected from their inner surface, it covers the ante- rior third of the globe of the eye : at the inner angle it presents a fold called caruncula tacrtmalis, and enters the puncta lacrymalia. Below the conjunctiva and behind each tarsus are the mucous glands, called Meibomian glands. 3. The lacrt/inal organs. The lacrymal gland is suspended by a peculiar ligament in its fossa of the frontal bone:— its lobules and acini are supplied with arteries and nerves from the ophthalmic. It has six or eight excre- tory ducts which open on the inner surface of the upper eye-lid towards the outer angle. The puncta lacrymalia, project near the inner extremity of each tarsus. From them proceeds the lacrymal canal of70 VJl each eye-lid, separated by the caruncula :—near the nose they unite to form a common duct, which is soon dilated into the lacrymal sac. The sac is half an inch in length, adheres to the osseous canal formed by the os lacrymale and frontal process of the maxillary bone, and opens by the nasal duct beneath the turbinated bone of the nose. It is composed of an internal mucous membrane, and an external fibrous coat, which is continuous with the tendon of the orbicularis muscle. 4- The globe of the eye. Its general figure is nearly spherical. The axis bears to the transverse diameter the ratio of eighteen to seventeen. It is formed of seg- ments of different spheres. The larger sphere composes the four posterior fifths, the smaller the anterior fifth. The axis of the eye is not coincident with that of the orbit. The two include an angle of about eight degrees. The axes of the two eyes are parallel. . The eye is formed of membranes and humours. The membranes are l.The sclerotica and cornea. 2. The choroid and iris. 3. The retina. The humours are 1. The vitreous humour. 2. The crystalline lens. 3. The aqueous humour. 1. The sclerotica is a dense fibrous membrane—continous lrom the dura mater of the optic nerve. It forms the posterior four fifths of the external covering of the globe.—It is strength- ened externally by the expanded tendons of the six muscles ol the eye. Behind, it presents an opening for the passage of the optic nerve, which is not in the axis of the globe, but more internal. In front, is the large opening, bevelled on its inner edge for the reception of the cornea. The shape oi the latter opening is somewhat elliptical, the transverse diameter being a little the larger. The cornea, on its convex surface is covered by the trans- parent conjunctiva; behind, it corresponds to the aqueous hu- mour. It is composed of lamina? which are united by cellular substance. They are separable by maceration, and between them a fluid is habitually secreted.The choroid cout, lines the inner surface of the sclerotica, and adheres to it by cellular threads, particularly at the junction of the sclerotica and cornea. It extends from the optic nerve to a projecting ring which it forms at the anterior edge of the sclerotica, called the ciliary circle. It is not continuous with the pia mater of the nerve. Its posterior opening for the passage of the optic nerve: its anterior opening, to which the ciliary processes and iris are connected. The nature of this membrane is unknown, it is highly vascu- lar and abundantly supplied with nerves. It secretes a dark coloured fluid on its inner surface, called pigmentum nigrum. The pigmentum nigrum is supposed by some anatomists to be a peculiar retiform membrane formed principally by con- volutions of the minute ciliary vessels, and not a secretion. Vid. /inn. Descr. Anat. Oculi Illimani, Tab. I. fig. 1. and Mondini. Opuscoli Scieuti/ici della Socictu Bolognese. Vol. II. The Ciliary circle, an annular swelling where the choroid terminates anteriorly. It is a congeries of the ciliary vessels and nerves united by cellular membrane. The Corpus Ciliare—a membranous ring, with posterior plica*, extending in a vertical plane from the ciliary circle to- wards the axis of the eye. Processus ciliares, the name given to these plica*. Soem- mering has counted fifty-seven of them, others seventy. They are abundantly covered by pigmentum nigrum, and rest by their posterior margins on the vitreous humour, and the canal which surrounds the crystalline lens. Distribution of the ciliary arteries. The ciliary veins form about twelve trunks, called vasa vorticosa, which return their contents partly by the cerebral ophthalmic vein into the cavernous sinus, and partly by the facial ophthalmic vein into the internal facial vein. The Iris is a circular ring which hangs from the anterior part of the ciliary circle in a vertical plane towards the axis of the eye, and divides the eye in front of the crystalline lens into two chambers. It is supposed to differ in nature from the choroid; it appears to be composed of the infinite convolutions72 of blood vessels and of the ciliary nerves—without any muscu- lar fibre. Its posterior surface has been called urea, and seems to be a production from the ciliary circle, and in brutes, of the nature of the choroid. In man, the iris and uvea form one membrane. J he colour of the iris is due to its vessels and to the pigmen- tum nigrum which smears it behind. Pupil. The lesser circumference, or opening of the iris, is called the pupil. 3. The Retina. The optic nerve, arriving at the bulb of the eye, quits its fibrous covering and divides into about thirty fila- ments which unfold in every direction to form the retina. The retina lines the inner surface of the choroid to within a sixth part of an inch of the ciliary processes. The central artery and vein of the retina, entering the centre of the optic nerve, send some small vessels to the retina and then pierce the vitreous body. In the centre of the retina about the fifth of an inch on the outside of the entrance of the optic nerve is the foramen cen- trale surrounded by the limbus luteus. Neither are observ- able in subjects under two years old. The humours of the eye. 1. The vitreous humour, convex at its posterior part, and a little concave in front, colourless and entirely transparent, occupies the greater portion of the globe—extending from the retina to the crystalline lens. It consists of a delicate membrane called the hyaloid membrane, which adheres to the retina by means of the central artery which pierces it behind ; and in front to the capsule of the lens and the ciliary processes. This mem- brane containing the humour divides in front into two lamina?; of which one, called the ciliary zone, adheres to the fore part of the capsule of the lens and the ciliary processes : the other adheres to the posterior part of this capsule. Where the two divide a circular space is left surrounding the capsule, called the canal of Petit. The hyaloid also penetrates the substance of the vitreous73 humour, and forms many cells, diminishing in magnitude towards its centre : these communicate. The fluid of the vitreous humour has a specific gravity 1.0053 and contains a small quantity of albumen and muriate of soda. 2. The Crystalline Lens. Is received into the concave anterior surface of the vitreous humour. Its capsule adheres to the hyaloid in the way which has been described, and within it the lens floats loosely. It is doubly convex. Its axis cor- responds to the axis of the eye, and is half the breadth of the lens. In an adult the axis of the lens is about one fifth of an inch. Its specific gravity is to that of water as 3 : 2. Its density increases towards the center. It contains much albumen. The substance of the lens is very soft externally,— it becomes much harder towards its nucleus. When put into boiling water, or dilute nitric acid, it separates into eight tri- angular segments, each of which is composed of delicate con- centric lamina1. It is said that two thousand, at least, of such lamina exist—they are connected bv oblique fibres; and in the interstices of the whole a fluid is contained probably similar to that of Morgagni. The posterior surface of the lens is the more convex. The capsule differs from the hyaloid in nature: it contains much more albumen, becoming opaque when treated with alcohol and acids. The lens floats freely within the capsule in the midst of a clear fluid called the humour of Morgagni, derived from the exhalants of the capsule. The vessels of the capsule are from the central artery of the retina : nerves have not been discovered. 3. The aqueous humour is a fluid which occupies the two cham- bers of the eye between the lens and the cornea. The two chambers together have an axis rather exceeding that of the lens. 1 his fluid is in all respects similar to that of the vitreous humour. It is secreted hy the exhalant arteries o! the neighbouring parts, as the ciliary.I he ophthalmic artery supplies the eye. The optic nerve is subservient to vision. The motores oculorum, pathetici and abducentes supply the muscles.—The orbital branch of the ophthalmic nerve supplies the lacrymal gland, and sends filaments to assist the other nerves. The ciliary nerves are derived from the ophthalmic ganglion. The Organ of Hearing. 1. The ear consists of three distinct divisions, 1. The ex- ternal ear, or pinna, with the meatus auditorius externus. 2. The cavity of the tympanum, with the mastoid cells and Eustachian tube. 3. The internal ear, or labyrinth. 0. The external ear. Its projections are, from above down- wards; the helix : the antihelix (between the two supe- rior portions of which is the fossa navicularis): the tragus which projects over the meatus from before : the anti- tragus. In the midst of these eminences is the concha which terminates in the meatus. Below it is the lobule of the ear. #» Structure. The skin abounds in sebaceous follicles both in front of, and behind, the pinna. It presents hairs only on the internal surface of the tragus. The lobule is composed entirely of skin and compact adipose membrane. Fibro-cartilage, nearly of the shape of the ear is below the skin.—Its interrupted portions are connected by ligaments. Small muscles, inconstant in their appearance, effect slight alterations of shape in the pinna. These are, 1. Tragicus. 2. Antitragicus. 3. Helicis major. 4. Helicis minor. 5. Transversalis. The pinna is fixed to the head by three ligaments inserted into the convex surface of the concha. The arteries are from the external carotid. The nerves are from the facial, the inferior maxillary, the third cervical.'*<• *-• p ;*£_ jL*A j(l * *4 2*'/ As€.lA Jfc-f /A. £*9 1*'..^ y* h*v &r<.. i*h*.i ? & +**+^j£*9« fau*>A ^ ik. Jr ik~ h-^A75 3. The meatus auditorius externus—extends from the con- vexity of the concha to the membrana tympani. Its lengtli in the adult is about an inch, its diameter a quarter of an inch: its direction arched. Structure. The osseus meatus of the temporal bone is assisted at its lower part by a triangular lamina of tibro-car- tilage produced from the pinna, at its upper and lateral parts by fibrous membrane which connects the sides of this lamina. The inner membrane is a production from the skin of th6 ear. It is continued over the outer surface of the tympanum. In the cellular substance beneath the inner membrane are the ceruminous glands. The properties of cerumen. By chemical analysis it consists of albumen, an inspissated oil, a colouring matter, soda and phosphate of lime. 4. The membrana tympani. Its direction oblique down- wards and inwards. It is composed of three membranes : the proper membrana tympani being invested externally by the lining of the meatus, internally by that of the tympanum. 5. The cavity of the tympanum. Its situation at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where it is joined by the two other portions. Its general cavity is hemispherical. It is lined with mucous membrane continuous with that of the mouth through the Eustachian tube, its only opening externally. At the bottom of the tympanum the promontory is the eminence which separates the fenestra ovalis from the fenestra rotunda. The fenestra ovalis, covered by the base of the stapes is above it: below and behind it is the fenestra rotunda which is closed by mucous membrane. The pyramid is an eminence behind the fenestra ovalis, hollowed for the reception of the stapedius muscle. Behind, and near the membrana tympani, is the opening by which the chorda tympani penetrates from the aqueduct of Fallopius. A little higher than the fenestra rotunda, and behind it, is the opening of the mastoid cells.76 Below is the glenoid fissure for the passage of the externus mallei and chorda tympani. The Eustachian tube, nearly two inches in length esta- blishes a communication between the cavity of the tympanum and that of the fauces. One-third of this tube nearest to the ear is osseus, the rest cartilaginous. It begins in front of the promontory, and proceeds forwards and inwards towards the posterior and superior part of the nasal opening. It is lined by a delicate production of the mucous membrane of the fauces. 6. The small bones of the ear are four in number : malleus, incus, os orbiculare, .stapes. They are connected by ligaments so as to form an osseus chain extending across the cavity of the tympanum, from the membrana to the fenestra ovalis. 1. The malleus presents a head, neck, and two processes of which the longer is called the handle. The malleus adheres by the head and handle to the membrana tympani, forming a radius of its circle. 2. The incus : its body connected with the head of the malleus : its two processes, of which the larger is joined to the os orbiculare. 3. The stapes, affixed by its base to the fenestra ovalis. Its two crura unite to form the head which is connected to the os orbiculare. 7. The muscles which move the small bones of the ear, and thus stretch or relax the membrana tympani are four. 8. The labyrinth is the inner and most essential portion of the ear. Its numerous parts are invested by a vascular membrane on which the auditory nerve is expanded. It consists of three subdivisions, the vestibule, semicircular ca?ials, and cochlea. 1. Laxator tympani. 2. Interims mallei. 3. Externus mallei. 4. Stapedius.1. The Vestibule is tlie central part of tire labyrinth, with which the two others communicate. It presents, the opening of the fenestra ovalis, covered by the base of the stapes: beneath this the opening of that portion of the cochlea called scala vestibuli and of the aqueduct of the vestibule : the five openings of the semicircular canals. 2. The semicircular canals are three in number. Of these, two are vertical and one horizontal. The two vertical have only three openings into the vestibule, one being common to a branch of each of these canals. The horizontal has two openings. 3. The cochlea. Its situation oblique, in front of the vestibule. Its base is placed inwards and backwards towards the meatus internus : its apex forwards, outwards and a little downwards. A hollow cone constituting the central pillar of the cochlea is called the modiolus : round it is a spiral cavity consisting of two and a half convolutions. But the modiolus and spiral do not terminate together. The modiolus ends with the second convolution, and the cavity is continued for half a convolution more. The hollow in the modiolus is the principal entrance for the filaments of the auditory nerve, to the inner ear. It is pierced throughout by numerous pores, through which filaments of the nerve are distributed to the spiral canal. At the apex of the modiolus the cavity is dilated into the infundibulum. The spiral cavity is divided in the direction of its length into two distinct portions, by a lamina composed of bone and membrane. These two portions communicate only ui the infundibulum. One of them is called the scala timpani, and corresponds at its base to the fenestra rotunda; the other the scala vestibuli, and opens by its base into the vestibule. These divisions of the cochlea are lined with a membrane, which receives vessels and nerves, and secretes as in the other parts of the labyrinth, a fluid called liquor Cotunmi. The aqueduct of the cochlea has its opening in the scala tympani, near the fenestra rotunda. The two aqueducts, of the vestibule and of the cochlea, open externally into veins of the dura mater.78 f). The vessels and nerves of the ear. Arteries. The meatus externus derives its arteries from the pos- terior auricular, and temporal. The cavity and small bones of the tympanum from the posterior auricular, internal maxil- lary, and meningeal. The labyrinth from the basilar artery. Nerves. The auditory nerve entering the meatus internus, pene- trates in two portions the vestibule and the cochlea. The facial nerve, in its passage through the aqueduct of Fal- lopius, having received a filament from the Vidian nerve, sends to the membrana tympani the nerve called chorda tympani, and filaments to the muscles of the small bones. —0— t The Organ of the Voice. 1. The larynx essentially constitutes the organ of the voice. It consists of cartilages, membranes, ligaments, and muscles. It is connected to the os hyoides, and commu- nicates with the cavity of the fauces above ; below it is • continuous with the trachea. 2. The cartilages of the larynx are four in number: the thyroid, the cricoid, the two arytenoid cartilages. Their relative situations and connections described. The fibro- cartilage of the larynx, the epiglottis : its connection with the tongue, the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage. 3. These several parts arc connected by ligaments and muscles : and are lined on their inner surface, by a thick and soft mucous membrane amply provided with glands, which is continued from that of the fauces. 4. The Glottis, or Rima Glottidis, described : the superior and inferior ligaments of the glottis, or thyro-arytenoid. Between each pair of ligaments, on the sides, are the ventricles of the larynx. Muscles of the larynx and os hyoides. Vide page 16. 5.$u*f~v- •' J« '*-«SPTI79 0. The blood-vessels of the larynx are from the superior and inferior thyroid. 7. The nerves are from the par vagum, viz. the external and internal laryngeal with filaments from the glosso-pharyn- geal, and the recurrent with filaments, from the cardiac plexus. —0— 8. Description of the thyroid gland. —0— The Organs of Respiration. 1. The lungs, the respiratory organs, are contained in the cavity of the thorax. 2. Description of the cavity of the thorax in the recent subject. The mode in which the serous membrane (Pleura Costalis) invests the inner surface of the thorax —is reflected upon the surface of each lung (Pleura Pulmonalis), and in its course constitutes two principal cavities, one for each lung, which do not communicate. Spaces arc left between these circumscribed cavities at their anterior and posterior parts. The anterior space extends in an oblique direction from right to left beneath the sternum, and is called the anterior Mediastinum. The posterior is parallel to the vertebral column, and is called the posterior Mediastinum. The anterior Mediastinum contains—in its upper portion, the subclavian Veins and Vena Cava Superior, the arch of the aorta and trunks which spring from it, the remains of the Thymus gland and some absorbent glands: in its lower por- tion, the Pericardium and Heart. The posterior Mediastinum contains, the. pulmonary7 ves- sels, the end of the trachea, and commencement of the bronchi, the greatest part of the (Esophagus, the descending Aorta, Par Vagum, Vena Azygos, Thoracic duct, many absorbent glands.80 3. The shape ot the Lungs. The division of each) by a con-* siderable fissure which descends obliquely from behind forwards, into two portions. The further division, ordi- narily, of the superior portion of the right lung into two. So that the left lung consists of two lobes, the right usually of three. 4. The substance of the lungs consists of the subdivisions of the air-tubes, of the subdivisions of the pulmonary artery , and of the pulmonary veins, of the proper tissue which serves as a medium of communication between these different orders of vessels, together with nutrient vessels, absorbents, and nerves—and an investing serous membrane. The Air-Tubes. The Trachea, continuous with the Larynx, divides about the second or third dorsal vertebra into the two Bronchi, one for each lung. The subdivi- sions of the bronchi. Structure. The Trachea consists externally of a mem- brane composed of longitudinal fibres, which is continuous throughout the whole length of the trachea behind. This membrane on its fore-part is continually' interrupted by trans- verse cartilages, representing two-thirds of the circumference of a circle, into whose margins and outer surfaces it is in- serted. It gradually becomes thinner in the subdivisions of tbe bronchi. The cartilages are variable in number in the trachea : the first, which is the largest adheres to the cricoid : the last has a peculiar shape suited to the reception of the superior cartilage of the bronchus on each side. In the bronchi the cartilages insensibly become irregular, and are at length lost. 1 he extreme branches of each cartilage are connected behind by transverse fibrous bands, which many anatomists consider to lie muscular. Vid. Haller. Vol. III. p. 146- The inner surface of the air-tubes is lined with mucous membrane continued from that of the larynx. It invests the most minute subdivisions of these tubes. Its colour is pale.81 and in the trachea it presents longitudinal plica*, and nume- rous orifices of excretory ducts belonging to the mucous glands which are situated in the cellular tissue exterior to the fibrous membrane. The epidermis of the mucous membrane of the air-tubes has not been demonstrated. The arteries of the trachea are from the thyroid, especially the inferior. The bronchial arteries are immediately from the aorta, and follow the subdivisions of the tubes. The nerves are supplied principally from the par vagum assisted by filaments from the pulmonary plexus. 6- The pulmonary artery. Its inner membrane similar to that of veins. Its fibrous membrane similar to that of the aorta. The subdivisions of the pulmonary artery accompany those of the bronchi. The two orders of vessels have no direct communication, but are united by cellular tissue alone. 7- The pulmonary veins. Their inner membrane possesses the properties of the corresponding membrane of arteries. The outer resembles the corresponding membranes of veins. The pulmonary veins have their origins in the capillary system of the lungs. The branches continually coalesce, and at length enter the left auricle of the heart by four principal trunks. It is in the capillary system of the lungs that the ultimate branches of the pulmonary artery and veins are intimately connected with those of the air-tubes. It is doubtful however whether there be free communication amongst them. Vid. Haller, Vol. III. p. 158—16'5. 8. The substance of the lungs, compounded of these subdivisions of different orders of vessels, is divisible into lobes. The lobes are composed of lobules united by cellular substance, and these again of others still smaller and smaller. The ultimate lobuli are considered to be distinct membranous cavities, or vesicles, on the surface of which the different orders of vessels commu- nicate bv means of their minute and numerous capillaries. F82 The Organs oi Digestion. 1. The digestive organs constitute a series of connected cavities :—with glandular appendages which communi- cate with them. The former series comprises the Pha- rynx, (Esophagus, Stomach, and Intestinal Canal : the latter the Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas. 2. The Pharynx is a membranous and muscular sac, con- nected above, to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. It is bounded below by the oesophagus, into which it opens on the level of the first rings of the trachea : in front, by the cavities of the mouth, nostrils, and larynx : behind, it rests upon the vertebral column. Structure. It consists of an external muscular coat, and an internal mucous membrane. lor the muscles the pharynx, Vid. p. l6. The mucous membrane is continuous from that of the mouth and nostrils. Its external surface is connected to the muscular layer by loose cellular tissue. It is more red than the corresponding membrane of the mouth and nostrils; presents no villi, but many projections which are the orifices of the mucous ducts. The Pharyngeal arteries are from the external carotid : The nerves from the Glosso-pharyngei, Par Vagum, and two upper Cervical Ganglia. 3. The (Esophagus is continuous w ith the lower portion of the Pharynx. It commences about the fourth or fifth Cervical Vertebra and terminates at the (Esophageal aperture of the Diaphragm. Its direction and connec- tions. Its great dilatability. Structure. An external muscular, and internal mucous coat The muscular coat consists of a transverse and of a longitudinal order of muscles. The mucous membrane is whiter than that of the pharynx, and presents many longitu- dinal folds, which are accidental and not dependant on struc- ture. It has a cuticular covering.SS Arteries at the upper part from the inferior Thyroid, and (Esophageal: near the Stomach, from the Diaphragmatic and Coronaria Ventriculi. Nerves: from the Vagi, Pulmonary and Cardiac Plexus, and Thoracic Ganglia, forming a plexus throughout its extent. The Stomach and intestinal Canal, with their append- ages, are contained in the cavity of the abdomen. 4. Cavity of the Abdomen. Formation of its parietes. Its arbitrary divisions into regions. In the middle, the Epi- gastric, Umbilical, and Hypogastric regions :—on each side, the Hypochondriac, Lumbar, and Iliac regions. The Peritoneum invests the interior of the abdominal parietes, and is reflected over all the viscera which they contain. It is a serous membrane, whose thickness is very variable in its different portions. Its free surface is perfectly smooth and lubricous : its adhering surface flocculent, and connected by cellular membrane. It presents a sac without any opening in the male. In the female the uterus communicates with the cavity of the abdomen by means of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes. Peritoneal folds. Supposing the peritoneum to consist of three portions, an umbilical, or middle portion, representing a circular band placed horizontally between the base of the chest and the crests of the ilia: an epigastric, or superior portion, a hypogastric, or inferior portion, each representing a segment of a spheroid continuous by the circumference ofits base, the one with the superior edge of the middle portion, tlie other with the inferior edge of the same: the course of the peritoneum may be traced as follows. The umbilical portion covers the posterior part of the linea alba, and the aponeurotic expansions behind the recti muscles. Passing from the umbilicus towards the inferior edge of the liver, and ensiform cartilage, it forms a triangular duplicature called Ligamentum latum Hepatis Suspensorium. Between F 081 its folds, this ligament contains on its posterior concave edge the umbilical vein: arriving at the liver it divides into two portions, of which the inferior dips into the horizontal fissure, accompanying the umbilical vein, the superior mounts be- tween the concave surface of the diaphragm and convex sur- face of the liver, dividing that viscus into two unequal lobes. —In its descent from the umbilicus, the peritoneum covers the posterior part of the urachus and umbilical arteries, thus forming three folds called Ligamcnta Vesica- Suspensoria. —Proceeding from the umbilicus towards the lumbar regions, this portion of peritoneum passes in front of the kidneys, fixes the ascending and descending colon to the posterior parietes of the abdomen by folds called the ascending and descending Mesocolon, covers the aorta and vena cava, is reflected on the sides of the mesenteric vessels, and terminates r by suiTounding the sides and convex edge of the jejunum and ilion, thus forming the Mesentery. The hypogastric portion of the peritoneum covers the upper part of the anterior surface of the bladder, its fundus, the greater part of its posterior surface and sides. In the male, arriving at the base of the vesiculae seminales, it is reflected upon the rectum, which it covers in front and on the sides, and forms in front of the sacrum the Meso-rectum, continuous at its upper extremity with the descending meso-colon. On the sides of the bladder and rectum it covers the sacral and hypo- gastric vessels, and passes into the iliac regions. The epigastric portion of the peritoneum—on the left side, covers a great part of the abdominal surface of the diaphragm: at the origin of the splenic vessels it is reflected upon their posterior surface, covers the posterior edge, convex surface, and anterior edge of the spleen. Arriving at the fissure in that organ, it passes in front of the splenic vessels, and arrives at the cardiac extremity of the stomach and omentum gastro- hepaticum. The laminae of peritoneum between the spleen and stomach form the Omentum gastro-splenicum. From the central part of the diaphragm the peritoneum descends in front of the oesophageal aperture, as far as the anterior surfaceof the stomach :—more to the right it forms the left lamina of the ligamentum hepatis suspensorium, arrives at the convex- surface of the liver, forms its left lateral ligament, descends upon the anterior surface of its middle lobe, and advances as far as the anterior edge of the transverse fissure. It is then reflected in front of the hepatic and coronaria ventriculi arteries as far as the anterior surface of the stomach, thus forming the anterior lamina of the Omentum gastro-hepaticum. It then covers the whole anterior, or superior, surface of the stomach, passes in front of the arterise gastro-epiploica;: descends to the inferior regions of the abdomen, and then is reflected up- wards, as far as the convex edge of the arch of the colon- This lamina thus assists in forming the great Omentum, after which it covers the inferior surface of the arch of the colon, leaves that intestine, and passes below the duodenum and pancreas to become continuous with the mesentery, having thus formed the inferior lamina of the transverse Meso-colon. In the right hypochondrium the peritoneum passes from the diaphragm to the liver forming the right lamina of the ligamentum suspen- sorium, and the right lateral ligament, covers the convex surface, the edge, the inferior surface of the great lobe, the gall-bladder, and regains the diaphragm to pass into the peritoneum of the right lumbar region. From the gall-bladder, the peritoneum sends a prolongation which is engaged in a triangular open- ing situated below the neck of the gall-bladder, and in front of the abdominal vena cava. This opening is called the foramen of IVinslov:. The prolongation extends first, behind the biliary and hepatic vessels, as far as the lesser curvature of the stomach, forming the inferior lamina of the omentum gastro-hepaticum: covers the posterior, or inferior surface of the stomach, passes behind the arterise gastro-epiploic®, as far down as the inferior edge of the great omentum, thus lining the whole of its anterior lamina: it is then reflected up- wards, lining the posterior lamina of the omentum as far as the convex edge of the arch of the colon, covers the superior surface of that intestine, and thus forms the superior lamina oi the transverse Meso-colon. passes above the duodenum andpancreas, and is spread upon the small lobe of the liver as far as the posterior edge of its transverse fissure. From this description it appears that the great omentum consists, at its inferior portion, of four laminae of peritoneum. In the female, the peritoneum passes from the posterior sur- face of the bladder to the uterus, which it entirely invests, and from the posterior surface of which it is reflected upon the rectum. The broad ligaments of the uterus are two tri- angular folds broader above than below, which extend from the superior angles and edges of the uterus into the iliac fossae. Their base presents three secondary folds : the anterior covers a vascular cord, called the round ligament of the uterus, which passes to the abdominal ring, the middle fold affords a covering to the Fallopian tube, the posterior covers the ovary and its ligament. Vid. Marjolin, Manuel d’ Anatomie. II. 36l—578. The Stomach. The oesophagus expands into the sto- mach. Its shape; its two curvatures, the lesser concave, the greater convex. The superior orifice the cardia, the inferior orifice the pylorus. Situation of the stomach : in the epigastric region, and left hypochondrium; it extends also into the right hypochondrium, where it terminates in the duodenum. Its largest transverse section is in the left hypochondrium, its smallest in the right. Its left extremity is connected by omentum to the spleen : the left lobe of the liver covers its right extremity. Behind it, are the pancreas, the renal capsules, the aorta: below it the transverse arch of the colon. The two orifices are nearly fixed : the great curvature possesses the greatest mobility. Structure. Besides a muscular and mucous coat, it has externally a serous covering from the peritoneum. The serous coat is very smooth and lubricous externally : its inner sur- face is connected to the muscular coat by cellular substance. In the neighbourhood of the two curvatures there is a space left where the serous coat is not connected to the muscular.87 Here the great vessels of the stomach are found.—The muscular coat is produced from that of the oesophagus, and is especially visible near the termination of that canal. The fibres follow three different directions. The external fibres are longitudinal, from the oesophagus, and extend from the cardia to the pylorus and duodenum: the next are obliquely transverse, the inner circular, both extending from one curvature to the other.—The internal mucous coat is a continuation of the mucous membrane of the oesophagus. It is abundantly supplied with exhalants, mucous crypta*, absorbents and nerves. The epidermis appears to terminate near the cardia. The villi. The gastric glands near the cardia. Numerous rugae are observable in the mucous coat, of which some depend upon structure, and others are due to the undistended state of the viscus. At tire cardia the circular fibres form a sort of ring called sphincter cardia:. At the pylorus the mucous membrane forms a circular thickening, or projection, called the valve oj the pylorus. Here also are circular muscular fibres. The cceliac trunk supplies the arteries of the stomach. The coronaria ventriculi sinistra is immediately from it. The hepatic artery gives off the coronaria dextra, and gastro-epiploica dextra, the splenic the gastro-epiploica sinis* tra. The veins belong to the portal system. The nerves form a network round the arteries: they are from the cceliac plexus and par vagum. Vid. Cuvier, III. 369- Sir E. Hume's Lectures, I. 143. C). The small intestines consist of three portions called Duodenum, Jejunum, llion. The length of the whole is about four times that of the body. The duodenum : its situation : its two flexures : the orifices of the common biliary duct, and of the pan- creatic duct. This portion passes into the jejunum when it has perforated the inferior lamina of the trans- verse meso-colon. Of the remainder of the small intes- tines the three superior fifths are called jejunum, the two inferior fifths ilion.88 Structure of the small intestines. There is a serous, a muscular, and a mucous coat in all. The serous coat allows of different degrees of mobility in the different portions of the canal.—The muscular coat consists of two strata of fibres : the external longitudinal, few in number: the external annu- lar, and decussatiug in different directions.—The mucous coat, thinner than that of the stomach, abounding in blood-vessels and absorbents and furnished with very numerous mucous glands, presents loose folds called valvulce conniientes. These project transversely from the circumference into the cavity of the intestine: are dependant upon structure, and conse- quently can not be obliterated by distending the caual. They begin about an inch from the pylorus. The Villi. The nerves of the small intestines are from the coeliac and mesenteric plexus. The arteries of the duodenum are from the hepatic and superior mesenteric: of the jejunum and ilion, from the superior mesenteric. The veins belong to the portal system : they have no valves. The absorbents of the small intestines, from the appear- ance of the fluid which they convey, are called lacteals. They abound in the duodenum, their number is diminished towards the lower part of the small intestine. They have the same structure as the other absorbents—pass through numerous glands between the folds of the mesentery, and at length terminate in the thoracic duct. 7. The large intestine consists of three portions, the Cecum, Colon, and Rectum. The caecum lies in the right iliac fossa: the colon rises from that fossa to the right hypochondriac region, passes transversely into the left hvpochondriac region, descends in the left lumbar re- gion, forms a double curve, or sigmoid flexure, in the left iliac fossa, and terminates in the rectum near the base of the sacrum. The rectum occupies the posterior part of the pelvis, and terminates in the Jnus. The length of the large intestine bears to that of the small the proportion of 1 : 5.// - - trT89 Structure of the Ceri um and Colon. Three coats, generally similar to those of the small intestines. The peritoneum gives origin to many fatty appendages, which abound more in the lumbar than in the transverse or iliac portions of the intestine. They are called appendices epiphicae. The lon- gitudinal fibres of the muscular coat are. collected into three bands, two anterior and one posterior. These bands are much shorter than the intestine itself, from which circum- stance it assumes a sacculated, or embossed, appearance. The mucous coat abounds with glands, the villi are not very apparent,—the valvula; conniventes wanting. The Appendix vermiformis of the caecum; the ileo-ccecal valve. Structure of the Rectum. The anterior and superior part is covered by peritoneum:—the inferior third has no serous covering, but corresponds, in man, to the posterior and infe- rior surface of the bladder, the vesicula? seminales, prostate, and membranous portion of the urethra. In the female, the lower portion, which is not covered by peritoneum, adheres immediately to the vagina. The posterior surface of the rec- tum throughout has no peritoneal covering.—The muscular coat is very strong, the longitudinal fibres surround the whole of the intestine:—the lower circular fibres form a muscular ring called sphincter internus. The arteries of the two upper portions of the large intestine are from the superior and inferior mesenteric:—the veins belong to the portal system: the nerves from the superior and inferior mesenteric plexus. The arteries of the rectum are the haemorrhoidales, interna, media1, and externa1, from the inferior mesenteric and hypo-gastric arteries. The inter- nal h.Tmorrhoidal vein belongs to the portal system :—the others to the hypo-gastric veins. The nerves of the rectum at the upper part are from the ganglia: at the lower part the muscles are supplied from the sacral nerves. 8. The Liver. Its magnitude : it occupies nearly the whole of the right hypochondriac, and part of the epigastric, region. Its connections and relations with the neigh- bouring parts. The weight of the liver varies from two90 lo five pounds. Its specific gravity is to that of water as 15.2 : 10. The superior convex surface of the liver is divided by the suspensory fold of peritoneum into two lobes unequal in size: the right, or large lobe, the left, or middle lobe. On the inferior concave surface are ; the horizontal fissure for the umbilical vein : the transverse fissure for the vena portae, the hepatic artery, the hepatic duct, with lymphatics and nerves, surrounded by the capsule of Glisson: the fissure of the vena cava : the small lobe, or, Lobulus Spigelii behind the transverse fissure : the gall-bladder and fossa in which it is con- tained. Structure. The external serous coat:—it is deficient where the liver adheres to the diaphragm : at the places of inser- tion of the suspensory and lateral ligaments: and at the bottom of the different fissures. Beneath the serous mem- brane is another, of much greater extent, which adheres to it: covers the whole external surface of the liver, and is produced into its substance : forming the cellular sheaths which accompany the subdivisions of the different vessels. The substance of the liver is composed of acini. These are supposed to consist of the minute terminations of the blood- vessels, and origins of the biliary tubes, connected by the delicate cellular membrane which has been mentioned. The blood-vessels are, the hepatic artery: the vena porta;: the hepatic veins. Between the ultimate branches of these different orders of vessels there appears to be direct anasto- mosis. The nerves are from the cacliac plexus. The biliary tubes, at length coalesce to form two or three trunks, which, emerging from the lobes of the liver, unite at an obtuse angle to form the hepatic duct. This duct proceeds in front, and to the right, of the hepatic artery, and below the vena ports : it receives the cystic duct, from the gall-bladder and the two form the ductus communis choledochus, which perforates the duodenum obliquely :— between the mus- cular and mucous coat of the intestine, it is joined by the pancreatic duct, and proceeding about an inch penetrates theJjh- fakddj** ' j c /*— 'M-v &C 't <ec—91 mucous coat. Sometimes the ductus eholedochus and the pancreatic duct, terminate in the intestine by distinct orifices. The Gall-bladder. Its shape: its situation: connection with the liver. Its structure : a partial serous covering, beneath this is a cellular membrane in which is disposed a network of blood-vessels and lymphatics : an internal mucous coat, continuous with that of the intestines through the ductus eholedochus. At the neck of the gall-bladder the folds of the mucous coat form a species of imperfect valve. The Cystic artery is a branch of the Hepatic: the vein belongs to the Portal system. The ducts consist of two membranes—an external cellular, and internal mucous membrane. Bile. Chemical analysis of Berzelius.

The salts are the muriate, sulphate and phosphate of soda, and phosphate of lime, oxide of iron. 9. The Spleen. Its situation in the left hvpochondrium. Its shape : its concave surface adapted to the cardiac extremity of the stomach. Its magnitude and specific gravity are very variable. Structure. External serous covering, deficient only at the bottom of the fissure on the concave surface. It is connected by its inner surface to the proper membrane of the spleen. This is of a fibrous nature. It sends many delicate produc- tions into the substance of the viscus, which accompany the splenic vessels throughout their extent, it is of a greyish white colour; its cellular filaments decussate in all directions in the substance of the spleen, giving it, when washed, a spongy appearance.92 The parenchyme of the spleen appears to consist of the subdivisions of blood-vessels, and the connecting cellular structure. The whitish nodules which are seen in its sub- stance are, according to Haller, fasciculi of these vessels. The splenic artery is from the Ca;liac trunk. The vein belongs to the Portal system. The absorbents assist to form the Thoracic duct. The nerves, from the caeliac plexus, accompany the arteries : in the substance of the viscus they become so small that they cannot be traced. Vid. Haller. Phys. Vol. VI. p. 409- 10. The Pancreas. It is deeply seated in the epigastric region : extending transversely between the laminae of the mesocolon, behind the stomach, between the spleen and duodenum. Structure. Similar to that of the salivary glands. It has no proper serous coat. Its acini are connected by cellular substance : these again are collected into lobuli, which com- pose the whole substance of this viscus. The acini appear to be composed of minute vescicles on which the ultimate divi- sions of the blood-vessels and pancreatic duct unite, directly or indirectly. The duct consists of an internal mucous coat, continuous with the inner membrane of the duodenum : and an external cellular coat. Its course. The arteries are from the branches of the caeliac and supe- rior mesenteric. Its veins belong to the Portal system. Its nerves are from the solar plexus. The Urinary Organs. ]. The urinary organs consist of the kidneys, the renal cap- sules, the ureters, the bladder, the urethra.* * The urethra, forming in the male, an essential part of the generative apparatus, will be considered with it.93 2. The kidneys are not constant in number. There are generally two. Their situation is in the lumbar regions, on the sides of the spine and behind the peritoneum, between the eleventh dorsal and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Thtir shape. Structure. The abundant fat which surrounds the kidney being removed, its external membrane is fibrous : thin, strong, and smooth externally. It allows a passage to the renal ves- sels, and sends many prolongations into the substance of the viscus to accompany them. This tunic being removed, the parenchyme of the kidney consists of an external, or cortical substance, and an internal, or tubular substance. The corti- cal substance appears to be composed of the minute subdivi- sions of the renal vessels, which, penetrating the gland by its fissure, approach its surface, and form arches concave towards that surface. From the convexity of these arches innumerable vessels proceed. The tubular substance is more pale; it pre- sents conical fasciculi, which are surrounded, except at the apex, by the cortical substance. The apices of these cones converge towards the fissure of the kidney. The cones con- sist of blood vessels and uriniferous tubes : the tubes being apparently continuous with the minute arteries, and proceeding in straight lines, which converge towards the fissure. The cones terminate by tubercular eminences called papt lice, on which the uriniferous tubes open. The Cahcex are membranous canals which embrace the papillae, and open into the pelvis of the kidney. They vary in number, from six to twelve or more:—one sometimes sur- rounding several papilla*. They coalesce to form three prin- cipal tubes before entering the pelvis. The Pelvis occupies the posterior part of the fissure, being covered in front by the renal artery and vein. It terminates below in the ureter. The Ureter is a membranous canal: cylindrical: extend- ing from the pelvis of the kidney to the urinary bladder. The two ureters arriving at the inferior and lateral regions94 of the bladder, pass, for the space of nearly an inch, ob- liquely through its parieles, and open into its cavity towards the posterior angles of the triangular space called trigonum vesica;. Description of the course of the ureter. The structure of the calices, of the pelvis, and of the ureter seems to be the same. The external coat is cellular, the internal a production of the mucous membrane of the bladder. Some conceive that the ureters are also provided with mus- cular fibres intermediate to the two coats. Haller, VII. “257• The renal arteries are of great capacity. They leave the aorta at a right angle. There is generally one for each kidney: sometimes three, or more. The veins have no valves : they open into the vena cava. The lymphatics of the kidney open into the thoracic duct. The renal plexus of nerves accompanies the subdivisions of the artery. It communicates with the caeliac, mesenteric and spermatic plexus, and with the splanchnic nerve. The nerves are few, in proportion to the size of the gland. 3. The Renal Capsules, are small bodies, oval in the adult, triangular and granulated in the foetus, which rest upon the upper and inner part of the kidney. They are hollow within. Structure, The external coat is a lamellated cellular tissue, which sends prolongations into the substance of the viscus. The substance of the viscus consists of lobes, lobules and acini. The arteries are from the diaphragmatic, the aorta, the renal arteries : they are proportionably more voluminous in infancy than in advanced age. The veins terminate, on the right side, generally in the vena cava;—on the left in the renal vein. The lymphatics and nerves belong to the renal plexus. 4. The urinary bladder is a membranous and muscular reservoir ; situated, in the adult, in the cavity of the pelvis. Its shape is conical : its dimensions very vari- able. It presents six regions: a superior, an inferior, two lateral, an anterior, a posterior region. The supe-95 rior region is sometimes called the vertex: it is in con- tact with the convolutions of the small intestines, and connected to the umbilicus by the L rachus. The inferior region is bounded below by the prostate gland, and behind by the fold which the peritoneum forms in passing from the bladder to the rectum: the most deep seated portion of this region is generally called the fundus of the bladder. In the male it rests upon the rectum and vesiculae seminales ; in the female on the vagina. The fundus is contracted into the neck of the bladder, which is continued into the urethra. Structure. The serous covering of the bladder is only partial. On the anterior region, on the anterior portions of the lateral and vertical regions, and on the inferior region, it is deficient.—The muscular eoat consists of whitish bands disposed in different directions. These are more closely collected together near the neck of the bladder. Here also the more internal fibres assume a circular disposition, and are called sphincter visicce. Cellular membrane connects the muscular fibres with each other, and with the internal, or mucous membrane of the bladder.—The mucous membrane is continuous with that of the urethra, and of the ureters. It is not thick: its villi very delicate. The mucous follicles are small but abundant. The inner surface, in the un- distended state, presents numerous plica;: and, in some sub- jects, projecting permanent columns, which cross in all direc- tions, and leave intermediate cellular spaces. This appear- ance is due to the peculiar disposition of the muscular coat. On the inner surface are also observable, the trigonum vesica;, the uvula vesica;, the orifices of the ureters, the orifice at the neck of the bladder. The arteries of the bladder, are from the hypo-gastric, ischiatic, haimorrboidalis media, pudica interna. The veins form a net-work near the fundus and neck, and terminate in the bypo-gastric veins. The nerves are from the hypo- gastric plexus : and third and fourth sacral nerves.96 Urine.

The testicles are contained in the scrotum. The scro- tum described : the skin : the dense cellular tunic called dartos, dividing the scrotum into two oval sacs, one for each testicle. Beneath this, are the expanded fibres of the cremaster muscle. Beneath the muscular coat, is a cellular sheath, common to the testicle and its cord, an expansion of the membrane which accom- panies the spermatic vessels through the ring. The peritoneum also sends a production into the scrotum; by its attached surface, it adheres, in front and on the sides, to the two last membranes; behind, it is reflected upon the epididymis, the testicle, the anterior and infe- rior portion of the cord. 2. The testicles, are two glandular organs: vascular: oval. Their situation at the posterior part of the scrotum: the inferior edge is also inclined forward : the superior upward, and is bounded by the epididymis. Structure. Beneath the serous tunic (vaginalis testis) is the fibrous membrane called albuginea : it is white and presents much resistance. Its internal surface rests97 upon the substance of the testicle, into which it sends many filaments. These filaments are directed towards the poste- rior edge of the testicle, and subdivide the organ. The parenchyme of the testicle is soft and pulpy ; consisting of the innumerable subdivisions of the arteries, veins, nerves and seminiferous tubes, connected by very delicate cellular membrane. The seminiferous ducts do not ramify, or com- municate will) each other. They open into larger vessels (rasa ejferentia) which anastomose, and at length form ten or twelve principal trunks. These traverse the albuginea at the upper part of the posterior edge, where is an eminence called corpus Highmorianum, and terminate in the epi- didymis. The arteries of the testicle are the spermatic : they also supply the epididymis. The lymphatics form from six to twelve trunks, which pass along the cord, accompany the spermatic artery, and terminate principally in the lumbar glands. The nerves are from the ganglia—they are so small and soft that they cannot be traced into the substance of the testicle. .3. The Epididymis, is a small oblong body, swelling at its two extremities : extending throughout the whole poste- rior edge of the testicle. The anterior swelling adheres strongly to the testicle ; receives the vasa efferentia, and is called the head of the Epididymis. The middle por- tion adheres to it by means of the tunica vaginalis. 'The inferior portion is intimately united to the testicle, and is reflected backwards and upwards to constitute the vas deferens. Structure. The Epididymis consists of a single canal, whose numerous convolutions are folded upon each other. The folds are connected by cellular membrane, and supplied with blood-vessels. Monro counted more than 11,000 such flexures. He found the diameter of the tube to be the eighti- eth part of an inch, and estimated its length at thirty-one feet. G98 4. The vas deferens is continued from the inferior extremity of the Epididymis : it mounts in a tortuous course behind tiie testicle, with the other vessels of the cord. It leaves these on reaching the abdomen, descends backwards and inwards, passes behind the umbilical artery, and arrives at the posterior and inferior part of the bladder. It crosses the direction of the ureter, passes on the side of the vesicula seminalis. It is joined by the duct of the vesicula, and approaches the vas deferens of the oppo- site side. The two tubes run between the prostate and urethra, and perforate that canal obliquely. Structure. The vas deferens is formed of two membranes. The internal belongs to the mucous system :—the external is dense and resisting, its nature is unknown. o. Vesiculae Seminales. Their connection with the bladder : their situation on the outside of the vasa deferentia. The inferior portion of each vesicula is contracted into a narrow canal, which unites with the vas deferens at a very acute angle. Structure. The vesicula? seminales are membranous re- servoirs consisting of a tortuous canal which gives off laterally appendices, varying in number from four to twenty. The convolutions of the canal and its appendices are closely united by dense cellular membrane. They are composed of two tunics: an external cellular, and an internal mucous mem- brane abounding with villi. 6. The Spermatic cord consists of the spermatic artery and veins, lymphatics, the nerves of the epididymis and of the testicle, the vas deferens, cellular tissue and membranes. The artery and veins are on the fore-part of the cord: the vas deferens behind and on the inside. 7. The Penis is a membranous and vascular organ, formed ! of a prolongation of the integuments : the urethra and gland : the corpora cavernosa : muscles, vessels, and nerves. *99 The skin is very loosely connected to the parts below: it abounds with sebaceous glands : the praeputium : the frenu- lum penis. The suspensory ligament of the penis. The Urethra, extends from the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the glans penis : it is a continuous canal, of which the external structure is different in different portions. The posterior portion extends from the neck of the bladder a few lines beyond the prostate, by which it is almost entirely surrounded. This portion is surrounded by a stratum of muscular fibres, which proceed obliquely forward to be inserted into the accelerator urina*, and ossa pubis, and back- ward into the neck of the bladder. This is called the muscu- lar and membranous portion of the urethra. Vid. Cuvier. Anat. Comp. Vol. IV. p. 472. The remainder of the urethra is called the spongy portion ; from the structure which surrounds the canal. This vascu- lar, or cellular, structure begins by an oval swelling, called the bulb of the urethra: from whence it extends throughout the whole remainder of the urethra, and at its fore part expands into the glans penis. The Corona glandis : its ex- ternal covering, continuous with the skin of the penis, and with the mucous membrane of the urethra, of a nature inter- mediate to both : its mucous and sebaceous glands. The inner membrane of the canal belongs to the mucous system. It is red near the orifice of the canal and provided with numerous follicles : in the rest of its extent it is pale. The inner surface of the canal does not present the same breadth throughout. It is dilated near the bladder : narrow where the urethra passes the prostate. The spongy portion dilates near the base of the glans penis: the dilatation is called by Morgagni fossa navicularis. In this fossa the mucous glands abound. The Crest of the Urethra, or Veru montanum, is a projection, about an inch in length, continuous with the uvula vesicse. It is formed by the mucous mem- brane. On its sides are situated the orifices of the vasa defe-JOG rentia, and ot the ducts of the prostate gland. In front of these, and in the bulbous portion, are the orifices of Cowper’s Glands. Externally, is a membrane of condensed cellular tissue: thin in the membranous portion, and sensibly thicker on the bulb and spongy portion. The Corpora Cavernosa, form nearly two-thirds of the bulk of the penis : they extend from the anterior and inner part of the tuberosity of the ischium to the gland. The two crura of the corpora cavernosa arriving in front of the sym- physis are united, and rest upon the upper surface of the urethra. Their anterior extremity is received into the hollow base of the glans penis. To their upper surface the suspensory ligament of the penis is affixed. This surface also presents a furrow for the reception of the arteria dorsalis penis and vein. Its inferior surface is furrowed for the reception of the spongy portion of the urethra, which is connected to it by cellular membrane. Structure. The cavernous body is composed of an ex- ternal fibrous membrane, of variable thickness, extensible and contractile : it presents on its fore part numerous pores for vessels which communicate with those of the gland. This membrane sends.a production, in the median plane, which serves as an imperfect division of the cavernous body into two portions. A spongy tissue fills the cavity of this membrane: it is composed of filaments from the fibrous membrane, of arteries, and of veins surpassing the arteries in number and magnitude. These vessels do not appear to communicate with those of the urethra. The muscles of the penis : vid. p. 19- The prostate gland is of a conical shape; it invests the anterior part of the neck of the bladder, and posterior part of the urethra. It is also traversed by the vasa deferentia. It appears to be formed of cellular tissue and of mucous follicles. Its two lobes. The ducts, from eight to twelve, open on the sides of the crest of the urethra. Coupee's glands: these are a collection of mucous glands situated behind the bulb of the urethra, in front of the pros-m—iOl tate, and on the inside of the crura of the cavernous body. Their excretory ducts open in the bulbous portion of the urethra. The arteries of the penis are principally from the internal pudic. Its absorbents open principally into the inguinal plexus, some into the hypo-gastric. Its nerves are from the pudic and lesser sciatic. The Organs of Generation of the Female. ]. The ovaries and Fallopian tubes. The ovaries are two in number : of an oval shape : a redish colour : situated in the posterior folds of the broad ligament of the uterus. By their outer edge they are attached to a portion of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes. By their inner edge they are attached to the uterus, by means of a vascular cord called the ligament of the ovary. The ovaries are surrounded by perito- neum, except on their inferior margin. Structure. Beneath the peritoneum is a dense cellular tissue forming the outer membrane of the ovary, which sends prolongations into its substance. Within it, is the parenchyme of the organ ; composed of cellular lobules with blood-vessels and nerves. In the cells are numerous vesicles consisting of a vascular membrane which contains a fluid. The arteries of the ovaries are the spermatic arteries : the nerves are from tire renal plexus ; the lymphatics open into the lumbar glands. The Fallopian tubes are situated within the folds of the broad ligaments of the uterus. They are about four inches in length : open by a small orifice into the uterus at its angles. The other extremity is wide and fimbriated : by one portion of the fringe alone, they are attached to the ovaries: the tube thus opening by a small orifice into the cavity of the peritoneum. Besides the partial peritoneal coveriug. the tubes consist of two membranes : of these102 the external is cellular, spongy, and highly vascular: the internal, continuous with the mucous membrane of the ute- rus, extends somewhat beyond the external, and essentially constitutes the corpus Jimbriatum. 2. The uterus : n its shape : its situation in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum. Above, it is covered by the convolutions of the small intestines; below, it is continuous with the vagina. Its upper and broadest portion is called the fundus: the body gradu- ally narrows into the neck. The lower portion of the neck projects into the vagina: the cavity of the uterus communicating with that of the vagina by the os tinccc. The cavity of the uterus : the superior angles : the open- ings of the Fallopian tubes. The ligaments of the uterus, vid. page 86. Structure. The serous covering adheres intimately to the superior edge of the uterus : more loosely, elsewhere. Be- neath it, particularly on the surfaces, is a dense cellular tissue, free from fat, by which it is separated from the proper substance of the uterus. It is upon this proper tissue that the thickness of the uterus depends: its texture is compact and resisting : of a greyish colour: traversed by numerous small vessels: it is most dense near the neck of the uterus: its nature is unknown, it resembles no other structure in the body. It adheres closely to the internal mucous membrane. The mucous membrane of the uterus is very thin: villi are scarcely apparent: the orifices of the mucous crypt® are most numerous near the neck : with a microscope the open orifices also of an infinite number of pores, or vessels, may be observed. » The uterine arteries are numerous: they are from the spermatic, and the uterine divisions of the hypo-gastric ar- teries. They have a very tortuous distribution in the midst of the cellular membrane which is beneath the serous coat. The veins are even more tortuous : the plexus pampiniformis of Haller. The nerves of the uterus are from the hypo-♦103 gastnc plexus ; near the vagina they are assisted by fila- ments from the sacral nerves. The lymphatics are very numerous: they join the hypo-gastric, the lumbar, the external iliac plexus. 3. The vagina is u membranous canal extending from the neck of the uterus to the vulva. Its situation, between the rectum and bladder. Structure. It has a slight peritoneal covering at its upper portion: by its lower it is connected to the bladder and rectum, a loose cellular tissue intervening. The cellular tissue becomes more dense near the vulva. Beneath the cellular membrane is a thin tissue peculiar to the vagina, continued, at its upper portion into the proper substance of the uterus : at the lower orifice of the vagina devolving into a spongy structure, the plexus retiformis.—The internal mucous membrane is continuous with that of the vulva, and of the vagina: it is thinnest near the neck of the uterus : abounds in mucous follicles ; presents numerous plic*. The arteries form a net-work round the vagina, they are from the uterine, the haemorrhoidales media', pudica» interna, the vesicales. The absorbents communicate with the inter- nal iliac plexus. The nerves are from the hypo-gastric plexus, and sacral nerves. 4. The vulva comprises all the more external organs of generation in the female. These are the pubis, labia externa, labia interna (or nymphas), clitoris, orifice of the urethra, orifice of the vagina, the hymen. 6. The mamma;: their situation upon the pectoral muscles. The areola: its subcutaneous glands. The nipple: the opening of the lactiferous tubes. Structure. The glandular part of the mamma is small in comparison of the whole bulk of the organ. It consists of small lobes which are connected by cellular membrane. The lobes are more closely connected near the centre of the104 gland; near its circumference, they form irregular appendices. The gland is situated in the midst of much fat, nearer to the integuments than to the pectoral muscles. The fat is en- closed in cells much larger than those of common adipose cellular membrane.—The lactiferous tubes arise from the lobes of the gland, and from the surrounding adipose sub- stance. These at length form from fifteen to twenty ducts which pierce the spongy tissue of the nipple, and open upon its outer surface. The arteries of the mamma are from the internal thoracic, the external thoracic and axillary arteries. The absorbents terminate principally in the axillary plexus : some, at the same time, penetrate the thorax, and open into the thoracic duct, or subclavian vein. The nerves are from the sympa- thetic, the third and fourth cervical nerves.

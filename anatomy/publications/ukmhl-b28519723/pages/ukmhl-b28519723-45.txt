We wiil suppose that, at some unknown era of the world, and, ‘‘.under circumstances with “ which we are not sufficiently acquainted,’* these varieties began to take place, i. e. to use more common language, these national distinc- tions began to appear. Now, Sir, supposing that climate, and food, and manners, had no- thing to do with these distinctions, why is it that the individuals of the same nation do not jn time as much differ from each other, as these Mongolian or Caucasian varieties ? The same circumstances, however odd and unaccountable they may be, would, in the course of events, na- , turally occur again and again, and would pro- duce similar effects. You hint, indeed, that such is the case between the English and the Scotch, and that we are to account for the high cheek bones of the latter on this very principle. But I maintain that these principles, if carried to their full extent, would destroy all national peculiarities whatever; since there w^ould be an endless variation of varieties in the same people, and it is probable that some of these varieties - would be not less striking than those between Negroes and Europeans. But, leaving these unintelligible speculations, I would now proceed to offer some remarks on the consequences which you deduce. Having laid it down as an incontrovertible fact, that these varieties exist, and that they arise from a difference of the internal organization, you en- deavour to establish the consequence, that-there

9 LETTER II. Sir, . In your introductorji Lecture, you have endeavoured' to establish the doctrine of mate- rialism in its grossest and most disgusting form, as will be apparent from the following quota- tion:—Where then shall we find the proofs of the mind’s independence on the bodily ‘‘ structure? of that mind, which, like the cor- poreal form, is infantile in the child, manly ‘‘ in the adult, sick and debilitated in disease, frenzied or melancholy in the madman, en- ‘‘ feebled in the decline of life, doting in decre- pitude, and annihilakd hy^death p. 7- Before you had resolved to publish such opi- nions, you should, at least, have inquired who they are that believe in the independence of the mind on the bodily structure?

This con- nexion vre call life; but the mind itself consti- tutes the soul of man. However you may please

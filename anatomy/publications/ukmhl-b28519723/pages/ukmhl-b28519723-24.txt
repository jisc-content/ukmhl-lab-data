22 LETTER IV. Sir, . I MUST acknowledge, that your third Lec- ture abounds with many solid and striking ob- servations on the extent and limits of human science,as connected with physiology: in which, as you remark,* we follow the links of an endless chain, and by holding fast to it, we may ascend from one link to another; but the point of suspension is not within the ‘‘ reach of our feeble powers.” To call life,” you continue, a property of organization would be unmeaning — it would be nonsense.”—Now, Sir, permit me to confront this opinion with the following sen- tence in the ensuing Lecture.f Such a kind of composition (viz. of solids and fluids) and such an arrangement of the constituent parts,^ is called organization; and as the vital pheno- mena are only such motions as are consistent with these material arrangements, life, so far as our experience goes, is necessarily con- nected with organization. Life pre-supposes organization, as the movement of a watch pre-supposes wheels, levers, and other mecha- nism of the instrument.” * P.82. t P. 93, and p. 104.

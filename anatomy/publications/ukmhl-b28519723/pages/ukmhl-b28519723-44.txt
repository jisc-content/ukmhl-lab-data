42 account for the changes of Proteus, or oblige the sceptic to maintain a unity of argument ? Verum ubi correptum manibus vinclisque tenebis; Turn variae eludent species atque ora ferarum. Fiet enim subito sus horridus, atraque tigris, Squamosusque draco, &c. &c. Since you appear, however, on the whole to resolve these diversities into varieties of the same species, it is necessary for us to endeavour to understand what you mean by this word. The following sentence is the most intelligible which I can find, as explanatory of your opinion:— “ Under certain circumstances, with which we are not well acquainted, a more important change of organization occurs. A new cha- racter springs up, and is propagated by gene- ration; this constitutes a variety^ in the Ian- guage of naturalists,” p. 97. Truly, Sir, this description savours marvellously of the occult qualities of the ancients. I should be glad to learn in what history of mankind you have ever met with occurrences of this nature. Unless you can produce something more determinate and authentic, than this explanation, I am afraid that the opinions of Hunter and BufFon, and your friend Blumenbach, which resolve these ^varieties of the human race into the effects of climate and food, &c. are likely to remain unaf- fected by your speculations. Let us, however, attempt to argue the point on the principles which you have here laid down.

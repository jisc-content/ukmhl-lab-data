To put a finishing stroke to this controversy, you refer to Pathology as affording the most signal evidences in favour of materialism. They who consider the mental operations as acts of an immaterial being, and thus discon^* nect the sound state of the mind from organ- ization, act very consistently in disjoining insanity also from the corporeal structure, and in representing it as a disease, not of the brain, but of the mind. Thus we come to disease of an immaterial being, for which, suit- ably enough, moral treatment has been recom- mended/’ Yes, Sir, we accept your chal- lenge, and are obliged to you for this appeal. The Retreat at York, and many other recep- tacles for insane persons, will furnish you with the result. But here, as in every other part of the argument, you misstate the question. We do not disjoin the corporeal, organs from the mental faculties; nor is it found that moral treatment will suffice without the aids of medi- cine. It is the conjunction of both which affords the best means of recovery; and for this plain reason—that they apply to both the mental and corporeal parts of our constitution.

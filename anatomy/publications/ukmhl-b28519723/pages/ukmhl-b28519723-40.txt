38 to present to you a few of the contradictory statements which you have made on this sub- ject, before you pronounce me either incor- rigibly stupid, or wilfully blind. Pity me. Sir, I am only in the situation in which you repre- sent Ajax—‘‘ I require nothing but day-light and fair play.’* p. 107. On reviewing the facts,” you say, which are detailed in the foregoing pages, we see, ‘‘ that, although the various races of men differ from each other in stature, as well as in other V points, these differences are confined within narrower limits in man than in the species of domestic animals, and consequently that they do not prove diversity of species.” * This reasoning does not appear very luminous ; but we are enabled to collect from it, at least, your opinion. Now, I would beg you to con- trast with this sentence the following, which occurs at p. 555: I cannot yet assume it as a point fully proved, that all the varieties of mankind have proceeded from one and the same breed.” Indeed, Sir, then I should sup- pose we ought to withhold our assent to attri- buting them to one and the same species. If it could be shown, that the Mongolian, Ethio- pian, American, and Malay varieties have re- ally proceeded from different stocks; then, it would prove them to be in fact, different spe- cies; and in as much as you are doubtful on * P. 443, and p. 303.

well if you had imitated, not only the experi- mental research, but the piety of this father and founder of modem physiology/’ Haller was a believer not only in all the great truths of natural religion, but a zealous advocate for the truth and authority of the Christian revelation. In an admirable work addressed to his daughter, he has left us his deliberate opinions on this subject. Your father, who now addresses you, during the course of a long life, spent in continual labour and study, thought him- self obliged to consecrate some of his leisure hours, to inquiries of this nature. The re- suit of which was, that those truths which have been called in question, always ap- peared to him the more evident and res- ‘‘ pectaHe, the more attentively he examined the proofs and reasons on which they were founded.” The rock of salvation is solidity itself. It cannot be shaken, either by the doubts of the sceptic, or the sarcasms of the sneerer.” I remain, &c.

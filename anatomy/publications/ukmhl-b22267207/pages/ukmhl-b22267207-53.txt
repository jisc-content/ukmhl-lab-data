43 Of the Mufcular Fibre. . < ROM the preceding view of the nervous fyltem, it is evident that the beginning of motion, in the animal ceco- nomy, is generally connected with fen- fation. And the ultimate effeCts of fuch motion, are aCtions depending on the con- traction of the moving, or mufcular fi- bres, and this is called'mufcular motion; which is necelfary to all living animals, and which, together with their particular ItruCture, and organization, is now to be explained. The mufcular fibre, makes all that part of the animal body, called flefh. Itâ€™s colour in man, and quadrupeds, is red; in fome birds and fiifii, white ; in infieds, green. The red colour is not inherent in the mufcle, but is owing to the quantity of blood, contained in it: as by walhing and injeCling a limb with water, and then making a tranfverfe feCtion, it may be made white. And parts may be muf- cular, though not red, as the iris. The mufcles in the dead body, are foft F2 and

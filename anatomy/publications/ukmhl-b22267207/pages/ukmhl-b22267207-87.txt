Diseases of the Lymphatics 77 which become indurated, and afterwards break out into ulcers. The matter con- tained in the lymphatics in this difeafe, has the appearance of earth and curds. Confumptions frequently depend on this difeafe. The lymphatics are too bibulous in the fcrophula, and it is to be remarked, that where the abforbents lofe their tone, the exhalants do likewife; and vice ver- fa.

Lymphatics are fometimes opened in wounds, difcharging lymph from a fun- gous fubftance, of a yellow appearance. The ,beft application to it, is the lunar cauftic, and lint wet with fpirit of wine over that.

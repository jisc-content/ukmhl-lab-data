Their fhape in the human body, flat and round, like a piece of money ; in fome animals, oblong, or el- liptical. Each particle is a compound, folid body, flat and round, confining of two parts : viz. a fmall folid particle, called the central particle; and an exter- nal covering, or veficle, in which the former is contained like a pea in a bladder. Blood kept till putrefied, and diluted with water, fhews with a micro- fcope, the veficles burfting, and the par- ticles rolling out. The particles may be made fpherical, by an addition of water; and, by a mixture with a folution of neu- tral fait, may be again reflored to their o- riginal flat figure. They are not more oily, faponaceous, or inflammable, than 0 ing to the number of them. Dr. Fordyce fay*, the colour is acquired in parting the lungs.

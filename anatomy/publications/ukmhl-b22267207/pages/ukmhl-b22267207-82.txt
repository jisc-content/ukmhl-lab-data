In the leg, the fuperficial come firft, to the femoral gland. The deep feated come firft to the popliteal, and then to the femoral, and both go to the inguinal, where the lymphatics of the organs of generation terminate. T hey then come up by feveral trunks, under the ligamentum pouparti, and go on both fides cf the aorta, with thofe which come from the uterus &c. and join the lafteals which come up in the courfe of the fu- perior mefenteric artery, and all termi- nate in the thoracic du£t. The thoracic duft, la&eals, and lym- phatics, are furnilhed with valves, which are much more numerous in thefe vef- fels, than in the veins. Thefe valves are ufually in pairs, 5 or 6 pair in every inch of the tube. They ferve to pro- mote the courfe of the chyle and lymph, towards the thoracic duft, and to pre- vent it’s return. A ligature pafted round the crural ar- tery, in a living animal, by including them, will occalion a diftention below the ligature, fo as to demonftrate them with

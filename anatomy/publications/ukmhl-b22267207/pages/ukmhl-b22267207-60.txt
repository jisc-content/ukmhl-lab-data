The firfl returns all the blood, circu- lated by the different branches of the aorta afcendens, above the diaphragm; the fecond, all circulated by the differ- ent branches of the aorta defcendens, be- low the diaphragm, into the right auricle of the heart; from thence the blood is carried into the right ventricle, and by the arteria pulmonahs to the lungs. The two right pulmonary veins, return the blood from the right pulmonary artery, Jnto the left auricle, and from thence it is carried to the left ventricle of the heart. The two left, return it from the left pulmonary artery, into the left au- ricle alfo, and from it the blood paffes into the left ventricle, whence the aorta originates, diftributing it, by it's branches, to every, the moll minute part of the animal. The power which circulates the blood, is the mufcular power of the heart and arteries, and the elaflicity of the arteries themfelves. The blood is thrown out by the contraction of the arteries, which is called the fyjlole, this immediately brings on the dilatation, or diajlole; for when the heart contraCis, the arteries di- late

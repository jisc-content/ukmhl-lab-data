Of Bone. lOl being defcribed, it may be proper to take iome notice, of’ the difeafes of the joints, in this place.* They are generally, lux- ations, fubluxations, and anchylolis. A * luxation is the effeft of a remo- val of the bone, forming any joint of the body, from it’!s proper cavity, or articu- lation : and it may proceed from feve- ral caufes, either internal, or external. The internal caufes are, difeafe in the head of the bone, or in any of the li- gaments, or cartilages, by which it is connefted ; the external caufes producing luxation may be various. Luxations imT mediately produced, and before any in_ flammation is come on, may be difcover- ed by the dire&ion of the limb ; as for example, when the fuperior end is out- wards, the inferior end will be inwards, and vice vtrfa. It may alio be known by the length of the limb. In order to reduce luxations, in gene- ral, it is only necelfary to place the limb, and indeed the whole body, fo far as it may influence the direclion of the limb, in the greatefl bate of relaxation, and by this means, and a gradual extenfion, * * ' * From luxo.. to disjoint.

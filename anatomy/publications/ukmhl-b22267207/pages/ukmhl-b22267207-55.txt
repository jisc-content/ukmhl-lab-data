This is compofed of arteries, veifts} nerves, abforbent veffels, and cellular fub- ftance ; which are the whole * apparatus neceffary, to produce mufcular motion, without any conftituent mufcular fibre, and which cannot be demonftrated here. So,as mufcular motion is performed,without any conftituent mufcular fibre being de- monftrable; hence we may fairly infer, it’s abfence in all parts; more efpecial- ly, as the ftru&ure of the fuppofed con- ftituent fibriles, is not underftood. The mufcular power, is different from elafticity ; it’s aftion is not conftant, but dependent on the nervous influence ; and is exerted by ftimuli, which are of dif- ferent kinds, viz. Mechanical, Mental, And, others of a fpecific kind. jpark, when the light is taken away it dilates.

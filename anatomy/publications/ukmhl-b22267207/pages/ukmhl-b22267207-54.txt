They have arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatic veffels: alfo cellular fubflance. There are many ramifications in a muf- cle, and the veffels go from a circum- ference, to a centre. The arteries run parallel, and by the preparations of Liberkuin, mufcles appear nothing more, than a congeries of veffels. It was generally fuppofed, that the ar- teries opened into veficles, which made the conflituent part of a mufcle; and a diflenhon of the part, was produced by this means, and caufed a contraftion.

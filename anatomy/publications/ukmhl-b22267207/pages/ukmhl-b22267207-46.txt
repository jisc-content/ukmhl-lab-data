The capfular ligament, is compofed of two layers, the one external, from the periofteum; the other internal, and ex- ceedingly vafcular. The internal furface, forms a complete bag, and in a found flate, is perfe&ly in- fenfible. The fluid which is fecreted in the joints, and which we call finovia, or the fmovial fluid, is the fame as neat’s-foot oil in cattle.

The annular ligaments are bands, which bind the flexor, and extenfor tendons, and keep the bones of the hand, and foot, in their places. The intermufcular ligaments, between the brachius internus, is made of the in- elaftic ligamentous fibre. The fafciae or bands, by the antients called, '*aponeurofts, (erroneoufly fuppofed to be an cxpanfton of a nerve,) are ten- * Aponeurofis, from the greek words apo dc from, and neuron nervus a nerve. dinous

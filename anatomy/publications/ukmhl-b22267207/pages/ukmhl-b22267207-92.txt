Preparation, Chemical alteration, Depuration, and Excretion. / We conceive that the arteries, have a power to modify the blood, in fuch a manner, as to bring it nearly to the na- ture of the fluid, fecreted by the particu- lar gland, to which it is conveying it; this we call preparation. And we ap- prehend it especially to take place, in the artery going to the teflicle; which, by it’s being derived from the aorta, and by it’s length, and circumvolutions in the gland itfelf, appears to modify or prepare the blood, for the fecretion of that moft important fluid, the femen. With refpeft to the chemical altera- tion, the blood undergoes in the body; the fecretion of the bile in the liver, clear- ly fhews that fuch an alteration does take place in this, and other glands, as the blood when entering the liver, has the fame tafle as the other blood. This al- teration feems very much to depend on the nervous influence, though we confefs ourfelves ignorant of the modus operandi. Depuration, is the taking off from the fluid.

I 74 Of the Lymphatic System* you make the above experiment, tie up all the veflels in the courfe of the coro- nary artery. The lymphatics of the kidneys may be demonftrated in like manner. From the Tefticles, they go and join thofe of the kidney; but fometimes go into a gland, near the abdominal porti- on of the aorta. This fyftem is nourifhed after the fame manner, as all other parts of the bo- dy ; for even the moil minute of thefe veflels, are probably fupplied by ftill more minute arteries and veins. This feems to be proved, by the inflam- mation of which they are fufceptible; and the painful fwellings, which fome- times take place in lymphatic veflels, prove that they have nerves as w ell as blood veflels. The lymphatics are the only fyllem of abforbents; the proofs of which are, \{t. Their analogy with the lafteals. 2ndiy.

( f)-^ ) inside of the tibia, and accompanied by a cutaneous nerve, the nei vus saphenus. 2. Several cutaneous nerves, branching on tlie outer and fore part of the leg and foot, and derived lro!ii the nervus pcroneus. The fascia should then be dissected OiT; and, in doing this, remark, that it is firmly attached to the bones, and also to the bellies of the muscles at the upper part of the leg, so that their surfaces appear ragged, where the fibres are separated which arose from the inside of the fascia: Remark also that it sends down processes between the muscles; these are nam.ed intermuscular ligaments, Q.r tendons; they give origin to the fibres of all the muscles betwixt which they pass, connecting them together insepa- rably, so that the dissection is difficult, and has a rough appearance. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE-PART AND OUTSIDE OF THE LEG. These are six in number. 1. The Tibialis Anticusâ€”Arises, principally fleshy, from the exterior surfiice of the tibia, from its anterior angle or spine, and from nearly half of the interosseous ligament; from these surfaces it con- tinues to arise down two-thirds of the length of the bone ; also from the inner surface of the fascia of the leg, and from the intermviscular ligaments. The fleshy fibres descend obliquely, and terminate in a strong tendon, which crosses from the outside to the fore-part of the tibia, passes through a distinct ring of the

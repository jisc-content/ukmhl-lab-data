( V ) *}uus descendens ;—obliquus major ;—llio pubi-cos- to-abdominal. In the course of the dissection of this smgle mus- cle, the following points must be attended to. Tl>e LiNEA Alba, a white line running along the middle of the abdomen, from the cartilago ensiformis to the OS pubis; formed by the tendinous fibres of the two obliqui and the transversalis muscles, interlaced with those of the same muscles on the opposite side; it is half an inch broad at the navel ; and decreases gradually both above and below tliat part; but par- ticularly in the latter situation, wliere it is reduced at last to a mere line. LiNEA Semilunaris, a semicircular white line, running from the os pubis obliquely upwards over the side of the abdomen, at the distance of about four inches from the linea alba ; formed by the tendons of the two oblique and transverse muscles uniting at the edge of the rectus, before they separate to form the sheath for that muscle. LiNE^ Tkansversje, three or four white linesj crossing from the linea semilunaris to the linea alba ; formed by the tendinous intersections of the recti shining through the strong sheath which covers them:—These are not evident in all subjects in this stage of the dissection., Umbilicus, or Navel. This which, before the integuments were removed, was a depression, ap- peal's now a prominence; it consists of condensed cellular membrane :—In the foetus, it was a foramen which gave passage to the two umbilical arteries, the umbilical vein, and the urachus. a 4; Annulus

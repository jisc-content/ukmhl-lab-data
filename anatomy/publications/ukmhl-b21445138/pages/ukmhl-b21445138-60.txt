( 28 ) aorta, below the spermatic arteries ; it passes in the mesentery to the left side of the abdomen, where it divides as follows. (1.) The Coi.icA Sinistra, an artery which ascends along the left side of the colon, to inos- culate with the A. Colica Media. (2.) Branches which pass to the sigmoid flexure. (3.) The great trunk of the artery runs down behind the rectum, on which it ramifies largely, and is termed Akt. Hemorrhoidalis Interna. 7. The Lumbar Arteries are five or six small arteries on each side,, which arises from the back- part of the aorta, and arÂ« distributed to the spinal canal, peritoneum, muscles of tlie spine, and of the sides of the abdomen and, pelvis. They inosculate with the A. Epigastrica, Circumflexa ilii, &c. 8. A. Sacra Media is a single artery, arises from the back-part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the anterior surface of the sa- crum, giving twigs to ail tlie neighbouring parts. At the fourth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifurr cates into the two primitive or common iliacs. The Iliac A Communis runs along the edge of ' the psoas muscle, and at an inch or two from its origin divides into, (1.) The Internal Iliac, which passes do^vn into the pelvis. (2.) The External Iliac, which following the direction of the psoas muscle, passes under Pou- jpart's ligament, and becomes the inguinal artery. 2. VEINS.

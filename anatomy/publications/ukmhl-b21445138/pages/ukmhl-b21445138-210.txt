i IS8 ) tinder surface of the root of the lungs to the spine and ribs. A triangular space is formed betwixt the two pleura and the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae; this space,or cavity is named the cavity of the pos- terior mediastinum. It contains many important parts, and must therefore be carefully dissected. But first let us attend to the course of the inter- costal, or great sympathetic nerve, which is seen running by the side of the spine. The Intercostal Nerve, where it enters tlie thorax, is situated behind the great vessels; close upon the articulation of the first rib with the body of the first dorsal vertebra, it forms a ganglion, a twig of which fairly encircles the subclavian artery^ while other filaments are entwisted round the root of the vertebral artery. The intercostal nerve than descends along the thorax ; it lies upon the heads of the i*ibs, where they arearticulated with the vertebrse; it receives additional branches from all the dorsal nerves, and in each intercostal space it forms a gang«- lion. This nerve may be dissected with greater fa- cility when the lungs are removed, and the ribs sawed. ©IF near the spine, which will enable the dissector to trace its branches more fully. It lies behind the pleura, but is seen through it; it passes into the ab- domen by the side of the spine, running through the fibres of the small muscle of the diaphragm.

( 55 ) 2. Course of the Obturator Nerve within the pelvis. '1 his nerve is formed by branches of the se- cond, third, and fourth lumbar nerves : it lies under the internal border of the pioas magnus, descends into the pelvis, and goes obliquely downwards, to accompany the obturator artery through the thyroid hole. 3. Course of the Great Sciatic Nerve within tlie pelvis. This nerve arises by branches from the fourth and fifth lumbar, and three first sacral nerves, which unite together to form the largest nervous trunk in the body. The nerve passes betwixt the pyriformis and gcmini, and thus escapes from the back-part of the pelvis by the sciatic notch. Some- times one of the branches goes through the pyrifor- mis, and joins the sciatic trunk at the back of the pelvis. OF THE SCROTUM. The scrotum consists externally of a loose, rugose ekin, and internally of condensed cellular membrane, which have been described as a muscle, under the name of Dartos. On dividing the anterior part of the scrotum, on' either side of the raphe, we expose, 1. The Testicle, a gland of an oval flattened form, covered by the tunica vaginalis, having on its upper edge an appendage termed Epididymis. 2. The Spermatic Chord, connecting the. testicle to the abdominal ring. It consists of, a, The spermatic artery, a branch of the aorta; c 4' this

The ExTiNsoR Skcundi Interkodii Pol- licis Manus—Arises, tendinous and fieshj', from the posterior surface of the ulna above its middle, and from the interosseous ligament. Its belly partly covers the origins of the two other extensors of the thumb, and terminates in a tendon, which runs through a distinct groove in the back-part of the radius, and is Inserted into the posterior and upper part of the second or extreme phalanx of the thumb. Use: To extend the last joint of the thumb ob- liquely backwards.

Situation of the extensors of the thumb.—The ori- gins of these muscles are concealed by the extensor digitorum communis and extensor carpi ulnaris.— Their bellies are seen coming from betwixt the exten- sor digitorum conununus and extensor carpi radialis brevior, and, passing under the annular ligament of the

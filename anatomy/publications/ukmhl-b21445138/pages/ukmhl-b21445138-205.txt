'( 183 ) embedded in adipose membrane, and seated m llie flexure of a joint. The axilla is tbrmed by two muscular folds which bound a middle cavity. The anterior fold is formed by the pectoralis major passing from the thorax to the arm^ the posterior by tlie Jatissimus dorsi coining from the back. In the intermediate cavity there is a quantity of cellular membrane and absorbent glands, covering and connecting the great vessels and nerves. This ■cellular and adipose membrane is.continued from the interstice above the clavicle betwixt the edges of the trapezius and mastoid muscles. All the space before the root of the neck above the first rib, and under the clavicle and coracoid process of the scapula, and •the interstices of the muscles passing through that space, are filled up by a quantity of adipose mem- brane ; and this is not exactly similar to the fat in ■other parts of the body; it is more granulated, wa- ■tery, and of a reddish colour ; it surrounds the great •vessels and nerve, rendering, the dissection both te- dious and difficult. The Axillary Vein will be found lying ante- rior to the artery, that is,- nearer the integuments* Jt seems to be a continuation of the basilic vein, which runs along the inside of the arm quite super- ficial, and of the two or three venae satellites, or veins which accompany the brachial artery. The axillary veins receives branches corresponding to the -ramifications of the artery. Passing under the cla- vi'icle, it becomes the subclavian vein, and runs over the

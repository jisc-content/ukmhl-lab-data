( 3^ ) tebra, it bifurcates into the two primitive or coninion iliac arteries. Branches of the Abdominal Aohta. l.The two Phrenic Arteries arise from the Aorta* before it has fairly entered into the abdomen, and ramify over the diaphragm; sometimes they come off in one trunk, which bifurcates ; sometimes one of tliera arises from the coeHac. 2. The CcELiAc Artery comes off at the point where the aorta has fairly extricated itself from the dia- phragm ; it is a single, large, but short trunk situated between the inferior surface of the liver, and the small curvature of the stomach, and surrounded by the meshes of the semilunar ganglion. It divides at once inbo three branches ; and as they depart in dif-^ ferent directions from one point, as from a centre, the trunk is called the Axis Arteri^ Cceliac-i; (I.) A. CoRONARiA Vkntriculi, the middle branch, is the smallest of the three; it passes from the axis towards the left side, and arriving at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it attaches itself to that organ, sends a branch round the cardia, named Ramus Cor onarice Dexter. The trunk itself is then continued' along the lesser curvature from left to right, to inos- culate with the pylorica or coronaria dextra: it sends off branches to the little epiploon,&c. It sometimes terminates in the liver, entering at the porta?, and then it is the largest of the branches of the coeliac. In this case, the trunk, after ascending towards the left to reach the cardia, is reflected to the right, in its

( 291 ) axilla, it runs along the inferior edge of the cAraco- brachiulis. Rather higher up than the middle of the oshuinen, it crosses over the tendinous insertion of that nniscle, being here situated between the bell)' o^ the biceps flexor cubiti, and the superior fibres of the brachiulis extenius. The artery then passes behind the inner edge of the biceps flexor cubiti, descending betwixt that muscle and the fibres of the brachialis iatcrnus. In dissecting this vessel, we find it invested by ii fascia or sheath, formed by cellular membrane and some tendinons fibres. This fascia may be traced extending from the internal intermuscular ligam|nt. It covers the brachial artery and radial nerve; and the great basilic vein, as it enters into the axilla, is found lying in the fore and inner part of this sheath. It supports and connects these ves- sels. On dissecting this fascia, we find, close to the margin of the coraco-brachialis and biceps flexor cubiti, the great radial nerve : under it the brachial artery ; and, more superficially seated, the venae co- miies and the venabasilica. As the artery approaches the lower extremity of the os humeri, it inclines for- wards toward the fold of the arm, and dives beneath the aponeurosis which arises from the inside of the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. Its situation at the fold of the arm has been described. BRANCHES OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 1. A. Profunda Humeri Superior, or Mus- cularis Superior, is sent off from the inner side of the brachial artery, immediately where it has left the fold of the arm-pit. It passes downwards and back- â– wards round the os humeri, and is accompanied by N 2 the

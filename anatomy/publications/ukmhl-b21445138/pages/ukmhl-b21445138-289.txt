Tlie fibres pnai; outvvard;^, run by the side of the tubercle of the radius, and pass over the outer edge of that bone, to be Inserted, tendinous and flesliy,into a rough surface on the back-part of the radius about its middle. Situation: Of thcmuscles which passfromthe inter- nal condyle, the pronator teres is situated nearest the outer edge of tlie arm. It lies immediately on the inside of the tendon of the brachialis internus. Its tendon, to arrive at its place of insertion, passes under the belly of the supinator longus, and, when that muscle is removed, will be found inserted into the ra- dius immediately below the supinator brevis. Use : To roll the radius, together with the handy inwards. Synonyma : Pronator teres, give Obliquu3 ;—Epi- trochlo-radial. 2.

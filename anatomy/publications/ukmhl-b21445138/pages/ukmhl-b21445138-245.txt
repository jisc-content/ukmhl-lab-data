( 223 ) CHAP. XI. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT OF THE EYE, rjpHE globe or ball of the eye is situated about the middle of the orbit. It is connected to the bone of its muscles, and by the optic nerve ; and all these parts are embedded posteriori)' in a soft, fatty substance, which fills up the bottom of the orbit,â€” The tunica, or membrana conjunctiva, is seen lining the inn^r surface of the eyelids, and reflected from them over the anterior part of thj gl ibj or the eye, so that the back-p.irt of the eye-bally and all the muscles and nerves, are situated behmd it. This membrane must therefore be dissected aw .y, the up- per part of the orbit, which is formed by the os fron- tis, removed with a saw, and the fat surrounding the muscks, vessels, and nerves, cautiously dissected away with the scissars.

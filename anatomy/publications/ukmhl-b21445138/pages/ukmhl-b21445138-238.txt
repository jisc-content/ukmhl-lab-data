« ( 21G ) fibres pass along the posterior arch behind tlie amyg- dalae, and run backwards to the superior and lateral part of the pharynx, wliere tliey are scattered, and mixed with those of the sfjlo-pharyngeus. Inserted into the edge of the upper and back-part of tlie tliyroid cartilage, and into the back-part of the pharynx. Situation: It forms the posterior half-arch or co- lumn. Use : To draw the uvula and velum downwards and backwards, and pull the thyroid cartilage and pharynx upwards: to shut the passage into the nos- trils, and in swallowing, to thrust the food from the fauces into the pharynx. Synonyma: 1 hyro-staphylinus:—Thyreo-pharyn- go-staphylinus:—Palato-pharyngien. 1 he Salpingo-Pharyxgeus of Albinus is com- posed of a few fibres of this muscle, -which arise from the anterior and lower part of the cartilaginous ex- tremity of the Eustachian tube, and are insertedinto tlie inner part of the last-mentioned muscle. 3. The CincuMFLKXUS, or Tensor Palati—Arises, from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, be- hind the foramen ovale, and from the Eustachian tube near its osseous part; runs down along the pterygoideus internus, and forms a round tendon^ which passes over the hook of the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and soon gpreads into a broad tendinous expansion. Inserted into the velum pendulum palati, and semilunar edge of the os palati. Situation:

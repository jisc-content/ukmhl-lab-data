pelvis, and from the concave siirfuce below tlie ridge; U forms a thick flat belly, In&srled, by a flat tendon into the linca aspera, immediately below the lesser trochanter. Siluation : Its origin lies on the inside of the belly of the psoas niagnus, where that muscle slides over the brim of the pelvis, and on the outside of the origin of the adductor longus :—It descends between the lower edge of the psoas, and the upper edge of the adductor longus; and it is inserted between these two muscles, and posterior to the origin of the vastus internus. Use: To bend the thigh forwards, to move it in- wards, and to perform rotation, by turning the toes outwards. Sijnonijma : Pectinaius—Pubio-femoral. 9. The Triceps Adductor Femoris consists of three distinct muscles, which, passing from the pelvis to the thigh, lie in diiferent layers upon one another, and have nearly the same action. (1.) The Adductor Longus. Arises, by a short strong tendon, from the upper and inner part of the OS pubis, near its symphysis;—forms a large trian- gular belly, which, as it descends, becomes broader, but less thicL Inserted, tendinous, into the middle part of the linca aspera, occupying rather moFe than one third of its length. Situation : It arises betwixt the pectinalis and gra- cilis, and above the adductor brevis:—The upper edge of its belly ranges with the lower edge of the pectiualis; and its insertion lies posterior to the origin D of

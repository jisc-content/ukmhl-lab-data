( 262 ) its insertion passes betwixt the bracliialis internum and brachialis externus. Tlie internal intermuscular ligament is seen ex- tending from the lower part of this muscle along a ridge to the internal condyle, and separating the brachialis internus from the brachialis externus, or third head of the triceps extensor cubiti. Use : To move the arm upwards and forwards. Synonyma: Coraco-humeral. 9. The Brachialis Internus—Arises, from the middle of the os humeri, by two fleshy slips, which pass on each side of the insertion of the del- toid muscle ; fleshy from all the fore-part of the bone below, nearly as far as the condyles. The fibres con- verge, pass over the elbow-joint, and adhere to the capsular ligament. Inserted, by a strong short tendon, into the rough surface immediately below the coronoid process of the ulna. Situation : The most external of the fleshy slips of this muscle lies between the deltoid and short head of the triceps extensor, the internal between the deltoid and coraco-brachialis. The belly is almost entirely concealed by the biceps flexor cubiti, excepting a small portion which projects beyond the outer edge of that muscle. The tendon dips down betwixt the supinator radii longus and pronator teres, crosses under the tendon of the biceps flexor, and is inserted on the inside of that tendon. Use : To bend the fore-arm. Synonyma: Brachiseus ;—Humero-cubital. 10. The 8

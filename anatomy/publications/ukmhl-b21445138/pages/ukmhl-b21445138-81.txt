It generally l)as aa opening in its upper part, but it is completely rup- . tured in the first coitus: its form is various, fre- quently seniilunar,, and then its base is ^ittached to t'le vestibulum, while its cornua extend upwards as far as the sides of tlia urethra. After the destruction of the hymen, in married women, we see some irregular projections marking the orifice of the vagina, and termed Caruncul;e MvRTirouMES : they are generally supposed to be the remains of the hymen, but are not exactly in the same situation. Behind these is the Vagina, or canal leading to the uterus; at the extremity of which may be felt projecting the Os Internum Uteri, or Os Tincje, but it cannot be seen without dissection. The skin should be now divided on the side of the right labium, and the dissection should be carried from the groin to the side of the anus; the cellular membrane must be carefully removed, in order to expose the following parts. We find the Clitoris consisting of two spongy bodies, termed Crura, which unite and form the body. The crus of each side is a cavernous body, arising from the ramus and upper part of the tube- rosity of the ischium, continued along the ramus of the OS pubis, and uniting with its fellow opposite to the symphysis pubis. The body formed by the crura does not extend upwards, but forms a curve down- wards towards the urethra; it is divided internally

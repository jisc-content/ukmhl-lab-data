( 237 ) the four oi- five superior cervical vertebras, by dis- tinct tendons, which lie behind similar tendons of the levator scapulae. Situution: This muscle is concealed by the ser- ratus superior posticus, and splenius capitis. Use: To bring the head am i upper vertebrae of the neck obliquely backwards. When both muscles act, they pull the head directly backwards. Sijiwntpna: Cervici-dorsi-mastgidien, et dorso- tracholien. Reflect it from the dorsal vertebrae. 8. The Serratus Posticus Inferiorâ€”Arises, by a broad thin tendon, from the spinous processes of the two or three inferior dorsal vertebrae, and from the three superior lumbar spines by the fascia lumborum. Inserted^ by distinct fleshy slips, into the lower edges of the four inferior ribs, at a little distance- from their cartilages. Situation: This is a thin muscle, of considerable breadth, situated at the lower part of the back, un- der the middle of the latissimus dorsi. Its tendon lies under that of the latissimus dorsi, but, although firmly adhering to it, is distinct, and may be separa- ted by cautious dissection. Its insertion into the ribs is situirted immediately behind the attachments con- necting the latissimus dorsi to the ribs, which attach- ments must therefore lie behind the obliquus exter- jius abdominis, and serratus posticus inferior. Use: To pvdl the ribs downwards and backwards. Synonyma: Dorso-lumbo-costah Iteflect it from the spine. The

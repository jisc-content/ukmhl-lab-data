( 214 ) CHAP. X. DISSECTION OF THE THROAT. ^~^N looking into the mouth, we observe a soft curtain hanging from the palate bones, named the Velum Pendulum Palati, or soft Palate. The apex of the velum forms a small projectingglan- dular body, teinned the Uvula, or pap of the throat. From each side of the uvula, two muscular half- arches or columns are sent down, the anterior to the root of the tongue, the posterior to the side of the pharynx. Between these half-arches on each side, are situated the glands termed Amygdale, or Tonsils. The common opening behind the anterior arch is named the Fauces, or top of the Throat, from which there are six passages, two upwards, being one to each nostril, called the Posterior Nostrils ; two at the «ides, called Eustachian Tubes, passing on each side to the ear * ; two downwards, of which the anterior is the passage through the glottis and larynx into the ♦ A probe may be introduced throngh tlie anterior nostrili into the Eustacliian tube ; the tube opens into the pharynx in a direction opposite to the space between the roots of the mid- dle and iid'arioi turbinated bouci.

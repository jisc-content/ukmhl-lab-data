( 229 ) (3.) The third branch supplies the obliquus infe- rior, and also gives oli' a twig, wiuca ussisis in form- ing the lenticular ganglion. (4.) The fourth branch supplies the adductor oculi. 3. The Nerve of the Fourth Pair, N. Patheti- cus, or Trochlearis, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and runs to the obliquus superior. 4. The first branch of the Nerve of the Fifth Pair^ named Ophthalmic, or Orbitarj, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and divides into three branches. (1.) The FuGNTAL, Supra-orbitary, or Superci- liary Nerve accompanies the frontal artery along the upper part of the orbit, close to the bone; and having "passed through the supra-orbitary notch, "is distributed to the forehead. (2.) The Nasal Nerve, or inner branch, runs towards the nose, and is distributed to the inner side of the orbit, and to the nose. (3.) The Temporal or Lacrymal Branch, supplies the lacrymal gland, and the parts at the outer side of the orbit. The Lenticular Ganglion is a small ganglion, situated within the orbit, formed by snort brandies of the ophthalmic nerve, and by a twig of the tnu'd pair. It sends off delicate nerves, which run along the sides of the optic nerve, and pierce the coats of the eye. 5.1 he second branch of the Fifth Pair, called the SuPERiou Maxillary nerve, sends off a branch through the bony canal in the bottom of the orbit.

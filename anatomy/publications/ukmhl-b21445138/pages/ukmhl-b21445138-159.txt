( 137 ) a thin medullary lamina, which is the valvula Vieus- senii, processus a cerebello ad testes, velum in>Â»;r- jectum, valvula major. The inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which descends into the middle lobe of the brain, may now be traced, by following the tract of the choroid plexus * ; in it is seen. The Hippocampus Major, or Cornu Ammoi,iis. At its commencement it is narrow, but it becomes a broad medullary projection of the floor of the ven- tricle, and its extremity, which is called Pr,s Hippo- campi, is curved inwards. The thin edge on its in- side, which follows the whole of its circuit, is named the Corpus Fimbriatum, or Tajnia Hippocampi. The posterior crus of the fornix runs along its inner and anterior part, in the form of a thin floatmg edge. In the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which passes into the posterior lobe of the brain, there is a similar medullary projection, but smaller, the Hippocampus Minor. In the anterior part of the third ventricle, below the iter ad infundibulum, are seen the Corpora Albicantia Willisii, (corpora mamillaria or sub- rotunda) two medullary eminences of the size af peas; the remainder of these bodies is seen on the outer surface of the base of the brain. This completes the demonstration of the cerebrum. The whole of the posterior lobes, and the lateral part of the middle lobes, may be removed. This exposes to your view, * Or it may be exhibited by cutting away successive slices of Uie side of the brain, until the vi;utricle is exposed. The

( 207 ) 4. The Ptekygoideus Internus—Arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the inner and upper part of the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, filling all the space between the two plates; and from the pterygoid process of the os palati between these plates. Insertedy by tendinous and fleshy fibres, into the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. Situation : 1 o expose this muscle, the jaw must be removed from its articulating cavity, and then pulled forwards, and toward the opposite side; or it may be sawn across at its symphysis, and the other half re- moved. It is larger than the pterygoideus externus; and betwixt the two muscles there is a considerable quantity of cellular membrane, and the trunk of the inferior maxillary and gustatory nerves. Like that muscle, it is concealed by the lower jaw and facial muscles. Along its posterior edge we »-bserve the Ligamentum Laterale Maxillae Inferioris, a ligamen- tous band, which extends from the back-part of the styloid process to the angle of the lower jaw. Use: To draw the jaw upwards, and obliquely towards the opposite side. Synonyma: Pterygoideus major;—Pterigo-anguli- maxillaire. . , On the side of the face is situated a considerable salivary gland, the Pakotid Gland, a large white mass, irregularly oblong and protuberant, filling up all the space betwixt the angle and ascending pro- cesses of the jaw, the mastoid processes, root of the cartilage of the ear, and zygomatic process of the temporal bone, from its anterior and upper part a white

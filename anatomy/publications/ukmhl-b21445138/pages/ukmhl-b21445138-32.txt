( 10 ) should all be cautiously removed with the scissars, along with some lymphatic glands which lie amongst the fat. Observe the order in which the parts are situated under the crural arch:—that the great exter- nal iliac vein lies next to the pubis; that the exter- nal iliac artery is on the outside of this,, in close con- tact with it;—that the anterior crural nerve is half an inch exterior to the artery, and lies on the illacus internus ; and that the outer half of the space Ifeft tinder the crural arch is filled by the psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles. Observe how the cru- ral arch is stretched over the parts just enumerated; ■—how it forms a thin, but firm, sharp and crescent- shaped edge towards the pubis (constituting the seat of stricture in the femoral hernia, and sometimes called Gimhernat's ligament) ;—how the artery is placed in relation to the angle of the pubis and spine of the ilium;—how it passes under the middle of the arch, and, before it has fairly emerged into the thigh, sends off two considerable branches. (1.) A. CiRCUMFLEXA Ilii is Sent off from the outside, passes upwards and outwards, runs along the inside of Poupart's ligament, till it arrives at the ante- rior superior spinous process ofthe os ilium; thence it is continued along the inside of the spine of the ilium, lying close upon the bone between the trans- versalis abdominis and the upper edge of the iliacus internus, to both of which it gives twigs, and ends in inosculating with the ileo-lurabar artery. That distribution, however, cannot be seen in this stage of the dissection. (2.) A, Epigastrica comes off from the inside of the

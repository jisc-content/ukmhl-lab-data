( in ) VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE POSTE- RIOR PART OF THE LEG. 1. ARTERIES. Arteria Tibialis Postica.â€”The posterior ti" bial artery, which is the continued trunk ofthe pop- liteal, sinks under the origins of the soleus, and runs down the legbetween that muscle andthemore deeply- scattered flexors of the toes: It does not lie in imme- diate contact with the fibres of the flexors, but, like the femoral artery, is invested by a strong sheath of condensed cellular membrane. It is, together with its veins and accompanying nerve, also supported by the fascia which binds down the deep-seated muscles. As it descends, it gradually advances more forwards, following the course of the flexor tendons : it passes behind the inner ankle, in the sinuosity of the os calcis, lying posterior to the lendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and anterior to that of the flexor longus pollicis. Here it is close upon the bone, and its pulsation may be iclt. It sinks Uiider the abductor pollicis, arising from the os calcis, and immediately divides into two branches: (l.j The Internal Plantar Artery is the smallest, and ramifies among the mass of muscles situated on the inner edge of the sole of the foot. (2.) TheExternal i'lantar Artery directs its course outwards, and having reached the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forms the Plantak Ahcii, which crosses the t'n-ee middic metatarsal bones obliquely, about their middle, and terminates at the space be- twixt the two first metatarsal bones, where the trunk of

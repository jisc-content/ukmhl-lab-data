( 246 ) the oblique and transverse processes of all the lum- bar vertebrae; from the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae; and from those of the cervi- cal vertebrae, excepting the three first. The fibres arising from this extensive origin pass obliquely, to be Inserted, by distinct tendons, into the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae of the loins and" back, and into those of the six inferior vertebrae of the neck. The fibres arising from each vertebrae are inserted into the second one above it, and sometimes more. Use: To extend the back obliquely, or move it to one side. When both muscles act, they extend the vertebrae backwards. Synonyma : Transversalis lumborum dorsi et colli; .—Transverso-spinalis lumborum, dorsi et colli; vel Semi-spinalis. The small muscles situated between the processes of the vertebrae are, 1. Interspinales colli, dorsi, et lumborum.— These are small bundles of fibres, which fill up the spaces between the spinous processes of the vertebra;. Each of these little muscles arises from the surface of one spinous process, and is inserted into the next spinous process. In the neck they are large, and appear double, as the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae are bi- furcated. In the back and loins they are indistinct, and are rather small tendons than muscles. Use: To draw the spinous processes nearer to each other. 2. The Inteutraksvebsales colli, dorei, et lum-

These fibres form a thin broad muscle, -which runs obliquely up- wards, and is Inserted into the skin and muscles covering the lower jaw and cheek, his muscle should be dis- sected in the course of its fibres; the skin, there- fore, must be dissected off in an oblique direction from "the clavicle to the chin. .

( .134. ) appearance of transverse lines, named Corpus Psal- loides, psalterium, or lyra. The inversion of the forniK exposes The Plexus Chokoides.—This is a continuatioa of the pia matter, a spongy mass, consisting of folds of tortuous vessels, partly covering the thalami ner- vorum opticorum, and continued into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricles. The plexus of each side is connected to its fellow by the velum interpo- situm, a membrane which passes under the fornix, 4ind lies on the third ventricle and corpora quadrige- mina. From this plexus the blood is received by the yENA Galeni situated in the middle of the velum which consists of two parallel branches ; these run backwards, unite, and enter the fourth sinus of the dura matter, called Torcular Herophili. This plexus should now be detached at its fore- part, and turned back ; it will remain as a guide to the knife in tracing the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. We now see, . The Corpora Striata, two smooth cineritious convexities, in the fore-part of the lateral ventricle, broad, and rounded anteriorly, becoming narrow, ^nd diverging as they pass backwards, consisting of medullary and cortical substance disposed in striae. The Thalami Nervorum Opticorum, two large oval whitish eminences, placed by the side of ■each other between the diverging extremities or crura of the corpora striata; towards their fore-part is a peculiar

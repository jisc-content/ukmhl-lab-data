( 295 ) llrais perforatus, but over tlic flexor profundus per- forans. It descends in the connecting cellular mem- brane, between the flexor sublirais and prol'undus; but about the middle of the lore-arm, it emerges from these muscles, and appears at the ulnar edge of the arm, betwixt the flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris. It passes over the annular ligament of the wrist, which binds down the flexor tendons of the fmgers, but is covered by the fascia which ties down the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It passes un- der the palmar aponeurosis, on the inside of the og pisiforme, reaches the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and begins to form the Supeh- nciAL Palmar Arch. This arch Hes above the tendons of the flexor sublimis perforatus, immedi- ately beneath the palmar aponeurosis. It crosses tlie metacarpal bones betwixt their bases and the middle of their bodies. It begins at the root of the little finger, and terminates at the root of the thumb, in inosculations with the branches of the radial ar- tery. The convex side of the arch is turned to- wards the fingers, and sends off five branches. (1.) A branch to tlie muscles and inner edge of the little fing6r. (2.) Ramus digitalis primus, or the first digital ar- tery, which runs along the space betwixt the two last metacarpal bones, and bifurcates into two branches, one to the outside of the little finger, and the other to the inner side of the ring-finger. (3.) The second digital artery, which bifurates in a similar manner, and supplies the outer edge of the ring-finger, and the inner side of the middle finger. (^O The third digital artery, which is distributed to

( 166 ) cles arising from the styloid process; one principal branch of it passes between tlie st ylo-pliaryngeus and stylo-glossus to the tongue, while other twigs run behind the stylo-pharyngeus, to supply the pharynx. (3.) Nervus Laryngeus Superior, vel In- ternus.—The superior or internal laryngeal nerve passes behind the internal carotid artery, obliquely, downwards and forwards; then, under the hyo-thy- roideus muscle, it plunges betwixt the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage, accompanying the laryngeal artery, and supplying the internal parts of the larynx. (4;.) In the neck, also, the par vagum gives off filaments to the cervical ganglions of the intercostal nerve, and to communicate with the other nerves of the neck. Filaments also unite with twigs of the in- tercostal, and run down over the carotid artery to the great vessels of the heart, where they form the supe- rior cardiac plexus. The par vagum enters the thorax by passing be- twixt the subclavian artery and vein. 2. The Intercostal, or Great Sympathetic Nerve.—This nerve lies behind the carotid, in the cellular membrane, betwixt that vessel and the mus- cles covering the vertebr£E of the neck. It is distin- guished from the par vagum by being smaller, lying nearer the trachea, and adliering to the muscles of the spine ; also by its forming several ganglions. It arises from the sixth pair in the cranium, and comes eut by the same foramen as the carotid artery. Immediately after its exit from the skull, it forms the Superior Cervical Ganglion, which is very long, and of a reddish colour. The nerve afterwards 1 becomes

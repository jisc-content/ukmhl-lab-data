( 20 ) every viscus, and all the connecting ligaments, are reflections or Continuations of this membrane. (1.) The FOUR Ligaments of the Liver are formed by the peritoneum, continued from the dia- phragm and parietes of the abdomen. a. The Middle or Suspensory Ligament, in- closing in its duplicate the Ligamentum Teres. b. The Coronary Ligament, connecting th« upper surface of the Liver to the diaphragm. c. The Broad Ligament of the right side, c?, The Broad Ligament of the left side. (2.) The Lesser Omentum, or Epiploon, or the Mesogastrion, is formed by two laminae of pe- ritoneum, passing from the under surface of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and contain- ing in its duplicate the vessels of the liver. (3.) The Great Epiploon or Omentum.— Observe, that the peritoneum, coming from both sur- faces of the stomach, and from the spleen, proceeds downwards into the abdomen, and is then reflected back upon itself, till it reaches the transverse arch of the colon, where its laminae separate to invest that intestine. This reflection is named the Great Omen- tum ; it is a pouch or bag, composed of four laminae of peritoneum, and the opening into it is by the Fo- ramin of Winslow: Observe the situation of this semilunar opening; it is on the right side of the ab- domen, at the root of the lesser lobe, or lobulus spi- gelii of the liver; it loads under the little epiploon, under the posterior surface of the stomach, but above the pancreas and colon, into the sac of the omentum; —the omentum sometimes reaches to the lower part of

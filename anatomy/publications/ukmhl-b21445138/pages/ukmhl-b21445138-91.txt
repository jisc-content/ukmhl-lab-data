( G9 ) ftimoris must be raised ; and then that tendon, which proceeds from the inferior spinous process, may be seen partly covered with the outer edge ofthe iliacus rnternu-s while the other tendon is exposed by raising the anterior and inferior fibres of the gluteus mini- mus. The fleshy belly, at its uppermost part is co- vered by the sartorious, and, to allow that muscle to slide over it, is tendinous ; below this, it is situated su- perficially, imraediatc4y under the fosoiae, runs down over the vasti and crurseus ; and on its posterior sur- face, where it is in contact-with those muscles, it is tendinous. Its insertion lies betwixt the two vasti. Use: To extend the leg on the thigh, and to bend the thigh on the pelvis; to bring the pelvis and thigh forwards to the leg. Synonyma : Rectus cruris;—Rectus anterior;-— Gracilis anterior;—Ilio-rotulien. Under the rectus, and partly covered by it, there Is a large mass of flesh, which, at first sight, appears to form but one muscle. It may, however, be divided into three; the separation on the external surface is not generally very evident, but, by following the course of the vessels which enter this mass, and by cutting through perhaps a few fibres externally, you will discover the line of separation ; and this separa- tion, as you proceed deeper with your dissection, will become very distinct. The three muscles are named vastus externus, vastus internus, and cruraeus : at the upper and middle parts of the thigh, they may be separated very distinctly; but for two or three inches above the condyles, they are connected inseparably. 4;.

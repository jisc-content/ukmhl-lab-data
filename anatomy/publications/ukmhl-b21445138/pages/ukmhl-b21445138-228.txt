In order to expose the following muscles, we must remove the muscles of the cheek and jaw, the mas- seter and insertion of the temporalis must be takea away, and the coronoid process of the inferior max- illa removed by a saw» ' 3. The Pterygoideus Externus—Arises, from the outer side of the external plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, from part of the tube- rosity of the OS maxillare adjoining to it, and from the root of the temporal process of the sphenoid bone. It passes backwards and outwards, to be Inserted into a depression in the neck of the con- dyloid process of the lower jaw, and into the anterior and inner part of the ligament of the articulation of that bone. Situation : This muscle passes almost transversely from the skull to its insertion. It is concealed by the muscles^f the face and neck, and by the ascend- ing processes of the lower jaw. Use: When this pair of muscles act together, they bring the jaw horizontally forwards. When they act singly, the jaw is moved forwards, and to the oppo- site side.

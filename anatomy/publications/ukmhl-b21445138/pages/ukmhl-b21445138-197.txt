( 175 ) under^he tip of the left auricle, a branch of tTie ca- ronary vein, and one of the coronary artery, ramify towards the apex of the heart, marking tlie situation of the septum cordis. The left ventricle will be found firm, fleshy, and resisting, whilst the right ventricle is more loose, and seems partly wrapt round the other. The heart is situated obliquely in the middle of the breast; its posterior surface is flat, and lies upon tlie diaphragm; its apex is turned forwards, and to- wards the left side, so, that, in the living body,-it is felt striking between the fifth and sixth ribs, at the point where the cartilages and bony extremities are -united. The Vena Cava Superiou is seen com- ing down from the upper angle of the pericardium. The Inferior Cava is seen coming up through the diaphragm; but only a very small part of this vein is covered by the pericardium ; the two veins enter the right auricle. The Right Auliicle is turned foi-- wards, and might be called the anterior; it generally appears black, by the blood shining through its thia coats. The Right Ventricle is situated almost directly opposite. The Pulmonary Artery iirisesfrom the right ventricle; its root is concealed by the right auricle; it ascends on the left side of the aorta; it divides into, 1. the right pulmonary arteryj which passes under the arch of the aorta, crosses be- hind it and the vena cava superior to the right lung, and is the longest; and, 2. the left pulmonary artery, which passes to the left lung, crossing the descend- ing aorta anteriorly. The Pulmonary Veins en- ier .the left auricle, two veins come from each lung ; ,U thÂ«

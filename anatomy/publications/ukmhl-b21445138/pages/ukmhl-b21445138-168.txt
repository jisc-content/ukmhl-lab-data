( 146 ) Medulla Spinalis, or the Spinal Marrow This part of the nervous or sensorial system must be here described, although its dissection cannot be performed till all the muscles of the back are re- moved, so that the posterior part of the spinal canal may be sawed off. The spinal canal is lined by a strong ligamentous sheath, and the dura mater is continued down upon this sheath in the form of a funnel. The spinal marrow consists externally of medullary substance, internally of cineritious. It runs down to the first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates by nu- merous filaments, which form the cauda equina.â€”It is closely embraced by the pia mater, while the tu- nica arachnoides adheres to that membrane very loosely. During the whole of its passage, there is on each side a membranous connection betwixt the pia and dura mater, by distinct slips, irregular and pointed, which connection is named Ligamentu.m Denticul atum. The arteries of the medulla may be seen running down on its anterior and posterior surfaces ; they are branches of the vertebral arter}'. The spinal accessory nerve is seen arising b}'small twigs from the posterior bundles of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves ; it then ascends along the spinal canal, enters the foramen, and passes forwards, to accompany the par vagum. The spinal marrow sends off twenty-nine pair of spinal nerves, which pass through the foramina formed betwixt the bodies of the vertebra?. They consist of seven cervical, twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and five sacral pairs of nerves.' Eacii of these nerves arise*

(. «S1 ) In this dissection we meet with twenty-two dis- tinct pair of muscles, besides a number of small muscles situated between the processes of contigu- ous vertebrse. On removing the integuments of the posterior part of the neck and back, v/e expose, 1. The Trapezius—It arises, by a thick round tendon, from the lower part of the protuberance in the middle of the os occipitis behind, and, by a thin tendinous expansion, from the superior transverse ridge of that bone ; from the five superior cervical spinous processes by the ligaraentum nuchse; ten- dinous, from the two inferior cervical spinous pro- cesses, and from the spinous processes of ail the ver- tebrae of the back, i'he fleshy fibres coming from the neck descend obhquJy, while those from the back ascend. Inserted^ fleshy, into the posterior third part of the clavicle ; tendinous and fleshy, into tUe acromion, and into the upper edge of all the spine of the sca- pula. The fibres sliae over a triangular surface at the extremity of the spine of that bone. aituation : This muscle is quite superficial, and conceals all the muscles situated in the posterior part of the neck, and upper part of the back. It adheres to its fellow the whole length of its origin. Its an- terior hbres lie posterior to those of the sterno-mas- toideus, but are not in contact with them, a consi- derable quantity Of adipose substance being inter- posed. The posterior cervical ligaments, (ligamentuoi nuchae vel colli,; is a ligament which arises trom the middle of the occipital bone, runs down on the back-

( 131 ) the middle of die os pariettile; it Is termed Fissuka Cerebri, or fissiu-a !Magna Silvii. By gently separating with the lingers the two he- ziiLspheres of the brain *, we see passing betwixt them a longitudinal white convex body, the Corpus Cal- LosuM : it lies under the falx, incurvates downwards at both its extremities, and is continued anteriorly into the medullary substance betwixt the corpora striata, posteriorly into the fornix and inferior corriu •of the lateral ventricle on each side. On the surface of the corpus callosum is seen the Raphe, formed by two longitudinal medullary lines united by trans- verse fibres. When the brain is cut horizontally on the level of the corpus callosum, an appearance is produced, termed The Medullary arch, or Centrum Ovale. Under this arch are the two lateral ventriclest. If ■one of these be cautiously perforated on the side of the corpus callosum, and gently inflated by a blow- pipe, its extent may be seen ; but, if much farce be used, the air will pass into the other ventricle. The two ventricles are separated by a medullary partition, which descends from the inferior surface of the corpus callosum to the fornix, the Septum LuDicuM ; it consists of two lamina;, with a narrow * Between the hemisphereg and on the surface of the corpus callosum, we observe the arteriae coliosa, which are the couti- nuation of the truuks of the anterior cerebri. t To show the lateral ventricles, the corpus callosum should be cut away close to the septum iucidum, and then the ventricle of that body, and the thickness and breadth of the septum itself, will be more clearly seen.

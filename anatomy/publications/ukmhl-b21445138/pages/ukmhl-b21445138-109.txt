{ 8' ) beIo\r the insertion of the gluteus maximus; and from the oblique ridge running to the outer condyle, where it is connected with the fibres of the vastus ex- ternas. The two lieads unite at an acute angle, a little above the external condyle, and terminate in a strong tendon, which is Inserted into a rough surface on the outside of the head of the fibula. Situafion: The long head of this muscle is con- cealed at its upper part by the inferior fibres of the gluteus maximus ; below this, it is situated quite su- perficial, immediately under the f.^scia, running from the pelvis to the knee between the vastus cxternus and semitendinosus, and forming the outer ham- string.—The short head is partly concealed by the long head, its fibres arise from the linea aspera, be- tween those of the adductor magnus and vastus ex- ternus ;—it forms the outer hamstring. Use: To bend the leg, and particularly by means of its shorter head to twist the leg outwards in the bent state of the knee. Synoiiyma : Biceps cruris ;—Ischio-femoro-pero- nien. 10. The Semitendinosus — Arises, tendinous, in common with the long head of the biceps, from the tuberosity of the ischium; it has also some fleshy fibres arising from that projection more outwardly :—as it descends, it arises, for two or three inches, fleshy,from the inside of the tendon of the biceps ; forms a thick belly, and terminates at the distance of three or four inches from the knee in a long round tendon, which, becoming

( 236 ) nous processes of the three inferior cervical vertebrjjp, and of the two .superior dorsal. Inserted, by distinct lleshy slips, into the second, third, fourth, and sometimes the fifth ribs, a little be- yond their angle. Situation : Tliis muscle is concealed by the rhora- boideus and scapula, except a few of its superior fibres, which appear above the upper edge of the rhomboideus minor. It covers part of the origin of the splenius. Use : To elevate the rib', and dilate the thorax. Synonyjna : Cervici dorso-costal. Reflect it from the spine. 7. The Splenius is divided into two portions: (1.) The Splenius Capitis—Arises^ tendinous, from the spinous processes of the two superior dorsal, and five inferior cervical vertebrae. It forms a flat broad muscle, which ascends obliquely, and is inserted^ ten- dinous, into the posterior part of the mastoid process, and into a small part of the os accipitis, immediately below its superior transverse ridge. Situation: This muscle is covered by the trapezius, and by the insertion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and a small part of it is seen on the side of the neck betwixt those two muscles. The lower part of its origin is covered by the serratus superior posticus. Reflect it from the occiput. (2.) The Splenius Colli—/im^'^, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes thesixt'.i dorsal vertebrae. It formsa small fleshy belly, which ascends by the side of the verte- bras, and is inserted mto the transverse processes of the

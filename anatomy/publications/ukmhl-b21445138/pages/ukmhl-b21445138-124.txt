( 102 ) close upon the middle of the interosseous ligament, between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis; below the middle of the leg, it leaves the interosseous ligament, and passes gradually more for- wards ; it crosses under the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis*, and is then situated between that tendon, and the first tendon of the extensor longus digitorum : at the ankle it runs over the fore-part of the tibia, being now situated more superficially ; then over the astragalus and os naviculare, and over the Junction of the os cunieforme internum and medium; crossing under that tendon of the extensor brevis di- gitorum which goes to the great toe.—Arriving at the space between the bases of the two first metatarsal bones, it plunges into the sole of the foot, and imme- diately joins the plantar arch. BRANCHES. 1. A. Eecurrens, which ramifies over the fore- part of the knee, inosculating with the articular arteries. 2. Numerous twigs to the tibialis anticus, extensor pollicis, and other muscles on the fore part of the leg. 3. A. Malleolaris Interna ramifies over the inner ankle, and inosculates with the perineal and posterior tibial arteries. 4. The External Malleolar ramifies over the outer ankle. ♦ It is crossed by that tendon just above the lower head of the tibia, while under the annular ligament. 5. The

Tiie internal or anterior interosseous artery tlejcends close upon tlie middle of tlie interosseous li- gament, betwixt the flexor longus poUicis and flexor profundus perforans, giving twigs to tlic adj.icent nniscles. Arriving at the up])cr edge of the pronator qiiadratus, it perforates betwixt the radius ani ulna to the back-part of the arm, and spreads its extreme jbrnnches on the wrist and back of the hand. VEINS. The cutaneous veins have been already described. The brachial arterj' is accompanied by tivo veins, named Venae Comites, or Satellites. These i-eceive branches corresponding to the ramificatious of the artery. NERVES. In the dissection of the asilla, we demonstrated thft greataxillary plexus, and traced its two fia-st branches, the external scapular and circumflex nerves. Tlie distribution of the five remaining branches of the plexus must now be described. .-. (3.) The External CiT'fAyKOUs Nerve, (Mus- Cufo-cutaneus, or Perforans Casscrii,) is the third branch of the axillary plexus. It passes through the ])clly of the caraco-brachiatis muscle. Alter its pas- sage it continues its course obliquely across the arm, betwixt the Biceps flexor cnbiti and the Brachialis internus. It gives twigs to these muscles, and appears as a superficial nerve on the edge of the supinator longus. It runs over the cute- 'Condyle, and is dis- tributetl

At first it lies ver}' superticial, betwixt the skin and fascia, and in- vohed in the intermediate cellular membrane. As it ascends, it is gradually enveloped by the fibres of the fascia, and then sinks beneath it to join the femoral vein about an inch below Poupart's ligament:—In its course it is joined by several cutaneous veins. 2. Immediately under the true skin, and more su- perficial than the veins or nerves, you may occasion- ally perceive the Lymphatic Vessels running, like lines of a whitish colour, to enter the inguinal glands: they are more numerous on the fore-part, than on the outside of the thigh. 3. Several Cutaneous Nerves are seen ramify- ing above the fascia. They all come from the lumbar or anterior crural nerve, pierce the fascia about the lower part of the abdomen and groin, and are distri- buted to the groin, and integuments on the fore- part of the thigh. The fascia may now be exposed distinctl-y. Ob- serve how extensively it arises from tlie bones, ten- dons, and ligaments. On the anterior and superior part of the thigh, it arises from Poupart's ligament *„ from * At this part the fascia of the tliigh Is covered by a mure superficial expanjioii^ wliich lies over the lower part of the apcniLurosis of the exieraai obliq^ue muscle, completely covers, ibc crural arcl), and descends some little way beyond the bend ufthelhlgb.

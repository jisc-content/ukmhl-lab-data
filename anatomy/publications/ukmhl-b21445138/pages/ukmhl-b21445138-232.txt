( 2ro ) nerve and one or two veins. (3.) A. Pterygoidcae and A. Temporales Prol'undtB, are small branches of the internal muxillary which pass to the pterygoid muscles, and to the inner part of the temporal mus- cle. (4.) A Pharyngeae, branches to the phaiynx, palate, and base of the skull. (5.) A. Alveolaris, which gives brcmches to the teeth of the upper jaw, and to the jaw bone itself. (6.) A Branch through the foramen spheno-palatinum to the nose; and, (7.) An Artery through the palato-maxiilary canal to the palate. The continued trunk of the internal maxillary en- ters the orbit by the spheno-maxillai-y slit. It sends off a branch which runs along the inner side of the orbit, and passes out at the inner canthus of the eye on the forehead.. The artery itself runs along the boitorn of the orbit in a canal on the upper part of the great tuberosity of the os maxillare superius, and emerges by the foramen infra-orbitarium on the face; hence it is termed A. Infra-Orbitaria, and is distributed to the cheek and side of the nose. The Frontal Artery is also seen in the dissec- tion of the face, passing from the orbit through the foramen supra-orbitarium to be distributed to the forehead. This artery is sent off from the ophthal- mic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid. If the face be injected, a remarkable anastomosis of arteries will be observed at the inner angle of the eye. VEINS.

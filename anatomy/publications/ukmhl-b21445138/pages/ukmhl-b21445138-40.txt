( 18 ) c.to Pubis, ami two lateral, named Inguinal regions. Make a longitudinal incision from the scrobi- culus cordis to the umbilicus, and from that point an oblique incision on each side towards the ante- rior spinous process of the os ilium, forming thuE three triangular flaps. In doing this, avoid cutting the intestines, by raising the muscles from them after the first puncture. Before you disturb the viscera, observe the gene- ral situation of those parts which appear on the first opening of the abdomen. 1. The internal surface of the PERiT0NE;>5f, smooth, shining, and colourless, covering thg^' pa- rietes of the abdomen, and the surface of i.i-tlis viscera. ' 2. In the triangular portion of integumen^ folded down over the pubes, three ligamentous cords pro- ject through the peritoneum, two running laterally, and the other in the middle, towards the navel. 'J'hese are the remains of the two umbilical arteries and the urachus. 3. The epigastric artery, accompanied by two veins, may be seen through the peritoneum, ascend- ing obliquely upwards and inwards from under Pou- part's ligament. <t. The upper edge of the liver is seen extending from the right hypochondriac region, across the epigastric, into the left hypochondriac region ; in it a fissure is seen, into which enters, inclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, the ligamcntum teres, which was, in the foetus, the umbilical vein.

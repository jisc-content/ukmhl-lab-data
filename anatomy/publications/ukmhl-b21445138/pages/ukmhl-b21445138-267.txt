Obliquus Capitis Inferior—Arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the side of the spinous pro- cess of the dentata or second cervical vertebra. It forms a tliick belly, and is Inserted into the under and back-part of the trans- verse process of the atlas. Situation: This muscle is obliquely situated be- tween the two first vertebrae of the neck. It is covered by the complexus and trachelo-mastoideus^ except a small part which is seen between these two muscles, and is concealed by the splenius. Its origin lies between the origin of the rectus capitis posticus., major, and the superior insertion of the semi-spinalis colli- Use : To rotate the head, by turning the first ver, tebra upon the second, Sijnonyma: Obliquus inferior, sive Major ; — Spini- ax oido-tracheli-atloidien. 22. The MuLTiFiDus SpinjE- On removing the muscles of the spine which have been described, we find situated beneath them the Multifidus Spinse. It is that mass of muscular flesh which lies close to the spinous and transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae, extending from the dentata to the OS sacrum. The bundles of which it is com- posed seem to pass from the transverse, to be in- serted into the spinous processes.

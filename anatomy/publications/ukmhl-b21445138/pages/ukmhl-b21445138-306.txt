Each tendorr splits at the extremity of the first pluilanx, for the passage of the tendon of the flexor profundis per- foratus, and inserted into the base af the second phalanx. Under the flexor subHmis are the four tendons of" the flexor profundus pcrforans, which pass through the shts in tlie tendons of the former, and are in- serted into the bases of the third phakmges of the fingers. The LuMEniCALEs are four small muscles, whicit arise, tendinous and flesliv, fron) the outer side of thv* tendons cf the flexor profLUiduu pcrforans, soon after those tendons have passed the ligavnentum cnrpl annulare. Each of the«e musch.'s has a small belly, which terminates in a tendon. The tendon run» along the outer edge of the finger, and is Inserted into the tendinous expansion \Yhich covers, the back-part of the phalanges of the fingers, about the middle of the first joint. Use: To bend the first phalanges of the fingers, the flexor profundus being previously in action, to afi'ord them a fixed point. Synonyma: Annuli-tcndino-phalangiens.

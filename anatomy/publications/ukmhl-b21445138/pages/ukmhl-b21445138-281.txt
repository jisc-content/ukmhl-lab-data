( '^59 } to reach the place of their insertion, Tlicy appear at first inseparably united, but on dividing them with some care, we find an intermediate cavity lubricated with synovia. The tendon of the latissimus dorsi is anterior to the tendon of the teres major ; but the lower edge of the latter extends farther down the arm. Use: To roll the humerus inwards, and to dtaw it backwards and downwards. Synonyma : Anguli-scapulo-humeral. 6. The SuBSCAPULARis—^me*, fleshy, from all the baae of the scapula internally, from the superior and inferior costae, and from tlie whole internal sur- face of the bone. It consists of tendinous and fleshy bundles, which converge, slide over the inner surface of the neek of the scapula, pass in the hollow under the root of the coracoid process, and adhere to the inner part of the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint. Inserted, by a strong tendon, into the lesser tube- rosity near the head of the os humeri. Situation : The whole of this muscle is concealed by the scapula and muscles of the shoulder. It lies betwixt that bone and the serratus magnus. The tendon passes under the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps flexor, to reach the lesser tubero- sity : The lower edge of this muscle is in contact with the upper edge of tTie teres major. Use: To roll the os humeri inwards, and to draw it to the side of ^he body. Synonyma: Sus-scapulo-trochinien. 7. The Biceps Flexor Cubiti—Arises by two heads. The first and outermost, called the Long Head,

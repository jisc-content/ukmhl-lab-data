( 41 ) From the ganglion, on each side, branches are sent across, which communicate intimately toge- ther, and form round the root of the coeliac artery, a very intimate plexus, containing several ganglia of various sizes, formerly called the Solau, but now more correctly the Cceliac Plexus. Nerves pass from this plexus, with the branches of the aorta,- to the various viscera of the abdomen: in a common dissection these nerves cannot be clearly demonstrated, as they lie very close on the re- spective arteries, and are surrounded by much con- densed cellular substance; they form the hepatic, eplenic, superior, and inferior mesenteric, renal, and spermatic plexuses, 3. The trunk of the intercostal nerve, the poste- rior intercostal, perforates the small muscle of the diaphragm close to the spine, runs down on the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and along the upper edge of the psoas magnus. It terminates on the extremity of the os coccygis, by union with the nerve of the opposite side, in a ganglion named Ganglion Impar. In this course, it communi- cates with the lumbar nerves, and the various ab- dominal plexuses. The Thoracic Duct may be seen passing front the abdomen into the thorax, between the aorta and the right crus of the diaphragm. It is larger here than in its subsequent course, and the dilated portion is called receptaculum chyliy as the lacteal* pour in the chyle in this situation. CHAP.

It descends along the back-part of the for arm, and adheres to the ulna where it passes over it. The fleshy belly terminates in four flat tendons, which pass under the annular ligament in a depres- sion on the back-part of the radius, and are Inserted into the posterior part of all the bones of the fingers by a tendinous expansion.

The tendons are connected on the back of the metacarpal bone, by cross slips.— The inner part of this muscle is sometimes described as a separate muscle, and is called Extensor Pro- prius Minimi Digiti, vcl Auricularis.

( 68 ) vaginre femoris, and the outer attachment of Pou- part's ligament, and above the anterior fibres of the iliacus internus. It lies before the muscles of the thigh, crossing thtm like a strap about two inches in breadth ; it runs down for some space upon the rectus femoris, passes over the vastus internus, and then over the triceps adductor longus. At the lower part of the thigh, it runs between the tendon of the triceps adductor magnus, and that of the gracilis.-— In all this course, it is firmly bound down by the common fascia of the thigh. It is inserted above tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, over which it sends an aponeurotic expansion. Use To bend the leg obliquely inwards on the thigh, and to bend the thigh forwards. Synonyma: Longissimus femoris;— Ilio-creti-tibiaK 3.The Rectus Femoris—Arises, by a strong ten- don, from the inferior anterior spinous process of the OS ileum ; and, by another strong tendon, from the dorsum of that bone a little above the acetabu- lum, and from the capsular ligament of the hip joint. The two tendons soon unite, and send off a large belly, which runs down over the anterior part of the thigh, forming a complcto penniform muscle, and terminates in a flat but strong tendon, which is Inserted into the upper extremity of the patella; where a thin aponeurosis is sent from it over the fore-part of that bone, to terminate on the strong li- gament which connects the lower part of the patella to the tibia, and is called Ligamentum Patella;. Situation : To expose the tendinous origins of thij muscle, the origins of the sartorius and tensor vaginae femorU

It receives a number of fibres from a muscle belonging to it, viz, the tensor vaginae femo- tis, and from the tendon of the gluteus-muximus;— it passes down over the whole thigh, is firmly fixed to the linea aspera, to the condyles of the femur, and to the patella,—and is continued over the knee, to be attached to the heads of the tibia and fibula, after which it forms the fascia of the leg. On the upper and anterior part of the thigh, there is a slight hollow, where the great vessels descend under the crural arch. The fascia lata forms just on. the outside and upper part of this, a crescent-shaped fold, called its semilnmir edge, which is stronglj' con- nected to the crural arch, and sometimes contri- butes to the strangulation in femoral hernia. The fasci^ should now be dissected back ; and in lifting up the thicker part of it, which covers the outside of the thigh, you may observe that it is com- posed of two laminae of fibres : The fibres of the outer lamina run in circles round the thigh, while those on the inside, which are stronger, and more firmly connected, run longitudinally.

( 108 ) membranous fascia is seeii connecting and investin* them, which is to be removed. This fascia also covers the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, but the description of the course of these vessels, though seen in this stage of the dissection, must be deferred. The deep-seated muscles are, 1 he Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis; situated be- hind the tibia. The Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis, situated behind the fibula. The Tibialis Posticus, vrhich is althost concealed by the two other muscles, and by the fascia, which connects them, and binds them down. 5. The Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis Per- TORANSâ€”'Arises, fleshy, from the posterior flattened surface of the tibia, between its internal and external angles, below the attachment of the soleus, and con- tinues to arise from the bone to within two or three inches of the ankle ; the fibres pass obliquely into a tendon which is situated on the posterior edge of the muscle. This tendon runs behind the inner ankle in a groove of the tibia, passes mider a stror g ligament Mhich goes from the inner ankle to the os calcis, and having veceived a strong tendinous slip from the flexor poilicis longus, divides about the middle of the sole of the foot into four tendons, which pass through the slits in the tendon of the flexor digitorum brevis, and are Inserted into the extremity of the last joint of the four lesser toes. Situation : The belly of this muscle is concealed by the soleus, and lies on the inside of the flexor longus t pollicis.

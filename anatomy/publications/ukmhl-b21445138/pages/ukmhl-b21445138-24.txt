i 2 ) 3. In dissecting muscular parts, the muscles should be extended; the cellular membrane, which connects them to the integuments, should be placed on the stretch, and entirely removed with the skin ; the knife should be kept close to the muscles, and carried steadily in the direction of their fibres, separating a fasciculus at each stroke :â€”thus the exposed surface will appear clean, and the course of the fibres dis- tinct. 4:. When small vessels are to be demonstrated, another method is to be follow ed; the skin only must be removed, and the cellular membrane cautiously and slowly dissected from the vessels. 5. During dissection, every little operation should be practised, which can give the dexterity of hand so essential to the surgeon ; such are, the use of the catheter and probang, the introduction of a probe through the nose into the Eustachian tube, or nasal duct, and the cutting down to the various arteries, which may become the object of surgical operations; as the external iliac, femoral, anterior and posterior tibial, brachial, radial, and ulnar, &c. The grand object of the surgical student is to ac- quire a knowledge of the relative situation of parts. This should be kept in view in all his anatomical labours. Hence, when he is dissecting the muscles, he should carefully expose the chief blood vessels and nerves ; and attentively consider their position with regard to each other, and to the surrounding parts. This species of knowledge will afford him the most essential assistance in his future operations on the living subject; in which indeed it is so necessar}', that

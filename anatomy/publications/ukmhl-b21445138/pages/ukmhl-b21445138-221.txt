( 199 ) a number of thin separate fibres run up obliquely along the cartilage of the nose towards the dorsum nasi, where the muscle joins its fellow, and is Inserted, slightly, into the lower part of the os nasi and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Situation: It is superficial; its origin is con- nected with tlie levator labii superioris alseque nasi; and its upper part with some of the descending fibres of the occipito-frontalis. Use: To compress the ala towards the septum nasi; but, if the fibres of the occipito-frontalis, which adhere to it, act, the upper part of this mus- cle assists in pulling thfe ala outwards : It also cor- rugates the skin of the nose. Synonyma: Transversalis seu myrtiformis;—Dila- tores alarum nasi;—Constrictor nasi;—Maxillo-na- rinal.- 4f. Levator Labii Superioiiis Al^que Nasi —Arises by two distinct origins ; the first from the nasal process of the superior ma>:illary bone, where it joins the os frontis at tue inner can'hus of the eye; it descfends along the nasal process, and is inse ted into the outer part of the ala na^i, and into the upper h'p.—The second arises, broad and fleshy, from the external orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the foramen infra-orbila- rium; it runs down, becoming narrower, and is inserted mto the upper lip and orbicularis oris. Situation: The first portion is sometimes called Levator Labii Superioris Ateque Nasi, and the se-- cond Levator Labii Superioris Proprius. Their ori- gins are partly covered by the orbicularis palpebra- I 4) rum«

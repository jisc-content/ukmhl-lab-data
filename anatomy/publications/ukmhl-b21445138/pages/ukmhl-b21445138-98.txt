( 76 ) the adductor brevis, where tliat muscle project? be- twixt the pectinalis and adductor longus; the whole of the adductor loiigus, and about an inch of the adductor magnus: It then slips betwixt the tendon of the adductor map-nus and the bone, and. enterin": the ham, becomes the Popliteal artery. To find the arteiy in any part of its course from the crural arch to the tendinous opening, turn out the foot, ascertain the place of that vessel at the crural arch according to the above description, and then draw a straight line downwards.—In this course, it has the belly of the vastus internus situated on its outside; it lies between the origin of that muscle, and the tendinous insertion of the muscles over which it crosses; and there is a strong interlacing of the tendinous fibres, forming a deep groove for the artery ; it is also invested by a firm sheath, which consists of condensed cellular mem- brane, intermixed with some tendinous fibres:—For some inches below Poupart's ligament, this artery is on its fore-part only covered by cellular substance, absorbent glands, and the general fascia of the thigh; but, meeting with the inclined line of the sartorius, it is, during the rest of its course, covered by that muscle. It perforates the teudon of the adductor magnus, at the distance of rather more than one-third of the length of the bone from its lower extremity. Observe that in popliteal aneurism the artery may be taken up either at the upper or iimer, the lowet or outer, margin of the Sartorius, or immediately behind that muscle : of v.-hich situations the first is the best, the second next best, and the third by far the least eligible, .

The Capsule Renales.—Two glandular bo- dies, situated on the upper extremity of each kidney, of an irregular figure, crescent-like, or somewhat ■triangular. By the removal of the peritoneum, several muscles are exposed, situated at the superior and posterior parts of the abdomen. One single muscle is situated in the superior part of the abdomen. DiAPHRAGMA, the DiAPHRAGM, Or MiDRIFF.— This is a broad, thin, muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, situated obliquely; it is con- cave below, and convex above, the middle of it on each side reaching as high within the thorax as the fourth rib. It is divided into two portions: 1. The superior or greater muscle of thediaphragm, forms the transverse partition between the chest and abdomen. Arising, by distinct fleshy fibres, 1. From the pos- terior surface of the ensifovm cartilage; 2. Frura the cartihiges of the seventh, and all the false ribs; S. From the ligamentum arcuatum, which is a liga- ment extended, somewhat indistinctly, from the top of the twelfth rib to the lumbar vertebrae, forming an arch over the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles.

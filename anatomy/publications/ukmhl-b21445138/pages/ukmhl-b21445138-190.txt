( 1G8 ) Branches.—While the nerve is passing betwixC the jugular vein and the carotid artery, it sends oiTthe Descendens Noni.—This small and delicate nerve descends on the fore-part of the vein and artery, and is distributed to the muscles on the anterior part of the trachea. It is joined by filaments of the cervical nerves. 4. The Lingual Branch sent off by the third bi-anch of the fifth pair of nerves, is also seen in the dissection of the neck. It is found under the mylo- hyoideus; it lies close upon the lower edge of the jaw-bone, betwixt the inferior edge of the pterygoi- deus internus and the upper part of the mylo-hyoi- deus. It gives numerous twigs to the sublingual gland and submaxillary duct, which are situated near it, and is lost in the substance of the tongue. 5. Nervus Accessorius ad par Vagum.—The accessory nerve, having passed out of the cranium with the parvaginum, separates from it, passesbehind the internal jugular vein obliquely downwards and backward; it perforates the mastoid muscle, and is distributed to the trapezius and muscles about the shoulder; it is much connected with the third and fourth cervical nerves. 6. The Seven Cervical Nerves come out from the foramina betwixt the vertebrse of the neck. They send numerous branches to the muscles, &c. on the side of the neck, and communicate by filaments with all the other nerves in the neck. In this stage of the dissection, we may also see, 7. The Phrenic Nerve, formed by branches •f the third and fourth cervical nerves.—This small nerve

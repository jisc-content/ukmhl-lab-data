( 57 ) from the groins; it consists of the commo» integu- ments, with an aiklitional quantity of celluhir and adipose substance,.and lies upon the fore-part of the ofisa pubis. From the inferior part of the mons veneris arise The Labi a Externa, called also the labia or alse pudendi: they are continued downwards and forwards in the direction of the symphysis pubis, and terminate in the perineum anterius : they consist of integuments, cellular substance, and fat,—are thicker above than below,—and are red and vascular on their inner side. The places where the labia are joined to each other above and below, are termed Commis- sures. The longitudinal cavity or fissure, situated betwixt the labia, and extending from the mons veneris to the perineum anterius, is sometimes called the Sinus PuDORis; it is broader above than below, and con- tains several other parts. On separating the labia, we see, immediately below the superior ccmmissure, The CiiTOKis, a red projecting body, situated be- low the arch of the pubis, and partly covered by its Prepuce : The prepuce is a fold of skin, continued from the inner surface of the labia, so as to cover the superior and lateral part of the clitoris.—The clitoris resembles the penis of the male, and consists of two cavernous bodies ; these, however, cannot be traced in this stage of the dissection. That part of the body which forms an obtuse projection external!/, is called the Gl.-vns. The Perineum Anterius is that portion of the c 5 soft

This expansion is named the Fascia Lata Fe- MORis; it consists partly of tendinous, pavtly of li- gamentous fibres; it surrounds and covers all the muscles, and sends septa or partitions betvveea them :â€”It is very strong, smooth, and tendinous on the outer part of the thigh ; but, on the antt i :or and, inner part, it is very thin, and of a cellular texture.

( 235 ) fleshy digitations, from the nine superior ribs. These tligitijtions are seen on tlie anterior part of the tho- rax ; they pass obliquely backwards, and form a strong fleshy muscle. Inserted, principally fleshy, into the whole of the base of the scapula. Siluation : This muscle lies between the scapula and the ribs, so that, to see its course, the articula- tion of the clavicle to the sternum should be divided, and the scapula lifted from the trunk. It is concealed by the latissimus dorsi, by the two pectoral muscles, and the scapula. The only part of it which can be seen before the removal of those muscles, projects betwixt and below them on the side of the trunk. 1 he lower digitations, which pass more anteriorly than tke edge of the latissimus dorsi, are intermixed with the superior digitations of the obliquus externus abdominis. The superior digitations arise behind the pectoralis minor. The insertion of the muscle is between the subscapularis, which arises from the internal surface of the scapula, and the insertions of the rhomboideus and levator scapulae. Use : To move the scapula forwards, and, w^hen the scapula is forcibly raised, to draw the ribs up- wards. St/noni/ma: Serratus major anticus;â€”Costo-basi- scapulaire *. I he removal of the rhomboideus also exposes, 6. The Serratus Superior Posticus. This muscle arises^ by a thin broad tendon, from the spi- * i he upper extremity may bow be removed from the trunk. nous

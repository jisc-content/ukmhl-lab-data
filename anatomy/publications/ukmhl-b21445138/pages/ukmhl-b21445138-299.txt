( 277 ) Inserted a tendinous expansion which is formed by tlic lew- dons of the common extensor, of the lumbricales, and interossei. Tiiis tendinous expansion terminates in the tlu'rd or extreme phalanx. 5. The Extensor Carpi Ulnauis —^7?ii<?.?, tendinous, from tlic upper part of the external con- dj'le ; flesh}', from the intermuscular ligaments and inside of the fascia. It crosses towards the ulna, and arises, fleshy, from the back-part of that bone. It terminates in a strong tendon, which passes through u groove in the back-part of the.lower end of the ulna, under the annular ligament, and is Inserted into the posterior and upper part of the 'metacarpal bone of the little finger. Sitiififion : This muscle is entirely superficial. It arises from the condyle betwixt the extensor digito- rum communis and anconeus. It descends along the fore-arm betwixt the extensor digitorum communis and flexor carpi ulnaris. Wse : To extend the wrist, and bring the hand backwards ; but chiefly to bend the hand laterally towards the ulna, as it will appear by pulling its ten- don in the dissected subject. Sijnomjma : Ulnaris externus;—Epicondilo-cubi- to-sus-metacarpien. 6. The Anconeus is, a small triangular muscle, situated at the outer side of the olecranon, imme- diately under the integuments. It arhes, tendinous, from the posterior and lower part of the external condyle of the os humeri; forms a thick triangular fleshy mass, adhering to the cap- sular ligament of the elbow joint, and is

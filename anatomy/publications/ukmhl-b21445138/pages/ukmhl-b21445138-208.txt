( 186 ) from the clavicle as low as tbe edge of the tendon of ilie latissiiuus dorsi, and which surrounds the axil- lary artery with its meshes. From the axillary plexus seven nerves pass ofF. 1. NiiRvus SuPiiA-scAPULARis, Scapularis Ex- ternus, Scapularis.—This nerve comes off from the upper edge of the plexus : it crosses the axilla at the highest part, runs towards the superior costa of the scapula, accompanies the external scapular ar- tery through the semilunar notch, and supplies the muscles on the posterior surface of the scapula, 2. N. CiRCUMFLEXUSp Articularis, Axillaris, or Humeralis, lies deep: it passes from the back-part the plexus, goes backwards round the neck of the bone, accompanying the posterior circumflex artery, and is distributed to the musculus deltoides, •and the muscles on the outside of the arm. Small nerves also pass from the axillary plexus to the sub- scapular muscle, the teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoral muscles. 3. The External Cutaneous Nerve, or Nervus- Musculo-cutaneus. 4. The Radial Nerve, 5. The Ulnar Nerve, 6. The Muscular or Spiral Nerve, 7. The Internal Cutaneus Nerve. These five nerves will be described in the dissec- tion ef the arm and fore-arm. SECT

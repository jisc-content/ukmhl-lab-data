( m ) arises In two fasciculi, one from the fore-part, the other from the back-part, of the spinal marrow; these fascicuH penetrate the dura mater separately ; the posterior bundle forms a ganglion, and afterwards unites with the anterior fasciculus, to form the nerve. A general view of the distribution of the spinal nerves may be usefully subjoined in this place, to complete the description of the nerves. 1. The Cervical Nerves consist of seven pairs; they spread their branches over the side of the neck, and to the muscles moving the head and shoulders. The superior nerves send branches to the side of the head, and the inferior to the upper part of the chest and back. They also communicate freely with each other, and with all the neighbouring nerves;—high in the neck, and under the jaw, with the portio dura of the seventh pair, with the fifth, eighth, and ninth, pairs, and with the great sympathetic;—towards the middle of the neck, with the descendens noni, the sympathetic and eighth pair, and in the lower part of the neck with the sympathetic. The Phrenic Nerve is formed b}'- branches of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, passes obliquely down the neck through the thorax, then on each side of the pericardium, and is distributed to the diaphragm. The Axillary Plexus is formed by the princi- pal parts of the trunks of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical, and first dorsal nerves. 2. The Dorsal Nerves are twelve pairs.—They arise from the spinal marrow in the same manner as the cervical. Each nerve emerges betwixt the heads G 2 of \

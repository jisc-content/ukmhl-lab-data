Tlie tendon runs along the radius, and, !)econiing rounde.-, passes througli a grove in tlie b.ick-part of the in- ferior cxtrenn'ty of tliat bone, to bo Inserted into the posterior and upper part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger. Siluntiofi: The belly lies under the supinator Ion- gus, but part of it projects behind that muscle. The tendon descend)^ behind that of the supinator, and passes under the extensors of the thumb, and annu- lar ligament of the wrist, to arrive at the place of itsiinsertion. Use: To extend the wrist, and move the hand backwards, and to assist in bending the fore- arm. _ Sijnonyina: Radialis externus longior;—Radialis externus primus ;—Humero-sus-metacarpien. ?>.

Its thick belly runs along tlie outside of the radius, and terminates in a tendon, which passes , through the same groove in the radius as the extensor radialis longior, and under the annular ligament. Inserted, by a round te'ndon, into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone that supports the middle finger. Situation: This muscle lies partly under the ex. tensor radialis longior; but it also projects behind it. The tendon is seen behind, or more inwardly than M G the

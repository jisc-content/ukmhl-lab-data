( 50 ) 8. The Corpora Cavernosa Penis arise, on each side, by a process named the Crus, from the ramus and from the tuber ischii, ascend along the ischium and pubis, and are united immediately before the cartilaginous arch of the pubis;—they are covered by a strong, white, shining, fibrous, ligamento-ten- dinous substance, which is very elastic. Internally they are cavernous, and are separated from each other by a septum, which, from being perforated, is named Septum pectiniforme. By the union of the two corpora cavernosa, two grooves are formed:—(1.) A smaller one above, in which two arteries pass, a large vein or two betwixt them, and some large twigs of nerves. (2.) A larger groove below, which receives the urethra. 9. The Vesica Urinaria, or Urinary Blad- der, is situated within the pelvis, immediately behind the ossa pubis, and before the rectum. It is covered on its upper and back part by a reflection of peritoneum; in front and below (where it is con- tiguous to the rectum), it is connected by cellular membrane to the surrounding parts. Shape, oval, but flattened before and behind, and, while in the pelvis, somewhat triangular. Divided into the fundus or bottom, corpus or bodv, and cervix or neck. In the contracted state, the fundus is the broadest and roundest part, but, when distended, the cervix is broader than any other part. At the top of the blad- der, above the symphysis pubis, may be observed, the superior ligament of the bladder, consisting of the UrachiiSy a ligamentous cord, which runs up between the peritoneum and linea alba, as far as the nave!, I

( 273 ) Inserted into the lower and anterior part of the radius. Situation: This muscle lies close to the bones, covered by the flexor longus pollicis and flexor digi- torum suhlimis. Use : To turn the radius, together with the hand, inwards, Synonyma: Cubito-radial. MUSCLES SITUATED 0^ THE OUTER AND BACK PART OF THE FOKE-ARM, AND ARISING FROM THE OUTER CONDYLE OF THE OS HUMERL These muscles are eleven in aumber, and may be * divided-intci two classes: 1. The Superficial; and, 2. The deep-seated. THE SUPERFICIAI/^. The muscles which arise from the outer condyle are much more distinct in their origins than those which arise from the inner condyle. Several of them arise a considerable way up the os humeri; but there is here also a common tendinous origin, from which the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor digito. rum communis, and extensor carpi radialis, proceed; so that these muscles are intimately connected. 1. Supinator Radii Longusâ€”Arises, tendi- nous and fleshy, from the external ridge of the os- humeri which leads to the outer condyle. It begin* to arise nearly as far up as the middle of the bone, and ceases to adhere about two.inches above the con- M o dyle.

( 91 ) SECT. III. DIS5t:CTION OF THE HAM AND FASCIA ON THE BACK PART Of THE TWIGH. ON removing the integuments from the back-part of the knee-joint antl leg, we observe a Fascia, which covers tlie great vessels and the muscles. It is evidently continued from the great fascia of the thigh, is strengthened by adhesions to the condyles of the femur, and to the head of the fibula, and is prolonged upon the muscles on the back of the leg. Upon dissecting back that part of the fascia which covers the ham, theGiiEAT Sciatic Nerve appears, lying between the outer and inner hamstring-muscles. This nerve, having given off branches about the ham, and to the integuments on the back of the leg, di- vides at some distance above the condyles of the femur into two large branches. 1. The Greater Nerve continues its course betwixt the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles. In the ham it is named the Popliteal Neuve, and where it descends in the leg. Posterior Tibial. 2. The lesser Nerve, which is the external branch is named the Peroneal or Fibular Nerve ; it passes outwards and obliquely downwards, runs be- tween the external head of the gastrocnemius, and the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris; and sinks among the muscles v/hich surround the head of the fibula.

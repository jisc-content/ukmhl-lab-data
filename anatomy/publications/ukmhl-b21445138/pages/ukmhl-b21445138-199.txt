( 177 ) by the right subc/avian vein, and the right internal juguhir. 2. A larger branch coming from tiie left side; it is formed by the left subclavian and left interna^ jugular, which unite to form a trunk. I'his trunk crosses before the arteries arising from the arch of tlie aorta, and then enters the superior vena cava. Into the posterior part of the angle formed by the union of the left subclavian and the left jugular, the. tlioracic duct empties itself. On each side, the internal jugular vein descends along the neck by the side of the carotid, while the subclavian vein comes from the arm. The Vena Cava Inferior, immediately after' passing through the diaphragm from the abdomeai enters the pericardium. The Aorta leaves the heart opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra -, it crosses over the pulmonary artery,, ascends obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the- right side, as high as the second dorsal vertebra. Plere it forms an Akch or incurvation, which passes from the right to the left side, and at the same time obliquely from before backwards ; it then comes in i contact with the upper part of the third dorsal ver- tebra, and descends along the spine in the posterior mediastinum. This arch of tiie aorta is situated behind the first bone of the sternum, behind and somewhat below the left branch of the vena cava superior. From the upper part of the arch come off three kirge arteries. 1. The Arteria Innominata, or common. H 5 trunjlfc.

I 2 ( 105 ) be continued through the apex of the hc.irt, or .a flap may be made I)y another cut, passing from the beginning of the first alwng tlie margin of the right auricle.â€”In this ventricle, observe the projecting bundles of muscular fibres, the Tricuspid Valves arising from the margin of the ostium venosum, and projecting into the right ventricle. This valve fox*ms a complete circle at its base, but has its edge di' vided into three parts, which are attached by tendi- nous filaments, named Chords Tendine^, to the Carne.e CoLUMKiE, or muscular bundles of the rentricle. The Septum VENTRicuLonu.Nf, or partition of the two ventricles, is marked out externall}' by t^vo veins running from the apex to the basis of the heart. ' " ' Slit up the pulmonary artery; observe how it arises from the back-part of the right ventricle, hoyt smooth the inside of the ventricle becomes as it ap- proaches the entrance of the artery, or ostium arte- riosum. Observe the three Semiluvar or Siffmoid Valves. Their bases arise from the.artery, their loose edges project into its cavity, and in the middle of the loose edge of each valve is seen a small white bod}', termed Corpus Sesamoideum Arantii. The artery is seen bifurcating into the right and left pul- monary arteries, and, just before its bifurcation, sending off to the aorta the ductus arteriosus, which in the adult is a li<;ament. The Left Auricle has four pulmonary veins opening into its cavity, which may be exposed by slitting up two of those veins. Observe that its coats

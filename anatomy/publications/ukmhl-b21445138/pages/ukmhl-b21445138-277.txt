( 255 ) these several origins the fibres run In different direc tions, and converge. Those arising from the clavicle run outwards and downwards: those from the spine of the scapula outwards, forwards, and downwards; and those from the acromion directly downwards. Inserted, tendinous, into a triangular rough sur- face on the outer side of the os humeri, near its middle. Situation: This muscle is entirely superficial, ex- cept where the thin fibres of the platysma myoides arise from its anterior surface. It arises from the same extent of bone as the trapezius is inserted into, and is therefore opposite to that muscle which passes upwards from its origin, while the deltoid runs downwards. It forms a strong coarse muscle, con- sisting of large fasciculi of fibres. It conceals the in- sertion of the pectoralis major, and the origins of the biceps flexor cubiti and coraco-brachialis, and covers the whole of the fore-part, and outside of the shoulder-joint. Its insertion is situated betwixt the biceps flexor cubiti and the short head of the triceps extensor, and immediately above the origin of the brachialis internus. Its external surface is quite fleshy; but, on cutting it across, its internal surface is found tendinous: and where it slides over the great tuberosity of the. humerus, there is a large bursa, or sacculus mucosus. From the insertion of the deltoid to the outer con- dyle of the OS humeri, is extended an Intermuscular Ligament, which separates the muscles on theante^ xior part of the arm from those the posterior part, aad_

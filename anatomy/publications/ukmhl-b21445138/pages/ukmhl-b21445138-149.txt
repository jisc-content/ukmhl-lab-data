( 127 ) into two witli facility ; ami it h said that these \\va lamiiiiv, by separating ami re-unitijig, form the trian- gular cavities, named Sinuses, which are in fact large veins, 'f his division of layers can hm-dly be admitted as correct in the recent state of the membrane. The SuPEKiou LoNGiTUDiNAi, Sinus lies in a groove I'ormed by the two parietal bones; it extemis iilonsr the satjittal suture from the crista calli of the ethmoid bone to the middle of the os occipitis, vviiere it bifurcates into the two lateral sinuses; in its pas- sage backwards, its size is increased. When slit open, its triangular form is evident; it is lined by a smooth membr<me, and in it may be remarked liie numerous openings of the veins of the pia mater, ths frena, or shps of fibres cros-sing from side to side, glandulas Pacchioni internee, et externse, little bodies like millet-seed seen on the oute/ and inner surface of the sinus. The arteries of the dura raater are divided into th& anterior, middle, and posterior. 1. Artekia Mes-'ingea Media, (called also the Spinalis or Spheno-spinalis), the great middle av- teiy, is a branch of the internal maxillary ; it passes through the spinous hole of the sphenoid bone, and is seen arising from the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, (in a groove of which it lies,) and spreading its numerous branches over the dura mater. The anterior and posterior arteries are small. 2. A. Meningea Anterior is sent off from the external carotid, and enters the cranium by the fora- .jnen lacerura orbitale superius. f4 3.AÂ»

( H ) the artery, crosses the external iliac vein, passes obliquely upwards and inwards, under Poupart's li- gament, to which it is but loosely connected, and runs behind the upper extremity of the abdominal ring and spermatic cord, to reach the rectus abdo- minis. At first it is situated between the posterior surface of that muscle and the peritoneum, but higher up between the muscular fibres and the sheath. It terminates in ramifications, which supply the rectus, and which inosculate with the ramifications of the mammaria interna, sent down from the thorax on each side of the sternum. The dissection of the other abdominal muscles may now be continued. Dissect off the serrated origin of the external ob- lique from the ribs, and from the spine of the os ilium, and detach it from the obliquus internus, which lies below it, and which is connected to it by loose celluf lar substance, and by small vessels. Continue to separate the two muscles, till you find their tendons firmly attached, i. e. a little way beyond the linea se^ milunaris. Separate the tendon from the crural arch to within half an inch of the abdominal ring. 2.

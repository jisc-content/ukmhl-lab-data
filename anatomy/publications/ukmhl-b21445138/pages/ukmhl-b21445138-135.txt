( 113 ) tlie lov/er heads of tlie tibula and fibula, to the fore- part of tlie ankle, where it is-lost. b, A. Peronea Posteuior is properly the tor- niination of the artery ; it descends along the sinuo- sity of the OS calcis, inosculating with the branches of the tibialis postica, and terminates in the posterior part of the sole of the foot. 2. iNIuscular branches arise from the artery as it descends; twigs also ai-e sent over the heel and ankle. 2. VEINS. Ven.^: Tibiales PosticjE.—The posterior tibial veins are generally two in number; they accompany the artery, and terminate in the popliteal vein; they are formed of branches, which correspond to those of the artery. S. NERVES. The Posterior Tibial Nerve, which is the continuation of the great sciatic nerve, sinks below the soleus, and accompanies the posterior tibial ar- tery ; it gives off numerous filaments to the muscles in its neighbourhood. At first it continues, as in the ham, immediately behind the artery, but it gra- dually gets on tiie outside of it as it descends : so that where they pass along the sinuosity of the os calcis, the nerve is situated close in contact with the side of the artery, but neai-er to the projection of the heel than that vessel is. With the artery, it divides into, 1. The internal plantar nerve, and, 2. The external plantar nerve.—These nerves supply the muscles and integuments in tiie sole of the foot. SECT,

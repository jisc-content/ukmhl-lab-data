( H2 }' 5. The Fifth Paik, Trigemini, are muck larger than the fourtli, and are situated more out- wards and backwards. Each of these nerves arises by a number of filaments, from the anterior and lowest part of the crus cerebelli, where tlie crus unites with the pons Varolii;—it passes forwards, enters the cavernous sinus, where it untwists itself, and forms a flat irregular ganglion, the Ganglion Gasserianum, and then divides into three great branches. (1.) Ramus Occularis.—The ophthalmic nerve of Willis passes through the foramen lacerum orbl- tale superius to the apendages of the eye. (2.) Ramus Maxillaris Superior passes through the foramen rotundum to the upper ja^y itnd face. (3.) Ramus Maxillaris Ikferior passes through the foramen ovale to the lower jaw and tongue. 6. The Sixth Pair, Motores Oculorum Ex- terni, or abductores.—This nerve is small, bub riot so small as the fourth pair ; it is seen arising betwixt the pons Varolii and corpora p3'ramidalia: it enters the cavernous sinus,—it there runs by the side of the carotid artery, and passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale superius to the rectus ex- ternus oculi. While in the cavernous sinus, it gives off the small twig, which, uniting with filaments from the second branch of the fifth pair, forms the beginning ©f the intercostal nerve, and passes out of the cra- nium through the foramen caroticuni with the caro- fcid artery. 1.

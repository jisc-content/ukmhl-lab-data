VUSSELS AND NERVES ON THE POSTE- niOR PART OF THE THIGH. ARTERIES, 1. Arteria Glutea, or Iliaca Posterior.— This is the largest branch of the internal ihac artery; it passes out of the pelvis at the upper part of tiie sciatic notch. On raising the gluteus maximus, and niedius, this artery is seen coming over the py- riformis; betwixt the superior edge of that muscle and the inferior edge of the os ileum, (where that bone forms the upper part of the sciatic notch), and immediately behind the posterior fibres of the gluteus minimus. The principal trunk passes under the gluteus medius, and ramifies on the dorsum of the os ileum; other large branches are also continued to the gluteus maximus, and the muscles situated on the back part of the pelvis. 2. Arteria Sciatica, vel Iscihatica, is another luige branch of the intL-rnul iliac, which comes out from

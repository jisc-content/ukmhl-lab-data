The Obtuuatok ARXEnv, arteria obturatrix, â– which is a branch of the internal iliac artery, passes through the notch at the upper part of the foramen thyroideum, and ramifies on the deep-seated muscles at the upper and inner part of the thigh. 2. VEINS. The Femoral Vein adheres closely to the femo- ral artery in its passage out of the abdomen, and ac- companies it in its course down the thigh, where it passes under Poupart's ligament; it lies on the inside of the artery, but, as it descends, it turns more and more posteriorly, so thac where they perforate the tendon of the adductor magnus, the vein is situated fairly behind the artery. Its branches correspond to those of the femoral artery; but about an inch below Poupart's ligament, it receives the vena saphena major, to which there is no corresponding artery. . The Obturator Vein accompanies the obtura- tor artery, and has the same distribution. 3. NERVES. Nervus Crukalis Anterior, or tlie Anterior Crural nerve, where it passes from under Poupart's ligament, lies about half an inch on the outside of the femoral artery; it immediatel}'- divides into a number of branches, which supply the muscles and integuments

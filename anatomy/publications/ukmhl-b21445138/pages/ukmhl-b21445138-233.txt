( 2n ) VEINS. The veins of the face are numerous, and pass into the extcniiU and internal jugular veins. NERVES. 1. The PouTio Dura of the seventh pair, Ner- vus Communicans Faciei, or Facial nerve, after its course through the temporal bone in the aqueduct of Fallopius, comes out by the foramen stylo-mastoi- deum. It immediately gives off branches to the neighbouring parts, as behind the ear. It thea passes througli the substance of the parotid gland, and emerges on the face in three great branches, which^have frequent mutual communications: this division of the nerve is called Pes Anserinus. (1.) The ascending branch ramifies on the temple and forehead. (2.) The middle branch sends its ramifications over the side of the face, the proper Facial Nerves. (3Â«) The descending branch sends its twigs along the chin, down upon the neck, and backwards upon the occiput. 2 The Superior Cervical Nerves send off several branches, which ramify on the side of the face and head, and communicate freely with the branches of the portio dura. As, in the course of this dissection, we meet with many twigs of the second and third branches' of the fifth pair of nerves, it will be advisable here to de- scribe these nerves, 3. Nervus

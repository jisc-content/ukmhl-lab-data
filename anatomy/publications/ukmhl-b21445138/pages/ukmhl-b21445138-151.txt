( 129 ) the foramen magnum, dividing the cerebellum into two parts. 4. The splienoldal folds, two small folds of the dura mater, one on each side of the sella turcica, stretching from the posterior to the anterior clinoid processes. The dura mater aiso, in many parts of the brain, separates itslaminajto form sinuses; the principle of these will be noticed in the course of the dissection. This membrane should now be divided in the line of the division of the cranium ; its internal surface is smooth, glistening, and free from adhesion, except ia the course of the longitudinal sinus; into which veins pass from the pia mater. Detach the falx from the crista galli, and turn it backwards, observe in its lower edge tlie Inte- rior Longitudinal Sinus, which enters a sinus in the tentorium, termed Torcular Herophili, or straight sinus. This will fully expose the convolu- tions of the brain, which are closely invested by the pia mater. The Pia Mater consists of two membranes. 1. The Tunica Arachngides is a fine mem- brane, covering uniformly the surface of the pia mater, without passing into the interstices of it* duplicatures. It is attached to it, is extremely thin, transparent, without vessels, demonstrated with diffi- culty on the upper surface of llie brain by tlie blow- pipe, (which raises it into cells,) but on the base of the brain it can be distinctly seen. 2. The proper Pia mater, or tunica vasculosa, is a very vascular membrane, transparent in the iiiter- ^ '"j StiCM

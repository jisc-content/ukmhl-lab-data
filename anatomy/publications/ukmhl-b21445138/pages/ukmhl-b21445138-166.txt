( 144 ) 9. The Ninth Pair, Linouales, Lingualei; Medii, Hypoglossi.—This nerve arises from the fur- row betwixt the corpora olivaria and pyraniidalia, by several filaments, which often pierce the dura mater separately. It passes through the anterior condy- loid hole of the occipital bone, to supply the muscles of the tongue. Immediately after leaving the cranium, the eighth and ninth pair, and the ganglion of the intercostal, are connected together. 10. The Tenth Pair *, Suboccipitales, arise, on each side, by two bundles, from the extremity of the medulla oblongata, and upper part of the spinal marrow, pass through the dura mater by the same foramen which gives entrance to the vertebral ar-ter}', and run through the foramen magnum occipitale to the muscles at the base of the cranium. The corpora albicantia Willisii, are again seen, two ■white bodies, on the base of the brain, behind the infundibulum, and above the pons Varolii. The Medulla Oblokgata remains to be de- monstrated. It should be removed from the bone, and examined in an inverted position. On its under surface are seen the two vertebral arteries, ascending from the foramen magnum, and uniting, to form one trunk, the basilar artery. Ou removing the pia mater, the whole surface appears medullary; but an incision shows it to be intermixed with the cineritious substance. The Crura or Pedukculi Cerebri, are tw» • These nre hgw perhaps at frcq«ehtlj described as the ttit pair of eervical nerves. considerable

( 8* ) 5. The Gemini consist of two heads, which are distinct muscles. (1.) The superior arises from the back.part of the spinous process of the iscliium. (2.) The inferior from the upper part of the tube- rosity of the OS ischium, and the anterior surface of the posterior sacro-sciatic ligament. Imeried, tendinous and fleshy, into the cavity at the root of the tr.)chanter major, immediately below the insertion of the pyriformis, and above the inser- tion of the obturator externus. Situation : Like the other muscles, they are cover- ed by the gluteus maximus ; they lie below the pyri- formis, and above the quadratus femoris ; they are united by a tendinous and fleshy expansion, which forms a purse or sheath for the tendon of the obtu- rator internus. Use: To roll the thigh outwards, and to bind down the tendon of the obturator internus.

The Obturator Internus.—It arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from more than one half of the internal circumference of the foramen thyroideum, and from the inner surface of the ligament which fills up that hole ; its inside is covered by a portion of the levator ani; it forms a flattened tendon, which passes out of the pelvis in a sinuosity betwixt thet Epinous process and tuberosity of the ischium : and Uecomirg rounder, is Juserted

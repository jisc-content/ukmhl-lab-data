( SS ) in a railiated direction towards a strong tendon, wliicli is Inserted into the anterior and superior part of the grc-at trochanter. Situation : It is entirely concealed by the gluteus medius, and between their tendons there is a butsa mucosa. Use: Same as that of the preceding. Synonpna : Gluteus minor;—Ilio-ischii-trochante- rien. 4. The ryRiFORMis—Arises, within the pelvis, by three tendinous and fleshy origins, from the second, third, and fourth false vertebras or divisions of the sacrum. It forms a thick belly, which passes out of the pelvis below the niche in the posterior part of the ileum, (from whicli it receives a few fleshy fibres), and above the superior sacro-sciatic ligament. Inserted, by a roundish tendon, into the upper- most part of the cavity at the root of the trochanter major. Situation : Like the other small muscles of the hip, it is entirely concealed by the gluteus maximus ; its belly lies behind and below the gluteus medius, but is not at all covered by it, and above the superior gemellus. I ts tendon is covered, at the place of inser- tion, by the posterior fibres of the gluteus mediue. Sometimes the pyriformis is divided into two distinct muscles, by a branch of the great sciatic nerve. Use: To move the thigh a little upwards, and roll >t outwards.

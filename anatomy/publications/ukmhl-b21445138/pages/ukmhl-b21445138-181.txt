Inserted into the root of the tongue, runs along its side, and is insensibly lost near its tip. Situation: This muscle lies within and rather above the stylo-hyoideus; underneath it is a ligament, extending from the styloid process to the angle of the OS hyoides.—Ligamentous fibres are also seen passing from that process to the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. Use: To move the tongue laterally and back- wards. 11. The Stylo-Piiaryngeus—Arises, fleshy from the root and inner part of the styloid process. Inserted into the side of the pharynx and back- part of the thyroid cartilage. Situation : It is situated deeper, and behind the jtylo-glossus. Use: To dilate and raise the pharynx and thyroid cartilage upwards. Synonyma: Stylo-thyro-pharyngien. On removing the submaxillary glands, and detach- ing the digiistric muscle from the os hyoides and chin, we expose the next muscle. 12. The Mylo^Hyoiorus—Arises, fleshy frota all the inside of the lower jaw,, between the last dcn& niolaris and the middle of the chin; the fibres fornx a flat muscle, converge, and are Inserted into the lower edge of the base of the os- byoides. Situation; Tills muscle unites with its fellow in tt middle

The Shhincter Ani consists of two semicir- cular planes, which run round the extremity of the rectum, passing nearly as far out as the tuber ischii; the fibres of each side decussate v/here they meet, and are Inserted into the extremity of the os coccygis be- hind * ; and before, into a tendinous point comrdon to this muscle, and to the acceleratores urinas and transversi perinei. This tendinous pomt, is worthy of remark; it seems to consist in part of an elastic ligamentous substance. Use-i To close the anus, or extremity of the rec- tum, and to pull down the bulb of the urethra. It is in a state of constant contraction, independently of the will, in order to prevent the contents of the rec- tum from escaping except at those times when we make an effort to evacuate them. Synonyma: Sphincter externus ;—Sphincter cuta- neus;—Coccygi-cutane-sphincter. More deeply seated than the muscles now de- scribed, we see some of the fibres of The Levator Ani.—This muscle arises from the inside of the os pubis, at the upper edge of the fora- men thyroideum, from the inside ot the os ischium, from the tendinous membrane covering the obtu- ♦ The spliincter ani often arises bj an elastic tendon ap- proaching to llie nature of a ligament, from the apex of the OS coccygis.

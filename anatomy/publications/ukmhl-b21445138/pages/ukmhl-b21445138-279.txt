( 257 ) pezius passing Into the spine of the scapula ; and its tendon passes under the deltoid. Use: To raise the arm. Synonyma: Super-scapularis:—Sus-spini-scapulo- trochiterien. 3. The Infra.Spinatos—Arises, principally fleshy, from the lower part of the spine of the sca- pula as far back as the triangular flat surface; from the base of the bone below the spine to near the in- ferior angle ; from the posterior ridge of the inferior costa; and from all the dorsum of the bone below the spine. The fibres ascend and descend towards a middle tendon, which runs forwards over the neck of the bone, and adheres to the capsular ligament. Inserted, by a strong short tendon, into the middle part of the great tuberosity of tlie os humeri. Situation : This muscle is in part concealed. The anterior part of its belly, and its tendinous insertion, are covered by the deltoid, and the trapezius passes over its upper and back-part, but a considerable por- tion of the belly of this muscle is seen betwixt these two muscles, and above the superior fibres of the latissimus dorsi. It is inserted below the tendon of the supra-spinatus. Use : To roll the humerus outwards, to assist in raising the arm, and in moving it outwards whea raised. Synonyma : Sus-spini-scapulo-trochiterien. 4. The Teres Minor—Arises, fleshy, from the narrow depression between the two ridges in the in- ferior costa of the scapula, extending from the neck of the bone to within an inch or two of the inferior angle.

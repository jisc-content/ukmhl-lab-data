( 296 ) to the outer edge of the middle finger, and to the inner side of the fore fingt-r. (5.) The ramus Pollicis uhiaris is the last branch of the ulnar artery, and is sent to the muscles of the thumb. From the concavity of the arch are sent off the interosseous arteries of the palm, small twigs which iupply the deep-seated parts, and perforate betwixt the metacarpal bones to the back of the hand. The brunches of the ulnar artery, in its course along the fore-arm and wrist, are the following. (1.) The Recurrent Arteries are two in number. They are sent off from the ulnar artery im- mediately below the elbow, sometimes in one common branch, which subdivides. The anterior recurrent runs over the fore part of the inner condyle; the pos- terior recurrent passes over the back-part. These arteries inosculate v/ith branches of the brachial. (2.) Tw]gs to the muscles of the fore-arm. (3.) A. Dorsalis Carpi is sent off from the ulnar artery a little above the wrist to the back of the Iiand. Twigs are also given off to the annular liga- ment and neighbouring parts. (4-.'Â» A. Palmaris Profunda is sent off from the Ulnar artery, where it descends on the inside of the OS pisiforme. It passes into the flesh at the root of the little finger, and inosculates with the termination of the deep-seated palmar arch of the radial artery. 3. Arteria Interossea, (or Intcrrossea Com- munis). This artery is generally sent off from the ulnar. It immediately divides into two branches : (1.) The external or posterior interosseous artery is the smallest branch. It passes through the upper , ' part

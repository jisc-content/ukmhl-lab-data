( 13 ) be fixed by a tendinous attachment to the angle ot the pubis. Situation : It is covered by the obliquus descen- dens externus and latissimus dorsi. Use: To assist the obliquus externus: but it bends the trunk in the reverse direction, so that the muscle on each side co-operates with the obli- quus externus of the opposite side, SynoJiyma: Obliquus internus abdominis;—ob- liquus ascendens ;—obliquus minor;—ilio-lumbo- costi-abdominal. About the middle of Poupart's ligament, a deli- cate fasciculus of fibres is sent off from this muscle •ver the spermatic cord, where it passes under its edge in its way to the ring. This is named the CfiEMASTER, and is continued down to the cord^ till it is insensibly lost on the tunica vaginalis testis ; it will beseen'jn the dissection of the scrotum: Its use is to suspend, draw up, and compress the testicle. We must now dissect the attachments of the in- ternal oblique from the cartilages of the ribs, from the fascia lumborum, and from the spine of the os ilium, and, by continuing our dissection from behind forwards, separate it from the tranversalis abdominis, which lies under it. This separation may be conti- nued as far as where the tendons of the two muscles are inseparable, i. e. rather more forward than the Hnea semilunaris. As this muscle lies very close upon the transversalis, caution is required to avoid detach- ing both muscles together. Let the student begin his separation at the crista of the ilium, where the course of the circumflexa ilii artery and vein will • " shew

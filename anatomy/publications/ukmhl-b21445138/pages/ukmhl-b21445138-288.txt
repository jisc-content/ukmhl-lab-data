The dissection of the fascia of the fore-arm is simi- lar to that of the fascia of the leg. It is found firmly attached to the fibres of the muscles, so that the ex- posed surface appears ragged. It sends down betwixt them partitions, named Intermuscular Ligaments or Tendons, which connect the muscles, and give origin to many of their fibres. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FCRE-FAIIT OF THE CUBIT, AND ARISING FUOM THE INNER CON- DYLE OF THE OS HUMLUL These are eight in number, and may be divided into two classes; the superficial, and the deep-seated. First, The superficial. All the muscles passing from the inner condyle, may be said to arise by one common tendinous head fi'om the condyle; and this head may be said to divide into the diiTcrent muscles; but they will be here de- scribed as arising distinct from the condyle. It must, howevei*, be recollected, that their origins are inti- mately connected by intermuscular ligaments, and that they cannot be separated without dividing some of their fibres. 1.

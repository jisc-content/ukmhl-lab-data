( m ) bone as low as two inclics above its infcriorextrcraity, and from tlie outer part of the interosseous ligameiil. It has also generany a tendinous origin from the in- ternul condyle of tlie os humeri. This origin forma a distinct flashy slip, wiiicli is joined to the inner.and upper part of tlic portion of the muscle arising from th- r^idiiis. 'i !)e fibres pass obliquely into a tendon on the anterior surface of the muscle. The teiidoiv passes uniler the annular ligament of the wrist, runa between the two heads of the short Hexor of tha thumb, and between the two sesamoid bones, and ia Ins::rlc:l into'the base of the extreme phalanx of the thu;iib. Hltuitli'jn : This muscle lies by the side of ths flexor pi'ofundus; the portion which arises from thQ inner comlyle passes over the belly of the flexor profundus, and under the flexor sublimis. The whole muscle is concealed by the flexor sublimis; its tendon will be seen in dissecting the short mus- cles of the thumb. Uxe : To bend the hist joint of the thumb. Si/nonj/77m : Flexor tertii internodii;—lladio-pha- langettien du pouce. On separating the lower part of the two last de- scribed muscles, we expose a small square mus^cle, jpassing transversely just above the wrist. 8. The Phonator Quadratus—Arises, broad, tendinous, and fleshy, from the inner edge of the ulna, extending from the lower extremity of the bone two inches up its edge. The fibres run trans- versely, adhere to the interosseous ligament, and are Inserted.

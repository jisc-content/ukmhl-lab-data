Synonyma: Obliquus major; —Optico-trochlei- scleroticien, 7. The Obliquus Inferior—^mes, narrow, and principally tendinous, from the < uter edge of the orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone, near its junction with tiie os unguis. It runs obliquely outwards and backwards^ under the depressor oculi, and is. hiserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the sclero- tica, between the entrance of the optic nerve, and the insertion of the abductor oculi. Use : To draw the globe of tJie ey^ ferwards, in- wards and downwards,, and to turn the pupil up- wards. Synonyma : Obliquus major;—Maxillo-scleroti- cien. In the orbit, we also meet with the Lachrymal Gland.—This gland is of a yellowish colour; it is situated in a depression of the os frontis near the temple. It adheres closely to the fat which sur- rounds the muscles and posterior convexity of the eye. It sends ofi'sev small ducts which pierce the tunica conjunctiva lining the upper eye-lid; these, ducts cannot be seen, unless the part be macerated in water, when they are filled with the liquid. The PvNCTA L«ACHRYMALiA are two small holes tiear the internal angle of the palpebrai, situated one. ip each eye-lid. They lead into the Lachrymal Sac.

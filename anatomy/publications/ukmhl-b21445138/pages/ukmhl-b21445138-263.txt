( 241 ) vertebra, by five tendinous and fleshy slips, and is Inserted, tendinous, into the transverse processes of the five or six interior cervical vertel)rse.» Situation : The origin of this muscle lies on the inside of the longissimus dorsi, and is sometimes considered as an appendage to it. The insertion is situated between the cervicahs descendens and tra- chelo-mastoideus. Use : To turn the neck obliquely backwards, and a little to one side. Synonyma : Transvcrsalis cervicis;—Transversalis colli major. 14. The Trachelo-Mastoideus lies nearer to the bone than the last-described muscle. Arises from the transverse processes of the three uppermost vertebrae of the back, and of the rive in- ferior of the neck, by as many thin tendons, which unite and form a fleshy belly. Inset-ted, tendinous, into the posterior surface of the mastoid process. Situation : This muscle lies on the outside of the complexus, and on the inside of the transversalis colli; its insertion is concealed by the splenius capitis; it is covered also by the levator scapulae. Use: To keep the head and neck erect, and to draw the head backwards, and to one side. Synonyma: Trachelo-mastoideus, seu Capitis par tertium Fallopii;—Complexus minor, seu Mastoides lateralis. 15.

( 27 ) Into which the foramen of Winslow leads : it crttends from the fissure of the spleen across the spine, under the posterior surface of the stomach, and terminates within the circle formed by the duodenum; it is only covered on its anterior surface by tlie peritoneum. The Pancreatic Duct pierces the coat of the duodenum, and enters the cavity of that intestine, by an orifice common to it, and to the ductus communis choledochus. The duct runs along the very centre of the gland, where the whiteness of its coats will readily enable the student to distinguish it. All the abdominal viscera may now be removed, except the rectum, where it descends into the pelvis, which, being tied, shouW be allowed to remain, for it belongs to the demonstration of those parts: Or the liver and its vessels, with the pancreas, may be left, and the vessels entering the portas of the liver traced. The peritoneum should now be carefully dissected from the diaphragm, and from the sides and back part of the abdomen; thus the parts which lie more imme- diately behind that membrane may be examined. 8. Renes, the KinNEVs.—Two glandular bodies, situated in the posterior part of the cavity of the ab- domen, on each side of the lumbar vertebra;, between the last false rib and the spine of the ileum, and im- bedded in a quantity of adipose membrane. In each kidney you may observe a lesser arch or concavity turned obliquely forwards and. inwards ; a grcaterarch or convexity turned obliquely backward;? and outwards ;—two lateral surfaces;—two extremi- fces, the superior of which is nearer to that of the op- B 2 posite

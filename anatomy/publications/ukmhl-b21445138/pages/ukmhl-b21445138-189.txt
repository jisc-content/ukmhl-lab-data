( 167 ) becomes smaller, and descends; and opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, it forms another swel- ling', the Infekiou Cervical Ganglion. Sometimes it has another ganglion about the fourth â€¢r fiftl) vertebra of the neck, the Middle Cervical Ganglion : but this is not a constant appearance. The nerve then passes behind the subclavian artery into the thorax. The branches of llie intercostal nerve are nume- rous, and they generally pass off from the ganglions. Immediately below the base of the cranium, twigs go to the eighth and ninth pairs, and to the upper cervical nerves. In the middle of the neck, some twigs pass over the carotid ; others go to the parts covering the trachea, and uniting with filaments of the par vagum, form the external laryngeal nerves ; others unite with the descendens noni, or descend- ing branch of the ninth pair, and some filaments as- sist the twigs of the par vagum to form the superior cardiac nerve. In the lower part of the neck, twigs are sent to communicate with the cervical nerves, &c. 3. The Ninth Pair, Nervus Hj^po-glossus, or Lingual nerve, having left the skull by the anterior condyloid foramen, is connected with the eighth pair and intercostal nerve. Like them, it lies deep, and comes out from under the angle of the jaw. It is seen passing from behind the internal jugular vein, and then over the carotid artery, running betwixt these tvvo vessels. It next passes under the mylo- hyoideus, running over the stylo-glossus, hyo-glos- sus, and genio-hyo-glossus, which last muscle its jiumerous branches perforate. Branches.

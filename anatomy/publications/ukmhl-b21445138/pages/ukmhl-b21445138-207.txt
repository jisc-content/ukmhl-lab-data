f IS5 ) muscle, and then passes under the acromion, to ra- mify on the muscles below the spine of the sciipuiit. It is generally a branch of the A. Thyroidea Inferior, and is then named A. Transversahs Humeri. S. A. SCAPULARIS ExTEUNA, InFUASCAPULA- lus, or Thoracica Posterior, arises from the under and back part of the axillary artery, attaches itself to the inferior costa of the scapula, where it splits into two great branches: 1. A large branch, which passes to the outer surface of the scapula below tlie spine, and has its principal ramifications close upon the bone. 2. The other branch (which is larger) passes to the inner surface of the scapula, supplies the subscapularis, and sends branches downwards to the muscles of the back and loins. 4. AkTERIA ClRCUMFLEXA HuMEni POSTE- RIOR, Humeralis, or Reflexa-articularis, arises from the lower and fore part of the axillary artery, and runs backwards close to the bone, surrounds its neckj'and is lost on the inner surf ace of the deltoid ; it gives also twigs to the joint and neighbouring muscles. 5. A. CiRcuMFLEXA ANTERIOR is a much smaller artery, often a branch of the circumtlexa posterior ; it encircles the neck of the bone on, its fore part, and is lost on the inner surface of the deltoides, where it inosculates with the posterior circumflex artery. The Great Brachial Nerves accompany the subclavian artery over the first rib. In the axilla they are united by numerous cross branches, forming, the Axillary or Brachial Pkxis, which is continued; from

( 209 ) oiFlIie external nasal artoric's to the outside of the nose, and the A. Buceales to tlie check. Tne Kxternal Carotid is found ascending behind the parotid gland. It perforates the gland at its up- per part, ascends over the zygomatic process iininc- diatelv before t!ie ear, and divides into the anterior, midiile, and posterior temporal arteries, which ranuiy over the side of the head, giving also branches to the forehead and occiput. But ihe carotid, while it lies imbedded under the parotiJ, sends several twigs to tlio substance of that gland, and a considerable artery which passes for- wards, and ramifying on the side of the face, is named A. Tkansversalis Faciei. At this point also, the carotid sends otf a large artery, the A. Maxlllaris Interna. As many branches of this artery are met with in the dissection of the face, it is proper to give a view of its distribution. The internal Maxillary passes behind the condy- loid process of the lower jaw ; it directs its course towards the bottom of the orbit of the eye ; and it is at tliis point th it it sends off its numerous branches. (1.) Arteria Media Dur.^ Matris (or Menin- gea sp'aeno-spinalis or spinosa), passes through the spinal hole of the sphenoid bone into the cranium, and is distributed to the dura mater. (2.) A Max- illaris Inferior, vel Dentalis Inferior, runs down- wards, enters the foramen at the root of the ascend- ing processes of the lovrcr jaw, then passes through the canal of the lower jaw; supplying the teeth and sockets, and emerges by the foramen mentale, to be distributed to the chia. It is accompanied by a nerve

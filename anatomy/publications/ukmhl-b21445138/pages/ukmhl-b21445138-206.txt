( 184 ) die first rib, and before the anterior scalenus muscle into the thorax. Deeper seated, and immediately behind the axil- lary vein, lies the Axillary Artery. . It is seen coming from under the clavicle; from under the arch formed by the pectoralis minor, it comes over the middle of the first rib, and between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles. In the axilla it is surrounded by the meshes of the nerves, and runs along the inferior edge of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; when it has passed the anterior edge of the pectoralis major,.it assumes tlie name of die Brachial Artery. The branches of the axillary artery are, 1.. A. Mammaria Externa, called also, A. Thoracicae Externae.â€”The external mammary artery consists of three or four branches which run down- wards and ftinvards obliquely over the chest. These branches sometimes come off separately from the axillary arterj^, at other times by one or two com- mon trunks, which subdivide. They supply the pectoral muscles and mamma. Some of their branches pass to the muscles of the shoulder, to the side of the chest, and to the muscles on the inside of the scapula. 2. A. ScAPULAKis Inteitna, Supra-scapularis 6r Dorsalis Scapula?, is sent off from the back-part of the axillary artiery. It runs across the bottom of the neck towards the root of the coracoid process, and passes through the semilunar notch in the superior eosta of the scapula; it supplies tjie tupra-spinatus muscle,

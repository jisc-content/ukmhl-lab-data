It is composed of fibrous substance, partly ligamentous, and perhaps in part muscular; its inner surface is rugose, vascular, and occupied by mucous glands. On slitting it up, M^e see, at its posterior extremity, the Os Uteri, a rounded projection, with a transverse fissure. The Uterus, or Womb.â€”This organ is best seen from the cavity of the abdomen. It is situated be- twixt the bladder and rectum, to both of which it is connected by reflections of peritoneum ; it is of the shape of a pear, somewhat flattened, inwardly hol- low, outwardly out of a whitish colour, and of a firm consistence. The broad upper part of the womb is called the Fundus Uteri, the narrower part is named the neck, or Cervix Uteri, and the intermediate part its Body. The uterus has four ligaments, two on each side : 1. Tlie LiGAMENTUM Teres, or Hound Liga- ment. It is a round long cord, extending from the $ide of the fundus uteri, and passing through the ab- dominal ring, to be lost in the groin. The LiGAMENTUM Latum, or Broad Ligament, is a broad fold of peritoneum, reflected from the body of the uterus, and connecting it on tlie sides of the pelvis. The uterus, together with its two broad ligaments, divides the pelvis into an anterior and posterior half; in the former of which is the bladder, and in the latter the rectum. The dupli- cature of the broad ligament encloses the Fallopian lube, ovary, and round ligament. The Falloi'ian Tubes are two. Each tube is contamed

The submaxillary gland sends off a duct, which passes behind the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoi- deus, and runs along the inner surface of this mus- cle forwards and upwards, on the inside of the sub- lingual gland, to open into the mouth on the side of the frenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Gland lies immediately above the mylo-hyoideu9, betwixt it and the internal mem- brane of the mouth, Tfrhere it lines the side and in- ferior surface of the tongue. It sends off several 'ducts, which open into the mouth between the root of the tongue and side of the lower jaw.

( 192 ) Behind the trachea and vessels going to the lungs, and on the fore-part of the oesophagus, we meet witk a congeries of lymphatic glands. COURSE OF THE PAR VAGUM,OR EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES, IN THE THORAX. From the neck, the par vagum passes betwixt the subclavian vein and artery into the thorax; it imme- diately sends off a large branch, the Recurrent Nerve, back into the neck. On the right side, this branch twists round under the arteria inno- minata; on the left side, under the arch of thft aorta, it ascends behind the carotid, and lodges it- self betwixt the trachea and oesophagus, to both of which it gives branches. The par vagum, having given off the recurrent, descends by the side of the trachea, and behind the root of the lungs. It here sends off numerous fila- ments to the lungs, which, uniting with twigs from the great sympathetic, form the Akterior and Posterior Pu:pmonary Plexuses; these plexuses lie on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the root of the lungs. Other twigs of the par vagum pass, to form the inferior Cardiac Plexus about the pericardium. The trunk of the eighth pair soon reaches the oeso- phagus; the left par vagum runs on the fore-part of the oesophagus, the right nerve on its back-part. Here they split into several branches, which unite again, and form a Plexus. This plexus is called the CEso- IHAGEAL. The two nervcs eoQtiauÂ« their course alon^

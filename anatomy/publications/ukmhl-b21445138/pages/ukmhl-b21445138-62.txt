( 4.0 ) f do not join the cava, but are united behind the pancreas, to form The Superior Mesen- the Vena Portal. This TERic Vein, the Inferior vein ramifies anew Mesenteric Vein, and the i through the Hver, and Splenic Vein, its blood is returned into the vena cava by the venae cavae hepa- ticee. Although the trunks just enumerated are the chief veins that contribute to form the vena portas, yet the returning veins of all the viscera enclosed in the peritoneum, except the liver, are included in the same system, and join one or other of the large trunks. This is the ease with the stomach, pan- creas, gall-bladder, and omentum. The blood which goes to the spleen, large and small intes- tines, is all returned by the three great trunks. 3. NERVES. 1. The eighth pair, or Par Vagum, descending on each side of the oesophngus through the diaphragm, forms the two Stomachic Plexu!?es on the ante- rior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. These plexuses send some branches to the cceliac, to the hepatic, and to the splenic plexus. 2. The Splanchnic Nerve, or Anterior Inter- costal, a branch sent off by the intercostal nerve in the thorax, enters the abdomen betwijit the crura of the diaphragm ; here each nerve forms a Semi- LBNAR Ganglion by the side of the cceliac artery.

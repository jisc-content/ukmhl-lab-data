( 234 ) major may be seen between these muscles, and the inferior part of the base of the scapula. Use: To draw the scapula obliquely upwards, and directly backwards. Synonyma : Cervici-dorso-scapulaire. The rhomboidei should be reflected from the spine. 4, The Levator Scapula—Jiises from the transverse processes of the five superior vertebrae of the neck, by five distinct tendinous and fleshy slips,, which unite and form a considerable muscle. Inserted, tendinous anil fleshy, into the base of the scapula, above the root of the spine, and under the superior angle, (not into the angle itselt^ as it is usu- ally described.) Situclion : This muscle is concealed by the trape- zius and sterno-mastoideus; but a small part , of its belly may be seen in the space between the edges of these muscles. The origin of the levator scapulae is partly concealed by the splenius capitis ; and the di- gitations, where they arise from the transverse pro- cesses, lie betwixt similar attachments of the scalenL- rouscles before, and of the splenius colli behind. Use: To draw the scapula upwards, and a little forwards. Syyionyma : Elevator, seu Musculus Paticntiae;— Angularis, vel Levator proprius ;—Trachclo-angiili. scapulaire. Detaching the rhomboideus from its origin in the spine, you will see another muscle passing from the whole of the basis of the scapula. 5t The SfinuATUs Magnus—Arises, by nine fleshy

( 58 ) soft parts wTilcli extend from the inferior commisr sure of the labia to the anus. The Perineum Posterius 5s the space betwixt the anus and point of the os coccygis. The Nymphs are two prominent doublings of the integuments, extending from the glans of the clitoris to the sides of the vagina. Their external &ide is continued from the inner surface of the labia, and from the prepuce of the clitoris, while their internal surface seems immediately continued from the fine, thin, vascular, integuments covering the clitoris it- self; they are spongy, and consist internally of cel- lular and adipose substance. A little lower, we see the orifice of the urethra; it is situated below the clitoris and arch of the pubis, betwixt the nymphae, and above the orifice of the vagina; it consists of a small rising prominence like a pea, in the centre of which is a small opening or hole. On each side of the orifice of the urethra, we meet generally with the orifices of two mucdus glands, which by some are named Cowper's Glands of the female. On separating tire lower part of the labia ptidendi, we see the Vestibulum, a space which leads to the vagina; it is bounded behind, by the carunculae myr- tiformes> or by the hymen in virgins; on the sides, hy the labia; before, by the perineum antcrius, which projects forwards, forming a kind of valve, so> that a little pit is formed behind it, wliich is termed Fossa Naviculatis, or Scaphoides.

( 77 ) BRANCHES OF THK FEMOllAL AllTER^*. The A. P/;oi'UMDA comes ofFfrom the femoral ar- tery at the distance of three or four inches from Pou- part's ligament ; it is nearly as large as the femoral itself, runs down for some little way behind it, and terminates in three or four branches, which, per- forating the triceps adductor, are named Arteki.'K pERi'OUANTES. Thcso, ramifying in every direction, supply all the great mass of muscles situated on the back-part of the thigh, and inosculate largely with the sciatic, gluteal, and obturator arteries. The pro- funda also sends ofF two considerable branches, which, encircling the upper part of the thigh, are named Circumflexa Interna, and Circum_ jLEXA Externa. • ' The profunda is the only branch of the femoral artery which is constant in its size and situation ; for though, during the Avhole of its course, the femoral gives olf branches to the muscles, yet these muscular arteries vary much, sometimes coming olf from the great artery, sometimes from the profunda, some- times coming off as a large single trunk which sub- divides, while at other times there are three or four distinct arteries. The branches of the femoral artery may be enu- merated as follows:—!, tiome t\vi<TS to the ineuinal glands, and some to the external parts of generation, * The Epigastrica and Circumflexa ilii .ire before described as branches ol ihe inguinal artery.

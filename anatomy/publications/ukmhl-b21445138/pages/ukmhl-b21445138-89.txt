( 67 ) §2. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE-PART AND INSIDE OF THE THIGH, TiiFSE are nine in number. 1, The Tensok Vaginje Femoris—Arises, by a narrow, tendinous, and fleshy origin, from the exter- nal part of the anterior superior spinous process of the OS ileum : it forms a considerable fleshy belly. Inse^-ted into the inner side of the great fascia, where it covers the outside of the thigh, and a little below the trochanter major. Situation : Its origin lies between the origin of the sartorius, and the anterior fibres of the gluteus me- dius, betwixt which muscle it descends ; it does not lie external to the fascia of the thigh, but is inclosed in a duplicature of it; its insertion lies anterior to that part of this membrane which arises from the tendon of the gluteus maximus. Use : To stretch the great fascia of the thigh, to assist in the abduction of the thigh, and in its rota- tion inwards. Synonyma : Musculus fascias latae;—Fascialis;— Membranous;—Ilio-aponeuri-femoral. 2. The Sartorius—Jrwes, by short tendinous fibres, from the anterior superior spinous process of the OS ileum, soon becomes fleshy, extends obliquel j across the thigh, and passes behind the inner condyle. Inserted, by a broad and thin tendon, into the inner side of the tibia, immediately below its ante- rior tubercle. Situation: Its origin lies between that of the tensor vaginaj

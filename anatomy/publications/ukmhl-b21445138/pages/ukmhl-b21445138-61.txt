( 39 ) 2. VEINS. The Vena Cava Abdominalis, vel Inferior, is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins, it passes up through the abdomen on the lum- bar vertebrae, and on tlie right side of the aorta. In this course it receives the following veins, which resemble their corresponding arteries : 1. The Lumbar Veins. 2. The Emulgent or Renal Veins;—the left is the longest, as it crosses over the fore-part of the aorta. 3. The Right Spermatic Vein;—the left enters , the left renal vein. The vena cava then passes through the fissure of the liver, being nearly, surrounded by that viscus, and receiving three branches from it, called the Ven^e Hepatic^. It then perforates the dia- phragm, and enters the thorax. The common iliac vein of each side is formed by the union of two branches, the External and In- ternal Iliac Veins, which accompany the arte- ries of the same name: —The common iliac vein of each side lies on the inside of its artery; hence both veins cross behind the right iliac artery, to unite and form the vena cava, on- the fore-part of the lumbar vetebrae *. • It may be here proper to observe, that generally a great- >ein accompanies every great artery ; but when the ramifica- tions become tmall, each artery ia attended by two veins.

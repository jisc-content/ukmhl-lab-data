•sternum to the dorsal verteLra;, they form tlie me- diastinum.—The pleura lines the ribs, and the upper surface of the diaphragm, and is reflected over the lung, which is in fact behind it; it forms tlie liga- ■mentum hitum pulmonis, a reflection of this mem- brane, which connects the inferior edge of the lungs to the ?pine and diaphragm. 2. The Lungs.—Co/our, reddish in Children, greyish in adults, and bluish in old age.—S/iape^ corresponding to that of the thorax, somewhat py- ramidal, convex towards the ribs, concave towards the diaphragm, and irregularly flatted uex-t the me- diastinum. Division (1.) The Right Lung is the largest, and is divided into three lobes, two greater ones, and aa intermediate lesser lobe. (2.) The Left Lung has two lobes, and also a square notch opposite the apex of the heart. Into the sulci or grooves which form the divisions of the lungs into lobes, the pleura enters; that part of the lung which is affixed to the spine, is called its root; it is the part by which the great vessels enter. . 3. The Pericardium is a strong, white, and compact membrane, smooth, and lubricated upon the inside, forming a bag for containing the heart, and having its inner lamina reflected over the sub- stance of the heart itself. 4. Wlien you slit open the fore-part of the peri- cardium, you expose the Heart. The right ven- tricle protrudes; the right auricle also is towards you ; while the left auricle is retired, and its tip is «een lapping round uj)on the left ventricle. From .uudejf

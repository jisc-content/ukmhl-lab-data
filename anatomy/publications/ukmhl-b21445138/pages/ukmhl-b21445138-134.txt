The branches of the Posterior Tibial Artery ia the leg are, 1. The Peroneal Artery, which comes off from the tibial a little after it has sent off the anterior ti- l)ial, of which this arterjf is sometimes a branch ; it is generally of a considerable size, sometimes nearly as large as the tibial itself; it runs upon the inside of the fibula, giving numerous branches to the peroneal muscles and flexor of the great toe; but its course is irregular and inconstant. At the lower part of the leg, it splits into, a, A. Peronea Anterior, which passes betwixt the

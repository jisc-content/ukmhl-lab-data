( 106 ) the belly of that muscle ; and, at the lower part of the leg, the belly, is seen projecting through the ten- don of the gastrocnemius, and forming the lower calf. Its fleshy belly is tendinous on its posterior surface, where the tendon of the gastrocnemius slides over it; and there is a bursa mucosa betwixt the upper part of the os calcis, and the tendo Achillis. Use: To elevate the os calcis, and thereby, to lift- up, the whole body, as a preparatory measure to its being carried forward in progression ;—to carry the leg backwards on the foot when that is fixed ;—the gastrocnemius, from its origin in the thigh, also bends the leg on the thigh. Synonyma: Gastrocnemius : — Bi-femoro-calea- nien, SoLEus: Tibio-peronei-calcanien. Both muscles are sometimes called Extensor Tarsi Suralis, vel Extensor Magnus. The heads of the gastrocnemius should now be lifted up,w hich will expose 3. The Plantaris.—This muscle arises, fleshy, •from the upper part of the external condyle, and from the oblique ridge above that condyle, forms a pyramidal belly about three inches in length, which adherses to the capsule of the knee-joint, runs over the popliteus, and terminates in a long, slender, thin tea- don. This tendon passes obliquely inwards over the inner head of the soleus, and under the gastrocnemius; €merges from between those two muscles, where their tendons unite, and then runs down by the inside of the tendo Achillis, to be Inserted nAo i he posterior part of the os calcis, on 9 the

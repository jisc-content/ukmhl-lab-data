( H.5 ) I consulerable inctlullary fasciculi, proceeding from the centre of the medulla of the brain, more imme- diately from the corpora striata; they unite at an acute angle, and are united to the pons Varolii *. The Crura or Pedunculi Cerebblli are very large, and pass from the medullary part of the cere- bellum which forms the arbor vitae to the pons Va- rolii. The Pons Varolii, Tuber Annulare, or Nodus Cerebri, is a medullary protuberance, formed by the union of the crura cerebri and cerebelli, over which it is stretched hke a bridge; on its surface is a raphe, or transverse fibres passing into a middle longitudinal narrow depression. Below the pons Varolii, and separated from it bjr a sulcus, are seen four eminences : 1. The two external are named Corpora Oli- VARIA, 2. The two internal are named Corpora Pyra- MiDALiA, and, by separating these two bodies, me- dullary cords, passing transversely, appear, the nervi intercerebrales. The point of union betwixt the corpora pyrami- dalia and pons Varolii, is sometimes called foramen caecum. The medulla oblongata now contracts itself, and^ passing through the foramen magnum o.ccipitaJe,. assumes the name of * On making a section of (he crura cerebri, near to their union with the pons Varolii, a portion of a dark-brown colour, surrouiidi d witli white medullar^ subÂ«lance, is ieen, termed Ldcus A'iger Crurum Cerebri,

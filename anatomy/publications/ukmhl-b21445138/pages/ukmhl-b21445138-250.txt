( 228 ) twigs also pass to the eye lids, and to the inner an- gle of the eye. The arteria Frontalis is a branch of this artery ; it is seen running towards the supra- orbitary notch or foramen, and is distributed to the forehead. The Ikfra-Orbitary Artery is found in the lower part of the orbit; it is the continued trunk of the internal maxillary, entering the orbit by the spheno-maxillary slit. It is seen passing along the canal in the upper pare of the great tuberosity of the OS maxillare superius, and emerges on the fac* by the infra-orbitary hole. VEINS. Thesecorrespond with the arteries; they discharge their blood partly into the branches of the external jugular vein near the forehead and temples, and partly into the internal jugular, NERVES. 1. The Optic nerve is seen coming through the foramen cpticura, and entering the back-part of the globe of the eye, to form the retina. 2. The Nerve of the Third Pair, Motok Oculi, having entered the orbit through the superior orbi- tary fissure, or loramen lacerum, is divided into four branches. (1.) The first runs upwards, and subdivides into two nerves, of which one supplies the levator oculi, and the other the levator palpebrae superioris. (2.) The second branch goes to the depressor oculis, and is short. (3.) The

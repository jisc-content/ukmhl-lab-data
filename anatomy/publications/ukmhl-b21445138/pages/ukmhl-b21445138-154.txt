The Lateral Ventricles are two, right and left, lined with a fine membrane, narrow, consisting of a body, and three prolongations or cornua. 1. The body is formed betwixt the corpus callosum, the medulla of the brain, the convexity of the corpus striatum, and the thalamus nervi optici. 2. The anterior cornu or horn is formed betwixt the more acute convexity of the corpus striatum, and the anterior part of the corpus callosum. 3., The posterior cornu (called also the digital cavity) may be traced stretching backwards and downwards into the posterior lobe of the brain. 4. The inferior or descending cornu cannot be traced in this stage of the dissection ; it seems Uke the continued cavity of the ventricle, takes a curve backwards.and outwards, and then, turriing forwards, descends into the middle lobe of the brain. The lateral ventricles communicate with each others and with the third ventricle, by an opening under the fore-part of the arch of the fornix*.. la ♦ It has been doubted whether or not this be an opening the choroid plexus passes through it, and seems to unite iha surfaces; it is abiurcily named the Foramen Monroianum, froia a mistaken notion that Dr. Munro discovered it, and may be seen hy gently turning the anterior crus of the fornix to one side j it is a space betwixt the most anterior part of the con- Texity of the thalami neriorum oplicorum, and the anterior crus •f the fornix.

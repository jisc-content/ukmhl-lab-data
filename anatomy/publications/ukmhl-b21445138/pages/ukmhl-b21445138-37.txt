( 15 ) of the crural arch, where it is covered by a thin fascia arising from Poupart's ligament, and continued up- wards between the peritoneum and transversalis mus- cle, until it is gradually lost. This is named by Mr. Astley Cooper, its discoverer, thefascia transversalis, and prevents the bowels from being protruded under the inferior margins of the obliquus internusand trans - versalis muscles. It is perforated about the middle between the ilium and pubes, by an opening for the -passage of the spermatic chord, which then goes ob- liquely downwards inwards and forwards to the ring of the external oblique. Thus the abdominal ring is a canal, having an upper or internal opening, formed in the fascia transversalis, and a lower or external one in the tendon of the obliquus externus *. The -sheath of the rectus is now to be attended to; it is formed by the tendons of the three other mus- cles, viz. the two obliqui, and the transversalis: These, when they reach the edge of the rectus, form the appearance named Linea Semilunaris ; they then split and inclose the rectus in their duplicature ; the whole tendon of the external oblique, with the ante- rior layer of the internal oblique, passes before the rectus; and the whole posterior layer of the internal oblique, together with the whole tendon of the trans- versalis muscles passes behind the rectus, excepting at the lower part; but, for two or three inches above the pubis, all the tendons go in front of the muscle, * For more complete descriptions of these very important parts, see Mr. Cooper's Works on Hernia, or iMr. Lawrence's Treatise on the same subject. and

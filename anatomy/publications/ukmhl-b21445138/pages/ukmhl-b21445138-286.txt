Below the deltoid, it is superficial, and arises more outwardly than the brachialis intern us, supinator radii longus, and extensors of the carpus. The brachialis externus is situated immediately un- der the integuments; it begins to arise below the in- sertion of the teres major. It passes down the arm between the triceps longus, and coraco-brachialis at first, afterwards between the triceps longus and bra- chialis internus. The tendon of the triceps sends ofiF a thin fascia, which covers the triangular surface of the ulna, on which we commonly lean. Numerous fibres are also sent off, to assist in forming the fascia of the fore-arm. Use: To extend the fore-arm. Tlie long head will also assist in drawing the arm backwards.

( 105 ) Reflect the two heads af the gastrocnemius from the femoral condyles, and you will then expose 2..The SoLEUs, or Gastrocnemius Inteknus— which mises, by two origins or heads. The first, or External Origin, which is by much the largest, in ises, principally fleshy, from the posterior surface of the head of the fibula, and from the external angle of that bone, for two thirds of its length, immediately behind the peroneus longus. The second, or internal head, arises, fleshy, from an obUque ridge on the pos- terior surface of the tibia, just below the popliteus, and from the inner angle of that bone, during the middle third ol' its length. The two heads which are ■Beparatgd at first by the posterior tibial artery and nerve, unite immediately, form a large belly, which, CQvered by the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is con- tinued, fleshy, to within a short distance of the ankle- joint; a little above which the tendons of the gas- trocnemius and soleus unite, and form a strong round tendon, named the Tendon Aciullis, which slides over the upper and posterior part of the os calcis, /where it is furnished with a small bursa mucosa, »1;o be Inserted into a rough surface on the back-part of that bone. Situation ; The gastrocnemius arises between the hamstring-tendons: Its belly is superficial, and forme the upper or greater calf of the leg : on lifting it up, the tendon is seen continued some way on its inner surface. The soleus lias its largest part concealed by the igastrocneraiuSj but part of it appears oh each side of £ 5 th^

Observe the parts of the bladder not covered by peritoneum ; as they are the situations of surgical operations. These are the whole anterior surface^ lying against the pubis, and rising above it, when the bladder is distended, so that it may be punctured above the pubis ;—the &ides, as the very lowest 1 jaj-1^ of which the cut is made in the lateral operation of;' lithotomy, and where the viscus may be puncmKe^^ from the perineum ;—and the inferior surface, rest* j-j. . i CRARY ing on the rectum, and allowing us to puncture fromi' it. Observe also the direction of the axis of the bladder, in conformitj' with which all instruments should be introduced: this is in a line drawn from the navel to the 03 coccygis. 10. The entrance of the ureters into the bladder on the outside of the vesiculae seminales. 11. The rectum, following the curve of the os sacrum, and os coccygis. 12. The prepuce is a fold of skin forming a sheath or covering for the glans penis. It makes a duplica- ture extending along the flat part of the glans from its basis to the orifice of the urethra, termed Fr^num Pr^putii. To have a more connected view of the relative situation of these important parts, one side of the • III the fcefus, it is a prolongation or production of llie toats of the bladder. c 2 pelvis

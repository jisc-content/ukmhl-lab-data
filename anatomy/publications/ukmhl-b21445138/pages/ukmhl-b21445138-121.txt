( 99 ) lower extremity of the fibula: is then reflected for- wards through a superficial fossa in the outside of the OS calcis, passes over a projection, runs in a groove in the os cuboides, passes over the muscles in the sole of the foot, and is Inserted, tendinous, into the outside of the base of the metatarsal bone that sustains the great toe, and into the os cuneiforme internum. Situation: The belly is quite superficial; it lies between the outer edge of the extensor longus digi- torum and the anterior edge of the soleus, connected -to both by intermuscular ligaments. The tendon is superficial where it crosses the outside of the os calcis, but, in the sole of the foot, is concealed by the mus- cles situated there, and will be seen in the dissection of that part. Use : To extend the ankle joint, turning the sole of the foot outwards. Synonyma : Peroneus maximus, vulgo, Peroneus posterior;—Peroneus primus, seu posticus;—Tibi- peroneo-tarsien. 6. The Peroneus Brevis— Arises, fleshy, from the outer edge of the anterior angle of the fibula, and from part of the smooth surface behind that angle ; beginning about one third down the bone, and conti- nuing its adhesion to near the ankle ; from the fhscia of the leg, and from the intermuscular ligaments :— The fibres run obliquely towards a tendon, which passes through the groove of the fibula behind the outer ankle, being there inclosed in the same liga- ment with the tendon of the peroneus longus, then E 2 through /

139 ) will be found situated between the Uvo lobes on thif" under suriace ol'the cerebellum, and iinmedialely be- hind the medulla oblongata. On separating the two lobes behind, and makings a deep incision, we discover, The Fourth Vkntkicle.—The sides of this ventricle are formed by the cerebellum, the anterior part by the medulla oblongata, the upper and back part: by the valvula cerebri; it is lined by a thin vascular membrane, and has on its fore-part a groove or fis- sure, which, terminating in a sharp point, is named Calamus Scriptorius. On each side of this groove are seen several medullary lines, which are the origin pf the portio mollis of the sevenjih pair of nei'ves. The iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum enters the upper part of the fourth ventricle. The valvula cerebri hangs over it. On cutting the cerebellum perpendicularly, there is formed, from the intermixture of cineritious and medullary matter, a tree-like appearance, named Arbor Vit.e, of which the trunk is termed the peduncle of the cerebellum, and is continued to the back-part of the medulla oblongata. This concludes the demonstration of the cerebellum. To demonstrate the medulla oblongata and nerves, either the brain must be removed from the cranium, or it may be gradually inverted in the progress of the demonstration ;—and this is the better method. The inversion must be begun at the fore-part by raising the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. Thus you will see, 1. The First Pair of Merves, The Olfactory, called also Processus Mamillares. They arise from the

( 29!) ) {3.) The Ulnar Neuve desceiuls along tlio inside of the arm. It is at first situated immediatuly under the integuments, but below the middle of the arm Is tied down by the intermuscular ligament which passes to the inner condyle of the humerus. The nerve be- comes here more deeply seated ; it runs between the inner condyle in the hollow behind it and the olecra- non, and in the flesh of the brachialis externus, or third head of the triceps extensor. After passing the condyle, it continues its course betwixtthe two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, till it reaches the ulnar artery. It then accompanies the ulnar artery, lying on its inside, and running along the fore-arm betwixt the flexor ulnaris and flexor digitorum sublimis. It sends twigs to the neighbouring muscles, and, when arrived near the wrist, divides into two branches. 1. The Smaller Branch, called liamus posticus, passes under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and over the lower end of the ulna, to be distributed to the back of the hand, and of tlie little and rin.? fingers. 2. The continued trunk of the nerve passes, on the inside of the ulnar artery, over the annular li- gament of tlie wrist. It passes under the palmar apo- neurosis, and divides into three principal branches. The first supplies the integuments and muscles on the ulnar edge of the hand, and the inner side of the little finger. The second is distributed to the outer side of the little finger, and inner side of the ring-finger. The third branch passes deep under the long tendons, accompanies the deep-seated palmar arch, and ter- minates in the short muscles of the thumb and fore- finger, communicating M'ith the radial nerve.

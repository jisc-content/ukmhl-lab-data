^ r 165 ) foramen lacerum in the base of the cranium. It comes out deep from under the angle of the jaw, and in its course do^vn the neck, it runs on tlie outw side of the carotid artery, before it reaches the thorax ; it passes rather more forwards than the artery, to join the subclavian vein. Its branches accompany the ramifications of the external carotid. At first the vein which accompa- nies each artery is a single branch, but it soon sub- divides, so that two veins accompany one artery. NERVES.. I. The Eighth Pair, or Par Vagum.â€”On se- parating the internal jugular vein, and trunk of the carotid artery, the par vagum is seen lying in the same sheath of cellular substance with those vessels. It lies in the triangular space formed betwixt the back-part of the artery and vein, and the subjacent muscles. This nerve comes out of the foramen lace- rum with the jugular vcm ; hence it adheres to that vein more closely than to the artery or muscles; it- runs down the neck behind these vessels. In this course it gives off several nerves. (1.) At the base of the cranium, it sends off seve- ral filaments, which are connected with the other nerves coming out of the base of the skull, such as the ninth pair, the superior cervical ganglion of the intercostal, &c. (2.) Nervus Glosso-Pharyngeus is sent off from the eighth pair, deep under the angle of the jaw. It passes behind the carotids towards the mus- cles

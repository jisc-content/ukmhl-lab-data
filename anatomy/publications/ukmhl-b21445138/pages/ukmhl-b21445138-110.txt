( 88 ) becoming flat, passes behind the head of the tibia, and is reflected forwards, to be Inserted into the anterior angle of that bone, some little way below its tubercle. Situation : This muscle, as well as the biceps, is covered above by the gluteus maximus; its belly lies between the biceps flexor and gracilis, and is situated entirely superficial; its tendon is inserted below that of the gracilis ; The belly of this muscle is intersect- ed, about its middle, by a narrow transverse tendi- nous line. Use : To bend the leg backwards, and a little in- wards, Synonyma : Seminervosus ;—Ischio-creti-tibial. 11. The Semimembranosus—Arises, by a strong round tendon, from the upper and outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium ; the tendon, soon becom- ing broader, sends off obliquely a fleshy belly ; this muscle is continued, fleshy, much lower down than that last described.—The fleshy fibres terminate ob- liquely in another flat tendon, which passes behind the inner condyle, sends oflf a thin aponeurotic ex- pansion under the inner head of the gastrocnemius, to cover the posterior part of the capsule of the knee-joint, and to be affixed to the external condyle: the tendon then becoming rounder, is Inserted into the inner and back part of the head ©f the tibia. Sititation : This is a semi-penniform muscle; its origin l:»s anterior to the tendinous origin of the two last muscles, and at the same time more outwardly, being

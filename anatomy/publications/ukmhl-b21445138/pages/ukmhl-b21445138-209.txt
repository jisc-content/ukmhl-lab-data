Course of the Phrenic Nerve through the thorax—On each side this nerve is seen entering the thorax betwixt the subclavian artery and subclavian vein; it then proceeds downwards and forwards before the root of the lungs, and on the outside of the pericardium, betwixt that bag and the pleura: it id lost on the diaphragm. The left phrenic nerve lias a somewhat longer course than the nerve of tJie right side, as it passes over tlie pericardium, where that bag covers the apex of the heart. This nerve is accompanied by one artery and two veins; some twigs pass from the phrenic nerve into the abdomen, to the liver, &c. Behind the arch of the aorta and great vessels passing from the heart, is seen the Trachea. It •enters the tliorax between the two pleurae, and, op- posite the third or fourth dorsal vertebra, bifurcates into two parts: one of which passes toward the right, the other toward the left,, to enter the lung of each side. By folding back the lungs towards the left side of .•the chest, we expose the pleura reflected from the * By Posterior Mediastinum is designed that part of the me. diaslinuni situated behind the root of the lungs. lunder

( no ) ircim and clavicle to the upper part of the os humeri**- They are not covered by any fascia, but by a con- densed cellular membrane, which is similar to a thin aponeurosis, and is vtith difficulty dissected away, unless it be done very regularly. Three pair of muscles are described in this dissec- ^on. L The Pectorat.is Major—Arises, tendinous, from the anterior surface of the sternum, its whole length ; fleshy, from the cartilages of the filth, sixth^ and sometimes the seventh ribs, and from two an- terior thirds of the clavicle. The fleshy fibres run obliquely across the breast, and, converging, form a Strong flat tendon, which is Inserted into the ridge of the .os brachii on the «utside of the groove for the long tendon of the Biceps flexor cubitii Situation ; Th« belly of tliis muscle is superficial^ It is separated from the deltoid muscle by cellular membrane and fat, by the cephalic vein, and a small artery, named A. Thoracica Humeraria. Its tendi- nous fibres, arising from the sternum, are interlaced with those of the opposite, so as to form a kind of fascia covering the bone; and the origins from the ribs are intermixed with the obliquus externus abdo- minis. The clavicular and thoracic portions of the muscle are separated by a line of cellular membrane. The tendon is covered by the anterior edge of tlie deltoid; it forms the anterior fold of the arm-pit, and- appears twisted, for the fibres which proceed from tli* * Called also Os Bracliii. thcfrackr

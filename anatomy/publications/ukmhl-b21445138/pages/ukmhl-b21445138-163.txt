i Ul ) etance, leading from the inferior and anterior ex- tremity of tiic third ventricle to the pituitary gland ; it is generally imperforate before it reaches the gland. The Pituitary Gland, a reddish body some- what globular, consisting of two lobes, is situatedia the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone, partly co- vered by a fold of dura mater, and attached to the in- fundibulum. The circular sinus is situated at this point. On detaching the cerebrum from theback-part of the sella Turcica, the tunica arachnoides is very evident. 3. The Third Pair of Nerves, Motores OcuLORUM, arise from the crura cerebri *, pass out- wards and forwards on the outer side of the posterior clinoid process into the cavernous sinus, and run- through the foramen laccrum orbitale superius to the muscles of the eye. Between these two nerves are seen the two verte- bral arteries, ascending and unitisg, to form the ba- silary artery. 4. The Fourth Pair, Trochleares or Pa- THETici, are very slender, and situated immediately under the edge of the tentorium. 'J'his nerve arises from the valvula cerebri, comes out from betwixt the cerebrum and cerebellum, passes by the side of the pons Varolii, and, passing through the cavernous ^ sinus, continues its course through the foramen lace- rum orbitale superius, to supply the obliquus supe- rior muscle of tHe eye. * The two crura pass obliquely backwards and inwards, so as to converge and meet in front of the tuber annulare ; it is from the hollow formed by their convergejice, and named by Vicq d'Azyr, fosse des ncTfs oculo-musculaires that the third pair arise. 5 S.

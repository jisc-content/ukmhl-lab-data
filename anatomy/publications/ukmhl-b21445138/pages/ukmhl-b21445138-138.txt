Use : To bend-the second joint of the toes. Synonyma: Calcaneo phalanginien comraun. Situation : The muscles of this order are quite su- perficial, being only covered by the fascia plantaris. The first order of muscles being removed, or be- ing lifted from their origins, and left hanging by their tendon, the second order is exposed. 1. The tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum pedis is seen coming from the inside of the os calcis; and having reached the middle of the foot, dividing into its four tendons, which pass through the slits of the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis, and are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes. 2. The tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis is seen crossing under ' the tenijon of the flexor longus digi- torum, and, having given to it a shojt slip of tendon, * III the erect posture, it aosses above, lyini nenrcr to tlie metatarsal boues tliaii lliat tendon ; but in the description, the sole of the foot is supposed to be placed uppcrniobt.

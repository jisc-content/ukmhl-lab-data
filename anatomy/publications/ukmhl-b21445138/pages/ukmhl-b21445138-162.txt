( 140 ) the outside of the corpora striata, between the ante* rior and middle lobe of the brain; run under the anteriorlobes, being lodged in two superficial grooves, and lying beiween the pia and dura mater; expand into a small oval ganglion, from which several small filaments descend through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, to ramify on the membrane lining the nose. 2. The Second Pair, the Optic, arise from the posterior part of the optic thalarai, and also from the tubercula quadrigemina ; they make a circle round the crura cerebri called the Tractus Opticus. The two nerves approach gradually, and unite, just before the pituitary gland, on the fore-part of tlie sella Tur- cica. 1 hey then diverge, and each nerve passes out at the foramen opticura of the sphenoid bone, to form the retina of the eye. On each side of these nerves are seen the Carotid Arteries. Each artery emerges from the cavernous smus by the side of the anterior clinoid process: sends a branch forwards, which, uniting with a simi- lar branch of the other carotid, forms the anterior part of the Circulus Arteriosus Willisii; wliile other branches, passing backwards, and uni- ting with branches of the basilar artery, complete the posterior part of the arterial circle. A fold of dura mater passes from the anterior t© the posterior clinoid process of each side. This fold is double, and forms by its duplicaturc the Caver- NOUSSINUS. On dividing the optic nerves, and inverting them, we see the iufuadibulum, a funnel of cineritious sub- 6tance»

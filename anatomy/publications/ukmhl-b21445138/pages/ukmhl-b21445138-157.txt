( 135 ) peculiar eminence or convexity, called the Anterior Tubercle; they are elongated downwards, to I'orm the optic nerves. T^NiA Semicircularis, a white medullary line, running in the angle betwixt the corpus striatum and thalamus nervi optici of each side. COMMISSURA ANTERIOR CEREBRI, a short cvlindrical medullary cord, stretched transversely between the fore and lower part of the corpora striata, immediately under the anterior crura of the fornix. Just above the coramissura anterior, and before the thalami, is the Vulva, or foramen commune anterius, a small slit or indentation, formed by the anterior crus of the fornix, bifurcating, and inserting itself, on each side, between the corpus striatum and thalamus nervi optici. This slit is the space by' which the three ventricles communicate. CoMMissuRA Mollis is an exceedingly soft, broad, cineritious junction betwixt the convex sur- faces of the thalami nervorum opticorunl. On separating the optic thalami, we discover the Third Ventriclk.—This is a longitudinal sulcus, or slit, situated betwixt the thalami nervorum opti- corum, and betwixt the crura cerebri. Above, it is covered by the fornix and velum interpositum ; at its upper and fore part, it communicates with the two lateral ventricles; below the commissura anterior, it opens into the infundibulum. This opening is term- ed iter ad infundibulum. Backwards, it is continued by a canal which passes under the tubercula quad- rigemina into the fourth ventricle,—This passage is naxued

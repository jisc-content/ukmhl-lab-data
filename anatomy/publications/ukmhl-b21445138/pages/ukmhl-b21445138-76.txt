You must not expect to meet with uniformity in the distribution of these vessels in all subjects, some- times the gluteal and pudic arteries come off by onft trunk, sometimes the pudic and sciatic, &c. &c. 2. VEINS. The veins attend the arteries and their ramifica- tions ; they unite to form the internal iliac vein, ex- cept the veins from llie rectum, named Hosmorrhoi' dales, which ascend along its back part to join tliÂ« inferior mesenteric vein. S. NERVES. The ner/es met with in this dissection consist of numerous twigs sent off from the lumbar and sacral nerves to supply the parts about the pelvis. But, in this dissection, we meet with three pair of large nerves, which have their course through the pelvis, and pass to the thigh. 1. Course of the Anterior CnunAL Nerve while in the pelvis. The anterior crural nerve is formed by branches of the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves; at its origin, it lies under the psoas magnus, and, as it descends, passes betwixt the psoas magnus and iliacus internus, till, having passed under Poupart's ligament, it emerges from betwixt those muscles, and appears on the outer side of the inguinal artery. 2.

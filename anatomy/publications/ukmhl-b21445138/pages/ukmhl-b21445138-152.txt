( 130 ) strces of its vessels, investing the substance of the brain, descending betwixt all its convolutions, and lining its different cavities; but, where it lines the ventricles, it is fine, delicate, and less vascular, than on the surface, and betwixt the convolutions of the brain: It is connected to the dura mater by its veins passing into the longitudinal sinus. The brain is divided into three parts: 1. The cerebrum; 2. The cerebellum ; 3. The medulla ob- longata. The CEREBRtJM consists of two distinct sub- Stances : 1. The cineritious or cortical substance forming the outer part. 2. The white or medullary substance forming the inner part. The brain is divided by the falx into two hemi- spheres, and by the pia mater into numerous convo- lutions. Each hemisphere is divided into three lobes, 1. The Anterior Lobes rest on that part of the cranium which forms the two orbits, and is called the anterior fossae of the basis of the cranium. 2. The Middle Lobes are situated before and above the medulla oblongata, and rest on the middle fossa; of the basis cranii, which are formed by the sphenoid and temporal bones. 3. The Postejuok Lobes are supported by the tentorium. The anterior andmiddlelobes are parted by a deep narrow sulcus, which ascends obliquely backwards ifirom the temporal ala of the os sphenoides to near the

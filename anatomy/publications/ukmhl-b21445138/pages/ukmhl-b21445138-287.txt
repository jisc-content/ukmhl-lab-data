find, as in the leg, a strong lasci;i invesling all the muscles. This i'ascia is continued iVoni the inter- muscular ligaments which pass down to the condyles of the OS humeri. It is atlac!u?d to the condyles, and it adheres firmly to the olecranon of the ulna. It re- ceives, on the- posterior i)nrt, a great addition oClibres from tlie tendon of the triceps extensor ; and on the fore-part of the arm, it appaars to he a continuation of the aponeurosis which is sent oH'lVom the biceps tlcxor cubiii. Above the fascia, we meet witl; several cutaneous veins and nerves The veins liave been alread}' de- scribed ; the nerves are twigs of the brandies of the brachial plexus. The rebttive situation of the vessels at the bend of the arm should be well attended to. Tiic cutaneoui veins situated here vary much in size. The vena ba- silica is seen running over the fore-part of the bend of the arm near the inner condyle, the vena cephalica situated near the outer condyle; and each of these veins receives a branch passing obliquely from ths vena mediana major. 'J'hese vessels lie,above the fas- cia, while the brachial artery lies deep boncath the fascia, in a holiow resembling that of the axilla. It descends over the joint near the inner condyle, on the Ii-iside of the tendon of th^ biceps flexor cubiti, and under the aponeurosis sent ofFfrom that muscle to the common fascia of the fore-arm. It lies embedded in cellular substance, betwixt the pronator teres and flexor muscles of the wrist and fingers on one side, and the supinator longus and extensor muscles o\\ the TOther. Ill this hollow, it divides into the radial ul.

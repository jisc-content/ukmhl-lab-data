All these parts are con- nected and inclosed b}' condensed cellular mem- brane, which forms a kind of sheath for containing them. At the bottom, and in the middle of the neck, the carotid is covered by the sterno-cleido- mastoideus ; at the upper part, by adipose mem- brane, absorbent glands, and by the platysma myoides. It lies deep on the muscles of the spine, and gives off no branches, until it reaches the space between the larynx and angle of the jaw, just below the cornu of the os hyoides, where it divides into the external and internal carotids.

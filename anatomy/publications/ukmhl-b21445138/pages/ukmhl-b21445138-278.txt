( 256 ) and gives attachment to the fibres of both. It is named the External Intermuscular Ligament. Use: To draw the arm directly upwards, and to move it a little forwards and backwards, according to the different directions of its fibres. Reflect it from the scapula and clavicle, that you may expose more completely the muscles on the dorsum of the former bone. Synonyma : Sous-acroniio-clavi-humeral. The following two muscles, which fill up the posterior surface of the scapula, are covered by a fascia, which adheres to the spine and edges of that bone. On dissecting off this fascia, the fleshy fibres of the muscles will be found arising from its inner surface. 2. The Supra Spinatusâ€”Arises, fleshy, from all that part of the base of the scapula that is above its spine, from the superior costa as far forwards as the semilunar nitch, from the spine itself, and from the concavesurface betwixt it and the superior costa. The fleshy fibres, as they approach the neck of the scapula, terminate in a tendon which passes under the acromion, slides over the neck of the scapula, (to which it is connected by loose cellular membrane,) adheres to the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, and is Inserted into the anterior and superior part of the <Treat tuberosity near the head of the os humeri. Situation; This muscle fills up the fossa or cavity above the spine of the scapula, and is entirely con- cealed. Its belly is covered by the fibres of the tra- pezius

( 70 ) fleshy, from tlie anterior surface of the roe»t of the trochanter major, from the outer edge of the linea aspera, its whole length, —from the oblique line run- ning to tlie external oond3'le,—and from the whole external flat surface of the thigh bone. The fleshy fibres run obliquely forwards. Inserted into the external surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris, and into the side of the patella:— Part of it ends likewise in an aponeurosis which passes over the side of the knee to the leg, and is firmly fixed to the head of the tibia, closely ad- liering to the capsule of the knee-joint. Situation: This muscle forms the large mass of flesh on the outside of the thigh ; it is in part con- cealed by the rectus: on its outer surface, it appears tendinous at its upper part, and fleshy lower down; on its internal surface, it is fleshy above, and tendi- nous below;—it laps over the outside of the cru- rasus, where it arises from the linea aspera; it is situated anterior to the tendinous insertion of the gluteus maximus, and to the origin of the short head of the biceps flexor cruris : Use: To extend the leg, or to bring the thigh forwards upon the leg. 5. The Vastus Internus—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the fore-part of the root of the trochan- ter minor, from all the upper edge of the linea aspera, from the oblique, line running to" the inner condyle^ and from the whole internal surface of the thigh bone. Its fibres descend obliquely downwards and forwards. Inserted into the lateral surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris, and into the side of the patella: it also sends

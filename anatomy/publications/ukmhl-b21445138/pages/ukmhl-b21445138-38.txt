( 16 ) and the posterior part of the slieath is consequently deficient, the rectus lying naked on the peritoneum. The two oblique muscles are now to be replaced; then, making an incision by the side of the linea alba, and thus opening the sheath of the rectus through its whole length, you dissect it back towards the linea semilunaris,- and thus lay bare the fibres of the muscle next to be described. 4. Rectus Abdominis.â€”A7-ises,hy a flat tendon, from the fore-part of the os pubis ; as it ascends, its fleshy belly becomes broader and thinner. Inserted, by a thin fleshy expansion, into the ensi- form cartilage, and into the cartilages of the three inferior true ribs. Sitifatmi: This pair of muscles is situated on each side of the linea alba, under the tendons of the ob- lique muscles. The muscle is generally divided by three tendinous intersections ; the first is at the um- bilicus, the second where it runs over the cartilage of the seventh rib, and the third in the middle between these; and there is commonly a half intersection below the umbilicus. J^}' tiiese intersections, the muscle is connected firmly to the interior part of its sheath, forming the line^s; XRANSVERs^ffi; while it adheres very slightly by loose cellular substance to the posterior layer. Use: To compress the fore-part of the abdomen, to bend the trunk forwards, or to raise the pelvis. Synonijma: Piibio-sternal. On each side of the linea alh;;, and inclosed in the lower part of the sheath of the rectus, is some- times found a small mutjcle, named 5. Pyra-

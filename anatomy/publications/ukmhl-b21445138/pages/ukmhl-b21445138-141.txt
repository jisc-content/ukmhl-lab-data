( 119 ) M-nal sesamoid bone, adlierin<j to the adductor nollicis. Use: To contract the foot, by bringing the toes nearer each other. Synoni/ma : Mecatarso-phuhngien du pouce. Ranging with this order of muscles, we may also observe, A broad strong ligament, passing from the ante- rior sinuosity of the os calcis over the surface of the OS cuboides. The tendon of the tibialis posticus, dividing into rnumerous tendinous slips, to be inserted into the bbones of the tarsus. Situation: The muscles of the third order lie under tithose of the second order, but are only partially con- ccealed : —The flexor brevis pollicis lies under the ten- ddon of the flexor longus pollicis ; the adductor polli- ccis lies on the outer side of the flexor brev s, and is iin part concealed bv the tendons of the flexor digito- rrum longus.—The flexor brevis minimi digiti is a small lifleshj' mass, lying on the metatarsal bone of the little ' foe, and not concealed by any muscle of the second 0order.—The transversalis pedis runs across under the ttendons of the flexor digitorum longus and lumbri- ccalcs, and is seen projecting betwixt those tendons. Having removed the muscles last described, we eexpose the fourth and last order. 1'he tendon of the peroneus longus is seen passing •along a groove in the os cuboides, and crossing the tarsal bones, to be inserted into the base of the meta- i tarsal bone of the great toe, and into the internal ituneiforme and second metatarsal bone.?.

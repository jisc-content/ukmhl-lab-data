Other twigs come from the sacral nerve?, and from the sciatic in its course down the thigh, § 2. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE BACK-PART OF THE THJCH. These are eleven. On removing the integuments and fascia from the hjp, we denude, 1. The Gluieus Maximus.—It arises, fleshj-, ^om the posterior third of the spine of the cs ileum, from the whole lateral surface of the sacrum, below the posterior spinous process of the ileum ; from the back-part of the posterior or inferior sacro-sciatic ligament *, over which the edge of this muscle hangs in a folded manner, and from the lateral surface of the OS CQCcygis. Tiie fleshy fibres proceed obliquely forwards and downwards, forming a thick broad coarse muscle, and converging gradual!}', terminate in a strong flat tendon. This tendon slides over the posterior part of * The sacro-sciatic ligaments are two in number, they pass between the ischium and sacrum. 1. The external or inferior, or posterior, sacro-sciatic liga- menf, arises from the extcrual edge of the tranvcrse processes of the sacrum, descends obliquely, and is inserted into the tuberosity of the os ischium. 2. The internal, or aiUcrinr, arises from the edge of the transverse processes of the sacrum, and of the os coccygis; it passes across on the inside of the externa!, and is inserted into the point of the spinous process of the ischium. thft

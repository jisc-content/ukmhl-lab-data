( 179 ) The order in which the followhig arteries arc sent off from the subclavian varies much ; soinc'times tliey come ofl'singly, at other times in hirge trunks, which subdivide. Backwards the subclavian sends off, 1. The Vertebral Autehy.—This artery arises frora the back-part of the subclavian, passes out- wards and enters die foramen in the transverse pro- .cess of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends through the transverse processes of the vertebrae, to enter the foramen magnum of the occipital bone. 2. The Inferior Thyroid Artery ascends obliquely inwai'ds, passes behind the internal jugular vein to ramify on the thyroid gland, where it inos- culates largely with ,the superior thyroid arteries. Branches from this artery pass to the trachea and oesophagus, to the muscles of the neck, and of the scapula: one of these is the supra scapulary artery, (see the account of the branches of the axillary artery.) 3. A. Cervicalis Anterior, vd Profunda^ passes deep to the muscles situated on the fore-part -of the cervical vertebrae, and ascends as high as the base of the skulL 4-. A. Cervicaxjs Posterior, vel Superficia1is<, is larger than .the Jast; it ascends obliquely out- Wctrds, generally passes betwixt the transverse pro- cesses of the last ciervical and first dorsal vertebra2« ,and ascends on th-g'back-part of the neck, deeply seated; some of its branches pass down the back superficially. Anteriorly, the subclavian artery gives off, uG .5. A..J\jUm-

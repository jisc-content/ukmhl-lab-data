f 148 ) of the ribs, gives twigs to the great sympathetif nerve, and twigs which pierce backwards to the' muscles of the back ; then, entering the groove ia the lower edge of each rib, it accompanies the inter- costal artery, and runs towards the anterior part of the thorax, supplying the great muscles of the chest, giving twigs to the diaphragm,: and muscles of the abdomen; 3. The Lumbar Nerves are five pairs.—They arise in the same manner ; their trunks are coverod. by the psoas magnus muscle. Each nerve gives twigs to the muscles of the loins and back, and to the sym- pathetic nerves, and runs obliquely downwards to S'lpply the abdominal muscles and integuments of the groin and scrotum; but the trunks of tliese nerves assist in forming the nerves of the thigh. 4. The Sacral Nerves are five on each side, arising from the cauda equina. They come out through the anterior foramina, and send small branches to the neighbouring parts; but the great trunks of these nerves are united witli the lumbar serves, to form the nerves of the lower extremity, viz. (1.) The Anterior Crural Nerve, passing «ut under Poupart's ligament to the extensor mus- cles of the leg, is formed by branches of the first, «econd, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. (2.) The Obturator Nk.rve, leaving the pelvis by the thyroid holes, and being distributed to the deep-seated muscles on the inside of the thigh,, arises from branches of the second, third", and fourth iumbar nerves. (3.) The IsciiiATic or Sciatic Nerve, the greatesfc

C 32 ) from the edge of that bone between its anterior su- perior spinous process and the acetabdum, and from all its hollow part between the spine and the linea innominata. Its fibres descend under the outer half of Poupart's ligament, and join the tendon of the psoas magnus, Inserted with the psoas magnus. Situation: It fills up the internal concave surface of the OS ileum, and is situated on the outside of the psoas magnus. It is covered by a pretty strong fascia, which is inserted into the crista of the ileum, and into the crural arch: Fascia Iliaca. The latter inser- tion prevents the bowels from descending under Poupart's ligament, except at the inner edge of the iliac vein, which is accordingly the situation of the crural hernia, and which the student should examine most carefully, A part of this fascia is also continued behind the femoral vessels over the pubis, to form a part of the sheath which encloses those vessels*. Use: To assist in bending the thigh, and in bring- ing it directly forwards. Synonyma: Iliacho-trochantin. 2V. B. The insertion of the two last-described mus- cles cannot be seen till the thigh is dissected, when it will be found to lie between the vastus internus and the pectina^us. 4.

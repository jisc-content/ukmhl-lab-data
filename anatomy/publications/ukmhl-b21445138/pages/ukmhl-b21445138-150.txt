i 128 ) 3. A. Meni\gea Posterior is given off by the vertebral artery ; the dura mater also receives Email twigs from the occipital, pharyngeal arteries, &c. The nerves of the dura mater are said to come from the fifth pair; if they exist at all, they are email, aud seldom demo)astrated. OF THE SEPTA OF THE BRAIN, OR PROCESSES OF THE DURA MATER. 1. The Falx (septum sagittale, verticale, medias- tinum cerebri, or falciform process) is a long anu broad fold, or duplicature of the inner lamina of the ^ura mater, dividing the cerebrum into two hemi- spheres, extending from the crista galli of the eth- moid bone, along the middle of the os frontis and point of junction of the two parietal boneSyto- the crucial ridge of the occipital bone, where it termi- nates in the middle of the next septum. 2. The Tentorhjm Cerebelli, or transverse septum. This separates the cerebrum from the cereÂ« helium, and is formed by the inner lamina of the dura mater, reflected off" from the os occipitis along the groove of the lateral sinuses, and the edge or angl^ of the temporal bones. It is frequently called- Tentorium Cerebello Super Extensum. Its position- is horizontal. There are some other folds of the dura mater not visible in this stage of the dissection. 3. The falx of the cerebellum, or small occipital septum, will be seen when the cerebrum is re- moved. It extends from the middle of the tento- rlU|ra along, the middle spine of the os occipitis to the

Ihe tendon becomes gradually rounder, and is Inserted into a rough surface on the outer side of the inferior extremity of the radius. Situation: This muscle is situated immediately under the integuments along the outer edge of the arm and fore-arm. It begins to arise from the os humeri im^mediately belov?^ the insertion of the del- toid. Its origin lies betwixt the brachialis internus and short head of the triceps extensor cubiti, from which it is separated by the external intermuscular ligament. It descends along the radius, placed at first between the extensor carpi radialis longior and pronator teres, lower down between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor radialis lon- gior. Its insertion is crossed by the extensors of the thumb. . Use: To roll the radius outwards, and turn the palm of the hand upwards; also to bend the for(*-arra on the humerus.

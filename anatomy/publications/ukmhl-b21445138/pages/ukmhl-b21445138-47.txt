( 25 ) c, The lower half is named Ileum ; it Is situated more in the lower part of the abdomen, and termi- nates in the great intestine, by entering the caput coli, or beginning of the colon. As a general observation it may be said, that the convolutions of the small intestine occupy the middle of the umbilical and hypogastric regions ; but their situation varies much, particularly according to the State of the bladder and rectum. The course of the tube, independently of its convolutions, is from the left lumbar region, where the duodenum emerges from under the mesocolon to the right inguinal re- gion, where the ileum terminates in the caput coli. (2.) Great intestine. d, The Cmcvm, or blind gut, is tied down by the peritoneum to the loins on the z'ight side, lying in the space under the right kidney, hid by the convo- lutions of the ileum. On its posterior part there is a little appendage, of the shape of an earth-worii% named Appendix Cceci Vermijhrmis, e, The Colon.â€”Its commencement at the csecuox is termed Caput Coli, or head of the colon ; it mounts upwards from the caecum over the anterior surface of the right kidney, to which it is connected by cellular substance, passes under the gall-bladder, which, after death, tinges it with bile; and thea, going across the upper part of the belly, forms its Great Transveuse Arch. In its whole course it is contracted into cells by its muscular fibres, which are united together, forming longitudinal bands; and it has eorae fatty projections attached to its surface, named Appendices Epiploicae.

( 260 ) Head, arises, by a strong tendon, trom a smootli sur- face in the upper edge of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It passes over the head of the os humeri, within the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and enters a groove betwixt the two tuberosities of that bone. It forms a strong fleshy belly. The second and innermost, called the Short Head, arises, tendinous, from the lower part of the coracoid pro- cess of the scapula, in common with the coraco- brachialis, and sends off a fleshy belly. These two fleshy bellies are at first only cor^iected by condensed cellular membrane. They form a thick mass; and, below the middle of the arm, become inseparably united. They send off a strong tendon, which is at first broad, but soon becomes rounder, and passes over the fore-part of the e]bow-joint. It then slides over the cartilaginous middle surface of the tubercle at the upper end of the radius, and is Inserted into the posterior and internal rough part of that^tubercle, A bursa mucosa is placed between the tendon and front of the tubercle. Situation : The tendon of the long head cannot be seen till the capsular ligament of the shoulder is open- ed: Where it runs in the groove of the os humeri, it lies betwixt the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, and is firmly bound down by tendinous fibres passing from the capsular ligament and adjacent tendons. The short head arises from the coracoid process, be- twixt the origin of the coraco-brachialis and the strong ligament which passes from the coracoid pro" cess to the acromion. These two origins ye conceal- ed by the deltoidesand pectoralis major. The belly of the 9 \

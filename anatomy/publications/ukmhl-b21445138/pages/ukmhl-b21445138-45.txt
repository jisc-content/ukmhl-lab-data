( 23 ) ficial depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the h'ver: it sends off the Ductus Cys- tic us, which, uniting with the Ductus Hepa- TICU3, forms the Ductus Communis Choledo- CHus ; this perforates the first curvature of the duodenum. 4. Ventriculus, the Stomach.—Situation: In the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions: Connected to part of the interior surface of the diaphragm, to the concave surface of the liver by the little epiploon, to the spleen by a reflection of peritoneum, and to the arch of the colon by the great omentum. Observe its greater curvature look- ing downwards, its lesser curvature looking up- wards ; and its two lateral surfaces. In the living body, the greater curvature is turned forward, and a little downward, the lesser arch backward, i. e. towards the spine, while one of the lateral convex sides is turned upwards, and the other downwards. Observe the bulging extremity on the left side, the cardia or upper orifice, where the oesophagus enters Jialf-way between this great extremity and the lesser arch: the pylorus, or lower orifice, at the end of the small extremity, situated under the liver, and rather to the right side of the spine, feeling hard when touched. 5. The Intestines.—These form one continuous tube, but are divided into two portions, differing in their figure, structure, and functions, and distin- guished by the names of small and large. The small intestine is divided into duodenum, je- junum, and ileum; the large into caecum, colon, and rectum. (1.) Small

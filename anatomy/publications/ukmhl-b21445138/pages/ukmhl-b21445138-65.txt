( ) The muscles of the perineum consist of five pair, and a single muscle : Erector Penis, ^ Accelerator Uhium, / ^ ^^^j^ ^ Sphincter Transversus Perinei,V ^.j^ ^ Ani, single Levator Ani, i ' / muscle. COCCYGEUS, y Jn commencing this important dissection, recollect that the erector muscle, covering the crus of the pe- nis, arises from the tuber ischii, and ascends on the inside of the ramus of that bone;â€” that the transversua perinei arises from nearly the same point, and crosses the perineum,, lying often at a considerable depth in the adipose substance. The tuber ischii then becomes a proper place for the commencement of the dissec- tion ; carefully tracing the muscles arising from that point, remove all the cellular substance, situated in the perineum, while the muscular fibres are left un- touched ; the Raphe or line running along the skin of the perineum, marks the place where the opposite muscles meet. The appearance of these muscles will vary in different subjects. In those who have died weak and emaciated, the fibres will be pale, and not very evident, while in strong muscular men, who have expired suddenly, they will be very distinct. This dissection is to be continued till all the parts be- tween the tuberosities of the ischia on each side, and between the tubis before, and the tip of the os coc- cygis behind, are fairly brought into view.

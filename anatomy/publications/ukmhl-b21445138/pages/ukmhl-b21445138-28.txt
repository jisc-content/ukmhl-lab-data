( ^ ) the pectoralis major, serratus amicus, and latissiraus dorsi should be dissected with it. The muscular fibres proceed obliqueh' downwards and forwards, and about the middle of the side of the belly terminate abruptly in a thin broad tendon, which is continued in the same direction over all the forepart of the belly. Here it covers the anterior surface of the rectus abdominis ; it is very tliin at the upper part, where the rectus lies on the cartilages of the ribs, and is often removed by the beginner, unless he is very cautious. Insertion : Tendinous and flesh}", into two ante- rior thirds of the outer edge of the crista of the os ilium, from tlie anterior superior spine of which, for it extends to the os pubis, forming Poupart's liga- ment into the ensiforra cartilage, and into the whole length of the linea alba. Situation: It is quite superficial, and covers the whole of the anterior part of the abdomen. The muscular part is closely cdvei'ed by a thin expansion of cellular substance, which might be mistaken for tendinous fibres, but it is only the cellular mem- brane condensed, and ought to be removed along with the integuments. Use : To draw down the ribs in expiration, to bend the ti'unk forwards when both muscles act, or to bend it obliquely to one side when one of them acts singly ; to raise the pelvis obliquely when the ribs are fixed ; to compress the abdominal viscera, to thrust the diaphragm upwards, to assist in the expulsion of the urine and fa:ces, and of the fcetus.

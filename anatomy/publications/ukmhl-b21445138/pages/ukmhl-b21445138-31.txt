( 9 ) student will be much confused by this multitude of names, unless he remembers that they denote only one object; that the crural arch, the inferior or mtcr column of the abdominal ring, Ponpari's or l/ie inguinal ligament, are so many names applied to the inferior border of the tendon of the external obhque muscle of the abdomen.

Immediately under the skin, and above this apo- neurosis, you perceive the congeries of lymphatic glands, and sometimes tlie lymphatic vessels them- selves can be distinguished by their semi-transparent coats, and knotted appearance. Also, immediately vmder the skin you will find the VtNA Sapiiena run- ning from below upwards, at first lying on the fascia, and then gradually sinking through it to join the fe- moral vein, about an inch below Poupart's ligament' On removing thi'^ irregular fascia, we come down upon the great vessi ls, whi-h lie deeply imbedded in cellular substance, and are closely invested and sup- ported l)y a firm sheatli, or fascia, consisting chiefly of celKilar substance, very much condensed.

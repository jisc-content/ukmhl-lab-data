,( 115 ) J 7. The Seventh Pa in, Nervi Aubitorii, consists of two portions. (].) Tiie Fortio Dura or tlio facial nerve, arises from the crus cerebclli, and conies out from the fossa or i^roove betwixt the pons Varohi, corpora olivaria, and crura cercbelli. ('2.) The Fortio Mollis, or more properly the audi- tory nerve, arises from the inner surface of the fourth ventricle ; it has a groove on its surface for receiving the portio dura; accompanied by an artery, they enter the meatus auditorius intern us, where the por- tio mollis is distributed to the parts of the internal ear, while the portio dura runs through the aqueduct of Failopius, and comes out at the stylo-mastoid foramen below the ear, to form the principal nerve of the face. 8. The Eighth Pair, Par Vagum, arises by numerous filaments from the sides of the corpora olivaria and medulla oblongata. Two distinct fasci- culi are formed, the uppermost called nervus glosso- pharyngeus, the other the proper par vagum;â€”they unite, run towards the foramen lacerura in basi cranii, pierce the dura mater, and pass out through the anterior part of the hole, having been first joined by the Nervus Accessorius ad Par Vagum, which runs up from the medulla gpinalis through the great occipital foramen. The great Lateral Sinus passes out by the back-part of the same foramen, to form the internal jugular vein ; it is separated from the nerve by a sJip ox cartilage. 9. The

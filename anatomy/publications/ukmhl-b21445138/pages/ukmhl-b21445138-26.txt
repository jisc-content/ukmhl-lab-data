( ^ ) The Bursoe Mucosae met with in the dissection of the muscles are not regularly enumerated ; but it it to be undev.stood, that wherever tendons are describ- ed as rubbing on bones, muscles, or other tendons, a sac is formed by the surrounding cellular membrane, secreting synovia, to lubricate the parts in motion. Trochanter to the great troclianter of the os femoris. Trochin to the lesser proiuherance near the head of the OS humeri. Trochmitin to the lesser trochanter of llie os femorii, Epitrcchlte lo the interna) condyle of tlie os humeri. Epicon-lyle to the external condyle of ilie os humeri. Phalange to the first phalanx of the Sngers or toes. Phalaiigine to the second phalanx. PhaLangette to the third plialanz. Sus, above—sous, below—pre, before. The syiionyma, however, are rather to be considered as a matter of curiosity, thau as names that have any chance of coming into geneial use. Being intended to convey a sort of anatuniical description of the muscles, a great [iroporiion of them are by far too long for names. 'I'lie disadvantages of that no- menclature are pointed out by Dr. Barclay of Edinburgh, in a late work on the subject, a work which discovers abilities of the first order. From the specimens which this anatomist has already given, it is to be expected, that he will soon present tjie world wiih a complete list of names, much better adapted to general use, than any that have liithcrlo been employed. New terms, however, ought first lo be given in the Latin Ian*- guage. Tlipy would thus be mure easily adopted by anatomists of all countries, and might afterwards, if necessary, be trans- lated into the vari us modern languages, in such a manner as wuuid best iuit the {i.tnius of each.

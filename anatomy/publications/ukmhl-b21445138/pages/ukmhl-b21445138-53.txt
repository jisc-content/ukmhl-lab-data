( 31 ) it sends off a small long tendon, which, running on the inside of the psoas magnus, is Inserted, thin and flat^into the brim of the pelvic, at the junction of the os iliuiti and pubis. Situation : This muscle lies on tlie anterior part of the loins, betwixt the psoas magnus and the verte- brae; sometimes, however, it is wanting. Use: To assist the psoas magnus in bending the loins forward: in some positions, it will bend the pelvis on the loins. Synonyma: Pre-lumbo pubien. 2. The Psoas Magnus.—It arises, fleshy, from the side of the body, and transverse process of the last vertebra of the back, and in the same manner from all those of the loins, by as many distinct slips^ It I'uns down over the brim of the pelvis, and is Inserted, tendmous, into the trochanter minor of the OS femoris, and fleshy, into that bone immediate- ly below the trochanter. Situation : It is situated betwixt the psoas parvuJ and iliacus internus, close to the fore-part and sides, of the lumbar vertebrae : at its origin it has some con- nection with the diaphragm, and with the quadratus^ lumborura. Use : To bend the thigh forwards, and roll itout- v/ards; or, when the inferior extremity is fixed, to assist in bending the body. Synonyma : Lumbaris internus—Pre-Iumbo-tro- chantin. 3. The Iliacus Internus.—It arises, flesh}', fromt the transverse process of the last vertebra of the loins, from all the inner margin of the spine of the os ileum^- B ^ fronft

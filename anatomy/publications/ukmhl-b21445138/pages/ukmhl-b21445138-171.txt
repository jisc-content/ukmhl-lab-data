( 11.9 ) greatest nerve of the body, passes out from fhchac'k part of the pelvis, through the sacro-sciatic in)tchj, and takes its course along the back of the thigli, to supply the thigh, leg, and foot; it is formed from the two hist nerves of the loins and three first of the sacrum. All these nerves of the spine connnunicate freely by numerous twigs, and by the intervention of The Great Svimpathetic Nerve, or Inter- costal.—This nerve, origmally derived froni the sixth pair, and from some filaments of the fifth, passes out of the cranium with tlie carotid arterj'. It then descends through the neck, and forms three .ganglions in its course, which give cvvigs to the neigh- bouring parts, and are joined by filaments from the • cervical nerves, and the eighth and ninth pairs. The intercostal then enters the thorax, and descends by the side of the vertebrae, behind the pleura, giv- ing filaments, which, joining with twigs of the eighth pair, form several plexuses to supply the heart, lungs, &c. In the abdomen it descends on. the lumbar vertebrae, and at last terminates in the pelvis on the extremity of the coccyx. While in the thorax, it gives off a branch, which uniting with branches of the dorsal nerves, forms The Anterior Intercostal, or Splanchnic Nerve.—This nerve, passing betwixt the crura of the diaphragm, enters the abdomen, forms the semi- lunar ganglion, and is distributed by numerous plex- uses to all the abdominal viscera. The eighth pair, or par vagura, has also a very Jong course ; it arises in the head, passes through .g3 the

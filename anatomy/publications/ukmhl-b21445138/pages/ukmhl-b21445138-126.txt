C( 104< ) SECT. II. DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE LEG. The fascia which invests the posterior part of the ' leg, is mucli thinner and less strong than in the fore- part ; it must be removed, to expose the parts no\r to be described. MUSCLES ON THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE LEG. Those are seven in number. 1. The Gastrocnemius Exterxus, or Gemel- lus—Arises, by two distinct heads;—The first, or Internal Head, arises, tendinous, from the upper and back.part of the internal condyle of the os fcraoris, and flesliy from the oblique ridge over that condyle. —The second, or External Head, arises in the same manner, from the external condyle. Each of the heads forms a fleshy belly, the fibres of wliich are oblique, passing from a tendinous expansion which covers the posterior surface of the muscle to another tendinous expansion vphich covers the anterior sur. face, or that surface which lies nearest the bones. The two bellies, of which the internal is by much the largest, are separated by a considerable triangular i iterval, in which the popliteal blood-vessels and nerves pass to the leg, but descending, unite a little below the knee-joint in a middle tendinous line, and below the middle of the tibia send oS' a broad flat tendon, which unites a little above the ankle with the tendon of the soleus.

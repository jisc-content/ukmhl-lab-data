( 151 ) transverse processes of tlie cervical vcrtebrnc, enters the cranium by the foramen magnum, and gives branches to the dura mater and spinal marrow.— Uniting with its fellow, it forms the basilar artery, which Lfives branches to the internal" ear, branches to form the circulus arteriosus, and then divides into two large branches called Posteriores Ceuebri, which supply the back parts of the cerebrum. The Veins pour their blood into the sinuses, •which are numerous. None of these veins requjF5^*~~~- ^ I BORC particular attention, except the ophthalmic veipggjj^j- which passes through the foramen lacerum orbitaj^^"^—~ superius. The principal sinuses, viz. the longitudi-^i>^,p nal, the two lateral, the inferior longitudinal, have been described in the dissection of the brain. The remainder of these sinuses are situated in folds of the dura mater, but are not regular in their situa- tion. They transmit their blood to the longitudinal and lateral sinuses, which termiaate in forming the internal jugular veins. o CHAP.

The Writer of the following pages, having frequently witnessed the diffi- culties which attend the pursuit of Practical Anatomy, conceived that some assistance might be derived from a Com- pendium, describing the various parts of the Human Body as they come into view under the knife of the Dissector. With this in ten lion the present performance is offered to the Public. The muscles are demonstrated in the order of their situation, this being the only method that can be pursued in actual Dissection. The relative situation of the several a 3 partsVi PREFACE, parts is minutely attended to, and, at the same time, repetitions are avoided, as far as the nature of the arrangement adopted would allow. Should this work in any degree facilitate the progress of the Ana- tomical Student, the object of the Author will be attained.CONTENTS. Page General Rules for Dissection 1 Chap- I.

GENERAL RULES FOR DISSECTIO^^. section can only be acquired by practice ; the observance, however, of certain general rules, will facilitate the labour of the student. 1. The position of the hand in dissecting should be the same, as in writing or drawing; and the knife, held, like the pen or pencil, by the thumb and the two first fingers, should be moved by means of them only ; M'hile the hand rests firmly on the two other fingers bent inwards as in writing, and on the wrist. The instrument can be guided with much more stea- diness and precision in this way, than when it is moved by means of the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, in the manner which young dissectors often fall into. 2. No more of the integuments should at any time be removed, than is necessary for the present dissec- tion, as exposure to tli^e air renders the parts dry and indistinct. manual operation of dis- Ai 2 ) 3. In dissecting muscular parts, the muscles should be extended; the cellular membrane, which connects them to the integuments, should be placed on the stretch, and entirely removed with the skin ; the knife should be kept close to the muscles, and carried steadily in the direction of their fibres, separating a fasciculus at each stroke :—thus the exposed surface will appear clean, and the course of the fibres dis- tinct. 4:. When small vessels are to be demonstrated, another method is to be follow ed; the skin only must be removed, and the cellular membrane cautiously and slowly dissected from the vessels. 5. During dissection, every little operation should be practised, which can give the dexterity of hand so essential to the surgeon ; such are, the use of the catheter and probang, the introduction of a probe through the nose into the Eustachian tube, or nasal duct, and the cutting down to the various arteries, which may become the object of surgical operations; as the external iliac, femoral, anterior and posterior tibial, brachial, radial, and ulnar, &c. The grand object of the surgical student is to ac- quire a knowledge of the relative situation of parts. This should be kept in view in all his anatomical labours. Hence, when he is dissecting the muscles, he should carefully expose the chief blood vessels and nerves ; and attentively consider their position with regard to each other, and to the surrounding parts. This species of knowledge will afford him the most essential assistance in his future operations on the living subject; in which indeed it is so necessar}', thatA 2 TrDchanter ( ) tluit we are perfectly astonished to see persons rash enough to use the knife without possessing this in- formation ; but we view the hesitation, confusion, and bkmders by which such operators betray their ignorance to tlie bystander, as the natural result, and the well-merited but too light punishment, of such criminal temerity. The smaller arteries and veins, and the minute nervous ramifications, will be more advantageously studied in subjects devoted to those purposes, and prepared by means of injection, im- mersion in spirits of wine, &c. The reader will observe, that, in general, the mus- cles of one side of the body only are described, be- cause all the muscles of the body have correspondent ones on the opposite side, with a few exceptions which are pointed out. To the description of each muscle are subjoined the synonyma of the best inyological writers, and the names * proposed by Professor Pu- mas of Montpellier, in his new Nomenclature. The * These names will be distiiiguished bj being placed last among the sjnonyiiia of eacli muscle ; their terminations, as adapted to liie French language, are retained. The following is the list of the changes made in the names of the bones, oii which the new nomenclature of Dumas is founded. Sai-Arronuen ii the name given to the edge of the cla- yicle placed above the acromion of the scapula. Sens Acromio7i to the edge of the same bone situated un- derneath. Saipnlum to the scapula TTocliiter to tiie greater protuberance near the head of the OS humeri.( ^ ) The Bursoe Mucosae met with in the dissection of the muscles are not regularly enumerated ; but it it to be undev.stood, that wherever tendons are describ- ed as rubbing on bones, muscles, or other tendons, a sac is formed by the surrounding cellular membrane, secreting synovia, to lubricate the parts in motion. Trochanter to the great troclianter of the os femoris. Trochin to the lesser proiuherance near the head of the OS humeri. Trochmitin to the lesser trochanter of llie os femorii, Epitrcchlte lo the interna) condyle of tlie os humeri. Epicon-lyle to the external condyle of ilie os humeri. Phalange to the first phalanx of the Sngers or toes. Phalaiigine to the second phalanx. PhaLangette to the third plialanz. Sus, above—sous, below—pre, before. The syiionyma, however, are rather to be considered as a matter of curiosity, thau as names that have any chance of coming into geneial use. Being intended to convey a sort of anatuniical description of the muscles, a great [iroporiion of them are by far too long for names. 'I'lie disadvantages of that no- menclature are pointed out by Dr. Barclay of Edinburgh, in a late work on the subject, a work which discovers abilities of the first order. From the specimens which this anatomist has already given, it is to be expected, that he will soon present tjie world wiih a complete list of names, much better adapted to general use, than any that have liithcrlo been employed. New terms, however, ought first lo be given in the Latin Ian*- guage. Tlipy would thus be mure easily adopted by anatomists of all countries, and might afterwards, if necessary, be trans- lated into the vari us modern languages, in such a manner as wuuid best iuit the {i.tnius of each. CHAP.( 5 ) CHAP. I. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. In dissecting a subject, it is usual to begin with the Muscles of the Abdomen. SECT. I. MUSCLliS OF THE ABDOMEN, ANT) Tdii PARTS CONNECTED WITH THEM IN DIS- SECTION. rj^HESE muscles are ten in number, five on each side. An incision should be made through the integu- ments, from the sternum to the os pubis ; and this, should be crossed by another passing immediately below the umbilicus : dissect off the flaps ; this will lay bare. ]. The Obliquus Descendens Externus.— Origin : By eight triangular fleshy slips from the I jwer edgesand external surfaces of the eight inferior ribs, at a little distance from their cartilages; the five superior sUps meet on the ribs an equal number of the digitations of the serratus major anticus, and the three inferior are connected with the attachments which the latissimus dor^i has to the ribs. Often there are only seven portions. To gain a complete view of this muscle, the neighbouring portions of A 3 the( ^ ) the pectoralis major, serratus amicus, and latissiraus dorsi should be dissected with it. The muscular fibres proceed obliqueh' downwards and forwards, and about the middle of the side of the belly terminate abruptly in a thin broad tendon, which is continued in the same direction over all the forepart of the belly. Here it covers the anterior surface of the rectus abdominis ; it is very tliin at the upper part, where the rectus lies on the cartilages of the ribs, and is often removed by the beginner, unless he is very cautious. Insertion : Tendinous and flesh}", into two ante- rior thirds of the outer edge of the crista of the os ilium, from tlie anterior superior spine of which, for it extends to the os pubis, forming Poupart's liga- ment into the ensiforra cartilage, and into the whole length of the linea alba. Situation: It is quite superficial, and covers the whole of the anterior part of the abdomen. The muscular part is closely cdvei'ed by a thin expansion of cellular substance, which might be mistaken for tendinous fibres, but it is only the cellular mem- brane condensed, and ought to be removed along with the integuments. Use : To draw down the ribs in expiration, to bend the ti'unk forwards when both muscles act, or to bend it obliquely to one side when one of them acts singly ; to raise the pelvis obliquely when the ribs are fixed ; to compress the abdominal viscera, to thrust the diaphragm upwards, to assist in the expulsion of the urine and fa:ces, and of the fcetus. Sijnonijma : Obliquus cxternus abdominis;—obli- quus( V ) *}uus descendens ;—obliquus major ;—llio pubi-cos- to-abdominal. In the course of the dissection of this smgle mus- cle, the following points must be attended to. Tl>e LiNEA Alba, a white line running along the middle of the abdomen, from the cartilago ensiformis to the OS pubis; formed by the tendinous fibres of the two obliqui and the transversalis muscles, interlaced with those of the same muscles on the opposite side; it is half an inch broad at the navel ; and decreases gradually both above and below tliat part; but par- ticularly in the latter situation, wliere it is reduced at last to a mere line. LiNEA Semilunaris, a semicircular white line, running from the os pubis obliquely upwards over the side of the abdomen, at the distance of about four inches from the linea alba ; formed by the tendons of the two oblique and transverse muscles uniting at the edge of the rectus, before they separate to form the sheath for that muscle. LiNE^ Tkansversje, three or four white linesj crossing from the linea semilunaris to the linea alba ; formed by the tendinous intersections of the recti shining through the strong sheath which covers them:—These are not evident in all subjects in this stage of the dissection., Umbilicus, or Navel. This which, before the integuments were removed, was a depression, ap- peal's now a prominence; it consists of condensed cellular membrane :—In the foetus, it was a foramen which gave passage to the two umbilical arteries, the umbilical vein, and the urachus. a 4; AnnulusC 8 ) Akkclus Aijdominalis, or Ring, an oblique slit or opening just above the angle of the pubis; formed by the tendon of the external oblique, divided into two portions called the pillars or columns of the ring, of which [the superior or internal) is attached to the symphisis, and the other (the inferior or external) to the angle of the pubis; and allowing a passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and the ligamentum teres of the uterus in the female. This slit is very impro- perly named a ring, since its figure is triangular ; the pubis is the base, the two columns are the two sides of the triangle. The apex has indeed a rounded figure in consequence of some transverse fibres, which connect the two columns where they first separate ; and it points obliquely upwards and out- wards. It belongs to the external oblique alone, there being no such opening, either in the internal oblique, or the transversalis ; it is much smaller in the female than in the male. LiGAXIENTUM INGUINALE, Seu PoupartH, SCU Fallopii, a strong ligament, stretching from the ante- rior superior spinous process of the os ilium, to be fixed to the spine of the os pubis. This in truth is merely the lower edge of the tendon of the obliquus externus abdominis, extended from the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium to the angle of the pubis, although in compliance with received notions, I have described it as a separate ligament. It covers the femoral vessels and nerves, and certain muscles, and has lately been often described under the name of the Crural Auch. It is also the same part as the posterior column of the abdominal ring. The student( 9 ) student will be much confused by this multitude of names, unless he remembers that they denote only one object; that the crural arch, the inferior or mtcr column of the abdominal ring, Ponpari's or l/ie inguinal ligament, are so many names applied to the inferior border of the tendon of the external obhque muscle of the abdomen. I would advise the student, before he proceeds to the dissection of the other abdominal muscles, to dissect the parts in the groin, and to examine the situation of the great inguinal vessels. In taking off the skin from the groin, you will not find a strong regular fascia, as on the outer part of the thigh, but a confused and irregular aponeurosis coming oft" from the abdomen, and going down tipon the thigh, strengthened by the intermixture of con- densed cellular substance, and very loose above the great vessels. Immediately under the skin, and above this apo- neurosis, you perceive the congeries of lymphatic glands, and sometimes tlie lymphatic vessels them- selves can be distinguished by their semi-transparent coats, and knotted appearance. Also, immediately vmder the skin you will find the VtNA Sapiiena run- ning from below upwards, at first lying on the fascia, and then gradually sinking through it to join the fe- moral vein, about an inch below Poupart's ligament' On removing thi'^ irregular fascia, we come down upon the great vessi ls, whi-h lie deeply imbedded in cellular substance, and are closely invested and sup- ported l)y a firm sheatli, or fascia, consisting chiefly of celKilar substance, very much condensed. This A 5 should( 10 ) should all be cautiously removed with the scissars, along with some lymphatic glands which lie amongst the fat. Observe the order in which the parts are situated under the crural arch:—that the great exter- nal iliac vein lies next to the pubis; that the exter- nal iliac artery is on the outside of this,, in close con- tact with it;—that the anterior crural nerve is half an inch exterior to the artery, and lies on the illacus internus ; and that the outer half of the space Ifeft tinder the crural arch is filled by the psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles. Observe how the cru- ral arch is stretched over the parts just enumerated; ■—how it forms a thin, but firm, sharp and crescent- shaped edge towards the pubis (constituting the seat of stricture in the femoral hernia, and sometimes called Gimhernat's ligament) ;—how the artery is placed in relation to the angle of the pubis and spine of the ilium;—how it passes under the middle of the arch, and, before it has fairly emerged into the thigh, sends off two considerable branches. (1.) A. CiRCUMFLEXA Ilii is Sent off from the outside, passes upwards and outwards, runs along the inside of Poupart's ligament, till it arrives at the ante- rior superior spinous process ofthe os ilium; thence it is continued along the inside of the spine of the ilium, lying close upon the bone between the trans- versalis abdominis and the upper edge of the iliacus internus, to both of which it gives twigs, and ends in inosculating with the ileo-lurabar artery. That distribution, however, cannot be seen in this stage of the dissection. (2.) A, Epigastrica comes off from the inside of the( H ) the artery, crosses the external iliac vein, passes obliquely upwards and inwards, under Poupart's li- gament, to which it is but loosely connected, and runs behind the upper extremity of the abdominal ring and spermatic cord, to reach the rectus abdo- minis. At first it is situated between the posterior surface of that muscle and the peritoneum, but higher up between the muscular fibres and the sheath. It terminates in ramifications, which supply the rectus, and which inosculate with the ramifications of the mammaria interna, sent down from the thorax on each side of the sternum. The dissection of the other abdominal muscles may now be continued. Dissect off the serrated origin of the external ob- lique from the ribs, and from the spine of the os ilium, and detach it from the obliquus internus, which lies below it, and which is connected to it by loose celluf lar substance, and by small vessels. Continue to separate the two muscles, till you find their tendons firmly attached, i. e. a little way beyond the linea se^ milunaris. Separate the tendon from the crural arch to within half an inch of the abdominal ring. 2. Obliuuus Ascendens Internus.—Arises by short tendinous fibres, which soon become fleshy, from the whole length of the spine of the os ilium, and from the fascia lumborum * ; also fleshy from tl^e * Some describe il as arising fi om tlie saenini and three in- ferior lambar vertebrx ; bul this is not accurate, l.t arises from a Icndiiious fascia coiiinion to it and to ,eert:iiu muscles of the'back, as the serrauis posticus inferior 5 this inay with j>roi)rjety be named fuscio Lutnhwwn. A. Q upper( 12 ) upper part of Poupart's ligament at the part next t& the OS ilium. The fibres run in a radiated direction; those T^-hida originate from the back-part of the os ilium, run obliquely upwards ; those from the fore-part of the ilium pass more transversely across the belly ; and from Poupart's ligament the fibres descend. The fleshy belly is continued rather more forward than Uiat of the external oblique, before it terminates in a flat tendon. Inserted into the cartilages of the six or sevwi lower ribs,—fleshy into the three inferior, and, by a tendinous expansion, which is extremely thin, re. sembling cellular membrane, into the four superior, and also into the ensiform cartilage. The sheet of tendon in which the fleshy belly ends, is continued, single and undivided, into the linea semilunaris, where, adhering pretty firmly to the tendons of the obliquus extern us and transversalis, it divides into two layere. The anterior and more consider- able layer joins the tendon of the external oblique, nnd runs over the rectus to be inserted into the whole length of the Knea alba: the posterior and thinner layer, adhering to the anterior surface of the transversalis, passes into the linea alba be- hind the rectus, as low 'as half-wa}"- between the umbilicus and os pubis; but below this place the whole tendon of the internal oblique passes along with that of the external oblique before the rec- tus, and is inserted into the lower part of the linea alba. The inferior edge of the muscle extends in a nearly straight direction over the spermatic chord to bo( 13 ) be fixed by a tendinous attachment to the angle ot the pubis. Situation : It is covered by the obliquus descen- dens externus and latissimus dorsi. Use: To assist the obliquus externus: but it bends the trunk in the reverse direction, so that the muscle on each side co-operates with the obli- quus externus of the opposite side, SynoJiyma: Obliquus internus abdominis;—ob- liquus ascendens ;—obliquus minor;—ilio-lumbo- costi-abdominal. About the middle of Poupart's ligament, a deli- cate fasciculus of fibres is sent off from this muscle •ver the spermatic cord, where it passes under its edge in its way to the ring. This is named the CfiEMASTER, and is continued down to the cord^ till it is insensibly lost on the tunica vaginalis testis ; it will beseen'jn the dissection of the scrotum: Its use is to suspend, draw up, and compress the testicle. We must now dissect the attachments of the in- ternal oblique from the cartilages of the ribs, from the fascia lumborum, and from the spine of the os ilium, and, by continuing our dissection from behind forwards, separate it from the tranversalis abdominis, which lies under it. This separation may be conti- nued as far as where the tendons of the two muscles are inseparable, i. e. rather more forward than the Hnea semilunaris. As this muscle lies very close upon the transversalis, caution is required to avoid detach- ing both muscles together. Let the student begin his separation at the crista of the ilium, where the course of the circumflexa ilii artery and vein will • " shew( 1* ) shew him when he has arrived at the surface of the transversalis. 3. Transversalis Abdominis.—Arises, tendi- nous, from the fascia lumborum, and back part of the spine of the os ilium ; flesliy from all the remaining part of the spine of the ilium, and from the inner sur- face of Poupart's ligament; and fleshy from the inner or back part of the cartilages of the seven lower ribs, « where its fibres meet those of the diaphragm. The fleshy fibres proceed transversely, and end in a flat sheet of tendon, which, after being connected to the other tendons at the linea semilunaris, passes with the posterior layer of the internal oblique be- hind the rectus, and is inscried mio the ensiform car- tilage, and into the whole length of the linea alba, excepting its lowermost part; for, at the middle dis- tance between the umbilicus and os pubis, a slit or fissure is formed in this tendon, through which the rectus abdominis passes ; and the remainder of the tendon passes before the rectus, to be inserted into the lower part of the linea alba. Its inferior edge is connected with that of the preceding muscle in its insertion into the pubis. Situation : It is covered by the obliquus descea- dens internus, and is lined by the peritoneum. Use: To support and compress the viscera of the abdomen. Si/nouyma: Transversus abdominis;—lumbo-ili- abdominal. Where the transversalis is detached from its origins, and turned back towards the linea semilunaris, the peritoneum is laid bare, except in the neighbourhood <) of( 15 ) of the crural arch, where it is covered by a thin fascia arising from Poupart's ligament, and continued up- wards between the peritoneum and transversalis mus- cle, until it is gradually lost. This is named by Mr. Astley Cooper, its discoverer, thefascia transversalis, and prevents the bowels from being protruded under the inferior margins of the obliquus internusand trans - versalis muscles. It is perforated about the middle between the ilium and pubes, by an opening for the -passage of the spermatic chord, which then goes ob- liquely downwards inwards and forwards to the ring of the external oblique. Thus the abdominal ring is a canal, having an upper or internal opening, formed in the fascia transversalis, and a lower or external one in the tendon of the obliquus externus *. The -sheath of the rectus is now to be attended to; it is formed by the tendons of the three other mus- cles, viz. the two obliqui, and the transversalis: These, when they reach the edge of the rectus, form the appearance named Linea Semilunaris ; they then split and inclose the rectus in their duplicature ; the whole tendon of the external oblique, with the ante- rior layer of the internal oblique, passes before the rectus; and the whole posterior layer of the internal oblique, together with the whole tendon of the trans- versalis muscles passes behind the rectus, excepting at the lower part; but, for two or three inches above the pubis, all the tendons go in front of the muscle, * For more complete descriptions of these very important parts, see Mr. Cooper's Works on Hernia, or iMr. Lawrence's Treatise on the same subject. and( 16 ) and the posterior part of the slieath is consequently deficient, the rectus lying naked on the peritoneum. The two oblique muscles are now to be replaced; then, making an incision by the side of the linea alba, and thus opening the sheath of the rectus through its whole length, you dissect it back towards the linea semilunaris,- and thus lay bare the fibres of the muscle next to be described. 4. Rectus Abdominis.—A7-ises,hy a flat tendon, from the fore-part of the os pubis ; as it ascends, its fleshy belly becomes broader and thinner. Inserted, by a thin fleshy expansion, into the ensi- form cartilage, and into the cartilages of the three inferior true ribs. Sitifatmi: This pair of muscles is situated on each side of the linea alba, under the tendons of the ob- lique muscles. The muscle is generally divided by three tendinous intersections ; the first is at the um- bilicus, the second where it runs over the cartilage of the seventh rib, and the third in the middle between these; and there is commonly a half intersection below the umbilicus. J^}' tiiese intersections, the muscle is connected firmly to the interior part of its sheath, forming the line^s; XRANSVERs^ffi; while it adheres very slightly by loose cellular substance to the posterior layer. Use: To compress the fore-part of the abdomen, to bend the trunk forwards, or to raise the pelvis. Synonijma: Piibio-sternal. On each side of the linea alh;;, and inclosed in the lower part of the sheath of the rectus, is some- times found a small mutjcle, named 5. Pyra-( 17 J 5, PvRAMiDALrs.—Or/gin: Tendinous and fleshy, ©f the breadth of an inch from the os pubis, ante- rior to the origin of the rectus. Insertion : By an acute termination, near half-way between the os pubis and umbilicus, into the linea alba and inner edge of the rectus muscle. Siluation: It lies betwixt the lower portion of the two recti muscles. Use : To assist the lower part of the rectus. Synonyma : Pyraraidalis, vel succenturiatus, pu- bio-umbilical. SISSECTION OF THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. ''HE abdomen is divided into three regions, ^ach of which is again subdivided. 1. The Epigastric, or upper region, includes the part covered at the side by the ribs ; its lateral portions are named the right and left HypocHON- dria, and the depression in its middle the scrobi- cuius cordis. 2. The Umbii.ical, or middle region, is the space immediately under the former; and it ex- tends below to the anterior superior spines of the ilia. Its sides are called the lumbar or iliac regions. 3. The Hypogastric, or lowest region, is sub- divided into three parts, one middle, termed Re- SECT. II.( 18 ) c.to Pubis, ami two lateral, named Inguinal regions. Make a longitudinal incision from the scrobi- culus cordis to the umbilicus, and from that point an oblique incision on each side towards the ante- rior spinous process of the os ilium, forming thuE three triangular flaps. In doing this, avoid cutting the intestines, by raising the muscles from them after the first puncture. Before you disturb the viscera, observe the gene- ral situation of those parts which appear on the first opening of the abdomen. 1. The internal surface of the PERiT0NE;>5f, smooth, shining, and colourless, covering thg^' pa- rietes of the abdomen, and the surface of i.i-tlis viscera. ' 2. In the triangular portion of integumen^ folded down over the pubes, three ligamentous cords pro- ject through the peritoneum, two running laterally, and the other in the middle, towards the navel. 'J'hese are the remains of the two umbilical arteries and the urachus. 3. The epigastric artery, accompanied by two veins, may be seen through the peritoneum, ascend- ing obliquely upwards and inwards from under Pou- part's ligament. <t. The upper edge of the liver is seen extending from the right hypochondriac region, across the epigastric, into the left hypochondriac region ; in it a fissure is seen, into which enters, inclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, the ligamcntum teres, which was, in the foetus, the umbilical vein. The fundus( 19 ) fundus of the gall-bladder if distended, is sometimes seen projecting from under the edge of the liver. 5. The Stomach will be found lying in the left hypochondriac region, and upper part of the e^)i- gastric; but, if distended, it protrudes into the um- bilical region. 6. The GuEAT Omentum proceeds from the great curvature of the stomach, and stretches down hke a flap over the intestines. ' 7. The Great Transveuse Arch of the Co- lon will be seen projecting through the omentum ; it mounts up from the os ilium of the right side, crosses the belly under the edge of the liver, and under the greater curvature of the stomach, and descending again upon the left side, sinks under the small intestines, and rests upon the wing of the left or ilium. 8. The Small Intestines lie convoluted in the lower part of the belly, surrounded by the arch of the colon. Such is the general appearance on first opening the abdomen; but this vvill -vary somewhat, as one intestine may happen to be more inflated than ano- ther,^ or as the position of the body may have been after death. It will now be proper to consider the parts more minutely. 1. The Peritoneum—Observe how it is reflected from the parietes of the abdomen over all the viscera, 60 that they may be said to be situated behind it; trace its reflections from side to side, and from above downwards; you will see that the external coat of every( 20 ) every viscus, and all the connecting ligaments, are reflections or Continuations of this membrane. (1.) The FOUR Ligaments of the Liver are formed by the peritoneum, continued from the dia- phragm and parietes of the abdomen. a. The Middle or Suspensory Ligament, in- closing in its duplicate the Ligamentum Teres. b. The Coronary Ligament, connecting th« upper surface of the Liver to the diaphragm. c. The Broad Ligament of the right side, c?, The Broad Ligament of the left side. (2.) The Lesser Omentum, or Epiploon, or the Mesogastrion, is formed by two laminae of pe- ritoneum, passing from the under surface of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and contain- ing in its duplicate the vessels of the liver. (3.) The Great Epiploon or Omentum.— Observe, that the peritoneum, coming from both sur- faces of the stomach, and from the spleen, proceeds downwards into the abdomen, and is then reflected back upon itself, till it reaches the transverse arch of the colon, where its laminae separate to invest that intestine. This reflection is named the Great Omen- tum ; it is a pouch or bag, composed of four laminae of peritoneum, and the opening into it is by the Fo- ramin of Winslow: Observe the situation of this semilunar opening; it is on the right side of the ab- domen, at the root of the lesser lobe, or lobulus spi- gelii of the liver; it loads under the little epiploon, under the posterior surface of the stomach, but above the pancreas and colon, into the sac of the omentum; —the omentum sometimes reaches to the lower part of( 21 ) of the hypogastric region, sometimes not be3'ond the navel; it contains in its duplicature more or less of adipose substance. (4.) The Mesentery.—Observe, that the peri, toneum, reflected from each side of the vertebrae, proceeds forward, to connect the intestines loosely to the spine ; that it begins opposite to the first lum- bar vertebra, crosses obliquely from left to right, and ends half-way between the last lumbar vertebra and the groin. At its commencement, it binds down the extremity of the duodenum, and it terminates where the head of the colon begins. 1"he great circumference which is in contact with the intes- tines, is very much plaited or folded, and is several yards in length. Between the laminae of mesentery, observe the Conglobate Glands, less numerous in old age : the branches of the superior mesenteric artery ramifying and forming arches; the mesen- teric veins accompanying the arteries ; the trunk of the lacteals, situated contiguous to the mesenteric artery on its left side. It may somi times be in- flated by the biow-pipe. Nerves also run in the mesentery, but are not easily demonstrated. (5.) The Mesocolon is similar to the mesentery, and connects, in like manner, the colon to the spine. 2. Hepar, the Liver.—Situation: Partly in the right hypochondrium, which it fills up, reaching as low as the kindney of that side, partly in the epi- gastrium, and running also some way into the left hypochondrium. Connected by its four ligaments to the inferior sur- face of the diaphragm, and by the lesser epiploon to tiie small curvature of the stomach:—The little epiploon( 22 ) epiploon should now be removed, to discover the different parts of the liver. Observe the superior or convex surface adapted to the arch of the diaphragm ; the inferior or concave surface resting on the stomach ;—the posterior or thick edge lying against the vertebrae, and the ante- rior thin margin cotTesponding to the lower edge of the chest;—Observe the three lobes of the liver;— the great or right lobe ;—the small or left lobe;— the lobulus spigclii;—the great fissure, separating the right and left lobe, and receiving the suspensory ligament, and the ligamentum teres ;—the cavily of the portae between the great lobe and lobulus spige- lii;—the fissure on the right side of the lobulus for the vena cava inferior, which fissure is almost a complete foramen ;—the notch in the back-part for the vertebras;—the depression in the right lobe for the gall-bladder. Observe the vessels in the cavity of the portse, the hepatic artery on the left side, the ductus communis choledochus on the right side, and betwixt, but at the same time behind them, the vena portae; they are all surrounded by a plexus of nerves. These vessels ^md nerves pass along the edge of the mesogaster, or little omentum, sur- rounded and connected by adipose and cellular substance-; the part is called Capsula Gussoxr. Observe that the ligamentum teres was the umbi- lical vein of the fcetus, entering the vena portre, and that the ductus venosus in the foetus, (oblite- rated in the adult), leaving the vena portae, passed into one of the venae cava; hcpatica?. 3. Vesicula Fellis, the Gall.Bladder.— Situation : In the right hypochondrium, in a super- ficial «( 23 ) ficial depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the h'ver: it sends off the Ductus Cys- tic us, which, uniting with the Ductus Hepa- TICU3, forms the Ductus Communis Choledo- CHus ; this perforates the first curvature of the duodenum. 4. Ventriculus, the Stomach.—Situation: In the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions: Connected to part of the interior surface of the diaphragm, to the concave surface of the liver by the little epiploon, to the spleen by a reflection of peritoneum, and to the arch of the colon by the great omentum. Observe its greater curvature look- ing downwards, its lesser curvature looking up- wards ; and its two lateral surfaces. In the living body, the greater curvature is turned forward, and a little downward, the lesser arch backward, i. e. towards the spine, while one of the lateral convex sides is turned upwards, and the other downwards. Observe the bulging extremity on the left side, the cardia or upper orifice, where the oesophagus enters Jialf-way between this great extremity and the lesser arch: the pylorus, or lower orifice, at the end of the small extremity, situated under the liver, and rather to the right side of the spine, feeling hard when touched. 5. The Intestines.—These form one continuous tube, but are divided into two portions, differing in their figure, structure, and functions, and distin- guished by the names of small and large. The small intestine is divided into duodenum, je- junum, and ileum; the large into caecum, colon, and rectum. (1.) Small( 24 ) (1.) Small Intestine ;—about four times the length of the body. c, The Duodenum is broader than any other part of the small intestine, but is short; it takes a turn from the pylorus upwards, and to the right side, passing under the liver and gall-bladder; then, tarning upon itself, it descends, passing as low as the right kidney; it is in this space that it receives the pancreatic and gall ducts; thence it crosses before the renal vessels, before the aorta, and upon the last vertebra of the back, firmly bound down by the peritoneum, which covers only its anterior sur- face ; it then ascends from right to left, till it is lost under the root of the mesocolon. Turning back the colon and omentum, fi.\ing them over the brim of the thorax, and pushing down the small intestines towards the pelvis, you find the duodenum coming out from under the me- socolon, but still tied close to the spine; it termi- nates in the jejunum, exactly where the mesentery beginsv The intestine in this com-se forms nearly a circle, the root of the mesocolon being the only part lying between its two extremities. You have now to trace the rest of the small in- testine, which lies convoluted in the umbilical and hypogastric regions. b, Jejunum constitutes the first or upper half of the remaining small intestine, and is situated more in the upper part of the abdomen ; it is redder, and its coats feel thicker to the touch, from the greater number of the valvulas conniventes on its inner surface; its diameter exceeds that of the ilium. c, The( 25 ) c, The lower half is named Ileum ; it Is situated more in the lower part of the abdomen, and termi- nates in the great intestine, by entering the caput coli, or beginning of the colon. As a general observation it may be said, that the convolutions of the small intestine occupy the middle of the umbilical and hypogastric regions ; but their situation varies much, particularly according to the State of the bladder and rectum. The course of the tube, independently of its convolutions, is from the left lumbar region, where the duodenum emerges from under the mesocolon to the right inguinal re- gion, where the ileum terminates in the caput coli. (2.) Great intestine. d, The Cmcvm, or blind gut, is tied down by the peritoneum to the loins on the z'ight side, lying in the space under the right kidney, hid by the convo- lutions of the ileum. On its posterior part there is a little appendage, of the shape of an earth-worii% named Appendix Cceci Vermijhrmis, e, The Colon.—Its commencement at the csecuox is termed Caput Coli, or head of the colon ; it mounts upwards from the caecum over the anterior surface of the right kidney, to which it is connected by cellular substance, passes under the gall-bladder, which, after death, tinges it with bile; and thea, going across the upper part of the belly, forms its Great Transveuse Arch. In its whole course it is contracted into cells by its muscular fibres, which are united together, forming longitudinal bands; and it has eorae fatty projections attached to its surface, named Appendices Epiploicae. Both these circum- B stance*( 26 ) ^tinces distinguish the large from the gniall intestine; which the difference of size does not always. When the large intestine is empty, it contracts, and may be even smaller than the small; but if it were inflated, it could be distended to a much greater|degree. The colon then goes backwards under the stomach and spleen into the left hypochondriura ; and then, de- scending over the left kidney, it is again tied down ; it afterwards turns over the brim of the pelvis, being at this part unconfined, and forming a loose and re- markable curvature, which is named the Sigmoid or Iliac Fltkuiie. After this convolution, the intestine assumes the name of The Rectum.—Drawing aside the intestines, you find the gut continued over the anterior surface of the sacrum and os coccygis to the anus. On pijlling the stomach towards the right side, you will perceive, 6. The Lien, or Spleen.—•Situation: In the left hypochondriac region, between the great extremity of the stomach, and the neighbouring false ribs, un- der the edge of the diaphragm, and above the left kidney ; to all of which it is connected by the perito- neum. It is of an oval figure; its external surface is gently convex; its internal surface irregularly concave, and divided by a longitudinal fissure, into which its vessels enter. 7. The Pancreas.—Situation : This gland was in part seen on removing the little epiploon; it is more fully exposed, by tearing through ?hc great epiploon between the great curvature of the stomach, and the transverse arch of the colon. It lies in the c.ivity into( 27 ) Into which the foramen of Winslow leads : it crttends from the fissure of the spleen across the spine, under the posterior surface of the stomach, and terminates within the circle formed by the duodenum; it is only covered on its anterior surface by tlie peritoneum. The Pancreatic Duct pierces the coat of the duodenum, and enters the cavity of that intestine, by an orifice common to it, and to the ductus communis choledochus. The duct runs along the very centre of the gland, where the whiteness of its coats will readily enable the student to distinguish it. All the abdominal viscera may now be removed, except the rectum, where it descends into the pelvis, which, being tied, shouW be allowed to remain, for it belongs to the demonstration of those parts: Or the liver and its vessels, with the pancreas, may be left, and the vessels entering the portas of the liver traced. The peritoneum should now be carefully dissected from the diaphragm, and from the sides and back part of the abdomen; thus the parts which lie more imme- diately behind that membrane may be examined. 8. Renes, the KinNEVs.—Two glandular bodies, situated in the posterior part of the cavity of the ab- domen, on each side of the lumbar vertebra;, between the last false rib and the spine of the ileum, and im- bedded in a quantity of adipose membrane. In each kidney you may observe a lesser arch or concavity turned obliquely forwards and. inwards ; a grcaterarch or convexity turned obliquely backward;? and outwards ;—two lateral surfaces;—two extremi- fces, the superior of which is nearer to that of the op- B 2 posite( 28 ) posite kidney than the inferior. Observe the renal or emulgent artery entering the lesser arch, the vein and ureter passing out. Observe the course of the ureter; it passes behind the peritoneum over the psoas mus- cle into the pelvis, and runs between the rectum and bladder, which last it enters. 9. The Capsule Renales.—Two glandular bo- dies, situated on the upper extremity of each kidney, of an irregular figure, crescent-like, or somewhat ■triangular. By the removal of the peritoneum, several muscles are exposed, situated at the superior and posterior parts of the abdomen. One single muscle is situated in the superior part of the abdomen. DiAPHRAGMA, the DiAPHRAGM, Or MiDRIFF.— This is a broad, thin, muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, situated obliquely; it is con- cave below, and convex above, the middle of it on each side reaching as high within the thorax as the fourth rib. It is divided into two portions: 1. The superior or greater muscle of thediaphragm, forms the transverse partition between the chest and abdomen. Arising, by distinct fleshy fibres, 1. From the pos- terior surface of the ensifovm cartilage; 2. Frura the cartihiges of the seventh, and all the false ribs; S. From the ligamentum arcuatum, which is a liga- ment extended, somewhat indistinctly, from the top of the twelfth rib to the lumbar vertebrae, forming an arch over the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles.( 29 ) muscles. From these origins the fibres run^ in dif ferent directions, like radii from the circumference to the center of a circle, and are Inserted into a broad tendon, (tendinous centre, or cordiform tendon,) which is situated in the middle of the diaphragm, and in which, therefore, the fibres from the opposite sides are interlaced. 2. The inferior or lesser muscle, or appendix of the diaphragm, lies on the bodies of the vertebrse, «nd AriseSy by four small tendinous feet, on each sidep from the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebrse ; these tendons soon join, to form a strong pillar oa each side, named the Crus of the Diaphragm. The crura run obliquely upwards and forwards, form twa fleshy bellies, a fasciculus of each of which crossing over to the other, decussates with the oppossite otxq^ and thus forms the interval of the two crura into a superior and inferior opening. Inserted into the posterior part of the middle cor- diform tendon. Situation : The diaphragm is covered on its supe* rior surface by the pleura, and on its inferior by the peritoneum; it separates the thoracic from the abdo° minal viscera : It is perforated in its fleshy and teni dinous parts by several blood-vessels, and other im- portant organs. (1.) The aorta passes between the tendinous part of the crura, lying close upon the spine; and the thoracic duct passes betwixt the aorta and the right «rus. {%) A little above, and to the left side of the aorta, B $ the( 30 ) the oesophagus, with the eight pair of nerves at" tached to it, passes through an oval fissure formed in the fleshy columns of the inferior muscle. These two part« are separated by the decussating fasciculi just described. (3.) The vena cava perforates the tendon towards the right side by a triangular hole. (4.) The posterior intercostal nerve, and branches of the vena azygos, perforate some of the posterior fibres of the crura:—The splanchnic, or anterior in- tercostal nerve, also passes through an opening in the substance of the crura. (5.) On each side of the sternum there is a small fissure, where the perit-oneum and pleura are only separated by adipose membrane. Use: The diaphragm is one of the chief agents in respiration ; in contraction it enlarges the cavity of the thorax, and produces inspiration; in expiration it is relaxed, and pushed up by the pressure of the vis- cera, from the action of the muscles of the abdomen, so as to diminish the cavity of the chest: it also acta in coughing, laughing, and speaking, and in the ex- pulsion of the urine and fasces. Hynonyma : Septum transversum ;—septum mus, cularc ;—Thoraco abdominal. Winslow calls the middle aponeurosis the aponeurotic plane of the diaphragm ; by others it is called the centrum tendi' nosum. Four pair of muscles are situated within the pos- erior part of the cavity of the abdomen. I. The Psoas Pauvus.—It arises, fleshy, front \vi sides of the last dorsal, and first lumbar vertebra?; it( 31 ) it sends off a small long tendon, which, running on the inside of the psoas magnus, is Inserted, thin and flat^into the brim of the pelvic, at the junction of the os iliuiti and pubis. Situation : This muscle lies on tlie anterior part of the loins, betwixt the psoas magnus and the verte- brae; sometimes, however, it is wanting. Use: To assist the psoas magnus in bending the loins forward: in some positions, it will bend the pelvis on the loins. Synonyma: Pre-lumbo pubien. 2. The Psoas Magnus.—It arises, fleshy, from the side of the body, and transverse process of the last vertebra of the back, and in the same manner from all those of the loins, by as many distinct slips^ It I'uns down over the brim of the pelvis, and is Inserted, tendmous, into the trochanter minor of the OS femoris, and fleshy, into that bone immediate- ly below the trochanter. Situation : It is situated betwixt the psoas parvuJ and iliacus internus, close to the fore-part and sides, of the lumbar vertebrae : at its origin it has some con- nection with the diaphragm, and with the quadratus^ lumborura. Use : To bend the thigh forwards, and roll itout- v/ards; or, when the inferior extremity is fixed, to assist in bending the body. Synonyma : Lumbaris internus—Pre-Iumbo-tro- chantin. 3. The Iliacus Internus.—It arises, flesh}', fromt the transverse process of the last vertebra of the loins, from all the inner margin of the spine of the os ileum^- B ^ fronftC 32 ) from the edge of that bone between its anterior su- perior spinous process and the acetabdum, and from all its hollow part between the spine and the linea innominata. Its fibres descend under the outer half of Poupart's ligament, and join the tendon of the psoas magnus, Inserted with the psoas magnus. Situation: It fills up the internal concave surface of the OS ileum, and is situated on the outside of the psoas magnus. It is covered by a pretty strong fascia, which is inserted into the crista of the ileum, and into the crural arch: Fascia Iliaca. The latter inser- tion prevents the bowels from descending under Poupart's ligament, except at the inner edge of the iliac vein, which is accordingly the situation of the crural hernia, and which the student should examine most carefully, A part of this fascia is also continued behind the femoral vessels over the pubis, to form a part of the sheath which encloses those vessels*. Use: To assist in bending the thigh, and in bring- ing it directly forwards. Synonyma: Iliacho-trochantin. 2V. B. The insertion of the two last-described mus- cles cannot be seen till the thigh is dissected, when it will be found to lie between the vastus internus and the pectina^us. 4. TheQuADKATUs Lumborum.—This muscle arises, tendinous and floshy, from rather more than the posterior third part of the spine of the os ileum. • Sec the second part of Mr. Coopcr i worii on Hernia, and Mr. Lawreucc't treatise qucied bcfutc. Inserted{ 33 ) Inserted into the transverse processes of all the ver- tebrae of the loins, into the posterior half of the last rib, and, by a small tendon, into the side of the last vertebra of the back. Situation : It is situated laterally at the lower part of the spine, more outwardly than the psoas magnus, between the origin of the psoas and the transversalis abdominis. Use : To move the loins to one side, pull down the last rib, and, when both muscles act, to bend the loins forwards. Synoiiyma: Lumbaris externus;—Ilio-lumbl-costal. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES SITUATED BEHIND THE PERITONEUM. l.THE ARTERlliS, "VIZ. THE AORTA ABDOMI- NALIS, AND ITS BRANCHES*. The Aorta passes from the thorax into the abdo- men, between the crura of the diaphragm, close upon the spine. It then descends on the fore-part of the vertebrae, lying not exactly in the middle, but rather inclined to the left side. On the fourth lumbar ver- * In the description of the blood-vessels, the ramifications cf the principal trunks are enumerated ; but the student must remember that these can be seen only when injected, and when the subject ia dissected for the express purpiise of tracing tlis arteries. In an ordinary dissection, the trunks only can be «le«iuu:trHted, * 5 tebra,( 3^ ) tebra, it bifurcates into the two primitive or coninion iliac arteries. Branches of the Abdominal Aohta. l.The two Phrenic Arteries arise from the Aorta* before it has fairly entered into the abdomen, and ramify over the diaphragm; sometimes they come off in one trunk, which bifurcates ; sometimes one of tliera arises from the coeHac. 2. The CcELiAc Artery comes off at the point where the aorta has fairly extricated itself from the dia- phragm ; it is a single, large, but short trunk situated between the inferior surface of the liver, and the small curvature of the stomach, and surrounded by the meshes of the semilunar ganglion. It divides at once inbo three branches ; and as they depart in dif-^ ferent directions from one point, as from a centre, the trunk is called the Axis Arteri^ Cceliac-i; (I.) A. CoRONARiA Vkntriculi, the middle branch, is the smallest of the three; it passes from the axis towards the left side, and arriving at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it attaches itself to that organ, sends a branch round the cardia, named Ramus Cor onarice Dexter. The trunk itself is then continued' along the lesser curvature from left to right, to inos- culate with the pylorica or coronaria dextra: it sends off branches to the little epiploon,&c. It sometimes terminates in the liver, entering at the porta?, and then it is the largest of the branches of the coeliac. In this case, the trunk, after ascending towards the left to reach the cardia, is reflected to the right, in its( 35 ) its way to the liver; and, at tlie point of reflection,, gives ofF the coron. vcnlric. ( ) Artehia Splenica leaving the trunk of" the cosliac, goes directly to tlie side,.passes under the stomach, and along tlie upper border of the pancreas,, running in a tortuous and serpentine course ^it enters tlie left concave surface of the spleen in several branches, but, before doing so,, it gives off the follow- ing branches; tt, Pancreatige ParvjE to the pancreas, where it runs along the border of that viscus. h, Vasa Brevia to the bulging extremity of the stomach. c, A. Gastro-epiploica Sinistra, which run along the greater curvature of the stomach,, inoscu- lating with tlie gastro-epiploica dextra. ( 3. ) Arteria Hepatic a runs in a direction opr posite to the splenic,, towards the right side; but not more than half of its blood goes to the liver: Itsends off the following br-anches u a, Pylorica, or Coronaria Dextra,, some- time.s comes off from the trunk of the hepatic, some- times from one of its branches;—reaching the py- loric end of tlie stomach, it sends its ramifications along the lesser curvature, to inosculate with the proper coronary artery. b, Gastro-epiploica Dextra, or Gastro- duodenalis, passes under the pylorus, to reach the- great curvature of the stomach, along which it runs,, inosculating with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, and sending branches upwards to the stomach,and down- wards to the omentum; it also supplies the upper. li 6 parfc.f ^ } part of the duodeauni, and cends off a considerable branch to the right extremity of the pancreas. The hepatic artery then divides into the right dnd left hepatic. The Right is distributed to tht right lobe of the liver, and to the gall-bladder. The LiEVT supplies the whole of the left lobe, the lobulus Spigelii, and part of the right lobe of the liver. 3. The Superior Mesenteric Artery is a single trunk ; it leaves the aorta about half an inch lower than the coeliac artery,—it comes out from un- der the mesocolon, and stretches over the duode- num ; it enters the fold of peritoneum forming the mesentery, and runs down in this, gradually incur- Yating from the left to the right side. From the right side or concavity of this arch, three branches are given to the colon. (1.) A. Ileo-Colica runs down to the caput coli and last turns of the ileum; its branches upon the small intestines inosculate with those branches of the superior mesenteric distributed to the small in- testines in general; and on the great intestine, it inosculates with the next branch. ( 2.) A. CoLiCA DEXTRA.—This artcry runs frora the root of the superior mesenteric artery, across to- wards the right side of the colon, wl>ere that intes- tine begins to rise over the kidney. ( 3.) A. CoLicA Media.—This branch goes di- rectly upwards from the trunk of the superior me- (senteric, as it comes out from under the mesocolon. After running a little way upon the mesocclon, it divides; and the division going towards the right <ide, 4( 37 ) side, makes a large inosculation with the colica dextra, while the left branch makes an opposit* sweep, and joins the colica sinistra, which ia a branch of the inferior mesenteric. Often there are only two branches instead of these three; viz. ileo-colica and colica dextra ; then the c. media is a branch of the latter. Frequently too there is only one branch, called colica dextra, and dividing after its origin into the three above named. The left side or convexity of the arch of the superior mesenteric sends off from sixteen or twenty branches, which, after forming frequent anastomoses and arches, proceed to the small intestines. 4. The Renal or Emulgent Arteries are two in number. Each artery arising, below the supe- rior mesenteric, from the side of the aorta, passes to the kidney, and after having given twigs to the renal capsule and adipose membrane, enters the lesser arch of the kidney. The right artery is longer than the left, and passes behind the vena cava ascendens. 5. The Spermatic Arteries are also two; they come off about an inch below the emulgent from the fore-part of the aorta. Each artery descends behind the peritoneum, giving twigs to the parts in its course, and accompanied by the spermatic vein and nerves. It then passes through the abdominal ring, and enters the upper part of the testicle in five or six branches. In the female it supplies the evaria and fundus uteri. 6. The Inferior Mesenteric is a single trunk, v/hich comes off jrather from the left side of the aorta.( 28 ) aorta, below the spermatic arteries ; it passes in the mesentery to the left side of the abdomen, where it divides as follows. (1.) The Coi.icA Sinistra, an artery which ascends along the left side of the colon, to inos- culate with the A. Colica Media. (2.) Branches which pass to the sigmoid flexure. (3.) The great trunk of the artery runs down behind the rectum, on which it ramifies largely, and is termed Akt. Hemorrhoidalis Interna. 7. The Lumbar Arteries are five or six small arteries on each side,, which arises from the back- part of the aorta, and ar« distributed to the spinal canal, peritoneum, muscles of tlie spine, and of the sides of the abdomen and, pelvis. They inosculate with the A. Epigastrica, Circumflexa ilii, &c. 8. A. Sacra Media is a single artery, arises from the back-part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the anterior surface of the sa- crum, giving twigs to ail tlie neighbouring parts. At the fourth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifurr cates into the two primitive or common iliacs. The Iliac A Communis runs along the edge of ' the psoas muscle, and at an inch or two from its origin divides into, (1.) The Internal Iliac, which passes do^vn into the pelvis. (2.) The External Iliac, which following the direction of the psoas muscle, passes under Pou- jpart's ligament, and becomes the inguinal artery. 2. VEINS.( 39 ) 2. VEINS. The Vena Cava Abdominalis, vel Inferior, is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins, it passes up through the abdomen on the lum- bar vertebrae, and on tlie right side of the aorta. In this course it receives the following veins, which resemble their corresponding arteries : 1. The Lumbar Veins. 2. The Emulgent or Renal Veins;—the left is the longest, as it crosses over the fore-part of the aorta. 3. The Right Spermatic Vein;—the left enters , the left renal vein. The vena cava then passes through the fissure of the liver, being nearly, surrounded by that viscus, and receiving three branches from it, called the Ven^e Hepatic^. It then perforates the dia- phragm, and enters the thorax. The common iliac vein of each side is formed by the union of two branches, the External and In- ternal Iliac Veins, which accompany the arte- ries of the same name: —The common iliac vein of each side lies on the inside of its artery; hence both veins cross behind the right iliac artery, to unite and form the vena cava, on- the fore-part of the lumbar vetebrae *. • It may be here proper to observe, that generally a great- >ein accompanies every great artery ; but when the ramifica- tions become tmall, each artery ia attended by two veins. The( 4.0 ) f do not join the cava, but are united behind the pancreas, to form The Superior Mesen- the Vena Portal. This TERic Vein, the Inferior vein ramifies anew Mesenteric Vein, and the i through the Hver, and Splenic Vein, its blood is returned into the vena cava by the venae cavae hepa- ticee. Although the trunks just enumerated are the chief veins that contribute to form the vena portas, yet the returning veins of all the viscera enclosed in the peritoneum, except the liver, are included in the same system, and join one or other of the large trunks. This is the ease with the stomach, pan- creas, gall-bladder, and omentum. The blood which goes to the spleen, large and small intes- tines, is all returned by the three great trunks. 3. NERVES. 1. The eighth pair, or Par Vagum, descending on each side of the oesophngus through the diaphragm, forms the two Stomachic Plexu!?es on the ante- rior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. These plexuses send some branches to the cceliac, to the hepatic, and to the splenic plexus. 2. The Splanchnic Nerve, or Anterior Inter- costal, a branch sent off by the intercostal nerve in the thorax, enters the abdomen betwijit the crura of the diaphragm ; here each nerve forms a Semi- LBNAR Ganglion by the side of the cceliac artery. FroDa( 41 ) From the ganglion, on each side, branches are sent across, which communicate intimately toge- ther, and form round the root of the coeliac artery, a very intimate plexus, containing several ganglia of various sizes, formerly called the Solau, but now more correctly the Cceliac Plexus. Nerves pass from this plexus, with the branches of the aorta,- to the various viscera of the abdomen: in a common dissection these nerves cannot be clearly demonstrated, as they lie very close on the re- spective arteries, and are surrounded by much con- densed cellular substance; they form the hepatic, eplenic, superior, and inferior mesenteric, renal, and spermatic plexuses, 3. The trunk of the intercostal nerve, the poste- rior intercostal, perforates the small muscle of the diaphragm close to the spine, runs down on the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and along the upper edge of the psoas magnus. It terminates on the extremity of the os coccygis, by union with the nerve of the opposite side, in a ganglion named Ganglion Impar. In this course, it communi- cates with the lumbar nerves, and the various ab- dominal plexuses. The Thoracic Duct may be seen passing front the abdomen into the thorax, between the aorta and the right crus of the diaphragm. It is larger here than in its subsequent course, and the dilated portion is called receptaculum chyliy as the lacteal* pour in the chyle in this situation. CHAP.( 42 ) CHAP. 11. DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM, AND OF . THE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION *. ^J^HE muscles arid vessels to be demonstrated, lie deep amongst much loose cellular substance; and unless great caution is used, important parts will be removed, while the student supposes he is only clearing away cellular substance:—The rectum having been cleansed, a little baked hair may be in- troduced into its extremity, which will keep th« anus gently protruding during the dissection; or a cork, with a loop attached to it, may be intro- duced, and the mouth of tlie gut tied upon it;— this last method is preferable, as the intestine can then be turned in every direction :—The disi-cction will also be facilitated by introducing a staff into the bladder, in order to mark out the situation of the urethra; the subject should be placed in the same position as for the lateral operation of litho- tomy. * Tliis dissection will be more complt fc, if thr ptlvis :lm^ Jowfir exlrcmilies arc injrctfd ; fnr thus tlie iiiiportaitl branches of tlic pudic artery will be more easily traced. The( ) The muscles of the perineum consist of five pair, and a single muscle : Erector Penis, ^ Accelerator Uhium, / ^ ^^^j^ ^ Sphincter Transversus Perinei,V ^.j^ ^ Ani, single Levator Ani, i ' / muscle. COCCYGEUS, y Jn commencing this important dissection, recollect that the erector muscle, covering the crus of the pe- nis, arises from the tuber ischii, and ascends on the inside of the ramus of that bone;— that the transversua perinei arises from nearly the same point, and crosses the perineum,, lying often at a considerable depth in the adipose substance. The tuber ischii then becomes a proper place for the commencement of the dissec- tion ; carefully tracing the muscles arising from that point, remove all the cellular substance, situated in the perineum, while the muscular fibres are left un- touched ; the Raphe or line running along the skin of the perineum, marks the place where the opposite muscles meet. The appearance of these muscles will vary in different subjects. In those who have died weak and emaciated, the fibres will be pale, and not very evident, while in strong muscular men, who have expired suddenly, they will be very distinct. This dissection is to be continued till all the parts be- tween the tuberosities of the ischia on each side, and between the tubis before, and the tip of the os coc- cygis behind, are fairly brought into view. Observe, The Erector Penis covering the crus of the penis. The Accelerator Urin^e embracing the bulb and( 44. ) and lower part of the Corpus Spokgiosum of the Urethra. The Sphincter Ani, encircling the anus. The Transversus Perinei, crossing the peri- neum transversely. 1. The Erector Pekis—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the tuberosity of the os ischium ; its flesh}' fibres proceed upwards over the crus of the penis, adhering to the outer and inner edges of the ascending ramus of the os ischium, and of the de- scending ramus of the os pubis ;—but before the two crura meet to form the body of the penis, it ends in a flat tendon, which is lost in the strong tendinous membrane that covers the corpus cavernosum. Situation : This muscle covers all the surface of the crus penis that is not in contact with bone; it arises on each side of the attachment of the crus to the bone. Use : It was formerly supposed to compress the crus' penis, and thereby to propel the blood into the fore-part of the corpus cavernosum ; and to press the- penis upwards against the pubis. But its obvious effect must be that of drawing the crus downwards to the tuber ischii; which cannot have any influ- ence in contributing to the erect state of the organ. Synonyma: Ischio-cavernosus;—Ischio-caverneux. 2. The Accelerator Urin«—Arises, by a thin tendinous expansion, from the descending ramus of the pubis, and from the ascending ramus of the is- chium, nearly as far down as the tuber;—this origin lies under the crus of the penis, and the flcsliy fibres are seen coming out from the angle between the crus and( 45 ) and the corpus spongiosum urethrac; they proceed obliquely downwards and backwards, embrace the bulb and lower part of the corpus spongiosum, and are Inserted into a white tendinous line in the middle of the bulb of the urethra, joining there with the muscle of the opposite side. The lowermost fibres run nearly transversely, while the superior fibres are very oblique. Use : To drive the urine and semen forwards, by compressing the lower part of the urethra, and to propel the blood towards the corpus spongiosum and the glans penis. Synonyma : Ejaculator seminis;—Bulbo-caverno- sus;—Bulbo-syndesmo-caverneux. 3. The Transversus Perinei—Arises from the tough fatty membrane that covers the tuber ischii, immediately behind the attachment o£ the erector penis; thence its fibres run transversely inwards. Inserted into the central point of union where the sphincter ani touches the accelerator urinae, and where a kind of tendinous projection is formed, common to the five muscles. Use: To dilate the bulb of the urethra, to prevent the anus from being too much protruded, and to re- tract it when protruded. Synonyma : Transversali& penis ;—Transversalis utethrae;—Levator parvus, seu externus;—Ischio- pubi-prostatique. There is sometimes another slip of fibres, the Transversojs Perinei Alteh, which has the same couriey( 40 ) course, and is Inserted into the posterior part of the bulb of the urethra. 4. The Shhincter Ani consists of two semicir- cular planes, which run round the extremity of the rectum, passing nearly as far out as the tuber ischii; the fibres of each side decussate v/here they meet, and are Inserted into the extremity of the os coccygis be- hind * ; and before, into a tendinous point comrdon to this muscle, and to the acceleratores urinas and transversi perinei. This tendinous pomt, is worthy of remark; it seems to consist in part of an elastic ligamentous substance. Use-i To close the anus, or extremity of the rec- tum, and to pull down the bulb of the urethra. It is in a state of constant contraction, independently of the will, in order to prevent the contents of the rec- tum from escaping except at those times when we make an effort to evacuate them. Synonyma: Sphincter externus ;—Sphincter cuta- neus;—Coccygi-cutane-sphincter. More deeply seated than the muscles now de- scribed, we see some of the fibres of The Levator Ani.—This muscle arises from the inside of the os pubis, at the upper edge of the fora- men thyroideum, from the inside ot the os ischium, from the tendinous membrane covering the obtu- ♦ The spliincter ani often arises bj an elastic tendon ap- proaching to llie nature of a ligament, from the apex of the OS coccygis. This tniidon is of some length ; it gives off mus- cular fibres, which lurround tJie extremity of tlic rccliwn. rator( *7 ) trator interims and coccygeus muscles ;—from the •semicircular origin its fibres run down like radii : towards a center, and are Inserted in the two last bones of the os coccygis, : and into the extremity of the rectum, passing with- ; in the fibres of the sphincter ani, but on the outside I of the longitudinal fibres of the gut itself. Situation: This muscle, with its fellow, very 1 much resembles a funnel, surrounding the extremity I of the rectum, the neck of the bladder, (which I passes through a slit in his fibres,) the prostate gland, and part of the vesiculse seminales. Use: To draw the rectum upwards after the eva- cuation of the faeces, to assist in shutting it, and to compress the vesiculae seminales and other viscera of the pelvis. Synonyma : Musculus ani latus ;—Levator mag- nus. seu internus ;—Pubio-coccigi-annulaire. 6. The Coccygeus arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the spinous process of the os ischium, and covers the inside of the posterior sacro-sciatic liga- ment ; it forms a thin fleshy belly, • Inserted into the extremity of the os sacrum, and into the lateral surface of the coccygis, immedi- ately before the gluteus maximus. Situation: It is placed betwixt the levator ani, and edge of the gluteus maximus. Use : To support and move the os coccygis for- wards, and connect it more firmly with the sacrum. Sijnon. Ischio-coccigien. Theacceleratoresurinajand transversi perlnei must iVow be removed from their insertions. They may be left 1{ 48 ) left suspended by their attachments to the bone. The rectum must be separated from the bladder, and pulled downwards. This dissection will expose a great part of the levator ani; —the neck and body of the bladder ;—the prostate gland ;—the veeiculae se- minales ;—the glandulae anteprostatae ;—part of the vasa deferentia:—part of the ureters ;—the urethra, its membranous part, its bulb, and corpus spongi- osum ;—the crura penis, and their origin from the ischium;—Observe, 1. The connection of the bladder and rectum, and the cellular substance interposed between them. 2. The prostate gland: Situated between the blad- der and rectum, surrounding the beginning of the urethra in such a manner, that one third of its thick- ness ia situated above the urethra, and two thirds below it; its shape is somewhat pyriform, and its consistence between cartilage and ligament. 3. The Urethra..—The curve should be care- fully observed. The urethra begins at the neck of the bladder; it is a continuation of that part of the bladder which in . the erect posture is lowest. (1.) Its beginning is embedded in the prostate gland. (2.) Its membranous part is very short,—situated be- tween the prostate gland and bulb of the urethra:— in dissecting, remark, that there is a firm fasciculus of jRbres surrounding it, and connecting it and the pro- state gland to the arch of the pubis this fosciculu^ gives support to the urethra, and is termed the liga- rnentura triangulare urethrce. It is sometimes de- scribed as a compressor muscle of the prostate gland. (3.) The urethra then enters the corpus spongiosum. 4.1 he( 49 ) 4. The Corpus Spongiosum UiiETHn/E consists of a plexus of minute veins covered externally by a thin but uniform tendinous sheet; it surrounds the urethra from a short distance from the bladder to its extremity: at its beginning, it forms a consi- derable body of a pyriform shape, termed the Bulb of the Urethra ; that part of the bulb which is below the urethra, is named the pendulous part of the bulb. The corpus spongiosum is expanded at its anterior extremity, to form the glans penis. 5. The Gland uL-^ Anteprostat^, or Cowper's Glands, are two small glands of the size of peas, situated immediately before the prostate, and between the membranous part and bulb of the urethra. 6. The VEsicuLiE Seminales are two soft, whitish, knotted bodies, about three or four fingers- breadth in length, and one in breadth, and about three times as broad as thick ; Situated hei-ween the rectum and lower part of the bladder obliquely, so that their inferior extremities are contiguous, and are affixed to the base of the prostate gland, while their superior extremities are at a distanoe from each other, extending outwards and upwards, and termi- nating just on the inside of the insertion of the ure- ters in the bladder. 7. The two V'asa Deferentia are seen nmning betwixt the vesiculae seminales, and united to them and to the base of the prostate. Observe that part ef the bladder, left between these tubes, and con- nected by cellular substance to the rectum, which is pierced when the bladder is punctured from the latter part. ;C 8. The( 50 ) 8. The Corpora Cavernosa Penis arise, on each side, by a process named the Crus, from the ramus and from the tuber ischii, ascend along the ischium and pubis, and are united immediately before the cartilaginous arch of the pubis;—they are covered by a strong, white, shining, fibrous, ligamento-ten- dinous substance, which is very elastic. Internally they are cavernous, and are separated from each other by a septum, which, from being perforated, is named Septum pectiniforme. By the union of the two corpora cavernosa, two grooves are formed:—(1.) A smaller one above, in which two arteries pass, a large vein or two betwixt them, and some large twigs of nerves. (2.) A larger groove below, which receives the urethra. 9. The Vesica Urinaria, or Urinary Blad- der, is situated within the pelvis, immediately behind the ossa pubis, and before the rectum. It is covered on its upper and back part by a reflection of peritoneum; in front and below (where it is con- tiguous to the rectum), it is connected by cellular membrane to the surrounding parts. Shape, oval, but flattened before and behind, and, while in the pelvis, somewhat triangular. Divided into the fundus or bottom, corpus or bodv, and cervix or neck. In the contracted state, the fundus is the broadest and roundest part, but, when distended, the cervix is broader than any other part. At the top of the blad- der, above the symphysis pubis, may be observed, the superior ligament of the bladder, consisting of the UrachiiSy a ligamentous cord, which runs up between the peritoneum and linea alba, as far as the nave!, I( 51 ) savel*, and two of the ligamentous cords, which are the remains of the umbilical arteries, and run up from the sides of the bladder.—The ligamentum in- ferius vesicae connects the bladder to the upper and inner side of the ossa pubis. Observe the parts of the bladder not covered by peritoneum ; as they are the situations of surgical operations. These are the whole anterior surface^ lying against the pubis, and rising above it, when the bladder is distended, so that it may be punctured above the pubis ;—the &ides, as the very lowest 1 jaj-1^ of which the cut is made in the lateral operation of;' lithotomy, and where the viscus may be puncmKe^^ from the perineum ;—and the inferior surface, rest* j-j. . i CRARY ing on the rectum, and allowing us to puncture fromi' it. Observe also the direction of the axis of the bladder, in conformitj' with which all instruments should be introduced: this is in a line drawn from the navel to the 03 coccygis. 10. The entrance of the ureters into the bladder on the outside of the vesiculae seminales. 11. The rectum, following the curve of the os sacrum, and os coccygis. 12. The prepuce is a fold of skin forming a sheath or covering for the glans penis. It makes a duplica- ture extending along the flat part of the glans from its basis to the orifice of the urethra, termed Fr^num Pr^putii. To have a more connected view of the relative situation of these important parts, one side of the • III the fcefus, it is a prolongation or production of llie toats of the bladder. c 2 pelvis( 52 ) pelvis should now be removed, by dividing the sym- physis pubis, and by sawing through the os ileunj, or separating it at its junction with the sacrum. By cardully removing all the cellular membrane, the student will be enabled more accurately to examine the situation of the parts above described. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES CON- TAINED WITHIN THE PELVIS. 1. ARTERIES. TiiF, A. Iliaca Interna, having left tlie trunk of the iliaca communis, passes immediately into the pelvis, where it gives off several large arteries. 1. A. Ileo-Lumbalis supplies the psoas and iliacus internus muscles. 2. A. Sacr^t; Laterales, two or three small vessels which silpply the sacrum, cauda equina, and neighbouring parts. 3. A. Glutea, (or iliaca posterior) a very large branch, passes out of the pelvis through the upper part of the sciatic notch to supply the haunch, but, in its passage, it gives some branches to the os sacrum, OS coccygis, the rectum, and the muscles situated within the pelvis. 4. A. Sciatica passes out of the pelvis by the sciatic notch, and below the pyriformis muscle to supply the hip : in its passage it gives branches to the neighbouring parts. 5. A. PuprcA (pudenda communis or interna J it the( 53 ) the brunch of the internal iliac, which is more im- mediately destined to supply tue parts of generation, perineum, and lower part of the rectum : it goes out of the pelvis above the superior socro-sciatic ligament, twists round it, and re-enters the pelvis above and before the inferior sacro-sciatic ligament: it then descends on the inside of the tuber ischii, ascends on the inner surface of the rami of the ischium and pubis ; and, reaching the root of the penis, divides into two branches. (1.) A. Perinei, a branch, which, after giving twigs to the bulb of the urethra and neighbouring muscles, enters the crus of the penis, and subdivides into branches which pass to botli extremities of the crus. (2.) A. DonsALis Penis, passes under the arch of the pubis, runs along the dorsum penis, and is distributed to the integuments. In its course the pudie artery gives off many branches. (1.) While in the pelvis, it gives twigs to th^' bladder, prostate and rectum. (2.) A. HjEmorriioidales Externa come from the pudic. while passing by the anus. (3.) A. Transversa Perinet, following- the course of the transversus perinei muscle. t 6. A. Obturatrix descends on the inside of the psoas muscle, passes through the foramen in the ob- turator ligament to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. 7. A. Hypogastrica, which in the foetus send* off the umbilical artery, is in the adult continued only c 3I ( 54 ) to the side of the bladder, to which it gives branches; in the female, it enters the neck of the uterus, and gives branches to the vagina. You must not expect to meet with uniformity in the distribution of these vessels in all subjects, some- times the gluteal and pudic arteries come off by onft trunk, sometimes the pudic and sciatic, &c. &c. 2. VEINS. The veins attend the arteries and their ramifica- tions ; they unite to form the internal iliac vein, ex- cept the veins from llie rectum, named Hosmorrhoi' dales, which ascend along its back part to join tli« inferior mesenteric vein. S. NERVES. The ner/es met with in this dissection consist of numerous twigs sent off from the lumbar and sacral nerves to supply the parts about the pelvis. But, in this dissection, we meet with three pair of large nerves, which have their course through the pelvis, and pass to the thigh. 1. Course of the Anterior CnunAL Nerve while in the pelvis. The anterior crural nerve is formed by branches of the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves; at its origin, it lies under the psoas magnus, and, as it descends, passes betwixt the psoas magnus and iliacus internus, till, having passed under Poupart's ligament, it emerges from betwixt those muscles, and appears on the outer side of the inguinal artery. 2. Course( 55 ) 2. Course of the Obturator Nerve within the pelvis. '1 his nerve is formed by branches of the se- cond, third, and fourth lumbar nerves : it lies under the internal border of the pioas magnus, descends into the pelvis, and goes obliquely downwards, to accompany the obturator artery through the thyroid hole. 3. Course of the Great Sciatic Nerve within tlie pelvis. This nerve arises by branches from the fourth and fifth lumbar, and three first sacral nerves, which unite together to form the largest nervous trunk in the body. The nerve passes betwixt the pyriformis and gcmini, and thus escapes from the back-part of the pelvis by the sciatic notch. Some- times one of the branches goes through the pyrifor- mis, and joins the sciatic trunk at the back of the pelvis. OF THE SCROTUM. The scrotum consists externally of a loose, rugose ekin, and internally of condensed cellular membrane, which have been described as a muscle, under the name of Dartos. On dividing the anterior part of the scrotum, on' either side of the raphe, we expose, 1. The Testicle, a gland of an oval flattened form, covered by the tunica vaginalis, having on its upper edge an appendage termed Epididymis. 2. The Spermatic Chord, connecting the. testicle to the abdominal ring. It consists of, a, The spermatic artery, a branch of the aorta; c 4' this( 56 ) this divides into several branches, which enter the upper edge of the testicle. b, The spermatic veins, which foi-m a plexus, tliat terminates in the abdomen, in a single vein. c, The spermatic nerves, which come from the hitercostal and lumbar nerves. d, The vas deferens, or excretory duct of the tes- ticle ;—this is situated in the back-part of the chord, and is distinguished by its firm cartilaginous feel. e, The spermatic absorbents. ^ These parts are all connected by cellular mem- ba-ane, and by the tunica vaginalis, which is covered by a thin muscle. g, The cremaster;—this arises from the obliquus deseendens internus, and is lost on the tunica vagi- nalis. CHAP. III. DISSECTION. OF THE ORGANS OF GENE- RATION IN THE FEMALE. "PREVIOUS to the dissection, it will be proper t© examine the external parts. The MoNs Veneris is a rounded prominence, covered with hairs after puberty, situated at the lower part of the belJy, and arising oa each side gradually , , from( 57 ) from the groins; it consists of the commo» integu- ments, with an aiklitional quantity of celluhir and adipose substance,.and lies upon the fore-part of the ofisa pubis. From the inferior part of the mons veneris arise The Labi a Externa, called also the labia or alse pudendi: they are continued downwards and forwards in the direction of the symphysis pubis, and terminate in the perineum anterius : they consist of integuments, cellular substance, and fat,—are thicker above than below,—and are red and vascular on their inner side. The places where the labia are joined to each other above and below, are termed Commis- sures. The longitudinal cavity or fissure, situated betwixt the labia, and extending from the mons veneris to the perineum anterius, is sometimes called the Sinus PuDORis; it is broader above than below, and con- tains several other parts. On separating the labia, we see, immediately below the superior ccmmissure, The CiiTOKis, a red projecting body, situated be- low the arch of the pubis, and partly covered by its Prepuce : The prepuce is a fold of skin, continued from the inner surface of the labia, so as to cover the superior and lateral part of the clitoris.—The clitoris resembles the penis of the male, and consists of two cavernous bodies ; these, however, cannot be traced in this stage of the dissection. That part of the body which forms an obtuse projection external!/, is called the Gl.-vns. The Perineum Anterius is that portion of the c 5 soft( 58 ) soft parts wTilcli extend from the inferior commisr sure of the labia to the anus. The Perineum Posterius 5s the space betwixt the anus and point of the os coccygis. The Nymphs are two prominent doublings of the integuments, extending from the glans of the clitoris to the sides of the vagina. Their external &ide is continued from the inner surface of the labia, and from the prepuce of the clitoris, while their internal surface seems immediately continued from the fine, thin, vascular, integuments covering the clitoris it- self; they are spongy, and consist internally of cel- lular and adipose substance. A little lower, we see the orifice of the urethra; it is situated below the clitoris and arch of the pubis, betwixt the nymphae, and above the orifice of the vagina; it consists of a small rising prominence like a pea, in the centre of which is a small opening or hole. On each side of the orifice of the urethra, we meet generally with the orifices of two mucdus glands, which by some are named Cowper's Glands of the female. On separating tire lower part of the labia ptidendi, we see the Vestibulum, a space which leads to the vagina; it is bounded behind, by the carunculae myr- tiformes> or by the hymen in virgins; on the sides, hy the labia; before, by the perineum antcrius, which projects forwards, forming a kind of valve, so> that a little pit is formed behind it, wliich is termed Fossa Naviculatis, or Scaphoides. Tlve Hymex, or Circulus Mcmbranosus, is a thin snd extensile membrane,, formed by a doubling of( S9 ) e 6 by the inner surface of the vestibulum and lower part of the vagina, the entrance of which is by its means much contracted in virgins. It generally l)as aa opening in its upper part, but it is completely rup- . tured in the first coitus: its form is various, fre- quently seniilunar,, and then its base is ^ittached to t'le vestibulum, while its cornua extend upwards as far as the sides of tlia urethra. After the destruction of the hymen, in married women, we see some irregular projections marking the orifice of the vagina, and termed Caruncul;e MvRTirouMES : they are generally supposed to be the remains of the hymen, but are not exactly in the same situation. Behind these is the Vagina, or canal leading to the uterus; at the extremity of which may be felt projecting the Os Internum Uteri, or Os Tincje, but it cannot be seen without dissection. The skin should be now divided on the side of the right labium, and the dissection should be carried from the groin to the side of the anus; the cellular membrane must be carefully removed, in order to expose the following parts. We find the Clitoris consisting of two spongy bodies, termed Crura, which unite and form the body. The crus of each side is a cavernous body, arising from the ramus and upper part of the tube- rosity of the ischium, continued along the ramus of the OS pubis, and uniting with its fellow opposite to the symphysis pubis. The body formed by the crura does not extend upwards, but forms a curve down- wards towards the urethra; it is divided internallyf 60 r by the Sectum Pectiniforme, and is attached to- the symphysis pubis by a suspensory ligament; it is invested by a ligamentous membrane. The muscles which are met with in this dissection consist of four pair, and two single muscles. The Erector Clitoridis, TrANSVERSUS PEHINEr,. f , -J > on each side. Levator Ani, t CoccyGEUS, J The Sphincter Ant, t . , , _ tr J- two smgle muscles. Sphincter VAGixiE,j 1. The Erector Clitorides, arises^ fleshy and tendinous, from the tuber ischii, from the inside of the ramus of the os ischium, and from the ramus of the OS pubis : It passes over the crus of the clitoris, and, becoming tendinous, is lost upon it. Use : To> draw the clitoris downwards and for- wards, and,, by compressing it, to propel the blood.- Synonyma : First muscle of the clitoris ;—Ischio. cavernosus ;—Ischio-clitoridien. Arising from the same point, and surrounded by much celhilar membrane, we find, 2. The Transversus Perinei.—Its oriiri/i is the same as in the male. It is inserted into a ligamentous substance in tht perineum anteiiufi, at the point where the sphincter ani and sphincter vaginae meet. This ligamentous or tendinous substance deserves attention. Here, as in the male, it is tlic point of. union into which muscles are inserted. Use: To sustain the perineum* 3. Surrounding the extremity of the vagina, and a. ftnall. 1( 61 ) wwali part of the vestibulura, we find the Sphincter Vagin/E; it ariscsy anteriorly, from the crura of the clitoris on each side; it surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is Inserted into the ligaraentous point of the peri- neum, where the fibres of each side meet^ and are connected with those of the transversi perinei, and witli the sphincter ani. Use: To contract the mouth of the vagina, and compress the plexos retiformis. Synonyma : Constrictor cunni;—Second muscle «f the clitoris ;—Anulo-syndesrao-clitoridien. 4. The Sphinct£K Ani exactly resembles the same muscle in the male. 5. The Levator Ani resembles the same muscle of the male; it suKrounds the sides of the vagina in part, and consequently assists in constricting and supporting it, 6. The Cocc^GEUS is longer than in the male, from the greater transverse Uiiuneter of the ipferior aperture of the pelvis. Under the fibres of the sphincter vaginae, you will find the PiiEXUs Retiformis, or Cokpus Caver- NOSU.M Vagina, a spongy body,, consisting of cellur lar substance, interwoven with a number of convo- luted blood-vessels ; it arises from the sides of the clitoris, passes on each side of the extremity of the vagina, is not continued completely around it, but is lost on its posterior part. The Vagina is the canal leading from the vesti- bulum to the uterus. It lies betwixt the rectum and i-uferior surface of the urethra and bladder, and is- connected( 62 ) connected to them by cellular membrane. It is composed of fibrous substance, partly ligamentous, and perhaps in part muscular; its inner surface is rugose, vascular, and occupied by mucous glands. On slitting it up, M^e see, at its posterior extremity, the Os Uteri, a rounded projection, with a transverse fissure. The Uterus, or Womb.—This organ is best seen from the cavity of the abdomen. It is situated be- twixt the bladder and rectum, to both of which it is connected by reflections of peritoneum ; it is of the shape of a pear, somewhat flattened, inwardly hol- low, outwardly out of a whitish colour, and of a firm consistence. The broad upper part of the womb is called the Fundus Uteri, the narrower part is named the neck, or Cervix Uteri, and the intermediate part its Body. The uterus has four ligaments, two on each side : 1. Tlie LiGAMENTUM Teres, or Hound Liga- ment. It is a round long cord, extending from the $ide of the fundus uteri, and passing through the ab- dominal ring, to be lost in the groin. The LiGAMENTUM Latum, or Broad Ligament, is a broad fold of peritoneum, reflected from the body of the uterus, and connecting it on tlie sides of the pelvis. The uterus, together with its two broad ligaments, divides the pelvis into an anterior and posterior half; in the former of which is the bladder, and in the latter the rectum. The dupli- cature of the broad ligament encloses the Fallopian lube, ovary, and round ligament. The Falloi'ian Tubes are two. Each tube is contamed( 63 ) contained in the upper part of the doubh'ng of the broad ligament; it goes out from the fundus of the womb, and is a slender hollow tube : its outer end is curved downwards and backwards, and terminates by a broad fringed extremity, termed Morsus Di- ABOLi, or the Fimbiii.-e.—This broad extremity is connected to the next pair of organs. The Ova III A are two small oval bodies, white and flat, situated by the sides of the uterus, and inclosed in the posterior fold of the broad ligament behind the Fallopian tube; each ovarium is connected to the fundus uteri by a short round ligament. The Bladder is situated before the uterus, and is described in the preceding chapter. The Uketiira is short in females, and near the bladder is surrounded by a spongy fleshy sub- stance,—is connected to the cartilaginous arch of the pubis by the ligamentum inferius vesicae. The Ureter descends from the kidneys over the psoas muscle; it runs for some space betwixt the bladder and vagina, and at last perforates the bladder near the neck. The Rectum lies behind the uterus.—See the preceding chapter. To obtain a more satisfactory knowledge of the relative situation of the parts, the left side of the pelvis should be removed as in the male, and the parts exiynined in that situation. CHAP.f C 6-i ) CHAP. IV. DISSECTION OF THE THl-GH. SECT. I. OF THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE TIWGH. ^ 1. OF THE FASCIA, CUTANEOUS VESSELS, AND NERVES. > JgENEATH tTie integuments common to every part of the body, jou will find a strong fascia, or aponeurotic expansion, investing the whole thigh. This expansion is named the Fascia Lata Fe- MORis; it consists partly of tendinous, pavtly of li- gamentous fibres; it surrounds and covers all the muscles, and sends septa or partitions betvveea them :—It is very strong, smooth, and tendinous on the outer part of the thigh ; but, on the antt i :or and, inner part, it is very thin, and of a cellular texture. Therefore if you wish to demonstrate the whole ex- tent of this fascia, it should be first exposed on the outskle of the thigh, and the dissection should be continued very carefully inwards on the fore-part, where it is with difficulty distinguished from the common cellular membrane Butj in removing the common integuments from thellie fore-part of the thigli, it will be proper to attend to some parts which are situated above the fascia. 1. 'J he Vena Saphena Major is seen running up in tlie inside of the knee and thigh. At first it lies ver}' superticial, betwixt the skin and fascia, and in- vohed in the intermediate cellular membrane. As it ascends, it is gradually enveloped by the fibres of the fascia, and then sinks beneath it to join the femoral vein about an inch below Poupart's ligament:—In its course it is joined by several cutaneous veins. 2. Immediately under the true skin, and more su- perficial than the veins or nerves, you may occasion- ally perceive the Lymphatic Vessels running, like lines of a whitish colour, to enter the inguinal glands: they are more numerous on the fore-part, than on the outside of the thigh. 3. Several Cutaneous Nerves are seen ramify- ing above the fascia. They all come from the lumbar or anterior crural nerve, pierce the fascia about the lower part of the abdomen and groin, and are distri- buted to the groin, and integuments on the fore- part of the thigh. The fascia may now be exposed distinctl-y. Ob- serve how extensively it arises from tlie bones, ten- dons, and ligaments. On the anterior and superior part of the thigh, it arises from Poupart's ligament *„ from * At this part the fascia of the tliigh Is covered by a mure superficial expanjioii^ wliich lies over the lower part of the apcniLurosis of the exieraai obliq^ue muscle, completely covers, ibc crural arcl), and descends some little way beyond the bend ufthelhlgb. It has ceen called the supcijiciaijkscia. It co- ver*.f 66 ) from the os pubis, from the descending ramus of that bone, and from the ascending ramus and tuberosity of the ischium behind, and on the outside, from the whole spine of the ileum, and from the sacro-sciatic ligaments. It receives a number of fibres from a muscle belonging to it, viz, the tensor vaginae femo- tis, and from the tendon of the gluteus-muximus;— it passes down over the whole thigh, is firmly fixed to the linea aspera, to the condyles of the femur, and to the patella,—and is continued over the knee, to be attached to the heads of the tibia and fibula, after which it forms the fascia of the leg. On the upper and anterior part of the thigh, there is a slight hollow, where the great vessels descend under the crural arch. The fascia lata forms just on. the outside and upper part of this, a crescent-shaped fold, called its semilnmir edge, which is stronglj' con- nected to the crural arch, and sometimes contri- butes to the strangulation in femoral hernia. The fasci^ should now be dissected back ; and in lifting up the thicker part of it, which covers the outside of the thigh, you may observe that it is com- posed of two laminae of fibres : The fibres of the outer lamina run in circles round the thigh, while those on the inside, which are stronger, and more firmly connected, run longitudinally. Tcrs the abforbent gliiiids, &c. at the groin, and often consists «f several hijers separated by thre^- gland" and adipose sub- stance. It h is Tiither the appearance of condensed cellular menvbraoc, than of a trndiauus faiicia. § 2. MUSCLES( 67 ) §2. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE-PART AND INSIDE OF THE THIGH, TiiFSE are nine in number. 1, The Tensok Vaginje Femoris—Arises, by a narrow, tendinous, and fleshy origin, from the exter- nal part of the anterior superior spinous process of the OS ileum : it forms a considerable fleshy belly. Inse^-ted into the inner side of the great fascia, where it covers the outside of the thigh, and a little below the trochanter major. Situation : Its origin lies between the origin of the sartorius, and the anterior fibres of the gluteus me- dius, betwixt which muscle it descends ; it does not lie external to the fascia of the thigh, but is inclosed in a duplicature of it; its insertion lies anterior to that part of this membrane which arises from the tendon of the gluteus maximus. Use : To stretch the great fascia of the thigh, to assist in the abduction of the thigh, and in its rota- tion inwards. Synonyma : Musculus fascias latae;—Fascialis;— Membranous;—Ilio-aponeuri-femoral. 2. The Sartorius—Jrwes, by short tendinous fibres, from the anterior superior spinous process of the OS ileum, soon becomes fleshy, extends obliquel j across the thigh, and passes behind the inner condyle. Inserted, by a broad and thin tendon, into the inner side of the tibia, immediately below its ante- rior tubercle. Situation: Its origin lies between that of the tensor vaginaj( 68 ) vaginre femoris, and the outer attachment of Pou- part's ligament, and above the anterior fibres of the iliacus internus. It lies before the muscles of the thigh, crossing thtm like a strap about two inches in breadth ; it runs down for some space upon the rectus femoris, passes over the vastus internus, and then over the triceps adductor longus. At the lower part of the thigh, it runs between the tendon of the triceps adductor magnus, and that of the gracilis.-— In all this course, it is firmly bound down by the common fascia of the thigh. It is inserted above tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, over which it sends an aponeurotic expansion. Use To bend the leg obliquely inwards on the thigh, and to bend the thigh forwards. Synonyma: Longissimus femoris;— Ilio-creti-tibiaK 3.The Rectus Femoris—Arises, by a strong ten- don, from the inferior anterior spinous process of the OS ileum ; and, by another strong tendon, from the dorsum of that bone a little above the acetabu- lum, and from the capsular ligament of the hip joint. The two tendons soon unite, and send off a large belly, which runs down over the anterior part of the thigh, forming a complcto penniform muscle, and terminates in a flat but strong tendon, which is Inserted into the upper extremity of the patella; where a thin aponeurosis is sent from it over the fore-part of that bone, to terminate on the strong li- gament which connects the lower part of the patella to the tibia, and is called Ligamentum Patella;. Situation : To expose the tendinous origins of thij muscle, the origins of the sartorius and tensor vaginae femorU( G9 ) ftimoris must be raised ; and then that tendon, which proceeds from the inferior spinous process, may be seen partly covered with the outer edge ofthe iliacus rnternu-s while the other tendon is exposed by raising the anterior and inferior fibres of the gluteus mini- mus. The fleshy belly, at its uppermost part is co- vered by the sartorious, and, to allow that muscle to slide over it, is tendinous ; below this, it is situated su- perficially, imraediatc4y under the fosoiae, runs down over the vasti and crurseus ; and on its posterior sur- face, where it is in contact-with those muscles, it is tendinous. Its insertion lies betwixt the two vasti. Use: To extend the leg on the thigh, and to bend the thigh on the pelvis; to bring the pelvis and thigh forwards to the leg. Synonyma : Rectus cruris;—Rectus anterior;-— Gracilis anterior;—Ilio-rotulien. Under the rectus, and partly covered by it, there Is a large mass of flesh, which, at first sight, appears to form but one muscle. It may, however, be divided into three; the separation on the external surface is not generally very evident, but, by following the course of the vessels which enter this mass, and by cutting through perhaps a few fibres externally, you will discover the line of separation ; and this separa- tion, as you proceed deeper with your dissection, will become very distinct. The three muscles are named vastus externus, vastus internus, and cruraeus : at the upper and middle parts of the thigh, they may be separated very distinctly; but for two or three inches above the condyles, they are connected inseparably. 4;. The Vastus Externus—Arises, tendinous and fleshy,( 70 ) fleshy, from tlie anterior surface of the roe»t of the trochanter major, from the outer edge of the linea aspera, its whole length, —from the oblique line run- ning to tlie external oond3'le,—and from the whole external flat surface of the thigh bone. The fleshy fibres run obliquely forwards. Inserted into the external surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris, and into the side of the patella:— Part of it ends likewise in an aponeurosis which passes over the side of the knee to the leg, and is firmly fixed to the head of the tibia, closely ad- liering to the capsule of the knee-joint. Situation: This muscle forms the large mass of flesh on the outside of the thigh ; it is in part con- cealed by the rectus: on its outer surface, it appears tendinous at its upper part, and fleshy lower down; on its internal surface, it is fleshy above, and tendi- nous below;—it laps over the outside of the cru- rasus, where it arises from the linea aspera; it is situated anterior to the tendinous insertion of the gluteus maximus, and to the origin of the short head of the biceps flexor cruris : Use: To extend the leg, or to bring the thigh forwards upon the leg. 5. The Vastus Internus—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the fore-part of the root of the trochan- ter minor, from all the upper edge of the linea aspera, from the oblique, line running to" the inner condyle^ and from the whole internal surface of the thigh bone. Its fibres descend obliquely downwards and forwards. Inserted into the lateral surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris, and into the side of the patella: it also sends{ 71 ) sends off aponeurosis, which is continued down t» the Icp- and covers the inner part of the capsule of the knee. SifKation : This muscle embraces the inside of the femur in the same manner as the last described muscle does the outside, but it is much smaller ;—it is also in part covered by the rectus. At its upper part the sartorious passes over it obliquely; it laps over the cruraeus, and is separated from it with greater diffi. culty than the vastus externus is. Where it arises from the root of the trochanter, it lies anterior to the common tendon of the iliacus internus and psoas mag- nus; and where it arises from the linea aspera and oblique line, it is situated anterior to, and in contact with the insertions of the pectlneus and triceps ad- ductor femoris. Like the vastus externus, its outer surface is tendinous above, while below its inner sur- face is tendinous, and the fleshy fibres pass obliquely from the one tendinous expansion to the other. Use : Same as the last. 6. The Crur^us, or Cruralis—Arises, fleshy, from between the two trochanters of the os femoris, from all the fore-part of the bone, and from the out- side as far back as the linea aspera ; but from the inside of the bone it does not arise, for between the fore-part of the femur and the inner edge of the linea aspera, there is a smooth plain surface, of the breadth of an inch, extending nearly the whole length of the bone, from which no muscular fibres arise. Inserted into the posterior surface of the tendon of the rectus, aud upper edge of the patella. iiiluation :( 72 ) Situation: Tlie principal part of this muscle is lapped over, and concealed, by the bellies of the two vasti; and the small part, which is seen projecting between the anterior edges of those muscles, lies behind the belly of the rectus Cruris. Use: Same as the last. Synonyma : These three muscles are described by Dumas as a triceps, which he names Tri-femoro rotulien. 7. The Gracilis arises, by a broad thin tendon, from the lower half of that part of the os pubis which forms the symphysis, and from the inner edge of the descending ramus:—It soons grows fleshy, and forms a belly, which, becoming narrower as it descends, terminates in a tendon, which passes behind the inner condyle of the thigh-bone, and is reflected forwards, to be Inserted in the inside of the tibia. Situation : It arises from the os pubis on the inside of the origins of the triceps adductor femoris, lying betwixt it and the cros penis; from the pubis to the knee it runs immediately under the inrcguments on the inside of the thigh; it is inserted below the ten- don of the sartorius, and above that of the semiten- dinosus. Use: To bring the thigh inwards and forward?, and to assist in bending the leg. Stjnonyma: Gracilis interior ;—Rectus interior;— Sous-pubi-creti-tibial, 8. Tlfe PectinAi.Ts. Arises, fleshy, from that ridge of the os pubis which lorms the brim of the pelv-is,pelvis, and from the concave siirfuce below tlie ridge; U forms a thick flat belly, In&srled, by a flat tendon into the linca aspera, immediately below the lesser trochanter. Siluation : Its origin lies on the inside of the belly of the psoas niagnus, where that muscle slides over the brim of the pelvis, and on the outside of the origin of the adductor longus :—It descends between the lower edge of the psoas, and the upper edge of the adductor longus; and it is inserted between these two muscles, and posterior to the origin of the vastus internus. Use: To bend the thigh forwards, to move it in- wards, and to perform rotation, by turning the toes outwards. Sijnonijma : Pectinaius—Pubio-femoral. 9. The Triceps Adductor Femoris consists of three distinct muscles, which, passing from the pelvis to the thigh, lie in diiferent layers upon one another, and have nearly the same action. (1.) The Adductor Longus. Arises, by a short strong tendon, from the upper and inner part of the OS pubis, near its symphysis;—forms a large trian- gular belly, which, as it descends, becomes broader, but less thicL Inserted, tendinous, into the middle part of the linca aspera, occupying rather moFe than one third of its length. Situation : It arises betwixt the pectinalis and gra- cilis, and above the adductor brevis:—The upper edge of its belly ranges with the lower edge of the pectiualis; and its insertion lies posterior to the origin D of( ) of the vastus internus, .and anterior to the insertion of the adductor magnus. Synonymn: Adductor primus;—Triceps primus;— long head of the triceps ;—Spino-pubio-femoral. ( 2.) The Adductor Brevis—Arises, fleshy and tendinous, from the os pubis, between the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and the foramen thyroideum: —it forms a fleshy belJ}'. Inserted, tendinous, into the upper third of the linea aspera. Situation : Its origin Hes under tlie origins of the pectinahs and adductor longus, and on the outside of the tendon of the gracilis :—Its belly descends behind the belly of the pectinalis, and behind the superior nbres of the adductor longus ; and its largest part is therefore concealed, but a small part appears between the lower edge of the pectinalis, and upper edge of the adductor longus;—It is inserted behind those muscles, but before the adductor magnus. Synonyma : Triceps secundus^—Adductor secun- «lus ;—Short head of the triceps ;—Sous-pubio- fem oral. ( 3. ) The Abductor Magnus—Arises, princi- pally fleshy, from the lower part of the body, and from the descending ramus of the os pubis, and from the ascending ramus of the ischium, as far as the tuberosity of that bone. The fibres run outwards and downwards, having various degrees of obliquity. Inserted, fleshy, into tlic whole length of the linca aspera, into the oblique ridge above the internal condyle of the os femoris, and, by a roundish long tendon, into the upper part of that condyle. Situation:( 75 ) Situation : Tliis large muscle arises behind and be- low the two other adductors; it forms a flat partition betwixt tlie muscles on the fore and back narts of the thigh ; its insertion lies behind the insertions of the long and short adductors, ^nd on the inside of tlie tendinous insertion of the gluteus maximus, and of the origin of the short head of the biceps flexor cruris : the superior fibres which cross the thigh transversely run along the lower edge of the quad- ratus femoris. Use : To approximate the thighs to each other ;— to roll them outwards. The two anterior lieads will bend the thigh; the posterior will extend it, if it be bent forwards. Synonijma: Adductor tertius et Adductor quartus; —Triceps tertius; Great head of the triceps ;— Ischio-pubio-femoral. § 3. AHTERIES, VEINS, AND NERVES ON.THE FORE-PART AND INSIDE OF THE THIGH. 1. ARTERIES. The Femoral Artery may be said to pass along the inside of the thigh, where it emerges from under Poupart's ligament; it lies cusliioned on the fibres of the psoas magnus, is called the inguinal artery, and is very nearly in the mid space between the angle of the pubis, and the anterior superior spine of the ileum, nearer how^ever by a finger s breadth to the former; having left the groin, it assumes the name of Femoral, and in its course down the thigh, runs over the following muscles:—The pectinalis, part of D 2 the( 76 ) the adductor brevis, where tliat muscle project? be- twixt the pectinalis and adductor longus; the whole of the adductor loiigus, and about an inch of the adductor magnus: It then slips betwixt the tendon of the adductor map-nus and the bone, and. enterin": the ham, becomes the Popliteal artery. To find the arteiy in any part of its course from the crural arch to the tendinous opening, turn out the foot, ascertain the place of that vessel at the crural arch according to the above description, and then draw a straight line downwards.—In this course, it has the belly of the vastus internus situated on its outside; it lies between the origin of that muscle, and the tendinous insertion of the muscles over which it crosses; and there is a strong interlacing of the tendinous fibres, forming a deep groove for the artery ; it is also invested by a firm sheath, which consists of condensed cellular mem- brane, intermixed with some tendinous fibres:—For some inches below Poupart's ligament, this artery is on its fore-part only covered by cellular substance, absorbent glands, and the general fascia of the thigh; but, meeting with the inclined line of the sartorius, it is, during the rest of its course, covered by that muscle. It perforates the teudon of the adductor magnus, at the distance of rather more than one-third of the length of the bone from its lower extremity. Observe that in popliteal aneurism the artery may be taken up either at the upper or iimer, the lowet or outer, margin of the Sartorius, or immediately behind that muscle : of v.-hich situations the first is the best, the second next best, and the third by far the least eligible, . BRANCHES( 77 ) BRANCHES OF THK FEMOllAL AllTER^*. The A. P/;oi'UMDA comes ofFfrom the femoral ar- tery at the distance of three or four inches from Pou- part's ligament ; it is nearly as large as the femoral itself, runs down for some little way behind it, and terminates in three or four branches, which, per- forating the triceps adductor, are named Arteki.'K pERi'OUANTES. Thcso, ramifying in every direction, supply all the great mass of muscles situated on the back-part of the thigh, and inosculate largely with the sciatic, gluteal, and obturator arteries. The pro- funda also sends ofF two considerable branches, which, encircling the upper part of the thigh, are named Circumflexa Interna, and Circum_ jLEXA Externa. • ' The profunda is the only branch of the femoral artery which is constant in its size and situation ; for though, during the Avhole of its course, the femoral gives olf branches to the muscles, yet these muscular arteries vary much, sometimes coming olf from the great artery, sometimes from the profunda, some- times coming off as a large single trunk which sub- divides, while at other times there are three or four distinct arteries. The branches of the femoral artery may be enu- merated as follows:—!, tiome t\vi<TS to the ineuinal glands, and some to the external parts of generation, * The Epigastrica and Circumflexa ilii .ire before described as branches ol ihe inguinal artery. D 3 named( 78 ) imiTied Piidiccc Externae. 2. Muscularis interna. 3. Muscularis externa. 4. Profunda. The Obtuuatok ARXEnv, arteria obturatrix, ■which is a branch of the internal iliac artery, passes through the notch at the upper part of the foramen thyroideum, and ramifies on the deep-seated muscles at the upper and inner part of the thigh. 2. VEINS. The Femoral Vein adheres closely to the femo- ral artery in its passage out of the abdomen, and ac- companies it in its course down the thigh, where it passes under Poupart's ligament; it lies on the inside of the artery, but, as it descends, it turns more and more posteriorly, so thac where they perforate the tendon of the adductor magnus, the vein is situated fairly behind the artery. Its branches correspond to those of the femoral artery; but about an inch below Poupart's ligament, it receives the vena saphena major, to which there is no corresponding artery. . The Obturator Vein accompanies the obtura- tor artery, and has the same distribution. 3. NERVES. Nervus Crukalis Anterior, or tlie Anterior Crural nerve, where it passes from under Poupart's ligament, lies about half an inch on the outside of the femoral artery; it immediatel}'- divides into a number of branches, which supply the muscles and integuments( 79 ) integuments on tlie fore-part and outside of the tlii"-h : A considerable branch, however, accompanies tlie femoral artery, crosses that vessel where it is about to perforate the adductor magnus, runs behind tho sartorius, and appears as a cutaneous nerve on tlie inside of the knee; proceeding downwards on the inside of the leg, it is largely distributed over the tibia, is intricated with the vena saphena major, and terminates on the inner ankle, and upper part of the foot. This branch is named Neuvus Sa- rilENUS, CUTANliUS LoNGUS, Another branch, which is distributed to the vastus internus, generally runs for some way in company with the femoral vessel. Nkrvus Obturator, or the obturator nerve, is found accompanying the obturator artery and vein; it nas the same distribution, and some branches ex- tend as far as the internal condyle of the thigh-bone, and communicate with the nervus saphenus. SECT. II. OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE THIGH. - § 1. OF THE FASCIA. Above that part of the great fascia which invests the thigh behind, we meet with several cutaneous nerves; these are of little importance ;—they have their origin either from the lumbar nerves, and come D -i over( 80 ) ever the spino of the os ilium, or from the great sciatic nerve, and emerge under the lower margin of the gluteus maximus. Other twigs come from the sacral nerve?, and from the sciatic in its course down the thigh, § 2. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE BACK-PART OF THE THJCH. These are eleven. On removing the integuments and fascia from the hjp, we denude, 1. The Gluieus Maximus.—It arises, fleshj-, ^om the posterior third of the spine of the cs ileum, from the whole lateral surface of the sacrum, below the posterior spinous process of the ileum ; from the back-part of the posterior or inferior sacro-sciatic ligament *, over which the edge of this muscle hangs in a folded manner, and from the lateral surface of the OS CQCcygis. Tiie fleshy fibres proceed obliquely forwards and downwards, forming a thick broad coarse muscle, and converging gradual!}', terminate in a strong flat tendon. This tendon slides over the posterior part of * The sacro-sciatic ligaments are two in number, they pass between the ischium and sacrum. 1. The external or inferior, or posterior, sacro-sciatic liga- menf, arises from the extcrual edge of the tranvcrse processes of the sacrum, descends obliquely, and is inserted into the tuberosity of the os ischium. 2. The internal, or aiUcrinr, arises from the edge of the transverse processes of the sacrum, and of the os coccygis; it passes across on the inside of the externa!, and is inserted into the point of the spinous process of the ischium. thft( 81 ) the trochanter major 5 sends off a great quantity of tendinous fibres, to be inseparably joined to the fascia lata of the thigh ; and is Inserted, into a rough surface at the upper and outer part of the linea aspera, immediately below the trochanter major; also very extensively into the tascia lata, which covers the former insertion. Situation : It is quite superficial, covering all tha other muscles which are situated on the back-part of the hip, covering also the tuber ischii, and the ten- dons of the muscles which arise from that projection. Its insertion lies between the vastus externus and the adductor magnus femoris, and immediately above the origin of the short head of the biceps flexor cruris: — so much adipose membrane is en- tangled with this muscle, that it is very difficult to dissect it clean, and quite impossible, if you do not dissect in the course of the fibres, which are di- vided into very large and strong fasciculL Use: To restore the thigh, after it has been bent; —to rotate it outwards ; to extend the pelvis on the thigh, and maintain it in that position in the erect posture of the body. Synonyma: Gluteus magnus;—Gluteus major;— Ilio-sacro-feraoral. The muscle is now to be lifted from its origin, and left hanging by its tendon; remark the large bursa Hiucosa formed between the tendon and the trochan- ter major; and another between its insertion into the fascia and the tendon of the vastus externus, 2. The Gluteus Medius—Ari$esj fleshy^ frona £) 5 all{ S2 ) all the outer edge of the spine of the os ileum, as far as the posterior tuberosity ; from the dorsum of the bone, between the spine, and semicircular ridge, (which passes from the anterior superior spinous pro- cess to the ischiatic notch); also from the rough sur- face which extends from the anterior superior to the anterior inferior spinous process, and from the inside of a fascia which covers its anterior part. The fibres converge into a strong and broad tendon, which is Inserted into the upper and outer part of the great troclianter. Situation: The posterior part of the belly and the tendon are concealed by the gluteus raaximus, but the anterior and largest part of this muscle is super- ficial, being only covered by a fascia ; it lies behind the origin of the tensor vagince femoris, and above the belly of the pyriforrais; it covers the gluteus minimus. Use : To draw the thigh-bone outwards, or away from the opposite limb ; to maintain the pelvis in a state of equilibrium on the thigh in progression, while the other foot is raised from the ground ; by its posterior fibres to rotate the limb outwards ; and by its anterior inwards. Sjnoni/ma: Ilio-trochanterien. Having lifted up this muscle from its origin, you "Veill discover 3. The Gluteus Minimus—It arises, fleshy, from the semicircular ridge of the ileum, and from the dorsum of the bone below the ridge within half an inch of the acetabulum. Its fibres run in( SS ) in a railiated direction towards a strong tendon, wliicli is Inserted into the anterior and superior part of the grc-at trochanter. Situation : It is entirely concealed by the gluteus medius, and between their tendons there is a butsa mucosa. Use: Same as that of the preceding. Synonpna : Gluteus minor;—Ilio-ischii-trochante- rien. 4. The ryRiFORMis—Arises, within the pelvis, by three tendinous and fleshy origins, from the second, third, and fourth false vertebras or divisions of the sacrum. It forms a thick belly, which passes out of the pelvis below the niche in the posterior part of the ileum, (from whicli it receives a few fleshy fibres), and above the superior sacro-sciatic ligament. Inserted, by a roundish tendon, into the upper- most part of the cavity at the root of the trochanter major. Situation : Like the other small muscles of the hip, it is entirely concealed by the gluteus maximus ; its belly lies behind and below the gluteus medius, but is not at all covered by it, and above the superior gemellus. I ts tendon is covered, at the place of inser- tion, by the posterior fibres of the gluteus mediue. Sometimes the pyriformis is divided into two distinct muscles, by a branch of the great sciatic nerve. Use: To move the thigh a little upwards, and roll >t outwards. S7/7ionyma: Iliacus externus;—Sacro-trochanterien^ ,x) 6 5. The( 8* ) 5. The Gemini consist of two heads, which are distinct muscles. (1.) The superior arises from the back.part of the spinous process of the iscliium. (2.) The inferior from the upper part of the tube- rosity of the OS ischium, and the anterior surface of the posterior sacro-sciatic ligament. Imeried, tendinous and fleshy, into the cavity at the root of the tr.)chanter major, immediately below the insertion of the pyriformis, and above the inser- tion of the obturator externus. Situation : Like the other muscles, they are cover- ed by the gluteus maximus ; they lie below the pyri- formis, and above the quadratus femoris ; they are united by a tendinous and fleshy expansion, which forms a purse or sheath for the tendon of the obtu- rator internus. Use: To roll the thigh outwards, and to bind down the tendon of the obturator internus. Synonyma : Gcmelli;—Part of the marsupialis ;— Ischio-spini-trochantirien Lying between the bellies of the gemini, you will perceive, 6. The Obturator Internus.—It arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from more than one half of the internal circumference of the foramen thyroideum, and from the inner surface of the ligament which fills up that hole ; its inside is covered by a portion of the levator ani; it forms a flattened tendon, which passes out of the pelvis in a sinuosity betwixt thet Epinous process and tuberosity of the ischium : and Uecomirg rounder, is Juserted( So ) Inserted into the pit at the root of the trochaiiter major. Situation : Its origin lies within the pelvis, and cannot be exposed till the contents of that cavity are removed; the tendon, where it passes through the notch in the ischium, is seen projecting between the two origins of the geraelli, and is covered by the gluteus maxiraus ; but, farther forward, it is enclosed as in a sheath, and concealed by the gemelli, and is inserted between thera. There is a bursa mucosa betwixt the tendon of this muscle, and the surface of the ischium over which it glides. Use : To roll the os femoris obliquely outwards. Syiionyma: IVIarsupialis seu Bursalis;—Intra-pel- vio.trochanterien. 7. The QuADRATUs Femoris—Arises, ten- dinous and flesh}', from an oblique ridge, which de- scends from the inferior edge of the acetabulum along the body of the ischium, between its tubero- sity and the foramen thyroideum; its fibres run transversely, to be Inserted flesh}', into a rough ridge on the back part of the femur, extending from the root of the. greater trochanter to the root of the lesser. Situation: It is concealed by the gluteus maximus, lies below the inferior head of the gemini, and above the superior fibres of the adductor magnus; its origin is in contact with the origin of the hamstring muscles. Use: To roll the thigh outwards. Synonyma : Tuber-ischio-trochanterien. On hfting up the quadratus femoris from its ori- gin, and leaving it suspended by its insertion, you discover.f S6 ) discover, running in the same direction, the strong tendon of, 8. The Obturator Externus.—This muscle arises, fleshy, from almost the whole circumference of the foramen thy:-oidcum, and from the external surface of the obturator ligament; its fibres pass out- wards through the notch placed between the in- ferior margin of the acetabulum and the tuberosity of the ischium, wind around the cervix of the os fe- moris, adhering to the capsular ligament, and ter- minate in a strong tendon, which is Inserted into the lowermost part of the cavity, at the root of the trochanter major, immediately below the insertion of the inferior head of the gemini. Situation : This muscle cannot be distinctly seen, until all the muscles which run from the pelvis to the upper part of the thigh are removed, both on the fore and back part; its origin lies on the fore-part, and is concealed by the muscles situated there, as the pectinaeus, triceps, &c. and on the back-part the tendon is concealed by the quadratus femorls, and, when that muscle is removed, it is found to run along the lower edge of the inferior head of the gemini. Use: To roll the thigh-bone obliquely outwards. Synonymn : Extra-pelvio-pubi-trochanterien. 9. The Biceps Flexor Cruris—Arises, by two distinct heads; the first, called the Long Head, arises in common with the semitendinosus, by a short tendon, from the outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, descending, forms a thick fleshy belly. —The second, termed the Short H:ead, arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the linea aspera, immediately below{ 8' ) beIo\r the insertion of the gluteus maximus; and from the oblique ridge running to the outer condyle, where it is connected with the fibres of the vastus ex- ternas. The two lieads unite at an acute angle, a little above the external condyle, and terminate in a strong tendon, which is Inserted into a rough surface on the outside of the head of the fibula. Situafion: The long head of this muscle is con- cealed at its upper part by the inferior fibres of the gluteus maximus ; below this, it is situated quite su- perficial, immediately under the f.^scia, running from the pelvis to the knee between the vastus cxternus and semitendinosus, and forming the outer ham- string.—The short head is partly concealed by the long head, its fibres arise from the linea aspera, be- tween those of the adductor magnus and vastus ex- ternus ;—it forms the outer hamstring. Use: To bend the leg, and particularly by means of its shorter head to twist the leg outwards in the bent state of the knee. Synoiiyma : Biceps cruris ;—Ischio-femoro-pero- nien. 10. The Semitendinosus — Arises, tendinous, in common with the long head of the biceps, from the tuberosity of the ischium; it has also some fleshy fibres arising from that projection more outwardly :—as it descends, it arises, for two or three inches, fleshy,from the inside of the tendon of the biceps ; forms a thick belly, and terminates at the distance of three or four inches from the knee in a long round tendon, which, becoming( 88 ) becoming flat, passes behind the head of the tibia, and is reflected forwards, to be Inserted into the anterior angle of that bone, some little way below its tubercle. Situation : This muscle, as well as the biceps, is covered above by the gluteus maximus; its belly lies between the biceps flexor and gracilis, and is situated entirely superficial; its tendon is inserted below that of the gracilis ; The belly of this muscle is intersect- ed, about its middle, by a narrow transverse tendi- nous line. Use : To bend the leg backwards, and a little in- wards, Synonyma : Seminervosus ;—Ischio-creti-tibial. 11. The Semimembranosus—Arises, by a strong round tendon, from the upper and outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium ; the tendon, soon becom- ing broader, sends off obliquely a fleshy belly ; this muscle is continued, fleshy, much lower down than that last described.—The fleshy fibres terminate ob- liquely in another flat tendon, which passes behind the inner condyle, sends oflf a thin aponeurotic ex- pansion under the inner head of the gastrocnemius, to cover the posterior part of the capsule of the knee-joint, and to be affixed to the external condyle: the tendon then becoming rounder, is Inserted into the inner and back part of the head ©f the tibia. Sititation : This is a semi-penniform muscle; its origin l:»s anterior to the tendinous origin of the two last muscles, and at the same time more outwardly, being( 89 ) being situated between them and tlic origin of the quadratiis tbmoris :—its belly, in its descent, is at first concealed by tl\e biceps and semitendinosus ; but, at its lower part, it a[)pears projecting betu eeu them. It lies in contact with the posterior suri'ace of the triceps magnus. Use : To bend the legs backwards. S^iion^ma: Ischio popliti-tibial. Tl)e two last-described muscles properly form the inner hamstring; but some enumerate among the tenJo;is of tlie inner hamstring, the sartorius and gracilis. § S. VUSSELS AND NERVES ON THE POSTE- niOR PART OF THE THIGH. ARTERIES, 1. Arteria Glutea, or Iliaca Posterior.— This is the largest branch of the internal ihac artery; it passes out of the pelvis at the upper part of tiie sciatic notch. On raising the gluteus maximus, and niedius, this artery is seen coming over the py- riformis; betwixt the superior edge of that muscle and the inferior edge of the os ileum, (where that bone forms the upper part of the sciatic notch), and immediately behind the posterior fibres of the gluteus minimus. The principal trunk passes under the gluteus medius, and ramifies on the dorsum of the os ileum; other large branches are also continued to the gluteus maximus, and the muscles situated on the back part of the pelvis. 2. Arteria Sciatica, vel Iscihatica, is another luige branch of the intL-rnul iliac, which comes out from( 90 ) from under the pyriformis, betwixt the lower edge of that muscle and the superior socro sciatic ligament; it lies upon" the back-part of the hip, under the glu- teus maxinius ;—its principal branches descend be- tween the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium; it sends other twigs round towards the anus and perineum. Both these arteries inosculate with the other branches of the internal and external iliac. The Veins correspond exactly to the arteries. They terminate in the internal iliac vein. NERVES. Neuvus Sciaticus, vel Ischiaticus, or the Great Sciatic Nerve, is seen coming out of the pelvis, along with the sciatic arter)', below the pyriformis. It descends over the gemini and quadratus femoris in the hollow betwixt the great trochanter and the tube- rosity of the ischium,—runs down the back-part of the thigh, anterior to, i.'e. nearer the bone than the hamstring muscles; being situated between the ante- rior surface of the semimembranosus, and the poste- rior surface of the triceps adductor longus. After sending off the peroneal nerve, it arrives in the Iiam, and becomes the Popliteal Nerve. In this course it gives off several branches to the muscles and inte- guments. It sometimes perforates the belly of the pyriformis by distinct trunks, which afterwards unite. SECT( 91 ) SECT. III. DIS5t:CTION OF THE HAM AND FASCIA ON THE BACK PART Of THE TWIGH. ON removing the integuments from the back-part of the knee-joint antl leg, we observe a Fascia, which covers tlie great vessels and the muscles. It is evidently continued from the great fascia of the thigh, is strengthened by adhesions to the condyles of the femur, and to the head of the fibula, and is prolonged upon the muscles on the back of the leg. Upon dissecting back that part of the fascia which covers the ham, theGiiEAT Sciatic Nerve appears, lying between the outer and inner hamstring-muscles. This nerve, having given off branches about the ham, and to the integuments on the back of the leg, di- vides at some distance above the condyles of the femur into two large branches. 1. The Greater Nerve continues its course betwixt the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles. In the ham it is named the Popliteal Neuve, and where it descends in the leg. Posterior Tibial. 2. The lesser Nerve, which is the external branch is named the Peroneal or Fibular Nerve ; it passes outwards and obliquely downwards, runs be- tween the external head of the gastrocnemius, and the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris; and sinks among the muscles v/hich surround the head of the fibula. BRANCriEa( ^>2 ) BRANCHES OF THE PERONEAL NERVE. (1.) Cutaneous branches are sent off from the pe- roneal nerve at its uppermost part over the gastrocne- mius to the integuments in the back-part of the leg, and outer side of the foot. Branches also are dis- tributed about the joint. (2.) A large brancli, the Aktehior Tibial NervEj passes under the flesh of the peroneus lon- gus s.pA extensor longus digitorum, where those muscles arise from the heads of the fibula and tibia; and comes in contact with the anterior tibial artery, which it accompanies down the leg. (3.) Another branch passes into the upper extre- mity of the peroneus longus, and is continued in the substance of that muscle for some space. It then emerges from beneath it, and continues its course \inder the muscles on the fore-part and outside of the leg ; it pierces this fascia, and, becoming cutaneous, is lost on the ankle and upper surface of the foot. Belo'.v the great sciatic nerve, there is much cellu- lar membrane and fat, which being removed, the Gkeat Popliteal Vein is exposed. It adheres to the Popliteal Artery, which lies tinder it close upon the bone. Arteria Poplitea is the trunk of the Femoral, v/hich assumes that name, afl.er ithas perforated the tendon of the triceps. It lies bctv.-een the condyles of the femur, close upon the bone, and descends between the heads of the gastrocnemius. It runs over the po- plitcus, and under the gastrocnemius, that is, in the erectI ( ) erect position it is anterior to tlie gastrocnemius, and posterior to the popliteus: at the lower ecl^e ol" the popliteus, the popliteal artery divides into the Ax rii- lUOK and Posterior Tibial Arteuies. BRA\'CIIES. 1. Two PEnroRATiNG Arteries come off from the artery immediately after it has entered the ham;—they arc small, and perforate from the haai to the fore-part of the thigh. 2. Articular xVrteries are four or five small tM"igs, ramifying over the knee-joint snd neighbour- , ing muscles, inosculating with one another, and with the arteries below the knee. 3. Two branches are sent to the two heads of the , gastrocnemii muscles; twigs are also given to the / soleus, plantaris, <S:c. The Popliteal Veix receives branches corre- sponding to those of the artery; it lies behind the artery in the erect posture. About two Inches above the condyle, it receives the VEN.i Saphena Minor, which returns the blood from the outer side of the foot; the trunk «i" this vein lies under the lascia. CJIAP,( ) CHAP. V. DISSECTION OF THE LEG AND FOOT. SECT. I. OF THE FOUE-PATIT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. ^^N dissecting off the integuments from the fore- part of the leg, we find a strong fascia conti- nued from the thigh : it adheres firmly to every pro- jecting point of the bone, to the head and fpine of the tibia, and to the fibula ; it grows thinner towards the lower part of the leg ; but where it passes over the ankle, it again becomes very strong by its adhe- sions to the outer and inner ankle, and forms a strong Annular or TaANsvERst Ligament, which binds down the tendons, and is evidently but a thicker and stronger part of the general fascia of the leg. This annular ligament seems to consist of two distinct cross bands, which, going from the point of tlie outer ankle and neighbouring part of the 06 calcis, are fixed to the malleolus internus, and to the inside of the OS naviculare. Before removing the fascia, it will be proper to remark, I. The vena saphena major, running upon the 1 inside( f)-^ ) inside of the tibia, and accompanied by a cutaneous nerve, the nei vus saphenus. 2. Several cutaneous nerves, branching on tlie outer and fore part of the leg and foot, and derived lro!ii the nervus pcroneus. The fascia should then be dissected OiT; and, in doing this, remark, that it is firmly attached to the bones, and also to the bellies of the muscles at the upper part of the leg, so that their surfaces appear ragged, where the fibres are separated which arose from the inside of the fascia: Remark also that it sends down processes between the muscles; these are nam.ed intermuscular ligaments, Q.r tendons; they give origin to the fibres of all the muscles betwixt which they pass, connecting them together insepa- rably, so that the dissection is difficult, and has a rough appearance. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FORE-PART AND OUTSIDE OF THE LEG. These are six in number. 1. The Tibialis Anticus—Arises, principally fleshy, from the exterior surfiice of the tibia, from its anterior angle or spine, and from nearly half of the interosseous ligament; from these surfaces it con- tinues to arise down two-thirds of the length of the bone ; also from the inner surface of the fascia of the leg, and from the intermviscular ligaments. The fleshy fibres descend obliquely, and terminate in a strong tendon, which crosses from the outside to the fore-part of the tibia, passes through a distinct ring of the( 90 ) the annular ligament near tlie inner ankle, runs erec- tile astragalus and os naviculare, and is Inserted into the uj)per and inner part of the os cunciforme internum, and the base of the metatarsal bone supporting the great toe. Siludiion : The beiiy is quite superficial, lying un- der the fascia of the leg on the outside of the spine of the tibia; the insertion of the tendon is concealed in part by the adductor and flexor brevis of the great toe. Between the tendon of this muscle and the os cuneiforme, we find a small bursa mucosa. Use: To draw the foot upwards and inwards; or, in other words, to bend the ankle joint. Synonyma : Tibio-sus-metatarsien. 2. Extensor Longus Digitorum Pedis— Arises, tendinous and flesh}^, from the outer part of the head of the tibia; from the head of the fibula; from the anterior angle of the fibula almost its whole length ; and from part of the smooth surface between the anterior and internal angles ; from a small part of the interosseous ligament; from the fascia and inter- muscular ligaments. Below the middle of the leg, it splits into four round tendons, which pass under the annular liga- ment, becomes flattened, and are Inserted into the root of the first phalanx of each of the four small toes, and expanded over the upper side of the toes as far as the root of the last phalanx. Situation :■ This muscle also runs entirely superfi- cial ; it lies between the tibialis anticus and peroneuE longus, being firmly connected to them by intermus- cular( 97 ) .cular ligaments; but, at the lower part of the leg, it is separated from the tibialis anticus by tlie extensor 1 poUicis longus, and from the peroneus longus by the I peroneus brevis. Use : To extend all the joints of the four small : toes :—to bend the ankle joint. Si/iioni/ma: Peroneo-tibi-sus-phalangettiea cora- 1 mun. Peroneus Tv.RTivs-^Arises, fleshy, from the : anterior angle of the fibula, and from part of the : smooth surface between the anterior and internal . angles, extending from below the middle of the bone downwards to near its inferior extremity; sends its • fleshy fibres forwards to a tendon, which passes ; under the annular ligament, in tlie same sheath as the I extensor digitorum longus, and is Inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone that : supports the little toe. Situated : The belly is inseparably connected with 1 the extensor longus digitorum, and is properly the ' outer part of it; it lies between that muscle and the peroneus brevis. The tendon runs down on the out- side of that tendon of the extensor longus digitorum ' which goes to the little toe. Tlie whole of the muscle is superficial. Use : To assist in bending the foot. Synompna : Nonus Vesalii;—Petit-peroneo-sus- metatarsieri. 4. ExtensorProprius Pollicis Pedis—z?wc^, • tendinous and fleshy, from part of the smooth surface between the anterior and internal angles of the fibula, and from the neighbouring part of the interosseous E ligarant,( 98 ) ligament, extending from some distance below tlie head of the bone to near its inferior extremity; a few fibres also arise from the lower part of the tibia; the fibres pass obhquely downwards and forwards into a tendon, which, inch'ning inwards, passes over the fore-part ofthe^5Stragalus and os naviculare,and over the junction of the os cunieforme internum and os cuneiforme medium, to be Liserted into the base of the first and of the second phalanges of the great toe *. Situation : The belly is concealed between the tibialis anticus and extensor digitorum longus, and cannot be seen till those muscles are separated from one another ;—the tendon is superficial, running be- tween the tendons of those two muscles. Use: To extend the great toe; and to bend the ankle. Si/tionj/ma : Extensor longus pollicis ;—Peroneo- sus-phalanginicn du pouce. 5.

Situation: The belly is quite superficial; it lies between the outer edge of the extensor longus digi- torum and the anterior edge of the soleus, connected -to both by intermuscular ligaments. The tendon is superficial where it crosses the outside of the os calcis, but, in the sole of the foot, is concealed by the mus- cles situated there, and will be seen in the dissection of that part. Use : To extend the ankle joint, turning the sole of the foot outwards. Synonyma : Peroneus maximus, vulgo, Peroneus posterior;—Peroneus primus, seu posticus;—Tibi- peroneo-tarsien. 6. The Peroneus Brevis— Arises, fleshy, from the outer edge of the anterior angle of the fibula, and from part of the smooth surface behind that angle ; beginning about one third down the bone, and conti- nuing its adhesion to near the ankle ; from the fhscia of the leg, and from the intermuscular ligaments :— The fibres run obliquely towards a tendon, which passes through the groove of the fibula behind the outer ankle, being there inclosed in the same liga- ment with the tendon of the peroneus longus, then E 2 through /( 100 ) *hl'Ough a separate groove on the outside of the ot ealcis, and is Inserted into the external part of the base of the metatarsal bone that sustains the little toe. Siluuiion : This muscle arises between the e - tensor longus digitorum and peroneus longus; its belly is overlapped, and concealed by the belly of the peio- neus longus; but, as it continues fleshy lower down, it is seen, above the ankle, projecting on each side of the tendon of that muscle: Below, it is separated from the peroneus tertius by that projection of the fibula which forms the outer ankle, and which is only covered by the common integuments. The tendon, where it passes through the groove of the fibula, lies under that of the peroneus longus, i. e. nearer the bone; but it is soon seen before it, and, on the side oi' the OS calcis, runs above it.

Arteria Tibialis Antica.—The anterior tibial artery passes from the ham betwixt the inferior edge of the popliteus, and the superior fibres of the soleus, and then through a large perforation in the interos- seous ligament, to reach the fore-part of the leg; this perforation is much larger than the size of the artery, and is filled up by the fibres of the musculous tibialis posticus, which may thus be said to arise from ilie fore-part of the tibia.—The artery then runs dowa E 3 dose( 102 ) close upon the middle of the interosseous ligament, between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis; below the middle of the leg, it leaves the interosseous ligament, and passes gradually more for- wards ; it crosses under the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis*, and is then situated between that tendon, and the first tendon of the extensor longus digitorum : at the ankle it runs over the fore-part of the tibia, being now situated more superficially ; then over the astragalus and os naviculare, and over the Junction of the os cunieforme internum and medium; crossing under that tendon of the extensor brevis di- gitorum which goes to the great toe.—Arriving at the space between the bases of the two first metatarsal bones, it plunges into the sole of the foot, and imme- diately joins the plantar arch. BRANCHES. 1. A. Eecurrens, which ramifies over the fore- part of the knee, inosculating with the articular arteries. 2. Numerous twigs to the tibialis anticus, extensor pollicis, and other muscles on the fore part of the leg. 3. A. Malleolaris Interna ramifies over the inner ankle, and inosculates with the perineal and posterior tibial arteries. 4. The External Malleolar ramifies over the outer ankle. ♦ It is crossed by that tendon just above the lower head of the tibia, while under the annular ligament. 5. The( 103 ) 5. The Tarsal and Metatarsal Arteries are two small branches which cross the tarsal and meta- tarsal bones, and pass obliquely to the outer edge of the foot. From the tarsal or metatarsal artery .come off the Interosseal Arteries, which supply the interos- seal spaces, and the back-part of the toes. 6. A large branch comes off from the anterior tibial, where it is about to plunge into the sole of the foot; it runs along the space betwixt the two first metatarsal bones, and that the anterior extremity of those bones, bifurcates into, (1.) A. DoRSALis Hallucis, a considerable branch which runs on the back-part of the great toe. (2.) A branch which runs on the inner edge of the toe next to the great one. 2. VEINS. The Anterior Tirial Vein consists of two branches, which accompany the artery and its rami- fications. 3. NERVES. The Anterior Tibial Nerve is a branch si' the peroneal nerve ; it is seen in the ham arising from the peroneal, and crossing under the muscles on the outside of the fibula:—It emerges from under the extensor longus digitorura, comes in contact with the anterior tibial artery, and accompanies it down the leg; it is distributed on the back of the foot and toes. E 4» SECT.C( 104< ) SECT. II. DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE LEG. The fascia which invests the posterior part of the ' leg, is mucli thinner and less strong than in the fore- part ; it must be removed, to expose the parts no\r to be described. MUSCLES ON THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE LEG. Those are seven in number. 1. The Gastrocnemius Exterxus, or Gemel- lus—Arises, by two distinct heads;—The first, or Internal Head, arises, tendinous, from the upper and back.part of the internal condyle of the os fcraoris, and flesliy from the oblique ridge over that condyle. —The second, or External Head, arises in the same manner, from the external condyle. Each of the heads forms a fleshy belly, the fibres of wliich are oblique, passing from a tendinous expansion which covers the posterior surface of the muscle to another tendinous expansion vphich covers the anterior sur. face, or that surface which lies nearest the bones. The two bellies, of which the internal is by much the largest, are separated by a considerable triangular i iterval, in which the popliteal blood-vessels and nerves pass to the leg, but descending, unite a little below the knee-joint in a middle tendinous line, and below the middle of the tibia send oS' a broad flat tendon, which unites a little above the ankle with the tendon of the soleus. Reflfct( 105 ) Reflect the two heads af the gastrocnemius from the femoral condyles, and you will then expose 2..The SoLEUs, or Gastrocnemius Inteknus— which mises, by two origins or heads. The first, or External Origin, which is by much the largest, in ises, principally fleshy, from the posterior surface of the head of the fibula, and from the external angle of that bone, for two thirds of its length, immediately behind the peroneus longus. The second, or internal head, arises, fleshy, from an obUque ridge on the pos- terior surface of the tibia, just below the popliteus, and from the inner angle of that bone, during the middle third ol' its length. The two heads which are ■Beparatgd at first by the posterior tibial artery and nerve, unite immediately, form a large belly, which, CQvered by the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is con- tinued, fleshy, to within a short distance of the ankle- joint; a little above which the tendons of the gas- trocnemius and soleus unite, and form a strong round tendon, named the Tendon Aciullis, which slides over the upper and posterior part of the os calcis, /where it is furnished with a small bursa mucosa, »1;o be Inserted into a rough surface on the back-part of that bone. Situation ; The gastrocnemius arises between the hamstring-tendons: Its belly is superficial, and forme the upper or greater calf of the leg : on lifting it up, the tendon is seen continued some way on its inner surface. The soleus lias its largest part concealed by the igastrocneraiuSj but part of it appears oh each side of £ 5 th^( 106 ) the belly of that muscle ; and, at the lower part of the leg, the belly, is seen projecting through the ten- don of the gastrocnemius, and forming the lower calf. Its fleshy belly is tendinous on its posterior surface, where the tendon of the gastrocnemius slides over it; and there is a bursa mucosa betwixt the upper part of the os calcis, and the tendo Achillis. Use: To elevate the os calcis, and thereby, to lift- up, the whole body, as a preparatory measure to its being carried forward in progression ;—to carry the leg backwards on the foot when that is fixed ;—the gastrocnemius, from its origin in the thigh, also bends the leg on the thigh. Synonyma: Gastrocnemius : — Bi-femoro-calea- nien, SoLEus: Tibio-peronei-calcanien. Both muscles are sometimes called Extensor Tarsi Suralis, vel Extensor Magnus. The heads of the gastrocnemius should now be lifted up,w hich will expose 3. The Plantaris.—This muscle arises, fleshy, •from the upper part of the external condyle, and from the oblique ridge above that condyle, forms a pyramidal belly about three inches in length, which adherses to the capsule of the knee-joint, runs over the popliteus, and terminates in a long, slender, thin tea- don. This tendon passes obliquely inwards over the inner head of the soleus, and under the gastrocnemius; €merges from between those two muscles, where their tendons unite, and then runs down by the inside of the tendo Achillis, to be Inserted nAo i he posterior part of the os calcis, on 9 the( 107 ) tlie inside of the insertion of the tendo Achlllis, and somewhat before it. Situation : Tile origin and belly of this muscle are concealed by the external head of the gastrocnemius ; the lower part of the tendon is the only part that is superficial. Use : To extend the foot, and roll it inwards, and to assist in bending the leg. Si/nonyma; Tibialis gracilis ; Extensor tarsi mi- nor :—Petit femoro-calcanien. 4'. The Poj^i-iTEus—within the capsular ligament of the knee, by a round tendon, from a deep pit or hollow on the outer side of the external con- dyle ; adheres to the posterior and outer surface of the external semilunar cartilage ; passes, within the cavity of the joint, over tlie side of the condyle to its back-part; perforates the capsular hgament, and forms a fleshy belly, which runs obliquely inwards, being covered by a thin tendinous fascia, to be Inserted, broad, thin, and fleshy, into an oblique ridge on the posterior surface of the tibia, a little below its head, and into the triangular space above that ridge. Situation : This muscle is concealed entirely by the gastrocnemius; it lies above the inner head of the soleus ; it is more deeply situated than the plantaris, which crosses over it. ^ Use: To bend the leg, and, when bent, to roll it, so as to turn the toes inwards. Synonyma : Femoro-popliti tibial. The belly of the soleus should now be lifted, in order to expose the deeply-seated muscles. A strong r. G uiombiaijuUs( 108 ) membranous fascia is seeii connecting and investin* them, which is to be removed. This fascia also covers the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, but the description of the course of these vessels, though seen in this stage of the dissection, must be deferred. The deep-seated muscles are, 1 he Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis; situated be- hind the tibia. The Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis, situated behind the fibula. The Tibialis Posticus, vrhich is althost concealed by the two other muscles, and by the fascia, which connects them, and binds them down. 5. The Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis Per- TORANS—'Arises, fleshy, from the posterior flattened surface of the tibia, between its internal and external angles, below the attachment of the soleus, and con- tinues to arise from the bone to within two or three inches of the ankle ; the fibres pass obliquely into a tendon which is situated on the posterior edge of the muscle. This tendon runs behind the inner ankle in a groove of the tibia, passes mider a stror g ligament Mhich goes from the inner ankle to the os calcis, and having veceived a strong tendinous slip from the flexor poilicis longus, divides about the middle of the sole of the foot into four tendons, which pass through the slits in the tendon of the flexor digitorum brevis, and are Inserted into the extremity of the last joint of the four lesser toes. Situation : The belly of this muscle is concealed by the soleus, and lies on the inside of the flexor longus t pollicis.( 109 ) -poUicts, The situation of the tendon is described with the muscle situated in the sole oi'th. ^ot, Uae: To bend the last joint of tiie toes, and to assist in extending the foot.

Flexor Lon'gus PoLLrcis Pedis—Arises, fleshy, from the posterior flat surface of the hbula, continuing its origin from some distance below the head of the bone to within an inch of the ankle. The fleshy fibres terminate in a tendon, which passes behind the inner ankle through a groove in the tibia; next through a groove in the astragalus, crosses in the sole of the foot tlie tendon of tlie flexor iongus digitoruni, to which it gives a shp o' tendon; passes between the two sesamoid bones, and is Inserted into the last joint of the great toe. , Situation: The belly of this muscle is covered by the soleus; it hes on the outside of the flexor Iongus digitoruni, between that muscle and the peroneus Iongus; the tendon, where it passes behind the inner ankle, is situated more backward than the ten- don of the flexor digitoruni Iongus, that is, nearer the OS calcis, and will be seen in the foot. Use: i'o bend the last joint of the great toe, and, being connected by a cross slip to the flexor digi- torum communis, to assist in bending the other toec. Synonyma : PeronGo-phalanginien du gros orteil. 7. The Tibialis Posticus—Jmei, fleshy, from the posterior surface of both the tibia and fibula, ira- . mediately below the upper articulation of these bones with each other; from the whole of the interosseous ligament;( 110 ) ligament; from the angles of the bones to which that ligament is attached; and from the flat surface of the fibula behind its internal angle for more than two-thirds of its length. The fibres run obliquely towards a middle tendon, which, becoming round, passes behind the inner ankle through a groove in the tibia. Inserted into the upper and inner part of the os naviculare, being further continued through a groove in that bone to the internal and external cuneiforrae bones; it also sends some tendinous filaments to the OS calcis, the os cubcides, and the bases of the meta- tarsal bones supporting the second and middle toe. Silnatio?i: This muscle may be said to arise from the tibia and fibula before the interosseous ligament, as its fibres fill up a perforation in the upper extre- mity of that ligament. The belly is concealed at its lower part b}- the flexor longus digitorum and flexor pollicis, and cannot be seen till those muscleg are se- parated ; but a part of it is discovered above the upper extremity of these muscles, and immediately below the fibres of the popliteus; and this part must lie under the anterior surface of the soleus. The tendou crosses under that of the flexor longus digitorum above the ankle, and, where it passes through the groove in the tibia, is situated more forward than the tendon of that mi;scle. It is thickened where it runs through the groove of the os naviculare ; and its in- sertion lies ciose in contact with the bones, and is concealed by the muscles in the sole of the foot. Use : To extend the foot, and turn it inwards. Sijnov7/ma : Tibio-tarsien. VESSELS( in ) VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE POSTE- RIOR PART OF THE LEG. 1. ARTERIES. Arteria Tibialis Postica.—The posterior ti" bial artery, which is the continued trunk ofthe pop- liteal, sinks under the origins of the soleus, and runs down the legbetween that muscle andthemore deeply- scattered flexors of the toes: It does not lie in imme- diate contact with the fibres of the flexors, but, like the femoral artery, is invested by a strong sheath of condensed cellular membrane. It is, together with its veins and accompanying nerve, also supported by the fascia which binds down the deep-seated muscles. As it descends, it gradually advances more forwards, following the course of the flexor tendons : it passes behind the inner ankle, in the sinuosity of the os calcis, lying posterior to the lendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and anterior to that of the flexor longus pollicis. Here it is close upon the bone, and its pulsation may be iclt. It sinks Uiider the abductor pollicis, arising from the os calcis, and immediately divides into two branches: (l.j The Internal Plantar Artery is the smallest, and ramifies among the mass of muscles situated on the inner edge of the sole of the foot. (2.) TheExternal i'lantar Artery directs its course outwards, and having reached the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forms the Plantak Ahcii, which crosses the t'n-ee middic metatarsal bones obliquely, about their middle, and terminates at the space be- twixt the two first metatarsal bones, where the trunk ofi 112 ) ef the anterior tibial artery joins the arch. Tlie con- vexity of this arch is towards the toes, and sends off the follo'.ving branches. ft, A small brunch to the outside of the little toe. b, Ramus digitaWs primus, nr the first digital arte- ry, wliich runs along thj spacs oeriveen the two last metatarsal bones, and bifurcates inio two brandies, one to the inner side oi'the iittlf- toe, and the other to the outer side of thf" next toe. c, The second digit d -rfe/y, w'lijh runs along tlie next interosseous space, and bifurcates in a similar manner. d, The third digital artery. e, The fourth, or great digital artery, which snpplies the great toe, and the inner side of the toe next to it. The concavity of the arch sends offtheinterosseal •arteries,tlireeorfoui'small twigs, whichgoto the deep- seated parts in the sole ofthe foot, and, perforating be- tween the metatarsal bones, inosculate with the supe- rior interosseal arteries on the upper side ofthe foot. The branches of the Posterior Tibial Artery ia the leg are, 1. The Peroneal Artery, which comes off from the tibial a little after it has sent off the anterior ti- l)ial, of which this arterjf is sometimes a branch ; it is generally of a considerable size, sometimes nearly as large as the tibial itself; it runs upon the inside of the fibula, giving numerous branches to the peroneal muscles and flexor of the great toe; but its course is irregular and inconstant. At the lower part of the leg, it splits into, a, A. Peronea Anterior, which passes betwixt the( 113 ) tlie lov/er heads of tlie tibula and fibula, to the fore- part of tlie ankle, where it is-lost. b, A. Peronea Posteuior is properly the tor- niination of the artery ; it descends along the sinuo- sity of the OS calcis, inosculating with the branches of the tibialis postica, and terminates in the posterior part of the sole of the foot. 2. iNIuscular branches arise from the artery as it descends; twigs also ai-e sent over the heel and ankle. 2. VEINS. Ven.^: Tibiales PosticjE.—The posterior tibial veins are generally two in number; they accompany the artery, and terminate in the popliteal vein; they are formed of branches, which correspond to those of the artery. S. NERVES. The Posterior Tibial Nerve, which is the continuation of the great sciatic nerve, sinks below the soleus, and accompanies the posterior tibial ar- tery ; it gives off numerous filaments to the muscles in its neighbourhood. At first it continues, as in the ham, immediately behind the artery, but it gra- dually gets on tiie outside of it as it descends : so that where they pass along the sinuosity of the os calcis, the nerve is situated close in contact with the side of the artery, but neai-er to the projection of the heel than that vessel is. With the artery, it divides into, 1. The internal plantar nerve, and, 2. The external plantar nerve.—These nerves supply the muscles and integuments in tiie sole of the foot. SECT,{ Hi ) SEC. III. DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. THE cuticle is very much thickened on the sole of the foot from constant pressure ; betwixt the inte- guments and plantar aponeurosis, we find a tough granulated fat, which adheres firmly to the aponeu- rosis, and is dissected off with difficulty. Aponeurosis, sou Fascia Plantaris, is a very strong, tendinous expansion, which arises from the projecting extremity of the os calcis, and passes to the root of the toes, covering and supporting the muscles of the sole of the foot. Where it arises from the heel, it is thick, but narrow ; as it runs over the foot, it becomes broader and thinner; and it is fixed to the head of each of the metatarsal bones by a bi- furcated extremity, vphich, by its splitting, leaves room for the tendons, &c. to pass. It seems divided into three portions, which are connected by strong fasciculi of tendinous fibres ; and fibres are sent down^ forming perpendiciUar partitions among the muscles, and separating them into three classes. 1. The middle portion Mhich is the largest, and under which are contained the flexor brevis digito- rum, and the tendons of the flexor longus and lum- bricales. 2. The external lateral portion, which covers the muscles of the little toe. 3. The internal lateral portion, concealing the muscles of the great toe. On removing the plantar aponeurosis, the first order( 115 ) order of muscles in the sole of the foot is exposed: it consists oi' three muscles : Abductor Follicis, situated on the side of the : great toe. Abductor Minimi Digiti, on the side of the little toe. Flexor Brevis Digitorum Pedis, the mass in the middle situated between the two abductors, 1. Abductor PoLLicis Pedis—Arises, tendinous ; and fleshy, from the lower and inner part of the os I calcis; from a ligament which extends from the os I calcis to the os naviculare; from the inside of the os 1 naviculare and cuneiforrae internum ; and from the ! fascia pi an tar is. Inset-ted, tendinous, into the internal sesamoid 1 bone, and base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Use: To move the great toe from the rest. Synonyma: Thenar-calcanoo-phalangieni dupouce. 2.

Tlexob, Brevis Digitorum Pedis Per-( IIG ) \- ToRATXJS-^Arises, fleshy from the anterior and in- ferior part of the protuberance of the os calcis, and from the inner surface of the fascia plantaris; also from the tendinous partitions betwixt it and the ab- ductors of the great and little toe :—it forms a thick fleshy belly, and sends off four tendons, which split for the passage of the tendons of the flexor longus digitorura, and are Inserted into the second phalanx of the four lesser toes. 1'he tendon of the little toe is often wanting. Use : To bend-the second joint of the toes. Synonyma: Calcaneo phalanginien comraun. Situation : The muscles of this order are quite su- perficial, being only covered by the fascia plantaris. The first order of muscles being removed, or be- ing lifted from their origins, and left hanging by their tendon, the second order is exposed. 1. The tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum pedis is seen coming from the inside of the os calcis; and having reached the middle of the foot, dividing into its four tendons, which pass through the slits of the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis, and are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes. 2. The tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis is seen crossing under ' the tenijon of the flexor longus digi- torum, and, having given to it a shojt slip of tendon, * III the erect posture, it aosses above, lyini nenrcr to tlie metatarsal boues tliaii lliat tendon ; but in the description, the sole of the foot is supposed to be placed uppcrniobt.( 117 ) 1 proceeding between the two sesamoid bones to tliig : base of the hist phahjnx of the great toe. : 3.

Situation : The mliscles of the second order are < covered and concealed by those of the first or J.er; : but the insertion of their tendinous extremities may i be seen on removing the integuments. The second order of muscles being removed, we I expose the third order. 1. Flexor Bkevis Pollicis Pedis It arises, I tendinous, from the under and fore part of the os calcis, where it. joins with the os cuboides; also from the os cuneiforme externum ; It forms a fleshy belly, which is connected inseparably to the ab- . ductor and adductor pollicis.

Ranging with this order of muscles, we may also observe, A broad strong ligament, passing from the ante- rior sinuosity of the os calcis over the surface of the OS cuboides. The tendon of the tibialis posticus, dividing into rnumerous tendinous slips, to be inserted into the bbones of the tarsus. Situation: The muscles of the third order lie under tithose of the second order, but are only partially con- ccealed : —The flexor brevis pollicis lies under the ten- ddon of the flexor longus pollicis ; the adductor polli- ccis lies on the outer side of the flexor brev s, and is iin part concealed bv the tendons of the flexor digito- rrum longus.—The flexor brevis minimi digiti is a small lifleshj' mass, lying on the metatarsal bone of the little ' foe, and not concealed by any muscle of the second 0order.—The transversalis pedis runs across under the ttendons of the flexor digitorum longus and lumbri- ccalcs, and is seen projecting betwixt those tendons. Having removed the muscles last described, we eexpose the fourth and last order. 1'he tendon of the peroneus longus is seen passing •along a groove in the os cuboides, and crossing the tarsal bones, to be inserted into the base of the meta- i tarsal bone of the great toe, and into the internal ituneiforme and second metatarsal bone.?. Inter-( 120 ) Inteuossei Pedis Interni, arc three in num- ber, situated in the sole of the foot.—The)^ arise, tendinous and fleshy, from between the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes, and are Inserted, tendinous, into the inside of the base of the first phalanx of each of the thfee lesser toes.

SECT. 1. ■OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. ^"^HE integuments of the head are thick, and C0- ■ vered with hair; under the cutis there is a cel- lular substance, which is much condensed, and closely connected with the epicraniura, or expanded tendon of the occipito-frontalis. This connection renders the dissection of that muscle difficult. The OcciPiTO-FRONTALis is the only muscle which properly belong to the hairy scalp; it is a single broad digastric muscle, Arising, on each side of the head, fleshy an^ten- dinous, from the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, as far forwards as the mastoid process;—it forms a broad thin tendon, which covers tho whole upper part of the craniara. Inserted, fleshy, on each side, into the orbicularis palpebrarum, skin of the eye-brows, and the internal angular process of the oa frontis and os nasi. F Situation t( 122 ) Silttation : The tendon adheres firmly by cellular membrane to the skin, but very loosely to the peri- cranium, or periosteum of the cranium. At its in- sertion it intermixes with the muscles of the upper part of the face. Use : To pull the skin of the head backwards, Taise the eye-brows, and corrugate the skin of the forehead. Synonymn : Epicranins ;—Frontalis et occipitalis. The muscles of the ear are of three classes. ]. The common muscles move the external ear; they are not always so distinct as to admit of a clear demonstration. (1.) Attollf.ns Aurem—Arisen from the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, and from the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle. Inserted into the upper part of the root of the cartilage of the ear, opposite to the antihelix. Use : To draw the ear upr;^'ards. Synovyma : Attollensauricolae;—superiorauris ;— Temporo-conchinien. (2.) Anterior Auris—Arises, thin and mem- branous, from the posterior part of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. Lisei ted into a small eminence on the back of the helix, opposite to the concha. Use: To draw the eminence a little forwards and upwards. Synonyma: Anterior auriculae ;—Z3-gomato.con- chinien. (3.)

A TRANSVERSE incision, extending from ear to ear over the crown of the head, being made through the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the two flaps ma}'^, with facility, be inverted on the face and neck. Remove the superior part of the cranium by a saw directed anteriorly through the frontal bone above the orbitar process, and posteriorly as low as the transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Thus the subsequent demonstration of the brain will be con- ducted with greater facility. When the superior part of the cranium, commonly called the Calvarium, or skull cap, is torn off, which requires considerable force, you expose the Dura Mater, a firm, compact, and whitish membrane, somewhat shining, rough on its outer surface, from the rupture of vessels which connected it to the cra- nium, and covered with bloody spots in consequence of the blood effused from these ruptured orifices. It is described as being separable into many laminae, into( 127 ) into two witli facility ; ami it h said that these \\va lamiiiiv, by separating ami re-unitijig, form the trian- gular cavities, named Sinuses, which are in fact large veins, 'f his division of layers can hm-dly be admitted as correct in the recent state of the membrane. The SuPEKiou LoNGiTUDiNAi, Sinus lies in a groove I'ormed by the two parietal bones; it extemis iilonsr the satjittal suture from the crista calli of the ethmoid bone to the middle of the os occipitis, vviiere it bifurcates into the two lateral sinuses; in its pas- sage backwards, its size is increased. When slit open, its triangular form is evident; it is lined by a smooth membr<me, and in it may be remarked liie numerous openings of the veins of the pia mater, ths frena, or shps of fibres cros-sing from side to side, glandulas Pacchioni internee, et externse, little bodies like millet-seed seen on the oute/ and inner surface of the sinus. The arteries of the dura raater are divided into th& anterior, middle, and posterior. 1. Artekia Mes-'ingea Media, (called also the Spinalis or Spheno-spinalis), the great middle av- teiy, is a branch of the internal maxillary ; it passes through the spinous hole of the sphenoid bone, and is seen arising from the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, (in a groove of which it lies,) and spreading its numerous branches over the dura mater. The anterior and posterior arteries are small. 2. A. Meningea Anterior is sent off from the external carotid, and enters the cranium by the fora- .jnen lacerura orbitale superius. f4 3.A»i 128 ) 3. A. Meni\gea Posterior is given off by the vertebral artery ; the dura mater also receives Email twigs from the occipital, pharyngeal arteries, &c. The nerves of the dura mater are said to come from the fifth pair; if they exist at all, they are email, aud seldom demo)astrated. OF THE SEPTA OF THE BRAIN, OR PROCESSES OF THE DURA MATER. 1. The Falx (septum sagittale, verticale, medias- tinum cerebri, or falciform process) is a long anu broad fold, or duplicature of the inner lamina of the ^ura mater, dividing the cerebrum into two hemi- spheres, extending from the crista galli of the eth- moid bone, along the middle of the os frontis and point of junction of the two parietal boneSyto- the crucial ridge of the occipital bone, where it termi- nates in the middle of the next septum. 2. The Tentorhjm Cerebelli, or transverse septum. This separates the cerebrum from the cere« helium, and is formed by the inner lamina of the dura mater, reflected off" from the os occipitis along the groove of the lateral sinuses, and the edge or angl^ of the temporal bones. It is frequently called- Tentorium Cerebello Super Extensum. Its position- is horizontal. There are some other folds of the dura mater not visible in this stage of the dissection. 3. The falx of the cerebellum, or small occipital septum, will be seen when the cerebrum is re- moved. It extends from the middle of the tento- rlU|ra along, the middle spine of the os occipitis to the( 129 ) the foramen magnum, dividing the cerebellum into two parts. 4. The splienoldal folds, two small folds of the dura mater, one on each side of the sella turcica, stretching from the posterior to the anterior clinoid processes. The dura mater aiso, in many parts of the brain, separates itslaminajto form sinuses; the principle of these will be noticed in the course of the dissection. This membrane should now be divided in the line of the division of the cranium ; its internal surface is smooth, glistening, and free from adhesion, except ia the course of the longitudinal sinus; into which veins pass from the pia mater. Detach the falx from the crista galli, and turn it backwards, observe in its lower edge tlie Inte- rior Longitudinal Sinus, which enters a sinus in the tentorium, termed Torcular Herophili, or straight sinus. This will fully expose the convolu- tions of the brain, which are closely invested by the pia mater. The Pia Mater consists of two membranes. 1. The Tunica Arachngides is a fine mem- brane, covering uniformly the surface of the pia mater, without passing into the interstices of it* duplicatures. It is attached to it, is extremely thin, transparent, without vessels, demonstrated with diffi- culty on the upper surface of llie brain by tlie blow- pipe, (which raises it into cells,) but on the base of the brain it can be distinctly seen. 2. The proper Pia mater, or tunica vasculosa, is a very vascular membrane, transparent in the iiiter- ^ '"j StiCM( 130 ) strces of its vessels, investing the substance of the brain, descending betwixt all its convolutions, and lining its different cavities; but, where it lines the ventricles, it is fine, delicate, and less vascular, than on the surface, and betwixt the convolutions of the brain: It is connected to the dura mater by its veins passing into the longitudinal sinus. The brain is divided into three parts: 1. The cerebrum; 2. The cerebellum ; 3. The medulla ob- longata. The CEREBRtJM consists of two distinct sub- Stances : 1. The cineritious or cortical substance forming the outer part. 2. The white or medullary substance forming the inner part. The brain is divided by the falx into two hemi- spheres, and by the pia mater into numerous convo- lutions. Each hemisphere is divided into three lobes, 1. The Anterior Lobes rest on that part of the cranium which forms the two orbits, and is called the anterior fossae of the basis of the cranium. 2. The Middle Lobes are situated before and above the medulla oblongata, and rest on the middle fossa; of the basis cranii, which are formed by the sphenoid and temporal bones. 3. The Postejuok Lobes are supported by the tentorium. The anterior andmiddlelobes are parted by a deep narrow sulcus, which ascends obliquely backwards ifirom the temporal ala of the os sphenoides to near the( 131 ) the middle of die os pariettile; it Is termed Fissuka Cerebri, or fissiu-a !Magna Silvii. By gently separating with the lingers the two he- ziiLspheres of the brain *, we see passing betwixt them a longitudinal white convex body, the Corpus Cal- LosuM : it lies under the falx, incurvates downwards at both its extremities, and is continued anteriorly into the medullary substance betwixt the corpora striata, posteriorly into the fornix and inferior corriu •of the lateral ventricle on each side. On the surface of the corpus callosum is seen the Raphe, formed by two longitudinal medullary lines united by trans- verse fibres. When the brain is cut horizontally on the level of the corpus callosum, an appearance is produced, termed The Medullary arch, or Centrum Ovale. Under this arch are the two lateral ventriclest. If ■one of these be cautiously perforated on the side of the corpus callosum, and gently inflated by a blow- pipe, its extent may be seen ; but, if much farce be used, the air will pass into the other ventricle. The two ventricles are separated by a medullary partition, which descends from the inferior surface of the corpus callosum to the fornix, the Septum LuDicuM ; it consists of two lamina;, with a narrow * Between the hemisphereg and on the surface of the corpus callosum, we observe the arteriae coliosa, which are the couti- nuation of the truuks of the anterior cerebri. t To show the lateral ventricles, the corpus callosum should be cut away close to the septum iucidum, and then the ventricle of that body, and the thickness and breadth of the septum itself, will be more clearly seen. X Q . caritjrC 132 ) eavlty between. To see this septum, one of the ventricles must be laid open, and the septum pulled gently to the other side. The Lateral Ventricles are two, right and left, lined with a fine membrane, narrow, consisting of a body, and three prolongations or cornua. 1. The body is formed betwixt the corpus callosum, the medulla of the brain, the convexity of the corpus striatum, and the thalamus nervi optici. 2. The anterior cornu or horn is formed betwixt the more acute convexity of the corpus striatum, and the anterior part of the corpus callosum. 3., The posterior cornu (called also the digital cavity) may be traced stretching backwards and downwards into the posterior lobe of the brain. 4. The inferior or descending cornu cannot be traced in this stage of the dissection ; it seems Uke the continued cavity of the ventricle, takes a curve backwards.and outwards, and then, turriing forwards, descends into the middle lobe of the brain. The lateral ventricles communicate with each others and with the third ventricle, by an opening under the fore-part of the arch of the fornix*.. la ♦ It has been doubted whether or not this be an opening the choroid plexus passes through it, and seems to unite iha surfaces; it is abiurcily named the Foramen Monroianum, froia a mistaken notion that Dr. Munro discovered it, and may be seen hy gently turning the anterior crus of the fornix to one side j it is a space betwixt the most anterior part of the con- Texity of the thalami neriorum oplicorum, and the anterior crus •f the fornix. This1 ( 133 ) In the lateral ventricles we meet with, The Fornix, a medulhary body, flat, and of a, triangular shape, which divides the two lateral and the third ventricles. It is exposed on tearing away the septum lucidum ; its lower surface is towards the third ventricle ; its lateral margins are in the lateral ventricles : on its upper surface it supports the sep- tum lucidum, and under its most anterior part is the foramen Monroianum:—One of the angles- of this body is forward, and the other two towards the back- part : it rests chiefly on the thalami nervorum opti- corum, but is separated from them by a vascula? membrane called the velum. The extremities of the body of the fornix are named its Crura. 1. The crus anterius is double, bends downward* before the anterior commissure of the brain, with which it is connected, and may be traced into the corpora caudicautia. 2. The two crura posteriora, coalescing with the back-part of the corpus caliosum, pass, on each side, into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and termiiiate in a pointed form on the hippocampus major. Divide the body of the fornix, invert it^ by turn=. *ng the anterior crus forwards, and the posterior crura backwards; on the under surface of the latter is an This foramen may always be easily found by fellowiiig the course of the plexus choroides, as it passes iocwards in the Tentricle. It is a slit, rather thau a romid hole, iji the natural stale. appears( .134. ) appearance of transverse lines, named Corpus Psal- loides, psalterium, or lyra. The inversion of the forniK exposes The Plexus Chokoides.—This is a continuatioa of the pia matter, a spongy mass, consisting of folds of tortuous vessels, partly covering the thalami ner- vorum opticorum, and continued into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricles. The plexus of each side is connected to its fellow by the velum interpo- situm, a membrane which passes under the fornix, 4ind lies on the third ventricle and corpora quadrige- mina. From this plexus the blood is received by the yENA Galeni situated in the middle of the velum which consists of two parallel branches ; these run backwards, unite, and enter the fourth sinus of the dura matter, called Torcular Herophili. This plexus should now be detached at its fore- part, and turned back ; it will remain as a guide to the knife in tracing the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. We now see, . The Corpora Striata, two smooth cineritious convexities, in the fore-part of the lateral ventricle, broad, and rounded anteriorly, becoming narrow, ^nd diverging as they pass backwards, consisting of medullary and cortical substance disposed in striae. The Thalami Nervorum Opticorum, two large oval whitish eminences, placed by the side of ■each other between the diverging extremities or crura of the corpora striata; towards their fore-part is a peculiar( 135 ) peculiar eminence or convexity, called the Anterior Tubercle; they are elongated downwards, to I'orm the optic nerves. T^NiA Semicircularis, a white medullary line, running in the angle betwixt the corpus striatum and thalamus nervi optici of each side. COMMISSURA ANTERIOR CEREBRI, a short cvlindrical medullary cord, stretched transversely between the fore and lower part of the corpora striata, immediately under the anterior crura of the fornix. Just above the coramissura anterior, and before the thalami, is the Vulva, or foramen commune anterius, a small slit or indentation, formed by the anterior crus of the fornix, bifurcating, and inserting itself, on each side, between the corpus striatum and thalamus nervi optici. This slit is the space by' which the three ventricles communicate. CoMMissuRA Mollis is an exceedingly soft, broad, cineritious junction betwixt the convex sur- faces of the thalami nervorum opticorunl. On separating the optic thalami, we discover the Third Ventriclk.—This is a longitudinal sulcus, or slit, situated betwixt the thalami nervorum opti- corum, and betwixt the crura cerebri. Above, it is covered by the fornix and velum interpositum ; at its upper and fore part, it communicates with the two lateral ventricles; below the commissura anterior, it opens into the infundibulum. This opening is term- ed iter ad infundibulum. Backwards, it is continued by a canal which passes under the tubercula quad- rigemina into the fourth ventricle,—This passage is naxued( ISO ) named iter ad quartura ventriculum, aquacductus Sylvii, or canalis medius. Anus, or foramen commune posterius, is situated behind the commissure of the optic thalami, and be- fore the corpora quadrigemina. It is closed up by the velum interpositum, and, when that is removed, leads into the back part of the third ventricle. The Pineal Gland, a small, soft,, greyish and conical body, of the size of a pea, is seated above the tubercula quadrigemina, and behind the thalami, to which it is connected by t^vo white pedunculi, or foot-stalks; its base is turned forwards, and the apex backwards ; it is covered by the plexus choroides and posterior crura of the fornix. It contains an earthy matter, either in its own substance, or that of the pedunculi; resembling sand, and where viewed by a magnifier assuming a granulated and. clear light yellow appearance. It was named by Soemmerring, who first discovered tl'kat it belongs to the healthy structure of the brain, the acervulus GLANDULiE PINEALIS. CoMMissuRA Posterior, a transverse cord at tlie back-part of the third ventricle, before the tuber- cula quadrigemina, and above the iter ad quartum rentriculura. Tubercula Quadrigemina, four small white bodies, adhering together, lying under the pineal gland, behind the third ventricle, and above the fourth. The uppermost two are named Nates, and the other two Testes. From the under part of the tej-'tcs, there projects .backwards, cQiiaecting itself with the crura cercbelli, a thin( 137 ) a thin medullary lamina, which is the valvula Vieus- senii, processus a cerebello ad testes, velum in>»;r- jectum, valvula major. The inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which descends into the middle lobe of the brain, may now be traced, by following the tract of the choroid plexus * ; in it is seen. The Hippocampus Major, or Cornu Ammoi,iis. At its commencement it is narrow, but it becomes a broad medullary projection of the floor of the ven- tricle, and its extremity, which is called Pr,s Hippo- campi, is curved inwards. The thin edge on its in- side, which follows the whole of its circuit, is named the Corpus Fimbriatum, or Tajnia Hippocampi. The posterior crus of the fornix runs along its inner and anterior part, in the form of a thin floatmg edge. In the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which passes into the posterior lobe of the brain, there is a similar medullary projection, but smaller, the Hippocampus Minor. In the anterior part of the third ventricle, below the iter ad infundibulum, are seen the Corpora Albicantia Willisii, (corpora mamillaria or sub- rotunda) two medullary eminences of the size af peas; the remainder of these bodies is seen on the outer surface of the base of the brain. This completes the demonstration of the cerebrum. The whole of the posterior lobes, and the lateral part of the middle lobes, may be removed. This exposes to your view, * Or it may be exhibited by cutting away successive slices of Uie side of the brain, until the vi;utricle is exposed. The( 138 ) The Tentorium, and the Falx Cerebelli. At this point you should trace the bifurcation of'{lie longitudinal sinus into the two lateral sinuses. The lateral sinuses are formed by the splitting of the laminae of the tentorium; hence they follow the course of that membrane, run along their grooves ia the occipital bone, and dip downwards and forwards through the foramen lacerum in basi crauii, to ter- ininate in the internal jugular veuis. The ToRcuLAR Herophili, or fourth sinus, runs along theiniddle of the tentorium, and joins the extremity of the longitudinal sinus at the point where it bifurcates. The great notch of the tentorium is a circular opening ieft on the anterior part of the tentorium, allowing a juaction between the cerebrum and cere- bellam.' Now proceed to the examination of the cerebellum; and, in order to accomplish this demonstration, it will be convenient to remove the posterior part of the os occipitis. ■ Cerebellum:—Tin's part of the brain, divided into two lobes by the falx cerebelli, or septem occi- pitale, is covered by a vascular membrane ; consists t)f medullary and cineritious substance ; but, instead of convolutions, has numerous deep sulci, into which the pia mater dips, and forms thin flat strata. • Remark the following processes. 1. Appendix, vel processus vermiformis superior, situated under the pia mater, on the anterior and su- perior part of the cerebellum. 2. Appendix, or processus vermiformis posterior, will139 ) will be found situated between the Uvo lobes on thif" under suriace ol'the cerebellum, and iinmedialely be- hind the medulla oblongata. On separating the two lobes behind, and makings a deep incision, we discover, The Fourth Vkntkicle.—The sides of this ventricle are formed by the cerebellum, the anterior part by the medulla oblongata, the upper and back part: by the valvula cerebri; it is lined by a thin vascular membrane, and has on its fore-part a groove or fis- sure, which, terminating in a sharp point, is named Calamus Scriptorius. On each side of this groove are seen several medullary lines, which are the origin pf the portio mollis of the sevenjih pair of nei'ves. The iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum enters the upper part of the fourth ventricle. The valvula cerebri hangs over it. On cutting the cerebellum perpendicularly, there is formed, from the intermixture of cineritious and medullary matter, a tree-like appearance, named Arbor Vit.e, of which the trunk is termed the peduncle of the cerebellum, and is continued to the back-part of the medulla oblongata. This concludes the demonstration of the cerebellum. To demonstrate the medulla oblongata and nerves, either the brain must be removed from the cranium, or it may be gradually inverted in the progress of the demonstration ;—and this is the better method. The inversion must be begun at the fore-part by raising the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. Thus you will see, 1. The First Pair of Merves, The Olfactory, called also Processus Mamillares. They arise from the( 140 ) the outside of the corpora striata, between the ante* rior and middle lobe of the brain; run under the anteriorlobes, being lodged in two superficial grooves, and lying beiween the pia and dura mater; expand into a small oval ganglion, from which several small filaments descend through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, to ramify on the membrane lining the nose. 2. The Second Pair, the Optic, arise from the posterior part of the optic thalarai, and also from the tubercula quadrigemina ; they make a circle round the crura cerebri called the Tractus Opticus. The two nerves approach gradually, and unite, just before the pituitary gland, on the fore-part of tlie sella Tur- cica. 1 hey then diverge, and each nerve passes out at the foramen opticura of the sphenoid bone, to form the retina of the eye. On each side of these nerves are seen the Carotid Arteries. Each artery emerges from the cavernous smus by the side of the anterior clinoid process: sends a branch forwards, which, uniting with a simi- lar branch of the other carotid, forms the anterior part of the Circulus Arteriosus Willisii; wliile other branches, passing backwards, and uni- ting with branches of the basilar artery, complete the posterior part of the arterial circle. A fold of dura mater passes from the anterior t© the posterior clinoid process of each side. This fold is double, and forms by its duplicaturc the Caver- NOUSSINUS. On dividing the optic nerves, and inverting them, we see the iufuadibulum, a funnel of cineritious sub- 6tance»i Ul ) etance, leading from the inferior and anterior ex- tremity of tiic third ventricle to the pituitary gland ; it is generally imperforate before it reaches the gland. The Pituitary Gland, a reddish body some- what globular, consisting of two lobes, is situatedia the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone, partly co- vered by a fold of dura mater, and attached to the in- fundibulum. The circular sinus is situated at this point. On detaching the cerebrum from theback-part of the sella Turcica, the tunica arachnoides is very evident. 3. The Third Pair of Nerves, Motores OcuLORUM, arise from the crura cerebri *, pass out- wards and forwards on the outer side of the posterior clinoid process into the cavernous sinus, and run- through the foramen laccrum orbitale superius to the muscles of the eye. Between these two nerves are seen the two verte- bral arteries, ascending and unitisg, to form the ba- silary artery. 4. The Fourth Pair, Trochleares or Pa- THETici, are very slender, and situated immediately under the edge of the tentorium. 'J'his nerve arises from the valvula cerebri, comes out from betwixt the cerebrum and cerebellum, passes by the side of the pons Varolii, and, passing through the cavernous ^ sinus, continues its course through the foramen lace- rum orbitale superius, to supply the obliquus supe- rior muscle of tHe eye. * The two crura pass obliquely backwards and inwards, so as to converge and meet in front of the tuber annulare ; it is from the hollow formed by their convergejice, and named by Vicq d'Azyr, fosse des ncTfs oculo-musculaires that the third pair arise. 5 S. The( H2 }' 5. The Fifth Paik, Trigemini, are muck larger than the fourtli, and are situated more out- wards and backwards. Each of these nerves arises by a number of filaments, from the anterior and lowest part of the crus cerebelli, where tlie crus unites with the pons Varolii;—it passes forwards, enters the cavernous sinus, where it untwists itself, and forms a flat irregular ganglion, the Ganglion Gasserianum, and then divides into three great branches. (1.) Ramus Occularis.—The ophthalmic nerve of Willis passes through the foramen lacerum orbl- tale superius to the apendages of the eye. (2.) Ramus Maxillaris Superior passes through the foramen rotundum to the upper ja^y itnd face. (3.) Ramus Maxillaris Ikferior passes through the foramen ovale to the lower jaw and tongue. 6. The Sixth Pair, Motores Oculorum Ex- terni, or abductores.—This nerve is small, bub riot so small as the fourth pair ; it is seen arising betwixt the pons Varolii and corpora p3'ramidalia: it enters the cavernous sinus,—it there runs by the side of the carotid artery, and passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale superius to the rectus ex- ternus oculi. While in the cavernous sinus, it gives off the small twig, which, uniting with filaments from the second branch of the fifth pair, forms the beginning ©f the intercostal nerve, and passes out of the cra- nium through the foramen caroticuni with the caro- fcid artery. 1. TIi«,( 115 ) J 7. The Seventh Pa in, Nervi Aubitorii, consists of two portions. (].) Tiie Fortio Dura or tlio facial nerve, arises from the crus cerebclli, and conies out from the fossa or i^roove betwixt the pons Varohi, corpora olivaria, and crura cercbelli. ('2.) The Fortio Mollis, or more properly the audi- tory nerve, arises from the inner surface of the fourth ventricle ; it has a groove on its surface for receiving the portio dura; accompanied by an artery, they enter the meatus auditorius intern us, where the por- tio mollis is distributed to the parts of the internal ear, while the portio dura runs through the aqueduct of Failopius, and comes out at the stylo-mastoid foramen below the ear, to form the principal nerve of the face. 8. The Eighth Pair, Par Vagum, arises by numerous filaments from the sides of the corpora olivaria and medulla oblongata. Two distinct fasci- culi are formed, the uppermost called nervus glosso- pharyngeus, the other the proper par vagum;—they unite, run towards the foramen lacerura in basi cranii, pierce the dura mater, and pass out through the anterior part of the hole, having been first joined by the Nervus Accessorius ad Par Vagum, which runs up from the medulla gpinalis through the great occipital foramen. The great Lateral Sinus passes out by the back-part of the same foramen, to form the internal jugular vein ; it is separated from the nerve by a sJip ox cartilage. 9. The( 144 ) 9. The Ninth Pair, Linouales, Lingualei; Medii, Hypoglossi.—This nerve arises from the fur- row betwixt the corpora olivaria and pyraniidalia, by several filaments, which often pierce the dura mater separately. It passes through the anterior condy- loid hole of the occipital bone, to supply the muscles of the tongue. Immediately after leaving the cranium, the eighth and ninth pair, and the ganglion of the intercostal, are connected together. 10. The Tenth Pair *, Suboccipitales, arise, on each side, by two bundles, from the extremity of the medulla oblongata, and upper part of the spinal marrow, pass through the dura mater by the same foramen which gives entrance to the vertebral ar-ter}', and run through the foramen magnum occipitale to the muscles at the base of the cranium. The corpora albicantia Willisii, are again seen, two ■white bodies, on the base of the brain, behind the infundibulum, and above the pons Varolii. The Medulla Oblokgata remains to be de- monstrated. It should be removed from the bone, and examined in an inverted position. On its under surface are seen the two vertebral arteries, ascending from the foramen magnum, and uniting, to form one trunk, the basilar artery. Ou removing the pia mater, the whole surface appears medullary; but an incision shows it to be intermixed with the cineritious substance. The Crura or Pedukculi Cerebri, are tw» • These nre hgw perhaps at frcq«ehtlj described as the ttit pair of eervical nerves. considerable( H.5 ) I consulerable inctlullary fasciculi, proceeding from the centre of the medulla of the brain, more imme- diately from the corpora striata; they unite at an acute angle, and are united to the pons Varolii *. The Crura or Pedunculi Cerebblli are very large, and pass from the medullary part of the cere- bellum which forms the arbor vitae to the pons Va- rolii. The Pons Varolii, Tuber Annulare, or Nodus Cerebri, is a medullary protuberance, formed by the union of the crura cerebri and cerebelli, over which it is stretched hke a bridge; on its surface is a raphe, or transverse fibres passing into a middle longitudinal narrow depression. Below the pons Varolii, and separated from it bjr a sulcus, are seen four eminences : 1. The two external are named Corpora Oli- VARIA, 2. The two internal are named Corpora Pyra- MiDALiA, and, by separating these two bodies, me- dullary cords, passing transversely, appear, the nervi intercerebrales. The point of union betwixt the corpora pyrami- dalia and pons Varolii, is sometimes called foramen caecum. The medulla oblongata now contracts itself, and^ passing through the foramen magnum o.ccipitaJe,. assumes the name of * On making a section of (he crura cerebri, near to their union with the pons Varolii, a portion of a dark-brown colour, surrouiidi d witli white medullar^ sub«lance, is ieen, termed Ldcus A'iger Crurum Cerebri,( 146 ) Medulla Spinalis, or the Spinal Marrow This part of the nervous or sensorial system must be here described, although its dissection cannot be performed till all the muscles of the back are re- moved, so that the posterior part of the spinal canal may be sawed off. The spinal canal is lined by a strong ligamentous sheath, and the dura mater is continued down upon this sheath in the form of a funnel. The spinal marrow consists externally of medullary substance, internally of cineritious. It runs down to the first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates by nu- merous filaments, which form the cauda equina.—It is closely embraced by the pia mater, while the tu- nica arachnoides adheres to that membrane very loosely. During the whole of its passage, there is on each side a membranous connection betwixt the pia and dura mater, by distinct slips, irregular and pointed, which connection is named Ligamentu.m Denticul atum. The arteries of the medulla may be seen running down on its anterior and posterior surfaces ; they are branches of the vertebral arter}'. The spinal accessory nerve is seen arising b}'small twigs from the posterior bundles of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves ; it then ascends along the spinal canal, enters the foramen, and passes forwards, to accompany the par vagum. The spinal marrow sends off twenty-nine pair of spinal nerves, which pass through the foramina formed betwixt the bodies of the vertebra?. They consist of seven cervical, twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and five sacral pairs of nerves.' Eacii of these nerves arise*( m ) arises In two fasciculi, one from the fore-part, the other from the back-part, of the spinal marrow; these fascicuH penetrate the dura mater separately ; the posterior bundle forms a ganglion, and afterwards unites with the anterior fasciculus, to form the nerve. A general view of the distribution of the spinal nerves may be usefully subjoined in this place, to complete the description of the nerves. 1. The Cervical Nerves consist of seven pairs; they spread their branches over the side of the neck, and to the muscles moving the head and shoulders. The superior nerves send branches to the side of the head, and the inferior to the upper part of the chest and back. They also communicate freely with each other, and with all the neighbouring nerves;—high in the neck, and under the jaw, with the portio dura of the seventh pair, with the fifth, eighth, and ninth, pairs, and with the great sympathetic;—towards the middle of the neck, with the descendens noni, the sympathetic and eighth pair, and in the lower part of the neck with the sympathetic. The Phrenic Nerve is formed b}'- branches of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, passes obliquely down the neck through the thorax, then on each side of the pericardium, and is distributed to the diaphragm. The Axillary Plexus is formed by the princi- pal parts of the trunks of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical, and first dorsal nerves. 2. The Dorsal Nerves are twelve pairs.—They arise from the spinal marrow in the same manner as the cervical. Each nerve emerges betwixt the heads G 2 of \f 148 ) of the ribs, gives twigs to the great sympathetif nerve, and twigs which pierce backwards to the' muscles of the back ; then, entering the groove ia the lower edge of each rib, it accompanies the inter- costal artery, and runs towards the anterior part of the thorax, supplying the great muscles of the chest, giving twigs to the diaphragm,: and muscles of the abdomen; 3. The Lumbar Nerves are five pairs.—They arise in the same manner ; their trunks are coverod. by the psoas magnus muscle. Each nerve gives twigs to the muscles of the loins and back, and to the sym- pathetic nerves, and runs obliquely downwards to S'lpply the abdominal muscles and integuments of the groin and scrotum; but the trunks of tliese nerves assist in forming the nerves of the thigh. 4. The Sacral Nerves are five on each side, arising from the cauda equina. They come out through the anterior foramina, and send small branches to the neighbouring parts; but the great trunks of these nerves are united witli the lumbar serves, to form the nerves of the lower extremity, viz. (1.) The Anterior Crural Nerve, passing «ut under Poupart's ligament to the extensor mus- cles of the leg, is formed by branches of the first, «econd, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. (2.) The Obturator Nk.rve, leaving the pelvis by the thyroid holes, and being distributed to the deep-seated muscles on the inside of the thigh,, arises from branches of the second, third", and fourth iumbar nerves. (3.) The IsciiiATic or Sciatic Nerve, the greatesfc( 11.9 ) greatest nerve of the body, passes out from fhchac'k part of the pelvis, through the sacro-sciatic in)tchj, and takes its course along the back of the thigli, to supply the thigh, leg, and foot; it is formed from the two hist nerves of the loins and three first of the sacrum. All these nerves of the spine connnunicate freely by numerous twigs, and by the intervention of The Great Svimpathetic Nerve, or Inter- costal.—This nerve, origmally derived froni the sixth pair, and from some filaments of the fifth, passes out of the cranium with tlie carotid arterj'. It then descends through the neck, and forms three .ganglions in its course, which give cvvigs to the neigh- bouring parts, and are joined by filaments from the • cervical nerves, and the eighth and ninth pairs. The intercostal then enters the thorax, and descends by the side of the vertebrae, behind the pleura, giv- ing filaments, which, joining with twigs of the eighth pair, form several plexuses to supply the heart, lungs, &c. In the abdomen it descends on. the lumbar vertebrae, and at last terminates in the pelvis on the extremity of the coccyx. While in the thorax, it gives off a branch, which uniting with branches of the dorsal nerves, forms The Anterior Intercostal, or Splanchnic Nerve.—This nerve, passing betwixt the crura of the diaphragm, enters the abdomen, forms the semi- lunar ganglion, and is distributed by numerous plex- uses to all the abdominal viscera. The eighth pair, or par vagura, has also a very Jong course ; it arises in the head, passes through .g3 the( 150 ) the neck, to which it gives several branches. It enters the thorax anterior to the subclavian artery; here it gives off a remarkable branch, called the Recurrent, because it is reflected round the arch of the aorta on the left side, and round the subclaviaa artery on the right, and ascends to be distributed oa the trachea, oesophagus, and larynx. The nerve then passes through the thorax, and, entering the abdomen, terminates in the stomach ; in this course it has frequent communications with the great sym- pathetic, which it assists in forming the different plexuses that supply the thoracic and abdominal viscera. It is distributed to the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, and duodenum. or THE VESSELS OF THE BRAIN. The arteries ramify largely on the pia mater, be- fore they enter the substance of the brain; they •consc from two large branches. 1. The Internal Carotid Artery enters the skull by a winding course through the foramen caroticum of the temporal bone. After passing through the cavernous sinus, it divides into three branches: 1. Anterior cerebri, passing between the two anterior lobes ; 2. Media cerebri, entering the fissura sylvii; 3. Ramus communicans, uniting with the basilar. The carotid, while in the cavernous sinus gives of the arteria ophthaimica, which passes through the foramen opticura to the eye and its appendages. 2, The Vertebral Artery arises from the subclavian, ascends through the foramina in the transverse( 151 ) transverse processes of tlie cervical vcrtebrnc, enters the cranium by the foramen magnum, and gives branches to the dura mater and spinal marrow.— Uniting with its fellow, it forms the basilar artery, which Lfives branches to the internal" ear, branches to form the circulus arteriosus, and then divides into two large branches called Posteriores Ceuebri, which supply the back parts of the cerebrum. The Veins pour their blood into the sinuses, •which are numerous. None of these veins requjF5^*~~~- ^ I BORC particular attention, except the ophthalmic veipggjj^j- which passes through the foramen lacerum orbitaj^^"^—~ superius. The principal sinuses, viz. the longitudi-^i>^,p nal, the two lateral, the inferior longitudinal, have been described in the dissection of the brain. The remainder of these sinuses are situated in folds of the dura mater, but are not regular in their situa- tion. They transmit their blood to the longitudinal and lateral sinuses, which termiaate in forming the internal jugular veins. o CHAP.( ■) CHAP. VIT. DISSECTION OF THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE NECK. SECT. I. OF THE MUSCLES. ^J'H"E Utility of this dissection must be evident, when you consider how many important parts are contained in the forepart of the neck. The tuba which conveys air to the lungs, the vessels wliich are sent from the heart to the brain, and the nerves which are destined to supply the thoracic and abdo- minal viscera, are situated in the neck ; and all these parts lie imbedded iu cellular substance; hence the dissection is intricate, and requires the utmost care in its performance. The muscles of the anterior part of the neck, are g'Xteen in number on each side. They may be di- vided into muscles situated superficially, muscles at the upper part of the neck, and those situated at the lower part. The superficial muscles are two. .Imme-I 153 ) Immediately under the integuments, and auhcring' !\o them, 1, The Muscutus Cutaneus, vulgo, PJatysma myoides.—-It arisa; by slender separate fleshy fibn sj fi-om the cellular substance, covering the upper part of the deltoid and pectoral muscles. These fibres form a thin broad muscle, -which runs obliquely up- wards, and is Inserted into the skin and muscles covering the lower jaw and cheek, his muscle should be dis- sected in the course of its fibres; the skin, there- fore, must be dissected off in an oblique direction from "the clavicle to the chin. . Use : To draw the skin of the cheek downwards, and, Avhen the mouth is shut, to draw the skin under the lower jaw upwards. Synonyma : Quadratus gense;—Lattissimus colli; —Thoraco-maxilli-facial. Remove the platysma myoides from its origin, and invert it over the face. Immediately beneath it is seen the external jugular vein, which is formed of branches from the temple, side of the face, a:nd throat. It crosses obliquely over the sterno-mastoi- deus, passes behind the outer edge of that muscle, and dives beneath the clavicle, to enter the subcla- vian vein. 2. The Sterno-Cleido-Mastoideus—Arises^ by two distinct origins ; the anterior, tendinous and fieshy, and somewhat round, from the top of the sternum, near its junction with the clavicle; the ^posterior or outer, fleshy and flat, from the upper G,.5 .md( 154 ) and anterior part of the clavicle. These two origins soon unite, and form a strong muscle, which ascends obliquely upwards and outwards, to be Inserted, tendinous, into the outside of the mas- toid process, and into the transverse ridge behind that process. Use : When one acts singly, it turns the head to one side. When both act together, they bend the head forwards. Synonyina : Sterno-mastoideus et cleido-mastoi- deus ;—Mastoideus;—S'terno-clavio mastoidien. The muscle should be detached from the sternum and clavicle, and left suspended by its insertion. It is pierced by several branches of the cervical ner\'es,. and, about its middle, it is perforated by the Nervus Accessorius. These nerves ramify on the neighbour- ing muscles of the neck and shoulder. Between the posterior edge of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus and the fore-part of the trapezius muscles, is seen a quan- tity of loose fatty substance, iiitermixed with branches of nerves^ This fatty substance is watery and granu- lated ; it must not be removed roughly', lest import- aot nerves and vessels be injured; it is continued around the vessels under the clavicle. In the middle of the throat you see, (1.) The Os Hyoides, or bone of the tongue, farming the uppermost of tlie projections beneatb the chin. (2..) The Larynx, or upper part of the trachea, consisting of five cartilages, of which two are evident «xtetually, viz» 1. The uppermost aad largest is the thyroid{ 1J5 ) thyroul carti'bge ; 2. the inf erior is the cricoid carti- lage. Tlie tu-o arytenoid cartilages, and the epiglot- tis, lie behind (his. (3.) The Trachea, consisting of cartilaginous rings, and extending into the thorax. (i:) Behind the larynx is situated the pharynx; At the part where the larynx terminates in the tra. chea, the pharynx contracts itself, and forms the cesophagus, or muscular tube, conveying the food to the stomach, which descends behind the trachea, situated rather to the left side of the cervical ver- tebrae. Tliese parts are covered by muscles, and on each side of the trachea lie the great vessels and nerves. Musples at the lower part of the neck are five. 3. The SxERNo-HyoiDEUs—Arises, thin and fleshy, from the upper and inner part of the ster- jium, clavicle, and first rib :—It forms a flat narrow muscle. Inserted into the base of the os hyoides.

Situation : Beneath the sterno-hyoideus. Use: To draw the thyroid cartilage, and conse- quently the larynx, downwards. Synonyma : Sterno-thyroidien. Under the stemo-thyroideus, we find situated the Thyroid Gland, a large reddish mass, situated on the superior rings of the trachea, below the cri- coid cartilage; in form somewhat like a crescent, -with the cornua turned upwards. 6. The Thyro-Hyoideus—Arises, fleshy, from the tipper surface of the oblique ridge in the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and passes upwards, to be Inserted into part of the base, and almost all the • «ornu of the os hyoides.

Situation : - On the side of the laryox, and under the sterno-thyroideus. Use : To pull forwards, and depress the thyroid, or to elevate and draw backwards the cricoid car- tilage. Synonyma : Cfico-thyroidien. The muscles at the upper part of the neck consist of nine pair. 8. The DiGASTUicus—Arises, principally fleshy, from the fossa at the root of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; its fleshy belly terminates in a strong round tendon, which runs downwards and for- wards, passes through the fleshy belly of the stylo- ■hyoideus, is hxed by strong ligamentous and tendi- •nous fibres to the os hyoideus, from which it receives an addition of fibres; it then becomes again fleshy, •and runs obliquely upwards, to be Inserted into a rough sinuosity on the anterior in- ; ferior edge of that part of the lower jaw called the ?Chin. Situation: Its posterior belly is covered by the sterno"( 158 ) Bterno-cleido-mastoideus; its anterior belly lies im- mediately under the skin and platysma myoides. Use: To open the mouth, by pulling the lower jaw downwards and backwards; and, when the jaws are shut, to raise the larynx, and consequently the phar3-nx upwards, as in deglutition. Synonyma ; Biventer-maxillEC ;—Mastoidi-hyoge- nien. In the triangular space formed by the two bellies of this muscle, and the base of the lower jaw, lies the Submaxillary Gland. It lies upon a fiat muscle, the raylo-hyoideus, which is seen between the two bellies of the digastricus; the gland is sur- rounded by little absorbent glands. 9. The Stylo-Hyoideus—Arises, tendinous, from the middle and inferior part of the styloid pro- cess of the temporal bone; its fleshy belly is gene- rally perforated by the digastricus. Inserted, tendinous, into the os hyoides at the juncture of its base and cornu. Situation: The origin of this mucle is situated more inwards than the last, and nearer the base of the cranium ; it is the most superficial of three mus- cles which arise from the styloid process; sometimes it is accompanied by another small muscle, having the fame origin and insertion, the stylo-hyoides alter. Use: To pull the os-hyoides to one side, and a little upwards. Synonyma : Stylo-hyoidier». 10. The Stylo-Glossus—Arises, tendinous anc? fieBhy,froia the styloid process, and from a ligament( 159 ) that connects that process to the angle of the lower jaw. It descends, and becomes broader, but les» thick. Inserted into the root of the tongue, runs along its side, and is insensibly lost near its tip. Situation: This muscle lies within and rather above the stylo-hyoideus; underneath it is a ligament, extending from the styloid process to the angle of the OS hyoides.—Ligamentous fibres are also seen passing from that process to the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. Use: To move the tongue laterally and back- wards. 11. The Stylo-Piiaryngeus—Arises, fleshy from the root and inner part of the styloid process. Inserted into the side of the pharynx and back- part of the thyroid cartilage. Situation : It is situated deeper, and behind the jtylo-glossus. Use: To dilate and raise the pharynx and thyroid cartilage upwards. Synonyma: Stylo-thyro-pharyngien. On removing the submaxillary glands, and detach- ing the digiistric muscle from the os hyoides and chin, we expose the next muscle. 12. The Mylo^Hyoiorus—Arises, fleshy frota all the inside of the lower jaw,, between the last dcn& niolaris and the middle of the chin; the fibres fornx a flat muscle, converge, and are Inserted into the lower edge of the base of the os- byoides. Situation; Tills muscle unites with its fellow in tt middle( 160 ') "middle tendinous line which extends from the os hy- loides to the chin ; its posterior part is lined by the internal meaibrane of the mouth; it lies under the idigastricus, but is seen betwixt its bellies. Use: To pull the os hjoidcs forwards, upwards, and to either side. Synonyma : Mylo-hyoidien. The submaxillary gland sends off a duct, which passes behind the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoi- deus, and runs along the inner surface of this mus- cle forwards and upwards, on the inside of the sub- lingual gland, to open into the mouth on the side of the frenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Gland lies immediately above the mylo-hyoideu9, betwixt it and the internal mem- brane of the mouth, Tfrhere it lines the side and in- ferior surface of the tongue. It sends off several 'ducts, which open into the mouth between the root of the tongue and side of the lower jaw. The removal of the mylo-hyoideus exposes a pair ■ of muscles, which are closely atfaclied to one ano- ther. IS.

Use: To contract the substance of the tongue, and bring it backwards. - SECT. II. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES SEEN IN THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. ARTERIES. The carotid artery ascends from the thorax by the side of the trachea; on its outer side it has the internal jugular vein, and behind it the prir vagum and intercostal nerves. All these parts are con- nected and inclosed b}' condensed cellular mem- brane, which forms a kind of sheath for containing them. At the bottom, and in the middle of the neck, the carotid is covered by the sterno-cleido- mastoideus ; at the upper part, by adipose mem- brane, absorbent glands, and by the platysma myoides. It lies deep on the muscles of the spine, and gives off no branches, until it reaches the space between the larynx and angle of the jaw, just below the cornu of the os hyoides, where it divides into the external and internal carotids. Of the two, the internal carotid is situated most outwardly; it passes deep to the base of the cra- nium, where it enters the foramen caroticum, to supply the brain. The( 1(33 ) The external carotid immediately begins to Bend off branches. Anteriorly it sends off, 1. Tlie A. Thyroiuea Superior.—This artery passes downwards and forwards, to ramify on the thyroid gland, where it inosculates with the artery of the other side, and with the inferior thyroid ar- teries. In this course, it sends ramifications to the integuments, the outside of the larynx, the muscles &c. and one remarkable branch, the A.Lahyngea, which sometimes arises from the trunk of the exter- nal carotid; it is a small artery which divides betwixt the OS hyoides and thyroides cartilages, to supply the internal parts of the larynx. 2. A. Lingua LIS, vel Ranina—The sublingual artery passes over (he cornu of the os hyoides, then behind the inylo-hyoideus, over the stylo-glosius, hyo-glossus, and genio-hyo-glossus, to which it gives branches, and terminates in running along the infe- rior part of the tongue from its base to its apex. It gives branches, to the muscles about the chin, and to the substance and back-part of the tongue. 3. A. Maxillaris Externa.—The external maxillary artery passes under the stylo-hyoideus and posterior belly of the digastricus, then buries itself vmder the submaxillary gland. It runs over the lower jaw before the anterior edge of the masseter muscle, to supply the face. In its passage, it gives off numerous branches.— One is worthy of notice, which runs along under the line of the lower jaw, and passing over the jaw near t\\Q( 164- ) ■fixe symphysis, supplies the chin. Other twigs sup- •,ply the submaxillary gland, &c. Posteriorly the carotid sends off, 4. A. Occipitalis.—The occipital artery crosses backwards and upwards, over the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery, under the belly of the digastric muscle : it passes through a slight groove in the mastoid process below its great fossa, and ramifies on the back-part of the head. A re- markable branch of the occipital passes towards the base of the skull, to inosculate near the foramen magnum occipitis, with branches from the vertebral and posterior cervical arteries. 5. A. Pharyngea is a small branch of the caro- tid, which passes inwards to the pharynx and'base of the skull. 6. Posterior Auris, which passes backwards and upwards in the fold, between the ear and scalp, and is distributed on the integuments of the head. The external carotid ascends behind the angle of the jaw, and enters the parotid gland, where it di- vides into, 7. A. Maxillaris'Externa. '-8. A. Tp:mporalis. •9. A. Transveusalis Faciei. These arteries will be described in the dissection of the face. VEINS. The Internal Jugular Vein is a continua- ifran of the lateral sicus which passes through the foramea^ r 165 ) foramen lacerum in the base of the cranium. It comes out deep from under the angle of the jaw, and in its course do^vn the neck, it runs on tlie outw side of the carotid artery, before it reaches the thorax ; it passes rather more forwards than the artery, to join the subclavian vein. Its branches accompany the ramifications of the external carotid. At first the vein which accompa- nies each artery is a single branch, but it soon sub- divides, so that two veins accompany one artery. NERVES.. I. The Eighth Pair, or Par Vagum.—On se- parating the internal jugular vein, and trunk of the carotid artery, the par vagum is seen lying in the same sheath of cellular substance with those vessels. It lies in the triangular space formed betwixt the back-part of the artery and vein, and the subjacent muscles. This nerve comes out of the foramen lace- rum with the jugular vcm ; hence it adheres to that vein more closely than to the artery or muscles; it- runs down the neck behind these vessels. In this course it gives off several nerves. (1.) At the base of the cranium, it sends off seve- ral filaments, which are connected with the other nerves coming out of the base of the skull, such as the ninth pair, the superior cervical ganglion of the intercostal, &c. (2.) Nervus Glosso-Pharyngeus is sent off from the eighth pair, deep under the angle of the jaw. It passes behind the carotids towards the mus- cles( 166 ) cles arising from the styloid process; one principal branch of it passes between tlie st ylo-pliaryngeus and stylo-glossus to the tongue, while other twigs run behind the stylo-pharyngeus, to supply the pharynx. (3.) Nervus Laryngeus Superior, vel In- ternus.—The superior or internal laryngeal nerve passes behind the internal carotid artery, obliquely, downwards and forwards; then, under the hyo-thy- roideus muscle, it plunges betwixt the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage, accompanying the laryngeal artery, and supplying the internal parts of the larynx. (4;.) In the neck, also, the par vagum gives off filaments to the cervical ganglions of the intercostal nerve, and to communicate with the other nerves of the neck. Filaments also unite with twigs of the in- tercostal, and run down over the carotid artery to the great vessels of the heart, where they form the supe- rior cardiac plexus. The par vagum enters the thorax by passing be- twixt the subclavian artery and vein. 2. The Intercostal, or Great Sympathetic Nerve.—This nerve lies behind the carotid, in the cellular membrane, betwixt that vessel and the mus- cles covering the vertebr£E of the neck. It is distin- guished from the par vagum by being smaller, lying nearer the trachea, and adliering to the muscles of the spine ; also by its forming several ganglions. It arises from the sixth pair in the cranium, and comes eut by the same foramen as the carotid artery. Immediately after its exit from the skull, it forms the Superior Cervical Ganglion, which is very long, and of a reddish colour. The nerve afterwards 1 becomes( 167 ) becomes smaller, and descends; and opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, it forms another swel- ling', the Infekiou Cervical Ganglion. Sometimes it has another ganglion about the fourth •r fiftl) vertebra of the neck, the Middle Cervical Ganglion : but this is not a constant appearance. The nerve then passes behind the subclavian artery into the thorax. The branches of llie intercostal nerve are nume- rous, and they generally pass off from the ganglions. Immediately below the base of the cranium, twigs go to the eighth and ninth pairs, and to the upper cervical nerves. In the middle of the neck, some twigs pass over the carotid ; others go to the parts covering the trachea, and uniting with filaments of the par vagum, form the external laryngeal nerves ; others unite with the descendens noni, or descend- ing branch of the ninth pair, and some filaments as- sist the twigs of the par vagum to form the superior cardiac nerve. In the lower part of the neck, twigs are sent to communicate with the cervical nerves, &c. 3. The Ninth Pair, Nervus Hj^po-glossus, or Lingual nerve, having left the skull by the anterior condyloid foramen, is connected with the eighth pair and intercostal nerve. Like them, it lies deep, and comes out from under the angle of the jaw. It is seen passing from behind the internal jugular vein, and then over the carotid artery, running betwixt these tvvo vessels. It next passes under the mylo- hyoideus, running over the stylo-glossus, hyo-glos- sus, and genio-hyo-glossus, which last muscle its jiumerous branches perforate. Branches.( 1G8 ) Branches.—While the nerve is passing betwixC the jugular vein and the carotid artery, it sends oiTthe Descendens Noni.—This small and delicate nerve descends on the fore-part of the vein and artery, and is distributed to the muscles on the anterior part of the trachea. It is joined by filaments of the cervical nerves. 4. The Lingual Branch sent off by the third bi-anch of the fifth pair of nerves, is also seen in the dissection of the neck. It is found under the mylo- hyoideus; it lies close upon the lower edge of the jaw-bone, betwixt the inferior edge of the pterygoi- deus internus and the upper part of the mylo-hyoi- deus. It gives numerous twigs to the sublingual gland and submaxillary duct, which are situated near it, and is lost in the substance of the tongue. 5. Nervus Accessorius ad par Vagum.—The accessory nerve, having passed out of the cranium with the parvaginum, separates from it, passesbehind the internal jugular vein obliquely downwards and backward; it perforates the mastoid muscle, and is distributed to the trapezius and muscles about the shoulder; it is much connected with the third and fourth cervical nerves. 6. The Seven Cervical Nerves come out from the foramina betwixt the vertebrse of the neck. They send numerous branches to the muscles, &c. on the side of the neck, and communicate by filaments with all the other nerves in the neck. In this stage of the dissection, we may also see, 7. The Phrenic Nerve, formed by branches •f the third and fourth cervical nerves.—This small nerve( 1G9 ) •»erve lies upon the belly of the anterior scalenui nmscic, and dives into the thorax, betwixt the sub- clavian artery and vein. 8. The Recurrent Nekve, a branch sent off from the par vagtim in the thorax, is also seen in the neck. Dissect between the under surface of the tra- chea and oesophagus at the lower part of the Jieck, and you will find the recurrent nerve situated there. 9. The upper part of the Great Brachiai. Plexus may be seen, arising on the side of the neck, from tlie lower cervical nerves, and passing; Weliind the anterior scalenus, to reach the arm. CHAP. VIII. DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. SECT. I. THE MUSCLES WHICH LIE UPON THE OUTSIDE OF THE THORAX. *JN removing the integuments from the fore-part of the thorax, the pectoralis major and interior edge of the deltoid muscle should be dissected in thecourse of their fibres; and to do this, it will be necessary to remember that the fibres run obliquely from the ster.( no ) ircim and clavicle to the upper part of the os humeri**- They are not covered by any fascia, but by a con- densed cellular membrane, which is similar to a thin aponeurosis, and is vtith difficulty dissected away, unless it be done very regularly. Three pair of muscles are described in this dissec- ^on. L The Pectorat.is Major—Arises, tendinous, from the anterior surface of the sternum, its whole length ; fleshy, from the cartilages of the filth, sixth^ and sometimes the seventh ribs, and from two an- terior thirds of the clavicle. The fleshy fibres run obliquely across the breast, and, converging, form a Strong flat tendon, which is Inserted into the ridge of the .os brachii on the «utside of the groove for the long tendon of the Biceps flexor cubitii Situation ; Th« belly of tliis muscle is superficial^ It is separated from the deltoid muscle by cellular membrane and fat, by the cephalic vein, and a small artery, named A. Thoracica Humeraria. Its tendi- nous fibres, arising from the sternum, are interlaced with those of the opposite, so as to form a kind of fascia covering the bone; and the origins from the ribs are intermixed with the obliquus externus abdo- minis. The clavicular and thoracic portions of the muscle are separated by a line of cellular membrane. The tendon is covered by the anterior edge of tlie deltoid; it forms the anterior fold of the arm-pit, and- appears twisted, for the fibres which proceed from tli* * Called also Os Bracliii. thcfrackr( rn ) - iifioracic portion of tlie muscle, seem to pass behind liehoseproceedingfromthe clavicle, and to be inserted ianto the os humeri somewhat higher up. Use: To move the arm forwards, and obliquely Bupwards, towards the sternum. Si/nonyma : Pectoralis ;—Sterno-costo-clavlo-hu- HHieral. The pectoralis mtijor should be lifted up from its oorigin, and suspended by its tendon.—This will ex- «pose the next two muscles. 2. The Pectoralis Minor—Arises, by three (tendinous and fleshy digitations, from the upper (.edges of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, near their ccartilages ; it forms a fleshy triangular belly, which bbecomes thicker and narrower as it ascends, and is Inserted, by a short flat tendon, into the anterior ppart of the coracoid process of the scapuW Situation : The belly of this muscle is covered by i'the pectoralis major : the tendon passes under the aanterior edg.e of the deltoid, and is connected at its uinsertion with the origins of the coraco-brachialis, land of the short head of the biceps flexor cubiti, and aalso with the ligamentum proprium scapulce anticura^ aa strong ligament, which passes from the external eedge of the coracoid process, tu be affixed to the pposterior margin of the acromion of the scapula. Use: To draw the scapula forwards and down- wards, and, when that bone is fixed, to elevate the 'ribs. Sijnonyma : Serratus anticus;—Serratus minoraa- :ticus;—Costo-coracoidien. 2. The SuBCLAvius—Arises, by a flat tendon, H 2 froitt7 the ( 1*72 ) from the cartilage of the first rib, and forms a broad fleshy belly, which is Inserted, into the inferior surface of the clavicle, beginning about one inch from the sternum, and continuing as far as the ligamentous connection of the clavicle to the coracoid process. Situation: This muscle is situated between the €lavicle and sternum, concealed by the pectoralis major, and alterior part of the deltoides. Use : To draw the clavicle downwards and for- wards, and perhaps to elevate the first rib. Synonyma: Costo-claviculaire. Having lifted up the pectoralis minor from its ori- gin, the situation of the subclavian vessels which pass under the clavicle, and over the first rib, may i5e seen, (See the dissection of the Axilla.) SECT. II. ■©F THE PARTS CONTAINED WITHIN Tin:. CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The cavity of the thorax may now be opened, by- cutting through the cartilages of the ribs on each side and separating the lower part of the sternum from the diaphragm. That bone must then be lifted upwards, and the first and second parts of which it is composed divided by an incision along the inner surface of their junction; or the whole sternum may be removed, by separating it at its articulations with< 173 ) ttiio clavicle. The latter method is preferable, as ie sallows lis to examine move readily the great vesselg (passing out of the thorax. On looking under the sternum, while it is lifted I up, we seethe Mediastinum, separating, as it isgra- i dually torn from the posterior surface of the sternum, iinto two layers, and thus forming a triangular cavity. ' This cavity is artificially produced, and is entirely (Owing to the method of raising the sternum. Whea the sternum is laid back or removed, the I following parts are to be observed: The MediaSTIMUM, now collapsed, dividing tthe thorax into two distinct cavities, of which the I tight is the largest. • The lungs of each side lying distinct in these I cavities. The pericardium, containing the heart, situated in ■ the middle of the thorax, between the two lamina of • the mediastinum, and protruding into the left side. The internal surface of the pleura, smooth, co- ; lourless, and glistening, lining the ribs, and reflected ■ over the luugs. 1. The Pleuha.—Each side of the thorax has ita^ particular pleura:—The pleurce are like two blad- ders, situated laterally with respect to each other; by adhering together in the middle of the thorax, and. passing obliquely* from the posterior surface of thti * Tlicy run obliquely, not being in general atlaclied to the middle of the sternum, but towards its lelt side, especially at the lower part of ihe bone, near ihe diaphragm. Besides the jjcncardiuiii, ihe mediasiinuni contains betwytt i^8 lannnie some adipose nicoibraneand absorbent gland*. u $ Sternum-•sternum to the dorsal verteLra;, they form tlie me- diastinum.—The pleura lines the ribs, and the upper surface of the diaphragm, and is reflected over the lung, which is in fact behind it; it forms tlie liga- ■mentum hitum pulmonis, a reflection of this mem- brane, which connects the inferior edge of the lungs to the ?pine and diaphragm. 2. The Lungs.—Co/our, reddish in Children, greyish in adults, and bluish in old age.—S/iape^ corresponding to that of the thorax, somewhat py- ramidal, convex towards the ribs, concave towards the diaphragm, and irregularly flatted uex-t the me- diastinum. Division (1.) The Right Lung is the largest, and is divided into three lobes, two greater ones, and aa intermediate lesser lobe. (2.) The Left Lung has two lobes, and also a square notch opposite the apex of the heart. Into the sulci or grooves which form the divisions of the lungs into lobes, the pleura enters; that part of the lung which is affixed to the spine, is called its root; it is the part by which the great vessels enter. . 3. The Pericardium is a strong, white, and compact membrane, smooth, and lubricated upon the inside, forming a bag for containing the heart, and having its inner lamina reflected over the sub- stance of the heart itself. 4. Wlien you slit open the fore-part of the peri- cardium, you expose the Heart. The right ven- tricle protrudes; the right auricle also is towards you ; while the left auricle is retired, and its tip is «een lapping round uj)on the left ventricle. From .uudejf( 175 ) under^he tip of the left auricle, a branch of tTie ca- ronary vein, and one of the coronary artery, ramify towards the apex of the heart, marking tlie situation of the septum cordis. The left ventricle will be found firm, fleshy, and resisting, whilst the right ventricle is more loose, and seems partly wrapt round the other. The heart is situated obliquely in the middle of the breast; its posterior surface is flat, and lies upon tlie diaphragm; its apex is turned forwards, and to- wards the left side, so, that, in the living body,-it is felt striking between the fifth and sixth ribs, at the point where the cartilages and bony extremities are -united. The Vena Cava Superiou is seen com- ing down from the upper angle of the pericardium. The Inferior Cava is seen coming up through the diaphragm; but only a very small part of this vein is covered by the pericardium ; the two veins enter the right auricle. The Right Auliicle is turned foi-- wards, and might be called the anterior; it generally appears black, by the blood shining through its thia coats. The Right Ventricle is situated almost directly opposite. The Pulmonary Artery iirisesfrom the right ventricle; its root is concealed by the right auricle; it ascends on the left side of the aorta; it divides into, 1. the right pulmonary arteryj which passes under the arch of the aorta, crosses be- hind it and the vena cava superior to the right lung, and is the longest; and, 2. the left pulmonary artery, which passes to the left lung, crossing the descend- ing aorta anteriorly. The Pulmonary Veins en- ier .the left auricle, two veins come from each lung ; ,U th«( 176 ) the right veins are longest as they pass behind the ▼ena cava superior. The left auricle is situated on the left side of the right auricle, and somewhat be- hind it; its tip is seen lapping round upon the Left Ventricle ; this is situated behind and on the left side of the right ventricle; its substance is stronger and more firm to the touch. The Aorta arises from, the back-part and right side of the left ventricle ; its root is covered by the pulmonary artery ; it then ascends betwixt that artei-y and the vena cava supe- rior. Immediately from the root of the aorta, withirv the pericardium, the two coronary arteries are sent- oS tQ supply the heart itself. SECT. III. DISSECTION OF THE GREAT TESSELS OF THE HEART. The Vena Cava Supeuior will be seen de- scending before the root of the lungs, and on the right side of the aorta. Immediately before perfo- rating the pericardium, it is joined upon its posterior part by the vena azygos, which comes forwards from the spine, returning the blood from the intercostal spaces. Behind the sternum, and just above the arch of the aorta, the superior cava is seen receivhig two great branches. 1, A branch coming fvcm the right sieie, formed( 177 ) by the right subc/avian vein, and the right internal juguhir. 2. A larger branch coming from tiie left side; it is formed by the left subclavian and left interna^ jugular, which unite to form a trunk. I'his trunk crosses before the arteries arising from the arch of tlie aorta, and then enters the superior vena cava. Into the posterior part of the angle formed by the union of the left subclavian and the left jugular, the. tlioracic duct empties itself. On each side, the internal jugular vein descends along the neck by the side of the carotid, while the subclavian vein comes from the arm. The Vena Cava Inferior, immediately after' passing through the diaphragm from the abdomeai enters the pericardium. The Aorta leaves the heart opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra -, it crosses over the pulmonary artery,, ascends obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the- right side, as high as the second dorsal vertebra. Plere it forms an Akch or incurvation, which passes from the right to the left side, and at the same time obliquely from before backwards ; it then comes in i contact with the upper part of the third dorsal ver- tebra, and descends along the spine in the posterior mediastinum. This arch of tiie aorta is situated behind the first bone of the sternum, behind and somewhat below the left branch of the vena cava superior. From the upper part of the arch come off three kirge arteries. 1. The Arteria Innominata, or common. H 5 trunjlfc.'( 178 ) ^trunk of the right carotid and subclavian, ascenSs ■above an inch, and bifurcates into, a, The right carotid, which ascends in the neck by the side of the trachea. The right subclavian, which passes outwards to -the arm. • 2. The left carotid. 3. The left subclavian comes oif from the extre- mity of the arch. The arch of the aorta also gives off some smal! twigs which pass to the pleura, the mediastinum, and thymus. The Thymus is a «oft glandular body, lying be- fore the lower part of the trachea and great vessels of the heart, a little higher than the tops of the two pleurse. -It is very large in the foetus, smaller in adults, and nearly disappears in the aged. Where the aorta begins to descend, it is connect- ed to the pulmonary artery by a ligament, which, in the foetus, was a lar^e canal, the Ductus Arte' BJOSUS. '^OtlKSE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY ON' EACH SIDE. The subclavian artery passes upwards and out- "Avards, runs under the clavicle, and over the middle of the first rib ; it passes between the beihes of the anterior and middle scaleni muscles, then runs under the arch of the pectoralis minor, and enters the axilla, where it assumes the name of Axillary Jirterj. -TJic( 179 ) The order in which the followhig arteries arc sent off from the subclavian varies much ; soinc'times tliey come ofl'singly, at other times in hirge trunks, which subdivide. Backwards the subclavian sends off, 1. The Vertebral Autehy.—This artery arises frora the back-part of the subclavian, passes out- wards and enters die foramen in the transverse pro- .cess of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends through the transverse processes of the vertebrae, to enter the foramen magnum of the occipital bone. 2. The Inferior Thyroid Artery ascends obliquely inwai'ds, passes behind the internal jugular vein to ramify on the thyroid gland, where it inos- culates largely with ,the superior thyroid arteries. Branches from this artery pass to the trachea and oesophagus, to the muscles of the neck, and of the scapula: one of these is the supra scapulary artery, (see the account of the branches of the axillary artery.) 3. A. Cervicalis Anterior, vd Profunda^ passes deep to the muscles situated on the fore-part -of the cervical vertebrae, and ascends as high as the base of the skulL 4-. A. Cervicaxjs Posterior, vel Superficia1is<, is larger than .the Jast; it ascends obliquely out- Wctrds, generally passes betwixt the transverse pro- cesses of the last ciervical and first dorsal vertebra2« ,and ascends on th-g'back-part of the neck, deeply seated; some of its branches pass down the back superficially. Anteriorly, the subclavian artery gives off, uG .5. A..J\jUm-( 18b ) 5. A. Mammaria Interna. The internal mani' niary arises from the fore-part of the subclavian opposite the cartilage of the first rib; it runs down on the inside of the cartilages of the ribs, and ter- minates in the abdominal muscles, where it inoscu- lates with the epigastric. It is a large artery, and its branches are very numerous. They pass to the external muscles of the chest, to the intercostal muscles, pleura, &c. It also sends off the Artekia Phrenica Superior, vel comes nervi phrenici, which, with two veins, accompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. 6. The subclavian artery gives twigs to the root of the neck, and to the muscles about the scapula. 7. A. Intercostalis Superior. Frequently a trunk^ comes off from the subclavian, especially on the right side, which passes downwards and back- wards, and lodges itself by the spine, to supply the two or tlii-ee superior intercostal spaces. COURSE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN VEIN. The subclavian vein is situated anteriorly to the subclavian artery; it passes inwards behind and un- ^er the subclavius muscle, and before and over the belly of the anterior scalenus, (so that this last mus- cle lies betwixt the vein and artery.) It runs over the first rib, from under the arch of the pectoralis iHinor, where it is found in contact with the axillary artery, and is called the Axillary Vein. The branches of this vein accompany and corre- spond to the ramifications of the subclavian artery, returning( 181 ) returning the blood troni the thyroid ghmd, neck chest, mtercostal spaces, &c. The subclavian vein also receives the internal jugular, which passes down behind the clavicle. THE COURSE OF TfJE BRACHIAL FLEXUS OF NERVES May also be examined. This plexus is formed by branches of the four lower cervical and first dorsid nerves, which pass between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles into the axilla. In this passage they are situated higher up than the arter}'. A considerable part of the scaleni muscles may BOW be seen; the upper insertion of these muscles must be dissected with the muscles of the back-part of the neck. 1. The Scalenus Anticus—Arises, by three tendons, from the transverse processes ckf the fourth,, fifth, and sixth vertebras of the neck. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the upper edge of the first rib, near its cartilage. Hynonyma: Scalenus prior;—First scalenus;—• Anterior portion of the first scalenus ;—Trachelo- costal. 2. The Scalenus Medius—Arises, tendinous, from the transverse processes of all the vertebrae of the neck. Inserted into the upper and outer part of the first rib, from its root to within the distance of half an inch from the scalenus anticus. Synonymai( 182 ) '^Sipionipna : Second Scalenus ;—posterior portion of the first scalenus ; Trachelo-costal. 3. The Scalenus Posticus—Arises, tendinous, from the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth vertebras of the neck. Inserted into the upper edge of the first rib, near the spine. Synonyma: Third scalenus ;—Scalenus secundus J —Trachelo-costal. Situation : These muscles are covered before by 4;he sterno-mastoideus and trapezius, behind by the trapezius and Javator scapulae; but the scaleni are so connected with the xnuscles of the spine, that the ivhole of them'cannot be demonstrated till the mus- cles of the back and neck are dissected. Use of these three muscles: To bend the neck to one side, and, when the muscles of both sides act to bend it forwards ; or, when the neck is fixed, to ele- svate the ribs, and .dilate the chest. SECT. IV. DISSECTION OF THE AXILI/Aj OR ARM-PIT, There is a considerable resemblance in the dis- rsectiou of the axilla to that of the ham or groin ; in . each of these situations we meet with important Jblood-vessels and nerves, closely connected together, embedded 4-'( 183 ) embedded in adipose membrane, and seated m llie flexure of a joint. The axilla is tbrmed by two muscular folds which bound a middle cavity. The anterior fold is formed by the pectoralis major passing from the thorax to the arm^ the posterior by tlie Jatissimus dorsi coining from the back. In the intermediate cavity there is a quantity of cellular membrane and absorbent glands, covering and connecting the great vessels and nerves. This ■cellular and adipose membrane is.continued from the interstice above the clavicle betwixt the edges of the trapezius and mastoid muscles. All the space before the root of the neck above the first rib, and under the clavicle and coracoid process of the scapula, and •the interstices of the muscles passing through that space, are filled up by a quantity of adipose mem- brane ; and this is not exactly similar to the fat in ■other parts of the body; it is more granulated, wa- ■tery, and of a reddish colour ; it surrounds the great •vessels and nerve, rendering, the dissection both te- dious and difficult. The Axillary Vein will be found lying ante- rior to the artery, that is,- nearer the integuments* Jt seems to be a continuation of the basilic vein, which runs along the inside of the arm quite super- ficial, and of the two or three venae satellites, or veins which accompany the brachial artery. The axillary veins receives branches corresponding to the -ramifications of the artery. Passing under the cla- vi'icle, it becomes the subclavian vein, and runs over the( 184 ) die first rib, and before the anterior scalenus muscle into the thorax. Deeper seated, and immediately behind the axil- lary vein, lies the Axillary Artery. . It is seen coming from under the clavicle; from under the arch formed by the pectoralis minor, it comes over the middle of the first rib, and between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles. In the axilla it is surrounded by the meshes of the nerves, and runs along the inferior edge of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; when it has passed the anterior edge of the pectoralis major,.it assumes tlie name of die Brachial Artery. The branches of the axillary artery are, 1.. A. Mammaria Externa, called also, A. Thoracicae Externae.—The external mammary artery consists of three or four branches which run down- wards and ftinvards obliquely over the chest. These branches sometimes come off separately from the axillary arterj^, at other times by one or two com- mon trunks, which subdivide. They supply the pectoral muscles and mamma. Some of their branches pass to the muscles of the shoulder, to the side of the chest, and to the muscles on the inside of the scapula. 2. A. ScAPULAKis Inteitna, Supra-scapularis 6r Dorsalis Scapula?, is sent off from the back-part of the axillary artiery. It runs across the bottom of the neck towards the root of the coracoid process, and passes through the semilunar notch in the superior eosta of the scapula; it supplies tjie tupra-spinatus muscle,f IS5 ) muscle, and then passes under the acromion, to ra- mify on the muscles below the spine of the sciipuiit. It is generally a branch of the A. Thyroidea Inferior, and is then named A. Transversahs Humeri. S. A. SCAPULARIS ExTEUNA, InFUASCAPULA- lus, or Thoracica Posterior, arises from the under and back part of the axillary artery, attaches itself to the inferior costa of the scapula, where it splits into two great branches: 1. A large branch, which passes to the outer surface of the scapula below tlie spine, and has its principal ramifications close upon the bone. 2. The other branch (which is larger) passes to the inner surface of the scapula, supplies the subscapularis, and sends branches downwards to the muscles of the back and loins. 4. AkTERIA ClRCUMFLEXA HuMEni POSTE- RIOR, Humeralis, or Reflexa-articularis, arises from the lower and fore part of the axillary artery, and runs backwards close to the bone, surrounds its neckj'and is lost on the inner surf ace of the deltoid ; it gives also twigs to the joint and neighbouring muscles. 5. A. CiRcuMFLEXA ANTERIOR is a much smaller artery, often a branch of the circumtlexa posterior ; it encircles the neck of the bone on, its fore part, and is lost on the inner surface of the deltoides, where it inosculates with the posterior circumflex artery. The Great Brachial Nerves accompany the subclavian artery over the first rib. In the axilla they are united by numerous cross branches, forming, the Axillary or Brachial Pkxis, which is continued; from( 186 ) from the clavicle as low as tbe edge of the tendon of ilie latissiiuus dorsi, and which surrounds the axil- lary artery with its meshes. From the axillary plexus seven nerves pass ofF. 1. NiiRvus SuPiiA-scAPULARis, Scapularis Ex- ternus, Scapularis.—This nerve comes off from the upper edge of the plexus : it crosses the axilla at the highest part, runs towards the superior costa of the scapula, accompanies the external scapular ar- tery through the semilunar notch, and supplies the muscles on the posterior surface of the scapula, 2. N. CiRCUMFLEXUSp Articularis, Axillaris, or Humeralis, lies deep: it passes from the back-part the plexus, goes backwards round the neck of the bone, accompanying the posterior circumflex artery, and is distributed to the musculus deltoides, •and the muscles on the outside of the arm. Small nerves also pass from the axillary plexus to the sub- scapular muscle, the teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoral muscles. 3. The External Cutaneous Nerve, or Nervus- Musculo-cutaneus. 4. The Radial Nerve, 5. The Ulnar Nerve, 6. The Muscular or Spiral Nerve, 7. The Internal Cutaneus Nerve. These five nerves will be described in the dissec- tion ef the arm and fore-arm. SECT«7 I «ECT. V. 'T>BSECTtON OF TflE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM*, AND 01-' THK NERVES AND VESSELS WHICH HAVE TIIEIIl COURSE THUOUGH THE THORAX. Course of the Phrenic Nerve through the thorax—On each side this nerve is seen entering the thorax betwixt the subclavian artery and subclavian vein; it then proceeds downwards and forwards before the root of the lungs, and on the outside of the pericardium, betwixt that bag and the pleura: it id lost on the diaphragm. The left phrenic nerve lias a somewhat longer course than the nerve of tJie right side, as it passes over tlie pericardium, where that bag covers the apex of the heart. This nerve is accompanied by one artery and two veins; some twigs pass from the phrenic nerve into the abdomen, to the liver, &c. Behind the arch of the aorta and great vessels passing from the heart, is seen the Trachea. It •enters the tliorax between the two pleurae, and, op- posite the third or fourth dorsal vertebra, bifurcates into two parts: one of which passes toward the right, the other toward the left,, to enter the lung of each side. By folding back the lungs towards the left side of .•the chest, we expose the pleura reflected from the * By Posterior Mediastinum is designed that part of the me. diaslinuni situated behind the root of the lungs. lunderi IS8 ) tinder surface of the root of the lungs to the spine and ribs. A triangular space is formed betwixt the two pleura and the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae; this space,or cavity is named the cavity of the pos- terior mediastinum. It contains many important parts, and must therefore be carefully dissected. But first let us attend to the course of the inter- costal, or great sympathetic nerve, which is seen running by the side of the spine. The Intercostal Nerve, where it enters tlie thorax, is situated behind the great vessels; close upon the articulation of the first rib with the body of the first dorsal vertebra, it forms a ganglion, a twig of which fairly encircles the subclavian artery^ while other filaments are entwisted round the root of the vertebral artery. The intercostal nerve than descends along the thorax ; it lies upon the heads of the i*ibs, where they arearticulated with the vertebrse; it receives additional branches from all the dorsal nerves, and in each intercostal space it forms a gang«- lion. This nerve may be dissected with greater fa- cility when the lungs are removed, and the ribs sawed. ©IF near the spine, which will enable the dissector to trace its branches more fully. It lies behind the pleura, but is seen through it; it passes into the ab- domen by the side of the spine, running through the fibres of the small muscle of the diaphragm. BRANCHES OF THE INTERCOSTAL IN TUB THORAX,. The A.NTERIOR Intercostal, or Splakcunic Nerve, should be attended to. It is formed by ihree or four tw igs, which come off from the inter- costakcostal betwixt the fourth and eighth dorsal ver- tebrae; these twigs, passing forwards on tlio bodies of the vertebrce unite to form the splanchnic nerve, which may be traced entering the abdo- men, betwixt the crura of the small muscle of the diaphragm. From tlie intercostal, also, tv/igs are given off, which assist the branches of the par vagum, and of the dorsal nerves, in forming several plexuses to sup- ply the viscera of the thorax. The right intercostal nerve lies under the pleura by the right side of the spine. Still nearer the mid- dle of the spine, you see the Vena Azygos. In dissecting, it is found situated betwixt the right intercostal nerve and the aorta ; ic begins below from raoiifications of the lumber arteries, which pierce the small muscle of the diaphragm. This vein ascends along the spine, receiving veins from each of the intercostal spaces of the right side, and, about the middle of the back, it receives a considerable trunk, ■Rrhich comes from,under the aorta, and returns the blood from the left side of the thorax. At the fourth dorsal vertebra, the vena azygos leaves the spine; it makes a curve forward, and empties its blood into the back-part of the vena cava superior, immediate- ly before that vein enters the pericardium. Descending through the posterior mediastinum, will be also found the Aorta. This great artery, having formed its arch, comes in contact with the tliird dorsal vertebra, and is now called the Descend- ing Aorta, or Thoracic Aorta. It descends along the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, rather on their left side;( 190 ) aide; it lies beliind the asopliagus, and passes be^ twixt the crura of the diaphragm into the abdomen ^ BRANCHES OV THE AORTA IN THE TIIOIIAX. 1. A. Intercostales Inferiores—The ar- teries which supply the three or four superior inter- costal spaces, generally come off in one comraoo' trunk, which afterwards subdivides. The Intercostalis Superior, on the right side, is- mostly sent off by the subclavian ; on the left side^ by the aorta. The Inferior Intercostals are eight or nine in number on eacb side of the thorax; they come off separately from the side or back-part of the aorta, and seem to tie that great artery to the spine. Each intercostal arter}' passes immediately into the interval betwixt two ribs, and there subdivides into, ( 1.) A branch which perforates between the heads^ of the ribs to the muscles of the back; this branch also gives twigs which enter the spinal canali (2.) The continued trunk of the artery runs for- wards, in the interval of the two ribs, giving many branches to the intercostal muscles. When it reaches the anterior part of the thorax, it is lost in the muscles. Each intercostal artery is aceompaniecl by one or two veins, branches of the vena azygos, and by an intercostal or dorsal nerve. 2. A. Bronchiales, are two, sometimes three, small twigs of the aorta, one of which passes to the kmgs on each side; they sometimes arise from the subclavian and superior intercostal. 3, Small arteries pass forwards from the aorta on. the( 191 ) the cesopliagus, named A. (Esopliageos; others ruit to the pericardium and pleura. The dissector also finds iu the posterior mediasti- num the TaoiiACic Duct. He must look Tor it behind the oesophagus, betwixt the vena azygos and aorta: it is collapsed, and appears like cellular mem- brane condensed, ami can only be distinguished when inflated or injected; it was seen in the abdomen close to the aorta,and passing into the thorax between ' the crura of the diaphragm. It ascends along the posterior mediastinum, and, about the fourth dorsal vertebra, passes obliquely to the left side, behind the aorta descendens, and behind the great arch of the •aorta, until it reaches the left carotid artery. It runs- behind this artery, and behind the left internal jugu- lar vein ; and, after forming a circular turn or arch^ (the convexity of which is turned upwards,) It de- scends and enters the left subclavian vein at the point where that vein is joined by the left Internal j'ugular. In its course along the spine, the thoracic duct frequently splits Into two branches, which re- unite. The absorbents of the right superior extrC' raity, and of the right side of the head and thorax, usually form a trunk, which enters the right sub- clavian vein. The CEsoPHAGUs is also situated betwixt the lay- ers of the posterior mediastinum. It lies immediately before the aorta, but rather towards its left side; iC is seen descending from the neck behind the trachea; it passes through an opening in the lesser muscle of the diaphragm, and immediately expands into the •teniach. Behind( 192 ) Behind the trachea and vessels going to the lungs, and on the fore-part of the oesophagus, we meet witk a congeries of lymphatic glands. COURSE OF THE PAR VAGUM,OR EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES, IN THE THORAX. From the neck, the par vagum passes betwixt the subclavian vein and artery into the thorax; it imme- diately sends off a large branch, the Recurrent Nerve, back into the neck. On the right side, this branch twists round under the arteria inno- minata; on the left side, under the arch of thft aorta, it ascends behind the carotid, and lodges it- self betwixt the trachea and oesophagus, to both of which it gives branches. The par vagum, having given off the recurrent, descends by the side of the trachea, and behind the root of the lungs. It here sends off numerous fila- ments to the lungs, which, uniting with twigs from the great sympathetic, form the Akterior and Posterior Pu:pmonary Plexuses; these plexuses lie on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the root of the lungs. Other twigs of the par vagum pass, to form the inferior Cardiac Plexus about the pericardium. The trunk of the eighth pair soon reaches the oeso- phagus; the left par vagum runs on the fore-part of the oesophagus, the right nerve on its back-part. Here they split into several branches, which unite again, and form a Plexus. This plexus is called the CEso- IHAGEAL. The two nervcs eoQtiau« their course alon^I left ( lO-J ) aloniT tlic rcsoplvagiis, anil pass with it through the diap!iraii;in, to ramify on tho stomach, antl tbi in the siomachic plexus. Tho tu-elve dorsal or intercostal nerves are also seen in this dissection, emerging from the spinal ciiniil, between the bodies of the vertebrae, and sup- plying the iritercostal muscles, &-c. SECT, VI, DISSECTION or THE HEART, WHEN REMOVED PROM THE BODY. The heart consists of three tunics or coats. 1. An external smooth one, which is a reflection of the internal lamina of the pericardium. 2. A middle muscular coat. 3. A smooth internal coat, Vi'hichis a continuation of the internal coat of the great veins and arteries. In the right side of the heart we al- ways meet with a considerable quantity of coagu- lated blood. In the left side, there is much less. Slit open, with the scissars, the two vena3 cavas on their fore-part, the inner surface of these veins, and of the right auricle, will be seen lined by a smooth membrane ; and in the auricle, the musculi pectinati, or bundles of muscular fibres, will be seen projecting. At the point of union between the two cavae, there is a projection formed by the thickening of the muscu- lar coat, the Tuberculum Loweri. The Septum AuuicuLARUM is seen separating the right from the2 ( 191. ) left auricle;—observe that it is thin, that in it there is an oval depression, named Fossa Ovalis. Round this fossa the fibres are thicker, forming the annulus ovalis ; this is the remains of the Foramen Ovale of the foetus; and in many adult subjects a probe may be passed through the superior part of the fossa obliquely into ihe left auricle. The Valvula NoBiLis, or Eustachian Valve, is a membrane like dupiicature of the inner coat of the auricle, observed where the vena cava inferior is continued into the auricle, and stretching from that vein towards the opening into the right ventricle. This valve is sometimes found reticulated. Behind this valve is the orifice of the Coronary Vein, with its small valve. The Foramina Thebesii are minute orifices of veins, which open into all the cavities of the heart; they are most numerous, however, in the right au- ricle. The 03TIUM Venosum, or opening of the right auricle into the right ventricle, is somewhat oval; it has a valve which projects into the right ventricle. The Right Ventricle may now be opened by an incision, carried from the root of the pulmonary artery down to the apex of the heart. This incision should be made with care, lest the parts on the in- side of the ventricle be destroyed by it; it should pass along the right side of the septum ventricu- lorum, the situation of which is marked out by large branches of .he coronary artery and vein. A small ©pening should first be made, into which one blade ©f the scissars can be introduced: the incision may beI 2 ( 105 ) be continued through the apex of the hc.irt, or .a flap may be made I)y another cut, passing from the beginning of the first alwng tlie margin of the right auricle.—In this ventricle, observe the projecting bundles of muscular fibres, the Tricuspid Valves arising from the margin of the ostium venosum, and projecting into the right ventricle. This valve fox*ms a complete circle at its base, but has its edge di' vided into three parts, which are attached by tendi- nous filaments, named Chords Tendine^, to the Carne.e CoLUMKiE, or muscular bundles of the rentricle. The Septum VENTRicuLonu.Nf, or partition of the two ventricles, is marked out externall}' by t^vo veins running from the apex to the basis of the heart. ' " ' Slit up the pulmonary artery; observe how it arises from the back-part of the right ventricle, hoyt smooth the inside of the ventricle becomes as it ap- proaches the entrance of the artery, or ostium arte- riosum. Observe the three Semiluvar or Siffmoid Valves. Their bases arise from the.artery, their loose edges project into its cavity, and in the middle of the loose edge of each valve is seen a small white bod}', termed Corpus Sesamoideum Arantii. The artery is seen bifurcating into the right and left pul- monary arteries, and, just before its bifurcation, sending off to the aorta the ductus arteriosus, which in the adult is a li<;ament. The Left Auricle has four pulmonary veins opening into its cavity, which may be exposed by slitting up two of those veins. Observe that its coats( 196 ) are tliicker than those of the right auricle. Tlie septum auricularum, with the fossa ovalis, is here seen less,distinctly than on the right side. Observe also the ostium venosum, opening into the left ven- tricle, and giving attachment to the Valvula Mi- TRALIS. The Left Ven'tricle may be opened in the same manner as the right, by an incision carefully Kiade in the left side of the septum or partition of the ventricles, and continued round the upper part of the ventricle, under the auricle. Observe the great thickness of the muscular coat; the Valvula MiTRALis, forming two projections, which.are at- tached by the chordae tendineae to the fleshy columns «f this ventricle. Slit up the aorta; it has three semilunar valve.«, which resemble those of the pulmonary artery;— behind these valves the artery bulges out, forming the Sinuses of the aorta. Above two of the valves lie the orifices of the two ceronary arteries, of which the left is the largest, CHAP.< 197 ) CHAR IX. DISSECTION OF THE FACE. SECT. I. OF THE MUSCLES. I^NDER the integuments of the face, thene is always a considerable quantity of adipose meui- brane;-many of the muscles ure very slender, and lying embedded in this fat, require careful dissection. The whole side of the face is also supplied with nu- merous ramifications of the facial nerve, or portio dura of the seventh pair. These nervous twigs are generally removed with the integuments. Twelve pair of muscles, and one single muscle, are described in this dissection. I. 'Ihe OiiBicuLAHis Palpebrarum—Arises, from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, and from a tendon at the inner angle of the eye, by a. number of fleshy fibres w hich pass round t le orbit, covering first the superior and then the in- ferior eye-lid, and also the bony edges of the orbit. Inserted, by a short round tendon, into the nasal procjiS of the superior maxillary bone. I 3 Situation:( 19S ) Situation: This muscle is intermixed, at its upper part, with the occipito-frontahs; it covers the upper part of the lacrymal sac. Use: To shut the eye, by bringing down the up- per lid, and puUing up the lower ; the fibres con- tracting towards the inner angle, as to a fixed point, compress the eye-ball and lacrymal gland, and con- vey the tears towards the puncta lacrymalia. Synonyma : Orbicularis palpebrarum et ciliarls ;— The ciliaris is only a part of the muscle covering the cartilages of the eye lids, which are called the Cilia or Tarsi;—Maxillo-palpebral. 2.

Situation : This muscle is concealed by the occi- p to-frontalis. It lies close to the upper and inner part of the orbicularis palpebrarum, with which it connected. Use: To smooth the skin of the fore-head, by pulling it down after the acti»n of the occipito- frontalis. When it acts more forcibly, it pulls down the eye-brow and skin of the fore-head, and pro- duces vertical wrinkles. Synonyrna: Musculus supercilii;—Musculus fron- talis verus, seu corrugator;—Cutaneo-sourcillier. 3. The Compressor Naris—Arises, narrow from the outer part of the ala nasi, and neighbouring part of the os maxillarc superius. From this origin a num-( 199 ) a number of thin separate fibres run up obliquely along the cartilage of the nose towards the dorsum nasi, where the muscle joins its fellow, and is Inserted, slightly, into the lower part of the os nasi and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Situation: It is superficial; its origin is con- nected with tlie levator labii superioris alseque nasi; and its upper part with some of the descending fibres of the occipito-frontalis. Use: To compress the ala towards the septum nasi; but, if the fibres of the occipito-frontalis, which adhere to it, act, the upper part of this mus- cle assists in pulling thfe ala outwards : It also cor- rugates the skin of the nose. Synonyma: Transversalis seu myrtiformis;—Dila- tores alarum nasi;—Constrictor nasi;—Maxillo-na- rinal.- 4f. Levator Labii Superioiiis Al^que Nasi —Arises by two distinct origins ; the first from the nasal process of the superior ma>:illary bone, where it joins the os frontis at tue inner can'hus of the eye; it descfends along the nasal process, and is inse ted into the outer part of the ala na^i, and into the upper h'p.—The second arises, broad and fleshy, from the external orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the foramen infra-orbila- rium; it runs down, becoming narrower, and is inserted mto the upper lip and orbicularis oris. Situation: The first portion is sometimes called Levator Labii Superioris Ateque Nasi, and the se-- cond Levator Labii Superioris Proprius. Their ori- gins are partly covered by the orbicularis palpebra- I 4) rum«( 200 ) rum. They descend more outwardly than the ala i.asi. Use: To raise the upper lip towards the orbit, and a little outwards ; the first portion will also draw the ala nasi upwards and outwards. Sijnonyma : Incisivus lateralis et pyramidalis;— Elevator labii superioris proprius ;—Ivlaxiilo-labii- nasal. The infra-orbitary artery, vein, and nerve, are seen emerging from the infi a-orbitary foramen under this muscle. 5. ZyGOMATicxJs Minor—Arises, from the upper prominent part of the os malae, and, descending obliquely downwards and forwards, is Inserted into the upper lip near the corner of the mouth. Situation : Its origin is covered by the oi'bicularis palpebrarum ; it has its course between the Levator labii superioris aloeque nasi and the zygomaticus major. Frequently the orbicularis palpebrarum sends down a slip of fibres to the upper lip, which slip runs between the zygomaticus minor and levator labii su- perioris alaeque nasi. Use : To draw the corner of the mouth and upper lip obliquely upwards and outwards. Synnnyma: Petit zygomato-labial. 6. Zygomaticus Major—Arises, flcshj', from the OS malre, uear the zygomatic suture. Insetted into the angle of the mouth, appearing to be lost in the depressor anguli oris, and orbicularis oris. Situation : Its origin is partially covered by the orbicularis( 201 ) Orbicularis palpebrarum ; it lies more outwardly than the zygomaticus minor. Use: To draw the corner of the mouth and under lip upwards and outwards. Synonyma : Zygomaticus ;—Grand zygomato-Ia- biiU. 7. The Levator AnculiOris—Arises, thin and flesliy, from a depression of the superior maxillary bone betwixt the root of the socket of the first dens moralis, and the foramen infra orbitarium. Inserted, narrower, into the angle of the mouth. Situation : It lies more outwardly than the levator labil superioris alacque nasi; it is in part concealed by that muscle, by the zygomaticus minor, and part of the zygomaticus major. At its insertion it is par» ticularIyj;onnected with the depressor anguli oris. Use : To draw the corner of the mouth upwards^ Synonijma : Levator labiorum comnmnis;—Cani- Bus ;—Sus-maxillo-labial. 8. The Depressor Anguli Oris—Arises^ broad and fleshy, from the lower edge of the inferior max- illary bone, at the side of the chin,, and gradually becomiiig narrower^ is Inserted into the angle of tlie mouth. Situation : Tliis muscle is firmly connected witli the platysma myoides ; at its insertion it. is blended, with the zy'gomaticus major and leviitor anguli oi'is*. Use:. To pull doAvn the corner of the mouth. Synoni/ma : Depressor labiorum communis;—TrC angularis; Sous maxillo-labial. 9. The Di-.pRESsoR Lacii Inferiorts—Arises^. fleshy and bxoadj from the side of the lower jaw, a J. 5. little-( ^02 ) little above its lower edge; it runs obliqu^y up- wards and inwards, and is Inserted into the edge of the under Hp. Situation : This muscle, at its insertion, decussates with its fellow. It is in part covered by the depres- sor anguli oris. It forms the thick part of the chin, and has its fibres interwoven with fat. Use : To pull the under lip downwards. Synonyma : Depressor labii inferioris proprius Quadratus ;—Mentonier-labial. 10. The Buccinator—Arises^ tendinous and fleshy, from the lower jaw, as far back as the root of the coronoid process; from the upper jaw, as far back as the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone; it then continues to arise from the alveolar processes of both jaws, as far forwards as the denies cuspidati. The fibres run forward, and are Inserted into the angle of the mouth. Situation : This muscle lies deep, adheres to the membrane that lines the mouth ; and a quantity of fat is always found between its fibres and the other muscles and integuments. It is partly concealed by the masseter, and by the muscles which pass to the angle of the mouih, as the levator and depressor anguli oris, and zygoraaticus majoi*. It is inserted behind these muscles. In the cheek it is connected with the platysma myoides. Use : To draw the angle of the inouth backwards and outwards, and to contract its cavity, by pressing the cheek inwards. Synonyma : llctractor anguli oris ;—Alveolo- tnaxiUaire. The( 20S ) The single muscle is the Orbicularis Oris.—It consists of two planes of semicircular fibres, which decussate at the angles of the mouth. These fibres are formed chiefly by the muscles which are inserted into the lips ; they sur- round the mouth. The superior portion runs along the upper lip, the inferior portion along the under lip. Situation : It is connected and intermixed with the insertions of all the preceding muscles of the face. Some of the fibres are connected to the septum nasi, and are by Albinus termed Nasalis Labii Superioris. Use : To shut the mouth by contracting and drawing both lips together. Synonyma: Sphincter labiorum ;—Semi-orbicula- ris superior et inferior:—Constrictor labiorum;— Labial. 11. Depressor Labii Superioris Alequ^ N \ SI—Arises, thin and fleshy, from the os maxil- lare superius, where it forms the alveoli of the dentes incisiva and dens caninus ; thence it runs up under part of the levator labii superioris alteque nasi. Inserted into the upper lip and root of the ala nasi. Situation : It is concealed by the orbicularis oris and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. It may be discovered by inverting the upper lip, and dissecting on the side of the frenum which connects the lip to the gums Use : To draw the upper lip and- ala nasi down- wards and backwards. hijnonymd: Depressor alae nasi;—Incisivus me« dius;—Depressor labii superioris proprius;—^Max- illo-alveoli nasal. I 6 12. The( 204. ) 12. The Levator Labii Ikferioris—Arisesy from the lower jaw at the root of the alveolu3 of the lateral incisor. Inserted into the under lip and skin of the chin. Situation : Those two small muscles are found by the side of the frenura of the lower lip. They lie under the depressor labii inferioris. Use : To raise the under lip and skin of the chin. Synonyma : Levator raenti;—Incisivus inferior;— Elevator labii inferioris proprius;—Sous-maxillo- cutane. On the side of the face we observe two strong muscles, and two other muscles are concealed by the angle of the inferior maxilla. 1. The Masseter, is divided into two portions, which decussate one another. The Anterior Portion arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the superior maxillary bone, where it joins the OS malas:; from the lower edge of the os malae, and from its zygomatic process. The strong fibres rua obliquely downwards and backwards, and are fn- serted into the outer surface of the side of the lower jaw, extending as far back as its angle. The Posterior Portioa arises, principally fleshy, from the inferior surface of the os malas, and of the whole of the zygomatic process, as far back as the tubercle before the socket for the condyle of the lower jaw. The fibres slant forwards, and are ?72« serted, tendinous, into the outer surface of tlie core- Boid process of the lower jaw.. Situation : The anterior portion conceals almo&t Ihe whole of the posterior portion. The greater part of I( 205 ) of this muscle is saperficiiil. Below, it is covered by the platysma myoides; ami above, a small portion of it is concealed by the origin of the zygomaticus major. Use: To pull the lower to the upper jaw, and to move it forwards and backwards. Synonyma: Zygomato-maxillaire. 2. Temporalis—Arises, fleshy, from a semicir- cular ridge in the lower and lateral part of the pa- rietal bone, from all the squamous portion of the temporal bone, from the external angular process of the OS frontis, from the temporal process of the sphenoid bone, and frooi an aponeurosis which co- vers the muscle. From these different origins the fibres converge, descend under the bony jugum formed by the zygomatic processes of the temporal and cheek bones. Inserted, by a strong tendon,, into the upper part of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, to which it adheres on every side, but more particularly its fore- part, where the insertion is continued down to near the last dens molaris. Situation: This muscle is of a semicircular shapci It is covered by a fascia or aponeurosis. This fascia adheres to the bones which give origin to the upper part of the muscle, and, descending over it, is in- serted into the jugum, and adjoining part of the os mala? and os frontis. The temporalis, at its origin, lies under the expanded tendon of the occipito-frontaiis, and under the small tendons which move the exter- nal ear. Its insertioais concealed by the jugum and. by( 206 ) by the masseter; so that, to expose it, the masseter must be cut away. Use: To pull the lower jaw upwards, and press it against the upper. Synonyma : Crotaphites;—Arcadi-temporo-max- illaire. In order to expose the following muscles, we must remove the muscles of the cheek and jaw, the mas- seter and insertion of the temporalis must be takea away, and the coronoid process of the inferior max- illa removed by a saw» ' 3. The Pterygoideus Externus—Arises, from the outer side of the external plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, from part of the tube- rosity of the OS maxillare adjoining to it, and from the root of the temporal process of the sphenoid bone. It passes backwards and outwards, to be Inserted into a depression in the neck of the con- dyloid process of the lower jaw, and into the anterior and inner part of the ligament of the articulation of that bone. Situation : This muscle passes almost transversely from the skull to its insertion. It is concealed by the muscles^f the face and neck, and by the ascend- ing processes of the lower jaw. Use: When this pair of muscles act together, they bring the jaw horizontally forwards. When they act singly, the jaw is moved forwards, and to the oppo- site side. Syno7iyma : Pterygoideus minor;—Pterigo-colli- Boaxillaire. 4.1 he( 207 ) 4. The Ptekygoideus Internus—Arises, ten- dinous and fleshy, from the inner and upper part of the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, filling all the space between the two plates; and from the pterygoid process of the os palati between these plates. Insertedy by tendinous and fleshy fibres, into the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. Situation : 1 o expose this muscle, the jaw must be removed from its articulating cavity, and then pulled forwards, and toward the opposite side; or it may be sawn across at its symphysis, and the other half re- moved. It is larger than the pterygoideus externus; and betwixt the two muscles there is a considerable quantity of cellular membrane, and the trunk of the inferior maxillary and gustatory nerves. Like that muscle, it is concealed by the lower jaw and facial muscles. Along its posterior edge we »-bserve the Ligamentum Laterale Maxillae Inferioris, a ligamen- tous band, which extends from the back-part of the styloid process to the angle of the lower jaw. Use: To draw the jaw upwards, and obliquely towards the opposite side. Synonyma: Pterygoideus major;—Pterigo-anguli- maxillaire. . , On the side of the face is situated a considerable salivary gland, the Pakotid Gland, a large white mass, irregularly oblong and protuberant, filling up all the space betwixt the angle and ascending pro- cesses of the jaw, the mastoid processes, root of the cartilage of the ear, and zygomatic process of the temporal bone, from its anterior and upper part a white( 208 ) ^vI^lte canal or duct passes forwards over the masse- ter, and perforates the buccinatar from without in- wards, opening into the mouth opposite the first dens molaris. The coats of tin's duct are very tliick and firm, consisting of a ligamentous substance. SECT. II. OF THE VESSELS ANI> NERVES OF TIZE FACE. ARTERIES. The a. Maxillauis Externa, the third branch of the carotid, comes from the neck over the lower jaw at the anterior edge of the masseter. It then runs under the depressor anguli oris, passes towards the angle of the mouth, and is often much contorted. Here it is named the A. Facialis or Angularis. It ascends by the side of the nose, and reaching the inner angle of the eye, is lost on the muM:ks situated there, inosculating frecl}^ vAih the temporal, internal maxillary, and ophthalmic arteries. In this course it gives off many branches; 1. Twigs to the masseter^ depressor anguli oris, and thin; '2. A. Cohonahia Labiorum. This artery is very much contorted.—- At the angular conxmissure of the lips, it divides itr self into two brandies, which run along tlve superior and inferior portions of the orbicularis oris, and join the same branches of Uic other side. 3. While the facial artery ascends by the side of the uose,.it gives( 209 ) oiFlIie external nasal artoric's to the outside of the nose, and the A. Buceales to tlie check. Tne Kxternal Carotid is found ascending behind the parotid gland. It perforates the gland at its up- per part, ascends over the zygomatic process iininc- diatelv before t!ie ear, and divides into the anterior, midiile, and posterior temporal arteries, which ranuiy over the side of the head, giving also branches to the forehead and occiput. But ihe carotid, while it lies imbedded under the parotiJ, sends several twigs to tlio substance of that gland, and a considerable artery which passes for- wards, and ramifying on the side of the face, is named A. Tkansversalis Faciei. At this point also, the carotid sends otf a large artery, the A. Maxlllaris Interna. As many branches of this artery are met with in the dissection of the face, it is proper to give a view of its distribution. The internal Maxillary passes behind the condy- loid process of the lower jaw ; it directs its course towards the bottom of the orbit of the eye ; and it is at tliis point th it it sends off its numerous branches. (1.) Arteria Media Dur.^ Matris (or Menin- gea sp'aeno-spinalis or spinosa), passes through the spinal hole of the sphenoid bone into the cranium, and is distributed to the dura mater. (2.) A Max- illaris Inferior, vel Dentalis Inferior, runs down- wards, enters the foramen at the root of the ascend- ing processes of the lovrcr jaw, then passes through the canal of the lower jaw; supplying the teeth and sockets, and emerges by the foramen mentale, to be distributed to the chia. It is accompanied by a nerve( 2ro ) nerve and one or two veins. (3.) A. Pterygoidcae and A. Temporales Prol'undtB, are small branches of the internal muxillary which pass to the pterygoid muscles, and to the inner part of the temporal mus- cle. (4.) A Pharyngeae, branches to the phaiynx, palate, and base of the skull. (5.) A. Alveolaris, which gives brcmches to the teeth of the upper jaw, and to the jaw bone itself. (6.) A Branch through the foramen spheno-palatinum to the nose; and, (7.) An Artery through the palato-maxiilary canal to the palate. The continued trunk of the internal maxillary en- ters the orbit by the spheno-maxillai-y slit. It sends off a branch which runs along the inner side of the orbit, and passes out at the inner canthus of the eye on the forehead.. The artery itself runs along the boitorn of the orbit in a canal on the upper part of the great tuberosity of the os maxillare superius, and emerges by the foramen infra-orbitarium on the face; hence it is termed A. Infra-Orbitaria, and is distributed to the cheek and side of the nose. The Frontal Artery is also seen in the dissec- tion of the face, passing from the orbit through the foramen supra-orbitarium to be distributed to the forehead. This artery is sent off from the ophthal- mic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid. If the face be injected, a remarkable anastomosis of arteries will be observed at the inner angle of the eye. VEINS.( 2n ) VEINS. The veins of the face are numerous, and pass into the extcniiU and internal jugular veins. NERVES. 1. The PouTio Dura of the seventh pair, Ner- vus Communicans Faciei, or Facial nerve, after its course through the temporal bone in the aqueduct of Fallopius, comes out by the foramen stylo-mastoi- deum. It immediately gives off branches to the neighbouring parts, as behind the ear. It thea passes througli the substance of the parotid gland, and emerges on the face in three great branches, which^have frequent mutual communications: this division of the nerve is called Pes Anserinus. (1.) The ascending branch ramifies on the temple and forehead. (2.) The middle branch sends its ramifications over the side of the face, the proper Facial Nerves. (3«) The descending branch sends its twigs along the chin, down upon the neck, and backwards upon the occiput. 2 The Superior Cervical Nerves send off several branches, which ramify on the side of the face and head, and communicate freely with the branches of the portio dura. As, in the course of this dissection, we meet with many twigs of the second and third branches' of the fifth pair of nerves, it will be advisable here to de- scribe these nerves, 3. Nervus( 212 ) 3. Nervus IMAxiLLAnis Superior, or Second Branch of the Fifth Pair. The superior maxillary nerve, having left the cranium by the foramen rotun- dum of the sphenoid bone, emerges behind tie an- trum maxillarc, at the lower back part of the orbit, and at the root of the pterygoid process of t!ie spiie- noid bone. It immediately sends out branches; 1. A small branch which passes through the spheno- maxillary slit to the periosteum and fat of the orbit. 2. The largest branch is the Infra-Orbitary Nerve. It enters the channel in the ton of the an- trum maxillare, accompanying the infra-orbitary arterj'^, comes out at the foramen infra-orbitarium, and is widely distributed to the cheek, under lip, and outside of the nose, communicating with ramifi- cations of the portio dura. 3. Branches to the tem- poral muscle, OS malae, <S:c. 4. Other branches form a small ganglioH at the root of the orbit, which sends twigs, named the superior Nasal Nerves, through the foramen spheno-palatinura to the nose. 5. The Vidian Nerve, which enters the foramen pterygoi- deum, and passes again into the cranium, to connect itself with the portio dura. 6. The Palatine Nerve, which runs througli the palato-maxillary canal to the palate. 7. Twigs which supply the gums and alveoli of the upper jaw. if. Nekvus Maxillaris Inferior, or Third Branch of the Fifth Pair. The inferior maxillary nerve leaves the cranium by the foramen ovale of the sphenoid bone. It has its course downwards and outwards; and, having given twigs to the parts near which it passes, as themasseter, pterygoid, and tem- poral( 215 ) poral muscles, It divides at the angle of tho lower jaw into two branches. 1. The Nervus D^ntalis Inferior enters the foramen at tlie angle of the lower jaw; accompanies the inferior dental artery along the canal in that bone, giving nerves to the teeth; emerges by the foramen mentale, and is distributed to the chin. 2. The Nervus Gustatorius, vel Linguales, passes to thetongue. It was seen in the dissection of the neck lying close upon the lower jaw-bone, below the in- ferior edge of the pterygoideus-internus, and above the superior fibres of the niylo-hyoideus. It supplies the substance of the tongue, and the salivary glands situated at the root of the tongue. This nerve receives the chorda tympani, a small twig which comes from the seventh pair througli the slit in the articulating cavity of the temporal bone. 5. In the dissection of the face, we also meet with the Frontal Nerve, which comes from the first branch of the fifth pair, and which is seen accompa- nying the frontal artery through the foramen supra- orbitarium. It is distributed to the forehead. CHAP, 1( 214 ) CHAP. X. DISSECTION OF THE THROAT. ^~^N looking into the mouth, we observe a soft curtain hanging from the palate bones, named the Velum Pendulum Palati, or soft Palate. The apex of the velum forms a small projectingglan- dular body, teinned the Uvula, or pap of the throat. From each side of the uvula, two muscular half- arches or columns are sent down, the anterior to the root of the tongue, the posterior to the side of the pharynx. Between these half-arches on each side, are situated the glands termed Amygdale, or Tonsils. The common opening behind the anterior arch is named the Fauces, or top of the Throat, from which there are six passages, two upwards, being one to each nostril, called the Posterior Nostrils ; two at the «ides, called Eustachian Tubes, passing on each side to the ear * ; two downwards, of which the anterior is the passage through the glottis and larynx into the ♦ A probe may be introduced throngh tlie anterior nostrili into the Eustacliian tube ; the tube opens into the pharynx in a direction opposite to the space between the roots of the mid- dle and iid'arioi turbinated bouci.

The Larynx is composed of five Cartilages: 1. TTie Thyroid Cartilage, situated immediately below the os hyoides in the middle of the throat. 2. The C R rcoiD Cartilage, situated immediately below the thyroid cartilage, betwixt it and the superior rings of the trachea. 3. The Epiglottis, a broad triangular cartilage, very elastic, situated behind the root of the tongue, and covering the entrance into the upper part of the larynx. 4-. and 5. The arytenoid cartilages, two small bodies, like peas, situated be- hind the thyroid cartilage, on the upper edge of the back-part of the cricoid cartilage, and between the two ala3 or wings of the thyroid cartilage. These two small cartilages form betwixl tliemselves and the thy- roid a longitudinal fissure, extending from before backwards, which is called the Glottis, or Rima Glottidis, and leads to the trachea. The muscles situated about the glottis consist of four pair of small muscles, and a single one. 1.

DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT OF THE EYE, rjpHE globe or ball of the eye is situated about the middle of the orbit. It is connected to the bone of its muscles, and by the optic nerve ; and all these parts are embedded posteriori)' in a soft, fatty substance, which fills up the bottom of the orbit,— The tunica, or membrana conjunctiva, is seen lining the inn^r surface of the eyelids, and reflected from them over the anterior part of thj gl ibj or the eye, so that the back-p.irt of the eye-bally and all the muscles and nerves, are situated behmd it. This membrane must therefore be dissected aw .y, the up- per part of the orbit, which is formed by the os fron- tis, removed with a saw, and the fat surrounding the muscks, vessels, and nerves, cautiously dissected away with the scissars. SECT. I. MUSCLES SITUATED WITHIN THE ORBIT. Seven muscles are contained within the orbit, of which one belongs to the upper eye-lid, and six to the globe of the eye. K 4 1. Thef 224- ) 1. The Levator Palpebr^ SuPERionis— Arises, hy a small tendon, from the upper part of the foramen opticum of the sphenoid bone; the tendon forms a broad flat belly. Inserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the uppep eye-lid, adhering to the tarsal cartilage, which gives form to the eye-lid. Use : To open the eye, by drawing the superior eye-lid upwards. Syrioniima : Aperienspalpebram rectus:—Orblto- 6U palpebral. ' There are four straight muscles, or recti, belong- ing to the globe of the eye. These fourmuscles re- semble each other, all arising by narrow tendons from the margin of the foramen opticum, where they surround the optic nerve; all forming strong fleshy bellies, and inserted, by broad, thin tendons, at the fore-part of the globe of the eye, into the tunica sclerotica, or outer tunic of the eye, and under the tunica conjunctiva. 2. The Levator Oculi—Arises, by a narrow tendon,' from the upper part of the foramen opticum of the sphenoid bone; it forms a fleshy belly, and ig Inserted into the superior and anterior part of th« tunica sclerotica, by a broad thin tendon. Situation : It lies below the levator palpebrae su- perioris. Use : To raise the globe of the eye. Synonyma : Elevator;—Rectus attollens oculi ;— sus-optico spheni-scleroticien. 3. The Depressor Oculi—Arisesirom the infe- rior margin of the foramen opticum, and is InsertedI ( 22J ) Inseiied into tlie inferior and anterior part of the tunica sclerotica. Use: To more the globe of the eye downwards • Sijnoni/ina : Rectus doprimens oculi;—Sous-opti " $pheno-scleroticien. 4. The Adductor Oculi—Arises, from the inner part of the foramen opticum, and is Inscried into the inner and anterior part of the tunica sclerotica. It is the shortest of the four recti muscles^ Use : To draw the eye towards the tiose. Synonymn : Rectus adducens oculi;—Orbito-in«- tus-scleroticien. 5. The Abductor Oculi—^rise^ from the outer part of the foramen opticum. Inserted into the outer part of the tunica sclerotica-. It is the longest of the recti. Use : To move the globe outwards. Synonyma : Rectus abducens oculi —Orbito-ex» tus-scleroticien. The two next are oblique muscles. 6. The Obliquus Superior, or Trochjearrs"— -<f^me5, bj'a small tendon, from the margin of the foramen opticum, betvveen the levator and abductor oculi. Its long slender belly runs along the inner Bide of the orbit to the internal angular process of the OS frontis, wJiere a cartilaginous pully is fixed. The muscle then forms a tendon, which passes through the pully, runs obliquely downwards and outwards, inclosed in a membranous sheatli.; and becoming broader and thinner, is Inserted into the tunica sclerotica, about half-waj^^ K.5' betvveeni( 226 ) between tlie insertion of the levator oculi, and the entrance of the optic nerve Use: To roll the globe of the eye, and turn the pupil downwards and outwards. Synonyma: Obliquus major; —Optico-trochlei- scleroticien, 7. The Obliquus Inferior—^mes, narrow, and principally tendinous, from the < uter edge of the orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone, near its junction with tiie os unguis. It runs obliquely outwards and backwards^ under the depressor oculi, and is. hiserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the sclero- tica, between the entrance of the optic nerve, and the insertion of the abductor oculi. Use : To draw the globe of tJie ey^ ferwards, in- wards and downwards,, and to turn the pupil up- wards. Synonyma : Obliquus major;—Maxillo-scleroti- cien. In the orbit, we also meet with the Lachrymal Gland.—This gland is of a yellowish colour; it is situated in a depression of the os frontis near the temple. It adheres closely to the fat which sur- rounds the muscles and posterior convexity of the eye. It sends ofi'sev small ducts which pierce the tunica conjunctiva lining the upper eye-lid; these, ducts cannot be seen, unless the part be macerated in water, when they are filled with the liquid. The PvNCTA L«ACHRYMALiA are two small holes tiear the internal angle of the palpebrai, situated one. ip each eye-lid. They lead into the Lachrymal Sac.( 227 ) Sac. This sac Is an oblong membranous hag, situa- ted at the inner angle of the eye, in a depression formed by the os unguis, and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone It receives the tears by the puncta lachrymalia, and from the sack they are con- veyed into the nose by a Duc r, named the Lach- RYM VL, or Nasal. The lower extremity of thig duct opens into the nose on one side of the antrum niaxillare, and under the os spongiosum inferius. A probe, with its extremity bent, may be intro- duced from the nose through this duct into the lachrymal sac. The Caruncula Lachrymalis is a small reddish granulated body, situated at the internal angle of the paJpebrae. SECT. n. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES MET WITH IN THE ORBir OF THE EYE. ARTERIES.' The'Ophthalmic, or Ocular Artery, is a branch of tlie internal carotid. It enters the orbit from the basis of the cranium by the foramen opti- cura. It gives branches to the lachrymal gland, fat, muscles, and globe of the eye. One twig, named the A. Centralis Retinas, enters the substance of the optic nerve, and is continued on to the retina;—• K 6 Iwig*( 228 ) twigs also pass to the eye lids, and to the inner an- gle of the eye. The arteria Frontalis is a branch of this artery ; it is seen running towards the supra- orbitary notch or foramen, and is distributed to the forehead. The Ikfra-Orbitary Artery is found in the lower part of the orbit; it is the continued trunk of the internal maxillary, entering the orbit by the spheno-maxillary slit. It is seen passing along the canal in the upper pare of the great tuberosity of the OS maxillare superius, and emerges on the fac* by the infra-orbitary hole. VEINS. Thesecorrespond with the arteries; they discharge their blood partly into the branches of the external jugular vein near the forehead and temples, and partly into the internal jugular, NERVES. 1. The Optic nerve is seen coming through the foramen cpticura, and entering the back-part of the globe of the eye, to form the retina. 2. The Nerve of the Third Pair, Motok Oculi, having entered the orbit through the superior orbi- tary fissure, or loramen lacerum, is divided into four branches. (1.) The first runs upwards, and subdivides into two nerves, of which one supplies the levator oculi, and the other the levator palpebrae superioris. (2.) The second branch goes to the depressor oculis, and is short. (3.) The( 229 ) (3.) The third branch supplies the obliquus infe- rior, and also gives oli' a twig, wiuca ussisis in form- ing the lenticular ganglion. (4.) The fourth branch supplies the adductor oculi. 3. The Nerve of the Fourth Pair, N. Patheti- cus, or Trochlearis, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and runs to the obliquus superior. 4. The first branch of the Nerve of the Fifth Pair^ named Ophthalmic, or Orbitarj, enters the orbit by the superior orbitary fissure, and divides into three branches. (1.) The FuGNTAL, Supra-orbitary, or Superci- liary Nerve accompanies the frontal artery along the upper part of the orbit, close to the bone; and having "passed through the supra-orbitary notch, "is distributed to the forehead. (2.) The Nasal Nerve, or inner branch, runs towards the nose, and is distributed to the inner side of the orbit, and to the nose. (3.) The Temporal or Lacrymal Branch, supplies the lacrymal gland, and the parts at the outer side of the orbit. The Lenticular Ganglion is a small ganglion, situated within the orbit, formed by snort brandies of the ophthalmic nerve, and by a twig of the tnu'd pair. It sends off delicate nerves, which run along the sides of the optic nerve, and pierce the coats of the eye. 5.1 he second branch of the Fifth Pair, called the SuPERiou Maxillary nerve, sends off a branch through the bony canal in the bottom of the orbit. ThisI ( 230 ) This is the Infra oruitarv Nerve. It accom- panies the artery of the same name, and emerges on the face by the infra-orbitary hole. 6. The trunk of the Sixth Pair of Nerves passes through the superior orbitary fissure to the abductor oci li. These delicate nerves are surrounded by the adi- pose substance found in the orbit, and require to be dissected with the utmost care. CHAP. XII. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE TRUNK AND NECK. JpROM the number and intimate connection of these muscles, their description necessarily is complicated, and their dissection difficult. The smaller muscles, indeed, cannot be separated, with- out dividing some of their fibres. We do not here, as in the limbs, find the muscles distinctly marked, loosely connected by cellular membrane, and sepa- rated with facility ; but closely united, and in many places having their fibres so intermixed, as to render their divisions indistinct and uncertain.(. «S1 ) In this dissection we meet with twenty-two dis- tinct pair of muscles, besides a number of small muscles situated between the processes of contigu- ous vertebrse. On removing the integuments of the posterior part of the neck and back, v/e expose, 1. The Trapezius—It arises, by a thick round tendon, from the lower part of the protuberance in the middle of the os occipitis behind, and, by a thin tendinous expansion, from the superior transverse ridge of that bone ; from the five superior cervical spinous processes by the ligaraentum nuchse; ten- dinous, from the two inferior cervical spinous pro- cesses, and from the spinous processes of ail the ver- tebrae of the back, i'he fleshy fibres coming from the neck descend obhquJy, while those from the back ascend. Inserted^ fleshy, into the posterior third part of the clavicle ; tendinous and fleshy, into tUe acromion, and into the upper edge of all the spine of the sca- pula. The fibres sliae over a triangular surface at the extremity of the spine of that bone. aituation : This muscle is quite superficial, and conceals all the muscles situated in the posterior part of the neck, and upper part of the back. It adheres to its fellow the whole length of its origin. Its an- terior hbres lie posterior to those of the sterno-mas- toideus, but are not in contact with them, a consi- derable quantity Of adipose substance being inter- posed. The posterior cervical ligaments, (ligamentuoi nuchae vel colli,; is a ligament which arises trom the middle of the occipital bone, runs down on the back-( 232 ) back-part of the neck, adhering to the spinous pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae, and giving origin to fhe fibres of the trapezius, and of other muscles. Use : To move the scapula in different directions. The superior fibres dravi' it obliquely upwards, the middle transverse ones draw it directly backwards, aud the inferior fibres move it obliquely downwards and backwards. Also, to draw back the head, and contribute to its rotatory motions. Synonynm: Cucullaris ;—Occipitl-dorso-clavi-sus- acromien. It should be reflected from the spine and head. 2. Tlie Latissimus Dousi—Arises^, by a broad thin tendon, from all the spinous processes of the os sacrum, and of the lumbar vertebrae ; from the spi- nous processes of the seven inferior dorsal vertebrae; from the posterior part of the spine of the os ilium; also from the extremities of the four inferior false ribs, by four distinct fleshy digitations, which inter- mix with those of the obliquus excernus abdominis* The inferior fleshy fibres ascend obliquely ; the su- perior run transversely : they pass over the inferior angle of the scapula, (from which the muscle oftea - receives a thin fasciculus of fibres,) to reach the axilla, where they are all collected and twisted. Inserted, by a strong flat tendon, into the inner edge of the groove in the os humeri, which receives- the long tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. Situation : Where this muscle arises from the dor- sal vertebras, it is concealed by the origin of the tra- pezius. The remainder of it is placed immediately under the skin, and covers the deeper seated mus- cles( 233 ) des of the loins and back. It is situated superior to the gluteus niaximus, and posterior to the obhquu* extcrnus abdominis. Its insertion cannot be traced till the muscles of the arm are dissected; it forms tiie fuld on the posterior part of the hollow of the armpit. The tendon of this muscle, with the subja- cent tendon of the serratus posticus inferioi-, assists in forming the fascia iumborum. Use: To pull the arm backwards and downwards, and to roll the os humeri. It should be reEected from the spine, pelvis, and ribs. Si/nonjjma : Ani-scalptor ;—Dorsi-lumbo-sacro- luimeral. llsmove the trapezius and latissinius dorsi, and two muscle3'■^vill be seen passing from the neck to the scapula. 3. The Rhomboideus. This muscle is divided into two portions. (1.) Rhomboideus major, (the inferior portion,) arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the four or five superior dorsal vertebra. Inserted into all the base of the scapula below its spine, extending as far as its inferior angle. (2.) Rhomboideus Minor, (the superior portion,) arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the three inferior vertebra oi tae neck, and Ironi the li- gamentum nuchae. Inserted into the base of the scapula, opposite to the triangular plain surface at the root of the spine. Situation : This muscle lies beneath the trapezius and latissimus dorsi; a small part of the rhomboideus major( 234 ) major may be seen between these muscles, and the inferior part of the base of the scapula. Use: To draw the scapula obliquely upwards, and directly backwards. Synonyma : Cervici-dorso-scapulaire. The rhomboidei should be reflected from the spine. 4, The Levator Scapula—Jiises from the transverse processes of the five superior vertebrae of the neck, by five distinct tendinous and fleshy slips,, which unite and form a considerable muscle. Inserted, tendinous anil fleshy, into the base of the scapula, above the root of the spine, and under the superior angle, (not into the angle itselt^ as it is usu- ally described.) Situclion : This muscle is concealed by the trape- zius and sterno-mastoideus; but a small part , of its belly may be seen in the space between the edges of these muscles. The origin of the levator scapulae is partly concealed by the splenius capitis ; and the di- gitations, where they arise from the transverse pro- cesses, lie betwixt similar attachments of the scalenL- rouscles before, and of the splenius colli behind. Use: To draw the scapula upwards, and a little forwards. Syyionyma : Elevator, seu Musculus Paticntiae;— Angularis, vel Levator proprius ;—Trachclo-angiili. scapulaire. Detaching the rhomboideus from its origin in the spine, you will see another muscle passing from the whole of the basis of the scapula. 5t The SfinuATUs Magnus—Arises, by nine fleshy( 235 ) fleshy digitations, from the nine superior ribs. These tligitijtions are seen on tlie anterior part of the tho- rax ; they pass obliquely backwards, and form a strong fleshy muscle. Inserted, principally fleshy, into the whole of the base of the scapula. Siluation : This muscle lies between the scapula and the ribs, so that, to see its course, the articula- tion of the clavicle to the sternum should be divided, and the scapula lifted from the trunk. It is concealed by the latissimus dorsi, by the two pectoral muscles, and the scapula. The only part of it which can be seen before the removal of those muscles, projects betwixt and below them on the side of the trunk. 1 he lower digitations, which pass more anteriorly than tke edge of the latissimus dorsi, are intermixed with the superior digitations of the obliquus externus abdominis. The superior digitations arise behind the pectoralis minor. The insertion of the muscle is between the subscapularis, which arises from the internal surface of the scapula, and the insertions of the rhomboideus and levator scapulae. Use : To move the scapula forwards, and, w^hen the scapula is forcibly raised, to draw the ribs up- wards. St/noni/ma: Serratus major anticus;—Costo-basi- scapulaire *. I he removal of the rhomboideus also exposes, 6. The Serratus Superior Posticus. This muscle arises^ by a thin broad tendon, from the spi- * i he upper extremity may bow be removed from the trunk. nous( 236 ) nous processes of the three inferior cervical vertebrjjp, and of the two .superior dorsal. Inserted, by distinct lleshy slips, into the second, third, fourth, and sometimes the fifth ribs, a little be- yond their angle. Situation : Tliis muscle is concealed by the rhora- boideus and scapula, except a few of its superior fibres, which appear above the upper edge of the rhomboideus minor. It covers part of the origin of the splenius. Use : To elevate the rib', and dilate the thorax. Synonyjna : Cervici dorso-costal. Reflect it from the spine. 7. The Splenius is divided into two portions: (1.) The Splenius Capitis—Arises^ tendinous, from the spinous processes of the two superior dorsal, and five inferior cervical vertebrae. It forms a flat broad muscle, which ascends obliquely, and is inserted^ ten- dinous, into the posterior part of the mastoid process, and into a small part of the os accipitis, immediately below its superior transverse ridge. Situation: This muscle is covered by the trapezius, and by the insertion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and a small part of it is seen on the side of the neck betwixt those two muscles. The lower part of its origin is covered by the serratus superior posticus. Reflect it from the occiput. (2.) The Splenius Colli—/im^'^, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes thesixt'.i dorsal vertebrae. It formsa small fleshy belly, which ascends by the side of the verte- bras, and is inserted mto the transverse processes of the( 237 ) the four oi- five superior cervical vertebras, by dis- tinct tendons, which lie behind similar tendons of the levator scapulae. Situution: This muscle is concealed by the ser- ratus superior posticus, and splenius capitis. Use: To bring the head am i upper vertebrae of the neck obliquely backwards. When both muscles act, they pull the head directly backwards. Sijiwntpna: Cervici-dorsi-mastgidien, et dorso- tracholien. Reflect it from the dorsal vertebrae. 8. The Serratus Posticus Inferior—Arises, by a broad thin tendon, from the spinous processes of the two or three inferior dorsal vertebrae, and from the three superior lumbar spines by the fascia lumborum. Inserted^ by distinct fleshy slips, into the lower edges of the four inferior ribs, at a little distance- from their cartilages. Situation: This is a thin muscle, of considerable breadth, situated at the lower part of the back, un- der the middle of the latissimus dorsi. Its tendon lies under that of the latissimus dorsi, but, although firmly adhering to it, is distinct, and may be separa- ted by cautious dissection. Its insertion into the ribs is situirted immediately behind the attachments con- necting the latissimus dorsi to the ribs, which attach- ments must therefore lie behind the obliquus exter- jius abdominis, and serratus posticus inferior. Use: To pvdl the ribs downwards and backwards. Synonyma: Dorso-lumbo-costah Iteflect it from the spine. The( 238 ) Tlie Fascia Lumberum is now seen. It is a tendi- nous fascia, arising from the lumbar vertebrae and os sacrum, giving origin to the lower part of the serra- tus posticus inferior, and to the posterior fibres of the obliquus internus and transversalis abdominis. It is also connected with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. On detaching from the spine of this fascia, and the serratus posticus inferior, we expose a thick muscular mass, filling up all the space betwixt the spinous pro- cesses of the vertebrae, and the angles of the ribs. This mass consists of three muscles: (1.) Sacro-Lumbalis on the outside, (2.) Longissimus Dorsi in the middle, (3.) Spinalis Dorsi close to the spinous processes. These three muscles are closely connected toge- ther ; so that, to effect their separation, it is neces- ijarv to divide some of the fibres. 9 and 10, 'Ihe Sacko-Lcmbalis and Loxgis- SJMus Dorsi—Arises, by one common origin, ten- dinous externally, and flieshy internally, from the spinous processes and posterior surface of the os sacrum from the posterior part of the spine of the OS ilium, extending nearly as far forwards as the highest part of that bone when the body is erect; from the spinous processes, and from the roots of the transverse processes of all the lumbar vcrtebi'je. The thick fleshy belly, formed by this extensive origin^ ascends, and, opposite to the last rib, divides into the two muscles. The sacro lunibalis is inserted into all the ribs near their angles, by long and thin tendons. '1 he tendons which( ^39 ) Tvliich pass to the superior ribs are longer, ascend nearly straiglit, and are situated nearer to the spine than those tendons whicli pass to the lower ribs. On separating the inner edge of this muscle, (?. e. the edge next to the spine), from the latissimus dorsi, and turning the belly towards the ribs, we see six or ci^ht small tendinous and fleshy bundles, which pass from the inner side of this muscle, to be inserted into the upper edge of the six or eight inferior ribs. These arc called the Musculi Accessorii ad Sacro- Lumbalem. Use: To pull the ribs downwards, to assist in erecting the trunk ot the body, and in turning it to one side. Synonyma : Lumbo-costo-trachelien. The iongissimus dorsi is inserted into all the ribs except the two inferior, betwixt their tubercles and angles, by slips which are tendinous and fleshv, and into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebras by small double tendons. The insertions in the ribs proceed from the outer side of the muscle, while the attachments to the transverse processes are seen on separating the Iongissimus dorsi from the spinalis dorsi. Use: To extend the vertebrae, and keep the body erect. Synonijma: Lumbo-dorso-trachelien. 11. The Spinalis Dorsi is much smaller than the two last-described muscles ; below, it cannot be separated from the Iongissimus dorsi, without divid- ing some fibres-; it lies betwixt that muscle and the «pine. Arisesy( 240 ) Arises, tendinous, from the spinous processes of the two superior lumbar vertebrae, and of the three inferior dorsal. Imcrted into the spinous procesjes of the nine up- per vertebrae of the back, except the first, by as many distinct tendons. 17.se.- to extend the vertebrae, and to assist in raising the spine. Sj/non}/nin : Lumbo-dorsal-spinal. The three last-described muscles are covered be- low by the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi"; above, by the rhomboideus, serratus superior posticus, and trapezius. 12. The Cervicalis Descendens—Aj-ises from the upper edge of the four or five superior ribs, by as many distinct tendons, which lie on the inside of the tendinous insertions of the sacro-lumbalis. It forms a small belly, which ascends upwards, and is Inserted, by three distinct tendons, into the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrce. Sitiintion : This muscle is small, it is frequently desci-ibed as an appendage to the sacro-lumbalis It arises between the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the transverse processes between the splenius colli and levator scapulas; of course it is cmcealed by the rhomboideus, &c. It often receives a fleshy sljp from the upper part of the longissimus dor>i. Use: To turn the neck obliquely backwards. Synonymn : ransversalis coll.itcralis colli. 13. The Than-VERSA LIS Colli—Arises from .the transverse processes of the five superior dorsal vertebrae, 2( 241 ) vertebra, by five tendinous and fleshy slips, and is Inserted, tendinous, into the transverse processes of the five or six interior cervical vertel)rse.» Situation : The origin of this muscle lies on the inside of the longissimus dorsi, and is sometimes considered as an appendage to it. The insertion is situated between the cervicahs descendens and tra- chelo-mastoideus. Use : To turn the neck obliquely backwards, and a little to one side. Synonyma : Transvcrsalis cervicis;—Transversalis colli major. 14. The Trachelo-Mastoideus lies nearer to the bone than the last-described muscle. Arises from the transverse processes of the three uppermost vertebrae of the back, and of the rive in- ferior of the neck, by as many thin tendons, which unite and form a fleshy belly. Inset-ted, tendinous, into the posterior surface of the mastoid process. Situation : This muscle lies on the outside of the complexus, and on the inside of the transversalis colli; its insertion is concealed by the splenius capitis; it is covered also by the levator scapulae. Use: To keep the head and neck erect, and to draw the head backwards, and to one side. Synonyma: Trachelo-mastoideus, seu Capitis par tertium Fallopii;—Complexus minor, seu Mastoides lateralis. 15. The Complexus—Arises, by tendinous and fleshy fibres, from the transverse processes of the t< seven( 242 ) even superior dorsal, and of the four or five inferior cervical vertebras. It forms a thick, tendinous, and fleshy belly. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the hollow be- twixt the two transverse ridges of the os occipitis, extending from the middle protuberance of thatbone, nearly as far as the mastoid process. Situation : This is a large muscle. Its origin from the cervical vertebrfje is nearer to the spine than the trachelo mastoideus, and it arises in the back nearer to the spine than the transversalis colli; it is covered by the splenius ; but a large portion of it is seen between the splenius and spine, immediately on re- moving the trapezius. Use: To draw the head backwards, and to one side. Synonyma: Complexus, seu Biventer cervicis ;— Coraplexus major ;—Dorso-trachelo-occipital. On removing the complexus from the occiput, we find, close to the spine, 16. The Semi-Spinalis Colli.—It arises^ by distinct tendons, from the transverse processes of the six superior dorsal vertebrae, ascends obliquely close to the spine, and is . Inserted into the spinous processes of all the ver- tebrae of the neck, except the first and the last. Situation; This muscle is situated close to the ver- tebrae at the posterior part of the neck and back. It arises on the outside of the semi-spinalis dorsi; its greater part is concealed by the complexus and lon- gissimus dorsi; and the part which projects between these muscles, is concealed by the serratus superior posticus.

Inserted^ by distinct tendons, into the spinous pro- cesses of the five superior dorsal vertebrae, and of the two lower cervical. Situation : This muscle lies nearer the spine than the lower part of the semi-spinalis colli; its inferior origins lie on the outside of the insertion of the spi- nalis dorsi. Use : To extend the spine obliquely backwards. Synont^ma: Semi-spinalis externus, seu Trans- verso-spinalis dorsi. The removal of the complexus brings also iu view several small muscles situated at the superior part of the neck, immediately below the occiput. ~ ,. 18. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major— Arises, fleshy, from the side of the spinous process of the dentata, or second cervical vertebras. It ascends obhquely outwards, becoming broader, and is Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the inferior transverse ridge of the os occipitis, and into part of the concavity above that ridge. Situation: This muscle is situated obliquely be- tween the occiput and the second vertebras of the neck. It lies under the complexus; its outer fibres also pass under the insertion of the obliquus capitis superior. l2 Use:( ) Use : To extend and pull the head backwards, and to assist in its rotation. Synomjma : Rectus major;—Spino-axoido-occi- pital. 19. The Rfctus Capitis Posticus Minor— Arises, tendinous and narrow, from an eminence in the middle of the back part of the atlas, or first cer- vical yertebra. It becomes broader and is Inserted, fleshy, into the inferior transverse ridge of the OS occipitis, and into the surface betwixt that ridge and the foramen magnum. Situation: It is partly covered by the rectus capitis posticus major ; but a large portion of this pair of muscles is seen projecting between the recti majores, and is situated beneath the complexus. Use: To draw the head backwards. Synonyma : Rectus minor;—Tuber-atloido-occi- pltal. 20. Obliquus Capitis Superior—Arises, ten- dinous, from the upper and posterior part of the transverse process of the first cervical vertebra. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the inferior transverse ridge of the os occipitis behind the mas- toid process, and into a small part of the surface above and below that ridge. Situation: This muscle is situated laterally between the occiput and alias. It is inserted under the com- plexus and trachelo mastoideus, and it covers some of the outer fibres of the insertion of the rectus capitis posticus major. Use: To draw the head backwards, and to assist in rolhng it. Synonyma:( 245 ) Synonyma : Obliquus superior, sive Minor ;— Tra- chelo-atloido-occipital. 21.

The MuLTiFiDus SpinjE- On removing the muscles of the spine which have been described, we find situated beneath them the Multifidus Spinse. It is that mass of muscular flesh which lies close to the spinous and transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae, extending from the dentata to the OS sacrum. The bundles of which it is com- posed seem to pass from the transverse, to be in- serted into the spinous processes. Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the spinous processes and back-part of the os sacrum, and from the posterior adjoining part of the os ileum j from L 3 the( 246 ) the oblique and transverse processes of all the lum- bar vertebrae; from the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae; and from those of the cervi- cal vertebrae, excepting the three first. The fibres arising from this extensive origin pass obliquely, to be Inserted, by distinct tendons, into the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae of the loins and" back, and into those of the six inferior vertebrae of the neck. The fibres arising from each vertebrae are inserted into the second one above it, and sometimes more. Use: To extend the back obliquely, or move it to one side. When both muscles act, they extend the vertebrae backwards. Synonyma : Transversalis lumborum dorsi et colli; .—Transverso-spinalis lumborum, dorsi et colli; vel Semi-spinalis. The small muscles situated between the processes of the vertebrae are, 1. Interspinales colli, dorsi, et lumborum.— These are small bundles of fibres, which fill up the spaces between the spinous processes of the vertebra;. Each of these little muscles arises from the surface of one spinous process, and is inserted into the next spinous process. In the neck they are large, and appear double, as the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae are bi- furcated. In the back and loins they are indistinct, and are rather small tendons than muscles. Use: To draw the spinous processes nearer to each other. 2. The Inteutraksvebsales colli, dorei, et lum-( 247 ) lumborum, are small muscles which fill up, in a similar manner, the space between the transverse processes of the vertebra?. In the neck they are bifurcated and distinct, in the back, they are 3mall and slender, and in the loins they are strong and fleshy. ■ • Use: To draw the transverse processes towards each other. CHAP. XIII. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED BETWEEN THE RIBS, AND ON THE IN- NER SURFACE OF THE STERNUM. rj^HE muscles which fill up the space between the ribs are named Intercostals ; they are disposed on each side of the thoi-ax in two layers, and each layer consists of eleven muscles. The Intercostales Extern:—Arise from the inferior acute edge of each superior rib, extending from the spine to near the junction of the ribs with their cartilages. The fibres run obliquely forwards and downwards, and are Inserted into the upper obtuse edge of each infe- rior rib, from the spine to near the cartilage of the rib. L Situation:( 248 ) Situation; TJiese muscles are seen, on removing the muscles which cover the thorax. Synonyma: Inter-lateri-costaux. The Levatores Costa rum are twelve small muscles, situated on each sicle of the dorsal verte- brae. They are portions of the external intercostals. Each of these small muscles arises from the trans- verse process of one of the dorsal vertebrae, and passes downwards, to be Inserted into the upper side of the rib next below the vertebras, near its tuberosity. The first of these muscles passes from the last cer- vical vertebrae, the eleven others from the eleven superior dorsal vertebrae. The three or four inferior Levatores are longer, and run down to the second rib below the transverse process from which they arise. Hence Albinus names them the Levatores Costarum Longiores et Breviores. Synonyma: Supra costales. 2. The Intercostales Interni—Arise from the inferior acute edge of each superior rib, be- ginning at the sternum, and extending as far as the angle of the rib. The fibres run obliquely down- ivards and backwards, and are Inserted into the superior obtuse edge of each in- ferior rib from the sternum to the angle. Portions «f the internal intercostals pass over one rib, and are inserted into the next below it, Synonyma : Inter-pleuri-costaux. Thus the intercostal muscles decussate, and are double on the sides of the thorax; but, from the spine to the angles of the ribs, there are only the external intercostals, and, from the cartilages to the sternum,( 219 ) sternum-, only the internal, and some cellular mem- brane covering them. The whole of the internal intercostals, and the back-part of the external, are lined by the pleura. Use : To elevate the ribs, so as to enlarge the ca- vity of the thorax. One pair of muscles is situated on the inner sur- face of the sternum. The Triangularis Sterni, or Sterno-Cos- talis—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the edge of the whole cartilage ensiformis, and from th6 edge of ^ the lower half of the middle bone of the sternum. The fibres ascend obliquely upwards and outwards, and form a flat muscle, which is Inserted, by three or four triangular fleshy and tendinous terminations, into the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. Situation: This muscle lies on the inside of the ribs and sternum, and is lined by the pleura. Use: To depress the cartilages and the bony ex- tremities of the ribs, and consequently to assist in lessening the cavity of the thorax. CKAf.( 250 ) CHAP, XIV. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE NECK CLOSE TO THE VERTEBRJ2. Jl^OUR pair of muscles are here situated. 1. The LoNGus Colli—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the sides of the bodies of the three supe- rior dorsal vertebrae, and from the anterior surface of the transverse processes of the four or five lower cervical vertebrae. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the fore-part of the bodies of all the vertebras of the neck. Situation: This muscle lies behind the oesopha- gus, and behind the great vessels and nerves of the neck. Use: To bend the neck forwards, and to one side. Synonyma: Pre-dorso-cervical. 2. The Rectus Capitis Internus Majoh— Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the anterior points of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervicle vertebrae. It forms a considerable fleshy belly. hiseried into the cuneiform process of the os oc- cipitis a little before the condyloid process. Situation:( 251 ) Situation: This muscle lies before the scaleni and more outwardly than the longus colli, over the part of which it passes. Use : To bend the head forwards. Si^nonyma: Rectus anterior longus ;—Grand tra- chelo-basilaire. 3. The Rectus Capitis Internus Minor— jirises, fleshy, from the fore-part of the body of the first vertebra of the neck, near its transverse pro- cess ; and ascending obliquely, is Inserted near the root of the condyloid process of the occipital bone, under the last-described muscle. Use : To bend the head forwards. Synonyma : Rectus anterior brevis;—Petit-tra- chelo-basilaire. 4. The Rectus Capitis Lateralis—Arises, fleshy, from the anterior and upper part of the trans- verse process of the atlas. Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into a scabrous ridge of the os occipitis, which extends from tha condyloid process of that bone towards the mastoid process. Situation: It is situated immediately behind the internal jugular vein, where it comes out from the cranium. Use : To pull the head a little to one side. Synonyma : Transversalis anticus primua;—Tra- eheli atloido-lateral. CHAP.CHAP. XV. DISSECTION OF THE SUPERIOR EXTRE- MITY. SECT. 1. OF THE SHOULDER AND AEM. JN the thigh we saw a strong fascia, arising from the neighbouring bones and ligaments, firmly in- vesting the muscles, and giving origin to some of ,^heir fibres ; but, on removing the integuments of the shoulder and r-.rm, we do not meet with any regu- lar faeda. The muscles, like those on the outside of the thorax, are covered by condensed cellular sub- stance ; and this substance might be taken for a thin aponeurosis, but it is widely different in its nature, and ought to be regularly dissected off with the inte- guments. In removing the integuments, we meet with sere* ral cutaneous veins and nerves. The cutaneous veins * of the upper extremity are the following. 1. The Basilic Vein is seen arising from a small ♦ Thevcini are described from their origin in the fore-arm for the sake of perspicuity i they ramify above the fascia of Uie forewarn).( 253 ) vein on the outside of the little finger, named Salva- tella. It then runs along the inside of the fore-arm near the ulna, receiving the internal and external ulnar veins from the anterior and posterior surface of the fascia. It passes over the fold of the arm near the inner condyle of ihe humerus; here it is superficial. It ascends along the arm, becoming more deeply seated, and included in the sheath which invests the brachial artery. As it approaches the neck of the humerus, it sinks deep betwixt the folds of the arm-pit, and terminates in the axillary vein, which may be considered as a continuation of the basilic vein. It communicates with the deeper- seated veins, and receives numerous branches from the mu"§c]es. 2. The CisPHALic Vein begins on the back of the hand, between the thumb and metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, by a small vein, named Cephalica Pollicis. It runs along the radius between the mus- cles and integuments, receiving the internal and ex- ternal radial veins. It passes over the bend of the arm near the external condyle, and ascends along the outside of the arm near the outer edge of the biceps flexor cuhiti. It then runs betwixt the edge of the deltoid and pectoral muscles, dips down under the clavicle, and enters the subclavian vein. In all this course the cephalic vein receives branches. 3. The Median Vein. Several veins are seen running along the middle of the anterior part of the fore-arm. The trunk formed by these veins is called the Mediana Major. It ascends on the flat part of the fore-arm, betwixt the basilic and cephalic veins, and( 254> ) and bifurcates at the fold of the arm into two branches; 1. The Mediana Basilica, passing off ob- liquely to join the basilic vein ; 2. The Mediana Cephalica, which joins the cephalic. The cutaneous nerves of the arm are seen ramify- ing above the muscles ; they consist of, 1. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve, a branch of the axillary plexus. It is seen accompanying the basilic vein, and twisting its fibres over it. It de- scends along the inside of the arm, crosses over the fore-part of the elbow-joint, and, in the dissection of the fore-arm, will be seen dividing itself into twigs, which ramify between the fascia and integu- ments, and are distributed to the inside of the fore- arm and wrist. 2. The upper part of the arm receives cutaneous nerves from the branches of the dorsal nerves, which come out of the thorax between the ribs. 3. The shoulder and back-part of the scapula re- ceive twigs from the cervical nerves. 4. The external cutaneous, ulnar, and spiral nerves, also send twigs to the integuments of the arm and fore-arm. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE SHOULDER AND ARM. These are ten in number. 1. The Deltoides—^/ wes, tendinous and fleshy, from the posterior third of the clavicle, from the whole edge of the acromion, and from the lower margin of the whole spine of the scapula. From these( 255 ) these several origins the fibres run In different direc tions, and converge. Those arising from the clavicle run outwards and downwards: those from the spine of the scapula outwards, forwards, and downwards; and those from the acromion directly downwards. Inserted, tendinous, into a triangular rough sur- face on the outer side of the os humeri, near its middle. Situation: This muscle is entirely superficial, ex- cept where the thin fibres of the platysma myoides arise from its anterior surface. It arises from the same extent of bone as the trapezius is inserted into, and is therefore opposite to that muscle which passes upwards from its origin, while the deltoid runs downwards. It forms a strong coarse muscle, con- sisting of large fasciculi of fibres. It conceals the in- sertion of the pectoralis major, and the origins of the biceps flexor cubiti and coraco-brachialis, and covers the whole of the fore-part, and outside of the shoulder-joint. Its insertion is situated betwixt the biceps flexor cubiti and the short head of the triceps extensor, and immediately above the origin of the brachialis internus. Its external surface is quite fleshy; but, on cutting it across, its internal surface is found tendinous: and where it slides over the great tuberosity of the. humerus, there is a large bursa, or sacculus mucosus. From the insertion of the deltoid to the outer con- dyle of the OS humeri, is extended an Intermuscular Ligament, which separates the muscles on theante^ xior part of the arm from those the posterior part, aad_( 256 ) and gives attachment to the fibres of both. It is named the External Intermuscular Ligament. Use: To draw the arm directly upwards, and to move it a little forwards and backwards, according to the different directions of its fibres. Reflect it from the scapula and clavicle, that you may expose more completely the muscles on the dorsum of the former bone. Synonyma : Sous-acroniio-clavi-humeral. The following two muscles, which fill up the posterior surface of the scapula, are covered by a fascia, which adheres to the spine and edges of that bone. On dissecting off this fascia, the fleshy fibres of the muscles will be found arising from its inner surface. 2. The Supra Spinatus—Arises, fleshy, from all that part of the base of the scapula that is above its spine, from the superior costa as far forwards as the semilunar nitch, from the spine itself, and from the concavesurface betwixt it and the superior costa. The fleshy fibres, as they approach the neck of the scapula, terminate in a tendon which passes under the acromion, slides over the neck of the scapula, (to which it is connected by loose cellular membrane,) adheres to the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, and is Inserted into the anterior and superior part of the <Treat tuberosity near the head of the os humeri. Situation; This muscle fills up the fossa or cavity above the spine of the scapula, and is entirely con- cealed. Its belly is covered by the fibres of the tra- pezius( 257 ) pezius passing Into the spine of the scapula ; and its tendon passes under the deltoid. Use: To raise the arm. Synonyma: Super-scapularis:—Sus-spini-scapulo- trochiterien. 3. The Infra.Spinatos—Arises, principally fleshy, from the lower part of the spine of the sca- pula as far back as the triangular flat surface; from the base of the bone below the spine to near the in- ferior angle ; from the posterior ridge of the inferior costa; and from all the dorsum of the bone below the spine. The fibres ascend and descend towards a middle tendon, which runs forwards over the neck of the bone, and adheres to the capsular ligament. Inserted, by a strong short tendon, into the middle part of the great tuberosity of tlie os humeri. Situation : This muscle is in part concealed. The anterior part of its belly, and its tendinous insertion, are covered by the deltoid, and the trapezius passes over its upper and back-part, but a considerable por- tion of the belly of this muscle is seen betwixt these two muscles, and above the superior fibres of the latissimus dorsi. It is inserted below the tendon of the supra-spinatus. Use : To roll the humerus outwards, to assist in raising the arm, and in moving it outwards whea raised. Synonyma : Sus-spini-scapulo-trochiterien. 4. The Teres Minor—Arises, fleshy, from the narrow depression between the two ridges in the in- ferior costa of the scapula, extending from the neck of the bone to within an inch or two of the inferior angle.( 258 ) angle. It passes forwards along the inferior edge of the infra-spinatus, adheres to the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and is Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, into the lower and back-part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri. Situation : It is inserted below the tendon of the infra-spinatus. Its origin lies between the infra- spinatus and teres major, and is partly concealed by them. The middle of its belly is superficial, and not covered by any muscle ; but its insertion is concealed by the deltoid. The fascia which covers the infra- spinatus, envelopes also the teres minor; and the two muscles are, in some subjects, so closely united, as to be wiih difficulty separated. Use: To drav/ the humerus downwards and back- wards, and to roll it outwards. Synonyma : Margini-sus-scapulo-trochiterien. 5. The Teres Major—Arises, from an oblong, rough, flatted surface, at the inferior angle of the scapula. It forms a thick belly, which passes for- wards and upwards towards the inside of the arm. Inserted, by a broad thin tendon, into the ridge of the OS humeri, at the inner side of the groove for lodging the tendon of the long head of the biceps flexor cubiti. Situation : The origin of this muscle is superficial, and adheres to the lower fibres of the infra-spinatus. Its belly passes before the long head of the triceps extensor cubiti. Its tendon is inserted along with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. Observe the relative situation of these tendons; they both pass under the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps flexor, to( '^59 } to reach the place of their insertion, Tlicy appear at first inseparably united, but on dividing them with some care, we find an intermediate cavity lubricated with synovia. The tendon of the latissimus dorsi is anterior to the tendon of the teres major ; but the lower edge of the latter extends farther down the arm. Use: To roll the humerus inwards, and to dtaw it backwards and downwards. Synonyma : Anguli-scapulo-humeral. 6. The SuBSCAPULARis—^me*, fleshy, from all the baae of the scapula internally, from the superior and inferior costae, and from tlie whole internal sur- face of the bone. It consists of tendinous and fleshy bundles, which converge, slide over the inner surface of the neek of the scapula, pass in the hollow under the root of the coracoid process, and adhere to the inner part of the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint. Inserted, by a strong tendon, into the lesser tube- rosity near the head of the os humeri. Situation : The whole of this muscle is concealed by the scapula and muscles of the shoulder. It lies betwixt that bone and the serratus magnus. The tendon passes under the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps flexor, to reach the lesser tubero- sity : The lower edge of this muscle is in contact with the upper edge of tTie teres major. Use: To roll the os humeri inwards, and to draw it to the side of ^he body. Synonyma: Sus-scapulo-trochinien. 7. The Biceps Flexor Cubiti—Arises by two heads. The first and outermost, called the Long Head,( 260 ) Head, arises, by a strong tendon, trom a smootli sur- face in the upper edge of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It passes over the head of the os humeri, within the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and enters a groove betwixt the two tuberosities of that bone. It forms a strong fleshy belly. The second and innermost, called the Short Head, arises, tendinous, from the lower part of the coracoid pro- cess of the scapula, in common with the coraco- brachialis, and sends off a fleshy belly. These two fleshy bellies are at first only cor^iected by condensed cellular membrane. They form a thick mass; and, below the middle of the arm, become inseparably united. They send off a strong tendon, which is at first broad, but soon becomes rounder, and passes over the fore-part of the e]bow-joint. It then slides over the cartilaginous middle surface of the tubercle at the upper end of the radius, and is Inserted into the posterior and internal rough part of that^tubercle, A bursa mucosa is placed between the tendon and front of the tubercle. Situation : The tendon of the long head cannot be seen till the capsular ligament of the shoulder is open- ed: Where it runs in the groove of the os humeri, it lies betwixt the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, and is firmly bound down by tendinous fibres passing from the capsular ligament and adjacent tendons. The short head arises from the coracoid process, be- twixt the origin of the coraco-brachialis and the strong ligament which passes from the coracoid pro" cess to the acromion. These two origins ye conceal- ed by the deltoidesand pectoralis major. The belly of the 9 \i 261 ) the rnuscle is immediately under the integument*, and so is the tendon where it passes over the elbow- joint. It is seen tinking between the supinator radii longiis and pronator tores, to arrive at its point of insertion; and at the bend of the elbow, it sends off from its inside an aponeurosis, which assists in form- ing the fascia of the fore arm. Use : To turn the hand supine, to bend the fore- arm on the arm, and the arm on the shoulder. Si/iionyma : Biceps brachii;—Biceps, sive Coraco- radialis;—Biceps internus:— Scapulo-coraco-radial. 8. The CoRACO Brachialis—Arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the middle part of the apex of the coracoid processes of the scapula. Its fibres, as it de- scends, also arise from the edge of the short tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. It forms a flat fleshy belly which is always perforated by the nerve, named Musculo-Cutaneus; Inserted, tendinous and fleshy, about the middle of the internal part of the os humeri, into a rough ridge. Situation: This muscle is much connected with the short head of the biceps flexor cubiti. It arises be- twixt that muscle and the origin of the pectoralis mi- nor. In the arm, it lies behind, and on the inside of tlie biceps, and is concealed by the pectoralis major and deltoides, excepting'a small part of it which is feeen projecting betwixt the biceps flexor and triceps extensor cubiti. It is inserted immediately below the tendons of the Intissimus dorsi and teres major, and before the brachialis externus. The lower part of its( 262 ) its insertion passes betwixt the bracliialis internum and brachialis externus. Tlie internal intermuscular ligament is seen ex- tending from the lower part of this muscle along a ridge to the internal condyle, and separating the brachialis internus from the brachialis externus, or third head of the triceps extensor cubiti. Use : To move the arm upwards and forwards. Synonyma: Coraco-humeral. 9. The Brachialis Internus—Arises, from the middle of the os humeri, by two fleshy slips, which pass on each side of the insertion of the del- toid muscle ; fleshy from all the fore-part of the bone below, nearly as far as the condyles. The fibres con- verge, pass over the elbow-joint, and adhere to the capsular ligament. Inserted, by a strong short tendon, into the rough surface immediately below the coronoid process of the ulna. Situation : The most external of the fleshy slips of this muscle lies between the deltoid and short head of the triceps extensor, the internal between the deltoid and coraco-brachialis. The belly is almost entirely concealed by the biceps flexor cubiti, excepting a small portion which projects beyond the outer edge of that muscle. The tendon dips down betwixt the supinator radii longus and pronator teres, crosses under the tendon of the biceps flexor, and is inserted on the inside of that tendon. Use : To bend the fore-arm. Synonyma: Brachiseus ;—Humero-cubital. 10. The 8( 263 ) its 10. The TniCEPS Extensor Cubiti is the great muscle which covers all the back-part of the arm It arises by three heads. The first, or long liead, (irises, by a broad tendon, from the inferior , costaof the scapula near its cervix, and forms a large belly, which covers the back-part of the os humeri. The second, or short head> arises, on the outer and back-part of the os humeri, by an acute tendinous and fleshy beginning, from a ridge which runs from the back-part of the great tuberosity towards the outer condyle. The fibres begin to arise a little be- low the tuberosity, and are continued down to the condyle. They also arise from the surface of bone behind the ridge, and from the intermuscular liga- ment which separates them from the muscles on the fore-part of the arm. The third head, called Bra- CHiALis ExTERNus, arises, by an acute beginning, from the inside of the os humeri above its middle, and from a ridge extending to the inner condyle. It also arises from the surface behind this ridge, and from the internal intermuscular ligament. The three heads unite above the middle of the os humeri, and invest the whole back-part of the bone. They form a thick strong tendon, which is Inserted into the rough back-part of the process of the ulna, called Olecranon, and partly into the con- dyles of the OS humeri, adhering firmly to the cap- sular ligament. Situation: The long head, where It arises from the scapula, is concealed by the deltoid; it arises betwixt the teres minor and teres major, and passes betwixt those muscles to the arm; and,in the remainder of( 2G4. ) . its course, is superficially seated. The short head arises immediately below the insertion of the teres minor, its upper part is therefore covered by the deltoides. Below the deltoid, it is superficial, and arises more outwardly than the brachialis intern us, supinator radii longus, and extensors of the carpus. The brachialis externus is situated immediately un- der the integuments; it begins to arise below the in- sertion of the teres major. It passes down the arm between the triceps longus, and coraco-brachialis at first, afterwards between the triceps longus and bra- chialis internus. The tendon of the triceps sends ofiF a thin fascia, which covers the triangular surface of the ulna, on which we commonly lean. Numerous fibres are also sent off, to assist in forming the fascia of the fore-arm. Use: To extend the fore-arm. Tlie long head will also assist in drawing the arm backwards.

This i'ascia is continued iVoni the inter- muscular ligaments which pass down to the condyles of the OS humeri. It is atlac!u?d to the condyles, and it adheres firmly to the olecranon of the ulna. It re- ceives, on the- posterior i)nrt, a great addition oClibres from tlie tendon of the triceps extensor ; and on the fore-part of the arm, it appaars to he a continuation of the aponeurosis which is sent oH'lVom the biceps tlcxor cubiii. Above the fascia, we meet witl; several cutaneous veins and nerves The veins liave been alread}' de- scribed ; the nerves are twigs of the brandies of the brachial plexus. The rebttive situation of the vessels at the bend of the arm should be well attended to. Tiic cutaneoui veins situated here vary much in size. The vena ba- silica is seen running over the fore-part of the bend of the arm near the inner condyle, the vena cephalica situated near the outer condyle; and each of these veins receives a branch passing obliquely from ths vena mediana major. 'J'hese vessels lie,above the fas- cia, while the brachial artery lies deep boncath the fascia, in a holiow resembling that of the axilla. It descends over the joint near the inner condyle, on the Ii-iside of the tendon of th^ biceps flexor cubiti, and under the aponeurosis sent ofFfrom that muscle to the common fascia of the fore-arm. It lies embedded in cellular substance, betwixt the pronator teres and flexor muscles of the wrist and fingers on one side, and the supinator longus and extensor muscles o\\ the TOther. Ill this hollow, it divides into the radial ul.i t66 ) ttar, and interosscal arteries. The artery is accompa-. nicd by two veinsj and on its inner side runs the ra- dial nerve. The dissection of the fascia of the fore-arm is simi- lar to that of the fascia of the leg. It is found firmly attached to the fibres of the muscles, so that the ex- posed surface appears ragged. It sends down betwixt them partitions, named Intermuscular Ligaments or Tendons, which connect the muscles, and give origin to many of their fibres. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE FCRE-FAIIT OF THE CUBIT, AND ARISING FUOM THE INNER CON- DYLE OF THE OS HUMLUL These are eight in number, and may be divided into two classes; the superficial, and the deep-seated. First, The superficial. All the muscles passing from the inner condyle, may be said to arise by one common tendinous head fi'om the condyle; and this head may be said to divide into the diiTcrent muscles; but they will be here de- scribed as arising distinct from the condyle. It must, howevei*, be recollected, that their origins are inti- mately connected by intermuscular ligaments, and that they cannot be separated without dividing some of their fibres. 1. The Pro.vator Radii Teres—.-^r/ic.?, ten- di'nous and fleshy, from the anterior surface of thein- ner condyle of thp os humeri, and from the Coronoid process ot the ulna.

Tlie fibres pnai; outvvard;^, run by the side of the tubercle of the radius, and pass over the outer edge of that bone, to be Inserted, tendinous and flesliy,into a rough surface on the back-part of the radius about its middle. Situation: Of thcmuscles which passfromthe inter- nal condyle, the pronator teres is situated nearest the outer edge of tlie arm. It lies immediately on the inside of the tendon of the brachialis internus. Its tendon, to arrive at its place of insertion, passes under the belly of the supinator longus, and, when that muscle is removed, will be found inserted into the ra- dius immediately below the supinator brevis. Use : To roll the radius, together with the handy inwards. Synonyma : Pronator teres, give Obliquu3 ;—Epi- trochlo-radial. 2.

The Superficial; and, 2. The deep-seated. THE SUPERFICIAI/^. The muscles which arise from the outer condyle are much more distinct in their origins than those which arise from the inner condyle. Several of them arise a considerable way up the os humeri; but there is here also a common tendinous origin, from which the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor digito. rum communis, and extensor carpi radialis, proceed; so that these muscles are intimately connected. 1. Supinator Radii Longus—Arises, tendi- nous and fleshy, from the external ridge of the os- humeri which leads to the outer condyle. It begin* to arise nearly as far up as the middle of the bone, and ceases to adhere about two.inches above the con- M o dyle.I 274, ) dyle. It forms a thick fleshy belly, which passes over the side of the elbow-joint, becomes smaller, and terminates above the middle of the fore-arm in a flat tendon. Ihe tendon becomes gradually rounder, and is Inserted into a rough surface on the outer side of the inferior extremity of the radius. Situation: This muscle is situated immediately under the integuments along the outer edge of the arm and fore-arm. It begins to arise from the os humeri im^mediately belov?^ the insertion of the del- toid. Its origin lies betwixt the brachialis internus and short head of the triceps extensor cubiti, from which it is separated by the external intermuscular ligament. It descends along the radius, placed at first between the extensor carpi radialis longior and pronator teres, lower down between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor radialis lon- gior.

General Observations,—In dissecting the fore-arm, you will not expect to find each muscle separate fi-om the contiguous ones, as far as its very origin from tlie bones. The partitions of fascia unite them most firmly to a considerable distance from their commencement: and these connections should not be disturbed, since they are as justly to be regarded in the light of the origins of the muscles, as the attacii:. meats( 282 ) ments wliich tlic fibres have to the bone. The rnus- cles arc divided into two masses ; of which one lies over the radius and back of the fore-arm, and con- tains the supinators and extensors : the other, situ- ated over the ulna, and inner side of the fore-arm, consists of the pronators and flexors. Although some muscles in each of these masses arise quite separate- ly, others are joined into a common tendinous and fleshy origin, in the way above described. First clear all the muscles as they lie ; and after observing them in their relative position, reflect each muscle, beginning with the superficial ones, and reading its description at the same time. SECT. III. DissErnox of the palm of T[ie hand, The tendons which pass over the bones of the carpus into the palm of the hand are firmly bound down by the annular ligament of the wrist. They are invested and connected by cellular mt-mbrane, which forms sheaths, and secretes synovia to facili- tate their motions. In the sole of the foot we'saw a strong fascia, sup- porting and covering the muscles, and passing from the heel to the toss. On removing the integuments from the palm of the hand, we meet with a similar fascia. It arises from the tendon of the palmaris longus, and from the annular ligament of the wrist. expands( 28S ) expands over all the palm of ihc liancl, and is fixed' to the roots of the fingers, splitting to transmit their tendons. This is the Fascia or Aponeurosis Palmaris. It is triangular. Where it arises from the urist, it is narrow, and does not cover the bases of the metnrcarp:il bones of the little and fore fingir.— As it runs over tlic hand, it becomes broader, and is fixed by a bifurcated extremity in the lower end of each of the metarcarpal bones of the four fingers. — 'J'he piilmar fascia is strong and thicic, conceals and supports the muscles of the hand, and may be dis- tinguished into ibur portions, which are connected by transverse fibres, v/hile other fibres pass from them downwards, adheres strongly to the edges of the metacarpal bones, and separate the tendons of each finger. . There is a small thin cutaneous muscle~"situated between the wrist and the little finger. The Palmauis Brevis—Arises from the annu- lar ligament of the wrist, and from the inner edge of the fascia palmaris. Insei-ted, by small scattered fibres, into the skin and fat which covers the short muscles of the little finger and inner edge of the hand. Use: To assist in contracting the palm of the hand. ^ Synovijmn: Palmaris cutaneous. The fascia palmaris may now be removed. Under it will be seen the four tendons of the flexor sublimig perforatus. I'hey are seen coming from beneath the annular ligament of the wrist, and diverging as they pass( !2.vl. ) pass towards their respective fingers. Each tendorr splits at the extremity of the first pluilanx, for the passage of the tendon of the flexor profundis per- foratus, and inserted into the base af the second phalanx. Under the flexor subHmis are the four tendons of" the flexor profundus pcrforans, which pass through the shts in tlie tendons of the former, and are in- serted into the bases of the third phakmges of the fingers. The LuMEniCALEs are four small muscles, whicit arise, tendinous and flesliv, fron) the outer side of thv* tendons cf the flexor profLUiduu pcrforans, soon after those tendons have passed the ligavnentum cnrpl annulare. Each of the«e musch.'s has a small belly, which terminates in a tendon. The tendon run» along the outer edge of the finger, and is Inserted into the tendinous expansion \Yhich covers, the back-part of the phalanges of the fingers, about the middle of the first joint. Use: To bend the first phalanges of the fingers, the flexor profundus being previously in action, to afi'ord them a fixed point. Synonyma: Annuli-tcndino-phalangiens.

OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREiNiriT. ARTERIES. The subclavian and axillary arteries have been described. The Brachial Artery may be said to have it» course along the inside of the arm. Having left the axilla,' »( 291 ) axilla, it runs along the inferior edge of the cAraco- brachiulis. Rather higher up than the middle of the oshuinen, it crosses over the tendinous insertion of that nniscle, being here situated between the bell)' o^ the biceps flexor cubiti, and the superior fibres of the brachiulis extenius. The artery then passes behind the inner edge of the biceps flexor cubiti, descending betwixt that muscle and the fibres of the brachialis iatcrnus. In dissecting this vessel, we find it invested by ii fascia or sheath, formed by cellular membrane and some tendinons fibres. This fascia may be traced extending from the internal intermuscular ligam|nt. It covers the brachial artery and radial nerve; and the great basilic vein, as it enters into the axilla, is found lying in the fore and inner part of this sheath. It supports and connects these ves- sels. On dissecting this fascia, we find, close to the margin of the coraco-brachialis and biceps flexor cubiti, the great radial nerve : under it the brachial artery ; and, more superficially seated, the venae co- miies and the venabasilica. As the artery approaches the lower extremity of the os humeri, it inclines for- wards toward the fold of the arm, and dives beneath the aponeurosis which arises from the inside of the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti. Its situation at the fold of the arm has been described. BRANCHES OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 1. A. Profunda Humeri Superior, or Mus- cularis Superior, is sent off from the inner side of the brachial artery, immediately where it has left the fold of the arm-pit. It passes downwards and back- ■wards round the os humeri, and is accompanied by N 2 the( 29i ) is distributed over the anterior part of the outer con- dyle, where it anastomoses with branches of the bra- chial artery. (2.) Small arteries to the muscles of the fore-arm, and to the radius. (3.) A branch leaves the artery immediately after it Jias turned over the edge of the radius, and, ramifying on the back of the hand, is named Dorsalis Carpi. (4.) Small vessels are sent off to the back-part of the thumb, named A. Dorsales Pollicis. Having reached tlie palm of the hand, the radial artery divides into tAvo branches. (1.) A. Pollicis, which sends two or three arteries along tlie anterior part of the thumb, and also often gives off a twig, the A. Radialis Indicis, which passes along the outer edge of the fore-finger, and inoscu- lates with a branch of the ulnar artery. (li.) The trunk of the radial artery forms the Deep-seated Palmar Arch. From the root of tlie thumb, it passes across the nietacarpalbones near their bases, and terminates at the metacarpal bone of the little finger, inosculating with a branch of the ul- nar artery. This arch lies deep, close'to the bones. It supplies the interosseous muscles and deep-seated parts of the palm, and some of its branches pass betwixt the. metacarpal bones to the back of the hnnd. 2. A UTERI A Ulnar IS, or Cubitalis. The ulnar artery is the largest branch of the brachial, and gene- rally gives off the interosseous artery. It takes its course deep among the muscles on the inside of the fore-arm. It is seen passing under tliepronator teres, iicxor carpi radialis, paluiaris longus, and fle.xor sub- limis( 295 ) llrais perforatus, but over tlic flexor profundus per- forans. It descends in the connecting cellular mem- brane, between the flexor sublirais and prol'undus; but about the middle of the lore-arm, it emerges from these muscles, and appears at the ulnar edge of the arm, betwixt the flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris. It passes over the annular ligament of the wrist, which binds down the flexor tendons of the fmgers, but is covered by the fascia which ties down the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It passes un- der the palmar aponeurosis, on the inside of the og pisiforme, reaches the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and begins to form the Supeh- nciAL Palmar Arch. This arch Hes above the tendons of the flexor sublimis perforatus, immedi- ately beneath the palmar aponeurosis. It crosses tlie metacarpal bones betwixt their bases and the middle of their bodies. It begins at the root of the little finger, and terminates at the root of the thumb, in inosculations with the branches of the radial ar- tery. The convex side of the arch is turned to- wards the fingers, and sends off five branches. (1.) A branch to tlie muscles and inner edge of the little fing6r. (2.) Ramus digitalis primus, or the first digital ar- tery, which runs along the space betwixt the two last metacarpal bones, and bifurcates into two branches, one to the outside of the little finger, and the other to the inner side of the ring-finger. (3.) The second digital artery, which bifurates in a similar manner, and supplies the outer edge of the ring-finger, and the inner side of the middle finger. (^O The third digital artery, which is distributed to( 296 ) to the outer edge of the middle finger, and to the inner side of the fore fingt-r. (5.) The ramus Pollicis uhiaris is the last branch of the ulnar artery, and is sent to the muscles of the thumb. From the concavity of the arch are sent off the interosseous arteries of the palm, small twigs which iupply the deep-seated parts, and perforate betwixt the metacarpal bones to the back of the hand. The brunches of the ulnar artery, in its course along the fore-arm and wrist, are the following. (1.) The Recurrent Arteries are two in number. They are sent off from the ulnar artery im- mediately below the elbow, sometimes in one common branch, which subdivides. The anterior recurrent runs over the fore part of the inner condyle; the pos- terior recurrent passes over the back-part. These arteries inosculate v/ith branches of the brachial. (2.) Tw]gs to the muscles of the fore-arm. (3.) A. Dorsalis Carpi is sent off from the ulnar artery a little above the wrist to the back of the Iiand. Twigs are also given off to the annular liga- ment and neighbouring parts. (4-.'» A. Palmaris Profunda is sent off from the Ulnar artery, where it descends on the inside of the OS pisiforme. It passes into the flesh at the root of the little finger, and inosculates with the termination of the deep-seated palmar arch of the radial artery. 3. Arteria Interossea, (or Intcrrossea Com- munis). This artery is generally sent off from the ulnar. It immediately divides into two branches : (1.) The external or posterior interosseous artery is the smallest branch. It passes through the upper , ' part( 297 ) ^lai t ot'tlic interosseous ligaiuerU, l.o supply ihc nni.^- cles on the posterior part of the ibrecann. It sends off the.A. Kecurrens Intero.sse;>., wiiich rmnifies on tlie micUlle of tlie back-part of tlie elbow-joint. ('_'.) Tiie internal or anterior interosseous artery tlejcends close upon tlie middle of tlie interosseous li- gament, betwixt the flexor longus poUicis and flexor profundus perforans, giving twigs to tlic adj.icent nniscles. Arriving at the up])cr edge of the pronator qiiadratus, it perforates betwixt the radius ani ulna to the back-part of the arm, and spreads its extreme jbrnnches on the wrist and back of the hand. VEINS. The cutaneous veins have been already described. The brachial arterj' is accompanied by tivo veins, named Venae Comites, or Satellites. These i-eceive branches corresponding to the ramificatious of the artery. NERVES. In the dissection of the asilla, we demonstrated thft greataxillary plexus, and traced its two fia-st branches, the external scapular and circumflex nerves. Tlie distribution of the five remaining branches of the plexus must now be described. .-. (3.) The External CiT'fAyKOUs Nerve, (Mus- Cufo-cutaneus, or Perforans Casscrii,) is the third branch of the axillary plexus. It passes through the ])clly of the caraco-brachiatis muscle. Alter its pas- sage it continues its course obliquely across the arm, betwixt the Biceps flexor cnbiti and the Brachialis internus. It gives twigs to these muscles, and appears as a superficial nerve on the edge of the supinator longus. It runs over the cute- 'Condyle, and is dis- tributetl( 298 ) tnbuted to the integuments on the outside of the fore-arm, and back of the hand. (4.) The Radial (or Median) Nerve accompa- nies the brachial artery to the bend of the elbow, and is contained in the same sheath as the artery. In its passage down the arm, it lies before that vessel, but at the elbow is situated on its inside. It gives off no branches until it has sunk under the aponeurotic ex- pansion of the biceps flexor. Here it distributes many nerves to the muscles of the fore-arm, to the prona- tor teres, flexor carpi radialis, the flexors of the thumb and fingers, and the pronator quadratus. The trunk of the nerve perforates the pronator teres, passes betwixt the flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor profundus, and continues its course betwixt these muscles down to the wrist. Near the wrist it becomes more superficial, lying amongst the ten- dons of the flexors, and before it descends under the annular ligament, sends a superficial branch to the integuments and short muscles of the thumb. The nerve itself passes with the flexor tendons of the fin- gers under the annular ligament of the wrist, emerge* from these tendons, and appears on their outside, near the root of the thumb. It ramifies superficially in the hand, setting off four branches. The first branch passes to the thumb; the second to the side of the fore-finger next the thumb ; the third divides into two nerves, of which one passes to the inner side of tiie fore-finger ; the fourth also subdivides into twof to the inside of the middle finger, and outer side of the ring finger. These nerves pass before the flexor tendons, but behind the superficial palmer arterial arch, to reach the finsxers. (5.) The( 29!) ) {3.) The Ulnar Neuve desceiuls along tlio inside of the arm. It is at first situated immediatuly under the integuments, but below the middle of the arm Is tied down by the intermuscular ligament which passes to the inner condyle of the humerus. The nerve be- comes here more deeply seated ; it runs between the inner condyle in the hollow behind it and the olecra- non, and in the flesh of the brachialis externus, or third head of the triceps extensor. After passing the condyle, it continues its course betwixtthe two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, till it reaches the ulnar artery. It then accompanies the ulnar artery, lying on its inside, and running along the fore-arm betwixt the flexor ulnaris and flexor digitorum sublimis. It sends twigs to the neighbouring muscles, and, when arrived near the wrist, divides into two branches. 1. The Smaller Branch, called liamus posticus, passes under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and over the lower end of the ulna, to be distributed to the back of the hand, and of tlie little and rin.? fingers. 2. The continued trunk of the nerve passes, on the inside of the ulnar artery, over the annular li- gament of tlie wrist. It passes under the palmar apo- neurosis, and divides into three principal branches. The first supplies the integuments and muscles on the ulnar edge of the hand, and the inner side of the little finger. The second is distributed to the outer side of the little finger, and inner side of the ring-finger. The third branch passes deep under the long tendons, accompanies the deep-seated palmar arch, and ter- minates in the short muscles of the thumb and fore- finger, communicating M'ith the radial nerve. (6,) The MuscuiAu or Si'IRAl Nekve (Ra- JJIAI,( 300 ) DIAL of some aiiatomiits) passes from the axilla . beliind the OS humeri, making a spiral I urn round the bone to reach t!ie outside of the arm. It first descends between the brachialis externus and s])ort head of tlie biceps extensor cubiti, accompanying the arteria profunda humeri superior, and passing deep into the flesh of the arm. Before it makes this turn, it gives branches to the muscles, also a cuta- neous branch, which descends on the mside of the arm. From the back-part of the arm the great trunk of the nerve is reflected spirally forw ards. It is seen emerging betwixt the supinator longus and brachialis internus, seateddeep and close to the bone. It descends betwixt these muscles, keeping close to the edge of the supinator longus. Immediately after passing the fol'd of the arm, it sends off a nerve, which descends, superficial, upon theradialedgc of the fore- arm, as far as the wrist; and, at this point, the trunk of the muscular nerve divides itself into twobranchcs. The first, a large branch, perforates the supinator brevis, and supplies the extensor muscles of the hand and fingers. The second branch accompanies the su- pinator longus down the'fore arm, and near tlie wrist turns under the tendon of that muscle, over the edge of the radius. It then divides into several branches which ramify on the back of the wrist, thumb, and fore-finger. (7.) The Internal Cutaneous Nerve de- scends, superficial, along the inside of the arm and fore-arm. It was described among the cutaneous nerves of the arm. riiutcd R. and R IttCEREbiOH ( F BooTLr- \y v.mnn (Hfifcrfi^'^St Jtl^j^^c larc, London. AND ^,U5LU{»«.MEDICAL BOOKS, PUBLISHED BY J.

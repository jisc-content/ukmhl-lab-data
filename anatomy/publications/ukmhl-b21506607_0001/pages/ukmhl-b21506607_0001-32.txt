They are thought bj some to possess the characteristics of con- nective-tissue corpuscles; others believe them to be only amoeboid lymph-corpuscles; while still others believe them to be peripheral nerve-corpuscles in com- munication, by their deep processes, with fine filaments of the superficial cutaneous nerves. The covering of the skin, being composed of nume- rous layers of cells superimposed upon each other, mainly of a flattened scaly form, is termed a stratified squamous epithelium. THE EPITHELIUM OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES. Squa'iaous tinihelium.—In the mouth of man, the epithelial covering of the mucous membrane is nearly identical with that which covers and protects the skin. The stratum granulosum and the stratum lucidum, however, are absent. Moreover, because of the con- stant moist condition of the epithelial layers upon this mucous membrane, the corneous layer of cells is comparatively thin, and is composed of thin scales in which small nuclei may be seen. The deep layer of columnar cells is but little pigmented. Some later histologists note, throughout mucous membranes and the small accessory glands attached thereto, the exist- ence of a single layer of flat endothelial cells, between Fig. 14.

BLOOD. 29 after the addition of ether is set aside for a day or two, there is found at the bottom of the vessel a deposit which consists of lympii-corpuscles and minute gran- ules. The latter have retained their original globular or angular shape, have become more translucent, and have been entirely deprived of their fat. BLOOD. Like the lymph, the blood, when naturally flowing, consists of a colorless transparent fluid plasma, in which freely float numerous and varied minute ani- mal forms. The proportion of the volume of these form-elements to that of the plasma is about as fol- lows: In 1000 parts of blood there are— Water Globules . Proteid substances Fatty matter and salts 790. 127. 73. 10. Besides the fluids and solids above enumerated, the blood is always more or less charged with gases, of which carbonic acid, oxygen, and nitrogen are the chief. The capacity of the blood for the absorption of oxygen is peculiarly great, being more than eight times that of water. "Whilst the oxygen of the blood is almost, if not quite, exclusively held in the red corpuscles, the carbonic acid is united with the plasma. Number and size of red corpuscles. — By far the most numerous and most important form-element of the blood of vertebrate animals is the red blood-cor- puscle, or red blood-disk. We learn from the enume- ration of Malassez, that in cartilaginous fishes the number of these elements ranges from 140,000 to 230,000 per .03937 cubic inch (a cubic millimetre); in the osseous fishes the number varies between 700,000 and 2,000,000 per cubic millimetre. The same in- vestigator places the number of these corpuscles per c. m. in birds at 1,600,000 to 4,000,000, while the ex- treme numbers per c. m. in the mammiferae are recorded at 3,500,000 and 18,000,000. We have the authority of the same writer for the statement that the mean volume of the corpuscles is almost always in inverse ratio to their numbers. This proposition is not abso- lute, however, for a small number of the colored corpuscles may not be entirely compensated by an increase in the volume of the corpuscle. By consulting Fig. 7 and the table subjoined, the enormous difference in size, as well as in shape, of the colored corpuscles of the blood of different vertebrate animals can be readily appreciated. It will be noticed that the long axis of the red corpuscle of the proteus is recorded in the table as j^-g- of an inch, a magni- tude sufficiently large to be appreciated by the naked eye under favorable circumstances. Yet the colored blood-disk of the Amphiuma (Congo eel) is quite one- third larger still. Fig. 7. All the corpuscles here shown are ilrawn to the uniform scale, at the bottom of the wood-cut, of 1—1000th of an English inch, and the measurements are expressed in vulgar fractions of that inch. t. n. signifies transverse diameter; L. D. long diameter; s. d. short diameter. {Gulliver.) Mammalia. T. D. I.. D. S. D. 1. Red Corpuscle of Man, seen on the flat surface and also on the edge; thickness 1-12400 .... 1-3200 2.

The counts of the corpuscles made upon the blood of the same individual appear to vary considerably, according to the location whence the blood is obtained. It seems, however, to be pretty well established that in any portion of the economy where there is a con- densation of the plasma of the blood by loss of fluid.

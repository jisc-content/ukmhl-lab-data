The labors of the American editor, Dr. Hartshorne, have been very conscientiously performed, and his judicious notes distributed throughout, afford abundant evidence of the thoroughness of the revision at his hands. In conclusion, we take pleasure in commending this work to our readers, feeling coniident that it will not only become standard, but from its containing just that information which the busy practitioner frequently finds himself in need of, from its completeness, its fulness of detail, and its excellence, it will bs justly ap- preciated by the entire profession on this continent.—SowMec», rrnc/ilioner, Api'il, 1880. For conciseness and comprehensiveness in the treatment of all the subjects embraced under the head of "Practice of Medicine," there is no work in the English language, or in any other language, for that matter, which equals, much less excels, Reynolds' System. Each volume contains a complete index, a feature which those who may have encyclopaedic works of medicine not containing this index can fully appreciate.—Michigim Medical News, June 10, 1880. We regard this the finest work on the practice of medicine in the English language. In fact, we do not think it has its superior in any language in the world. Combining, as it does, a complete history of diseases, a thorough account of their [lathology, a full description of therapeutics, and a minute detail of treatment, etc., it embodies all that a practitioner can wish.—Cincivnati Medical Times, August 1880.

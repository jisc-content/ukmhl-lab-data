On the right the limits of the sejiaratc cells with their nuclei are exhibited somewhat diatrrammatically. {Gray.) muscle is cut transverse to the direction of the muscle-fibres, instead of the cross-section of the fibre presenting a circular outline, as in ordinary striped muscle, it is often elongated. This is the case when the cut has passed through the body of the fibre uear the point where it branches. Becauae of the extreme shortness of the branched muscle-fibres almost every one of them in the cross-section is seen to contain near its centre a muscle-corpuscle. Termination of musclefiJ>res. â€” As has already been mentioned, each individual muscle-fibre termi- nates in a tapering conical extremity. Whether these extremities end in tendon, or in the depth or body of the muscle, in the endoinysium between the muscle-fibres of the primary bundles, they are at- tached to connective-tissue fibres (<, 2, fig. 1, Plate VI.). It seems to be still unsettled exactly how this connection is established. Unless the tissue is especially prepared for exami- nation, the longitudinal fibrillge appear to be directly continuous at their extremity with the connective- fibres, and the one seems to pass insensibly into the other. Perhaps such a simple connection may really exist in many instances; but it is probable that, in most cases, where muscle is inserted into tendon, there is a different mode of communication. The sarco- lemma probably continues withoutinterruption around the conical end of the muscle-fibre, and at this point is attached by its external surface to the bundles of fibrous tissue which form the tendon.

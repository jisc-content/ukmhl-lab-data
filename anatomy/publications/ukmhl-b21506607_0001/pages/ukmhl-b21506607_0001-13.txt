ANATOMICAL NOMENCLATURE. — S.OO§§OOC 21 vertebral canal becomes the neural space, and the cavity of the thorax the hemal space. Anything toward the neural space becomes neurad; and any- thing toward the hemal space becomes hemad, etc. Ventral and dorsal are terms nearly equal in value to those just given. They more commonly relate to surfaces. Huxley proposes the terms epi-axial and hypo-axial to designate the relation of parts to any given axis, either of the trunk or of the limbs. According to tliis method, the longissimus dorsi muscle is epi-axial to the axis of the spine, while the psoas muscle is hypo-axial to it. The biceps cubiti muscle is epi-axial, the triceps is hypo-axial, etc. In making these dis- tinctions the body is assumed to be prone or supine. The terms pre-axial and post-axial may be substi- tuted for the foregoing in studying a body, like that of man, in the erect position. In the naming of organs, it must be acknowledged that little order exists in the employment of terms. The terms are often inappropriate, cumbersome in form, and vague in meaning. They are as likely as not to be applied in a manner at variance with their legitimate use. Authors have multiplied terms to such a degree that there are but few structures which are designated by a single name ; and since no cus- tom has fixed the choice to be made in such sy- nonymy, clinical writers are perhaps excusable in consulting their own convenience. Whenever prac- ticable, the terminology used by clinical writers will be preferred throughout this treatise. .Femurs will have " heads" and " necks," and convolutions will continue to " ascend" or " descend," as long as prac- tical physicians employ these words in recording their cases. With a view of preventing confusion, the more common of the synonymous terms will be placed in brackets after those adopted by the author. The significance of anatomical terms not in general use is fully exhibited in works readily accessible to the student.

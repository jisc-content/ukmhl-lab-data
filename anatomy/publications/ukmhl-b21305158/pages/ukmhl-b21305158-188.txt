DISSECTION ov THE MUSCLES ON THE FORE PART OF THE NECK. The ruTYSMA myoides is the first muscle to be dis- sected. The fibres of this muscle are frequently so thin and indistinct, that a student will find it sometimes diffi- cult to expose them, particularly as they have neither origin nor insertion in bone. A block of wood should be put under the shoulders,, and the head should be fixed by a chain-hook to the table, so as to make the fibres of the superficial layer of the muscles tense. * An incision should then be made through the skin only, from midway between the chin and the ear, to about three fingersâ€™ breadth from the sternal end of the clavicle. This incision will expose the fibres of the platysma, about their middle. The dissection should be continued, by cutting in the same line, first to- wards the larynx, and then towards the back part of the neck. In dissecting towards the fore part, the fibres of the sterno hyoideus will probably be in part exposed ; and towards the back part, the fibres of the sterno cleido masloideus will appear under the fascia, or condensed cellular membrane, in which the fibres of the platysma terminate. The platysma may be cut across, about its middle. The lower half is then to be carried towards the chest, by which we shall expose the fibres of the sterno cleido masloideus; but in doing this, we should begin at the inner angle of the flap, and dissect in an oblique direction. * Previous to the dissection of these muscles, the student should particularly examine the os hyoides, and the external cartilages of the larynx.

107 The Ligaments which are generally enumerated, are : — (externally.) 1. Ligamenlum Capsulare. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Patellce. Laleralc Externum Longum. Breve. Internum. Pop l it ale. (internally ) 1. Ligamenlum Alare Externum. 2. 3- 4. 5. 6. 7. Internum, jyiucosum. Crucia/e Anticum. Poslicum. (When the bones are separated.) Coranarium. Transvtrsale. 8. 9. 10. 11. The four Oblique. When we remove the muscles of the leg, we shall find, that the tibia and fibula are bound very strongly together by the interosseous ligament; butatthe upper and lower ^eads, we shall also find regular capsules, and strengthen- iing ligaments. At the upper head, there are two acces- sory ligaments, one of which is on the fore part, the other !behind ; they are called Ligamenlum Capitulce Fibula; An- ■ licum et Ligamenlum Capilulce Fibula; Posticum ; at the lower head, they also receive similar names : but we may •remark, that in consequence of the inferior ligaments be- ing divided by cellular membrane, and vessels, which pass through the middle of them, some authors have been in- duced to describe two before, and two behind,—thus (there would be a Ligamenlum Anticum superius, and iLigamenlum Anticum inferius,—and on the back part, iLigamentum Poslicum superius, and Ligamenlum Poslicum i inferius. As the ankle joint is nearly a simple hinge joint, the i principal ligaments must be lateral; but, as in this joint, fthe form of the bones is not very well adapted for check- ing its motions of flexion and extension, there is a neces- sity for more ligaments, than those merely for the purpose of lateral motion. The ligamenlum capsulare is very thin i in this joint, but it is strengthened by the ligamentous bbands which keep the tendons of the muscles in their pproper positions; but both these, and the capsular liga- ment, must be removed, before we can see the proper liga-

210 DISSECTION O T THE ARTERIES or THE SHOULDER AND ARM, In the first dissection of these arteries, they should be injected; and, that all the vessels of the shoulder may be seen, the injection should Be made in the same manner as that described at p. 225. It may be done from the sub- clavian artery ; or from the axillary, after the arm is re- moved from the body : but iu either of these methods, a great many vessels must necessarily be destroyed. The manner of dissecting the arteries which arise from the subclavian, has already been described at page 228 ; so we may now pass to the description of the branches which arise from the artery, after it has passed under the.cla- vicle;—and first, of that division of the artery, which i« j called the axillary. The pectoralis major, the deltoid, and the latissimu* dorsi, should be dissected iu the manner recommended in the dissection of the muscles, at page 181 ; but in doing this, we must take care to avoid the small branches, w hich will be found on removing the cellular membrane. If we are dissecting a female subject, in which the breasts are enlarged, or where milk has lately been secreted, we shall find upon the surface of the pectoralis major, a great many arteries passing to the mamma. Between the deltoid and pectoralis, we shall see arteries running down, and a vein passing up ;—the arteries are

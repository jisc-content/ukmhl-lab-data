24 duced by the neck of the sac,—the danger of reducing the serum iu the sac, and leaving the intestine still stran- gulated,—those changes which take place in the gut producing strangulation,—the difference between strangu- lation and incarceration,—the circumstances which render an artificial anus necessary,—or what is to be done for the renewal of the course of the faeces. Some examples illus- trative of these questions, will be found in a paper written by me, in the sixth number of the Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine and Surgery, February, 1820. The books on hernia I need hardly point out; but prejudice in favour of the history of operations in which I have per- sonally assisted, leads me to direct the student’s attention particularly to the cases which are related by Mr. Charles Bell. I shall now proceed to describe the dissection of the viscera of the abdomen, which I have already said ought to be made before the young student can attend, with advantage, to the subject of hernia. FIRST VIEW OF THE VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. The first general view of the visdera may be taken from the body on which the muscles have been dissected. Before exposing the cavity of the abdomen, the stu- dent should attend to those arbitrary divisions which have been called the Regions of the Abdomen. To mark these, one line should be drawn across the abdomen, between the most prominent parts of the cartilages of the ribs, and another between the superior spinous processes of the ilia. These lines will divide the belly into three parts, each of which is subdivided. The space above the middle line includes the epigastric and the right and left hypo- chondriac regions,—the cartilages of the ribs form the lateral boundaries of the epigastric region, the centre and upper part of which is often called scrobiculus cordis. If we take the umbilicus for a centre, and describe a circle, the radius of which extends to the upper and lower line.

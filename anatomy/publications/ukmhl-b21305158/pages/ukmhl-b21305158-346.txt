B24 along tlie course of which, the} pass, in three or lour branches, towards the wrist. The connection of the brandies of both these nerves witli the veins at the bend of the arm, will be fully described in tba Surgical Dissec- tion of that part. The three great nerves,—the radial, or median, the ulnar, and the muscular spiral, may easily be traced at the same time with the branches of the arteries. The median, or radial, will be found to rise from that di- vision of the plexus which surrounds the artery, and to be often connected with theperforans Casserii.—It maybe traced along the inside of the artery, and closely con- nected with it. When at the bend of the arm, it gives off three branches, which supply the muscles of the fore arm. But the principal nerve does not now run in the course of either of the great arteries, but will be found to pass in the middle of the fore arm, between the flexor subli- mis and flexor profundus; whence it is more properly called Median, than Radial. It then passes under the an- nular ligament; but previous to this, it generally gives off some small branches to the integuments upon the inside of the thumb. In the palm of the hand, it will generally be found to divide into [five branches,—one of which, may be traced to the abductor and flexor pollicis brevis; another, to the adductor and side of the thumb ; a third, to the fore-finger; the fourth passes to one side of the fore and middle fingers; and the fifth, to the other side of the middle, and to one side of the ring finger:—be- sides these branches, lesser ones will be fouud passing into the small muscles in the palm of the hand. The ulnar rises from the lower and inner part of the plexus.—The Internal cutaneous will often be found to be the first branch which it gives off'. It may then be traced down behind the inner condyle of the humerus; but before it reaches this point, some branches will be seen going from it, to the skin and triceps muscle. Immediately after passing the condyle, it gives a branch to the flexor muscles;—it then passes betwten the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum sublimis: here it will be found to join the ulnar artery, along which, it may be traced to the wrist. In this course, it gives off a few muscular branches ; but when near the wrist, a branch will be found, which passes under the flexor carpi ulna- ris, and over the lower end of the ulna, to be distributed on the back of the hand, and on the little and ring fingers : this is the Ramus Posticus. The trunk of the nerve passes under the annular liga-

224 which cross from the cartilage of the one side to that of the other, are called eigamenta transversalia. Between the first rib and the sternum, the union by cartilage is very complete. The cartilages of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, are connected by loose capsular liga- ments, and by ligamentous slips, which are extended between them, to keep them in their proper position. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE CLAVICLES, STER- NUM, AND THE FIRST RIB OF EACH SIDE. The sternum should be cut through the middle; the clavicles and first ribs should also be cut, about the middle- The first ligament we perceive, is that running between the heads of the two clavicles, across the sternum; it is called EIGAMENTUM INTERCEAVICULARE. There may then be observed, slips of ligament running from the heads of the clavicle, upon the sternum; those on the external part, form the eigamenta anteria; and on the internal part, the eigamenta postica. Under these slips, there is a capsular ligament; but before examining this particularly, we should attend to the con- nection which there is between the clavicle and the first rib.—Between the upper part of the rib, and the tubercle on the lower part of the clavicle, close to its connection with the sternum, a strong ligament will be seen, which, from its shape, is called ligamentum rhomboides. The capsular ligament between the clavicle and sternum, may now be opened; and then there will be seen, an interarlicular cartilage, which is connected to the sternum and clavicle, by portions of the capsular ligament,—so that the capsular ligament may be described here, as in the jaw, as composed of two parts.

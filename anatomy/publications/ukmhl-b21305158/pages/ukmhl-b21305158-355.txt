333 the course of two hours, sent from shop to shop,—until at last, after having lost about two pints of blood, she found one druggist bolder than the others; who, .however, to stop the hemorrhage, resorted to such means as injured the arm so much, that 1 found great difficulty in saving To impress upon the student the importance of the study of the surgical anatomy of the fore arm, I shall here introduce what Mr. Charles Bell has said, in his System of Dissections:— “ Of the tjlnar and radial arteries at the wrist— There is no part of the body, in which it is more necessary to connect the anatomy with the accidents, than here at the wrist; for, from apparently slight accidental wounds of these arteries, there come great pain, inflammation, deep driving of the blood, unskilful operations, and bad surgery, and danger of losing the arm, and even the life of the patient. The danger is from these vessels,—the ulnar artery, as it turns over the wrist, and the radial, as it turns over the root of the thumb, or the palmar arch in the hand, not being neatly tied at first. The con- sideration of this dcpaitment of surgery would lead us too far; I only say, look to it now, when the parts are before you. 1 would beg you also, to look to the peculiar appearance of the fat, and the aponeurosis on the palm. “ In a wound of the artery in the palm, we put in a large pad, or compress, and close the band, and bind it firmly; but if the arch of the palm be cut, this does not com< pletely stem the blood,—or the pain and inflammation are such, as will not allow the bandage to be drawn suffi^- ciently tight; we must then undo the bandage, and en- deavour to find the artery; but the appearance of the wound is changed; it is tumid, and the cellular membrane * A surgeon in the country will find, that an arm, which has been only partially dissected, if preserved in spirits, (and so, that it may be taken out of the jar for examination,) will be much more useful to him, than the finest display of the minute branches of the arteries. Such a preparation will not be very expensive, nor will it be difficult to preserve. After the blood has been pushed out of the vessels, a mixture of proof spirit, saturated with alum, should be injected into them. A liquid, composed of two-thirds of proof spirit to one of distilled water, saturated with alum, will then be sufficiently strong to preserve the arm ;—it may be cut through at the middle of the biceps, and at the middle of the fore arm.

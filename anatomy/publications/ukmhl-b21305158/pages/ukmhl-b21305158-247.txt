225 DISSECTION or THE ARTERIES AND VEINS OF THE CHEST, NECK, AND HEAD. —— There is no part more important to the student, than the surgical anatomy of these vessels ; hut he must restrain hit impatience, and be content, in the first dissection, to learn their branches only. The injection of the vessels of the upper part of an adult, or old body, is generally made in the following manner:— An incision is to be carried, through the skin, in the length of the sternum; the bone is then to be cut through, in the same line; and the chest is to be forcibly opened, by pulling on the two portions of the flternum. A piece of wood, about four or five inches long, is then to be placed between them. The pericardium is to be opened ; and a large pipe (around which a little cloth must he wrapped) is to be put into the aorta, just at its origin from the ventricle. The descending aorta must be tied, about opposite to the fifth dorsal vertebra.—It will easily be found, by tearing up the adhesions of the left lung. When an injection is made, with the arteries prepared in this manner, only the vessels of the head and arms will be filled. Though this is not so good a method as the following, to enable us to show the origins of the vessels from the aorta ; still we are generally obliged to do it, if the body is old, or if the aorta is very much dilated. But when the subject is young, and when we are not anxious to preserve the muscles on the side of the chest, the thorax may be so opened, that a pipe may be put into the aorta, opposite to the sixth dorsal vertebra. The in- jection must, in this case, be prevented from distending the ventricle, by an assistant holding the root of the aorta; for the valves will very seldom prevent the wax. from passing into the ventricle. If the injection be al-

221 front and sides of the process, and proceed upwards, di- verging a little, to be attached to the edge of the foramen magnum; these are generally called ligamenta late- rally, or moderatoria : for that which has been de- scribed as a Perpendicular Ligament, is nothing more than a few slips of membrane which may be found between these two lateral ligaments. But the principal ligament here, is that which runs across between the two tubercles on the inside of the atlas; it is called ligamentum transversale, and locks in the processus dentatus. The Appendices of this ligament are merely its edges, extend- ing upwards and downwards. The corresponding surfaces of the processus dentatus, and of the atlas, are connected together by a very fine capsular ligament. There is some difficulty in showing these ligaments distinctly. The dissection will be facilitated by twist- ing the vertebrae round;—for then the ligaments will be easily distinguished from the cellular membrane which covers them, by the resistance which they offer.

When the muscles are dissected away from below the jaw, the fascia which connects the styloid process to the jaw, being necessarily cut through, the joint will be much weakened. To understand the structure of this joint, we should compare it with those of the carnivorous and graminivo- rous animals.——In the carnivorous animal, as. for ex— U3

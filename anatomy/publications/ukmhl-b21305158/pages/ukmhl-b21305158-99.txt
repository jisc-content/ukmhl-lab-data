77 H 3 Warner’s Treatise on the Testicle, that the “ tunica albu- ginea, so named from its complexion, is a compact, firm, white, strong, and smoothly polished membrane, having a tendinous appearance” ; and Pott, in speaking of hydro- cele, says, “ this fluid, in a natural and small quantity, serves to keep the tunica albuginea moist, and to prevent a cohesion between it and the tunica vaginalis”. The term “ tunica vagiualis reflexa” is very objection- able,—because, as it is not used by any surgical writers in the description of hydrocele, or of congenital hernia, it is very liable to lead a student into great difficulties ; and, moreover, it is given to a part which covered the testicle, while it was yet within the abdomen, and, consequently, before that which is called “ tunica vagiualis ” was formed. If we wish to distinguish the two portions of the perito- neum which are within the scrotum, we may call that one in contact with the body of the testicle, the Peritoneal Covering, and the other, the Reflected Peritoneal Coat of the testicle,—as we distinguish the part of the peritoneum which covers the intestines, from that which lines the ab- dominal muscles. By maceration, we may show the fibrous texture which is under the peritoneal covering; but by this process of dissection, we shall destroy all resemblance to a coat which we would call “ albuginea.” Before dissecting farther, we should consider the sur- gical anatomy of these coats. We can now understand how, in a common hydrocele of the adult, the body of the testicle will be on the back part, and the water which is confined between the tunica vaginalis and albuginea, will form the anterior part of the tumour. We can also com- prehend how, in a child, where the connection with the ab- domen is not closed, that there may be a hydrocele which may be emptied by pressure and change of position, but which will again return when the child is put on its legs®- It is also evident, that as long as this communication re- mains open, that a portion of the intestine may come down into the space between the tunica vaginalis and albu- ginea, so as to form the species of inguinal hernia which is called congenital. In dissecting the cord, we shall sometimes discover, that part of the peritoneal surface has not united firmly, but that a species of encysted hydrocele has taken place in it. We should now proceed to examine the structure of the testicle, as a gland. The cord is composed of arteries, veins, absorbents, and the excretory duct of the testicle,—

75 H 2 DISSECTION OF THE TESTICLE. It is more important to have an accurate idea of the i formation of the coats of the testicle, than of the struc- ture of the gland; because, without this, we cannot form a correct opinion upon the varieties of hydrocele and hernia. But as we cannot attain it, without examining the testicle in its descent in the foetus, I shall, before describing its structure in the adult, point out some of the changes which take place in its coverings, during the existence of t the foetus. ✓ If we examine a foetus of six months old, we shall dis- cover the testicle lying under the kidney, on the fore part of the psoae muscles, and covered by the peritoneum, which adheres to it, in the same manner as to the viscera of the abdomen: we may also observe a ligamentous, or cellular cord, which stretches up from the inside of the abdominal ring to the body of the testicle,—this is the GCBERNACULUM TESTIS. In a foetus at the eighth month, we shall probably find the testicle lying in the inguinal canal, and a small portion of peritoneum projecting before it, towards the scrotum. But if we examine a child at the period of birth, or a short time after it, the testicle will be found in the scro- tum, and covered by two portions of peritoneum; the most superficial, is the same as that which, in the foetus of eight months, projected into the inguinal canal,—the other, which adheres to the body of the gland, is the same which covered the testicle while it lay in the loin. If, at this period, a probe be pushed upwards between the two portions of the peritoneum, it will pass into the abdomen: but in the adult, though the two portions of the perito- neum are still distinct from each other, we shall not be able to pass a probe farther than the upper part of the scrotum; because the communication with the abdomen is now closed by the adhesion of the peritoneal surfaces. I shall now suppose that we are to make a dissection ot

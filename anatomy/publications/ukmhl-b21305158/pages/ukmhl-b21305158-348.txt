326 SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE ARM. The most important part of this dissection, is, that of the vessels about the elbow and wrist; for they are liable to be opened by accidents, which may appear trifling, but, if neglected, or if treated by a surgeon who is not fully master of the anatomy, may be followed by the most serious consequences ;—sometimes by the loss of the limb, or even by death. .The dissection of the subclavian artery, above the cla- vicle, should also be most carefully made; for though it is very improbable that an operation on the artery itself, will be followed by success, still we ought to know accu- rately the connections which it has with the parts in its vicinity,—that we may be enabled to avoid it, in extir- pating tumours, or even to take it up for a case of aneu- rism. The question of the rule of practice, in aneurism of the subclavian, is very difficult to determine. We shall find, by the history of the cases of aneurism of this ar- tery, that the relative position of the parts connected with it, are so changed by the aueurisraal tumour, that even though we may have a very accurate knowledge of them in their natural state, still we may be foiled in the attempt to take up the artery when an aneurism has formed.—When it is known, that even Sir Astley Cooper has been obliged to stop in the middle of such an opera- tion, we may be satisfied that it is not a very practicable one : his words are,—“ The clavicle was thrust upwards by the tumour, so as to make it impossible to pass a liga- ture under the artery, without incurring a risk of includ- ing some of the nerves of the axillary plexus : the attempt was therefore abandoned.” The same histories will also lead us to doubt the pro-

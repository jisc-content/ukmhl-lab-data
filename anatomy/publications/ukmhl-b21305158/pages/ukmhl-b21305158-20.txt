xiv INTRODUCTION. \vhich he necessarily forms, from the exhibition of the parts, as prepared for demonstration on the lecturer's* table; for he will discover how much must neces- sarily be taken away, to make the muscles, ar- teries, or nerves sufficiently distinct for public de- monstration. But the more serious objection is,— that a student who delays commencing dissection until he has attended several courses of lectures on anatomy, never makes much proficiency in it, nor ever goes con amove to his task ; perhaps there may be a moral cause for this. The student finds, that those who commenced the study of anatomy, at the same time with himself, and who have been, from the first, attending the operations in the dissecting- room, are much farther advanced in the actual knowledge of the parts ; he is ashamed to begin, knowing that his old companions are already adroit,, and conscious that he must make an awkward ex- hibition ;—indeed, I have frequently found that stu- dents so situated, have, in the course of an hour, (to show some dexterity), finished the dissection of a limb; but, of course, in a very imperfect manner. It is surely needless to impress upon the student, that though he may be able to point out any part of the body which is exposed, he can never be a dex- terous, nor even a safe operator, unless he practises dissection; indeed, the question of the propriety of a man attempting to operate, who has never dis- sected, resolves itself simply into this;—as an ope- ration is only a nice and difficult dissection,—is the first essay to be made on the living body ? I would recommend the student not only to dissect the important vessels, See. with unwearied diligence; but also to practise himself in removing the cellular membrane from the larger muscles,* as it is the most * More use should be made of the bodies of animals than is gene- rally done. In a surgical view, the dissection of them can only he of use in giving a degree of familiarity in the management of the knife : hilt they are of great service in every question regarding the minute structure of a part, or of its fuuction,—and particularly in the investigation of the nervous system, or of the structure of the organs of sense, or of the viscera.

Interossei Pedis Externi Bicipites. There are four of these muscles, each of which arises, by two origins, from the metatarsal bones, between which they lie. The following names have been given to them :—Abductor Indicis Pedis,—Adductor Indicis Pedis;—- Abductor Medii Digiti Pedis;—Abductor Tertii Digiti Pedis. DISSECTION OF THI LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS, AND OF THE JOINTS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. The dissection of the ligaments of the upper part of the pelvis is generally a very unpleasant task for the young student, because it is seldom made until the parts are almost putrid. If the muscles are much decayed, they should be re- moved, and the pelvis put into water for a day or two. But the best method of proceeding is, either to remove the muscles while they are fresh, and to dissect the liga- ments of the pelvis before the muscles below the knee are examined, or to allow the parts to lie in water until the muscles become so soft that they can be easily separated from the ligaments. The ligaments of the pelvis may be divided into several distinct sets:—1st. those which unite the vertebras and the sacrum; 2d. the ligaments which run from the ilium to the vertebrae ; 3d. those which are between the ilium and the sacrum ; but all these are of very trifling importance, compared to those which are between the bones at the outlet of the pelvis.

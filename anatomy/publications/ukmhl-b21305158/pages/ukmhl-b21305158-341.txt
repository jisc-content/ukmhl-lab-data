310 DISSECTION O F THE VEINS OF THE ARM. It is almost needless to inject the veins of the arm, un- less it be for the purpose of making a preparation ; for a much better knowledge is gained of the course of the superficial veins, by putting a ligature round the arm of a thin muscular man, than is ever,done by injecting, or dis- secting them. As the deep veins all accompany the ar- teries, their course may also be easily understood ; but in making the surgical dissection at the bend of the arm, it will be useful to have some of the veins filled. Though I do not think it necessary for the dissection, I shall here describe the manner of injecting the veins, that they, may be preserved: — In consequence of the numerous valves which are in the veins, it will be impossible to inject them from the subclavian: — the injection must be thrown in, from one of the vessels on the hand. Those on the palm are so small, that it will be needless to try to introduce a pipe into them.—We must look for a vein on the back of the hand. That vein which runs up from the fore finger, or the one between the little and ring finger, will generally be found to be the best. After we have introduced the pipe, a piece of the skin over the vein, should be included in the ligature; or we shall be in danger of tearing the coats of the vein, while we are injecting it. The blood is to be first thoroughly pushed out of the veins, by injecting warm water into them, and allowing it to escape by the subclavian. This injection of warm water, should be repeated several times; and previous to

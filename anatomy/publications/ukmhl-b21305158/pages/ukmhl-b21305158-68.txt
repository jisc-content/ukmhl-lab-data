46 tines; for we have not only the great omentum attached to it, but also little projections of peritoneum, called ap- pendices epiploicae, or omentula ; hut the longitudinal and circular hands of muscular fibres, are the most distin- guishing marks. The circular hands are very numerous, but there are only three longitudinal ones. On examin- ing tiie gut more minutely, we shall find that Lhere are very few lacteals upon it, hut plenty of absorbents; and on the inner surface, that there are few valvular conni- ventcs. The parts at the union between the ileon and colon are complicated ; when the gut is distended we see them more distinctly; the whole is called caput coll, upon which we particularize,—the crecum,which is the name given to that gut which, in horses, is nearly a yard long, but in the hu- man body, it is only about two inches in length, and is not observable except when distended with air; the processus vermiformis will be easily discovered, from its resemblance to an earth worm. The valve between the colon and ileon cannot be well understood except when the gut is dried ; but even in the fresh state, on opening the cascuin in water, the valve may be seen to be formed by the pro- jection of part of the muscular and internal coat of the ileon into the colon, so as to present an appearance like the flood-gates of a canal. The peculiarities of the rectum will be observed in the dissection of the parts contained within the pelvis ; at present, I shall only remark, that there are in the colon, and particularly in the rectnm, mucous folicles, which have been called glandulas solitaria2, to distinguish them from folicles which are found in sets in the small intestines, which have been there called glandulre aggregate:— these openings are more distinctly seen in the reclum of the horse or ass, than in the human body. The most important parts of the liver have already been seeu ; but when it is completely separated from the other viscera, some points may be more easily understood. If the liver has been taken from a young body, then the substance of the round ligament will not be firm, nor completely closed in the centre, but so open, that a probe may be pushed into it; this is in consequence of the um- bilical vein, which degenerates into the round ligament, not having yet become so firm as it is found in the adult. If we trace the round or umbilical ligament, we shall find it become connected with the vena portie, and then pass to the upper and back part of the liver; but it does not retain the same name through its whole course; for as,

275 he deduces from the examination of the foetal eye, for in it, may be proved, that the vessels of the tunica vasculosa retinas, are continued on the back part of the capsule of the lens. But as all these membranes are exceedingly delicate and transparent, in the adult,—the manner in which they are connected together, will always continue to be a matter of dispute. If an eye be now so cut, as to allow the lens and vitreous humour to fall out, in connection with each other, we may again have a good opportunity of showing the Petitian canal j for if we make a puncture in the angle between the two humours, we may distend the canal with any coloured fluid, as red ink: if it be done with size and vermilion, it may be kept as a preparation. The easiest way of doing this, is to suck up a little of the fluid with a glass tube which has been drawn to a point sufficiently line to enter the puncture,—by blowing a very little, the injection will fill the canal. This part may also be easily demonstrated when the eye is slightly putrid, by cutting off the cornea, and about a line of the sclerotic;—we should then tear up the iris, which will separate easily from the ciliary processes ; by then pushing the processes back with the probe, we shall be enabled to make a puncture by the side of the lens, into which the blow-pipe is to be introduced ;—but if we have not made the puncture in the right place, the capsule of the lens, or the capsule of the vitreous humour, will be distended. There is-still another transparent membrane, viz. that of the aqueous humour : in some animals, as in the hare, and rabbit, it is very easy to demonstrate it; but the human eye, and that of the sheep, must be macerated, almost to putrefaction, before this delicate membrane will separate from the inside of the cornea. We have now to examine the humours. The aqueous humour is seen, on puncturing the cornea: it is described as having two chambers; one, anterior to the irisy-rthe other, posterior to it; but when we cut off the cornea, we shall see that the lens lies almost close upon the iris,—so that the space behind the iris, (the Posterior Chamber,) is almost ideal.* * The size of the two chambers may be shown, by freezing the eye,—a thin pellicle only, of ice, will be found between the lens and the iris.

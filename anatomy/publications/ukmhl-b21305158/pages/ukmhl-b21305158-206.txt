184 Triangularis Sterni. Or. From the posterior surface, ai:d lateral edges of the sternum, and from the ensiform cartilage. In. Into the posterior surfaces of the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. DISSECTION OF TUI PARTS WITHIN THE THORAX. —«=oeet©»®e=— When the muscles are removed from the fore part, the chest will appear of a conical shape, for each rib in suc- cession from the first, forms the segment of a larger circle. We shall now see that it is the projection of the bones and muscles of the shoulder, which gives the ap- pearance of breadth to the upper part of the thorax ; and this view will also explain, how it may be supposed that a wound has penetrated the chest, when it has only passed under the shoulder. There are several modes of opening the thorax.—The following method will be found useful, when we wish to acquire a general idea of its contents, and are not anxious to preserve the bones or the small arteries. The middle of the cartilages of all the seven superior ribs, except the first, are to be cut through with the knife;* the bony parts of the same ribs are then to be sawed through at a point near to their angles, taking care not to encroach upon any of the muscles of the back, ex- cept the latissimus dorsi. The intermediate portions of the ribs may then be re- moved ;—the sternum will remain supported in its natural position, by its union to the first rib and clavicle above, and to the remaining ribs below. We shall uow see, that the cavity of the thorax is di- * We shall be generally obliged to use a saw, to cut through the cartilages of a person abo’. e the age of forty.

240 The veins from the thyroid, correspond very much will* n the course of the arteries; the superior ones passing into , the jugular, and the inferior into the subclavian, or thd ; transverse vein, which passes across the great arteries. The internal JUGULAR vein is principally formed bill the sinuses of the dura mater, which have already beritU described at p. 156; but in its passage down tbe neck, i> generally receives branches corresponding to the deep ar teries. It will be difficult to trace tbe branches of the vf.rti j oral veins. The basilar sinus generally passes into them they receive, also, the branches from the upper part oil the spinal marrow : but they are principally formed by : net-work of veins, which surround the processes of th«j i spine, and come from the deep arteries which supply lh«*i small muscles of the back. The trunk of the vein passe ■, in the same canal with the artery, viz. in the transverswg processes, and terminates in the subclavian veiu. DIS SECTI ON OF THE NERVES OF THE NECK AND HEAD. We may begin either with the dissection of the nervej * of the face, which arc from the V‘*> and the VIIth, or wit ” the plexus, which is formed immediately under the skis I of the neck, by the superficial branches of the cervicn nerves and spinal accessory.* * In tbe following description of the manner of dissecting tht i nerves, I shall introduce, in the form of notes, some of those obsev vations which Mr. Bell has been for many years in the habit of mall I ing while delivering his lectures on the nerves;—several of thestf w

51 there may be cases of true tympanitis, still the most proba- bie cause of the formation of this air, is the change pro- duced after death by putrefaction. In some cases of gan- grene of the intestines, air may have escaped into the gene- ral cavity immediately before death- The great distention of the stomach and intestines, is also commonly produced by the change which takes place in their contents after death ; though there is always more or less air within the intestines during life. From the variety of appearances of inflammation,—from the black spots,—and from the ulceration and corrosion, which, in the course of my dissections, I have seen in the stomachs of those who have died without any marked symptoms of affection of that viscus,—and from the close resemblance which many of these have had to the stomachs of those persons who have swallowed poison,—and from the similarity of the appearances produced by gastritis, and ether diseases, to those caused by poison,—1 have come to the conviction, that the appearance of the stomach or in- testines alone, in a question of poison, is not to be depended on. In the last book which has been written on poisons, (that of Orfila,) the list of appearances which is given, as to be expected, where poison has been taken, corresponds ex- actly with those which I have found in stomachs where I was certain no deleterious matter had been taken. I am happy to think, that this degree of uncertainty will prevent the anatomist from being called on to decide a question which may involve the life of a fellow creature. In examining the abdomen of children who have died in consequence of irritation in the bowels, we shall fre- quently And one portion of the gut invaginated in the other. This is introsusceptio ; but in the child it is seldom the cause of death, while in the adult it is generally at- tended with such inflammation as to produce strangulation and death. If a patient has died with symptoms of hernia, and no external tumour be discovered, we may expect to find an introsusceptio, or a portion of the intestine stran- gulated, by a noose formed of condensed omentum, or mesentery ; in these cases, the portion of gut above the point of strangulation will be red, thickened, and distend- ed, while the portion below will be pale and empty. If a patient has long suffered from chronic inflammation of the abdomen, we may expect to find the intestines com- pletely glued together: this is a common appearance in the abdomen of those who have been repeatedly tapped. In the scrophulous child we shall probably find the me- F2

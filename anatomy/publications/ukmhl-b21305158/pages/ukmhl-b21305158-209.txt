187 To see the anterior cavity, we must cut through the lower end of the sternum, and carry it towards I he neck ; in doing this, the pleura of each side must necessarily be separated from each other, so (hat the anterior cavity will appear larger than it naturally is. The parts within this cavity, or, in other words, between the two pleura;, are the remains of the tiiymus gland, and some small vessels, particularly a lymphatic trunk, which, how- ever, is not visible unless it be injected. When the chest is cut perpendicularly through, or when the diaphragm is dissected away, we shall see the posterior cavity,—which is formed by the pleura; se- parating from each other, and passing to the sides of the spine, so as to leave a triangular space,—through which the oesophagus, vena azygos, the thoracic duct, par vagum, and some branches of the sympathetic, will afterwards be found to pass. When the upper part of the space is examined, a small portion of the bronchii, and some lym- phatic glands will be found ;—in the lower part of the cavity, we may perhaps include a portion of the vena cava ascendens ; though both this, and the cava descen- dens, are more properly in the middle space.* If we now examine the external surface of the pericar- dium, we shall find that a considerable part of it is covered by the pleura;—but as the lower part of the pericardium always adheres strongly to the tendinous part of the dia- phragm, neither this portion of it, nor of the diaphragm, can be lined by the pleura. When we open the pericardium, we shall find that its internal surface is exactly similar to that of the pleura,— indeed this membrane may he taken as an example of the great serous membranes; for its connections with the heart, are the same as those of the peritoneum with the viscera of the abdomen, or of the pleura with the lungs. There has been a homely simile often given as explana- tory of the connection between the pericardium and heart, viz. the double night-cap on the head; but there is no necessity for such an analogy; for, by holding the bag of the pericardium open, we may trace the loose portion down towards the base of the heart, where the great vessels arise ; from this, it is reflected upon the ante- rior surface of the heart, to which it adheres very close- ly ;—if we trace it to the opposite side, we shall find it again reflected from the base, to form the bag. •Though these parts have been now described, it will be incouve Bient to follow them in the first dissection.

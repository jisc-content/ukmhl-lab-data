210 the section of a large healthy breast is put into spirits, and compared with a preparation of a section of a scir- rhous breast, that has not run into ulceration,â€”I belie\e that even good judges of preparations, may be led to be- lieve, that both specimens are examples of the same dis- ease. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. I shall now suppose, that the student who is making the first dissection of the upper part of the body, has examin- ed the general anatomy of the viscera of the thorax, and that he is prepared to turn the body, to expose the muscles of the back. The first muscles which are to be dissected, are those which are connected with the arms. The body must be put into such a position, that the fibres of those muscles may be made tense: this may be done by putting blocks of wood under the chest, so as to elevate it; and then to let the head and arms hang down. To expose the first layer of muscles which is formed by the uatissimus dorsi and trapezius, we should make an incision along the whole length of the spine, and ano- ther from the last dorsal vertebra, in an oblique direction, to the spine of the scapula, along which, it is to be con- tinued to the acromion. Another cut is then to be made from the acromion to the tubercle of the occipital bone. These three incisions will nearly mark the boundaries of the trapezius ; but, as the middle fibres of this muscle pass directly across from the spine to the scapula, the dissection will be much facilitated, if an incision be made through the skin, from the first dorsal vertebra, to the middle of the spine of the scapula. The dissection is to be commenced at this cut, and is to be continued, first, towards the lower oblique incision, and then towards the upper, fol lowiDg the course of the fibres.

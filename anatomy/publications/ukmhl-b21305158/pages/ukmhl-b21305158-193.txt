DISSECTION OK THE MUSCLES OF TIIE FACE. —e®»®|©l®®S ca- lf the scull be still entire, an incision should be made, through the skin, from the middle of the parietal bone to i the external part of the eye-brow,—and another, from the I crown to the tip of the nose. The object of the first in- cision, is, to expose the muscular fibres of the occitito frontalis; and that of the second, to show those fibres which pass down on the nose. The next incision is to be made in a semicircular direction over the eye-brow, so as to meet the two first incisions, Another may then be made under the eye-brow, and be continued round the orbit, so that the eye-brow will be left, and the fibres of the orbicularis oculi be exposed. After completing the dissection of the occipito fron- talis and the orbicularis oculi, with the corrugatoh. su- fercilii, which will be exposed by cutting through the nasal fibres of the occipito frontalis, we should pass to the dissection of the muscles of the mouth. An incision is to be made round the mouth, leaving a small part of the lip : this will expose the orbicularis oris, into which the other muscles are inserted. By then carrying an incision from the zygomatic process to this circular cut, the zygomatic muscles will be exposed ; and if another is continued down to the angle of the jaw, from the same point, the fibres of the masseter will be seen;— but in doing this, we must take care that we do not wound the parotid, duct, which crosses the face, nearly in a line drawn from the upper part of the lobe of the ear, to the ala of the nose. By dissecting down the flap of skin between the two last cuts, the buccinator will be exposed. A large por- tion of fat will be generally found running between this muscle and the edge of the masseter, but it is so loosely attached, that it may be pulled away with the fingers. - As, in this dissection, we do not value the skin, we should Q2

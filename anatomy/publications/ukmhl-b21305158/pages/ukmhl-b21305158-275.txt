253 make this, which has hitherto been considered a fagging task,—a pleasing and interesting subject of inquiry. same effects are produced, as when a portion of it is cut out. In proof of this, I offer the experiment of dividing the portio dura, in the horse or ass. The zig-zag structure of the nerve, appears to me to render it almost impossible, when it is cut, that its ends shall re- main in contact; at all events, the degree of retraction, that we always see in the portions of a divided nerve, entitles us to call upon the supporters of this new doctrine, to prove, that the ends of the nerves continued in contact in those rabbits in which the nerves were cut, and the digestion went on. It may also be required of the experimenters, to show, that the functions of the stomach will be restored by bringing the ends of a nerve again into contact, from which a portion has been removed. If the idea be correct, that there is a great and immediate difference between the consequences of simply dividing a nerve, and the remov- ing a portion of it,—will it not follow, that little or no effect would be produced by the application of a ligature on the par vagum, since, by this, the chain of connection will not be broken ? DISSECTION OF THE DEEP NERVES OF THE HEAD. *'* *l* #‘'' f * * * - » Before the student commences this dissection, he should furnish himself with a mallet and chisels, small saws, pin* cers, delicate hooks, and a magnifying glass. He should also have the base of a scull always lying before him. The manner in which the nerves arise from the brain, has been pointed out at page 144. The Ist, or olfactory, passes into the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone,—but its structure is generally sp soft, that we cannot trace its filaments. The IId, or optic, we see entering into the foramen opti- cuni. We shall afterwards, in the dissection of the eye, find Z

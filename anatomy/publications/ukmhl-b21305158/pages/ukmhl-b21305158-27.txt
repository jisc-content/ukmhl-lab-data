5 B 3 inferior). The fibres which rise from the posterior part of the spine of the ilium run obliquely upwards, to be inserted by fleshy fibres into the three lowest ribs, and by a thin tendinous membrane to the four next ribs. The fibres which arise from the middle of the spine run towards the linea alba; but at the linea semilunaris the tendon splits, and one portion having united to the tendon of the external oblique, runs anterior to the rectus, and is inserted to the whole extent of the linea alba—while the other portion of the tendon, which passes behind the rectus, is not attached to the whole of the linea alha, but is gradually lost about half way between the umbilicus and os pubis ; so that the whole of the rectus is not contained in a sheath. That portion of the internal oblique which arises from Poupart’s ligament is inserted into the tuberous angle of the os pubis: but here there is a set of fibres which sometimes confuse the dissector; they are seen dis- tinctly in the male only, for they form the cremaster mus- cle; they arise generally from the internal oblique, but sometimes from the ligament; they cover the spermatic cord, pass with it through the ring, and are lost upon the upper part of the tunica vaginalis testis. Unless we are at liberty to put the body into whatever position we please, it will be very difficult to dissect the next muscle ; and it will be almost impossible to show all its origins before the muscles of the back are dissected ; for its fibres rise from the edges of the eleventh and twelfth ribs, and from the transverse processes of the last dorsal and the four superior lumbar vertebra ; so that, coming from this deep source, they must pass between the quadratus lum- borura and sacro lumbalis. Therefore, at present, we can show only the connections which the trausversalis has with the muscles on the anterior part of the abdomen. We may commence by raising the attachments of the internal oblique from the cartilages of the ribs, from the fascia lumborum, and from the spine of the ilium ; but it is very difficult to separate the lower edges of the two muscles from each other, for they lie so close together, that, in raising the attachments of the oblique, we are apt to lift the transver- sals also. The separation is most easily begun at the spine of the ilium, for there is a small artery here, which marks the line of division between the muscles. In this dissection we must not expect to make the transversalis appear very clean ; for we must carry the knife across the tine of the fibres. It will be difficult to carry the obliquus farther than the linea semilunaris, for there, the tendons of the two muscles

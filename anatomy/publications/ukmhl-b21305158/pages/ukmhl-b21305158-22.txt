XVI INTRODUCTION* dead, will also.-be, found very convenient. * For the more minute dissections, he will require two,small hooks, and a sharp steel point;—the etching tools which are used by engravers, are very useful; particu- larly if the points are bent a little, as we can then easily tear away the cellular membrane from the •mall nerves. + It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say, that the student should endeavour to prevent the bad effects of. sitting •several hours in a cold dissecting-room: the most effectual way, is, to put on an additional flannel jacket, and carpet shoes over his hoots. I, would moreover advise him, for the comfort of himself and his friends, to make a distinct rule, never to .sit in the dissecting-room, with the coat which he wears through the day ; but to keep oue for the pur- pose of using while he is there. A* cap should be worn, in preference to a hat, which is not only.incon- venient, but also very quickly acquires a bad smell. I think I have observed, that it: is. necessary for students from the country, to live a little fuller, while attending the dissecting-room, than they have been accustomed to do while-in the country. If they do 'this, and, at the same time, take regular exercise, and attend to the state of their bowels, they will ge- nerally escape the bad consequences which occasion- ally occur from a cut on the finger. The best treatment for the inflamed lymphatics, and the swollen arm, is to apply lint* soaked in the sugar of lead lotion, and tincture of opium, to the arm; and to take calomel purges, and large doses of opium, with plenty of wine and. porter. * All these things may be got at a carpenter’s tool shop ;->-the ehisela, which are used for cutting iron, are tbe best. t It is necessary to -hare one or two ooarse cloths, to cover tbe parts which have been dissected; to they very quickly spoil, when left exposed to the air.

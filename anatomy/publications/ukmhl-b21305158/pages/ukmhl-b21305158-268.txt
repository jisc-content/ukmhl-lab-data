24 G will be seen to arise from several of the cervical nerves * By then dissecting on the lower edge of the scalenus, and by throwing out the arai, we shall see a certain number of these cervical nerves, passing to form the axillary plexus, viz. the four inferior cervical, and the first dorsal. But before we trace these nerves back towards the spinal mar- row, we should cut to the depth of a quarter of an inch through the fibres of the scalenus anticus; and then, about opposite to where the phrenic lies, we shall see a nerve, which rises from nearly the same roots as the phrenic, and which runs under the axillary plexus, as a distinct nerve, to the external muscles of respiration : this branch, Mr. Bell has called the External JVerve of the muscles of Respiration. As we shall now have exhibited all the principal branches of the neck, we may, after making them more distinct, pass either to the dissection of the deep nerves of the scull, or to those of the thorax and abdomen. If the body is not very fresh, we should first dissect those of the thorax The deep [nerves of the scull will be more distinctly seen, if the pfirls have been previously soaked in water. i A 4 ■.a M * • This nerve is generally described as rising from the third and fourth cervical; but by dissecting it carefully, we shall find that it l»as origins from the portio dura, and from the ninth, and also the spinal accessory. It is a curious fact, that this is the only nerve which was, previous to the discoveries of Mr. Bell, considered as a respiratory nerve to 1 the muscles. He has called it the Internal Respiratory Nerve.

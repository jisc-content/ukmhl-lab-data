2G2 There will also be branches seen passing along the Vidian nerve, towards the ganglion of Meckel. larger animals, that it is quite an error to suppose, that the principal connection between the sympathetic and the nerves of the head, is through the VIll‘ pair. By an attentive examination, it will be found, that the branches of the sympathetic, which appear to unite with the VIth, pass along it, and unite with the ganglionic portion of the Vth. The branches of the sympathetic, which actually unite with the VI11', are very small. DISSECTION OF THE PARTS OF THE NOSE AND OF THE EAR. After having finished the dissection of the nerves, the scull should be divided, so that we may have an opportu- nity of examining the nose, and some parts of the ear. The section of the scull may be made by carrying the saw through the remaining part of the bones of the head and face, in a perpendicular line,—but a little to one side of the septum narium.—The soft palate, &c. is to be cut in the same direction. Each of the sections will afford us some very useful views,—particularly if the pharynx and larynx be left attached to one of them. Indeed the ana- tomy of the posterior nares, &c. is so important, that the student should always examine it, even though he should destroy many of the small muscles. The cavities of the nose will be made more distinct, by cutting (in one of the sections) through the superior maxillary bone, immediately below the orbital plate, and

271 found running between the sclerotic and choroid, which ought to be cut,—not torn. The choroid will now appear to be of a jet black colour, which is owing to a black se- cretion ; yet if we scrape the membrane with the finger, very little colouring matter will come off. But although this secretion is on its inner surface, still a little exudes through the coat; for even in a very fresh eye, the surface of the sclerotic, in contact with the choroid, will be slightly discoloured. The iris willuow be more distinctly seen, and, between it and the choroid, the white ring, which has received many names, viz. ligamentum ciliare; corpus ciliarc; annulus ligamentosus; annulus gangliformis tunicce clioroidece: but the name most commonly given to it, is ligamentum CILIA RE* The choroid consists of two lamina?:—by cutting very carefully, with a small scalpel, through one half of the membrane about the middle of the eye, and by pulling upon the divided portion with the forceps, we may show both of the lamina?; but it is difficult to do this nicely : however, we shall at once be able to understand the dif- ference between the two laminae, when the choroid is se- parated from the retina; for then, the internal surface will appear of a bright colour, and villous,—while the external, will be dull, and cellular. The external part is called the true choroid, from its re- semblance to the chorion of the foetus,—the inner part has, in honour of the discoverer, been called Tunica Ruyschiana. The variegated colour of the internal surface, in some ani- mals, having some resemblance to the colour of fine ta- pestry, has induced the Parisian dissectors to give it the name of tapetum.* Though we cannot make the following dissection on the same eye on which the internal part of the choroid has been examined, yet the description may now be given. The cornea, and half an inch of the anterior part of the sclerotic, is to be carefully removed from the choroid :— * The pigment, upon the surface of the tapetum, is generally black in men, but the secretion is of various colours, in different animals ; sometimes it is deficient, and this gives the appearance of the red eye, as in the white rabbit, cream coloured horse, or albino; for in them, the blood circulating in the choroid, is seen through the pupil, while in the common eye, the vessels are obscured by the pigmentum nigrum.

103 The LIGAMENTUM SACRO 1SCHIATICUM MINUS, OT ANTK- rius, will be seen above the last, rising from the sides of the sacrum and os coccygis, and attached to the spine of the ischium. The os coccygis is united, in early life, to the sacrum, by ligaments analogous to those of the bodies of the ver- tebrae; but no distinct ligaments can now be shown, for the bands covering the anterior and posterior parts of the bone, are merely continuations from the Ligamenla Vaga, which connect the bones of the sacrum. The ossa pubis are united together by an intermediate cartilage, which has a considerable similarity to the in- tervertebral substance. It has been called the Commis- sura Ossium Pubis, and is strengthened by a ligament, to which the name of Annulus Ligumentosus has been given. The obturator foramen is all closed by the Membrana Oblurans, except a small portion at the upper part, which is for the transmission of the obturator artery and nerve. The Poupart’s ligament is sometimes described as one holding the bones of the pelvis together. It is cu- rious that Weitbrecht calls this the “ vexatissimum ligamentum.” It may be truly so called still. Poupart first described it,from the dissection of a goat; and since his time, up to this day, there has always been a dispute, whether it is a distinct ligament, or only part of the ten- don of the external oblique muscle. Weitbrecht considers it as a separate ligament; and this is probably the most correct view. But we shall not say more upon it, as it has been already sufficiently dwelt upon in the descrip- tion of the abdominal muscles. TABLE OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. (on the upper part.) 1.

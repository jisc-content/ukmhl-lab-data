XV INTRODUCTION. likely way of giving him that peculiar command of the knife, which is so important for a surgeon to possess, and which cannot be attained except by much practice. In proof of this, we see that when even a man who is naturally dexterous, takes the knife into his hand for the first time, he appears awkward ; and the spectators at once perceive, that he is not fami- liar with the use of the instrument. Much of the appearance of dexterity, and even real dexterity, being dependant on the manner in which an instrument is held, we ought to study what is the best and neatest mode; taking care, however, to avoid the appearance of affectation. To perform almost any dissection, or operation, the knife should be held nearly in the same manner as we do a pen ; the motions should be executed with the fingers and wrist only,—for in this way, the incisions will be made with more freedom and precision, than they can, when the shoulder, elbow, and hand are moved at each cut; which they must, if the knife be held between the thumb and all the four fingers. It has been said, that Mr. Hunter used to hold his knife in this manner; but on asking an old and favourite pupil of Mr. Hunter, and who is yet famous for his dex- terity in operating, and neatness in dissecting, whether this was true, he told me, that it was so; but that the joint of Mr. Hunter’s thumb was stiff, in conse- quence of an accident. The student will find, that he requires several in- struments, besides those generally put into the dis- secting case, to enable him to make some of the more difficult dissections.—Thus, for example, he could not dissect the nerves of the spine, nor of the head, without a small saw, two or three chisels of different sizes, a small mallet, and the strong pincers, (that are used to pull out nails); the knife (called a hacking knife), which is used by plumbers to cut

42 formed principally by the veins from the lower extre- mities; but we shall find that the veins of the kidney and the testicle also run into it. We may observe that the left emulgent vein, as it crosses over the aorta, is much longer than the right; and that the left spermatic vein almost always joins the left emulgent, while the right passes direct into the vena cava. The cava occasionally receives some branches from the lumbar veins ; it then passes up towards the diaphragm,—sometimes it passes through a hole of the liver,—which must be recollected in removing this viscus ; but it is more commonly co- vered by a portion of the liver, which forms an arch : just as it is passing through the diaphragm it receives the vena cava; hepaticae, and the phrenic veins. TABLE OF THE ARTERIES WHICH ARE SENT OFF FROM THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. I. PHRENICA DEXTRA. II. PHRENICA SINISTRA. III. CCELIACA. IV. MESENTERICA SUPERIOR. V. MESENTERICA INFERIOR. VI. CAPSULARES. VII. RENA LIS DEXTRA ET RENALIS SINISTRA. VIII. SPERMATICA DEXTRA ET SPERMAT1CA SINISTRA. IX. SMALL BRANCHES WHICH GO TO THE URETERS, FAT, &c. X. LUMBALES. I. & II. PHRENICA DEXTRA & PHRENICA SINISTRA, give branches to the Diaphragm, inosculating with the Mannnaripe Interna;, and also irregular brandies to the Pan- creas, to the Membranes of the Liver, and to the Spleen. III. CCELIACA, from which come, 1. Coronaria Ventriculi Superior; 2. Hepatica; 3. Splenica. From the Coronaria Ventriculi Superior there come two sets of branches, viz. a superior division to the Stomach, to the CEsophagus, to the Diaphragm and Omentum Minus; and the inferior division, to the Lesser Curvature of the Stomach, and the Pyl orica Superior. From the Hepatica.—1st. The Hepatica Dexlra, which gives off the Cystica—2d. Hepatica Sinistra. Sometimes, 3d. Coronaria Dextra—4th. Duodeno Gastrica. The lesser

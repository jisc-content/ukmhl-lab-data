PLATE IV This plate does not represent a directly transverse plane section, but an oblique one. In order to bring the relation of the ear well into view the section is taken obliquely backwards and upwards. It commenced close under the nose, and has involved in its course to the external meatus the inferior turbinated bone, the upper portion of the pharynx, the right Eustachian tube, the tympanum and the external meatus, and passing out through the pons Yarolii, has divided the upper half of the cerebellum and the posterior lobe of the cerebrum above the external occipital protu- berance. The preparation was made from the body of a young man, which presented nothing abnormal. As the section in the posterior half of the left side passes higher than in the right, it is nearer the roof of the left tympanum, whilst on the right it approaches its floor. I convinced myself, however, from many sections, that if there be any' deviation of the saw from the proper direction it is not possible to make a thoroughly symmetrical preparation. In this plate the objects of chief importance are the relations of the right organ of hearing, the section of which has been so fortunate, that not only the external meatus and the tympanum, but also the first part of the Eustachian tube as well, have been divided. I was never again able to obtain the parts together to such an extent, although I made more than twelve sections in the same direction. Owing to individual variations in the base of the skull in the direction of the Eustachian tube, it is impos- sible to give any exact definitions for making such a section. As the chief points of interest lie in the upper half of the section, it will be represented instead of the lower half as in preceding plates; conse- quently one looks from below upwards into the skull, and the parts lying on the right side are really those of the left side and vice versa.

141 PLATE XVII section which passes through it near its middle includes a portion of its neck, and therefore produces externally a cut surface very far removed from a circle. The inner contour only would present a portion of a circle, namely at the point of insertion of the ligamentum teres. The component portion of the joint is better seen higher up. Fig. 4 is taken from a series of sections on the body of an old man, Fig. 4. Section of the pelvis of an old man at the level of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. 1,1. Head of thigh bone. 2. Rectum. 3. Apex of bladder. 4,4. Femoral vessels. 5. Lower end of sacrum. 6, 6. Gluteus maximus. somewhat higher than Plate XVII, and is therefore useful in comparison with it, since it traverses the entire length of the sacro-sciatic ligament. The acetabula are divided nearly through their centre. Nothing more of the symphysis pubis is to be seen, as in consequence of the greater inclination of the pelvis it lies considerably deeper. The relation of the vasa deferentia to the femoral vessels is well shown. Corresponding with the deeper position of the viscera in old persons already mentioned, a quantity of coils of small intestine are here shown, whereas on Plate XYII there is merely a small flat section of the ileum.

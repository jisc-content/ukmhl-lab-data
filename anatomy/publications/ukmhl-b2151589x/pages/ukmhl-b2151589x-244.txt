PLATE XXV 178 head of the humerus from the glenoid cavity was somewhat over half an inch; hence it would appear likely that in inflammation with effusion into the cavity of the joint, there would be some considerable lengthening of the limb. In order to bring the relations of the heart more completely into notice, it became necessary to extend the section farther downwards than was possible in this preparation. Consequently I made a series of sections to supply this deficiency, but unfortunately none of these specimens could be used to supplement this plate.

PLATE XIX 150 Fig. 1. joint represented in Plate XIX no such separation is to be seen. The fluid injected lias penetrated into all the portions and hollows of the joint, and has raised up the posterior wall of the capsule, so that the posterior portion of the condyle of the femur is brought into view. The ligamentum mucosum of the patella and the ante- rior crucial ligament lie in the plane of section. It is well known that Bon- net was the first to apply the method of injection to the in- vestigation of joints, and to prove thereby what position of the joint corresponded with the greatest distension of the synovial cavity. It appeared in all joints that it was the po- sition of flexion that allowed of the greatest amount of fluid entering the articular cavity; and that, with strong pressure of injection, all joints, no matter what position they may have had beforehand, acquire the position of flexion and maintain it so long as the pressure is continued. It is natural to suppose also that in diseases of the joint, associated with effusion into the synovial cavity, the position of flexion which the patients involuntarily affect is brought about by the direct pressure of the fluid. But against such a supposition the following points may be adduced, as can be well explained after consideration of this plate. The capacity of the joint-cavity also depends on the possibility of the Longitudinal section of the frozen knee-joint of a full-grown man. 5. 1. Femur. 2. Tibia. 3. Patella. 4.

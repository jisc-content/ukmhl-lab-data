PLATE XIV 120 from a considerable protrusion of the anterior wall of the abdomen, which is observable after each full meal, the lower ribs also must give wayâ€”a circumstance which, under a continued swelling of the abdomen, leads even to permanent prominence of the thoracic segment, as may be proved in many ways, and is especially seen in children. The left lobe of the liver must follow more or less the movements of the stomach, since it forms a species of covering to that organ; it is lifted up by the distended stomach, pushing the pericardium up with it, and sinks down with the contracting stomach, the place of which is taken partially by the left flexure of the colon. The mesentery-like left coronary ligament of the liver renders pos- sible such movements of its left lobe, which are associated either with a turning of the entire liver (the axis of which is to be sought in the right lobe, corresponding with the strong, firm attachments to the right half of the diaphragm), or arise from the yielding or distension of the soft tissues. Fig. 3 reduced from Pirogoff will make this relation clear, even if one does not obtain an entirely correct idea of the form and position of the left lobe of the liver. From this cut it is clear that the spleen lies so far back that any deter- mination of its posterior limits by percussion is impossible. It is true that by percussing in a horizontal direction around the thorax towards the spine, at the level of the spleen, we obtain a different sound as we approach the spine; but from the present plates one would not be warranted in assuming the existence of an air-containing organ between the spleen and the spine. We must look for the cause in the alteration of the elasticity of the ribs at this point. Further, we always find, if we percuss in a vertical direction on the back and in the axilla from above downwards, that the commencement of the dulness is in a horizontal line, corre- sponding with the limit of the base of the lung, and covering the superior portion of the spleen, which' is directed obliquely downwards and for- wards. One can easily convince oneself of the firm position of the spleen, which is especially owing to the reflexion of the peritoneum, under the name of phenico-splenic ligament, if the upper portion of the thorax be removed on the dead body, and the sac of peritoneum preserved,

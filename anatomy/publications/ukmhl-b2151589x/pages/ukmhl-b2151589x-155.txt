From observations that I instituted on different subjects, after filling the colon from the anus, or the stomach from the oesophagus, in order to demonstrate the variation in position of the organs in one and the same Fig. 2.

The stomach was much displaced from its natural position, and was emptied with as much difficulty as the colon; so that I was forced either to use different subjects for the plate, or to select from them those which showed the organs in the state of distension desired. It appeared in the highest degree remarkable that in a portion of the trunk, to which merely the under half of the thorax was attached, one could inject a large quantity of water through the oesophagus, and leave it any length of time without its escaping.

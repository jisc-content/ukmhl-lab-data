PLATE VII 67 The muscular masses which compose the posterior half of the central part of the plate may be thoroughly analysed, and they are suffi- ciently distinguishable from the references. It should be here observed that on the left side the section has passed above the serratus magnus, whereas on the right side its upper edge only is involved, and is in such close relation with the levator anguli scapulge that no clear line of demar- cation can be shown. On the left side, in the separation between the levator anguli scapulge and the trapezius (cucullaris), and over the upper border of the serratus magnus, lies the transversalis colli artery, which is divided through its curve. Its course is clearly shown from the outer side of the scalenus medius, and its relation to the superficial cervical artery; up to this point it applies itself posteriorly to the trapezius and levator anguli scapulae, in order to terminate in the region of the angle of the scapula; on the right side this vessel is seen merely in section. The trapezius forms the largest surface of the section and is divided just at the point of its fan-shaped expansion. The posterior fibres run more transversely to the acromion and acromial end of the clavicle, and are therefore cut parallel to their course; the mass of fibres lying on the anterior border are more perpendicular to the middle portion of the clavicle, and are divided almost transversely. The spinal accessory nerve is shown in this muscle.

PLATE XXI Fig. 1 of this plate is a section of the thigh taken somewhat below the upper third, about 2-5 inches below the section shown in the preceding plate, and three inches below the trochanter minor. The individual portions of the quadriceps extensor are clearly seen separated from each other by fascia. At the posterior border of the vastus externus, which is covered by the strong dense fascial tendon of the tensor vaginas femoris, is the termination of the gluteus maximus. This muscle is attached by means of a strong tendinous mass to the thigh bone, and here separates the flexor muscles from the extensors. Of the flexors which accompany the ischiatic nerve the biceps and semitendinosus are now completely separate. The semimembranosus has already become muscular. Over it lie the three adductorsâ€”first, the adductor magnus; upon it the adductor brevis ; and between this and the adductor longus the profunda artery and obtu- rator nerve. On the other side of the adductor longus, between it and the vastus internus, is the space for the femoral artery and vein. The sheath of the vessel is clearly seen ; its formation by fascial lamime; and its closing-in by the sartorius, which continually approaches the inner side of the thigh. This muscle reaches the gracilis, to which it is very similar in form, getting closer and closer to it until at last the two muscles accompany each other. Fig. 2 represents a section through the middle of the thigh, where the sartorius and gracilis meet, and the short head of the biceps begins to take the place of the gluteus in the external intermuscular ligament, between the vastus externus and the flexors. External to the rectus femoris the individual portions of the quadriceps are not seen any more, the rectus with its central tendon being completely isolated by fascia. 21

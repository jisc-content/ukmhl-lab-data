f 77 PLATE XXY section. Nevertheless the outer side of the subscapularis is to be seen on the left shoulder-joint limited by a dark line, indicating the synovial mem- brane in section. This line runs in a curved direction with its concavity outwards, corresponding with the head of the humerus. In order to demonstrate the extent of the cavity of the capsular liga- ment and to show the amount of separation of the humerus from the scapula when the joint is distended by effusion, I injected some fresh joints with tallow, froze them, and then made sections. One of these pre- parations is shown in the following woodcut. Frontal section of the right shoulder-joint, injected with tallow. Anterior half. ยง. 1. Head of humerus. 2. Neck of scapula. 3. Anterior margin of scapula. 4. Clavicle. 5. Deltoid. 6. Triceps. 7. Teres major. 8. Teres minor. 9. Infra-spinatus. 10. Supra-spinatus. 11. Trapezius. The humerus is seen from behind half extended and somewhat rolled inwards, a position it accpiired from the great pressure of the injection, and corresponding with the greatest amount of distension of the capsule. This injection was made from the supra-spinous fossa through the glenoid cavity, and the upper arm amputated at its lower end, so as not to hamper the move- ments of the joint by its weight. It appeared that the greatest distance of the 23

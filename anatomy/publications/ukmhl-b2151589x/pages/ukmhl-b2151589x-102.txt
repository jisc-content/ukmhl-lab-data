LEEDS & WEST-RIO INC ^TDiOO-CHIRURClCAL SOCIETY PLATE VTTT This plate represents the upper surface of the last section made from an uninjected body, which has also afforded material for the previous plates; it is therefore unnecessary to mention anything further with regard to this body, as the essentials will be found with the explanation of Plate Y. The section is so made that it passes directly through both subclavian arteries at the level of the arches which they describe over the cupola of the lung, and very fortunately the trunk of the left subclavian artery remains intact; whilst that of the right side is divided together with that portion of the lung which lies immediately beneath it. It extends moreover to the level of the isthmus of the thyroid body, to the lower edge of the first dorsal vertebra, and to the coracoid process of the humerus above the tuberosities. One consequence of the high position of the shoulders of this individual is, that the lateral portions of the shoulder-joint are seen in this section, whilst in the case of less powerfully developed bodies they are not met with till the level of the sterno-clavicular articulation is reached. With regard to the relations of the spinal column, we first notice a small portion of the body of the under surface of the first dorsal vertebra, behind it the connexion between it and the second, which in consequence of the curvature of the spinal column has been sawn through obliquely. Small portions of the transverse processes of the second dorsal vertebra appear behind the intervertebral substance. The second ribs are seen attached to these processes and also to the bodies of the vertebrae. In the mass of muscle in front of them lie the first ribs in section. Nothing is seen of the sternum and the sternal end of the clavicle, since these

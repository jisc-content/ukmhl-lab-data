PLATE Y This plate and Nos. 6, 7, and 8, are made from sections of one and the same body. The region of the neck was cut in five series of planes of wliicli the upper surface of each is represented and analysed, it is viewed from above downwards. The right side of the drawing is the right side of the preparation. Owing to this cutting into planes, the explanation of the individual outlines becomes considerably more difficult than had the sections been made on different bodies. By making very thin sections the arrangement of the muscles of the nape of the neck were very difficult of definition. On the other hand, this proceeding affords the great advantage that the under surface of each section fits exactly on the upper surface of the one next following it, and also that the separate organs, such as the thyroid body and larynx, which show pretty con- siderable individual differences with reference to size and position, can be analysed by transverse sections which mutually correspond. The body, which was of fine proportions and perfectly normal, was quite fresh, and was about twenty-five years of age. The muscular development was good. After the arteries had been injected, the trunk, from which the lower extremities were removed, was frozen in the usual manner, with the arms close to the side, and prepared as has been before described. In consequence of the great muscular development the shoulders were very high, and therefore the neck appears to be comparatively short. It is not, then, to be wondered at that sections at the level of corresponding vertebra in respect to the region of the shoulder, differ from those represented by Pirogoff (fasc. i, tab. ii), which were made from a person less thoroughly developed. Fig. 1 corresponds nearly with Pirogoff (fasc. i, tab. lx, fig. 1), and 7

PLATE XXII the artery in this place than higher up (vide Plates XX and XXI). This and tlie following plates are taken from sections from another body, but can be used equally well in the series. The arteries were injected, the body frozen lying on the back, and the lower extremities left in their normal position, i. e. somewhat rotated outwards. Fig. 1. The section here passed through the lower third of the thigh nearly a handâ€™s breadth above the upper border of the knee, at the position of the passage of the artery through the adductor opening. The plate represents the left thigh, and the upper surface of the lower portion; the external aspect of the extremity being to the left, and the internal to the right. The adductor longus is not seen, as it terminated just above the line of section. Of the adductors the magnus only is present; its section is associated with the great vessels. It is no longer attached to the linea aspera, but all the muscular tissue to be seen here passes directly into its tendon, which terminates at the internal condyle of the femur. This is exactly the spot where the artery passes through the adductor opening, in order to reach the back of the bone. The artery itself lies surrounded by a system of veins, which render ligature a matter of difficulty, on account of their free anastomosis. Between the artery and the bone lies the vein, with two small ones opening into it; on the opposite side are two vense comites, which are lodged between the artery and the long saphena nerve. If the artery be tied at this level, the incision must be made between the sartorius and the internal vastus, but upon the outer side of the former; the strong dense fascia under the sartorius must be divided; and the saphena nerve and vense comites pulled on one side; there is thus more difficulty in reaching and isolating

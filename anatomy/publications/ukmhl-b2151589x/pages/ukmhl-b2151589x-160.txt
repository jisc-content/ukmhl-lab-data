PLATE XIII 114 settled by allowing a body to be frozen, and to expose the right auricle with the venae cavae from behind with hammer and chisel. Transverse sections, like the one under observation, where the vena cava and the entrance of the hepatic vein are cut through immediately below the foramen quadratum, throw little light on the question; nor can much be expected from experiment or clinical observation. Researches on animals, which I have instituted in Ludwigâ€™s laboratory, and published in the reports of the Academy, show that ligature of the inferior vena cava does not set up any considerable disturbance of the circulation, as the blood finds a ready path collateral^ by means of the azygos veins and spinal plexus, thus getting into the superior vena cava.

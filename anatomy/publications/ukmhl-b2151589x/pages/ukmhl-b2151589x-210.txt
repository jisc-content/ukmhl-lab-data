156 PLATE XIX There is no necessity for mentioning the individual parts. The accurate drawing itself sufficiently explains the soft parts. Some notice must be taken of the pad of fat which is so largely developed at the point of greatest pressure on the sole, and which diminishes and distributes as much as possible this pressure over different points. Over the heel and in the region of the ball of the great toe it is half an inch thick; thus affording a soft support, which partially equalises the irregularities of the ground.

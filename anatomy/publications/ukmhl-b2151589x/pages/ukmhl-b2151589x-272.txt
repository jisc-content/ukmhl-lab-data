196 PLATES XXTX and XXX descending cornu of the right lateral ventricle with the pes hippocampi. Beneath the dura mater, in the right half of the preparation, a portion of the Gasserian ganglion and some fibres of the fifth nerve are seen. The relations of the skeleton, however, are of the greatest import- ance. I had therefore, after all the plates were drawn, the halves of the skeleton macerated, and the parts as accurately as possible adjusted with regard to each other, as represented in the adjoining woodcut. It pre- sents a slightly scoliosed pelvis, with a like condition of the spine. It shows moreover that the deviation of the line of section from the middle line was not so considerable as the plate might suggest. The section passed through the pelvis, as near as possible in the middle line, externally and to the right of the lumbar vertebras, meeting the dorsal at their articulation with the ribs, and passing again in the cervical region to the middle of the spinal column, and subsequently again to the right in the skull. Beyond the scoliosed condition of the spine there was nothing worthy of remark, except that there were two cervical ribs, one complete on the right side, and a rudimentary one on the left side of the seventh cervical vertebra. There were seven cervical vertebrae, but only eleven dorsal and five lumbar. There was a rudimentary process from the fifth lumbar which was attached to the upper portion of the sacrum. The measurements of the pelvis in inches were as follows :—The conjugata vera 3'8 in. (the conjugata at the narrowest points being 3‘7); the right sacro-cotyloid 2’8 in. ; the left sacro-cotyloid 3*2 in.; the transverse diameter 5'8 in. ; the left oblique diameter, 5’08 in., and the right oblique diameter 5’6 inches. The sacrum was 4’5 in. deep and 4-8 in. broad. The question arises whether, in a weak obliquely contracted pelvis, showing such a variation, child-birth be possible without surgical aid.

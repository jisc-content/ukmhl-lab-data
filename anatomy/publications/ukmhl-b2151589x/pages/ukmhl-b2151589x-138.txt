96 PLATE XI like a cord from the inner surface of the ribs to the lung, there are other and wider bands which divide the pleural cavity into three portions. The left lung is, moreover, very much compressed and adherent to the costal pleura, so that its section appears polygonal. As the normal relations of the thoracic organs have been exhaustively treated of by Luschka, Henle, Meyer, and others, I must refer the reader to their works, and proceed with a description of certain results of observations on dislocation of the heart from collections of fluid in the pleural cavities. Pig. 3 shows the normal relations of the heart to the anterior wall of the chest, as determined from numerous examinations which I have Pig. 3. Fig. 4. Normal position of the heart, a. Dislocation of the heart. Pleuritic exudation on the left side, a. made on young male subjects. After injecting the heart, and using only moderate pressure, the left auricular appendix became more visible than is usually the case when it is empty. Fig. 4 represents a very considerable dislocation of the heart to the right side, produced by pleuritic effusion. The body lying on the back, the heart was fixed to the anterior and posterior walls of the thorax by six long needles, and the position of each portion accurately defined

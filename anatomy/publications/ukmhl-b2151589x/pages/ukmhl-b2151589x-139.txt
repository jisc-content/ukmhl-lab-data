PLATE XI 97 with regard to the anterior wall of the chest. It will be observed that the dislocation of the heart is considerably greater as regards its apex than its base, and that at the same time a rotation towards the right side on the long axis has taken place, so that a greater projection of the left ventricle has resulted. The vertical position of the heartâ€™s axis in this instance was determined by exact measurement. The following woodcuts (5 and 6) also show dislocation of the heart from effusion into the pleural cavities. They are, however, the results of experiments which were made by myself on fresh normal bodies. Fig. 5. Left lateral hydrothorax, artificial, -pli. Fig. 6. Right lateral hydrothorax, artificial, ph. The bodies were placed in the upright position and care was taken that the tracheae remained open, and that the other parts were in their normal positions, and disregarding any experiment which did not seem to be com- plete, the conditions shown in the accompanying woodcuts were obtained. After finishing the experiments by injecting a weak solution of common salt, the trachea was closed, so that on opening the thorax any farther falling together of the lungs should be impossible. The heart was fixed to the anterior and posterior walls of the thorax with long needles, and the intercostal spaces subsequently opened, in order to determine the position of the heart with regard to the framework of the chest. It was found that 13

168 PLATE XXIII The course the knife must take in order to expose the fibula is indicated by the fibular intermuscular septum. The muscles which bound this septum, the peroneus brevis and extensor proprius pollicis, are easily made out at the outer surface of the bone, and the plate assists the surgeon in judging of the depth the wound should be in muscular individuals. In this proceeding no vessels of large size will be met with, but the peroneal nerve must be carefully avoided, as it would fall in the line of incision. The superficial position of the tibia also demands attention with regard to the treatment of ulcers, as the periosteum is all the more likely to be involved the fat being so sparingly developed, whilst in almost all other points of the section it is more abundant and consequently the skin is further from the subjacent fasciae. The main arteries, with their accompanying veins, at this level are still tolerably near their origins, and not very far separated from each other. In the inner portion of the section they lie so near the interosseous ligament, and are so protected from external pressure by the bones of the leg, that they are not so liable to be wounded as elsewhere. At the same time from their position they are not readily compressible against the skeleton, so that in amputation or any operation where much bleeding is expected a tourniquet must be applied above the knee.

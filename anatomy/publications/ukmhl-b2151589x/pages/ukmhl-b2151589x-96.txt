PLATE YII This plate and those which immediately precede and succeed it are taken from one and the same body. Here, as is evident, the superior surface is represented. The section, commencing immediately below the larynx, passes through the under edge of the cricoid cartilage, and involves the lateral lobes of the thyroid body, the under surface of the seventh cervical vertebra, and a portion of the intervertebral fibro-cartilage. It terminates at the level of the articulation between the acromion and clavicle. As can be verified by measurement, the lateral halves are of equal length, and there is consider- able symmetry in the arrangement of the individual portions, so that the track of the saw is exactly horizontal, and yet there are many differences on the two sides of the section. On the right side the part between the clavicle and acromion is opened, and a portion of the muscular mass of the serratus magnus crops up from the scapula; the head of the first rib is also plain. On the left side the section passes beneath the articulation between the clavicle and acromion, and neither the rib nor the angle of scapula can be seen. It will be observed, then, that in normal and faultlessly â€™ formed bodies deviations from lateral symmetry may occur, a fact which does not permit representations of sections of one half of the body only being made. As the section passed through the point of junction of the cervical with the dorsal vertebrae, it represents the area between the back and the neck. In front of the vertebra the section keeps completely within the region of the neck which descends lower down in front than it does behind. The clavicle can be observed in considerable length through the integu- ment. This relation must be borne in mind in examining deep-seated gun-

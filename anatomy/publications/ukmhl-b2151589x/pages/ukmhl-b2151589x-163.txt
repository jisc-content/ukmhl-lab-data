PLATE XIY This plate represents a section through the epigastrium, exposing the liver, stomach, and spleen. No more is to be seen of the lungs; the black line immediately internal to the ribs represents the pleural cavity, whilst close to it is the diaphragm, appearing as a muscular ring. The structures lying external to it belong to the thorax, and internal to the diaphragm is the abdominal cavity. The plate is taken from the upper surface of a section fwo inches thick from the same body as the preceding and the following. The body of the eleventh dorsal vertebra is seen divided near its under surface, so that a small piece of the interarticular fibro-cartilage is shown. The arch lying behind it also belongs to the eleventh dorsal ver- tebra : the joint spaces in front belong to the articular processes of the twelfth: and on either side are the sections of the eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, and sixth ribs ; the seventh and sixth ribs being divided twice, but not the xiphoid cartilage, since the section passes below it. It appears strange, at first sight, that the section of the right half of the body should have a larger area than the left, the transverse diameters differing by about half an inch; the cause of this is, however, in some measure, owing to a want of symmetry, and also to the fact that the saw- blade diverged somewhat from the horizontal plane. The liver occupies the greatest amount of space, and is perfectly normal in structure and weight. The left lobe of the liver is prolonged into a thin lamina, which is stretched over the stomach almost as far as the spleen. This explains the great extent of the liver in the left cupola of the diaphragm, in the preceding plate. At the point of junction of the right and left lobes, in the left longitudinal fossa, is the ligamentum teres in a fold of peritoneum; and posteriorly, lying on the diaphragm, the

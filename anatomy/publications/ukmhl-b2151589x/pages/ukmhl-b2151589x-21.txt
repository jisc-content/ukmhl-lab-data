SEWOO-CWRUB^tAL SOOiST 1 TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY PLATE I (a, b) The accompanying plate was taken from the body of a powerful, well-built, perfectly normal man, aged 21, who liad banged bimself. Tbe organs exhibited no pathological irregularities. The body, which was brought in unfrozen, was placed on a horizontal board, without any special support for the head, and it was only by laying it down that provision could be made for the limbs lying as symmetrically as possible with regard to the mesial line. In this position the subject lay untouched in the open air, and at a temperature of about 50° F., for fourteen days. At the end of this time the process of freezing was com- menced and completed. The mesial line of the body was next accurately marked out anteriorly and posteriorly Avith a black line, and the section carefully performed by means of a broad, fine-edged saw, much in the same way as two workmen would saw the trunk of a tree. After cleansing the surface, the right half of the body showed that a most successful section had been made. In the brain the fifth ventricle had been traversed ; in the thorax the mediastinum, so that neither of the pleurm was opened; and in the pelvis the upper third of the urethra. The tracing was then taken from the frozen surface. Where the course of the section had not exactly kept the mesial plane, I improved the preparation subsequently in such places as" the nature of the case required. Thus, a thin slice of the cerebellum was removed by means of a razor, and the entire course of the aqueeductus Sylvii exposed down to the fourth ventricle, with the penile portion of the urethra and the anus where not opened in the middle line. The plane of

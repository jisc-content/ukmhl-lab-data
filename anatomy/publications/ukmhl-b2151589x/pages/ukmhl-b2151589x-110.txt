PLATE VIII 74 nearly an inch more tlian in the old man, whereas the antero-posterior diameter is half an inch more in the old than in the young man. Plate IX in the large atlas should not be incorporated with the series of the plates, as in the old man more abnormalities exist. There was a considerable enlargement of the liver, and a very great development of the thyroid body, so that the relations of the parts in the neck (as seen in Plate XXY) are much altered. The thyroid gland was enlarged below and on the left side, so as to encroach on a portion of the superior aperture of the thorax. It also pressed the left subclavian artery inwards and backwards upon the cupola of the lung; the oesophagus also was pushed out of its place against the trachea, embedding itself between it and the vertebral column. The relation of the carotid artery to the sixth cervical vertebra has been already described, and it has been stated that the position of the arteries is to be defined not by the bone, but by the directions of the muscles and fascise, and that the bony prominences alone should not be con- sidered of value as landmarks for finding the arteries. The same remark applies to the veins, nerves, trachea, and oesophagus in the region of the neck. These structures are so freely movable in the anterior region of the neck that the movements of the trunk or the pressure of a tumour may materially alter their position. This is particularly evident in Plate IX in the larger coloured atlas; it can be estimated also in the present plate. Such a change of position with regard to the skeleton is owing to the presence of the loose cellular tissue which envelopes these structures. But the relation of these important structures with regard to the muscles and fascise is constant, and consequently if an operation such as trache- otomy, oesophagotomy, or the extirpatiou of a tumour, has to be per- formed, the surgeon must make himself well acquainted with the fascise and muscles.

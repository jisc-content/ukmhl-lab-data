PLATE XXVI The longitudinal section shown in this plate is taken through the elbow-joint and hand of a young normal female subject, wTith no previous injection of the vessels. There was neither artificial injection of the articulation nor any pre- determined position thereof. It was frozen and sawn through in its normal condition. Figure 1. In this plate is shown the sagittal section of the righÂ£ elbow-joint, taken somewhat obliquely, and seen from the radial aspect. The saw has passed nearly through its centre, and removed a small portion of the radial surface of the ulna. As the forearm is slightly bent, and in semipronation, the radius is met with in its long axis, a small portion of the ulnar aspect of its head only remaining. Farther down its shaft is divided obliquely, and the medullary cavity partially opened. In consequence of pronation the radius does not lie parallel with the ulna but crosses it, and is directed with its inferior extremity forwards. The expansion of the cavity of the elbow-joint is worthy of notice in flexion and extension of the humerus. The folding-in of the capsular liga- ment in the posterior supra-trochlear fossa corresponds with the slight degree of flexion, and if this flexion be further increased, this folding-in would become eradicated and take place on the anterior aspect. The cavities above the trochlea are alternately filled at the end of flexion and extension, the capsule, however, being drawn away beforehand by certain muscles, viz. the brachialis anticus and biceps, so that it may not be included between the bones. It can be seen from the plate that the bones do not lie completely

134 PLATE XYI sponding witli the curvature of the wall of the intestine), is from four fifths of an inch to one inch, supposing the intestine empty and con- tracted (at a level between the third and fourth lumbar vertebras); further, that the free side of the intestine, as in Plate XYI, does not look posteriorly but somewhat inwards, exactly towards the angle which the psoas and quadratus lumborum make with each other. If, on the other hand, the small intestines are much distended, the peritoneum between the psoas and colon would be pushed further downwards; and the colon, by means of the traction of tLe parietal portion of the perito- neum, would be rotated on its axis, so that its free surface would be directed more outwards. Should the colon itself be distended, its surface free of peritoneum becomes considerably larger, and may assume a breadth of from 2 to 2’5 inches. Tympanitis of the small intestine appears to have a rotatory influence on the distended colon ; and on comparing Pirogoff’s plates it is shown with its free surface turned somewhat outwards (cf. Pirogoff, iii, B, tab. xiv). In the performance of the operation of colotomy a distended abdomen will probably often be met with. I therefore do not consider these remarks superfluous, and I hope that they may contribute to make the avoidance of the peritoneum more certain than heretofore where it was so much left to chance; and, as a third part of the cases show wound of this membrane, the value of Amussat’s method appears problematical.

PLATE XVIII 148 As it appeared to me desirable to Lave a section showing these struc- tures rather farther back, I made one on the body of a normal well-built man, at such a depth as to pass through the prostatic portion of the urethra. The preceding woodcut represents the plate on a smaller scale. The head of the left femur is seen only as a small segment, and not in connection with the rest of the bone. The body of the ischium shows a large surface in section, corresponding with its more extensive development behind the acetabulum. The obturator membrane, ascending ramus of ischium, and the obturator externus and interims, still show some resemblance to the corresponding portions on Plate XVIII, and so also do the corpora cavernosa. We have, moreover, in the section, in place of the apex of the bladder, its posterior wall, and the posterior half of the prostate, with the caput gallinaginis. The membranous portion of the urethra and the prostate are opened. On both sides of it are the deep transverse perineal muscles, the fibres of which are expanded towards the middle line. Above is seen the anterior mass of the levator ani. Around it is a layer of fascia, the upper portion of which is continuous with the pelvic and the lower with the perineal fascias. Both fascise meet at the inner border of the levator ani muscle, and help to support the prostate. The upper lamina of the perineal fascia and the lower surface of the transversus perinei pass forwards. The plate, which must not be regarded as diagrammatic, agrees in all its essential particulars tolerably accurately with Henle (‘ Eingeweidelehre,’ p. 504, fig. 392), which should be compared with it.

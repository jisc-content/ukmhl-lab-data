PLATE XYI The section in this case passes through the navel dividing the soft parts just above the iliac crest, and the inter-vertebral space between the third and fourth lumbar vertebras. The ribs are no longer seen, and the section is now below the thorax and through the middle of the abdomen. The walls of the abdominal cavity are formed, anteriorly and laterally entirely by the three oblique muscles, behind by the quadratus lumborum and the strong ligaments together with the psoas magnus of both sides. The posterior wall, where no spinous processes are visible, is very thick and strong, and formed by the mass of the dorsal muscles. The contents of the abdominal cavity are the great vessels and ureters, the ascending transverse and descending colon, and the small intestines. The contents of the intestines were carefully removed in order to allow of these viscera being accurately represented in situ. The section is from the same body as the preceding, and is taken about two inches lower down. Before explaining the details here represented, I have to make some few remarks on the kidneys. They lie entirely above this section and within the region of the ribs, higher than is frequently supposed, and as many are accustomed to seek them. Hence their position may be consi- dered as an independent one as regards the movements of the diaphragm or enlargements of the liver and spleen. I think I can prove that in both respects the relations are otherwise, and that the position of the kidneys is unchangeable. Both kidneys extend over the bodies of three and a half vertebrae, and reach from the upper border of the twelfth dorsal downwards to the middle of the third lumbar ; and it is to be remarked that they do not lie exactly on the same level, but that the left rises somewhat higher than the right.

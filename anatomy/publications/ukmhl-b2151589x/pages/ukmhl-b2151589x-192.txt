PLATE XYII 138 Between tliese fasciculi, on the left side, lie the internal pudic vessels and nerves ; on the right they are further off, and are to be looked for near the spine of the ischium. Internally on either side from the sacro-spinous ligament is a dark band, partly prolonged to the spine of -the ischium and partly associated with the fascia of the obturator internus; this is the superior portion of the levator ani. This muscle closes-in the cavity of the pelvis like a muscular funnel, and consequently may not be inaptly com- Fig. l. Transverse section of the pelvis of a boy, set. 15.

All sections which divide the bladder further downwards must therefore fall within the region of this muscle, and expose it as a muscular ring limiting the pelvic organs. Such a section is shown in the following figure. Fig. 2 represents a section that I made on the pelvis of an old man. It passes through the symphysis; on the left side through the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen; on the right somewhat lower, through the tuberosity of the ischium; and posteriorly through the tip of the coccyx. The levator ani is seen bounding the pelvic cavity, which contains behind the rectum a coil

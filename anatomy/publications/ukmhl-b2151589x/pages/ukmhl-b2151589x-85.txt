PLATE Y 55 In the section also are seen the arytenoid glands, many of which are embedded on the inner side of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. The thyro-arytenoideus and the arytenoideus are divided through their upper extremities. From the arrangement of the muscles, the resemblance to a sphincter can be clearly recognised. Behind this layer of muscles lies the large mass of glands of the pharynx—the middle arytenoid gland of Lnschka. The common carotid artery is shown exactly in the position which would be most suitable for its ligature; its relations should be carefully noticed. It is at the spot where the deviation of the omo-hyoid and sterno-cleido-mastoid allows of a ready means of access. However incompletely the relations of the fasciae in such a plate are rendered, one can see clearly that the vessel must be sought on the anterior border of the sterno-cleido-mastoid, and that after the division of the hinder portion of its sheath the space containing the great vessels and nerves is immediately entered. In front of the artery is the descendens noni, and somewhat behind it is the internal jugular vein ; between the vein and artery is the vagus, and behind the artery is the sympathetic. Inside the sheath of the vessels a layer of cellular tissue isolates the artery from the vein and the nerve. The important part of the operation consists in opening the sheath of the artery, which lies immediately in front of the scalenus anticus muscle. If this be properly done, one not only avoids the danger of wounding the nerve, but the vein also will be kept at a distance. After opening the sheath the vein would expand enormously and cover up the whole field of operation.* * In ligature of the carotid pressure should be made on the internal jugular vein by the fingers of an assistant both above and below, in order to prevent this expansion of the vessel from interfering with the operator’s movements.—Tr.

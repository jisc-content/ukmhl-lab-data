PLATE XIII 110 could feel its wall between the cardiac extremity and the fundus jutting out so sharply as to form a distinct valve. It must remain for further investigations how far these relations on the subject can be applied to the living body. Fig. 3 shows the stomach empty, and the resulting space filled up on the left side by the colic flexure. The other relations are similar to the preceding. It appears in these plates that the heart always has the left lobe of the liver between it and the stomach, and lies on the stomach by only a portion of its apex, which may vary greatly in size.

Fig. 3. r 'a n r frontal section shows the same condition, and the order of these struc- tures as arranged one above the other can be well studied (compare Henke, ‘ Atlas der Top. Anat.,’ tab. xxxv, xxxvii, and Pirogoff, I A, ii a, ii b). It will also be seen that, according to the condition of the stomach, the position of the viscera in the left cupola of the diaphragm will be altered. The left flexure of the colon is pushed up if filled with gas and the stomach empty ; and will, as it more often contains air than the stomach, afford especially a full tympanitic percussion note in the lower half of the left

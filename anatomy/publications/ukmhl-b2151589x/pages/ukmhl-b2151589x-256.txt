PLATE XXVIII Fig. 1. The section here passes through the upper third of the left forearm, and the ulna and radius exhibit surfaces of almost equal size, only the ulna with its sharp edge lies closer to the surface than the radius, which is embedded in muscle. The ulna can be readily felt throughout the entire length of the forearm, but the head and inferior extremity only of the radius. The edge of the ulna affords an easily distinguishable limit between the flexor and extensor muscles. The flexor carpi radialis forms the muscular limit on the flexor surface. It is placed with its tendinous border on the ulna, and covers over the deep flexor lying beneath it. On the opposite side of the ulna is the origin of the interosseous ligament, and in connection therewith fascias, which pass directly upwards, and conse- quently separate both groups of muscles. To the left lie the supinators and extensors, and to the right the pronator teres and flexors. Between both groups of muscles are seen the vessels, the ulnar artery deep down, with the interosseous springing from it, and above it the radial. One needs merely to divide the enveloping fasciae, and to pull the muscle to one side to expose the radial artery. The deep position of the ulnar at this spot renders its ligature difficult. Of nerves the superficial branch of the radial is found below the supinator longus, the deep branch lying in the supinator brevis. The median is between the pronator teres and flexor sublimis digitorum, the ulnar between the latter and flexor carpi ulnaris. Peculiar interest is attached to the supinator brevis, the function of which can be readily understood by reference to this section. Passing out- wards from the ulna (its upper set of fibres from the epicondyle are not seen), it wraps round the radius so that it must by its contraction roll it outwards. The space between it and the radius is taken up by the tendon of the biceps, which from the nature of its attachment assists in supination.

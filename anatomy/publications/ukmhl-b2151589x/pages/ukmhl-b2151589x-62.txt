r$T;RfP |WC PLATE III Pirogoff, in liis works wliicli we have frequently cited, has carried out liis sections of the human body in three directions, and upon that attempts to establish its configuration. It might be expected, as a matter of course, that such a proceeding could be applicable in geometrical solids, but it is not sufficient in organised bodies, even if one divided such a body into as many thin lamince as possible. In organised bodies oblique sections in individual places show far more than purely sagittal, frontal, and transverse sections.* This is more particularly the case with the eye. Supposing it be desired to give not merely the relation of the globe, but to include the structures in its immediate neighbourhood, we must aim at bringing into view the connections of the eye with the optic nerve as far as possible up to the brain. It is of only secondary interest to determine in which horizontal plane behind the orbit the individual portions of the temporal lobe lie. In order to follow the course of the optic nerve as the relations on the skeleton indicate, we must direct the plane of section from the middle of the pupil, obliquely upwards. The idea of this proceeding had already struck Sommering, and in his monograph (‘ De Oculorum Hominis de sectione horizontali commentatio,’ Gottingse, 1818) a very useful plate is given, so also in Pirogoffs atlas (fasc. i, tab. iii, 4, 5). As follows from Sommering’s work, he employs the * These terms are in frequent use in this work, and imply respectively a vertical section by a plane passing through the structures in an antero-posterior direction, a section produced by a plane also passing vertically, but at right angles to the former, whilst a transverse section implies one made at right angles to the axis of the trunk or extremities.—Tr.

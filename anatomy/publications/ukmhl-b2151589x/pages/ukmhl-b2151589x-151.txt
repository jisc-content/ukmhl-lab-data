PLATE XIII The section of which the upper surface is here shown was taken two inches below the preceding*; and passed through the lower portion of the sternum and the fifth costal cartilage; divided the apex of the heart, the diaphragm, and the liver; and came out posteriorly through the lower portion of the ninth dorsal vertebra, and the corresponding rib. This plate terminates the series of sections of the thorax ; and the abdominal cavity is already open, showing at a glance how wounds of the liver may involve the lung. Although the left lobe of the liver lies in the section, a very small portion only of the left half of the cupola of the diaphragm has been removed. It rises as high as the lower border of the fourth rib, seen from the front; whilst the right half, of which considerably more has been removed than of the left, rises as high as its upper border— nearly a rib’s breadth higher, and almost on a level with the plane of the nipples. It has been already stated in the last chapter that this position of the diaphragm does not correspond with its relations during life, but that it was so found in the body of a young powerful man, and that it would be pushed higher up in tympanitis. The position of the heart is in immediate relation with the diaphragm and liver; and the lowest part of the heart is shown divided behind the fifth costal cartilage of the left side. The absolute apex of the heart is about four fifths of an inch from the plane of section. On the right side, in the apex of the right portion of the heart, is seen the lowest part of the cavity of the ventricle, filled with its columnse earne89. At the apex of the left side the section exhibits the arrangement of the muscular structure. 14

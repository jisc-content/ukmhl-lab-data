PLATE X 86 Fig. 1 is reduced from Plate XI of this Atlas. Pirogoff’s drawing, Fig. 2, which shows a body affected with left pneu- mothorax, was reversed and reduced so that it might be the more Fig. 1. Subject A.—Thorax. Male, set. 22. Normal.

The section, according to Pirogoff’s descrip- tion, passed through the second intercostal space, and divided the third, fourth, and fifth ribs to the lower border of the second dorsal vertebra, so that in subject 0 the sternum must have been placed considerably higher than in my preparation. Whilst the posterior osseous portion shows relations similar to mine, the sections through the sternum differ by a rib and an intercostal space. This elevated position of the sternum can be readily explained from the pneumothorax, and the emphysema existing on the right side. The left lung lies compressed upon the vertebrae by means of a pseudo- membranous cord which is attached to the wall of the chest; the right lung which is immensely distended by secondary emphysema, shows no folds in the pleura, such as are to be seen in my plates. The superior vena cava is compressed.

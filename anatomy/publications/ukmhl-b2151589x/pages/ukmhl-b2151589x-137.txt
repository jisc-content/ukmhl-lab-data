The commencement of the pulmonary artery lies behind the right Fig. 2. Subject C.—Adult male thorax. Left lateral pneumo-thorax. Pirogoff, ii, 7, 3, i. 1. Bronchi. 2. (Esophagus. 3.

Pirogoff’s section (cf. text to plate, £ Atlas,5 fasc. ii, p. 28) runs horizontally through the upper border of the third costal cartilage, dividing the third, fourth, and fifth ribs of both sides; it passes also through the upper border of the fifth dorsal vertebra. Here the section passes a vertebra higher than in my case; this resulted from the expansion of the thorax, and the position of the ribs consequent on inspiration. It is remarkable that both right and left sides of the thorax are equally raised, so that they show a closely symmetrical division of the ribs. Besides the local pleuritic adhesion, which stretches

PLATE X The upper surface of tlie section is here shown; it is from the same body as the foregoing, and is about T4 inch thick, the saw through the inferior surface of the arch of the aorta, about one fifth of an inch below the division of the trachea, dividing the fourth dorsal vertebra just below its middle, and the sternum immediately below its articulation with the first rib, so that on the right side a small portion only of its cartilage is shown. The scapula is divided below its spine, and the humerus below the tuberosities. The section has passed just through the upper edge of the teres major, laying free the course of the posterior circumflex artery and a portion of the circumflex nerve. The nerve and artery pass directly into the deltoid muscle. The section shows clearly that both these structures must pass behind the humerus in order to attain the middle of the deltoid. The axillary vessels and nerves lie on the subscapularis and under the coraco-brachialis. Their position with regard to each other is altered from the preceding section, the artery lying more between the nerve and vein, but so enclosed in the heads of the median nerve that it appears pushed from the vein by the great nervous mass. The thorax is divided close to the lower border of the first rib, and on the right side of the sternum is a small portion of a costal cartilage, whose position corresponds with a broader section of the manubrium sterni than the preceding. Behind the sternum are the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid; laterally are the intercostal muscles, which are attached to the second, third, and fourth ribs, and which help to close in the chest wall. The section of the fourth dorsal vertebra is seen at the back of the cavity, and is divided so close to its lower surface that the articular processes of the fifth- dorsal vertebra come into the section; on the right side a small

PLATE XXYI 182 The number of sections which could be made with advantage of the hand is unlimited, as in every change of position new and interesting forms arise. This is more particularly the case with regard to the region of the thumb, where section is especially suitable for the purpose of demonstrating the peculiar relations of the joint in dislocation. It is a pity that no more space can be afforded, and I must therefore refer the reader to Pirogoffâ€™s Atlas, fasc. iv b, tab. v and vi, where frontal sections of the hand are shown, and to fasc. iv a, tab. iv and v, which represents longitudinal sections of the thumb both in its normal and dislocated conditions.

X TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE reproduce the author’s meaning in readable English, without interfering more than was absolutely necessary with the original construction of the sentences. I have taken the liberty of omitting some irrelevant matter, such as the repetition of methods of preparation, &c., which would be unnecessary and burdensome to the English student. In the text to Plates XXIX (a, b), XXX and XXXI, finding that the description of the section of the foetus referred to the author’s large work more particularly and was not in any way illustrated by the present series of plates, I omitted it. I trust that Professor Braune will not consider that I have in any way mutilated his text or impaired its utility. I cannot of course hold myself answerable for the opinions of the author in his surgical and medical comments, but have simply rendered them as I trust he intends them to be understood. I have reduced the measurements to their equivalent English notation (with the exception of the long table on page 155), on the advice of friends, although I consider that it would have been, in some respects, preferable to have retained the metric scale. I must express my warmest thanks to my friends, Mr. Edmund B. Owen, F.R.C.S., Lecturer on Anatomy in St. Mary’s Hospital, and Dr. J. Mitchell Bruce, M.A., Assistant-Physician to Charing Cross Hospital, for their kindness in revising the proof-sheets, and for many valuable hints. EDWARD BELLAMY.

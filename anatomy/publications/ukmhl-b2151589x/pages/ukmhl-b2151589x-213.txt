PLATE XX These two sections of the thigh were taken from the same individual as Plates I a and I b. The sections were so directed that the first (tab. xx, fig. 1) passed immediately below Poupart’s ligament and parallel with it, but obliquely with the direction of the thigh itself; it is consequently a section of Scarpa’s triangle, and should be compared with that given by Legendre (c Anat. Homolograph,’ PL XXIII), and by Yoltz (‘ Chirurg. Anat. der Extrem.,’ Tafl. vi, fig. 3). The second section (tab. xx, fig. 2) was not parallel with the first, but at right angles to the axis of the thigh near the perineum, so that the two sections would include a wedge taken out of the thigh, with the base external and the apex internal. The following sections ran parallel to each other, and they form a segment of about P6 inches thick. They are from a very muscular thigh, and form a series. The other sections, from below the knee to the foot, are taken from another, though equally normal, male subject, and show the same relations. The upper surfaces furnish the plates; and these, from the symmetrical structure of the extremities, will serve equally well for either limb, although they happen to be taken from the left; by being reversed they will correspond with the right, so that the under surface may be regarded as the stump of an amputation. With regard to the bones, we first notice, in tab. xx, fig. 1, the absolutely circular section of the head of the femur completely surrounded by a thin layer of cartilage, behind which is seen the cavity of the joint as a dark circle. It is enclosed by a portion of the acetabulum, which is joined by the divided part of the ischium, or rather by its upper ramus. The section

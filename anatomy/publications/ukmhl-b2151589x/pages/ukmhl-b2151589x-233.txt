PLATE XXIY Fig. 1 represents a section through the lower third of the left leg near the joint. From the decrease in the masses of the muscles and the increase of the tendinous structures the section of the limb has become considerably smaller. Although individual muscles, such as the extensor and flexor longus pollicis with the peroneus brevis, have become stronger than in the preceding plate, they do not make up for the want of those of the calf which determine the size and shape of the leg. The soleus and gastrocnemius are no longer separate, a longitudinally directed tendinous mass spreads over the posterior surface of the soleus; this is the termina- tion of the gastrocnemius, which becoming blended with the fibres of the soleus, forms the tendo Acliillis. The largest surface shown is that of the flexor longus pollicis, which is here divided at its greatest bulk. In flexing the great toe in walking this muscle contracts so forcibly that its power exceeds that of the other flexors of the toes. Its position has altered from the last plate, being further back and more beneath the tibialis posticus, so that after com- pletely crossing it in the malleolar region it lies at last most internally. The position of the deep flexors is essentially distinct from that of the extensors. The tibialis anticus lies close on the tibia, and gains the inner border of the foot without crossing its neighbours, the extensor longus pollicis and extensor communis digitorum; whilst the tibialis posticus lies in the middle on the interosseous ligament, the flexor longus pollicis on the fibula, and the flexor longus digitorum on the tibia, and these muscles cross each other before their ultimate insertion. This position is connected with their passage at the inner malleolus. As they 22 are

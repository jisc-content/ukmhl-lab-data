LCEOS JtirCSTRIOINC HEWW-»HiRUaGI€At SOCIETY AUTHOR’S PREFACE The accompanying plates, representing plane sections of the human body, are reproduced on a smaller scale from my large atlas, in which the figures are the size of nature ; and are intended to assist in extending and increasing the knowledge of the human form, and of the position of the different organs to each other. The necessity for such plates for the clinic has repeatedly been expressed, and especially for military surgery. It has been emphatically stated on all sides that the sections of the thorax and abdomen are indispensable for diagnosis, and that the examination of my plates has been of substantial assistance in judging correctly the direction of a gunshot wound. Consequently when the question arose as to preparing another edition of the large coloured atlas, it seemed advisable at the same time to arrange a smaller one, which could be made accessible to a wider circle of readers. The plates of the large atlas are faithfully reproduced by photography. Some few plates have been omitted as of subordinate interest. The text remains unaltered, with the exception of a few additions. As each plate has its special text appended, a detailed use of the atlas is rendered possible; and, as circumstances require, recapitulations are introduced for the elucidation of individual plates. In like manner the precise data relating to the structure of the individual subjects are retained and repeated in connection with the plates, in order that the observer, by examining them, may avoid mistakes on the living body.

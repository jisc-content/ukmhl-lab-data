PLATE II 36 ante-flexed uterus, so that the statement of Courty is not borne out in this case. Fig. 7 shows a retro-flexion of the uterus. The thick hypersemic uterus, which has been opened at one spot only (1), contains masses of coagulated blood, and shows retro-flexion as well as a lateral deviation. The body of Fig. 7.

Symphysis. the uterus lay more in the left half of the pelvis, and the neck, which was divided throughout its length, kept its original position. Such a condition of the uterus would cause a pressure on the rectum which would be increased to complete compression were the retro-flexion more extended. Therefore, if the retro-flexion be very considerable a stoppage of feces may be expected, but ante-flexion, as the preceding figure shows, is able to produce a similar result. The conjugate diameter was 4-4 inches.

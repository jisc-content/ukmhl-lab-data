PLATE XYII In order to bring the pelvic organs into view, a section was made of the trunk just over the symphysis pubis, and through the lower portion of the sacrum. The section passed through the inguinal region, the outer mass of the muscles of the thigh, the head of the thigh bone near its middle, the pelvis, bladder, rectum, and some coils of intestine lying in Douglas’s pouch. The ischia were divided in the tuberosity, so that the section nearly followed the sacro-spinous ligament. The plate moreover shows, enclosed in the bony pelvis, the obturator internus and levator ani muscles, aud laterally the ilio-femoral articulation with its muscles and vessels. We notice at first that the central portion is bounded by the pubis, ischium, levator ani, sacro-spinous ligament, and the last portion of the sacrum. The bladder, which contained about four ounces of frozen urine, appeared so contracted on its contents that its form was not affected by the pressure of the neighbouring organs, as is so frequently observed in Pirogoff’s pla.tes, whence the upper wall appears considerably fallen in. The body was perfectly fresh when brought in for preparation, and as no decomposition had set in gas had not formed, so that the forms of the cavities were not changed. The contents of the bladder were removed before the drawing was made. The internal orifice of the urethra is clearly seen in the middle of a fringe formed by folds of mucous mem- brane. More in front is the anterior wall of the bladder, flattened by the pressure of the symphysis. The thickness of the wall of the bladder, considering the amount of distension, is considerable. The thickness of the posterior wall, however, is due to its having been cut obliquely. In order to compare the position and form of the bladder with

PLATE XXXI 200 long, 2â€™8 inches broad, and P2 inches deep, was therefore rather less than generally met with in advanced pregnancy. . The depth of the cavity of the abdomen, measured from the symphysis to the cupola of the diaphragm, is pretty much the same as in the former case, whilst there is considerable difference in that of the thorax. I need call no particular attention in this case to the diameter of the base of the thorax, which naturally exceeds that of the female at the second month represented at Plate II. Any decided measurement as to the depth of the thorax during pregnancy can only be made on the living body, when the relations of the chest cavity before and after delivery must be determined. The relations of the heart, trachea, larynx, mouth, and brain were entirely normal. PRINTED BY J. E. ADLARD, BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE, E.C.

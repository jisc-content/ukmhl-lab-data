98 PLATE XI the apex of the heart was pushed considerably backwards; and so also was the base, although strengthened by the great vessels forming the root of the lung. There was lateral rotation of the heart on its long axis. The quantity of fluid injected in fig. 5 was five, and in fig. 6 six pounds. It was observed that after the introduction of a pound and a half of fluid, there was an evident increase of dulness on percussion in the region of the liver (corresponding with the observations of Seitz and Zamminer). As bearing on these experiments, I examined Pirogoff’s plates relating to the sections of a subject with empyema of the right side and dislocation of the heart. (The section had been made after freezing.) I also col- lected material from the same author, of a body with pneumo-thorax of the left side. After careful measurements on the different plates, the contours of the dislocated heart were constructed and shown in figs. 5 and 6 by the dotted lines, so that a comparison with the results of my own researches might be instituted. In Pirogoff’s definitions of the heart’s position, exact as they are, the quantity of the morbid fluid could not have been measured, and one cannot expect that a dislocation of the heart could be expressed by a surface of the contours. Moreover, an artificial effusion into the pleural cavity could never produce the same relations as a gradually increasing exudation. But it follows certainly from these instances, and it is even proved by the difference of methods, that in dislocations such as these, the base of the heart does not remain fixed, but that it is considerably moved from its place (and the apex likewise), and that there is a rotation of the heart on its long axis.

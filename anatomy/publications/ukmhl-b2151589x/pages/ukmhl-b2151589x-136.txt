94 PLATE XI of its upper margin. Tlie age of the man, who had lain in hospital a long time, is not clearly defined, and is as of middle life. In any case the age was greater than that of my subject. It is remark- able that, although in the region of the sternum both sections began almost exactly at the same level, they struck different vertebras; in Pirogoff’s case the fourth, in mine the sixth. As the definition of the position of the heart with regard to the bones of the anterior wall of the Fig. 1. Adult male thorax. Hydro-pericarditis. Insufficiency of aortic valves. Pleurisy.

It must be borne in mind that owing to the exudation into the peri- cardial and pleural cavities in Pirogoff’s subject, the ribs are raised and their anterior extremities lie two vertebrae higher than in my case. The following woodcut, Fig. 2, shows the variation in the position of the parts of a similar section in pleuritic effusion of the left side with pneumo-thorax. The subject is the same as in Fig. 2 of the text of

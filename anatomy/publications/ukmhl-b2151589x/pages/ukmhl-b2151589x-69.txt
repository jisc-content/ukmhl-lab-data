PLATE III 43 interfere with clearness. Moreover, the relations of this membrane are not sufficiently made out. It can be shown that this membrane is in relation with the tarsal membrane, and, with the mass of fat which lies behind it forms a sort of cup, into which the globe is pressed by the influence of the external air. Thus the eyeball moves somewhat like the head of the thigh bone in its socket, the fluid in the lymph spaces playing the part of the synovia. It is not yet shown how the capsule of Tenon is continued over the sheaths of the muscles where they pass back through it, still less so how the sheaths of cellular tissue stand in connection with it. Such a demonstration would especially be of practical importance as regards the question of the extent of the effusion of blood in the orbit.

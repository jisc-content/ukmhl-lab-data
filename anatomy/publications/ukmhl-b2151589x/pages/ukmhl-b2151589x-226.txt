PLATE XXIII Fig. 1 is a section through the upper third of the leg taken from the same subject as the last. Similar plates will be found in Yolz (a a 0, taf. ix, fig. 1) and in Pirogoff (fasc. 4, tab. yiii, fig. 8). The strong framework from which the muscles spring is formed by the tibia and fibula, the inter-osseous membrane, the strong fibular inter- muscular aponeurosis, which passes obliquely outwards and forwards from the fibula between the peroneal and extensor muscles, and the dense fascia, from which the fibres of the tibialis anticus in particular arise. The strongly developed muscles divide themselves into three groups. Anteriorly are the extensors, tibialis anticus, and extensor communis digitorum bounded behind by the interosseous membrane, the extensor longus pollicis is not yet seen, as it arises lower down. Externally and lying on the fibula is the peroneus longus, which belongs to the second group separated from the extensor communis by the intermuscular ligament. Posteriorly to both bones is the third group, in which the flexors pre- ponderate, and their deep layer is analogous to that of the extensor side in having only two muscles. The tibialis posticus lies on the interosseous ligament between the tibia and fibula, and the flexor longus digitorum, of which only a small portion is seen, on the tibia. Behind them are the large expanded surfaces of the soleus and gastrocnemius, and on the posterior aspect of the tibia is a strip of the popliteus. This muscle lies almost entirely between this and the last section (Plate XXII). The nerves belonging to the three groups are marked white. The superficial peroneal nerve lies between the peroneus longus and the fibula; and the deep peroneal nerve, which is separated from it by the fibular inter-

162 PLATE XXI The femoral artery, which begins to lie considerably more laterally with regard to the bone, is still in the same fascial sheath, between the adductor longus and vastus internus, and covered by the sartorius. The adductor longus has already lost its bulk; and the adductor brevis has disappeared at this level entirely. The profunda artery is divided at the point where it perforates the adductor magnus close to the bone. The three flexor muscles are completely isolated from each other, and lie so close together posteriorly that the great sciatic nerve takes a position in a furrow between the long head of the biceps and the semi-tendinosus. With reference to this plate, it may be added that the thigh was rotated somewhat outwards before the section was made.

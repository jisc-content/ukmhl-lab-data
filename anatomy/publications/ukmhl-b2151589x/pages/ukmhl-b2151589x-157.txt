The following woodcuts are taken from Pirogoffâ€™s atlas to demon- strate the change in the position of the apex of the heart as occasioned by pleuritic or pericardial exudation. Pig. 4 illustrates the relations of the parts, at the same level, when the pericardium is very much distended with fluid. The section is taken at Fig. 4. v n n v Male thorax. Hydro-pericarditis.

The pleurae approach each other in front, leaving only a narrow space at the left edge of the sternum. One would expect a greater separation of the pleurae from each other as the quantity of fluid in the pericardium took up greater space. It is therefore the place to choose for puncture of the peri- cardium, as has been stated before, so as not to open the pleural cavity. Pirogoff does not mention the age of the individual; it is merely noticed that the lungs (and very likely the pleurae) exhibited no abnormality.

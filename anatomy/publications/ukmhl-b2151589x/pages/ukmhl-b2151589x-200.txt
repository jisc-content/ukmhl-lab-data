PLATE XVIII 146 the synovial membrane, which was driven forwards in the form of a bladder FlG- !โข on its posterior wall. We should expect to find, in diseases of the hip-joint which exhibit similar posi- tions of the articulation, an actual lengthening of the thigh, supposing that a like quantity of fluid exists in the joint cavity. To prove this by measure- ment is impracticable. Were it possible to mea- sure it accurately to a quarter of an inch, which from the simultaneous displacement of the pel- vis can hardly be ex- pected, the flexion of the thigh, associated with this condition, renders such measurement im- practicable. The relations of the corpora cavernosa and urethra next demand at- tention. It will be seen that the section passes in front of the prostate, dividing the corpora cavernosa penis near their origins, and the urethra at the bulb. The corpus cavernosum, arteries, and muscles of the corpus cavernosum are well shown. Upon it is expanded a portion of the deep perineal muscle with a number of large veins. Frontal section of the hip-joint injected with tallow and frozen. ยง. 1. Head of femur. 2. Tendon of rectus. 3. Obturator externus. 4. Pectineus. 5. Tendon of ilio-psoas. 6. Gluteus minimus.

PLATE XIX In order to demonstrate the shape of the cavity of the knee-joint and the extent of its capsule correctly, I injected water into the articulation with a Pravazâ€™s needle under great pressure, and, having slightly flexed the joint, froze it. The limb was taken from a normal body (young female). The section passed tolerably nearly through the middle, and divided the extremity into two nearly equal halves, of which the right one was used for the plate, after the removal of the frozen water. All the joints, not the hip and shoulder only, are subject to atmo- spheric pressure ; and, on account of the small quantity of synovia which they contain, can retain their normal position and not show free cavities, as one finds on opening a joint in a soft preparation. Accordingly the synovial cavity appears in the section of a normal joint as a narrow crevice, which in the following section of a normal uninjected knee-joint is represented by a single black line. If this joint be compared with the injected specimen, as represented in Plate XIX, one can understand the meaning of the black line which indicates the joint cavity. Further, the position of the patella is seen in normal and abnormal joints. Whilst in the normal condition of the joint the patella touches the femur with a small portion of its cartilaginous surface like a tangent, in the case of the distended synovial membrane it is completely lifted off it. The patella floats, supported by the fluid as a board on water, and must therefore yield under pressure of the finger until it reaches the femur, which lies behind it. The capacity of the joint-cavity is well shown, whilst in the woodcut the synovial membrane of the extensor muscles appears as separated from it, since the wide aperture of communication which unites it with the bulging out of the capsule is not opened by the section ; and on the injected

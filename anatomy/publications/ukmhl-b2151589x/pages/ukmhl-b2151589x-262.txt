PLATES XXIX (A, B) AND XXX The body from which this preparation was made was quite recent, twenty-five years of age, in the last month of pregnancy, and received in the condition of rigor mortis. Beyond the constriction of the neck produced by the means of death (hanging) no abnormality existed. The condition of the genitals corresponded with an advanced stage of preg- nancy, and were injected and succulent. The method of preparation was carried out in the usual manner. The foetus, which was divided in the section of the body, was subsequently restored to its original condition, so as to afford a representation of its former position in the uterus. I chiselled out the foetus and the liquor amnii from the left side of the body, and moistened the surface of the section of the uterus, and then froze it on the right side. The portion now lying in the right half of the uterus remained then for the purposes of representation as an untouched foetus. The left half of the uterus and its appendages, after the removal of the rest of the liquor amnii, was represented as empty. The foetus, which was in the second position of the head, was a well-formed female. The vulva were closed and the nails well developed. Its entire length was about twenty-three inches, its weight without the cord about six pounds. The cord was divided, and passed to the placenta between the head and right arm, the placenta being placed downwards and on the right side of the uterus. The child, as the plate shows, lay mostly in the right half of the uterus. In the section more than the right half of the head which was sawn obliquely, was removed. Moreover, the left arm and a portion of the right shoulder were divided longitudinally, and the forearm being placed at right angles with it, transversely, as well as a portion of the right leg, which extended towards

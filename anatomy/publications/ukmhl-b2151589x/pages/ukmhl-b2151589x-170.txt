PLATE XY In tliis plate tlie 1st lumbar vertebra is divided in the middle; on the right side are the sections of the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, seventh and eighth ribs, the seventh and eighth being twice cut; and anteriorly the arches of the cartilages appear. On the left side the twelfth rib is absent, as from being so short it is not met with in the section, but lies entirely in the preceding lamina. This section, like the preceding, exposes the upper portion of the abdomen, with a part of the spleen, stomach, and a large part of the liver. The diaphragm is divided anteriorly through its attachment opposite the seventh rib, near the transversalis muscle; afterwards in its free portion, so that a portion of the pleural cavity is seen; and posteriorly through its arch and crura. The pleural cavity, which is clearly evident at the posterior wall of the trunk, reaches further downwards there than it does in front; and extends on the left side to the section of the ninth, and on the right side to the seventh rib. It appears as a fine chink, which in pleurisy widens out into a considerable cavity, and may hold a large quantity of fluid (about one pound) before its presence can be demonstrated. A normal lung, however, may fill up this space in deep inspiration. Besides the rest of the liver, stomach and spleen, in the space included by the diaphragm and the transversalis muscle, are seen the kidneys, pancreas and intestines. The section, of which the upper surface is here represented, is three and a half inches below the preceding, its inferior surface reaching to the navel. In order to make the cavities of the intestines clear, their frozen con- tents were with great care broken loose before their walls were thawed by means of warm pincers; and then the cavities accurately drawn with their folds in the hardened condition. Thus the regular sharply pro-

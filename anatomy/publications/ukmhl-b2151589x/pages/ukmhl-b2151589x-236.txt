PLATE XXY v! DING The accompanying frontal section of the tliorax and shoulder-joints was made from the body of a very powerful man. Beyond the enlarged thyroid body there was nothing abnormal. From the recumbent position of the body, particular regard was taken of the upper extremity, and it appeared desirable to divide the humeri in their long axes, and the arms being- placed in the position they would have held in the upright position were rolled outwards so that the bicipital groove was directed forwards. After being frozen in this position, the head was removed from the neck just below the larynx, and the rest of the body separated by a section through the nipples. The frontal section was so directed that it passed through the middle of the heads of the humeri and their shafts. Before freezing, the arteries were injected from the femoral. The cupolae of the lungs are divided through their highest points. Both subclavian arteries pass over the cupolae of the lungs, and consequently cause an impression on the pleura, which on examining the cavity of the chest can be readily recognised. The arteries, however, do not cross the cupolge of the lungs at their highest points. They lie considerably behind them and below the brachial plexus in the neighbourhood of the head of the first rib. The section has passed through the arch of the right subclavian artery, but not disturbed the left, running in front of it as is clearly seen in the plate. The preparation showed on further examination that the lungs and pleural cavities extended considerably further up. The first ribs were divided at their anterior extremities, the right behind the origin of the scalenus anticus the left immediately through its origin. The roots of the lungs lie behind the section, the left further from its plane than the right. *

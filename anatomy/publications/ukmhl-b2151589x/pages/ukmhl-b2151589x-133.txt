PLATE XI This plate represents the upper surface of a lamina about an inch and a half thick, which was cut by a section passing through the trunk imme- diately beneath the sternal end of the second rib and the upper border of the sixth dorsal vertebra ; the saw passed out through the fat of the axilla, dividing the humerus at the insertion of the teres major. Attached to the bone are the tendinous insertions of the great pectoral muscles, and on account of the position of the arms as regards the trunk they are so disposed as to exhibit a flat upward curve, and have been twice cut. Under the tendon of the pectoralis major lie the biceps and coraco-brachialis, and close under the last-named muscle are the vessels and nerves. The axillary artery is surrounded by the plexus, and is found next the muscle. The fascia of the coraco-brachialis must be divided to ligature this artery (after the arm has been raised), and the vessel should be reached from the sheath of the muscle, which can be easily drawn outwards; thus there will be little risk of pinching up and wounding the nerves and veins. Those portions of the trunk which are divided in the second intercostal space are of very great importance. The section of the great vessels passes immediately over their valves, and the left auricle with the upper wall of the auricular appendix are shown. The left auricular appendix lies more deeply, and is seen in front of the ascending aorta. Immediately behind the sternum the lungs and pleuras approximate each other so closely, that only a very small interspace remains. This narrow space leads from the anterior mediastinum to the region of the thymus gland; a sagittal section in the mesial plane in this body must have opened the right pleural cavity.

89 PLATE X so adherent to the thickened pleura, that the pleural cavity was divided into two portions, each holding a considerable quantity of blood and pus. Fig. 4. Subject E.â€”Male thorax. Lateral empyema of left side. Accumulation of serum in right pleural cavity. Pirogoff, ii, 18, 1, A 1. Trachea. 2. (Esophagus. 3. Superior cava. 4. Arch of aorta. The left lung was adherent to the wall of the chest, and in consequence of the pressure from the pleuritic effusion the pericardium had become irregular in shape. The left side of the heart was much hypertrophied, and the mitral valve was covered with vegetations. The section which was made at the same level as mine, namely, through the middle of the first intercostal space, passed through the second, third and fourth ribs and divided the fourth dorsal vertebra in its lower half; great deviation of the mediastinum is shown. On account of the collection of fluid in the left pleural cavity the trachea is pushed over towards the right side, and the oesophagus lies the breadth of half a vertebra from its usual position towards the right side, so that deglutition must have been considerably interfered with. The plate also shows a dislocation of the superior vena cava almost to the middle of the right half of the thorax. In consequence 12

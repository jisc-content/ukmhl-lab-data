Pirogoff represents both portions of the section, as the saw had removed so much that there was considerable difference in the two sides. Pirogoff in his text, fasc. ii, p. 10, states that after freezing the body the upper extremities were removed with the scapuke. The pulmonary and costal pleurae were closely adherent. The cavities, which are shown by the deeper shading, have attained an enormous size, and the left side of the thorax was consider- ably more sunken in than the right; on the woodcut, however, it does not appear very remarkable.

But the transverse diameter of the left portion of the thoracic cavity is considerably larger than the right.

PLATE IX This plate represents a section between the regions of the neck and thorax of a man twenty-two years of age, powerfully built and perfectly normal. All the sections, as far as to that of the pelvis, in the following series have been made from this subject. The lamina in this plate was about 1â€™4 inch thick, and its upper surface is shown, so that the body is viewed from above. The arteries were injected. The section passed just below the upper border of the manu- brium sterni, and through the upper margin of the third dorsal vertebra, together with a small portion of its underlying cartilage. Close to the sternum lie the clavicles in section and their interarticular fibro-cartilages. Laterally, near the sternal ends of the clavicles, are the sections of the first ribs, behind them those of the second, and further backwards and inwards those of the third. These last are not quite symmetrically divided, in consequence of the somewhat higher level of the right side of the chest. On the left side the third rib exhibits in con- nection with it a portion of the transverse process of the vertebra which articulates with it; whilst on the right side merely a small portion of the head of the rib is shown. The scapulge are divided through the glenoid cavities. The heads of the humeri show the greater tuberosities and the lower portion of their articular surfaces. If the plate which in the large coloured atlas is figured IX be compared with this (the position of the parts in the man of fifty years with that of a man of twenty-two years), it will be seen that in the former

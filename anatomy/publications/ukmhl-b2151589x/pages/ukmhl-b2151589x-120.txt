The apex of the left lung was so compressed by the mixture of pus and air that it is not visible in this section ; on the right side the lung was divided near its cupola. It is evident that the distension of the left side of the thorax is not due to the elevation of the ribs only, but also to the dragging inwards of the mediastinum; and in consequence of this the structures in the upper portion of this thoracic cavity appear to be pushed considerably out of their places.

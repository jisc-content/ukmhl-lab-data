PLATE YI This plate is taken from a section of tlie same body as the last, and has been prepared in the usual manner. The section passed through the larynx, and should properly have kept to the plane of the lower vocal cords, but it passed above them in a horizontal direction, and fell on the lower half of the sixth cervical vertebra. The body has a peculiarly well-arched thorax, and owing to the great muscular development, the shoulders are high up, and although there are the normal number of vertebrae the neck appears short, corresponding in the most marked degree with the male type of neck formation. Here again the section does not show a circular contour, but rather a pris- matic one. It is easily seen that this is owing, to a great extent, to the powerful muscular development of the sterno-cleido-mastoids and the trapezii. As the section has not passed through the head of the humerus, but through the acromio-clavicular articulation, it did not traverse the shoulders at their greatest breadth, but at the junction of the regions of the neck and shoulder. Therefore the lateral portions of the plate represent only the upper portion of the roundness of the shoulder, the supplementary parts of which will be shown in following plates. The slight irregularity noticed in the edges is owing to loss of substance after the use of the saw. In the female, or slightly developed male subject, the lamina, which in this case was about *4 in. thick, would have taken a totally different form, as the position of the shoulder would be lower in the so-called cylindrical

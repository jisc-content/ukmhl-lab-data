108 PLATE XIII outwards, and lies for the most part covered by it. The portion of the diaphragm that supports the pericardium indicates the position of the heart. If the left ventricle, when full, exceeds the margin on the left side, it is clear that the heart lies, not on the stomach, but on the liver, and only its apex reaches the region of the stomach, and a transverse section would be similar to that represented on Plate XIII. The left cupola of the diaphragm is distended, therefore, by the left lobe of the liver, stomach, and spleeu. Fig. 1. r . if 1. (Esophagus. 2. Aorta. 3. Inferior vena cava. 4. Liver. 5.

By simple inspection of the form of the circumference of the liver, it is evident that the figure was taken from another body, and that a body was used in which there was consider- able distension of the stomach. This distension was not obtained by mere experiment, which very easily disturbs the relations of the parts : the subject was perfectly fresh, and the examination was made before it was touched in any way. The stomach, which was distended with food, did not extend as far as the left side, but still had against it the fatty portion of the peritoneum, which drags on the left end of the transverse colon, and which is continuous with the greater sac.

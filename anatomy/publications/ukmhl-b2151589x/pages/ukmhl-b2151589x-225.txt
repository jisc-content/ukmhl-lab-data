165 PLATE XXII of the patella they keep the fragments in position; and, if the fracture of the bone be transverse, they are torn simultaneously with it. If the patella be sawn through, on the body, maintaining, however, these lateral ligamentous structures, and the leg be flexed, the halves of the patella separate slightly from each other; if, however, they be divided in addition, there immediately ensues a very wide separation of the fragments. We can thus understand why stellate fractures of the patella unite by bone, as in this instance the patella alone is involved; whereas in transverse fracture the ligaments are also torn, the extensor muscles dislocating the upper fragment. The plate shows broad ligamentous bands passing from the patella to both sides of the femur, and surrounding the entire knee-joint anteriorly and laterally. Behind the articular surfaces of the condyles is the expansion of the synovial cavity between the crucial ligaments. The nerve, artery, and vein, lie close behind each other, the former being more external; the sciatic nerve dividing into the external popliteal inside and below the biceps, and the internal popliteal more towards the middle. The muscles, which in fig. 1 showed such fleshy masses, are here confined and diminished in bulk. They are for the most part completely reduced to tendon ; and the defined form of contour, which is characteristic of the region of the knee-joint, is dependent on that of the bones. In synovitis, the patella would be lifted off the articular surface of the thigh bone, the distension of the capsule being especially evident in front. The posterior parts are but slightly yielding, and are consequently only slightly separated from the posterior surfaces of the condyles.

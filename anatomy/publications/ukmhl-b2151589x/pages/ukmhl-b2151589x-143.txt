PLATE XII This section, like the one just described, is viewed from above down- wards, the thickness of the lamina being about one inch and a half. The section passed through both nipples and the third intercostal spaces, dividing the auricles of the heart and their valves. It passes back- wards to the upper border of the eighth dorsal vertebra, and shows the eighth ribs of both sides; it cuts also the inferior angle of the shoulder-blade. The great value of the plate consists in the fortunate section through the heart, both auricle and ventricle being opened. The left auriculo- ventricular opening is divided nearly in half, and the right is so cut at its upper border that a view is obtained of the ventricle. At first sight the cut surface of the heart and the space which this organ occupies seem immensely large, -and yet a subsequent examination shows their rela- tions to be normal. From the oblique position of the heart in the thorax a transverse section of the body would not divide it transversely but obliquely; therefore its walls appear much thicker than they really are. The left auricle is divided not far from its base. The portion of it here represented shows a cavity about '3 of an inch in its deepest part, while towards the right side the section rises to the level of the pulmonary veins. A small portion of the aortic segment of the mitral valve has been taken away; it will be found on the right side of the mitral opening. Behind the left auricle the great cardiac vein is seen passing to the right auricle to open by the coronary sinus below the remains of the Eustachian valve. The point of opening lies too deeply to be clearly shown in the plate.

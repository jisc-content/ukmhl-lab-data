PLATE XXYII The series of transverse sections from which the present and following plates were taken was made from the left arm of a man set. 40. The arteries were injected. The forearm was slightly flexed and pronated. In order to obtain bearing points for the individual laminae, a line was pre- viously drawn passing through the middle of the biceps over the surface of the supinator longus to the thumb, and the uppermost points of each subsequent lamina lie in this line. Fig. 1. In this instance the line of section passes through the middle of the arm, and its surface is seen from above downwards, hence we may imagine that we have the stump of an amputation of the right arm for examination, as has been before suggested in speaking of the lower extremity. The section is taken below the insertion of the deltoid, the biceps and triceps occupying the greater space. On the anterior aspect of the bone are portions of the brachialis anticus and coraco-brachialis; in the middle, to the right of the observer, and between the flexor and extensor muscles, are the great vessels and nerves, and the musculo-spiral nerve has already commenced its tor- tuous course accompanied by the superior profunda artery. This position of the nerve accounts for the fact that blows or injuries from behind are capable of compressing it so directly upon the humerus that paralysis may be the result. The separation of the muscular masses of the flexors and extensors is already at this level so decided, that the intermuscular aponeu- rosis appears in the frontal plane. The relation of the individual muscles is so clear as hardly to demand any particular explanation. Fig. 2 is a section of the left arm in the middle of its lower third. The flexor and extensor muscles lie on both sides of the humerus, and the intermuscular aponeuroses are here still more clearly seen than in the preceding section. In the external intermuscular septum is the musculo-

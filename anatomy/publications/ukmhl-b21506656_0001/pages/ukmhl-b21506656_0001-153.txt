THE PTERYGOID REGION 133 little mylo-hyoid branch. In addition to these the tympanic and small meningeal branches are sometimes seen. They may be sought close to or rising in common "with the middle meningeal. Later on, when the external ptery- goid muscle has been reflected, it may be possible to trace the tympanic artery to the Glaserian fissure and the small meningeal to the foramen ovale. Fig. G3.—Temporo-maxillary Articulation, from outer side. E.L.L. External Lateral Ligament. S.M.L. Stylo-mandibular Ligament. S.H.L. Stylo-hyoid Ligament. Just in front of the inferior dental nerve, and, like it, becoming visible at the lower border of the external ptery- goid muscle, is the lingual nerve. In order to see more of these structures the external pterygoid must be turned forward with the condyle of the jaw, and in doing this the articulation should be studied as I thoroughly as possible. _ Temporo-maxillary Joint [articulatio mandibularis]— I Clean the capsule as much as possible, and define the

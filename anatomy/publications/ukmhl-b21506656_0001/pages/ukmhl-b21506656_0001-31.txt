THE SPINAL REGION H' skin, they are necessarily entirely cutaneous. A good woit ino- generalisation is that the outer two columns of the erector spina, are supplied by the external branches while the spinalis dorsi and multifidus spina, are supplied by the '""^ The outer column of the erector spinse has been followed up into the neck as the cervicalis ascendens. The outer series of insertions of the longissimus dorsi is not continued into the neck at all, but the inner series is prolonged by three muscles, the trachelo-mastoid, transversahs colli, and complexus. All of these rise from the transverse processes of the upper thoracic and, higher up, from the articular processes of the lower cervical vertebrae. In addition to these the complexus very often has a few slips of origm from the lower cervical spines (see Fig. 3). The Trachelo-mastoid [M. longissimus capitis] runs up from this origin to the outer side of the mastoid process, and is easily recognised as the only muscle between the splenius and the complexus. It is sometimes called the transversalis capitis. The Transversalis Colli [M. longissimus cervicis] is in- separably blended with the last muscle at its origin, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of most of the cervical transverse processes. The Complexus [M. semispinalis capitis] runs up to the space between the superior and inferior curved lines on the occipital bone. Its inner part forms a fairly distinct muscle with a fleshy belly above and below and a central tendon; this is known as the biventer cervicis. At the insertion of the outer border of the complexus look for the occipital artery, which passes superficial to the muscle. Close to this point the artery gives off the arteria princeps cervicis [ramus descendens], a branch which divides into smaller superficial and deep branches running down on the corresponding surfaces of the complexus. The cervicalis ascendens, transversalis colli, and trachelo-

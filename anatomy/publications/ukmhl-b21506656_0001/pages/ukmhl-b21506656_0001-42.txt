22 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the root iust before the ganglion is reached. SHt one open to verify this. When looked at from outside the dura mater the sleeves on the anterior and posterior I'oots look like one sleeve, because they are connected by fibrous tissue • The Arachnoid [arachnoidea spinalis] is a very delicate transparent membrane lying quite close to the dura mater and often thickened in old subjects by delicate calcified plates. It absolutely cuts off the subdural space from the subarachnoid [cavum subarachnoidalej which lies inside it and contains the cerebro-spinal fluid (see Fig. 8). Pick up the arachnoid and open it as the dura mater was opened on y keep a little to one side of the mid line. Smce the arachnoid nes'so close to the dura mater, it is obvious tbat the lower hmit of the subarachnoid space will be at practically the ame level as that of the subdural already determined. N^ice that, on reflecting the arachnoid, its subarachnoid fpace contains delicate trabecule which become ma^ed int a definite septum in the mid hue behmd. This is he seX^n postiLm, and a knowledge of its presence prompted the advice that the arachnoid should be divided a httle to nnp side of the middle line. . e The P« Spinalis is rather thicker than that o the brain, and closely invests the cord.

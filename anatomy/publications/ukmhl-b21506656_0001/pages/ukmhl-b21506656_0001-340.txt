320 PRACTICAL ANATOMY artery divides into four branches, the two superior cerebellar and the two posterior cerebral arteries. The superior cerebellar artery of each side runs outwards and backwards round the crus cerebri, just below the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli and the fourth nerve. When the upper surface of the cerebellum is reached it divides, like the posterior inferior cerebellar, into internal or vermian, and external or hemispheric branches. The posterior cerebral artery runs parallel with and just in front of the superior cerebellar to the internal (medial) surfaces of the temporal and occipital lobes of the cerebrum, but separated from the latter artery by the third and fourth nerves. Each posterior cerebral artery at first has a slight forward convexity, at the most anterior point of which the posterior communicating artery joins it to the internal carotid, to com- plete the circle of Willis. These posterior communicating trunks often differ in size on the two sides, and sometimes are absent altogether. At the very beginning of the posterior cerebral artery look for the postero-median ganglionic branches going through the posterior perforated space, and farther on for some poster0-lateral ganglionic branches to the corpora geni- culata and corpora quadrigemina. When the main trunk has reached the under surface of the splenium by curving round the crus cerebri, it gives off the posterior choroidal artery through the great transverse fissure to the choroid plexus of the body of the lateral, as well as to that of the third ventricle. From its outer side, as it passes back, the posterior cerebral gives off temporal branches to the medial surface of the temporal lobe, and finally ends in occipital twigs, which, of course, must not be confused with the occipital artery outside the skull (see Fig. 142). Now take a last general survey of the blood supply of the brain, and notice that the outer (lateral) side of the cerebrum

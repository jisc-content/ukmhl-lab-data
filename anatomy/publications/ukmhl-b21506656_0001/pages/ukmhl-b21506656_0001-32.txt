PRACTICAL ANATOMY 12 mastoid muscles should now be cut, and their nerves from the posterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves found. The Levator Anguli ScapulcB [M. levator scapuhe] has been defined in its lower part by the dissectors of the upper extremity. Do not displace it more than is really necessary, as it forms a large part of the floor of the posterior triangle. It usually rises from the posterior tubercles of the upper three cervical transverse processes. The levator anguli scapulas should be gently drawn aside in order to examine the attachments of the scalenus medius and posticus [MM. scaleni medius et posterior]. These muscles are very closely blended at their upper attachments, but below they may be separated easily enough, since the posticus is attached to the second rib behind the attachment of the serratus magnus. Cut it through near its lower attachment, and then the upper part may be traced to the posterior tubercles of the cervical transverse processes, usually the lower three. The scalenus medius is attached below to the first rib just behind the groove in which the subclavian artery and lower trunk of the brachial plexus lie. Above, it is attached to the posterior tubercles of most of the cervical transverse processes; most commonly to all except the first and last. Some fibres of the scalenus medius end in the fibrous backing {Sibsons fascia) which strengthens the dome of the pleura. When these are very distinct they are sometimes called the scalenus pleuralis. The terms "origin and insertion" have been purposely avoided in describing these scalene muscles since they pro- bably act equally well in either direction. The middle and posterior scalenes are innervated from the anterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves, third to the seventh, but it is better to leave the search for these until later. The six muscles which are attached to the posterior

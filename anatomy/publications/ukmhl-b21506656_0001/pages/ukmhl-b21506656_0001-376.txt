356 PRACTICAL ANATOMY its upper portion is, from tlie posterior aspect, much thicker than the lower portion, a condition to some extent attribut- able to the fact that with the upper portion is blended the so-called reflected head of the rectus femoris muscle, the head passing forwards from its origin immediately above the acetabulum to join at a right angle the straight head which descends from the anterior inferior iliac spine. The lower portion of the capsule posteriorly should be closely observed, for, with the exception of a small portion anteriorly where the capsule is not infrequently absent, allowing the synovial membrane to protrude as a bursa under the ilio-psoas, it is the weakest portion of the capsule, and is the part which is almost invariably rent by the head of the femur in dislocation of the hip. Further, it is on the posterior aspect of the capsule that the circular fibres, the so-called zomdar band, are most evident. Attached to the body of the ischium just below and behind the aceta- bulum, they pass forward as a distinct band to be finally lost among the other fibres of the capsule. If_ the nerve to the quadratus femoris be again examined, it may be now possible to trace a branch from it to the capsule of the joint. â€¢ -n u In exposing the joint the tensor fascvx, femoQ^is will be seen. It rises from the anterior two inches of the iliac crest, and is inserted into the iUo-tibial band. Before leaving the gluteal region it will be well to take special notice of three points concerning which mistakes are often made in the examination room. The first is that the origin of the semi-membranosus must be sought deep to that of the other two hamstrings. The second is that the shiny aponeurosis on the outer side of the thigh, exposed when the gluteus maximus is reflected, is the origin of the vastus externus and not the ilio-tibial band. . The third point is that the adductor magnus appears m the gluteal region on both sides of the hamstrings.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 36 round the middle of this border and runs forward deep to the external jugular vein. The great auricular nerve [N. auricularis magnus] runs upwards and forwards from the same place, and is usually found parallel to and a little above the external jugular vein. The small occipital nerve [N. occipitalis minor] runs upwards and a Uttle backwards also from about the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, its course being parallel to this border. Cutaneous twigs from any or all of these nerves should be looked for, supplying the skin of the posterior triangle. Lower down, nearer the attachment of the sterno-mastoid, a descending nerve will be found running to the skin super- ficial to the manubrium sterni; this is the suprasternal descending branch of the cervical plexus [N. supraclavicu- laris anterior]. The supraclavicular [N. supraclavicularis medius] de- scending branch is more external and divides into many twigs which cross the clavicle, while more externally still are the supra-acromial branches [N. supraclavicularis pos- terior] passing to the skin of the shoulder. Follow up the external jugular vein as far as the limits of the dissection allow, and in cleaning it look for some small lymphatic nodes or glands, as they are often called, lying close to it. These are the superficial cervical nodes [Lymphoglandulae cervicales superficiales]. Now define the anterior edge of the trapezius all the way up, and clean away the fat and cellular tissue near each structure as it is found. The spinal accessory (11th cranial) nerve [N. accessorius] is the most important structure in the upper part of the triangle, and is sometimes accidentally cut in operations for the removal of deep lymphatic nodes. The surface marking of the nerve is from midway

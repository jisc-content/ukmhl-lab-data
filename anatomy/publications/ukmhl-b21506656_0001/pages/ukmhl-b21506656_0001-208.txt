188 PRACTICAL ANATOMY downwards through the inner part of the socket of the central incisor tooth, which should be drawn before the section is made. As soon as the saw is approaching the soft palate the latter should be divided with a knife as near the mid line as possible. Now the side wall and roof of the pharynx may be thoroughly explored. The most striking structure is the inner opening of the Eustachian tube [ostium pharyngeum tubse], a large and somewhat triangular orifice, situated about half an inch below the roof of the pharynx, half an inch above the soft palate, half an inch behind the posterior end of the inferior tur- binated bone, and half an inch in front of the posterior wall of the pharynx. Just behind the opening the cartilage formmg the inner wall of the tube projects and forms an elevation in the mucous membrane, known as the Eustachian cushion [torus tubarius]. The dissector should pass a blowpipe, with the end slightly bent, through the nose, and notice how easily the Eustachian tube can be catheterised. A little behind and above the opening of the tube is the lateral recess of the pharynx [recessus pharyngeus]. In the roof of the pharynx a small recess, the pharyngeal bv/rsa, should be looked for, though it is not always seen in dissecting-room subjects. It is easily demonstrable, however, in the foetus or child. Surrounding this bursa is a mass of lymphoid tissue known as the pharyngeal tonsil, which also extends some way down the posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls. Like the pharyngeal bursa, it is seen at its best in the child, and when chronically enlarged causes the condition known as " adenoids," from which so many children suffer. Now look carefully at the section of the Soft Palate [velum palatinum], and noticethat it is covered by mucous membrane on both surfaces, which enclose between them muscular and glandular tissue. Anteriorly the glandular tissue predomi- nates, but posteriorly the muscular is more plentiful.

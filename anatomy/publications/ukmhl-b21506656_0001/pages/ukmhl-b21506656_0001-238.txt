218 PRACTICAL ANATOMY its centre is the place where the retinal artery breaks up into radiating branches for the innermost layers of the retina. The disc is of great clinical importance, and is examined with the ophthalmoscope in the living body. Its surface is slightly raised, and, as it only consists of nerve fibres, it is spoken of by physiologists as the " blvnd spot" At the posterior pole of the eye, and therefore 3 mm. to the outer (temporal) side of the disc, is the nnacula lutea or yellow spotâ€”oyal, with its long axis (2 to 3 mm.) hori- zontal. It is the seat of most acute vision. Cut one of the fresh bullocks' eyes through trans- versely and, after removing the vitreous, look for the optic disc- try to notice particularly the arrangement of the arteries and veins in it. There is no yellow spot in the ox, since this only occurs in animals which use their eyes tor binocular vision. On the other hand, a beautiful iridescent colouring, not found in man, is present in the retma of the ox and is known as the tapetum. ' In the anterior half of the eye remove the vitreous humour and trace the retina forwards. A little behind the region of the cihary bodies its nervous elements end m a scalloped edge called the ora serrata, though a pigmented and epithelial layer is continued forwards as the pars cilians and pars iridica retince. . Everything seen in this half of the bullocks eye should be checked in the corresponding half of the human eye, as far as its condition will allow. _ In removing the lens, look at its posterior surface tor a mark like an upright Y. This shows the place where the various lamellae of which it is composed are joined together. When the lens is removed, look at its anterior surface, which bears a similar mark, only the Y is now inverted. Of course, these marks are only apparent when the transparency ot the structures has disappeared. 1 This should be done with scissors, unless it is frozen, and cut with the saw like the others.

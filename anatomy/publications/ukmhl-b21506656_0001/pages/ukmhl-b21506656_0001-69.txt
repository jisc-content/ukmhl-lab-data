49 THE SCALP the roots of the hairs can be seen, the aponeurosis is safe. Reflecting the skin of the scalp is tedious work, because the connective tissue is so dense and binds the skin down to the subjacent aponeurosis, thus separating the fat into little pellets. As soon as the skin is reflected, look out for the cutaneous nerves. The Supraorbital Nerve [N. supraorbitalis] should be found as it comes out of its notch in the supraorbital margin. To reach it here the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle surrounding the orbit must be cut through. The nerve divides into an external and an internal branch, some- times before, sometimes after, leaving the notch, and both of these must be looked for. They both pierce either the frontalis muscle or its aponeurosis, usually the former, though the internal branch does so first. With care the external branch may be dissected back beyond a vertical line drawn upwards from the external auditory meatus, the internal not quite so far. The Supratrochlear Nerve [N. supratrochlearis] should next be found, as it rounds the supraorbital margin a quarter of an inch internal to the supraorbital nerve. It soon pierces the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and may be followed up on to the forehead for two inches or so. Both the foregoing are branches of the first division of the trigeminal or fifth cranial nerve. The temporal branch of the temporo-malar nerve [N. zygomatico-temporalis] is found piercing the temporal fascia, about an inch behind the external angular process. The easiest way to find this small and somewhat elusive nerve is to pass the finger-nail along the posterior border of the malar bone until the tubercle is felt; the nerve lies just above this. It is the only branch of the second division of the fifth nerve on the scalp, and supplies the skin super- ficial to the front of the temporal region.

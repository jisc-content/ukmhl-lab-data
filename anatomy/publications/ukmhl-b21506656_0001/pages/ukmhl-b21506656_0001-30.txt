In the upper three lumbar nerves the external branches continue to supply the skin as they do in the lower thoracic region, but these branches pierce the ilio-costahs and appear Fig. 5.—Diagram of the Posterior Primary Division of the Eighth Thoracic Nerve. 4.

In the lower lumbar nerves there are very few cutaneous fibres, but where they do supply skin it is by means of the internal branches. The course of the sacral and coccygeal nerves will be examined by the dissectors of the lower extremity. It must not be thought that, because either the external or internal branches of the posterior primary divisions supply

On Learning the Structure of the Body.â€”In the succeed- ing pages the authors have tried continually to bear in mind that they are writing a guide for future medical practitioners, and that it is a practical guide for the dissecting-room. It therefore contains, as far as is possible, only statements which may be verified or disproved by the student with the means at hand in the anatomical department. Microscopical Ana- tomy has been left for the Histological Laboratory, while many things of great medical importance, such as the nerve paths of the spinal cord and brain, which have been dis- covered by physiological, embryological, and pathological methods, cannot be demonstrated in the dissecting-room. These must be learnt from the systematic treatises on Anatomy. Hardly any of the body is now beyond the reach of the surgeon's knife, and the modern surgeon may find himself

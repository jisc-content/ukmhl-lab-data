156 PRACTICAL ANATOMY As soon as the sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid is divided, the muscle, with the inner end of the clavicle attached, may be carefully reflected up to its insertion, but can be replaced whenever it is necessary to verify relations. Just as a study of the more superficial relations^ of the common carotid artery and its branches brings the dissector into touch with the structures in the anterior triangle, so a study of their deeper relations forms a useful method of approaching the deeper parts of the neck. POSTEKIOK OR DeEP RELATIONS OF THE COMMON CaEOTID Artery in the Neck Banes. The transverse processes of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae. Muscles.—The prevertebral muscles attached to these transverse processes, namely, the longus colli, rectus capitis anticus major, and scalenus anticus. Fibrous Structures.—Cellnlar tissue forming the posterior part of the carotid sheath. Arteries.—The inferior thyroid and its ascending cervical branch. Veins.—None. . Serves.—Y&gns with cardiac branches. Sympathetic with cardiac branches, Recurrent Laryngeal on right side. The anterior tubercles of the transverse processes should be localised at once; the 4th and 5th often lie a little internal to, as well as behind, the artery, the former bemg at the level of the bifurcation. The 6th is said to be the largest, and is often known as the carotid tubercle, since agamst it the common carotid may be effectively compressed. Of the muscles the longus colli lies m front of the bodies of the vertebrae, and the rectus capitis anticus major runs up in front of the transverse processes. They will both be seen much better later on.

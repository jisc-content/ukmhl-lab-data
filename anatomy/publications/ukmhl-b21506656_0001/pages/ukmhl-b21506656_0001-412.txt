PRACTICAL ANATOMY 392 fibrous bands, the retinacula. These bands contain blood vessels, and play an important part in conveying blood to the intra-capsular portion of the femur. If the cut surface of the ligamentum teres be examined, a small branch of the in- ternal circumflex or obturator artery will be noticed, an im- portant source of vascular supply to the head of the femur.

Now turn to the acetabular half of the capsule. The aceta- bulum is clearly divisible into cartilaginous and non-cartila ginous regions; the former is horse-shoe shaped and encloses the latter, which is occupied by a pad of fat. Immediately around this pad the ligamentum teres, which here is flattened and spread out, acquires an attachment to the crescentic margin separating the articular from the non-articular area of the acetabulum. The depth of the acetabulum is consider-

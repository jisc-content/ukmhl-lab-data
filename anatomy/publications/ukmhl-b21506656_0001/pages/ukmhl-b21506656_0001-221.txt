THE ORBIT 201 small infratrochlear branch is given oif which joins a twig of the same name from the nasal nerve. The Lacrimal nerve is smaller than the frontal, and runs forwards through the anterior lacerated foramen, along the outer part of the roof Fig. 96.â€”The Left Orbit from above. L.P.S.

Lacrimal Gland drawn aside. of the orbit, until it reaches the lacrimal gland, which it enters and supplies. After this a few twigs come out of the front of the gland to supply the outer part of the upper eyelid with sensation. In the outer part of the orbit a small twio' of communication is received from the temporo-malar nerve.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 258 tympanum through a foramen on the wall between the jugular fossa and carotid canal. Of course this plexus is embedded in the mucous membrane covering the promon- tory, but its larger branches may sometimes be seen without interfering with this in any way. This is the more easy during life, as a small vessel accompanies the nerve. Stap M.A. Staped S.P.F. J.V. F-R- Fig. 117.—Inner Wall of the Left Tympanum. PC Processus Cochlearitormis. T.T.

The most important branch of the plexus is the small superficial petrosal nerve, which leaves the tympanum jus- above the promontory and reappears in the middle cerebr fossa, where it has already been looked for on its way to th otic ganglion (see p. 81). Above the posterior part of the promontory is the fenest ovalis [f. vestibuli], a small kidney-shaped aperture, situat

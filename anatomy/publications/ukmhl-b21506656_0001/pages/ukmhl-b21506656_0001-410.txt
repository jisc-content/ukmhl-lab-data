PRACTICAL ANATOMY 390 the femur below and in front, and to an inch internal to the inter-trochanteric line below and behind. The strongest portion is in front, and is formed by a band which, descend- ing from the region of the anterior inferior iUac spine, spreads out below, and is attached to the spiral line as low as the level of the lesser trochanter. It is called the Rio- femoral ligament, and is very seldom torn in any dislocation of the joint. Two other thickened bands should be looked Fig! 166.â€”Hip-joint from in Front. R.F. Kectus Femoris.

This last band is attached to the pubis below the ilio-pectineal eminence and runs to the femur in front of the lesser trochanter. The Aveakest portion of the capsule, on the other hand, is below and behind, and it is through this part that the head of the femur almost invariably passes in dislocations. The limb should be manipulated so as to bring the head of the bone forcibly against this portion of the capsule, the thinness of

45 THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS The only branches which concern the dissector of the posterior triangle are: (1) the nerve to the rhomboids; (2) the nerve to the subclavius; (3) the posterior thoracic nerve; (4) the suprascapular nerve.

Both it and the suprascapular nerve may be seen coming off" the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves to form the upper trunk, while the origins of the other two cannot at present be seen since they pierce the scalenus medius.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 252 gland is in contact with the floor of the cartilaginous part of the tube (see Fig. 113). The Tympanic Membrane [membrana tympani].â€”The section on the right side has passed through the tympanic membrane, but it is easy to see that the tympanic ring on which it is stretched is obliquely placed, the lower part being nearer the mid line than the upper (Fig. 113). In order to get a good view of the outer surface of the membrane the left bone should be taken, and the antero- inferior wall of the bony meatus cut away Avith chisel and forceps. By far the best implement for this purpose is the parrot-bill forceps, a pair of which should be in every well- equipped dissecting-room. Notice that the bone which has just been removed is the tympanic plate, and that in front of it the parotid gland rests. Sometimes, though not very often in the adult, this plate is perforated, as it always is in childhood up to about the sixth year. Now look at the outer surface of the membrane, and notice that it is not only oblique from above downwards, but from before backwards, its anterior end being nearer the middle line of the body than its posterior. If a third ear is available a horizontal section should be made from the external to the internal meatus. This shows the obliquity of the membrane just mentioned very well (see Fig. 114). In the child the membrane is more horizontal and a good deal nearer the surface of the head. The membrane is shghtly concave at its centre, which is known as the umbo, while running downwards and a little backwards to this point the handle of the malleus can be seen through the semi-transparent structure. Behind and parallel to this the long process of the incus may sometimes be made out indistinctly. At the upper and front part of the membrane, Avhere the root of the handle of the malleus lies, a little knob of bone is seen pushing against the inner surface of the membrane and

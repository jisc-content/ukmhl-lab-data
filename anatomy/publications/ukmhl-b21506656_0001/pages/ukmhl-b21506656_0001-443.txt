423 THE FOOT in front of the external posterior tubercle. As these two heads are traced forward they will be found to unite and become inserted into the deep surface of the flexor longus digitorum tendon. Review once more the nerve supply from the external plantar; there is often a separate branch for each head (Fig. 179). The four lumhricales will be found rising from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum after it has divided for the toes. Notice that the innermost lumbrical only rises from the inner side of one tendon, while the other three rise from neighbouring sides of two. Each muscle soon narrows into a delicate tendon, and runs forward round the tibial side of its own toe to reach the dorsal expansion of the extensor tendon, where it is inserted. The nerves to these little muscles need a good deal of care to see properly. The nerve to the first or innermost lumbrical has been found already coming from the internal plantar and entering the muscle on its superficial aspect. The nerves to the second and third enter the muscles on their deep surfaces near their tendons. The muscles must be very gently turned aside, when the delicate nerves will be found curving round the distal border of the subjacent adductor transversus hallucis muscle. The nerve to the fourth lumbrical does not enter it so far forward as the other two, because there is here no adductor transversus muscle for it to wind round. Clear away these muscles of the second layer by cutting the two long flexors where they cross one another, and also the two heads of origin of the accessorius; the whole layer may then be turned forward and the muscles of the third layer displayed. This third layer of the sole consists of four musclesâ€”the flexor brevis hallucis, the adductor obliquus hallucis, the adductor transversus hallucis, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti. The flexor brevis hallucis lies deep to the tendon of the flexor longus, and will be seen to rise from the ligaments on

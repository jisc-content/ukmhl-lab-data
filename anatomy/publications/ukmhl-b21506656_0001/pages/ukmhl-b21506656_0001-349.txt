329 THE BllAlN down its anterior wall, while the posterior .pillar of the fornix is seen on its inner and posterior aspect. With the fornix the choroid plexus is continued down into the cornu. Between the descending and posterior horn there is a triangular space on the floor of the ventricle known as the trigonum ventriculi [trigonum collaterale]. The whole extent of the cavity of the descending horn should be explored with a bent probe or seeker, and it will then be found that the cavity, after sinking downwards and outwards, turns forwards and inwards in the temporal lobe and ends blindly an inch to an inch and a half from the temporal pole. It is best exposed from the outer side by passing a knife along the probe into the cavity, and then cutting outwards to the surface along the line of the parallel fissure. After this enough of the temporal lobe may be cut away to see the structures lying in the descending horn (see Fig. 144). It should, however, be remembered that this horn has already been opened from the inner (medial) side in the first brain when the convolutions on the medial aspect were being studied. After stripping the pia mater off the surface of the hippocampal convolution, the choroid plexus was dragged out through the choroid fissure and thus the ventricle was opened. It is evident, therefore, that the descending horn lies very much nearer the medial than the lateral part of the temporal lobe (see Fig. 152). The most important structure in the descending horn is the liippocam'pxbs major, which corresponds to the inpushing of the dentate fissure. It begins behind the posterior pillar of the fornix as the latter is dropping down, and rapidly enlarges as it runs forwards along the floor until it ends in front as the pes hippocampi [digitationes hippocampi], which resembles an animal's paw, since it has three digits distinctly marked out by vertical grooves.

210 PRACTICAL ANATOMY 7 mm.) to the sclero-corneal junction. These points are often useful in determining the side to which an extirpated eyeball belongs. The inferior rectus muscle rises below the optic foramen, and runs forwards and outwards, to be inserted in a corre- sponding position on the lower hemisphere of the eyeball to that occupied by the insertion of the superior rectus on the upper. Cut the inferior rectus and raise the eyeball in order to see the next muscle. The inferior oblique muscle rises from the antero-internal part of the floor of the orbit, and runs backwards and out- wards below the inferior rectus to be inserted into the postero- external part of the eyeball; it will therefore pull the back of the globe inwards and downwards, and so make the cornea look upwards and outwards. The superior rectus, it will be remembered, makes the eye look upwards and inwards, so that, if the two muscles act together, the eye will look straight upwards. In the same way it will be realised that the inferior rectus, acting with the superior obhque, will direct the eye straight downwards. For purely vertical movements of the eye, therefore, the proper rectus will always act with the other obhque muscle. The inferior obhque may be better exposed by cutting and reflecting the inferior rectus. On the left side a dissec- tion of the inferior obhque should be made from the front by cuttmg through the inferior palpebral ligament (see Fig. 98). The sixth nerve enters the orbit through the anterior lacerated foramen, and passes between the two heads of the external rectus, on the outer side of the lower division of the third nerve. It very soon enters the ocular surface of the external rectus, which it supplies. On reviewing the contents of the posterior half of the orbit, it will be noticed that the fourth, frontal (5 f.) and lacrimal (5 1.) nerves are above; then come the levator palpebrie and superior rectus muscles (M.); then the upper

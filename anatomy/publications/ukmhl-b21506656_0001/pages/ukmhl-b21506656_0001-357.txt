THE BRAIN 337 ■were studied, has been left undissected, a series of transverse vertical or coronal sections may be made in it, although they are not as satisfactory as they would be if a complete third brain could be devoted to their study. The accompanying five photographs of sections taken at definite points will enable the dissector to recognise most of the structures he comes across in his own sections, which may, of course, be much more numerous. If a complete brain can be devoted to this purpose it should be laid on a dish which has been turned upside down, the base should be upward and the convex upper surface should be well padded up with tow. The longest knife obtain- able should be used to make the sections, which should be done with clean, sweeping cuts. Fig. 149.—Section through the Tip of the Temporal Lobe. a.

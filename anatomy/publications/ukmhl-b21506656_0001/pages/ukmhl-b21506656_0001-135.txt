THE I^ACE il5 The puncta lacrimalia should now be enlarged from the deep surface of the eyelid and a fine seeker or wire pushed along the Ganalictdi into' the lacrimal sac. The upper canaliculus at first runs upwards and the lower downwards, but they very soon both turn inwards and often unite before opening into the lacrimal sac. Slit them up in their whole length, an operation which will lead into the Lacrimal Sac, or upper dilated part of the nasal duct. This sac lies behind the main part of the internal tarsal ligament, but a posterior sHp of the ligament passes behind it, accompanied by a few fibres of the orbicu- laris palpebrarum muscle, which are known as the Tensor Tarsi [M. tarsalis inferior]. The lacrimal sac may be opened from in front by draw- ing both eyehds outwards; this makes the internal tarsal ligament tense and easily felt through the skin, and a fine knife may be passed backwards and inwards close to the bone, into the sac, either just above or just below the ligament. As soon as the region of the eyelids has been dissected, place a pad of cotton wool moistened with weak formalin, or a mixture of equal parts of glycerine spirit and water, between what is left of the lids and the eyeball to keep the front of the orbit from drying up. Clear away the orbital part of the orbicularis palpebrarum and look for the corrugator swpercilii, a small muscle rising from the inner part of the supraciliary eminence and runnino- upwards and outwards to the skin of the forehead, which its fibres reach by interlacing with those of the orbicularis and frontalis. Togetherjvith the iipper fibres of the orbicularis, it causes the characteristic vertical wrinkles above the root of the nose when it contracts. Below the orbit the whole extent of the levator lahii sxipertor%s proprius [M. quadratus labii superioris] is seen rismg from just below the infraorbital margin and coverino- the mfraorbital foramen. It passes down to the upper lipÂ°

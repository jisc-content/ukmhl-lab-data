PRACTICAL ANATOMY 38 None of their attachments can at present be seen. The boundary between the two first muscles is difficult to deter- mine, but the splenius capitis generally extends for about 1^ inch from the apex of the triangle. In cleaning the levator anguli scapulae look out for its nerve, which comes from the third and fourth cervical and enters the muscle on its exposed surface. The Scalenus posticus is sunk in a smaU triangle between the levator scapulae and the scalenus medius. Its attachments have been studied already (p. 12). In cleaning the scalenus medius look out for two nerves piercing it; the larger one is either a part or the whole of the posterior thoracic [N. thoracalis posterior] or nerve of Bell, while the smaller is the nerve to the rhomboids [N. dorsalis scapulae], which pierces the muscle above and behind the last. This nerve runs down close to the lower border of the levator anguli scapulae to which it gives off a few branches. On its way it is joined and accompanied by the posterior scapular artery [A. circumflexa scapulae], one of the two branches of the transversalis colli, itself a branch of the thyroid axis (see Fig. 18). The transversalis colli generally divides on the scalenus medius into posterior scapular and superficial cervical branches, though sometimes the former comes off directly from the third part of the subclavian. Now dissect the small Supraclavicular Triangle, keeping the arm pulled down as much as possible. If the shoulder is pushed up the triangle is non-existent, since its upper boundary, the omo-hyoid, lies behind its lower, the clavicle. The most important structures in this space are the third part of the subclavian artery and the brachial plexus. lite third part of the suhclavian artery [A. subclavia] may be marked out superficially by taking a point from half to one inch above the clavicle along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and drawing a line with a slight con-

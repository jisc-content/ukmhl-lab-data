316 PRACTICAL ANATOMY embedded in the pia mater just before entering or just after leaving the brain. In cleaning the first brain the dissector will have acquired a good deal of practical experience of the pia mater, but it should be remembered that opposite the convexity of the con- volutions the pia mater and arachnoid are really confluent. The Vessels of the Beain The cerebral veins for the most part open into the superior longitudiual sinus, though some pass down into the lateral and cavernous sinuses. They are very thin-walled, and mainly lie in the superficial part of the sulci, while the cere- bral arteries lie deeper. Their peculiar mode of entering the superior longitudinal siaus has already been noticed (see p. 61). The Circle of Willis [circulus arteriosus] should now be exposed by freely opening up the cisterna basalis and cisterna pontis. Notice how the internal carotid artery lies in the concavity formed by the optic nerve and optic tract on each side; here it is usually joined by the posterior com- municating artery from the posterior cerebral, and then at once gives off the anterior choroidal artery, which runs back parallel and just external to the optic tract, to enter the choroid fissure and so reach the choroid plexus of the de- scending horn of the lateral ventricle. After giving off this branch, the internal carotid divides into anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral artery of each side runs forwards and inwards to the beginning of the longitudinal fissure, giving off the antero-medial ganglionic branches, which go through holes in the inner part of the anterior perforated space between the roots of the olfactory tract. These, like all the other ganglionic branches, are "end arteries," and never anastomose with one another, so that if one is blocked the area of brain to which it is distributed is irrevocably cut off from all blood.

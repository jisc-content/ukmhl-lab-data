SPHENO-MAXILLARY FOSSA 223 middle lacei-cated foramen, it is seen to be formed by the union of the great superficial petrosal nerve ah-eady exposed in the dissection of the middle cranial fossa (see p. 81) and the great deep petrosal, which comes from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic in the carotid canal. The Vidian branch of the internal maxillary artery [A. canalis pterygoidei] accompanies the nerve backwards through its canal. The three roots of Meckel's ganglion have now been accounted for. The sensory are the twigs by which the I ganghon hangs from the second division of the fifth, the motor is the great superficial petrosal from the facial, and the sympathetic is the great deep petrosal from the carotid plexus. The pterygo-palatine branch of Meckel's ganglion is a very small nerve which runs back to the roof of the pharynx j in the pterygo-palatine canal, just internal to the root of the internal pterygoid plate; it therefore lies internal and inferior to the Vidian. To find it strip the mucous membrane away in this region, and break the sphenoidal process of the palate away from the sphenoid. The last branches of Meckel's ganglion, the naso-palatine and upper nasal branches, have been seen in the nose, and may be traced to the ganglion by enlarging the spheno- palatine foramen; in other words, by cutting away some of the delicate vertical plate of the palate with a chisel or strong scissors. In this way the ganglion can be exposed from its inner side, and the naso-palatine artery traced into the fossa. Before leaving this region it may be well to recapitulate the structures passing through the various openings in the spheno-maxillary fossa. They are: In the roof (spheno- maxillary fissure), infraorbital nerve, infraorbital artery, temporo-malar nerve. In the floor: 1. (posterior palatine canal), Great palatine nerve and artery; 2. (accessory palatine canals), accessory palatine nerves.

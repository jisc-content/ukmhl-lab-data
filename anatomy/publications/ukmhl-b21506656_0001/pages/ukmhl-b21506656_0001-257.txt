' 237 THE LARYNX Each of these joints has a definite capsule and synovial membrane, which, in the case of the crico-aiytenoid articula- tion, is specially lax, in order that the arytenoids may glide towards and away from one another. Now make a sagittal mesial section through the whole larynx and explore the laryngeal saccule with a seeker. After passing through the oval opening between the true and false cords the seeker may be pushed upwards for half to three-quarters of an inch, so that the secretion of the mucous membrane of the saccule must flow down over the true cords and keep them moist. The submucous tissue of the larynx is plentiful except in two places, one at the back of the epiglottis and the other over the true vocal cords. Try to strip off the mucous membrane, and notice how closely it is bound down to the subjacent tissues in these regions. Elsewhere the mucous membrane can be raised with the greatest ease. A practical point in connection with this is that in oedema of the larynx, such as is sometimes caused by a child trying to drink boiling water out of the spout of a kettle, the in- flammatory exudation which is in the submucous tissue does not pass below the true vocal cords. The mucous membrane of the upper part of the larynx is continuous with that of the pharynx, while below it is continuous with that of the trachea. After the mucous membrane has been investigated the cartilages should be cleaned but not separated from one another. The thyroid, cricoid, and epiglottis will, of course, have been cut in half, but this matters httle. If these cartilages are drawn from different points of view, their shape and relations will soon be appreciated and re- membered. Notice especiaUy the leaf-like shape of the epiglottis the stalk of which is known as the thyro-epiglottic ligament'and IS attached to the thyroid cartilage just above the anterior attachments of the true vocal cords.

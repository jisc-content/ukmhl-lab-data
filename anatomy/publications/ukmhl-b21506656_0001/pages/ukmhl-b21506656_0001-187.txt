THE NECK 167 Internally are communicating twigs with the glosso- pharyngeal, vagus, and hypoglossal nerves, the search for which may be deferred until later. In addition to these are pharyngeal and laryngeal branches, joining the corresponding branches of the vagus, and the superior cervical cardiac branch of the sympathetic, which runs down behind the carotid, and on the right side may pass either superficial or deep to the first part of the subclavian artery. On the left side it is always superficial, since it goes to the superficial cardiac plexus. The middle cervical ganglion [G. cervicale medium] is a long way below the upper and is much smaller. It usually lies just in front of the highest convexity of the inferior thyroid artery at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, and has communication with the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. These are not diflficult to find, and, H .e all the other cervical rami communicantes, only contain grey or non- medullated fibres which pass from the ganglion to the spinal nerves. No white rami communicantes are found in the neck. Internally, delicate vasomotor twigs follow the inferior thyroid artery to the thyroid gland. A middle cervical cardiac nerve runs down from the ganglion to the deep cardiac plexus, though this branch may come from the connective or main cord of the sym- pathetic above or below the ganglion. The middle cervical ganglion is very variable in position and size, and often lies deep instead of superficial to the inferior thyroid artery. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion [G. cervicale inferius] lies behind the first part of the subclavian artery, near the origin of the vertebral. To see it the subclavian artery should be cut through just internal to the origin of the thyroid axis, and hooked inwards. This ganglion lies between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the head of the first rib, and is often fused with the first thoracic ganglion, which lies a little lower down. It gives

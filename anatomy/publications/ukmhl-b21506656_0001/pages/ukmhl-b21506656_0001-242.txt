PKACTICAL ANATOMY 222 to tlie posterior dental canals on the zygomatic surface of the maxilla. They are accompanied by small branches of the internal maxillary artery. Hanging from the infraorbital nerve, or, more correctly speaking, from the maxillary division of the fifth, by two or three branches, Meckel's ganglion will be seen, though in order to get a good view it may be necessary to clear away the termination of the internal maxillary artery; a small loss, since its branches accompany those of the ganglion, and when once these are seen can be easily understood. The ganglion is about the size of a grape seed, and running down from it are three descending branches, the Great and Accessory palatine nerves; they soon enter the posterior palatine canals, which may be laid open with the chisel. The descending palatine artery which accompanies the Great palatine nerve is quite a large branch. Kunning into Meckel's ganglion from behind is the Vidian nerve [N. canalis pterygoidei], which passes through the Vidian canal, a tunnel through the root of the pterygoid plates. If it is decided to follow up this canal, it is best to saw back through the great wing of the sphenoid from just internal to the foramen rotundum to the outer part of the foramen lacerum medium in the middle cranial fossa. This being done, the outer wall of the canal may be chiselled ^^'^The student is advised to attempt these more difficult pieces of dissection, even if he is unsuccessful, as the technical skill in using the chisel will stand him in good stead later on. In dissecting-rooms attached to hospitals it is generally possible to procure an assortment of chisels, forceps, and saws from the instrument-room, Avhich have been discarded owing to their being of a slightly obsolete pattern, and these can be lent by the senior demonstrator as they are required. . i i fi,a When the Vidian nerve has been traced back to tlie

64 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The cerebral hemispheres may now be lifted out of the skull, noticing that the only nervous structures which have been divided are the optic nerves, one olfactory tract, the infundibulum, and the crura cerebri. Notice that here and there small veins which pass from Fig. 31.â€”Coronal Section through the Back of a Skull to show THE Processes of the Dura Mater in Relation to the Sinuses. Chl.D.M.

These are sometimes known as " anchor veins," and are of importance in operations upon the brain. Put plenty of tow or cotton-Avool into a pot, place the brain upside down upon it and cover it with strong spirit.

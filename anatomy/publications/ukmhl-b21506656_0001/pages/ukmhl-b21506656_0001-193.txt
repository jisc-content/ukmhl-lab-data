173 THE NECK of the artery. It is frequently embedded in the post-styloid lobe of the parotid gland (see p. 153), and in removing the gland a piece of the posterior auricular artery is often cut out with that structure. The artery reaches the skull close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, through which it sends a branch into the aqueductus Fallopii. Here, of course, the posterior auricular artery crosses deep to the facial nerve. In its'upward course it will be seen to cross superficial to the internal jugular vem, internal carotid artery, and the spinal accessory nerve, and it will be noticed that whereas the occipital artery is in relation with the loAver border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, the posterior auricular runs close to the upper border of that muscle (see Fig. 85). Between the external auditory meatus and the mastoid process the artery becomes superficial, after which it divides into its auricular and occipital branches. The spinal accessory nerve [N. accessorius] is a very obvious structure, and should be picked up where it enters the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid, usually about the level of the angle of the jaw, or an inch below the tip of the mastoid process, which is the guide most often used by the surgeon. Close to the base of the skull it emerges just in front of the internal jugular vein, and then runs down- wards and backwards superficial to that structure and deep to the posterior auricular and occipital arteries as well as to the posterior belly of the.digastric (see Fig. 86). Its course on the surface of the neck may be marked by taking a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the tip of the mastoid process and another half-way down the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. A line joining these two points and prolonged to the anterior border of the trapezius will approximately correspond to that of the nerve. The relation of the spinal accessory to the transverse

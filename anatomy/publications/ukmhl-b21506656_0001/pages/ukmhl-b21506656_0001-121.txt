101 THE NECK Dissection of the External Carotid Artery The next dissection is to follow up the external carotid artery and its branches, by doing which the structures in the upper part of the neck will be met and can be investigated. The common carotid artery bifurcates about the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and just before its bifurcation it enlarges. The external carotid [A. car^tis externa] hes in front of the internal and runs up to the angle of the jaw, where it passes into the substance of the parotid gland. In this part of its course it is most convenient to consider the relations as antero-external and postero- internal. The Antero-external Relations of the External Carotid Artery are— Bones.—ISTone, until the angle of the jaw is reached. Muscles.—Platysma, Digastric, and Stylo-hyoid. Arteries.—None. Veins.—Common Facial and Lingual. Nerves.—Hypoglossal and Ramus Descendens Hypoglossi. Glandular and other Structures.—Nothing until the parotid gland is reached. The muscles and fascia have already been investigated as far as this can be done at present. The common facial vein [V. facialis communis] is generally formed by the union of the anterior branch of the temporo- maxillary vein joining the facial vein in the submaxillary triangle; it is, however, like all veins, liable to considerable variation. The main vein from the tongue is generally the ranine. which receives the vence comites of the lingual artery and the dorsalis Ungues vein, and so becomes the lingual. It may open separately into the internal jugular or may join the common facial.

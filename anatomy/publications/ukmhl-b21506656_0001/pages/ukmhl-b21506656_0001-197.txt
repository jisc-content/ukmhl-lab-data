177 THE NECK artery it is more liable to injury in opening abscesses of the tonsil, because it lies in the direct line of the knife-thrust if this goes too deep. The structures which lie betAveen the external and in- ternal carotid arteries should now be revised; they are— Bones.—The styloid process near its tip. Muscles.—The stylo-pharyngeus and, if the styloid pro- cess is short, the stylo-glossus. Fibrous Structures.—The stylo-hyoid ligament if the styloid process is short. Arteries.—The ascending pharyngeal. Veins.—Descending pharyngeal veins draining the pharyngeal plexus into the internal jugular. Nerves.—The glosso-pharyngeal and pharyngeal branches of the vagus. Glandular Structures.—Parotid gland and carotid body. All these have been noticed already, except the last, which is a small mass of tissue, probably belonging to the sympa- thetic system, lying in the fork between the origins of the external and internal carotids. It is best found by twisting these two arteries round, but can seldom be satisfactorily demonstrated by macroscopical methods. In addition to the structures named as lying between the internal and external carotid arteries, it must be remembered that the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve are external relations of the former, that the superior laryngeal nerve is internal, and that the rectus capitis anticus major and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic are posterior. As a rule, no branches of any importance are given ofi" by the internal carotid artery in the neck.

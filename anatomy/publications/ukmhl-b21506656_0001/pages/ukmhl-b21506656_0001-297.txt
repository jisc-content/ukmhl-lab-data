THE INTERNAL EAR 277 semicircular canals, wliich do not nearly till the bony canals, except at their ampullated ends. The bony vestibule has perilymph between its walls and those of the utricle and saccule, and this is continuous with the perilymph in the scala vestibuli of the cochlea. At the apex of the cochlea is a place known as the helicotrema, at which the scala vestibuli becomes continuous with the scala tympani, but when the base of the cochlea is reached once more, the scala tympani ends blindly, its blind end being separated from the tympanum by the fenestra rotunda, across which is stretched the secondary membrane of the tympanum. The different divisions of the auditory nerve end, as has been seen, in various parts of the membranous labyrinth. If the foregoing arrangements are clearly understood, the grosser points in the mechanism of hearing will be easily grasped. ' A sound wave strikes the tympanic membrane, presses it in, and so is communicated to the handle of the malleus. The malleus, however, is a lever, the fulcrum of which is the anterior ligament and the posterior fibres of the superior hgament, so that, as the handle moves in, the head moves out. The incus is also a lever, the fulcrum of which is at the short process, and as the head moves outwards with the head of the malleus, the long process moves in. This, of course, pushes tbe stapes farther into the fenestra ovahs, and in- creases the pressure in the perilymph of the vestibule. The increased tension passes up the scala vestibuh and then down the scala tympani, at the bottom of which it can bulge out the secondary membrane of the tympanum stretched across the fenestra rotunda; but in doing this an extra pressure is transmitted to the wall of the scala media, and so through its endolymph to the organ of Corti.

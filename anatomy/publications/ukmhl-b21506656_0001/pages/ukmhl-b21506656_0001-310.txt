PRACTICAL ANATOMY 290 1 The small posterior part is continuous with the infundi- bulum, and is received into a notch in the posterior surface of the anterior part; it is a down growth of the brain. Behind the tuber cinereum are a pair of small white hemispheres called the corpoka albicantia [c. mammillaria], and behind these again the posterior perforated space is seen lying between the crura cerebri. The Cruea Cerebri [pedunculi cerebri] were cut in removing the cerebrum, but may be easily reconstructed by replacing the cerebellum. They will then be seen to diverge from the upper part of the pons Varolii, which unites the two halves of the cerebellum, and to disappear under cover of the uncus (see Fig. 130). Now follow the optic tract backwards, and in order to do so draw aside the temporal lobe. As it runs back round the outer side of the crus the tract broadens and divides into an outer and an inner root. The outer root [radix lateralis] again divides, so that there are now three bandsâ€”outer, middle, and inner. Of these the outer ends in a swelling, the external geni- culate body [corpus geniculatum laterale], while the inner band passes into the internal geniculate body [e.g. mediale], which is a more sharply-marked swelling than the outer, and is situated rather farther back on the dorsal side of the crus. Behind and above these two swellings (when the brain is in its natural position) is the overhanging hind end of the optic thalamus, known as the pulvinar, and between this and the internal geniculate body the middle of the three divisions of the optic tract passes to the upper quadrigeminal body (see Fig. 129). This third division of the tract is called the superior brachium. j j i, j- The Corpora Quadrigemina are four rounded bodies which lie dorsal to, i.e. above, the crura cerebri, and below and internal to the pulvinar.

THE NECK 159 now that the chavicle is removed, it is evident that the parts of the vein internal to and external to the scalenus anticus are extremely short; indeed the former is usually non- existent (see Fig. 78). The opening of the external jugular vein into the outer part of the subclavian vein, which was hidden by the clavicle in the dissection of the posterior triangle, is now seen, and Tig. 79.â€”Diagram of the Great Veins at the Boot of the Left Side of the Neck laid open.

The lower part of the internal jugular and the whole of the subclavian vein should noAv be slit open and cleaned out. Just above its junction with the subclavian the internal jugular shows a well-marked bicuspid valve, and under cover

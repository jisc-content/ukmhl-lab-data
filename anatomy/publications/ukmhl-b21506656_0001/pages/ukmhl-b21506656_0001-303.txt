THE BRAIN 283 from the occipital lobe, while below is the lower margin of the brain. The tip of this tongue-shaped lobe which projects forwards is known as the Temporal pole. The Parietal Lobe occupies the rest of the external surface of the cerebrum, and is bounded in front by the central fissure, behind by the artificial boundary of the occipital lobe and the external parieto - occipital fissure, above by the upper border of the brain, and below by Fig. 126.â€”Insula or Island of Reil of the Left Side WITH THE OpERCDLA HOOKED ASIDE.

The Island of Reil, Insula or Central Lobe should be looked for by drawing apart the edges of the Sylvian fissure; this does not give an altogether complete view of it, but later on the various opercula may be cut away, after which it will be fully exposed. It is triangular with the apex below, and is bounded on every side except at the apex by the limiting sidms [s.

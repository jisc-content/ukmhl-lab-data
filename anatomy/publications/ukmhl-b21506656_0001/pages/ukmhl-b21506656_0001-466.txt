PRACTICAL ANATOMY 446 The most important point is to notice the way in which the base of the second metatarsal is let in between the inner and outer cuneiform bones. Inter-metatarsal joint cavities extend a httle way between the bases of the four outer metatarsal bones and are continuous with the tarso-metatarsal cavities. They are provided with dorsal, plantar, and interosseous hgaments [ligg. basium]. The Metatarso-phalangeal Joints First lay open this joint in the great toe from the dorsum, remembering its great clinical importance in gouty people; notice how feeble the dorsal part of the capsule is, though the lateral and plantar parts a-re thick and strong. _ Two sesamoid bones have already been seen embedded in the plantar ligament, their cartilage-covered faces playing against the grooves on the plantar surface of the head of the meta- tarsal bone. Notice that the concave articular surface on the base of the proximal phalanx of this toe is obhquely placed, so that the toe is directed outwards towards the others, giving the foot a somewhat pomted end. This arrangement is found in races which have never worn boots, so that "anatomical boots" with straight inner sides have nothing really to justify them in anatomy. The other metatarso-phalangeal joints differ from that of the great toe in their small size and lateral compres- sion of the articular surfaces on the heads of the meta- tarsal bones. There are no sesamoid bones m the plantar or glenoid ligaments, which are very dense, except^ near their metatarsal attachment. These Hgaments are jomed too-ether by the deep transverse metatarsal hgament (see p "426) As these joints allow abduction and adduction as well as flexion and extension, they are called condyloicl joints or condylarthroses.

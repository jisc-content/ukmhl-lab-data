For the inner wall of the tympanum, the other half of the section of the left bone must be studied (Fig. 117). Directly opposite the tympanic ring and membrane is a u convexity known as the promontory. On its surface are • some delicate grooves for the nerves of the tympanic plexus formed by the branching of Jacobsen's nerve (tympanic 1 branch of the glosso-pharyngeal), which comes from the i| petrous ganglion of the ninth cranial nerve and enters the VOL.

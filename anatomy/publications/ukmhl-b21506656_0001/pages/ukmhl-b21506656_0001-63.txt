43 THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY ^r«e?"ies.—Transversalis Colli (probably indirect). Veins.—Transversalis Colli. Nerves.—The greater part of the Brachial Plexus. Glandular and other Structures.—Some of the Supra- clavicular Lymph Nodes. The only Lower Relation of the artery is the First Rib. The composition of the Brachial plexus should be studied with the dissector of the upper extremity, who by this time will have his axilla well exposed. The middle third of the clavicle should be removed, leaving the attachments of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius untouched, but removing with the clavicle a good deal of the subclavius muscle. In doing this the nerve to the subclavius may be traced to its muscle. It will now be seen that the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus pass from the neck into the axilla through a triangular aperture formed by the first rib internally, the clavicle in front and the scapula behind. Define the outer edge of the scalenus anticus just behind that of the sterno-mastoid. Coming out between the scalenus anticus and medius are the anterior primary divisions of the 5th, Qth, 1th, and 8th cervical nerves, while a large contribution from the first thoracic nerve ascends in front of the shaft of the first rib close to its neck. The fifth and sixth nerves join together to form the upper trunk, the seventh goes on as the middle trunk, while the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves join to form the lower trunk (see Fig. 20). The formation of these three trunks generally takes place close to the outer edge of the scalenus anticus. After a short course each trunk divides into anterior and posterior secondary divisions. It is convenient to speak of these as "secondary" to avoid any mental confusion with the primary division which each nerve undergoes on emerging from the spinal canal. The anterior secondary divisions of the upper and middle

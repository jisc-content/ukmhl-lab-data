364 PRACTICAL ANATOMY vessels, and there is usually one node in relation to the external saphenous vein just after it has pierced the deep fascia. It is of surgical importance to notice that the popliteal artery does not lie in contact with the popliteal surface of the femur, but is separated from it by half an inch of fat. The structures within the space having been dissected out, it is now advisable to clean its boundaries. The ham- string muscles should first be cleaned, but only so far as they form the boundaries of the space. It is not convenient to carry the dissection beyond these limits at present. In cleaning the semi-membranosus muscle and in tracing it to its insertion into the groove at the back of the inner tuberosity of the tibia, the tendon of the muscle will in most cases be seen to be separated from the bone by a well-de- veloped bursa which may communicate with one lower down, common to the semi-membranosus and inner head of the gastrocnemius. Deep to the inner hamstrings will be seen the Adductor Magnus muscle and tendon, both of which should be care- fully cleaned, the opening between the two, through which the popliteal vessels enter the space, being defined. An examination of the outer hamstring (biceps) will show that it possesses two heads, one of which—the long—is com- posed of vertical fibres descending from the tuber ischii, the other—the short—of fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the linea aspera and external supra-condylar ridge of the femur to join the deep aspect of the common tendon of insertion. Between the adductor magnus inter- nally and the short head of the biceps externally a triangular portion of the femur is left almost uncovered by muscle— the so-called popliteal surface. The lower boundary of the popliteal space on the mside is formed by the inner head of the Qastrocnemius, which arises from the upper and back part of the internal condyle, just below the adductor tubercle of the femur.

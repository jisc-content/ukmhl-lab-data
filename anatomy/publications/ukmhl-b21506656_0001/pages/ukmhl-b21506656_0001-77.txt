THE PINNA 57 external auditory meatus as an oblique ridge called the crus helicis. Where it has finished its upper arch^ and is beginning to run down the hinder border of the pinna, it I often shows a little triangular widening known as Darwin's I hibercle. Below, the helix ends in the soft lobule of the ear, which I varies so grea tly in size in different people, and is the part pierced for earrings. Running up from the lobule, parallel with the helix, is another ridge, the Antihelix [Anthelix], while between the two is the fossa of the helix. In the upper part of the pinna the antihelix divides to enclose a triangular fossa sometimes called the fossa of the I Antihelix, sometimes the fossa triangularis. The deep hollow bounded above and behind by the I antihelix, from the bottom of which the external auditory i meatus leads, is the concha [cavum conchse], and is divided ' into an upper and lower part by the crus helicis. In front of the external auditory meatus and overlapping it is a triangular flap called the tragus, while a little below I and behind is another slighter flap projecting forwards from where the antihelix joins the lobule. This is the antitragus, and it is separated from the tragus by a well-marked inter- tragic notch [incisura intertragica]. When the cranial or inner surface of the pinna is looked at, eminences will be seen corresponding to the three fossas; one for the concha, one for the fossa of the helix, and a third for that of the antihelix. The two dissectors should next remove the skin and notice the positions of the muscles on one pinna, the other I having been used for the cutaneous nerves. Six small intrinsic muscles will be seen which, although of morphological interest, are of no practical importance. Their names and position are shown in the accompanying , diagrams (Figs. 27 and 28), and twigs of the facial nerve may with the greatest care be traced to them.

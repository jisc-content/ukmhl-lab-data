SPHENO-MAXILLARY FOSSA 221 Spheno-maxillary Fossa [F. Pfcerygo-palatina] This space should be carefully studied on the dried skull, and its various openings noticed before any dissection is attempted. In it lie the terminal part of the internal maxillary artery, a short length of the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, and the spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion, hanging from the latter. As these structures give off numerous branches, the small space is well filled, and their satisfactory exposure calls for some skill and ingenuity. Two or three small French nails driven into a block of wood at convenient distances make a good rest for support- ing the part in various positions, while a fret-saw,- small sharp chisel, and small bone forceps or very strong scissors are the best tools with which to work. The dry skull must, of course, be at hand for reference. First follow the internal maxillary artery into the fossa through the pterygo-maxillary fissure. Next localise the infraorbital nerve in the groove in the floor of the orbit, and cut away all that part of the maxilla, which lies external to the groove with the saw and forceps. This will give more room at once. Now trace the nerve from the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure across the roof of the fossa to the foramen rotundum in the posterior wall, and notice that in passing backwards the nerve runs almost directly inwards along the top of the posterior part of the maxilla. Cut away the top of the foramen rotundum, and the whole length of the infraorbital nerve is exposed. Entering the orbit with the nerve is the infraorbital branch of the internal maxillary artery. If the infraorbital nerve is now cut in the posterior part of the orbit and drawn gently backwards, its two posterior superior dental twigs may be seen, and may be traced down

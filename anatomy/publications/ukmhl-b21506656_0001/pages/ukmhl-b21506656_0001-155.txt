135 THE PTERYGOID REGION opening the mouth, both the hinge movement below the meniscus and the forward gliding movement above it occur together. The attachments of the external pterygoid can , now be verified—the upper head comifig from the pterygoid I ridge and the part of the great wing of the sphenoid internal to it; the lower from the outer surface of the external ptery- I goid plate—while the insertion is into the front of the meniscus as well as into the neck of the condyle. M. C. Fig. 64.—Sagittal Section of Tejiporo-maxillaey Articulation. M. Meniscus. C. Condyle. The fibrous tissue of the external pterygoid muscle's insertion simply blends with that of the anterior part of the capsule and of the meniscus. On reflecting the muscle the nerve supplying it from the third division of the fifth should be carefully looked for on its deep surface. Now the lingual and inferior dental nerves may be followed up to where they diverge from the trunk of the third division of the fifth a little below the foramen ovale, and as this point is approached the beginning of the auriculo- temjporcd nerve should be looked for.

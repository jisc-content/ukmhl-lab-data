376 PKACTICAL ANATOMY anterior crural nerve is pulled outwards. If the interval between these two structures is now looked at, a fair-sized nerve should be seen, descending downwards and inwards from the anterior crural nerve and disappearing deep to the femoral artery, or between it and a large branch—the deep femoral. Having found this nerve, the dissector may now pass to the systematic dissection of the space. As the nerves are most liable to injury, it is well to begin Avith them. The ilio-inguinal, genito-crural, and external cutaneous nerves have been found already; they therefore only need careful reflecting. The branches of the Anterior Crural Nerve [N. femoris] must next be followed. Of these the nerve to the pectineus has been already exposed, as well as the internal and middle cutaneous nerves. The last of these is in no danger of being cut, but the internal cutaneous may be, unless it be re- membered that it passes downwards and inwards from its origin to cross the femoral artery, it being the only nerve crossing that artery in Scarpa's triangle. In tracing the branches of the anterior crural nerve it is not a bad plan to pass a pencil or a piece of wood deep to the trunk of the nerve as it appears under Poupart's liga- ment, thereby putting it upon the stretch. The nerve to the scvrtorms should be found next. It may be a direct and separate branch from the anterior crural, or, which is more frequent, it may be in a common sheath with the outer of the two middle cutaneous nerves. In some cases the branches of the anterior crural nerve will be seen to be divided into a superHcial and a deep set by an artery—the external circumflex or one of its branches. In such a case the superficial branches will be the internal and middle cutaneous nerves, and the nerves to the sartorms and pectineus (see p. 378). The deep branches will be seen passing downwards, to disappear deep to the sartorius muscle; some of them enter

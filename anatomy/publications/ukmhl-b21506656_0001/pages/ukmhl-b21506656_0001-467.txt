447 LIGAMENTS OF THE SOLE and extension, and are therefore ginglymus or hinge joints. If one is laid open from the dorsum it will be seen that the capsule closely resembles that of the metatarso-phalangeal joints, the dorsal ligament being very weak indeed, while the plantar and lateral are strong. The Ligaments of the Sole Three ligaments are of great importance in the sole; they are the inferior calcaneo-navicular and the long and short calcaneo-cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament has been seen from above and should now be studied from below, the tibiahs posticus tendon being drawn aside or removed. From this pomt of view it consists of fibrous bundles running forwards and inwards from the sustentaculum tali to the under surface of the navicular, instead of being smooth and cartilaginous m texture as it is above. Its large amount of elastic fibres give it the alternative name of the spring ligament (Fig. 189). The long calcaneo-cuhoid or long plantar ligament [lio- plantare longum] stretches from the under surface of the calcaneum, between the posterior and anterior tubercles to the ridge on the cuboid which forms the posterior lip of the groove for the peroneus longus tendon. From this attach- ment It IS prolonged forward to the bases of the second thn-d, fourth, and sometimes the fifth metatarsal bones in this way formmg a sheath for the peroneus longus. SHt open this sheath, and notice that where the peroneus lon-us IS turning round the outer edge of the foot a sesamoid car- Mage iÂ« developed in it. Very rarely this may be ossified. Notice that he tendon does not occupy the outer part of the groove m the cuboid except in extreme dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. Follow the tendon to its insertion into the base of the fi St metatarsal bone and the neighbouring part of the internal cuneiform. ^ ^ ^'^^

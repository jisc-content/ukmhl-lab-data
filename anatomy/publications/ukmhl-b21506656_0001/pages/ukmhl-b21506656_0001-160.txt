140 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The mylo-hyoid is now in full view, rising from the mylo- hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, and being inserted partly into a median raphe, which runs from the chin to the hyoid bone and partly into the lower part of the anterior surface of the M.M.

Now divide the mylo-hyoid muscle close to its attachment to the lower jaw and turn it down. The deep part of the submaxillary gland is now exposed, and its duct (Wharton's duct) [D. submaxillaris] must_ be carefully looked for, running forwards and upwards until it

$64 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The cells near the apex of the process are much smaller than those above during early life, and do not communicate with them at all, since they contain marrow instead of air and represent the unaltered diploe of the cranial bones. Below the aditus on the posterior wall of the tympanum is the continuation of the ridge formed by the aqueductus Fallopii. This has already been seen lying along the irmer border of the aditus, but as it curves downwards and back- wards it runs outwards a little as well. When it reaches the posterior wall it no longer forms an elevation, but is quite embedded in the bone between the tympanum and the mastoid cells, and here it is surrounded by walls of ivory-like density, so that the facial nerve is Httle Hable to accidental injury in interfering with this part of the tympanum. In the lower part of the longitudinal section the aqueduct will probably be opened up, since the saw-cut passed through the stylo-mastoid foramen (see Fig. 117). A little distance behind the fenestra oYalis the pyramid projects forwards from the posterior tympanic wall; it may have been damaged in the antero-posterior section, but will certainly be unharmed in the transverse one made on the right side. It is a small hollow cone, through the apex of which the stapedius tendon comes out and runs forwards to be inserted into the neck of the stapes, or, in other words, into that part of the stirrup which receives the stirrup leather. Just below the pyramid and behind the fenestra rotunda is a Httle pit, which is known as the suh-pyramidal fossa or smus tympani, and lies in the hollow of the posterior semi- circular canal. The iter chordce posteritis, through which the^ chorda tympani comes out of the aqueduct of Fallopius into the tympanum, lies just behind the posterior border of the tympanic membrane, between it and the outer side of the pyramid. The Auditory Ossicles consist of the malleus, mcus,

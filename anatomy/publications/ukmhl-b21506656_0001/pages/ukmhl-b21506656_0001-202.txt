182 PRACTICAL ANATOMY inserted into the pharyngeal tubercle of the basioccipital bone, while the lower ones end behind in the posterior median raphe (see Fig. 89). The middle constrictor has already been seen arising from the two cornua of the hyoid bone as well as from the stylo-hyoid ligament (see p. 145). Its upper fibres have the same upward and backward curve as those of the superior constrictor, and usually reach the pharyngeal tubercle. They hide the lower part of the upper constrictor. The inferior constrictor rises from the outer surface of the thyroid and slightly from the cricoid cartilage, but its exact attachment will be seen better when these parts are examined. Its upper fibres run up to within two inches of the pharyngeal tubercle, while its lower ones turn a little down to blend with the oesophagus. Between these points its insertion, like that of the other two constrictors, is into the posterior median raphe. In the region of the inferior constrictor the calibre of the pharynx diminishes rapidly to that of the oesophagus. Now measure the pharynx from the base of the skull to the level of the cricoid cartilage, where it ends. It will be found to be about five inches. Above the superior constrictor, between it and the skull, is a space known as the sinus of Morgagni, through which pass the Eustachian tube, the levator palati muscle, and the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery. These are embedded in rather dense cellular tissue, which extends for some distance down on the deep surface of the superior constrictor, and is known as the pharyngeal aponeurosis. The pterygo-mandihular ligament is a thickening of this. Notice that the sinus of Morgagni lies just internal to the exit of the fifth nerve from the foramen ovale, and therefore also close to the otic ganglion. The stylo-pharyngeus muscle may now be followed down from the posterior and deep surface of the styloid process,

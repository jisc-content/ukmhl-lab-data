15 THE SPINAL REGION The external branches will be found external to the corn- plexus, supplying the transversalis colU, trachelo-mastoid, splenius, and complexus. At this stage it may be well to recapitulate the chiet points in relation to the posterior primary divisions, leaving the first cervical and sacral nerves for subsequent exammation. 1. All the posterior primary divisions of the cervical (except the first), the thoracic and lumbar nerves divide into external and internal branches, which embrace the longissimus dorsi in the trunk and the complexus in the neck. Below the fifth cervical the semispinalis is also re- ceived into the fork. 2. Both external and internal branches are muscular, although only one of them is cutaneous. 3. In the upper half of the body (as low as the sixth thoracic) the internal branches supply the skin. 4. In the lower half of the body (below the sixth thoracic) the external branches supply the skin. 5. The lower three cervical and lower two lumbar nerves give off no posterior cutaneous branches as a rule. Superficial to the semispinalis, which ends abruptly at the spine of the axis, the profunda cervicis artery [A. cervicalis profunda] will be found running up to anastomose with the deep branch of the arteria princeps cervicis of the occipital already mentioned. It is a branch of the superior inter- costal, itself a branch of the subclavian, and it passes back above the neck of the first rib and below the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, having the multi- fidus and semispinalis colli internal to it and the scalenus medius external. SUBOCCIPITAL TRIANGLE Localise the spine of the axis where the semispinalis colli ends, and also the transverse process of the atlas about 2 inches external to, and a little above, it.

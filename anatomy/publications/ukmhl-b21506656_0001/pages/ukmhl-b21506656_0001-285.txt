265 THE MIDDLE EAR and stapes, Tvliicli form a chain across the tympanum from the tympanic membrane to the fenestra ovalis. In the trans- verse section through the two meatus the malleus is often displaced, but in the antero-posterior section the malleus and incus are hardly ever disturbed in the outer half of the section, while the stapes remains engaged in the fenestra ovalis in the inner half, j The Tncdleus (see Fig. 116, p. 257) has a knob-like head [capitulum mallei], which lies in the attic above the level of the membrana tympani; behind this it has a facet for articu- lation with the incus. The neck [collum mallei] lies on a level with the top of the membrane, and is continued into the handle [manubrium mallei], which runs downwards and a little backwards to the umbo. From the outer side of the neck the short process [p. lateralis] projects, and, as has been seen, presses against the lower part of the membrana flaccida. The long or slender process [p. anterior] is a delicate spicule of bone which projects into the Glaserian fissure from the front of the neck. The incus lies behind the malleus, and is often likened to a molar tooth. The simile may be heightened by likening it to a lower milk molar, on account of the great splay of its two fangs. The body, which represents the crown of the tooth, has a deeply-notched articular surface which looks forwards to articulate with the facet on the back of the head of the malleus. The long process [crus longum] represents the anterior fang of the tooth, and runs down parallel with the handle of the malleus, but on a plane behind and internal to it (see Fig. 116, p. 257). . Between these two processes the chorda tympani nerve T passes. At its tip the long process of the incus turns inwards a 1 little and ends in a small rounded knob, the os orhicidare, 1 where it articulates with the stapes. The shoH process [crus breve] is conical and more massive

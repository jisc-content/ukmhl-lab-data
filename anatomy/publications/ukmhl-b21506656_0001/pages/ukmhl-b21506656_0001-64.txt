PBACTICAL ANATOMY 44 trunks join to form the outer cord of the plexus, that of the lower trunk becomes the inner cord, while the posterior secondary divisions of all three trunks unite to form the 'posterior cord. It is usual to speak of upper and lower trunks and inner and outer cords, because the plexus is gradu- ally curving downwards to reach the axilla. The level of the clavicle corresponds roughly to the Fig. 20.--DiAGRAir of Brachial Plexus to .show the Different Parts. 5, 6, 7, 8.

All the branches of this plexus, as of the others, are anterior (ventral) or posterior (dorsal), and this is the. case even when they come off* before the anterior and posterior secondary divisions separate. (In Fig. 21 all the dorsal branches are black.)

THE BRAIN 289 The external root [stria olfactoria lateralis] runs across the apex of the island of Reil towards the uncus. The internal root [s.o. medialis] turns inwards on to the medial surface of the brain, where it becomes continuous with the callosal convolution. The middle root [s.o. intermedia], which is only faintly marked, passes backward to the region of the anterior 'per- forated space [substantia perforata anterior], which is the floor of the triangle enclosed between the outer and inner roots. The anterior perforated space is continuous externally with the apex of the island of Reil (limen insulce), and its perforations transmit numerous arteries and veins, which will be noticed later, to the interior of the brain. The Optic Commissure or Chiasma lies just behind the level of the anterior perforated spaces of the two sides. Running forwards from it on each side are the two cut optic nerves, while running back on each side are the two optic tracts which disappear under cover of the uncus, a structure better studied on the medial surface of the cerebrum. Draw back the optic commissure gently and notice a very thin layer of non-nervous tissue called the lamina cinerea [1. terminalis]; it is so delicate that it is easily torn through, and then the cavity of the third ventricle is exposed. Just behind the optic commissure is the tuber cinereum, an ovoid, dark-coloured swelling, with its long axis trans- verse. From its inverted summit the infundibulum or stalk of the pituitary body descends. The Pituitary Body [hypophysis cerebri], removed from its fossa and preserved with the rest of the brain, should now be examined. The large anterior part is glandular and is disproportion- ately large in giants. It is originally derived from the nasal mucous membrane (stomodfieum), and therefore has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the brain. VOL. I. T

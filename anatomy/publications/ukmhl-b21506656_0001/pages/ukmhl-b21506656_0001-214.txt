PRACTICAL ANATOMY 194 downwards and forwards in this part is tlie naso-palatine artery, which runs from the spheno-palatine foramen to the anterior palatine canal. Here, as in all other parts of the dissection of the head, a skull should be at hand for refer- ence. This artery is deep to the mucous membrane, but, if it is well injected, often shows through. In the floor of the nasal fossa, just abovQ the anterior palatine canal, a little depression in the mucous membrane should be looked for, while just above this, on the septal wall, a minute slit-like orifice is occasionally to be found in the adult, uito which a seeker may be pushed upwards and backwards for a httle distance. This sht, which represents the opening into the degenerated organ of Jacohson, can always be found in the foetus. Dissect the mucous membrane off the septum and look for the naso-palatine artery [A. spheno-palatina], and, ac- companying it, the naso-palatine nerve [N. naso-palatinus], a branch of Meckel's ganglion. As this nerve comes through the spheno-palatine foramen, it should be picked up on the upper and back part of the septum. In dissecting the mucous membrane off the upper third of the septum, twigs of the olfactory nerves should be carefully looked for, while quite anteriorly the internal branch of the nasal nerve [N. ethmoidahs anterior] runs down and gives off sensory filaments as far as the anterior nares. The deviation of the septum to one side, if it is present, should be carefully noted, because on a casual inspection of one nostril it may be mistaken for a tumour. Now look at the other side of the section, which shows the outer wall and most of the roof and floor of the nasal This shows the turbinated bones, each of which overhangs a space called a meatus. Three turbinated bones are usually described, though m most specimens there are really four. The inferior tur- binated hone [concha nasahs inferior] is the largest, and

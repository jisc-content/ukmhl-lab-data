GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING valuable, as a good edge is so quickly obtained; but, what- ever be used, the knife must be kept quite flat and the atten- tion concentrated on getting the point and its neighbouring part sharp. One or two knives in each case must be kept sharp all along the blade for removing the skin. In doing this try to plan the incisions in such a way as to give as large a flap as possible. The reason for this is that small flaps shrink so much, and there is no covering which preserves a dissection as well as its own skin. Make the skin incisions boldly and cleanly, watching carefully the thickness of the skin and noticing the first sign of subcutaneous fat. As soon as this is seen the incision is deep enough. In reflecting the skin pick up an angle of the flap with good broad-pomted forceps, and do not attempt to use the delicate pointed instruments with which earth-worms were dissected. Raise the flap with even sweeps, always keeping a steady traction upon it with the left hand; indeed, when once enough of the flap is raised to grasp with the fingers, the forceps may be discarded with advantage. Keep the knife close to the skin, but try not to buttonhole it; the most superficial layer of the fat is where the knife-edge should be. Notice carefully the thickness of the skin in different regions of the body; the knowledge will be very valuable afterwarls in operating. Never injure the epidermis in any way, since, wherever it is denuded, the skin will dry up in spite of any artificial cove ing. Scissors are occasionally, though hot very often, used in dissecting. Two pairs are a great advantage in a case, one fine and one coarse. The coarse pair should have very strong short blades and long strong handles; they wiU then cut through thin plates of bone with great ease. Hooks for holding things out of the way are never

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 88 facial vein leaves the face, one or two lymphatic nodes [lyraphoglandulae submaxillares] should be looked for at once (see Fig. 42, S.M.N.). The whole plan of the artificial subdivision of the anterior triangle is now plain. The LOWER or Muscular Triangle (Fig. 43, M.T.) has been seen; the middle or Carotid Triangle (C.T.) is bounded by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid below, the sterno-mastoid behind, and the posterior belly of the digastric above, while the upper or Submaxillary Triangle (S.M.T.) is marked out by a line drawn along the posterior belly of the digastric and continued along the hyoid bone to the mid line of the neck—this is the lower boundary— then along the mid line of the neck to the chin for the anterior limit, and above by the lower margin of the jaw and a Une drawn back from its angle to the sterno-mastoid. As the most important structures in the neck, from an anatomical point of view, are the Carotid Arteries [A. carotis], their branches and relations, a careful dissection of these from below upwards will lead to a good working knowledge of this region. The line of the common and external carotid arteries in the undissected body is one drawn from the sterno-clavicular joint to the angle of the jaw. As far as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, the line corresponds to the common carotid artery; above that to the external carotid. The line for the internal carotid is a Httle posterior or external to that for the external carotid. The plan advised for the study of the third part of the subclavian artery (see p. 39) should be adopted here, and the following relations looked for and verified.

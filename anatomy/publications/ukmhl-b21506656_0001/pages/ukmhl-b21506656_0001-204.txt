184 PEACTICAL ANATOMY Between the middle and inferior constrictors the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal artery pass on their way to the larynx, while below the inferior constrictor the recurrent laryngeal nerve is seen running up, giving a few twigs to that muscle, and being accompanied by the inferior laryngeal branches of the inferior thyroid artery (see Fig. 89). Now make a median vertical incision right down the posterior median raphe of the pharynx, from the skull to the level of the cricoid cartilage; remove the packing and wash out the cavity. On turning aside the flaps the anterior wall of the interior of the pharynx is seen. In the upper part this is wanting, since here the naso-pharynx, as the cavity above the soft palate is called, is continuous with the nasal fossae through the posterior nares or choance, and the back of the septum, formed by the vomer covered by mucous membrane, is seen in the distance. Below this is the soft palate hanging down from the horizontal processes of the palate bones, and lying against the posterior surface of the tongue. In the mid line the soft palate is prolonged down into the conical uvula. Below the soft palate is the oral pharynx, the anterior wall of which is formed by the posterior surface of the tongue. Lift up the uvula and look for the foramen caecum, a small pit into which a seeker may be pushed for an eighth to a quarter of an inch. This is in the mid line of the tongue, at the junction of its superior and posterior surfaces, and marks the upper end of the thyro-glossal duct of the foetus from which the isthmus and part of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland were developed. On each side of the foramen cascum a slight groove runs forwards and outwards, known as the sulcus terminalis, indi- cating the separation betAveen the pharyngeal and oral parts of the tongue, which are developed separately.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 180 between tliese ttiree cuts "will separate the anterior from the posterior piece of the skull. The hypoglossal nerve must be divided external to the anterior condylar foramen if the chisel has not already divided it, while the common carotid arteries should be cut about the level of the cricoid cartilage. The dissector has already been advised to cut the internal jugular vein. Now wrap up and put away the posterior fragment, and fill the pharynx in the anterior one with tow or cotton wool soaked in spirit. This may be done from the mouth, but if there is any difficulty make a small vertical incision in the mid line behind to be sewn up when the packing is done. It should be realised that this proceeding, though it makes the pharyngeal walls more easy to study, quite alters the appearance and relations of the natural pharynx, the lower part of which is a transverse slit with anterior and posterior walls and lateral borders. The pharynx, when padded out, is now seen to be a muscular tube, the walls of which are formed by the three constrictors fitting into and overlapping one another hke three flower-pots. The superior constrictor rises from the lower part of the internal pterygoid plate, and from the pterygo-mandibular ligament. If the lower jaw had not been cut away it would also be found rising from the mylo-hyoid ridge opposite the last molar tooth (see Fig. 89). Where it is rising from the ligament its fibres are almost continuous with those of the buccinator, which are running forward from nearly the same place. In cleaning the surface of the muscle the loose cellular tissue which covers it—and, if the pharynx had not been artificially distended, would be largely behmd it—will be found to have collapsed into an artificial plane known as the hiicco-pharyngeal membrane. In this cellular tissue lies the pharyngeal plexus of veins, continuous anteriorly with the

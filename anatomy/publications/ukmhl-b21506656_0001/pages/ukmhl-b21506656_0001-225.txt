205 THE ORBIT through the eyelid in the living person, though this is more difficult in the formcalm-hardened dead body. After leaving the pulley the tendon turns backwards, outwards, and downwards to reach the outer and back part of the upper hemisphere of the eyeball, so that, when acting, it pulls the back of the eye upwards and inwards and makes the front look downwards and outwards. It will be seen that the superior oblique passes below the superior rectus; indeed, its insertion could not have been seen unless the rectus had previously been cut. It is not at all difficult to expose the pulley and a good deal of the tendon of the superior oblique from the front by dividing the palpebral ligament. This should be tried on the right side. The external rectus [M. rectus lateralis] should be examined on the left orbit; it is remarkable for rising by two heads, one on each side of the anterior lacerated foramen. Between them the following structures pass from above downwards: (1) Upper division of oculo-motor nerve; (2) nasal branch of Fifth; (3) lower division of oculo-motor nerve; (4) Abducens (6th) nerve; (5) Ophthalmic vein (see Fig. 99). As the muscle passes forwards to be inserted a little behind the sclero-corneal junction it should be examined very carefully, when it will be seen to be surrounded by a slight sheath of cellular tissue a little more delicate in texture than the surrounding fat-containing tissue. This sheath can be made into a quite definite sleeve by a little careful dissection, and on approaching the eyeball it will be seen that it too is enclosed in a similar casing of delicate cellular tissue, forming a lymph space. This is known as the Capsule of Tenon [fascia bulbi], and may be traced forwards as far as the fornix of the conjunctiva and backwards as far as the optic nerve. From the outer and front part of the muscular sleeve on the external rectus some fairly dense fibres run outwards to the

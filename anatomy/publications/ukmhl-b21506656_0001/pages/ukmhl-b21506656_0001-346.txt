PRACTICAL ANATOMY 326 above the corpora quadrigemina, through the great trans- verse fissure as far forward as the foramen of Monro. It will also be easily understood that the veins in the choroid plexuses are between the two layers of the tela chorioidea, and so really outside the pia mater. When the development of the brain is studied, it will be seen that the double layer of the tela chorioidea is really due to the backward growth of the cerebral hemispheres. It must also be realised that the choroid plexuses are covered by the delicate ciliated lining membrane or epen- dyma of the ventricles. All that part of the lateral ventricle in front of the foramen of Monro is known as the anterior horn, and the roof of this should be removed after carefully exploring the cavity with some very blunt implement. It will be found that the anterior horn runs downwards and outwards as well as forwards, and is compressed from side to side (see Fig. 150, p. 338). Its passage into the body of the ventricle is so gradual that, were it not for the foramen of Monro, it would be impossible to say where the anterior cornu began. Notice that the two anterior horns are separated by a very thin partition, the septum lucidum or pellucidum, which has already been seen in the medial section (see p. 306). This is still attached to a strip of the corpus callosum, which may now be cut away," and, in dividing the septum lucidum to do so, it will be seen that the latter consists of two layers enclosing the slit-like fifth ventricle between them (see Fig. 144). This Fifth Ventricle [cavum septi pellucidi] should be explored with a seeker, when it will be found to have no out- let whatever, and therefore cannot contain cerebro-spinal fluid like the other ventricles, since there is no point of entry for it. Moreover, the space is not lined with ependyma as are the other ventricles.

41 THE NECK care, since they are met with in the operation for ligature of the third part of the subclavian artery. In recomisine them it will be noticed that the cervical fascia is merely condensed cellular tissue, and not a fibrous sheet unless it is artificially made into one by dissection. The suprascapular artery [A. transversa scapula?] is on its way outwards from the thyroid axis, and lies just behmd the clavicle, to which it gives sometimes one, sometimes two, nutrient branches. The artery may be followed outwards and backwards through the cellular tissue deep to the tra- pezius, accompanying the suprascapular nerve and posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle to the notch in the upper border of the scapula. The external jugular vein passes down on its way to the subclavian vein, but the latter is not seen, since it lies altogether below the level of its artery and quite behind the clavicle. The transversalis colli and suprascapular veins open into the outer side of the external jugular vein, but their position is not very constant. The anterior jugular vein [V. jugularis anterior] should be sought coming from under cover of the sterno-mastoid and opening into the inner side of the external jugular close to its termination. These veins are of special importance in the living body, because, if cut, there is danger of air being sucked into themâ€”a very dangerous accident. The nerve to the suhclavius is very small, and runs down quite close to the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid; it passes behind the clavicle to enter the deep surface of the suh- clavius. The supraclavicular lymph nodes are fairly large and numerous; they receive vessels coming up from the axilla and shoulder region as well as those from the posterior triangle.

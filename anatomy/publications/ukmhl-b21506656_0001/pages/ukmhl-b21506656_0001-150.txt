130 PRACTICAL ANATOMY enter its deep surface in front of the root of the zygoma; they should be reflected leaving a small portion of muscle attached. When this has been done the temporal muscle can be reflected still farther, and, just above the ex- ternal auditory meatus, the middle temporal artery, which is very constant, will be seen running upwards, supplying the back part of the muscle with blood. In turning up the front part of the muscle, the Httle temporal branch of the temporo- malar nerve may be traced to its foramen in the malar bone. Finally, the whole temporal muscle should be shaved off the skull, and its exact origin noticed. PTERYGOID REGION The neck of the condyle must be carefully cut through with the Hey's saw and bone forceps, remembering that the internal maxillary artery lies deep to it (Fig. 61, Cut D). Then the ramus of the jaw should be divided horizontally above the level of the inferior dental foramen, which is situated midway between the sigmoid notch and the lower margin of the jaw; the cut should therefore be a little above this level: if the section is made too low, the inferior dental nerve will be divided (Fig. 61, Cut E). It is better to cut partly through the bone with the saw and to finish with the forceps, keeping the flat side of the blades towards the part which is to be saved. As an extra precaution the handle of a scalpel may be pushed forwards deep to the bone and the cut made on to that. When the piece of bone is lifted out, the inferior dental nerve [N. alveolaris inferior] should be looked for, entering the foramen near the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the ramus, and, if another horizontal strip of the jaw can be taken away without damaging the nerve, it should be done, as every fraction of space gained makes the later dissection easier.

NASAL FOSS^ 199 The middle part, when the mucous membrane is partly dragged away, shows the cribriform plate of the ethmoid with^the olfactory nerves coming through, though these are so soft that it is difficult to demonstrate them satis- factorily. The nasal nerve should be traced up to the small foramen in front of the nasal slit, where it was left in the dissection of the cranial fossa (see Fig. 96). A few twigs of the anterior ethmoidal artery generally accompany it. Put the two halves of the nasal cavity together and examine the posterior nares or choance, which have some- times to be plugged for persistent bleeding from the nose. Each is about inch high and | inch broad. Cut away the outer surface of the maxilla on one side, thus exposing the cavity of the antrum, and notice the relative positions of the nasal cavities, the ethmoidal cells, the orbit, and the maxillary antrum. The maxillary antrum [sinus maxillaris] may now be explored, and the thinness of the plate of bone which separates it from the orbit tested by making a small per- foration through it. Its floor is narrower than its roof, and the fangs of the first or second molar teeth often just project into it. In the front of the antrum the infraorbital canal is seen projecting, with the canal for the anterior superior dental nerve running down from it. At the upper and inner angle the ethmoidal cells are only separated by a paper-like plate of bone from the antrum. Pass a seeker back along the roof of the nose, and notice how little space there is between the superior turbinated bone and the septum. THE ORBIT In dissecting the orbit it is advisable for the dissectors of the two sides to agree to work together. If this is done a very complete exposure of the cavity may be made on one

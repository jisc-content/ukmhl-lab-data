The Facial Artery and Vein [A. et V. maxillaris externa] have been met with often in the dissection, and should now be cleaned and finally examined as far as then- facial course is concerned. The vein is the more superficial, and begins at the inner angle of the orbit, where it communi- cates with the frontal and other tributaries of the ophthal-

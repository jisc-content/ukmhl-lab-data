266 PRACTICAL- ANATOMY than the long one; it passes horizontally backwards to the lower part of the aditus. It will be noticed that both the body and short process are in the attic. Now disarticulate the incus and malleus in the longi- tudinal section (left side), and notice that the short process of the former is attached to the margin of the aditus by the posterior ligament of the incus, while a delicate capsule attaches it to the malleus. In disarticulating the malleus its head will be found suspended from the tegmen tympani by the superior liga- ment, the posterior fibres of which run nearly horizontally backwards external to the body of the incus. An anterior ligament passes forwards from the root of the slender process into the Glaserian fissure, while the handle is attached to the tympanic membrane along the whole length of its outer border. . The insertion of the tensor-tympani tendon mto the base of the handle has already been noticed. The stapes will be found on the inner half of the longi- tudinal section, while in the transverse section both it and the incus often retain their relative positions. Its likeness to a stirrup laid upon its side is very striking, and it consists ot a head [capitulum stapedis], which articulates with the os orbiculare of the incus ; a nech, into which the tendon of the stapedius is inserted behind; an anterior andposimo7' cms, of which the latter is longer and more curved than the former; and a footplate [basis stapedis], Avhich fits into the fenestra ovaHs, and, like that opening, is kidney-shaped, the more convex border of the kidney being uppermost (see ^'^It^lhouldte gently disengaged from the fenestra, to the margins of which it is attached by the annular hgament If these points have been carefully verified, there will ho no difficulty in placing any of the three ossicles m their proper positions, or in telling to which side they belong.

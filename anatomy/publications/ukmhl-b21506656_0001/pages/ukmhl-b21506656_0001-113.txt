93 THE NECK The writer's experience makes him wish that the cervical fascia could be described merely as cellular tissue packing in all the interstices of the neck, and tending to become slightly less dense where movement is most free, and he cannot find that there is any justification, from a clinical point of view, in burdening the student's memory with the usual academic description of the cervical fascia. Having identified all the other relations, they may be cleaned and systematically examined. Leaving the clavicle and sterno-clavicular joint for examination at another time, the first important structure is the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. Its strong but small tendinous origin from the upper part of the front of the manubrium sterni has been seen in Burns' space, while its origin from the inner third of the upper surface of the clavicle can be easily made out by clean- ing away the "deep cervical fascia" covering the muscle. The insertion into the mastoid process and outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone can be followed, and it will be seen that those fibres which rise from the sternum are inserted most superficially. While cleaning the surface of the muscle the external jugular vein can be followed up to its formation by the posterior auricular join- ing the posterior division of the temporo-maxillary veins, though it is liable to a good deal of variation. The great auricular and transverse cervical nerves, already partly dis- sected, may now be exposed in their whole course, and it will be seen that the former supplies the skin of the lower part of the ear as well as of an area just in front and behind it, while the transverse cervical is the cutaneous nerve of the whole of the side of the neck. The entrance of the spinal accessory nerve into the sterno-mastoid is deep to the anterior border of the muscle and about the level of the angle of the jaw. It is not, however, advisable to cut the sterno-mastoid yet. The Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-tliyroid muscles are only in front of the carotid artery in the lower part of the neck, and as the sterno-thyroid is the deeper of the two, it is by far

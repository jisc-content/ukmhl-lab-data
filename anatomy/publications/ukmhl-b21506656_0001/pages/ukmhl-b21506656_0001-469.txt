LIGAMENTS OF THE SOLE 449 the foot it will be seen that the weight is transmitted to the astragalus, which is supported on a tripod. The posterior Hmb is the calcaneum, the antero-internal limb the heads of the three inner metatarsals, the antero-external limb the two outer metatarsals. Three arches are present in such a tripod, an inner and outer longitudinal and a transverse The inner longitudinal arch is the most important; in it the calcaneum is the posterior pier, the astragalus the key- stone and the navicular, three cuneiforms and three inner metatarsals the anterior pier. The inferior calcaneo' nuvicular ligament acts as a "tyer" to this arch, joining the two piers just below the keystone and also supporting the keystone. The obliquity of the astragalus transmits the weight of the body to the anterior pier of this arch, and the number of segments in this pier, in addition to the presence of the elastic spring ligament, serve to break the shock of a jump provided the jumper has the sense to alight as much as possible on the ball of the big toe. The outer longitudinal arch is simpler and has the cal- caneum for its posterior pier, while the anterior pier is formed by the cuboid and two outer metatarsals. The two long and short plantar ligaments act as "tyers" to this arch. It does not play as important a part as the inner arch, because the toes are turned out. The transverse arch is best seen by making a section through the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid, when it will be noticed that its dorsal convexity is maintained chiefly by the strong interosseous ligaments which bind these bones together. A good deal of the shock of a jump on to the toes is expended in splaymg out this arch as far as the ligaments will allow. VOL. I. 2f

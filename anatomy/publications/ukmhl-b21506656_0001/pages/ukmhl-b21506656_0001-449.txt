429 THE KNEE-JOINT Before leaving this region notice the great vahie of the susieiUaculum tali as a landmark on the inner side of the foot. It cannot easily be felt through the skin, but it will be seen to lie one inch directly below the tip of the internal malleolus. Three tendons pass in close relation to it—the tibialis posticus above, the flexor longus digitorum internal (superficial), and the flexor longus hallucis below (see Fig. 178). THE JOINTS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY i The Knee-joint Recognise carefully all the muscles and tendons in relation with the joint, and work out the movements which each would produce in the joint if pulled. Review the various bursce about the knee, many of which have been seen already. They are :— 1. The pre-patellar bursa (sometiines there are two of these, superficial and deep) (see Fig. 184, p. 435). 2. The infra-patellar bursa, which lies behind the liga- mcntum patellae. To see it, make a vertical incision through the ligament for its whole length, and turn the edges aside; this will expose a bursal space reaching as high as the upper level of the tibia, which, when explored with a seeker, will be found to be quite separate from the knee-joint (Fig. 184). 3. The swpra-patellar bursa. This is the upward continu- ation of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint for about an inch and a half above the top of the patella. It was noticed on a former occasion, when the quadriceps extensor tendon was reflected. 4. The semi-membranosus bursa. This was noticed to be common to the semi-membranosus and inner head of the gastrocnemius. Its possible communication with the joint 1 The dissection of the hip-joint will be found on p. 389.

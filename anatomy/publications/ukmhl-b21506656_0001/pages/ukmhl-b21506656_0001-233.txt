THE EYE 213 Divide the optic nerve, close to tlie eyeball, through the anterior orbital aperture; this is best done with curved scissors, and then the left eye can be removed for future examination. THE EYE In subjects injected with formalin the eyeball, although sometimes rather collapsed, is quite useful for examination, but its anatomy can always be more easily followed if three or four fresh bullocks' eyes are ordered from the nearest slaughter-house. It is altogether undesirable to study the eyes of any other mammal without at least one human eye for reference, because it is so important to have a clear idea of the relative size of the different parts in man. Taking one of the human eyes already removed, notice that it is a sphere of practically an inch in diameter in every direction (a small fraction longer antero-posteriorly), and that anteriorly the cornea or transparent part bulges for- wards slightly. Posteriorly the optic nerve joins the sphere internal to and a trifle below the point at which the antero- posterior axis would emerge. Forming a ring round the entrance of the optic nerve are the points of entry of the long and short ciliary arteries and nerves, while the veins {venoe vorticosoe) come out in four or five places a little behind the equator or vertical transverse (coronal) section, midway between the anterior and posterior poles of the eye. : Look at the cut end of the optic nerve, and notice that it has a very thick fibrous sheath, which with care may be separated a little from the true nerve tissue within it, since there is a small lymph space between. This separation is more easily made out by splitting the nerve a little in a longitudinal direction. It is not at all easy to tell which eye IS being looked at unless the tendons of the two oblique miiscU-s are left fairly long; if they are cut very short re member that they are attached fairly close together on'the

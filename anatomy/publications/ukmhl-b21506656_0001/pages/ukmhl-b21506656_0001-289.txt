THE INTEENAL EAR 269 it should be divided in the long axis of the petrous bone, as well as transversely. To divide it longitudinally the inner haK of the left bone in which the longitudinal section of the I tympanum was made should have another section taken parallel to the former one, and just on the medial side of the inner wall of the tympanum. This section lies about a quarter I of an inch in front of the upper border of the petrous bone. When the dissector realises that he Avants to open up a very small space which hes just on the inner side of the fenestra ovalis, he will be able to adapt his saw-cut to the piece of bone- with which he is deahng. The writer has obtained his best results with a fret-saw and vice. If the two halves are looked at, the vestibule will be seen to be a conical space with its base directed outwards, and separated by a thin partition of bone from the posterior half of the tympanum, while its apex points backwards and inwards (see Fig. 121). If the posterior half of the right temporal bone, in which the transverse section between the two meatus was made, is taken, another section may be cut with a fret-saw, passing through the fenestra ovalis and running backwards and out- wards, which will divide the cavity into anterior and posterior halves. In the base, which is best studied on the left side, the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda are seen, while at its apex is the common opening of the superior and posterior semicircular canals. The bony vestibule contains two membranous bags, which, however, cannot be satisfactorily demonstrated by macro- scopic sections; the anterior of these is the saccule, the pos- [, terior the utricle. The saccule lies in a little depression known as the fovea hemispherica [recessus sphasricus], on the anterior wall of the vestibule, and as near the bottom of the internal auditory meatus as the vestibule reaches. Into this fovea opens the area cribrosa media, which con-

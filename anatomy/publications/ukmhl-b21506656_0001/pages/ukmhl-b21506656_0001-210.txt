PRACTICAL ANATOMY 190 and runs back from the posterior nasal spine into the uvnla, lying so close to its fellow of the opposite side that it was at one time looked upon as a single medial muscle, and so acquired its name. It is this muscle which is seen in the sagittal section already made. Put a hook through the base of the uvula and draAV the D soft palate downwards, making it as tense as possible.

In doing this the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube is laid bare, and it will be^ seen how rapidly the tube enlarges as it approaches the pharynx. Notice, too, how much better the cartilage is developed on the inner than on the outer side. It will be reahsed that the sinus of Morgagni is now being approached from the inner side, and the three structures which pass through from the outer side must be looked for on this

327 THE BRAIN The fifth ventricle therefore is clearly no part of the ventricular system of the brain, in spite of its name, and modern anatomists are trying to emphasise this fact by calling it the cavum septi pellucidi. The outer surface of the anterior horn of each lateral ventricle is formed by the bulging head of the caudate nucleus of the corpus striatum, which is generally crossed by a vein running towards the foramen of Monro. As the body of the ventricle is reached, the caudate nucleus rapidly narrows, until by the time it comes to the descending horn it is only a thin tail. As it is seen lying in the anterior horn and body of the lateral ventricle, the caudate nucleus looks like the quadrant of a pear with the stalk directed backwards. Internal to the caudate nucleus is the convex outline of the optic thalamus, but this only forms a part of the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle, and so is altogether behind the foramen of Monro. Between the optic thalamus and caudate nucleus runs a thin, strap-like, white band, known as th.Q . toenia semi- circularis [stria terminalis], which anteriorly passes down below the foramen of Monro to join, at least in part, the anterior pillar of the fornix, while posteriorly the strand is seen dipping down into the descending horn with the tail of the caudate nucleus. In close relation to the taenia semicircularis is the vein of the corpus striatum (vena terminalis), which runs down to the region of the foramen of Monro, where it receives the vein, already noticed, from the head of the caudate nucleus and another one from the septum lucidum, close to the anterior part of the choroid plexus, which here communi- cates with its fellow of the opposite side and forms the roof of the foramen. From this point the blood is carried back by the vein^ of Galen [vv. cerebri mternse], which lie side by side between the layers of the tela chorioidea (see Fig. 144) and therefore

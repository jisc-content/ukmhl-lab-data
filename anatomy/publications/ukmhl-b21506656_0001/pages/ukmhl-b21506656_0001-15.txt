GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING at a moment's notice in any part of it; hence a working knowledge of the whole body must be gained. How to provide it in the limited time at the student's disposal is the problem which Anatomy teachers have to solve. The more experienced examiners are now laying less stress on a knowledge of the exact attachment of every muscle and the course and ramifications of the smaller arteries, but they are demanding that the student should be able to find quickly and surely all the important struc- tures of the body and should be able to recognise them when they are only partly exposed. This means that the main geography or topography of the body must be carefully studied and no chance missed of looking at a dissection, whether it be the student's own or another's. Let a due sense of proportion always be observed; the big things are usually the most important. Get a good know- ledge of where these are to be met, and the smaller things will follow in due course. In every class of students a certain number will not be content with finding out where things are and what they are like; they will want to know why they are so. This will lead them into the fascinating and highly contentious study of morphology, though, accurately speak- mg, this term is misleading, and simply means a study of form. It is with real sorrow that the authors feel bound to advise medical students not to give up much time to this delightful study. They cannot do justice to it in the short time which is allowed for human anatomy in the ordinary curriculum, and are only likely to come to the ground between the two stools of topography and morpho- logy. Human morphology is not essential to a medical education, though it may be taken up with advantage later on as an honours subject. *

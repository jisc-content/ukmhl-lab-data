PRACTICAL ANATOMY 368 magnus "—through which the femoral artery enters the pop- liteal space to become the popliteal artery, and the popHteal vein leaves the space (see Fig. 160). The inner border of the adductor magnus passes downwards and outwards from the tuber ischii to the adductor tubercle. The attachment of the adductor magnus to the back of the femur and linea aspera is interrupted at four points for the passage through the muscle of the four 'perforating arteries and correspond- ing veins. These vessels lie directly upon the bone, and are preserved by tendinous arches from compression by the muscular fibres. The fact that they He upon the bone pre- vents them from being mistaken for purely muscular twigs of variable position and importance. The four perforating arteries are not always found. Sometimes only one or two are present. The buttock, back of thigh, and popliteal space should now be painted over with vaseline or with carbolic acid and glycerine, the skin replaced and stitched in position. In this way the parts will be preserved for future reference. THE FRONT OF THE THIGH Superficial ^Tiatom^/.—Identify by touch the spine of the pubis and the anterior superior iUac spine. Stretching between them a more or less distinct fibrous cord, shghtly convex downwards, may be felt-the ligament of Poupart [lig. inguinale], which on this aspect is taken as the dividing line between the abdomen and thigh. • The spine of the pubis is a most important landmark m the diagnosis of hernia; it is not always easily felt, particu- larly in the male, because the spermatic cord hes directly m front of it. . . - . r n A useful means of determining its position is to follow up the tendon of the adductor longus, always easily felt, to its attachment, or else to invaginate the scrotuni from behmd until the external abdominal ring in the abdommal wall is

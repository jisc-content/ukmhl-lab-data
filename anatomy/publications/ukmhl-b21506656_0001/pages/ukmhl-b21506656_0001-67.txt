THE SCALP 47 B. Latehal Landmarks (symmetrical) 1. Supraorhital margin [margo - supraorbitalis].—Just below the eyebrow, with the supraorhital notch [incisura supraorbitalis] at the junction of the inner and middle thirds. Sometimes a foramen replaces the notch, which then cannot be felt. 2. External Angular Process.—Where the supraorbital margin joins the malar bone. The suture here may usually be felt through the skin. 3. Supraciliary Eminence [arcus superciliarisj.—A little above the eyebrow, better marked in the male, and situated in front of the frontal air sinus, which lies between the two tables of the frontal bone. 4. Frontal Eminence [tuber frontale].—About an inch above the supraciliary, usually more prominent in the female, and forming the greatest convexity of the forehead on each side. 5. Temp)oral Crest [linea temporalis].—Running upwards and then backwards from the external angular process. This can be traced for some little distance in the male, but less distinctly in the female. 6. Upper Border of Zygoma.—Confirmed, forwards and upwards into the posterior margin of the malar bone, and so to the external angular process. 7. Parietal Eminence [tuber parietale].—The point of greatest convexity of each parietal bone. 8. Mastoid Process [P. mastoideusj.—Behind the ear and larger in the male. The tip seldom reaches quite as low as the lowest point of the lobe of the ear. 9. Supramastoid CVes^.—Continuing the upper border of the zygoma back above the attachment of the pinna, and gradually turning upwards on to the parietal bone. A skull should be at hand for comparison in case of difficulty in identifying any of these points. Now make a median incision through the skin from the

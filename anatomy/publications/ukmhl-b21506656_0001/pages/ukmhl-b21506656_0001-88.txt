68 PRACTICAL ANATOMY identified winding round the outer side of the crus cerebri, just under cover of the edge of the tentorium (see Fig. 33). The free and attached edges of the tentorium in front of their crossing form two sides of a triangle, the base of which is a line joining the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. In the centre of this triangle, and a little external to the posterior chnoid process, is a point at which the oculo-motor or third cranial nerve pierces the dura mater. Trace this nerve back to the inner aspect of the cut crus cerebri of its own side, and look just below it for the superior cerebellar artery running backwards from the termination of the basilar artery. Now find the infundibulum once more, and notice that it disappears through a hole in the diaphragma sellce, a process of the dura mater which roofs over the pituitary fossa. It is desirable to leave this fossa undisturbed for the present. Lift up one of the optic nerves, and look for the ophthal- mic artery coming off the internal carotid and lying at first below and internal to the nerve, though soon gaining a posi- tion below and external, and so disappearing with the nerve through the optic foramen. The tentorium should now be turned back by cuttmg just behind its attachment to the petrous bone on each side, and also by dividing it from before backwards, close to the mid line. This exposes the upper surface of the cerebeUum, and the fourth nerve may now be traced round the outer sides of the crura cerebri, lying close to the superior cere- bellar arteries. . Cut these nerves with scissors, leaving a good piece m the cranium to identify them by. In the same way dmde the third nerves. Now draw the cut crura and pons gently backwards until the large trigeminal or fifth cranial nerves are seen running over the petrous bone just external to its apex. These should be cut, but all the cranial nerves reqmre

107 THE NECK branch riuis forwards to the chin region accompanying and lying superficial to the mylo-hyoid nerve (see Eig. 42, M.H.). The Occipital Artery [A. occipitalis] rises opposite the facial and runs backwards and upwards, crossing superficial to the hypoglossal nerve, Avhich loops round its lower border, and also superficial to the internal jugular vein, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves. It runs backwards and upwards along the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric, and ultimately disappears under cover of it (see Eig. 51). The posterior auricular and ascending pharyngeal branches of the external carotid can hardly be satisfactorily examined at present. The neck should noAv be left until the face and pterygoid regions have been dissected. It should be wrapped up with great care to prevent its drying up. Eirst a layer of cotton wool or tow soaked in a mixture of | spirit and J glycerine and water should be placed over the whole of the neck. This should be covered with an oiled cloth or mth gutta-percha tissue and firmly bandaged. THE FACE Superficial Landmarks The outline of the orbital and nasal apertures should be traced on the living face, the malar bone and zygomatic arch localised, and the condyle of the jaw felt for by slowly opening the mouth, when its movement is very evident. The infraorbital foramen can usually be made out a quarter of an inch below the infraorbital margin. It lies in a line which passes down from the supraorbital notch to the second bicuspid tooth, and this line, if prolonged doAvn, very nearly passes through the mental foramen. The mental foramen lies just internal to the vertical line described, and is about midway between the alveolar margin

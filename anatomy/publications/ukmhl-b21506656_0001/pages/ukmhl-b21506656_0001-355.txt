THE BRAIN 335 posteriorly are the two limbs of the internal capsule, while on the outer side the external capsule lies. The internal capsule is a most important region, since through it run the nerve paths which connect the motor and sensory areas on the surface of the brain with the crura •cerebri, medulla and spinal cord. The two limbs join at an angle opposite the apex of the lenticular nucleus, forming the genu, while of the two the anterior is only about half the length of the posterior. It will be noticed that the anterior limb separates the lenticular from the caudate nucleus, while the posterior separates the lenticular nucleus from the optic thalamus. In the substance of the internal capsule some of the ganglionic end arteries which enter the anterior perforated space are cut; the " artery of cerebral haemorrhage," referred to on p. 318, is said to supply the region just behind the genu in which the motor fibres from the precentral convolution are gathered in one bundle, so that haemorrhage from or occlusion of this artery, when it occurs, would produce paralysis of the opposite side of the body. Outside the lenticular nucleus and bounding its base is the narrow strip of white matter known as the external capsule, of much less physiological importance than the internal. It separates the lenticular nucleus from the claustriinn, a narrow streak of grey matter which forms the third nucleus of the corpus striatum, the other two being, of course, the caudate and lenticular nuclei. Outside it is another layer of white matter, and then the grey matter of the gyri of the insula. It will be noticed that the claustrum corresponds almost exactly to the extent of the insula. Other things to be looked for in this section are— 1. The bundle of Vicq d'Azyr, a small circular patch embedded in the optic thalamus, a little distance behind the anterior pillar of the fornix. 2.

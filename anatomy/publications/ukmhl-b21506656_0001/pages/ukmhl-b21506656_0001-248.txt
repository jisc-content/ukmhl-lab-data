228 PRACTICAL ANATOMY DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX When a fresh larynx can be obtained, as is often the case, it is preferable to the one on the student's own part, because by this time the latter is probably rather dry. If no fresh one is available, the larynx should be removed from the part just above the hyoid bone, taking care not to injure the epiglottis. First review the epiglottis, aryteno-epiglottidean folds, and arytenoid cartilages already seen in the dissection of the pharynx, and notice how these structures form the orifice of the larynx. Next look down into the laryngeal cavity, where the glottis or rima glottidis will be seen as a chink between the two trtbe vocal cords [ligamenta vocaha], which it is possible to widen or narrow, as the cords are separated or brought together. Notice that the term " glottis " only refers to this space, and should not be used for the whole larynx, as is sometimes done. On running a seeker along the edge of the true cords, it will be found that they are attached close together to the re-entering angle of the thyroid cartilage in front, while behind each is fastened to a slender process which projects forward for about a quarter of an inch from the base of the arytenoid cartilage to meet it. The tip of this vocal process may be made to approach or leave its fellow by turning the arytenoid cartilage on its vertical axis, and this is one movement which occurs during life; but, in addition, the arytenoids may be drawn bodily towards or away from one another along the top of the back of the cricoid cartilage. When the glottis is closed it is a mere antero-posterior line, but .when as much room as possible is required it becomes a lozenge-shaped space.

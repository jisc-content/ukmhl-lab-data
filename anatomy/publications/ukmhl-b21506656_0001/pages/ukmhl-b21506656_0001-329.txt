THE BRAIN" 309 commissure should be looked for. Above this is the pineal recess, which runs bcaekwards into the root of the pineal body, while still higher is the supra-pineal recess, lying between the pineal body and the spleniura in the great transverse fissure of the brain. The anterior wall of the third ventricle begins above at the foramen of Monro, where the roof of tela chorioidea ends; S.P. C.M.S. ^S.R.

The section of the pineal body should be carefully noticed, lyiiig just above the superior corpora quadrigemina and closely attached to the reflexion or apparent invagination of the tela chorioidea. With a little skill and patience the anterior pillar of the

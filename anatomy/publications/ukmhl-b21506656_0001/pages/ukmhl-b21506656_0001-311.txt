291 THE BRAIN" crura in removing the brain usually passes through the upper pair of these (Fig. 129, S.C.Q.). It will be noticed that the superior corpora quadrigemma [colhculi superiores] are larger than the inferior [cc. inferi- ores], and have the pineal body just above them, resting in the medial groove which separates the superior coUiculus of one side from that of the other. Each of the four colliculi has a brachium or ridge run- ning outwards from it. The external geniculate body, the upper quadrigeminal body, and the pulvinar are known collectively as the lower visual centres. A bundle of fibres, the inferior brachium, connects the internal geniculate with the lower quadrigeminal body, but these structures form part of the apparatus of hearing. Just external to the outer geniculate body is a narrow band called the tcenia semicircular is, which will be met with again. Now freshen the section through the crura cerebri by taking a thin slice off with a sharp knife, and notice that each consists of a ventral part, the crusta, which is quite dis- tinct from its fellow of the opposite side, and contains the motor nerve paths; and a dorsal part, the tegmentum, united to its fellow across the middle line, and containing the sensory nerve paths. The two parts of each crus are separated by a dark irregular band, the substantia nigra, while nearer the dorsal side a section of the aqueduct of Sylvius appears in the mid line looking like a capital T. Still more dorsally {i.e. pos- teriorly) either the superior or inferior pair of quadrigeminal bodies, probably the superior, will be cut through (see Fig. 129). Behind these the splenium, or hind end of the corpus callosum, will be seen when the membranes have been removed.

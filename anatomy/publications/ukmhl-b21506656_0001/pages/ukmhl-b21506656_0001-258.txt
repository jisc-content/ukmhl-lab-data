PRACTICAL ANATOMY 238 This cartilage never ossifies, because it is made of fibro- cartilage, instead of hyaHne, hke the thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoids, all of which ossify as a rule in middle life. The cornicula laryngis, or little cartilages, which project back on each side from the apices of the arytenoids, are made of fibro-cartilage, as are also the cuneiform cartilages already mentioned (p. 187), so that these too do not ossify. PREVERTEBRAL REGION A dissection has still to be made of that part of the neck and skull which was removed in order to see the pharynx from behind. It has been noticed that this part of the neck is naturally divided from the part in front by the dense mass of woolly cellular tissue which can so easily be converted into a thick sheet by artificial methods. Behind this tissue lie the prevertebral muscles, consisting of the longus colli, scalenus anticus, rectus capitis anticus major and minor. The longus colli consists of a vertical and two oblique parts. The vertical part is nearest the middle line, and rises from the bodies of the upper three thoracic and lower three cervical vertebrte. It is inserted into the front of the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae. The lower oblique part rises just external to the last from the bodies of the upper three thoracic vertebrae, and is in- serted into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, while the upper obhque part rises from the anterior tubercles of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical transverse processes, and is inserted into the tubercle in the mid-ventral line of the atlas. On their way these fibres groove the anterior surface of the body of the axis. In order to verify the lower part of the origin of the vertical and lower oblique parts, the thorax must be looked

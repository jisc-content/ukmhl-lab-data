96 PRACTICAL ANATOMY On dissecting it up it will be seen to come off the hypoglossal nerve where that structure is crossing superficial to the begimiing of the external carotid artery, just above the level of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. Below, about the level of the cricoid cartilage, it is joined by the ramus com- municans cervicis to form a loop, the Ansa Eypoglossi aut cervicis, from which branches are given off to the sterno- hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, all of which nerves have been seen already. It must be re- membered that although the descendens hypoglossi seems to â– be given off from the hypoglossal, it is really derived from the first cervical nerve, and is only bound up with the hypoglossal. The communicans cervicis, if followed up, will usuaUy be seen to pass between the carotid artery and internal jugular vein and, by separating these, the two branches which form' it may be traced to the second and third cervical nerves. Sometimes, however, the nerve passes superficial to the internal jugular vein (see Fig. 50). After dividing the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles the Thyeoid Gland [G. thyreoidea] should be exammed. It is one of the ductless glands, and has two lobes connected m front of the upper two or three tracheal rings by an isthmus. In 6leaning it be careful not to cut its arteries and vems. _ At the upper part of each lateral ]obe the superior thyroid artery enters, usually in three branches two anterior and one posterior, while at the lower and back par of each lobe several branches of the inferior thyroid artery "''occasionally a third artery, the ^^-^^^/^'^'us in front of the trachea to supply the region of the isthmus^ ond when this is present it is a dangerous obstacle m Lach otomy It is^e-Hy a branch of the innominate. tTc amsromosis across the isthmus - sometimes fairly free^ though usually there is little blood lost m a median section of this during life.

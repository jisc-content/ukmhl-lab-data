301 THE BRAIN from the cerebellum. Replace this, and draw the half of the cerebellum remaining to one side. This will show the diamond-shaped fourth ventricle, bounded above by the two superior cerebellar peduncles (Fig. 133). Below it is bounded by the restiform bodies or inferior cerebellar peduncles, which seem to the naked eye to be continuous with two bundles on each side ascending from the posterior surface of the spinal cord. The inner of these, continuous with the postero-medial columns (columns of Goll) in the cord, are known as the ftmiculi graciles; and when the lower apex of the fourth ventricle is reached, they swell up and form the clavce, diverging at the same time from one another to open up the floor of the ventricle. The outer of the two bundles on each side is continuous with the postero-lateral column of Burdach, and is called the funicuhts cuneatus; it too has a slight swelling known as the cuneate tubercle. The floor of the fourth ventricle is, as has been said, diamond-shaped, the upper angle bemg continuous with the aqueduct of Sylvius [aquiBductus cerebri], by means of which it communicates with the third ventricle, while the lower angle, from its likeness to a nib, is known as the calamus scriptorius. Running vertically down the mid line of the floor is the median sulcus through which the section has passed. Passing horizontally across the floor, from the middle of this groove to the lateral angles of the diamond, are strands of fibres known as the strice acusticce, belonging to the cochlear division of the auditory nerve, and, if these are followed outwards, they are seen to pass superficial to the restiform body. These strife divide the fourth ventricle into an upper and a lower triangle, and, on turning the specimen round, it will be seen that the upper triangle has the pons in front of it, while the lower has the medulla.

THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION 143 The relations of this gland are easily made out, and can be followed on oneself by a finger in the mouth. Ex- ternally would be the body of the mandible, which is now Upturned. Internally (deep) are the genio-hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual nerve, and Wharton's duct. These may be seen by turning the gland up. Above is the mucous membrane Fig. 69.â€”Diagrammatic Transverse Section of Tongue to SHOW THE Relations op the Sublingual Gland. R.A. Ranine Artery. I.L.

The upper edge of the almond-shaped gland pushes up the mucous membrane of the mouth into a ridge known as the plica sublingualis, and here its numerous ducts (some- times called ducts of Rivinus) [D.d. subhnguales rainores] open. When the gland is turned up the lingual nerve will be seen to give numerous twigs to it as well as to the mucous I membrane of the tongue, as far as its tip. Wharton's duct, which is thin-walled and easily torn, may

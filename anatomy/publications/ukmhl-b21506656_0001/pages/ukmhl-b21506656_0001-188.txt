168 PRACTICAL ANATOMY grey rami communicantes to the seventli and eightli cervical nerves, as "well as vasomotor twigs to tlie vertebral and internal mammary arteries, and an inferior cervical cardiac branch, which is sometimes fused with the middle cervical cardiac, to the deep cardiac plexus. The annulus of Vieussens, already noticed, communicates with this ganglion, but this loop is not always present and gives ofi no branches of any importance. Now that the first part of the subclavian artery is re- flected, its posterior relations in the neck may be studied. PosTEEiOR Relations of First Part of Subclavian Artery Bones.—Head and neck of first rib are quite half an inch away. Muscles.—Longus colli. Fibrous Structures.—Sibson's Fascia, covering the dome of the pleura. Arteries and Veins.—None. 2{erves.—Inferior Cervical and First Thoracic Ganglia of Sympathetic with most of the Cardiac Nerves. Recurrent Laryngeal on right side only. Glandular and other Structures.—Dome of Pleura. The next thing is to study the formation of the Cervical Plexus. This is formed by the upper four cervical nerves, each of which emerges from the spinal canal above its own vertebra, and not below as in the thoracic and lumbar regions. These four nerves are joined together by three communicating loops, the first of which passes in front of the transverse process of the atlas, while the lower two lie in front of the levator anguli scapulfB and scalenus medius. The most easy way to understand this plexus is to recognise that all the sensory fibres form a superficial part,

315 THE BRAIN On each side of the medulla the cisterna pontis com- municates with the cisterna magna [c. cerebello-medullaris], which occupies the space between the fourth ventricle and the inferior surface of the cerebellum. If the arachnoid has not already been torn here, open it very carefully and examine the roof of the fourth ventricle near its lower part for the foramen of Majendie [apertura medialis ventriculi quartij. On each side of the medulla look for the cut vertebral arteries. The cisterna pontis, when it is opened, may also be followed round the crura cerebri, on each side, to the region of the great transverse fissure, where the cisterna venoi magna} cereh-i lies just behind and below the splenium of the corpus callosum. In all these cisterns the space between the arachnoid and pia mater is considerable, the trabecular network is loose and delicate, while the great vessels and the beginning of all the cranial nerves lie among its meshes surrounded by the cerebro-spinal fluid. On the surface of the brain, however, the arachnoid is fairly closely connected to the subjacent pia mater at the convexities of the convolutions, while between the convolutions there is a series of spaces in which the blood vessels lie, and the trabecule become finer again. These spaces form a network of rivers (flumina), which eventually open into the cisternte. The Pacchionian bodies on the surface of the arachnoid have already been considered (see p. 61). The Pia Mater of the brain [p.m. encephah] differs a good deal from that of the spinal cord, since it is reflected into all the sulci either as a single or a double layer, while at the great transverse fissure and its continuations, the choroidal fissure of each side, it is pushed into the interior of the brain, enclosing the choroid plexuses of veins and forming the tela chorioidea or vehom interpositum. The smaller cerebral and cerebellar arteries and veins are

xii GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING On the Art of Dissecting.â€”It is often said nowadays that the art of dissecting is dead, and it is also said that the good dissector makes a bad surgeon. It is perfectly true that we seldom see now the elaborate dissections which prosectors in the old days used to prepare for the Anatomy lectures, but the reason for this is not so much that the necessary skill is absent as that the necessary time cannot be given. Students cannot now spare one, two, or three days, as they used, to prepare the subject of one lecture; nor is it really necessary that they should, for, Avhen the skin is removed and the part under discussion exposed, the modern Anatomy lecturer often prefers to dis- play, with a sweep or two of his knife, the various structures lying in their real positions among the surrounding cellular tissue; explaining to his class, as he does so, the different landmarks he is using. The old idea of dissecting was to remove every particle of cellular tissue, or to condense it into fascial planes often of purely artificial production ; by so doing all the other struc- tures were left, perfectly cleaned, in all sorts of strange relationships to one another. The more rational method is to do anything that is necessary to enable the dissector to see what the various structures look like and how they are placed in regard to neighbouring structures, so that he shall have little difficulty in finding or avoiding them in the living body as they lie embedded in the surrounding cellular To do this it is by no means always desirable to clear away all the tissue which surrounds them; it is better to leave patches here and there to keep them in place. Then remember that the deeper the dissection goes the more will the superficial structures become displaced, and for this reason it is most desirable to get into the way of makmg a rough sketch of the superficial things as they He before

PREVERTEBRAL REGION 241 while, more superficially, is the posterior belly of the digastric (see Fig. 108). In front are the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, while the styloid process, with the muscles rising from it especially the stylo-pharyngeus, is very near. Internally is the vertebral artery and the beginning of its vein, together with the anterior division of the first cervical nerve, and, more internally, the capsule of the occipito-atlantal joint. Posteriorly is the obhquus capitis superior muscle fsee Fig. Ill, p. 246). ^ The Second Stage of the Vertebral Artery and the Cervical Nerves in relation to it The first part of the vertebral artery was followed to the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, where it enters on its second stage. The best way to get a good idea of the relations of the artery in this part of its course is to disarticulate the third from the fourth cervical vertebra, keeping as close to the former as possible and avoiding any injury to the fourth cervical nerve, the roots of which can be seen leaving the already-opened spinal canal (see Fig. 109). The vertehral vein should be looked for on the outer side of the artery, though sometimes it breaks up into a plexus and surrounds the latter. Carefully dissect out the nerve, following its two roots until they join, and notice how it passes behind the vertebral artery and vein and then divides at once into anterior and posterior primary divisions lying in the laterally directed trough which the upper part of the transverse process forms Notice very carefully that in the intervertebral foramen where the ganglion on the posterior root lies, the nerve passes m front of the articular processes Before the nerve is clear of the intervertebral foramen the ^anterior and posterior roots unite, and very soon after Q

UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS DENTAL SCHOOL. GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING The point which the authors of this book wish to impress most strongly upon the student is that in dissecting the human body he is about to make a complete and systematic investigation for himself, and that he will reap three separate and distinct advantages from the process. Firstly, he will learn to observe and record things as they really are. Secondly, he will learn the structure of the human body, in curing the ills of which his life will probably be spent. Thirdly, he will acquire a technical skill in the use of several instruments, and, if he is wise, of his pencil too, in making sketches of thin'gs as they really are. Each of these points will bear more careful consideration. On Observing Things as they are.â€”It is of the first importance that no student of nature should become a slave to his books. Let him use them by all means, but always in a sceptical and critical spirit. Books are good servants but intolerable masters where nature is concerned, and if a student once gets into the habit of believing all that is printed, there is httle hope of his ever materially advancing natural science of any kind. Let the investigation be conducted as if it had never been done before, and when the dissection does not seem to agree with the book's description, the dissector should set down in precise words his view of the case and then talk it over with his demonstrator. Perhaps he has failed to notice something which may put a perfectly different complexion

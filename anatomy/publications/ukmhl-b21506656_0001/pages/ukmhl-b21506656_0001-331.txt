THE BRAIN 311 Just above the fimbria, between it and the optic thalamus (see Fig. 138), the tela chorioidea is pushed into the descend- ing horn of the lateral ventricle, and contains the choroid plexus of that horn between its layers. When it is pulled out, the descending horn is opened and the gap through which the plexus has been withdrawn is the choroid fissure, Fig. 139.â€”Medial Sagittal Section of the Cerebrum. Isth.

When viewed from behind it will be seen that this fissure, with its lateral continuations, the two choroid fissures, make a crescentic opcnmg with its concavity downwards.' It is all

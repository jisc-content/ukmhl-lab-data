393 THE HIP-JOINT ably increased by a fibro-cartilaginous ring, which is attached to the rim of the cavity where this is fornned by the carti- laginous-covered surface, but bridges over the cotyloid notch, or interval between the ends of the horse-shoe, forming a foramen through which pass the articular branch of the obturator nerve and a branch of the obturator artery. These structures then run in the ligamentum teres to the head of the femur. The fibro-cartilaginous ring is known as the cotyloid ligament [labrum glenoidale], and immediately to its outer side the capsule is attached (see Fig. 168, Cot.). Identify the structures round the joint, and particularly notice the ilio-psoas passing in front of the capsule on its way to be inserted into the lesser trochanter aud the bone below. THE LEG The leg, or that portion of tke lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle, is conveniently divided into four parallel and vertical regions, viz. the internal surface of the tibia, the anterior tibio-fibular compartment, the peroneal or fibular region, and the posterior tibio-fibular compartment. The internal surface of the tibia is entirely subcutaneous except in its upper fourth, where the flat tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus are inserted into it. Make an incision along the anterior border of the tibia from the knee to the ankle. From the lower end of this incision carry the knife horizontally inwards and outwards to the internal and external malleoli. Reflect the skin inwards, thereby exposing the superficial fascia covermg the internal surface of the tibia. Lying in this fascia, just behind the inner border of the tibia, are two cutaneous nerves and a large vein. The vein will be at once noted; it is the internal or long saphenous, already studied in the dissection of the thigh. Very close to it lies the larger of the two nerves—the internal sopJietious—while still farther back, in the upper part of the dissection, the posterior division of

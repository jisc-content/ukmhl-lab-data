THE BRAIN 296 Between the two the j^rs intermedia, a delicate nerve bundle, should be looked for. Behind and below the pons is the ventral surface of the Medulla Oblongata, a conical structure about an inch long, tapering as it descends to become continuous with the spinal cord. In the mid line of the medulla is the antero-med/ian fissure, on each side of which lie the pyramids. Open up the median fissure very carefully, and it will be seen that fibres from the greater part of the pyramids decussate in order to form the crossed pyramidal tract of the cord. This occurs in the lower part of the medulla, about the level of the foramen magnum. On the outer side of each pyramid lies the oval olive, and, from the cleft between them, the fibres of the hypoglossal or tivelfth cranial nerve emerge in a vertical line. Behind the oHve the restiform body runs up, and then turns outwards and backwards into the cerebellum, forming the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Just below the olive, on each side, some curved fibres, with their concavity upwards, should be looked for; they come out of the anterior median fissure, and curve round the lower pole of the olive to join the restiform bodies. They are known as the anterior superficial arcuate fibres [tibrse arcuatse externfe], and they vary very much in distinct- ness in different brains. From the groove between the olive and restiform body of each side emerge the fibres of the glosso-pharyngeal or ninth cranial nerve, the vagus or tenth, and the sp)inal accessory or eleventh from above downwards. On each side of the medulla and pons is the Inferior Surface of the Cerebellum, which may be conveniently studied now as far as it can be seen. If the lateral parts of the pons Varolii are followed into the cerebellum, of which they form the middle peduncles, they will be seen to divide the organ into a superior and an

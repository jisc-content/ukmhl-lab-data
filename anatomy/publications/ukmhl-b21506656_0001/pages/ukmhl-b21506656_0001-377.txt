THE POPLITEAL SPACE 357 THE POPLITEAL SPACE After tiie dissection of the buttock, it is convenient to pass to the study of the popliteal space, the boundaries of which are kept in position by the unreflected skin of the back of the thiofh above and of the back of the calf below. The space is in reality an inter-muscular cleft between the ham- string muscles above and the calf muscles below. It is occupied by the popliteal vessels and nerves, surrounded by a considerable amount of fatty areolar tissue, in Avhich a few lymphatic nodes may be found. Superficial Anatomy Before reflecting the skin of the region note that in the undissected state the surface is slightly convex so long as the knee is extended, whereas in the dissected state the space will be found to be deeply cupped. A well-marked trans- verse crease should also be noticed; it is situated some dis- tance above the line of the knee-joint. On either side of the space the hamstring tendons can be readily felt—on the out- side the tendon of the biceps, on the inside the tendon of the semi-tendinosus superficial, and that of the semi-membranosus deep. These tendoos can be most readily felt in one's own leg, and can be rendered very distinct by flexing the knee. Immediately to the inner side of the tendon of the biceps, and close to the head of the fibula, the external popliteal nerve can be rolled between the finger and the underlying bone. Dissection.—Make a median incision through the skin covering the space beginning and ending a hand's-breadth above and below the level of the knee-joint. At the ex- termities of this incision make transverse incisions from the inner to the outer border of the limb. Reflect the skin care- fully inward and outward. In the upper half of the space a

PREVERTEBRAL REGION 243 posterior runs backwards before the posterior intertransverse muscle is reached, while the anterior continues its course out- wards between the intertransverse muscles. If the injection is good a spinal branch may be seen running inwards to the spinal canal from the vertebral artery, while other small twigs run forwards to anastomose with the ascending cervical artery in front of the transverse processes, backwards to the profunda cervicis behind them, and outwards to the origins of the muscles of the posterior triangle. In dissecting the suboccipital triangle (Eig. Ill), it was seen that the first nerve passed behind the occipito-atlantal arti- culation, and, if the course of the second cervical is followed, It too will be seen to pass behind the atlanto-axial articular facets, so that these two are exceptions to the general course of the spinal nerves. The whole course of the second part of the vertebral artery may be laid bare by snipping away the transverse pro- cesses on one side, and it will be noticed how the artery turns outwards after leaving the vertebrarterial canal in the axis on Its way to reach that of the atlas. THE JOINTS OF THE NECK An examination of the separated surfaces of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae will give a very good idea of the means by which the lower six cervical vertebrae are ioined together. '' _ Between the centra is the intervertebral disc [fibro-cartila^o mtervertebrahs], a dense mass of fibrous tissue which binds together the two cartilage-covered surfaces. If a coronal section is made through two of the cptiH-, ower down, it will be noticed that wherf the upturned hp (neuro-central hp) comes into contact with the body o the vertebra above, a small synovial cavity is formed which IS a peculiarity of the cervical region (Fio- 112)

150 PRACTICAL ANATOMY insinuates itself between the external and internal pterygoid muscles, and is known as the pterygoid lobe (see Fig. 75, Pt.L.). The structures embedded in the gland are:— 1. (Most superficially.) The Preauricular Lymph Nodes, which are very small, and lie in front of the tragus. T.P. Fig. 74.—Diagram op the Distribution of the Facial Nerve. T.F. Tempore-facial Division of Pes Anserinus. T. Temporal Branch. Mai. Malar Branch. I.O. Infraorbital Branch. B. Buccal Branch. Mand. Mandibular Branch. G. Cervical Branch. O.F. Cervico- facial Division of Pes Anserinus. S.H.Dig. Branch to Stylo-hyoid and Posterior Belly of Digastric Muscles. P.Aur. Posterior Auricular Branch. E.A.M. External Auditory Meatus. Sf.M.F". Stylo-mastoid* Foramen. 2. The Great Auricular Nerve emerging from the surface of the gland to supply the skin superficial to it. 3. The Facial Nerve, which should be reached by following as many of the facial branches as have been preserved into the gland, and by picking away the glandular substance superficial to them. In this way the pes anserimvs or plexus of the facial nerve [plexus parotidea] will be exposed, and eventually the main trunk will be followed as far as the

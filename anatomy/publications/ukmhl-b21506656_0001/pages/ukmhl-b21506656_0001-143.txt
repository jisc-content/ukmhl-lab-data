123 THE FACE remarkable for anastomosing very freely across the middle line as the scalp arteries do. The face is also supplied with blood by the transverse facial [A. transversa faciei] branch of the superficial tem- poral artery, which runs forwards just above and parallel to Stensen's duct, and by the infraorbital artery [A. infra- orbitalis], which accompanies the nerve out of the infra- orbital foramen. The Facial Lymphatic Nodes are small, but because of their clinical importance should be looked for with great care. One or two preauricular nodes [Lymphoglandulse parotidte] are embedded in the top of the parotid and receive lymphatics from the side of the scalp, upper part of the face, and eyelids. Buccal nodes [Lymphoglandulse faciales profundse], on the surface of the buccinator, drain the side of the face, while occasionally an infraorbital and lateral nasal node may be found close to the facial vein in these regions, though usually the lymphatics from the front of the scalp and face accompany the facial vein down to the submaxillary nodes already noticed (see p. 87). The lower lip and chin lymphatic vessels pass down to the suprahyoid nodes (see p. 85), while those from the upper lip may drain into the submaxillary, suprahyoid, or pre- auricular nodes. It must be constantly borne in mind that lymphatic vessels here, as elsewhere, communicate freely with one another, and also, across the middle line, with those of the opposite side. THE MOUTH At this stage it will be well to make an examination of the interior of the mouth from in front, though every- thing to be seen in this way can be seen very much better by looking into two or three living persons' mouths or even by an examination of one's own mouth with a looking-glass. Between the lips and the gums and teeth is the vesti-

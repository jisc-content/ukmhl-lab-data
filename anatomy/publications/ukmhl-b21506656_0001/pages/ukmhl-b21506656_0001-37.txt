17 SUBOCCIPITAL TRIANGLE The Obliquus Capitis Superior runs from the transverse process of the atlas to the occipital bone between the superior and inferior curved lines, and under cover of the outer edge of the complexus. Look for a twig from the suboccipital nerve near its inner border. The Rectus Gapitis Posticus Major [M. R, C. Posterior Major] runs from the spine of the axis to the inferior curved line of the occipital bone deep to the insertion of the obliquus superior. Its nerve, also derived from the suboccipital, enters it on its superficial surface and is of fair size (see Fig. 7). In cleaning these muscles the suboccipital plexus of veins, into which the occipital vein drains, will be much in the way, and great care must be taken to find any of the twigs of the suboccipital nerve. The upper cut end of the complexus should now be replaced in order to realise that this muscle alone forms the roof of the triangle. When this has been done it may be cut short in order to get it out of the way, and its insertion into the inner part of the space between the superior and inferior curved lines noted. The floor of the suboccipital triangle is formed below by the posterior arch of the atlas, and above by the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament running up from it to the occipital bone. Put a dried atlas into the relative position of that in the body and, comparing the two specimens, notice that the vertebral artery [A. vertebralis], in this its third part, comes through the vertebrarterial foramen, and then runs inwards just above the posterior arch, having the superior articular process of the atlas immediately in front of it. As it reaches the inner side of the process the artery pierces the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament and is then lost to view. Now follow any of the branches of the suboccipital nerve [N. suboccipitalis] which have been found to the main trunk. This, which is the posterior primary division of the VOL. I. g

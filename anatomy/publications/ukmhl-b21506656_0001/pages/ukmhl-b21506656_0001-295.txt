THE INTERNAL EAll region is a difficult one and the relations of the various nerves are sometimes of clinical importance, no excuse is necessary for mentioning them again from another point of view. 1. The opening of 'the aquedudus Fallopii is the highest and transmits the facial nerve. 2. The area crihrosa superior comes next, and transmits the branch of the auditory nerve to the utricle, superior, and external semicircular canals. A.O.Sup. (2) A T.Sp.P.

A.C.Med. Area Cribrosa Media. F.Sing. Foramen Singulare. (The numbers in brackets refer to the Ust in the letterpress.) 3. The crista falciformis runs across and separates these from the rest. 4. The tractus spiralis lies just below the crista, and the nerves to the cochlea go through it. 5. The area crihrosa media lies behind the last and transmits the twigs to the saccule. 6. The foramen singulare is the lowest and most posterior of all the openings in the lamina cribrosa, and through it passes the nerve to the posterior semicircular canal. *

319 THE BRAIN The anterior spinal artery is generally the last branch of the vertebral, and soon joins its fellow of the opposite side to form the single median artery already studied. It is usually much larger on one side than on the other. The basilar artery is about an inch long, and corresponds to the depth of the pons, lying in the slight mid-ventral groove A..C.A. PC. A.

It gives off a number of transverse branches to the pons, as welf as a delicate auditory artery [a. auditiva interna] to the internal auditory meatus (see Fig. 140). The anterior inferior cerebellar artery also comes off the trunk of the basilar and runs outwards to the front of the mferior surface of the cerebellum. Sometimes it does the work of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery as well When the upper border of the pons is reached, the basilar

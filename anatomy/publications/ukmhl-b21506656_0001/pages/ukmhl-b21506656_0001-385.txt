THE THIGH 365 Deep to this origin of the inner head of the gastrocnemius hes a bursa which frequently communicates Avith the knee- joint (see Fig. 159). The outer head arises from a pit on the outer surface of the external condyle and from the adjacent portion of the popliteal surface. In its tendon of origin a sesamoid fibro- cartilage is occasionally present. Above and to the inner side of the outer head of the muscle the small fleshy belly of the Plantaris is usually to be seen arising from the popliteal surface of the femur. In a considerable number of cases, however, it is absent. The upper portion of the Soleus should next be exposed by separating gently with the handle of a scalpel the two fleshy heads of the gastrocnemius and looking in the interval between them, when its arched tendinous upper border will be observed. Next with the finger hook the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve to the inner side, thereby exposing much fat, the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and the popliteus muscleâ€”the latter covered by a dense fascia. The soleus, popliteus, and the capsule of the knee- joint will be much better studied later. BACK OF THE THIGH Make a median incision through the skin which has been left on the back of the thigh, and reflect it carefully to either side. A diligent search should now be made in the superficial fascia for branches of the small sciatic nerve. The search is aided by pulling upon tlie small sciatic where it has been exposed already in the regions of the buttock and popliteal space. The branches are particularly found near the middle line. They are reinforced on the outer side by the posterior branches of the external cutaneous nerve. The superficial fascia may now be removed, and the dense deep fascia (fascia lata) binding the structures together exposed. Divide this latter fascia, thereby exposing the hamstring muscles in

231 THE LARYNX While dissecting the following muscles, it will be advis- able to trace the branches of the recv/rrent laryngeal nerve to them. The trunk of the nerve was preserved in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and it should now be made tense with hooks. A little behind the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and close to its articulation with the cricoid, the nerve divides into two branches. Of these the anterior supplies the crico- arytenoideus lateralis and thyro-arytenoideus, while the posterior passes through the crico-arytenoideus posticus and then enters the arytenoideus. It is this latter branch which communicates with the internal laryngeal nerve. Notice that all the laryngeal muscles receive their nerves on their superficial aspects. Divide one ala of the thyroid cartilage by a vertical incision a Httle to one side of the middle line, and remove it by freeing the mucous membrane. In doing this remember that the thyroid cartilages are usually more or less ossified after middle life. Look for the thyro-arytenoideus muscle, which rises in front close to the angle of the thyroid cartilage and runs back to be inserted into the antero-external surface of the pyramidal arytenoid. A few fibres pass up to the side of the epiglottis, while others form a delicate sheath for the surface of the laryngeal saccule, and are known as the compressor sacculi laryngis [M. ventricularis]. Lying parallel and immediately external to the true vocal cord is a slightly thickened bundle, known as the thyro-arytenoideus internus [M. vocalis], some of the fibres of which are inserted into the cord. The thyro-arytenoid will obviously draw the arytenoid cartilage forward and so relax the cord, in this way acting as an antagonist to the crico-thyroid; but when the two muscles act together the latter is the more poAverful, and the thyro- arytenoideus will then, by its contraction, approximate the two cords with the accuracy necessary for proper phonatioa.

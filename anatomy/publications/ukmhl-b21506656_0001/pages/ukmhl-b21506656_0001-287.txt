267 THE INTERNAL EAR The Internal Ear or Labyrinth The student must be content to gain a general survey of the internal ear in the dissecting-room, but if this is care- fully done it will make the more dehcate histological study much easier to understand. The internal ear consists of the cochlea, the vestibule, and the semicircular canals. The Cochlea is seen to some extent in the section on the right side, which passes through the two auditory meatus; this generally cuts the inner wall of the tympanum at the promontory, and, as this promontory is caused by the first i turn of the cochlea, it is possible that the section will only show one or two turns of the latter (see Fig. 115). ' It must be reahsed that the cochlea is a spiral staircase, containing two and a half turns, twisted round a central pillar called the modiolus. The base of the modiolus is at the internal auditory meatus, but its apex points forwards i and outwards, and a complete section through its long axis I may be made by fixing the specimen in a vice and making a I fret-saw cut from the bottom of the internal auditory meatus to the re-entering angle between the petrous and squamous â– parts of the temporal bone, or, if a third ear is available, by making the horizontal section advised on p. 253 (see Fig. 114). The various turns of the spiral will now be seen, and it will be noticed that in each one a shelf of bone projects ,j from the modiolus about half-way across the passage. This ! spiral shelf is called the lamina spiralis, and from its free end two membranes may just be made out running to the cochlear wall, and diverging as they go to enclose a canal which is triangular in section, and is known as the scala I media. I ^ This scala or staircase is particularly important, because i it contains the organ of Corti [organon spirale], or essen- tial organ of hearing. It is filled with a fluid known as endolymph.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 322 artery, the superior cerebellar from the basilar, to supply it, while the lower surface has two, the anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar, the former from the basilar, the latter from the vertebral. The Exposure of the Coiipus Callosum from above.— Draw the two cerebral hemispheres apart, and notice the upper surface of the corpus callosum acting as a great bridge between them (this body has already been studied in sagittal section on p. 305). Quite close to the mid line on each side is a white longi- tudinal stripe {stria longitudinalis medialis); while if one hemisphere be forcibly pulled aside, another stripe, formed of grey matter {stria longitudinalis lateralis), comes into view. The next thing is to understand what the corpus callosum does when it enters the brain. To do this, take a long brain knife and slice the top of the brain o£E horizontally half-way down to the level of the top of the corpus callosum. Notice the mass of white matter (centrum ovale minus), in the middle of each hemisphere, surrounded by the superficial grey cortex, which lines all the gyri and sulci, and averages some fifth of an inch in thickness. Take another horizontal slice on one side only at the level of the upper surface of the corpus callosum. It is quite possible that this will open the lateral ventricle, because the corpus callosum forms its roof, and runs upwards and out- wards on each side into the central mass of white matter, which is here known as the centrum ovale majxis (see Fig. 149, 6). On the other side of the brain, remove the callosal con- volution by breaking it carefully outwards from above the corpus callosum, and look at the upper surface of the latter. Its fibres will now be seen running outwards as the tapetum, while those coming from the genu pass forwards and outwards to form, when the two sides are exposed, the forceps minor. In the same way the fibres from the splenium run back-

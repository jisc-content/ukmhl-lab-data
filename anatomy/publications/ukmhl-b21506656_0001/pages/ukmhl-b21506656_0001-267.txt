THE NECK 247 The accessory atlanto-axial ligaments should now be looked for running obliquely from the atlas, just behind the lateral attachments of the transverse ligament, to the back of the centrum of the axis, to the capsule of which they give support. When the upper Hmb of the crucial ligament is cut the odontoid process will come into view, and from both sides of its conical tip the alar or check ligaments [ligg. alaria] are seen running horizontally outwards to the tubercles on the inner surfaces of the occipital condyles. These are the liga- ments by which the whole weight of the body is suspended from the head when a child is hfted up by its chin and occiput; they also greatly strengthen the occipito-atlantal joints, which are otherwise not very strong. Passing up from the very apex of the odontoid process to the anterior edge of the foramen magnum is the middle check ligament [lig. apicis dentis], feeble, sometimes absent, and never of any practical importance, yet of considerable morphological interest, because in it lie the remains of the notochord and its sheath. It may be worth while, before leaving them, to review these median ligaments, this time from before backwards:â€” 1. Most anteriorly is the median part of the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, the upward continuation of the anterior common ligament (see Fig. 110). 2. The middle check ligament. 3. The upper limb of the crucial ligament. 4. The posterior occipito-axial ligament. 5. Behind the spinal cord, the posterior occipito-atlantal litjament. Now make a coronal section passing across the body of the third cervical vertebra, the body of the axis, the odontoid process and the articulations between the atlas and the occipital bone. This will show that the little synovial spaces between the neuro-central lips of the third cervical body and the adjacent

THE ORBIT 209 The Ophthalmic veins are difBculb to dissect unless they are specially injected ; their chief points of interest are that they communicate freely in front with the facial vein, while behind they do not accompany the artery, since the larger part of them opens into the cavernous sinus through the anterior lacerated foramen, and the smaller joins the pterygoid plexus through the spheno-maxillary fissure. The course of the optic nerve and the position of the eyeball in the orbit should be carefully noted. It will be seen that the inner orbital wall is directly antero-posterior, while the outer slopes forwards and outwards from the optic foramen; consequently the axis of the cone which the orbit makes runs forwards and outwards from the apex, and the optic nerve lies in this axis. The antero-posterior axis of the eyeball therefore does not correspond either with the long axis of the orbit or the axis of the optic nerve. Notice, too, that the front of the cornea in the living eye comes well up to the level of the orbital margin, when a rod is placed vertically across it, but when the rod is placed transversely it will be seen that the cornea projects rather beyond the plane of the outlet. _ Now cut the optic nerve and lift the distal end upwards m order to see the lower division of the third nerve and the sixth nerve, which lie below. The lower division of the third nerve can be traced through the anterior lacerated foramen between the two heads of the external rectus, when it divides mto branches for the internal and inferior recti, and the interior obhque; the two former enter the ocular surfaces of their muscles very soon, but the latter is quite a long nerve which should be traced forwards to the posterior border of he inferior obhque muscle, giving off on its way the motor branch to the ciliary ganglion. The internal rectus muscle [M. rectus medialis] should be examined next It rises just internal to the optic foramen .and IS remarkable for being the thickest of all the orbita recti muscles, as well as for being inserted nearest (about o

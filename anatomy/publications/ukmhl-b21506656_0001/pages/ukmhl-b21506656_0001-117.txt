THE NECK 97 Notice that the cervical cellular tissue surrounds the gland, and is especially plentiful below; it forms what is often spoken of as the sheath of the gland. The superior and middle thyroid veins have already been seen. The Inferior Thyroid Vein runs down with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the trachea, and the two veins often form a plexiform anastomosis before they unite to open into the left innominate vein. In following these down, the front of the trachea in its cervical course will be exposed, and it should be noticed how much further from the surface this tube gets as it goes down, and how greatly its length is increased by throwing back the head. In cleaning the front of the trachea one or two small pretracheal lymph nodes should be looked for. Sometimes from the isthmus of the thyroid a pyramidal lobe of glandular tissue ascends towards the hyoid bone; it is generally a httle to one side of the middle line. One half of the thyroid gland may be extirpated, and in doing this a little more cutting will be required at the back of each lateral lobe, near the first ring of the trachea, than elsewhere. Just behind this point the recurrent laryngeal nerve [N. recurrens] is situated among the branches of the inferior thyroid artery. Every student who wishes to become a good surgical and medical anatomist should attend the post-mortem room frequently and check his own dissection by the large and varied amount of material which is to be seen there. In this region he should especially notice how often the left innominate vein hes above the level of the supra-sternal notch in the child, and how easily it might be cut in the neck. He should also notice that in the child the top of the thymus gland often comes up into the lower part of the neck. There are two small Parathyroid Glands on each side embedded in the thyroid.

THE BRAIN 287 THE BASE OF THE BRAIN In removing ttie brain from the head the dissectors divided the crura cerebri, so that all the parts above the tentorium cerebelli are in the larger specimen, while those below are in the smaller. The greatest difficulty in cleaning the brain will be found in the base where the cranial nerves are. These should be cleaned with scissors or a very sharp knife, taking great care not to grasp them with the forceps, since they tear away from the brain so very easily. Starting from in front the inferior surface of the frontal lobe is seen on each side, and it will be noticed that it is concave from side to side to adapt it to the convex orbital roof. There is an intra-orhital sulcus which is very incon- stant, but is most often H-shaped, and then divides the surface into external, infernal, anterior, and posterior orbital gyri. Of these the external is continuous with the inferior frontal convolution on the outer surface of the brain, while the internal is bounded medially by a straight sulcus (sulcus rectus or olfactory sulcus), which lodges the olfactory tract and bulb. Internal to this, between it and the longitudinal fissure, is the gyrus rectus, the posterior part of which belongs functionally to the olfactory region of the brain and is known as Broca's area [area parolfactoria]. Note that this has nothing to do with Broca's convolution, the motor speech centre (see p. 284). The Olfactory Bulb lies under (in the anatomical position) the sulcus rectus, and is an oval mass of grey matter, from which the numerous olfactory nerves pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. These are so delicate that nothing is likely to be seen of them. The Olfactory Tract is a narrow band, triangular in section, and about three-quarters of an inch long, which runs back from the bulb beneath the sulcus rectus and, widening

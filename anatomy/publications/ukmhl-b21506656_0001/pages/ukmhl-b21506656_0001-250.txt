230 PRACTICAL ANATOMY opening of the laryngeal saccule [ventriculus laryngis], which will be explored later. On looking down into the larynx from in front, a rounded convexity on the epiglottis, near its attachment, will be seen. This is the cushion of the epiglottis [tuberculum epi- glotticum], and is very much in the way in using the laryngoscope, since it hides the anterior commissure of the true vocal cords. Push a needle through the crico-thyroid space, and notice that it enters the larynx below the level of the true vocal cords, a piece of anatomical knowledge which may be of great value in an emergency. The Muscles and Nerves of the Larynx Now dissect the muscles carefully on one side. The larynx is sometimes nailed to a block of wood during its dissection, but, as any change of position necessitates drawing the nails and putting in others, it will be found more convenient to drive two nails an inch apart into a block in such a way that they slope away from one another. These will hold the larynx in any required position without injuring it. Where small sandbags are provided, these form by far the best wÂ«,y of steadying irregular-shaped objects; they may be covered with well-oiled canvas. The crico-thyroid muscle [M. crico-thyreoideus] rises from the lower border of the thyroid cartilage as well as from the front of the inferior cornu, and is inserted into the antero- lateral part of the ring of the cricoid cartilage. The external braiich of the superior laryngeal nerve has been traced to it already. By drawing the front part of the cricoid up towards the thyroid, its posterior part, which supports the arytenoids, is tilted back, and so the arytenoids have to go back too, thus stretching the true cords.

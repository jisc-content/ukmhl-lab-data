THE NECK 37 between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process to the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. If this line is prolonged until it meets the trapezius, it is not far off the nerve. The spinal accessory is often mistaken for the supra- acromial in the examination room, but it enters the trapezius on its deep surface, while the supra-acromial passes super- ficially. Spinal accessory communicating branches run outwards and join the eleventh nerve in the posterior triangle and also deep to the trapezius ; they come from the third and fourth cervical spinal nerves. The deep cervical lymphatic nodes, which make it so important to know the exact course of the spinal accessory nerve, are normally deep to the sterno-mastoid, though, when they enlarge, they protrude into the posterior triangle. They will be seen better later on. The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle should next be found; it runs across the lower part of the triangle in a direction downwards and outwards, appearing from under cover of the sterno-mastoid about an inch above the clavicle. It divides the posterior triangle into two parts, of which the upper is known as the occipital and the lower as the supra- clavicular triangle. Look for the nerve to the posterior belly of the omo- hyoid with great care; it lies just behind the muscle or tendon as it comes from under cover of the sterno-mastoid; its presence in a dissection generally indicates a good dissector. Now clean the occipital part of the posterior triano-le and examine its floor. In doing this several twigs of the Superficial cervical artery [A. cervicalis superficialis] will be seen, and to some of them small lymphatic nodes are attached. The muscles forming the floor of this triano-lo arc the Splenius capitis, Levator anguli scapula. Scalenus posticus, and Scalenus medius from above downwards and then- fibres all run downwards, outwards, and backwards'

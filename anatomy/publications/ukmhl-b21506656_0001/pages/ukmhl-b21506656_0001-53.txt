33 THE NECK upper limb have finished their axilla, they will saw through the clavicle and remove the extremity.' As this seriously interferes with the relations of the triangle, its dissection should be taken in hand as soon as the body is finally placed on its back. Place a block beneath the shoulders and hook the face over to the opposite side, thus making the neck tense. If the dissector of the upper extremity is not at work, pull down the shoulder as much as possible; later on it will be realised how gTeat a difference this makes to the contents of the triangle. Surface Anatomy.—Through the skin the outline of the sterno-mastoid is seen, with the clavicle below and the mastoid process above. The edge of the trapezius is not as evident as that of the sterno-mastoid, but it should be understood that in the undissected state the posterior triano-le is a very narrow space, often not more than half an inch across, until the lower part is reached. The external jugular vein is often seen in life throuo-h the skin. Its superficial landmark is a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle. Dissection.—Make a skin incision from the mastoid process to the inner end of the clavicle. Do not cut too deeply, because of the underlying platysma muscle. From the lower end of this incision make another, through the skm only, along the line of the clavicle if this incisiSn has not been made already by the dissector of the upper extremity. Reflect the flap of skin thus outlined until the anterior edge of the trapezius is exposed (see cuts 4 and 5 Fig. 17). ' The platysma muscle is now seen as a very delicate sheet running downwards and backwards from the mouth reo-ion and passing superficial to the clavicle. Divide this below and reflect it upwards, noticing how very thin it is In dissecting it up notice that there is loose cellular tissue deep to it which collapses into a definite sheet as the c

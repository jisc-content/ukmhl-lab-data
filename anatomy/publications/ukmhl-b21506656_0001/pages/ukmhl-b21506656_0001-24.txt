4 PRACTICAL ANATOMY two-thirds of tlic superior curved line of the occipital bone. Notice that its fibres are only about an inch long, so that its action must be very slight. It is supplied by the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve, which will be exposed later, or may, if time allows, be looked for now (p. 50). THE SPINAL REGION FROM BEHIND As soon as the dissectors of the upper extremity have cleaned the upper part of the trapezius, the higher part of the posterior triangle of the neck should be defined by cleaning the edge of the muscle carefully, and then following the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle downwards for a couple of inches. In doing this notice that the sterno-mastoid is inserted into the outer two-thirds of the superior occipital curved line as well as into the mastoid process, and look very carefully for the small occipital nerve [N. occipitalis minor] which runs up along the posterior border of this muscle. The floor of the posterior triangle is very narrow here, and is formed by the splenius capitis, the fibres of which run upwards and outwards (see Fig. 2). The outline of the upper part of this triangle will be interfered with by the subsequent dissection, so that it is important to get a clear mental picture of it now. If possible, a sketch of the dissection at this stage should be made, as it is very difficult to dissect the whole of the triangle with the body either on its face or on its As soon as the arm dissectors have finished their two superficial layers of muscles, the deeper back muscles and the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves should be examined. Before beginning the dissection of the muscles notice that the dissectors of the upper extremity have been asked to leave intact at least two posterior cutaneous nerves,

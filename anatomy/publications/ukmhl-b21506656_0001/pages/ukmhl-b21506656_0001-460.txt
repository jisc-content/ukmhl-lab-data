The dissector sees the fat through the ligament, clears it Fig. 186.â€”Ooromal Section through the Ankle and astragalo-calcaneal joints of 'j'he right foot. I.M. Interosseous Membrane. I.L.

In dissecting the posterior ligament dorsiflex the ankle as far as possible, and begin the dissection in the upper part

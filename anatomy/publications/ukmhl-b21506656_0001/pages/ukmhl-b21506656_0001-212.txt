192 PRACTICAL ANATOMY palati muscle, though at this stage of the dissection the part is not at its best for delicate work. Below the soft palate is the oral pharynx, and in the lateral wall of this two folds are seen on either side running down from the soft palate ; they are known as the pillars of the fauces, the anterior one containing the palato-glossus [arcus glosso-palatinus], and the posterior the palato-pharyngeus [arcus pharyngo-palatinus]. Between these hes the fossa of the tonsil, in which^ the tonsil is seenâ€”an oval body, about three-quarters of an inch long, dotted with twelve to fifteen mucous crypts which sink into'the lymphoid tissue of which the organ is formed. In old people the lymphoid tissue here, as in other parts of the body, shrinks, and the tonsils are not nearly as large as they are in youth. . If a needle is thrust outwards through the tonsil, it will pierce the superior constrictor in front of both carotid arteries, transfix or come into close relation with the facial artery, and appear on the surface about the angle of the jaw. Just above the tonsil is the small triangular supra- tonsillar recess, which sometimes has a small valvular fold of mucous membrane covering it. Dissect the mucous membrane off the anterior pillar ot the ^uices and expose the palato-glossus muscle, which, as it is traced up to the soft palate, forms the lowest muscular layer of that structure ; in the anterior pillar it is cylindrical, and when it reaches the tongue it turns inwards and becomes continuous with the lingualis transversus. Like all the other muscles of the soft palate, except the tensor palati, it is sup- plied by the pharyngeal plexus, deriving its fibres ultimately from the spinal accessory. Before reflecting the mucous membrane from the posterior pillar of the fauces, notice that it is continuous with the pharyngo-epiglottic fold, and where the two join a sma 1 secondary tonsil may sometimes be seen m JO^-g ^^^J- - When the mucous membrane is dissected off, the palato-

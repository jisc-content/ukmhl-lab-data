PRACTICAL ANATOMY 4i4 from it to the dorsal expansion of the extensor tendon to the 5th toe. The Sole of the Foot It is first necessary to fix the foot firinly, sole uppermost, and the best way to do this is to nail one or two of the toes to the upper surface of an upright block and allow the leg to hang down the side; this may also be secured by a lashing of string. Next make a transverse incision just behind the clefts of the toes and, from its middle, another at right angles, which shall run back, along the centre of the sole, to the heel, and turn up to end at the place Avhere the skin was reflected from the back of the calf. In making these incisions the enormous thickness of the skin of the sole, and especially of the heel, will be noticed (see Fig. 178). Reflect these two flaps outwards and inwards and continue the reflexion until the limits of the exposed area on the dorsum are reached. This, of course, means that the flaps will be altogether removed—really an advantage, as they get very much in the way and are not much needed to keep the deeper parts moist, since the dissection is not a long one, and rapidly deepens layer by layer. The superficial fat of the sole and heel will be found thick and very granular, owing to the fibrous septa which pass through it from the skin to the plantar fascia. In working through this the knife should be stropped every few minutes. Close to the webs of the toes a shght bundle of transverse fibres' is found—the superficial trans- verse ligament of the foot corresponding to the same struc- ture in the hand. On the inner side of the heel dissect carefully for a cutaneous nerve which often accompanies the internal cal- caneal branch of the posterior tibial or external plantar artery, and so the artery, when injected, is a useful guide to It. This nerve supplies the skin of the heel and back part

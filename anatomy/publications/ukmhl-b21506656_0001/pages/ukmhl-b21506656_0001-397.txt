THE THIGH 377 the large muscular mass on the front of the thigh, the quadriceps extensor. Their destination will be fully dis- played later. The position of the nerves being carefully borne in mind, clean the floor of the triangle from without inwards, noticing that in this direction its floor is formed by the iliacus, psoas, pectineus, and adductor longus. Sometimes the edges of the adductor longus and pecti- neus do not touch, in which case the adductor brevis is seen between them, but on a deeper plane. In cleaning the surface of this muscle care must be taken not to injure the anterior division of the obturator nerve, which lies verti- cally in front of (superficial to) it (see Fig. 163). When the inner and lower border of the triangle is reached a small branch of the obturator nerve should be looked for, appearing from under cover of the adductor longus, and dis- appearing deep to the sartorius to join the suhsartorial A number of large arteries will now be seen. The Common Femoral has already been noticed as the continua- tion of the external iliac. Abduct the thi^h a little and rotate it outwards, then stretch a piece of string from the point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and symphysis pubis to the back of the inner condyle. This line corresponds to the common and superficial femoral arteries in the upper two-thirds of the thigh. The bifurcation of the common femoral is 1| to 2 inches bel ow Poupart's ligament, after which the superficial and deep femoral arteries must be studied. The Superficial Femoral arterij continues the line of the common femoral, down to the apex of Scarpa's triangle, and gives off no branches of any importance in the triangle. The Deep Femoral artery [Profunda femoris] is equal in size to the superficial; it ruus at first downwards and out- wards for about an inch and then gives oft' its external circumflex branch, after which it changes its direction and

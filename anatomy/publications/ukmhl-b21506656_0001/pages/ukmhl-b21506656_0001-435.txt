THE FOOT 415 of the sole, and is known as the calccmeo-plantar cutaneous [n. plantaris medialis] (see Fig. 173). Farther forward in the sole the skin is supplied by twigs which appear in the intervals of the muscles of the first layer and are quite difiicult to find in the granular fat at this stage. As soon as the fat has been cleared away, the plantar fascia [aponeurosis plantaris] is exposed. This has three parts, the middle of which is very strong, while the two side- pieces are thin and unimportant. Clean the middle part carefully, and notice that it is attached posteriorly to the calcaneum, while anteriorly it divides into five slips, one for each of the toes, diflfering in this way from the similar struc- ture in the hand which does not send a slip to the thumb. Trace one of these slips into a toe, and notice that it divides and eventually reaches the sides of the proximal phalanx after allowing the flexor tendons to pass between the two divisions. Just before the plantar fascia divides for the five toes, a transverse band of fibres prevents it splitting back any farther, and this is known as the superficial transverse metatarsal ligament [fasciculi transversi aponeurosis plan- taris]. The intervals between the five slips are the places in which to look for the digital branches of the plantar arteries and nerves. Remember, in looking for them, that the nerves are superficial to the arteries and will be met with first. Now clear away the thin external and internal parts of the deep plantar fascia in order to expose the muscles which lie deep to them. On the inner side is the abductor hallucis, and on the outer the abductor minimi digili (see Fig. 177). To see the attachments of the abductor hallucis, cut it across about its middle and turn the ends forward and back. It will be found rising from the internal annular ligament, from the inner of the two posterior tubercles of the cal- caneum, and from the inner side of a strong fibrous septum

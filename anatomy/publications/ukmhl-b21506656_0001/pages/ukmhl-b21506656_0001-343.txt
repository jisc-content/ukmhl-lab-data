THE BRAIN 323 wards and outwards and then backwards and inwards to form the forceps major. Now look carefully at the lower surface of the piece of brain, which was broken away in exposing the corpus callosum, for a band of fibres running antero-posteriorly and slightly embedded in the roof of the callosal fissure. This is the cinguhtm, and it is generally torn close to the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. It was formerly regarded as an " association tract" linking up different parts of the brain, but the more modern view is that it is chiefly a " projection tract," carrying fibres from the medial surface of the cortex towards the medulla in front of and behind the corpus callosum. The Lateral Ventricle Make an antero-posterior cut through the corpus callosum just outside the median stria longitudinalis, or two or three millimetres from the mid line. Through the cut push the handle of a scalpel, and, using this as a seeker and guide, gradually cut away the corpus callosum or roof of the lateral ventricle until a good view of the cavity is gained. On referring to the medial section of the brain (p. 308), it is obvious that the fornix lies very close below the corpus callosum posteriorly, while anteriorly it curves downwards and forwards, leaving a considerable interval between the two structures. The thin sharp lateral edge of the fornix must therefore be identified forming the inner part of the floor of the lateral ventricle, and curving outwards and downwards posteriorly as the posterior pillar. To get a good idea of the fornix from above, the opposite lateral ventricle should be opened in the same way as the first, leaving only a very narrow strip of the corpus callosum with its median longitudinal stria3 in the middle line. Now the two posterior pillars of the fornix are seen divergmg, and each curving round to disappear in the

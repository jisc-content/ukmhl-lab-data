226 PRACTICAL ANATOMY transverse lingualis [M. transversus lingua], the fibres of which are attached to the median septum, while laterally they end on the deep surface of the mucous membrane, except posteriorly, where they are continuous with those of the palato-glossus (p. 192). Among these are interwoven vertical fibres, the upward continuation of the genio-hyo-glossus medially and hyo-glossus laterally. G.H.G.

Interior Lingualis. Towards the side of the tongue are a number of oblique fibres running upwards and inwards, sometimes known as the oblique lingualis. Two.antero-posterior bundles of fibres are cut in section. Of these the superior lingualis lies close to the mucous membrane of the dorsum, while the inferior lingualis is a larger and more circumscribed bundle lying between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus (see Fig. 102). If sections are made further forward the inferior lingualis

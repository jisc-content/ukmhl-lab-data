PRACTICAL ANATOMY 76 From the posterior end of the cavernous sinus trace the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, the former of which has been sht up and examined aheady. The inferior petrosal sinus [S. petrosus inferior] is larger than the superior, and there is no sign of it in the cranial base until it is slit open, since it rests in a groove between the petrous and basioccipital bones, and is covered by the cerebral layer of the dura mater. Find its opening from the cavernous sinus at the apex of the petrous bone, and pass a seeker backwards and out- wards along it, gradually slitting it up until the posterior lacerated foramen is reached. It will be found to^ pass just external to the point at which the sixth nerve pierces the dura mater (see Fig. 37). The study of the lateral sinus [S. transversus] may now be finished by sHtting it open from behind the outer end of the petrous bone, where it is resting against the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone at the asterion. It will be seen to run downwards and inwards with an S-shaped curve which gains for this part the name of the sigmoid sinus. This part is of great importance in aural surgery, because it lies so close to the mastoid antrum and mastoid cells. It is therefore well to survey carefully its superficial land- marks, remembering that, as the right lateral sinus is usually larger than the left, it comes into closer relation with the mastoid antrum. The asterion is at the postero-inferior angle of the parietal bone, and also marks the place where the hori- zontal part of the lateral sinus turns down to become the sio-moid sinus. To fix this point on the hving head, draw a line from the lambda (which is a hand's-breadth or 2| inches above the external occipital protuberance) to the tip of the mastoid process; the junction of the middle and lower thirds of this line corresponds very closely to the asterion.

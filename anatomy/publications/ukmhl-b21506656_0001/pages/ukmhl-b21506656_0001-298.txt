THE BRAIN It is most important that every student sliould take a part in tlie dissection of at least two brains. As a rule, there is no difficulty in procuring a sufficient supply for this, but, if the brain in the head and neck dissected is the only one available, by far the best plan is for four dissectors to arrange to work together and to study the two brains in their allotted parts one after the other. In this way structures which are necessarily destroyed in exposing portions of one brain may be seen in the other. It will be assumed that two dissectors have kept the brain which they removed in two portions during the dis- section of the intra-cranial region, and have been able to procure another with the arachnoid membrane and blood vessels intact. The second brain will probably be unmjected, but there is no difficulty in injecting it with coloured plaster of Pans, or better still melted gelatine mixed with some pigment. _ This should be done by putting a glass nozzle fitted with a little india-rubber tubing into the internal carotid artery of one side and another one into the vertebral artery of the opposite side. The vertebral and mternal carotid arteries into which no nozzle is put must of course be tied. Then with an ordinary glass syringe inject the internal carotid first, and if any colour runs out of the nozzle m the vertebral the tubing may be compressed there. The pressure on the syringe should be slow, gentle and even. When the internal carotid has taken as much as it will safely hold, the tubing attached to its nozzle should be tied or plugged, and the vertebral injected in the same way. it

224 PRACTICAL ANATOMY In fhe anterior wall (posterior superior dental canals), posterior superior dental nerves and arteries. In the posterior wall: 1. (foramen rotundum), infraorbital nerve, here generally spoken of as the second division of the fifth; 2. (Vidian canal), Vidian nerve and artery; 3. (pterygo- palatine canal), pterygo-palatine nerve and artery. In the outer wall (pterygo-maxillary fissure), internal maxillary artery. In the inner wall (spheno-palatine foramen), naso-pala- tine nerve and artery, upper nasal nerves. THE TONGUE As the tongue has been partly examined in the mouth (p. 125), in the submaxillary region (p. 141), and in the pharynx, only those parts which have not already come into view need be dealt with here. In the pharynx the V-shaped sulcus terminalis was noticed dividing the superior or dorsal surface from the posterior or pharyngeal. Just in front of this are seen the circumvallate papillce [p. vallatse], of which there are from seven to twelve. Notice that each has a flattened, disc-like, central elevation surrounded by a fossa or ditch, which in its turn is surrounded by a vallum or rampart. At the back of the side of the tongue are some indistinct vertical ridges, the yestigial foliate papillce, so well marked in rodents. It should be noticed that both these sets of papillte are found in the area of the tongue supplied by the glosso- pharyngeal nerve. â€¢ The thread-hke filiform and button mushroom-like fungiform papilla occupy the dorsum, to which the lingual nerve is distributed. Make a coronal section of the tongue, and notice the arrangement of its intrinsic muscles; the extrinsic have already been dealt with (p. 141). In the mid line is the fibrous septum, and if the organ is well mjected it wiU be

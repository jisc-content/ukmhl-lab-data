333 THE BEAIN looked for; it is the collateral eminence, and lies in the floor on the outer side of the hippocampus major. It corresponds to the inpushing of the collateral fissure, and is best seen just in front of the trigonum ventriculi. Structukes Embedded in the Substance of the Cerebral Hemispheres Remove the tela chorioidea and choroid plexuses from the bodies of the lateral ventricles. In doing this the roof of the third ventricle will necessarily be opened. Notice that it is only the attachment of the tela chorioidea to the optic thalamus on each side, with, of course, its covering of ependyma, which prevents the third ventricle from com- municating all along the sides of its roof with the lateral ventricles. As it is, the communication is only possible where the tela chorioidea stops at the foramen of Monro. Notice too that there are two delicate longitudinal fringe- like folds hanging down into the third ventricle from its roof, the lower surface of the tela chorioidea. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Take the long knife and make a section as nearly horizontal as possible through one hemisphere in such a way that it passes through or just above the foramen of Monro and also just above the pineal body. The cut caudate nucleus and optic thalamus will be easily recognised, but, to the outer side of them, there is another mass of grey matter, triangular in this section, with its apex directed imvards. This is the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum [n. lentiformis], and it will be noticed that its inner or apical part is of a distinctly paler colour than the outer; hence this inner part is known as the globus pallidus, while the outer or basal part is the putamen or husk. The globus pallidus often shows a division into outer and inner parts.

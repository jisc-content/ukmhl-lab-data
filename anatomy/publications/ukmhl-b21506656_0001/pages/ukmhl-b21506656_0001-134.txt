114 PRACTICAL ANATOMY fascia and tarsal plate, and how, behind these, the conjunc- tival membrane is reflected off the back of the eyelid, which it lines, on to the eye. This reflexion is called the superior fornix of the con- junctiva, and its limits should be carefully explored; a few fibres of the levator palpebrse are inserted into the fornix. On everting the cut eyelid the yellow Meibomian glands will Fig. 54.â€”Diagrammatic Section of an Eyelid. Fr.S. Frontal Sinus. Orb.Pal. Orbicularis Palpebrarum Muscle. Palp.Lig.

Some large sweat glands, known as Glands of Moll, at the free margin of the lid are noteworthy, since, Avhen-inflamed, they cause a " stye." On making a vertical section of the lower lid the same arrangement of the conjunctiva is seen, but it will be noticed that the lower tarsal plate is not so deep or thick as the upper, and that there is nothing corre- sponding to the levator palpebrte.

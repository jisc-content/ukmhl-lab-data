126 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The fungiform and filiform papillce and mucous mem- brane generally should be carefully observed in a healthy living tongue, since the study of the dissecting-room organ is of little value to a future medical practitioner. The circumvallate papilke cannot be studied from the front of the mouth. On turning up the living tongue the frenulum linguce is obvious in the mid line, coming from a little furrow on the under surface of the organ, and on each side of it the blue outline of the ranine vein is evident through the mucous membrane. Just external to each of these is^ a slight fringed fold of mucous membrane, called the plica fimhriata, the only practical interest of which is that it Hes superficial to the course of the ranine artery. On each side of the frenulum, near its lower attachment, Wharton's papilloi are easily seen; here the submaxillary or Wharton's ducts open. Running back from these is the 'plica suhlingualis marking the upper edge of the sublingual gland with its numerous ducts (see p. 143). Before finally leaving the dissection of the face it will be well to clear away the buccinator muscle of one side in order to trace Stensen's duct, and to notice that it runs forwards a Uttle way between the muscle and mucous mem- brane before its opening is reached. A number of buccal mucous glands are embedded in the submucous tissue around its opening. THE TEMPORAL REGION The temporal fossa of the skull is that part which is bounded by the superior temporal ridge above and behind, by the malar bone in front, and by the zygoma below, and to all its margins the strong femj9orai/ascia is attached. _ The best way to appreciate this fascia is to make a vertical cut through it above the middle of the zygoma. Now, if the cut edge of the fascia be looked at, it will be seen to split

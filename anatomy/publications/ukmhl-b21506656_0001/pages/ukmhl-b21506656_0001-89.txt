69 INTRACRANIAL REGION dividing with great care, since they have not yet gained a sheath from the dura mater, and are easily torn. In cutting the fifth nerves notice the small motor root lying below the large sensory one. Continue to draw back the brain until the ahducens or sixth cranial nerve is seen on each side piercing the dura mater | inch behind the posterior clinoid process. Cut the sixth nerves and then look for the facial (seventh) and auditory (eighth) nerves, with the delicate pars inter- media nerve between them. Perhaps the little auditory branch of the basilar artery Avill be seen accompanying them. When these have been divided, the glosso-pharyngeal (ninth), the vagus {tenth), and the spinal accessory (eleventh cranial) nerves should be found. They pass through the posterior lacerated or jugular foramen in the skull, but nothing is seen of this as long as the dura mater is in posi- tion except two small holes, the anterior of which transmits the ninth and the posterior the tenth and eleventh nerves. It will be noticed that these three nerves pierce the dura mater from before back in the order in which they are numbered. Between the point at which these nerves pierce the dura mater and the foramen magnum is an elevation in the floor of the skull called the jugular tubercle. The ninth and tenth nerves pass outward across the top of this and some- times groove it, but the eleventh nerve will be seen arching up from the foramen magnum behind the tubercle. The ninth and tenth nerves should be cut, but the eleventh left untouched. The hypoglossal or tivelfth cranial nerve will be found as two bundles, often some distance apart, penetrating the dura mater below and internal to the exit of the eleventh. After these have been carefully divided, cut through the medulla at its junction with the spinal cord as nearly flush with the lower border of the foramen magnum as can be

260 PRACTICAL ANATOMY muscle, which rises from the rough area near the apex of the inferior surface of the petrous bone, and its tendon, turning outwards round the posterior free end of the processus cochleariformis, runs outwards across the tympanum, to be inserted into the root of the handle of the malleus. It Avill thus be seen that two tubes run forwards from the tympanum ; the upper small one for the tensor tympani, and the lower large one the Eustachian tube. Measure the bony part of the tube, and notice that it is rather less than half an inch long. Its floor is formed by the tympanic plate, and just internal to it lies the carotid canal (see Fig. 114, horizontal section). It is continued forwards into the cartilaginous part of the tube, Avhich has already been noticed, but now may be studied in longitudinal section; it is rather more than twice as long as the bony part, so that the whole tube is about If inch long. This cartilaginous part is a vertical slit, increasing rapidly in depth as the pharynx is approached. A transverse section of it will show that its roof and inner wall are cartilaginous, while its outer wall and floor are fibrous. Through it the mucous membrane of the pharynx is con- tinuous with that of the tympanum, and, as long as it is patent, air passes through it and equahses the atmospheric pressure on the two sides of the tympanic membrane. "When it becomes blocked, owing to acute or chronic inflammation of its mucous membrane, the air in the tympanum is absorbed and the tympanic membrane is bulged in by the pressure of the atmosphere outside it. This state of things, unless relieved, leads to permanent deafness. Notice that the tympanic opemng of the tube is consider- ably above the level of the floor of the tympanum. In the posterior wall of the tympanum the most import- ant thing is the opening from the attic into the mastoid antrum.

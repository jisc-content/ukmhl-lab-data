400 PKACTICAL ANATOMY between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius hallucis, and finally, between the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius hallucis, being crossed, just above its termination, by the tendon of the extensor proprius hal- lucis. In addition to the anterior tibial recivrrent and mus- cular branches, it gives off internal and external malleolar branches, which ramify over the internal and external malleoli respectively. In ligaturing this artery it is well to remember that in almost its whole course it lies close to the tibialis anticus, and that the outer edge of this muscle is the guide to the artery (see Fig. 171). The Anterior TihialNerve [n.peronaeus profundus] appears in the compartment by piercing the extensor longus digitorum just below the external tuberosity of the tibia. It lies first to the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, then in front of the artery, and lastly, to the outer side again. It leaves the compartment by passing downwards deep to the anterior annular ligament. It supplies the four muscles in the anterior tibio-fibular region. If now the extensor longus digitorum and the peroneus tertius be turned outwards, a small artery will often be seen piercing the interosseous membrane a little above the ankle-joint, and descending under cover of the latter muscle ; it is the anterior peroneal artery, and may be traced downwards to the region of the external malleolus, where it anastomoses with the external malleolar artery already mentioned. It will be readily understood that if the anterior peroneal artery is large, the external malleolar is likely to be small or absent, and vice versa. Peroneal Compaktment The transverse incisions already made at the level of the knee and ankle should now be carried round the outer surface of the leg. In the superficial fascia thus exposed branches from nerves already seen in part will be found; m the upper half, twigs from the cutaneous branch of the

GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING xv numerous enough. The writer makes them as he needs them of thick bent pins and fine waxed string. When two dissectors are working on one part, one of them can help the other greatly by retracting parts with a piece of copper-wire bent into a hook at its end. Probes and seekers are indispensable and should be of different sizes. The dissector who takes an interest in the technical part of his work will find all sorts of homely articles, such as knitting-needles, crotchet-hooks, &c., gradually adding themselves to his box of apparatus, and a use for each one will constantly turn up from time to time. Saws, chisels, and bone forceps of different patterns are provided in most dissecting-rooms, though, unfortunately, demonstrators do not always see that these are numerous enough or that they are replaced as they are worn out or broken. In the subsequent pages special attention is paid to the patterns which are most useful in different dissections. Finally, the education of the sense of touch is most important; structures may often be felt long before they are seen, and it is wonderful how easily a man with trained fingers will pick out the different vessels, nerves, and muscles in a dissection which he is not even looking at. The practice of finding the different parts of a dissection by touch alone is an amusing and very instructive exercise and lends a pleasant variety to the monotony of continual dissection. Whether dissecting is a bad training for a modern surgeon is a debatable point. In the old days of rapid amputations and orthodox incisions it no doubt often induced men to make three cuts where there should have been one, but in modern surgery the scalpel is used nearly as much and quite as delicately as in the dissecting-room; there is, however, one essential difference in the way in which it is used. On the living body the parts are exposed and cleaned by a series

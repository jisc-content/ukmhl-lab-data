PKACTICAL ANATOMY 202 The Lacritnal gland is about the size of a bean, and is usually completely surrounded by the orbital fat; the lacrimal nerve, however, leads to it. Clean it carefully, and notice that it consists of a larger upper and a smaller lower lobe. By gently drawing it up its minute ducts may be seen passing to the outer part of the upper fornix of the conjunctiva (see Fig. 98). The fowrth nerve (Trochlearis) will be found at the back of the orbit internal to the frontal, and may be traced forwards until it enters the upper (orbital) sur- face of the superior oblique muscle, which it does very soon. These three nerves—lacrimal, frontal, and trochlearis —are the only ones which enter the orbit above the muscles, and they lie in the order named from without inwards. The levator palpebrce superioris muscle rises above and internal to the optic foramen, and rapidly widens as it runs forwards to be inserted into the tarsal plate of the upper eyelid. Cut it across about its middle, and turn the hinder end backwards very gently to see its nerve supply, which comes from the oculo-motor (3rd) and pierces the superior rectus to reach it. The broad fascial sheet into which the anterior part expands is attached on each side to the anterior margins of the orbit, the external attachment going to a well- marked tubercle on the malar bone. A few fibres from its deep surface may be traced into the upper arch or fornix of the conjunctiva, while a few superficial ones lose themselves among the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum. The superior rectus rises just above the optic foramen, and runs forwards and outwards to the upper surface of the eyeball, where it is inserted into the sclerotic coat about one-third of an inch behind its junction Avith the cornea. A line drawn along the middle of the muscle passes internally to the vertical axis at the centre of the eyeball, and so the action of the superior rectus is to turn the eye up and in.

THE ORBiT 211 division of the third (3 a.), the nasal branch of the fifth (5 n.), and the ophthalmic artery (A.); below these the optic nerve (N.); and, finally, the lower division of the third (3 b.) and the sixth nerves. Arranged in a diagrammatic way the structures have this order:â€” 4, 5 (f. and 1.). M. 3 (a.),-5 (n.), A. N. 3 (b.), 6. Now cut the muscles which have not been already divided, and remove the eyeball to a vessel containing spirit and water, or formahn solution. The back of the orbit shows the optic foramen with the origins of the recti muscles round it; they rise from a fibrous ring, almost a tube, which is really nothing more than the four coalesced tendons of origin. The tube is interrupted by the fact that the external rectus rises by an upper head which is internal to the anterior lacerated foramen, and a lower which comes from the outer side, and in this way all the structures, coming through the anterior lacerated foramen, except the frontal, lacrimal and fourth nerves, are said to pass between the two heads of the external rectus. Below and outside the optic foramen the spheno- maxillary fissure hes. In the recent state very little is seen of it, because it is closed in by membrane continuous with the periosteum, excepting where the veins, nerves, and lymphatics go through it. The veins have been described already, the nerves are the infraorbital, and its orbital branch the temporo-malar. The infraorbital nerve, -or continuation of the second division of the fifth, is easily found running forward in a groove m the posterior part of the orbital floor, but as the front of the orbit is approached the groove becomes a canal which, a quarter of an inch behind the orbital margin turns

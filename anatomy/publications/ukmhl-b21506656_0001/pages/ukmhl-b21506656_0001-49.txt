THE SPINAL COED 29 Ventral the central canal of the cord only just visible to the naked eye. The uprights of the H form the anterior and posterior horns [columna anterior and posterior], of which the anterior are shorter and broader than the posterior. The posterior horns diverge somewhat and very nearly reach the surface of the cord at the postero-lateral sulcus. At their tips they have a trans- lucent appearance, due to the presence of the substantia gela- tinosa of Rolando, while at their bases they are rather broadened on their medial aspect, close to the grey commissure, by a column of cells best marked in this region and known as the posterior vesi- ctdar or Clarke's column [nucleus dorsalis]. Notice that the anterior horns do not nearly reach the surface of the cord, and that, although they are distinctly broader than the posterior, they are not more than twice as broad. The white matter surrounds the grey, and is mapped out into various tracts, which do not concern us here, since they are not visible to the naked eye and depend on embryo- logical, pathological, and experimental evidence for their determination. The anterior and posterior r)iedian fissures, however, are visible, and it will be noticed how much broader though shallower the former is than the latter. On looking at the anterior median fissure carefully, the reduplication of the pia mater into it is evident. At its bottom it does not reach the grey commissure, but leaves room for the white matter to communicate across the mid line, thus forming the white commissure.

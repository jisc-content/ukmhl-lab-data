THE HIP-JOINT 391 which will then become evident. Now open the joint by a vertical iEcision through the anterior half of the capsule. This will show the real thickness of the ilio-femoral liga- ment, which is greater at times than that of the tendo Achillis. If the ligament is followed towards the femur between the finger and thumb, it will usually be felt to divide into an upper and lower thickened part diverging like Fig. 167.-^Hip-joint from Behind.

For this reason it is often known as the " Y-shaped ligament." On looking into the interior a more or less cylindrical band, the ligamentum teres, will be observed passing from the bottom of the acetabulum to a pit on the head of the femur. This ligament is usually torn in any dislocation. By a vertical sweep of the knife through the posterior half of the capsule complete the circular incision, divide the liga- mentum teres near its femoral attachment and remove the limb. If the inside of the femoral half of the capsule be examined, its fibres will be seen to be reflected along the neck of the femur from their attachment in the form of

PEEFACE We began this book with the idea of leaving out as many facts of Anatomy as we dared, because we felt that the modern medical student, with only some fifteen months at his disposal, could not be expected to master the whole ot Anatomy or to exercise any sound choice as to which parts of it he should neglect. As the work went on we found that some of the tacts which we had omitted were valued by other teachers, and so they were replaced; a,nd although there is still a great deal of anatomical knowledge purposely omitted from this book, we hope that it will be found to include all that is necessary for the use of students. The omission of comparatively unimportant detail has rendered small and large type unnecessary, we think. In any case, we are glad to be without small type, because, in our experience, students usually pay more attention to the minutiae contained in it than they do to the essential facts embodied in the large print. The question of nomenclature has given us much anxious thought, and we have come to the conclusion that the time is not ripe for the exclusive adoption of the revised anato- mical nomenclature. We do not dare, for instance, to send a student into the wards understanding that the radial nerve is a structure in the upper arm, when, to his surgeon, it is a structure in the forearm. There is little doubt, however, that the new nomenclature Avill gradually assert itself, and we have gladly placed the modern name in square brackets

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 54 Superficial to the mastoid process are one or two small mastoid nodes [Lymphoglandulse auriculares posteriores] draining tlie posterior auricular region, while the posterior part of the scalp drains into the occipital nodes already seen (see p. 2). The vessels and nerves having been traced and sketched, the muscles of the scalp should be studied. The anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis (frontalis) muscle has been cut already in its lower part. Now cut it right across on one side of the forehead and turn it forward; this will show that it has no bony attach- ments, but merely blends with the orbicularis palpebrarum above the orbit. Near the mid line, however, it is pro- longed do^vn the root of the nose as the pyramidalis nasi. The posterior belly or occipitalis has been dissected already (see p. 3). There is a considerable interval between the occipitales muscles of opposite sides, and here the aponeurosis reaches back to the curved line while the two frontales converge and touch one another near the root of the nose. The frontales muscles cause the horizontal wrinkles of the forehead. Watch these appearing in a living person, and note that the skin of the forehead is pulled up, not down, in their formation; this shows that the muscles act from the aponeurosis. Note too that the wrinkles are not really horizontal, but that there is a downward convexity in the mid line, because the frontales do not meet in the mid line until the root of the nose is reached. Divide the aponeurosis (epicranitim), joining the occipitaHs to the frontahs by a transverse cut, and turn part of it back. This will show how thin the membrane is and how loosely it is bound down to the subjacent periosteum by strands of areolar tissue running across the subaponeurotic lymph space. It will now be easily understood that any subaponeurotic collection of fluid (blood or pus) will not be localised, but will soon make its way to the most dependent points.

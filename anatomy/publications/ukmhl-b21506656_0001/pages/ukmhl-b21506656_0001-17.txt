GENERAL HINTS ON DISSECTING xiii . they are interfered with. A good big note-book should be kept, together with a box of coloured pencils, and a pair of compasses for recording sizes and distances accurately. The note-book, of course, will get disgracefully dirty, but that is quite a small matter; the work, too, takes time, and is at first laborious and difficult, but in no other way are the details impressed on the memory so accurately or is the eye attracted by points which would otherwise escape notice. Moreover, when once the superficial structures have been drawn they may be reflected and replaced in their normal positions at will. It is not always necessary to clean the whole surface of a large muscle; its origin and insertion must be definitely determined, the general direction of its fibres noted, and the point of entry of its nerve or nerves found, but a perfect museum specimen of it cannot be hoped for. When once a muscle has been sketched it may safely be cut and its deep surface and relations examined. In making a deep dissection one of the greatest difficulties is to prevent the more superficial arteries and nerves being cut by that part of the knife-blade which is near the handle while the dissector's attention is concentrated on the point. To avoid this one of the writers has arranged that each of his students shall have several of his knives specially blunted to within a quarter of an inch of the point. This means that there is only a quarter of an inch of edge to look after, and the damage likely to be done to superficial parts is trifling. The reason why many students make such poor work of their dissecting is that they never have a sharp Icnife. A knife which is really sharp will, after an hour's hard dissect- ing, be quite dull. Every dissector should have his own strop, on which he should strop his loiife every ten minutes and when this fails to bring up the edge the hone must be used.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 276 The auditory artery is not very often injected; its branches pass in with the different nerves to all parts of the internal ear. Now measure the depth of the internal auditory meatus, and notice that it is about a quarter of an inch. Review of the Labyeinth oe Inteenal Eae Hitherto it has been the practice in this book to mention only those things Avhich the student can see for himself in the dissecting-room, but in the case of the internal ear it seems advisable to link up those things which have been seen with those of which only glimpses have been obtained, and so, while the main landmarks are fresh in the memory, try to get a bird's-eye view of this intricate part. It must be clearly understood that the membranous labyrinth, of which so little has been seen, is the part of physiological importance, and that this labyrinth Hes in, though it seldom fits, the bony spaces which have been examined in detail. Between the membranous and bony labyrinth lies the perilymph, while the membranous labyrinth itself is filled with endolymph. The anterior part of the membranous labyrinth is coiled up in the cochlea as the scala media, while the scala vestibuli and scala tympani contain perilymph. The bony vestibule contains two membranous bags, the saccule in front and the utricle behind, while the saccule is connected with the scala media in front by a narrow membranous tube called the canalis reuniens. The saccule is connected with the utricle by a tube, which is Y-shaped, and known as the ductus endolymphaticus, the stalk of the V projecting backward into the aqueductus vesti- buH on the posterior surface of the petrous bone, its bhnd end Ivine in contact with the dura mater. From the utricle open backward the three membranous

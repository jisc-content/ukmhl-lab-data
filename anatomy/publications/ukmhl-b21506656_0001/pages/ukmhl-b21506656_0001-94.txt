PRACTICAL ANATOMY 74 It will be seen that tlie sinus gets its name from a number of filaments which run across it and form cavernous tissue. The carotid artery and the nerves will be recognised lying in this tissue, but each surrounded by an endothelial sheath. The inner wall is hardly present, and a seeker will show that the blood space is continuous with the so-called cir- cular simts [S. circularis], which fills up all that part of Diaph.Sel.

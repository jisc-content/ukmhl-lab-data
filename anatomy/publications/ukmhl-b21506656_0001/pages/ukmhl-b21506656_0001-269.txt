THE EAR 249 When the shape and direction of these joint surfaces have been studied on the dry bones it will be evident that those between the occiput and atlas are adapted to a nodding movement of the head, while those between the atlas and axis act as guides in the rotatory movement of shaking the head which occurs here, and to which the odontoid process of the axis acts as a pivot. This atlo-axial joint should now be examined, since, although the section has passed transversely through it, the parts may easily be replaced. Notice how the convex ' articular surface on the front of the odontoid process fits against the facet on the anterior arch of the atlas, and how the back of the odontoid process becomes somewhat con- stricted to form a neck where the transverse ligament rests against it. Notice, too, that there is a synovial capsule in front of and behind the odontoid process, but none at the sides. This atlo-axial joint is a good example of the pivot, trochoid or lateral ginglymus variety of the diarthrodial jomts. THE EAR The ear is divided into three parts—external, middle, and internal. A knowledge of the topography of these is essential to the study of the physiology of hearing, but, in addition to this, the parts are so liable to disease, and so frequently the site of surgical interference, that, although this is usually the last part of the head and neck to be dissected, its examination should on no account be neglected or hurried over. As in the study of the brain, the dissectors of opposite sides should agree to work together and adopt different methods of exposing the two sides. The pinna has already been studied before it dried up (see p. 56), so that the external auditory meatus is the part to begin with. External Auditory Meatus [meatus acusticus externus]. —On looking into this tube, its general direction will be seen

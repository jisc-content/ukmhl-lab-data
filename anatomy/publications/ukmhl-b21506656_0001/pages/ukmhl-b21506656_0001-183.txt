THE NECK 163 from the supraclavicular nodes in the lower part of the posterior triangle. Both these ducts may with care be identified. The next thing to look for is the origin of the internal mammary artery which comes off opposite that of the thyroid axis and runs downwards and inwards behind the formation of the innominate vein and a little outside the position of the sterno-clavicular articulation. At its origin it is usually crossed obliquely by the phrenic nerve, which is here lying behind the innominate vein at its formation and in front of the internal mammary artery. If possible, an arrangement should be made with the dissectors of the thorax to display the whole course of the artery. As soon as the pleural cavity has been opened, a finger should be passed up into its dome, and it will then be felt that the pleura covers both the lower and posterior surfaces of the first part of the subclavian artery as well as the posterior surface of the internal mammary (see Fig. 80). The posterior relations of the common carotid artery must now be resumed. The nerves which lie behind the common carotid are the vagus, the sympathetic, and, on the right side, the recurrent laryngeal. The course of the vagus with its cardiac branches has been studied in part (see p. 98), and may be now followed right up to the skull. Above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery it lies between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, and, as the level of the atlas is approached, is in close relation to the hypoglossal nerve. Here it shghtly enlarges to form the ganglion of the trunk [ganglion nodosum], which is often nearly an inch long, and receives a communication from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. On looking at the base of a dried skull it will be noticed that the anterior condylar foramen [canalis hypoglossi], through which the hypoglossal nerve emerges, lies internal to the jugular foramen, which gives exit to the vagus amona

19 THE SPINAL CORD Begin the cut in the upper lumbar region where it is most easily made, and as soon as two or three laminae are cut through on each side raise them by dividing the liga- mentum subflavum between the third and fourth lumbar laminae. Now fix the chain hooks firmly into the raised neural arches, and let one dissector forcibly retract them toward the head, while the other with the bone forceps and saw divides the rest, one after another. In this way it is easy to see how much cutting is required, and there is very little risk of injuring the dura mater. With care the work may be carried right up to the atlas without injuring any of the spiiaal nerves. The lower lumbar and sacral laminaj may then be removed until the whole length of the spinal dura mater is exposed. This latter part of the work is, in our experience, best done with the chisel, though different manipulators find that they can work best with different implements. The elastic ligamenta subfiava [LI. flava] should be ex- amined ; they join the laminas together and end laterally at the articular processes, where they form the inner part of the capsular ligament. In order to expose completely the dura mater, some fat and the dorsal or posterior part of the extradural venous plexus [plexus venosi vertebrales interni] must be cleared away. Finally, the posterior arch of the atlas should be divided on each side with bone forceps, where the vertebral artery is grooving it, and the piece carefully removed. The next stage, after noticing the cylindrical bag which the dura mater forms, is to lay it open in its whole length from the foramen magnum to its pointed termination oppo- site the second or third sacral vertebra. This should be done by a median dorsal incision, but great care must be taken not to injure the delicate arachnoid which lies quite close to its deep surface. The best plan is for each dissector to take a pair of forceps and hold up the membrane after

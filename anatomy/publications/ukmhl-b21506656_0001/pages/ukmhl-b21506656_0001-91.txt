INTRACRANIAL REGION 71 sectino- room, but can attempt should be made by lifting the olfactory bulb which was left on the cribriform plate of one side to expose them. They are very numerous, but so fine and soft that they ofler no resistance to raising the bulb, and it is only for an instant, as they are stretched before snapping, that they can be caught sight of. It will be noticed that the first and second cranial nerves pierce the dura mater at practically the same point as that at which they leave the skull. The same thing is true for the seventh to the twelfth nerves mclusive, but from the third , to the sixth they have an intradural course, often of considerable length, which should be investigated next. It is most convenient to begin with the fifth nerve which passes through an oval aperture in the dura mater just above the apex of the petrous bone and below the attach- ment of the tentorium. This opening leads into a definite ante-room in the dura mater, known as Meckel's Cave. Explore this cavity with a seeker, slit it open, and notice how in it the sensory branch of the fifth expands into a flattened swelling, known as the Gasserian ganglion [G. semi-lunarej (see Fig. 35). From the distal side of this ganglion three large nerves come off, giving the swelling the appearance of a three- pronged fork, the lateral prongs of which are splayed out. The inner and upper of these three nerves is the first or ophthalmic division of the fifth [N. ophthalmicus]; the middle is the second or maxillary division [N. maxillaris]; while the outer and lower is the third or mandibular division [N. mandibularis], and each of them as it leaves the gang- lion receives a strong and intimate sheath from the dura mater. On lifting up the trunk of the fifth nerve with the ganglion, it will be seen that the small motor root [portio minor] only joins the third division, so that neither of the others can possibly supply any muscles.

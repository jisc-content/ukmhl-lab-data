THE TIBIO-FIBULAR JOINTS 439 Notice that tlio fibula is bound, to the tibia by the superior, middle, and inferior tibio-fibular articulations. In the superior tihio-fibular joint the head of the fibula is bound to the external tuberosity 6f the tibia by strong anterior and posterior ligaments which allow only slight gliding between the two cartilage-covered surfaces; this, therefore, is a good example of the arthrodial or gliding joint. Notice that the tendon of the popliteus passes close behind this articulation, so that the bursa accompanying the tendon and derived from the knee-joint sometimes opens into the tibio-fibular joint. When this is the case the superior tibio-fibular joint, of course, communicates indirectly with the loiee. The middle tibio-fibular joint is simply the interosseous membrane which runs downwards and outwards from the tibia to the fibula. It is wanting for a short distance above and below where the anterior tibial and anterior peroneal arteries pass through. The inferior tibio-fibular joint is what is known as a syndesmosis, that is, the opposed bony surfaces are bound together in almost their Avhole extent by fibrous tissue, and are not covered by a layer of articular cartilage as they would be in a symphysis. There is also a strong anterior and posterior inferior tibio fibular ligament [lig. malleoli lateralis] joining the bones, so that they are hardly ever torn away from one another during life. If the posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament is carefully cut through, another ligament—the inferior transverse—is seen joining the two bones deep to it; this completes the socket for the astragalus, and the bevelled postero-external border of that bone plays against it. The Ankle-joint The capsule of this joint is divided into anterior and posterior and external and internal lateral ligaments.

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 154 with the 9th, 10th, and 11th cranial nerves, lie just internal to the part which was occupied by the post-styloid lobe (Fig. 73). A final review of the Parotid Gland will show that its shape is that of an inverted pyramid, having four surfaces, a base, and an apex. Of the surfaces the anterior is grooved for the mandible, the posterior for the mastoid process and sterno-mastoid muscle, while the internal has an oblique groove for the styloid process. The apex is at the angle of the jaw, and is separated from the submaxillary gland by the stylo-mandihular ligament. DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK In order to see the deep parts of the neck clearly the inner end of the clavicle should be removed, and, before this is done, the opportunity must be seized of examining the joint between it and the sternum. Notice that the sterno-claviculak articulation has a capsule, of which the anterior part is the thickest, and con- sists of fibres running downwards and inwards, while the two clavicles are joined together above the manubrium by the interclavicular ligament, the lower fibres of which blend with the upper part of each capsule. Pull up the outer cut end of the clavicle and look for the costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament running downwards and inwards from the inner part of the lower surface of its shaft to the first rib cartilage. Notice that the outer end of the clavicle can be elevated or depressed, pulled forwards or pushed backwards, and rotated, though very slightly, on its long axis. For all practical purposes, the only movements which take place within the capsule are slight ghding ones, and so the joint is said to belong to the subdivision of the Arthrodia or gliding joints and to the main division of Diarthroses or movable joints. Now cut through the capsule from above, keeping close

THE NECK 39 vexity outwards from there to the middle of the lower edge of the clavicle. This part of the artery really ends at the outer border of the first rib, so that the whole of it is not seen in this dissection however much the arm is pulled down. As this is the first large artery met with in the dissection of the head and neck, the writer may here point out the advantage of adopting a system in observing and afterwards recalling relations. A list of the more important kinds of structures should be run through for each aspect of the artery and, after the relations have been once carefully observed, the mere mention of the kind of structure will probably suggest the actual relation with very little mental effort. Under no circumstances should a student attempt to learn the relations of arteries by heart from a book; they should be looked at and thought out until they become real images in the mind. Relations are either direct or indirect; the former are actually m contact, the latter nearly, but not quite, so. Logical accuracy in these details must not be hoped for, because, strictly speaking, the only direct relation of most arteries is the cellular tissue surrounding them. Again, relations may change with change in the position of a part, so that when the relations of an artery or other structure are asked for in an examination it is usually with the view of giving the candidate a chance of showing his knowledge of the relative positions of the more important structures. Applying these remarks to the third part of the sub- clavian artery the following relations will be found:— In Front.—(The body always supposed to be in the erect position.) Bones.—Clavicle. MtscZes.—Platysma, Omo-hyoid (sometimes), Subclavius (Avhen the arm is raised).

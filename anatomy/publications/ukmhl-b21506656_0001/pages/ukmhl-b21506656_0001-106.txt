PRACTICAL ANATOMY 86 noticed too that cellular tissue, when dissected away from its attachments, condenses into an artificial sheet which is not present at all during life. Just above the suprasternal notch the cellular tissue is very plentiful and is known as Burns "space." Here the ensheathing layer of the deep cervical fascia is said to split, though no evidence of any such thing is present in a median section unless it has been specially prepared to show it. Above, the deep cervical fascia is usually described as being attached to the lower jaw, the hyoid bone, and, by spHtting, to form a bag in which the parotid gland is lodged, while below it is attached to the clavicle. This description is true enough except that it suggests a sharp distinction between the deep fascia, the superficial fascia, and the intermuscular septa, whereas all these struc- tures are quite continuous and all consist of cellular tissue containing more or less fat. Now clear away this tissue in the lower part of the anterior triangle, and so expose the lower of the three small triangles into which it is subdivided. This is called the Musculae Triangle, and its boundaries are the mid line of the neck in front, the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid above, and the edge of the sterno-mastoid behind (see Fig. 43). The omo-hyoid can be readily recognised by pulling on its posterior belly already exposed in the posterior triangle; it runs downwards and outwards from the lower border of the hyoid bone, at the junction of its body and great cornu, to disappear deep to the sterno-mastoid about the level of the cricoid cartilage. Clear the cellular tissue away from the upper part of the anterior triangle and define the ^?os- terior belly of the digastric muscle. This runs from the mastoid process to the base of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. As it nears the hyoid it narrows into its central tendon, which usually pierces the stylo-hyoid muscle. Whether it does so or not the stylo-

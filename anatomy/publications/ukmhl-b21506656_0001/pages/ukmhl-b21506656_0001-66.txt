46 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The suprascapular nerve then runs outwards and down- wards above the level of the rest of the plexus (see Fig. 19). It may be worth while to insist once more on the fact that the suprascapular nerve, the suprascapular artery, and the omo-hyoid muscle converge on the suprascapular notch; while the nerve to the rhomboids, the posterior scapular artery, and the levator anguli scapulae muscle converge on the upper angle of the scapula. When the posterior scapular artery rises from the third part of the subclavian, it usually passes between the trunks or cords of the plexus. THE SCALP Now that the body is on its back the student will see how diflficult it is to reach the occipital region satisfactorily, and he will appreciate the advantage of having dissected this part already. Before bewinninsr the actual dissection the followincr landmarks should be carefully identified:— A. Median Landmarks 1. Nasion.—The mid point of the naso-frontal suture at the root of the nose. 2. Bregma.—Easily localised by passing a piece of string vertically across the head from a point just in front of one ear to the other; a slight depression is sometimes felt at this site. 3. External Occiintal Protuberance [protuberantia occi- pitalis externa].—At the junction of the scalp and neck; often difficult to feel in females. 4. Lambda.—The point at which the parietal and occi- pital bones meet in the mid line about a hand's-breadth (2| to 3 inches) above the external occipital protuberance. Here, too, a slight depression may sometimes be felt.

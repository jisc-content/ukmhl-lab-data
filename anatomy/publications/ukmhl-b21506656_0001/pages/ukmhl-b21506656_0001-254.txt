PRACTICAL ANATOMY 234 so turns the vocal processes outwards and separates the vocal cords (see Fig. 105). â€¢ The crico-arytenoideus lateralis should be loolced for just below the thryo-arytenoideus. It rises from the upper border of the lateral part of the ring of the cricoid (see Fig. 107), and its fibres run back to the front of the mus- cular process of the arytenoid cartilage, which it thus draws forwards, and so turns the vocal process inwards, thus approximating the cords (see Fig. 105). In this way it acts as the antagonist of the crico- arytenoideus posticus, though when these two muscles con- tract at the same time they neutralise one another's rotating poAver, draw the arytenoid cartilage away from its fellow, and so become antagonists of the arytenoideus. The distribution of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve should now be traced on the hitherto un- dissected side. This is the sensory nerve of the larynx, which it enters by piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane a little in front of the upper cornu of the thyroid cartilage (see Fig. 107). The membrane should not be interfered with, but the nerve picked up after it has passed through. To do this make the nerve tense with hooks and dissect through the mucous membrane forming the floor of the sinus pyriformis. Some twigs may be followed upwards and inwards to the epiglottis and back of the tongue, while others run down to supply the rest of the mucous membrane of the larynx as low as the true vocal cords. With a little care a communication may be traced to the branch of the recurrent laryngeal which supplies the arytenoideus muscle. The thyro-hyoid membrane [M. hyothyreoidea] should now be examined; it consists of a central part running from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone and more posteriorly to the inner border of the great cornu.

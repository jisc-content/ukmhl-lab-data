61 INTRACRANIAL REGION : in cappearance, may be seen, whicLi lead from the lacunce I laterales, creek-like openings into the main stream, Avhich bear very much the same relation to the superior longi- I tudinal sinus that the Norfolk Broads do to their rivers. , Lay open some of these lacuna3 and look for Pacchionian I bodies [Granulationes arachnoideales] projecting into their I cavity ; these are masses of hypertrophied villous outgrowths of the arachnoid membrane which push their way through : the dura mater into the lacuna. With care they may be . withdrawn, and then the floor of the lacuna has a delicate pattern of minute perforations. When they grow large : enough they make depressions in the inner table of the ! frontal.and parietal bones. They are usually found near the superior longitudinal sinus, and are better marked in old than in young people. NoAV make two incisions parallel with the superior longitudinal sinus, one on either side of it. From the centre of each of these make another cut out- wards at right angles, and carry it as far as possible; then turn the four flaps aside. This opens up the subdural space [cavum subdurale] between the smooth inner surface of the dura mater and the outer surface of the arachnoid, a membrane which is so transparent that the convolutions of the brain, as Avell as the cerebral arteries and veins, are seen easily through it. The last of these turn forwards before entering the lacunse laterales or superior longitudinal sinus. The further steps depend on the condition of the brain; if it is obviously useless, it is better to clear it away piece- meal, leaving the dura mater with its various folds in position. In this event a fresh brain may usually be obtained elsewhere. In most bodies injected with formalin, however, the brain is already moderately hard, and may be removed Avithout difficulty. It should be understood that in life the subdural space

THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION 141 passes deep to the lingual nerve, which will be seen running downwards and forwards from the superficial surface of the internal pterygoid muscle (see Fig. 67). By detaclaing the insertion of this muscle from the inner surface of the mandible, between the inferior dental foramen and the angle, the whole course of the lingual nerve from the ■ foramen ovale to the submaxillary region will be displayed. Notice that it lies between the jaw and the mucous membrane of the mouth. If a finger is pressed back between the tongue and the mandible, about an inch below and behind the last molar tooth, in a living person, the nerve will be reached and the pressure readily felt. Here it may be divided from inside the mouth to reheve pain in cancer of the tongue. In the angle which the duct and the lingual nerve make just before they cross one another, the submaxillary ganglion lies ; it hangs from the lingual by two roots, and is generally quite easy to find. Nerves from it may easily be traced into the submaxillary gland. The Hypoglossal Nerve may be cleaned as it runs for- wards a little way above the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and a well-marked branch running downwards and forwards to the genio-hyoid muscle as well as another running upwards and backwards to the stylo-glossus muscle looked for. Running parallel and quite close to the hypoglossal nerve, the ranine vein [V. comitans, N. hypoglossi] is often seen; it may be double, but is often absent altogether. The whole surface of the hyo-glossus muscle is now exposed, rising from the outer border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone and also slightly from the body, where it dovetails into the insertion of the genio-hyoid. Its fibres run upwards and forwards to the tongue, and its relations, which are very important, should be reviewed. The superficial relations of the hyo-glossus are (see Fig. G8)— 1. -Bones.—The lower Jaw at some little distance.

PBACTICAL ANATOMY 58 The stiffness of the pinna is now seen to be due to a framework of fibro-cartilage which is continuous with that in the walls of the external auditory meatus, and reproduces, with a few points of difference, the contour of the surface of the pinna. The chief point of difference is that the lobule consists of fibro-fatty material and contains no cartilage. Another is that the cartilage of the helix ends below in Eminence of Eminence of fossa of Outer Surface. Inner Surface. Figs. 27 and 28.â€”Cartilage and Mdscles of the Pinna. a tail-like process known as the caxida helieis, which can be easily felt in the ear of a living person. At the anterior part of the cartilage of the helix, just below the point at which the ear joins the head, is the spina helieis, to which a strong ligament, binding it to the head, is attached. That part of the cartilage which supports the tragus and is continued into the auditory meatus is nearly separated from the rest by a very deep terminal notch [incisiira terminalis], while in the anterior part of this cartilage, which is sharply bent in towards the meatus, there is the fissure of Santorini.

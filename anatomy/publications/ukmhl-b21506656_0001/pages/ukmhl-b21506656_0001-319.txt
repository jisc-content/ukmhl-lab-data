299 THE BRAIN The specimen should be held in such a way that the front of the half medulla and pons is facing the observer and is vertical. Look at the half from which the medulla has been removed and identify the cut cerebellar peduncles, the flocculus, and the vertical part of the upper worm. Notice, too, the superior medullary velum and trace it laterally to the superior cerebellar peduncle ; this may easily be done on the intact side. It will now be quite evident (1) that this velum forms the roof of the upper half of the diamond-shaped fourth ventricle ; (2) that it is triangular in shape ; (3) that its sides are attached to the superior cerebellar peduncles ; (4) that its base is attached to the cerebellum between the front ends of the upper and lower worms ; while (5) its apex just reaches the inferior quadrigeminal bodies between the converging superior cerebellar peduncles. The inferior medullary velum is a much more delicate structure than the superior, though, like it, consisting of white matter. Draw the medulla gently away from the cere- bellum, and look for the roof of the lower part of the fourth ventricle. On the ventricular surface (anteriorly) it is obscured by the woolly-looking choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, but its cerebellar (posterior) surface may be easily drawn away from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum by stroking it gently with a seeker. It will be seen that this part of the roof, which is here formed by the inferior medullary velum, joins the superior medullary velum, and is attached with it to the cerebellum between the anterior ends of the upper and lower Avorms, thus resembling the apex of a tent. Laterally, the inferior velum passes out to the flocculus, and its line of attachment is very easily seen on the side from which the medulla has been removed, as a stalk running from the flocculus to the front of the inferior worm, just below the cut cerebellar peduncles and above the tonsil.

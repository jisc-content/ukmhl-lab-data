PRACTICAL ANATOMY 28 begin as branches of the vertebral. These anterior and posterior spinal arteries are only the main stems of a delicate peripheral arterial plexus which is reinforced along the nerve roots by delicate radicular branches given off from the vertebral, intercostal and first lumbar arteries. This plexus needs very fine injecting to show it up, and is accompanied by an equally delicate peripheral venous plexus draining into radicular veins. In the mid line behind is the posterior median sulcus [sulcus medianus posterior], which, unlike the anterior, marks a mere septum, and has no reduplication of pia mater in it. BetAveen it and the postero-lateral sulcus look for a delicate linear depression, best marked in the upper part of the cord, called the paramedian sulcus [sulcus in- termedins posterior], and indicating the separation of the columns of Goll and Burdach in the white matter of the cord. In distinguishing the front fi-om the back of a spinal cord removed from the body, the following points should be specially attended to :â€” 1. If the spinal nerves are long enough to show the ganglia on the posterior roots, the matter is settled at once. 2. The hnea splendens on the front of the cord. ^ . 3. The single anterior spinal and double posterior spinal arteries. 4. The posterior nerve roots coming off in a single hue from the postero-lateral sulcus, while the anterior form a double line. This needs very close observation. Now make a transverse section of the cord in the mid thoracic region; this is its narrowest part, and here it is practically circular, having a diameter of about 10 mm. Notice that the grey matter is enclosed in the white and has the appearance of an H, the crossbar of which is nearer the front of the cord. This crossbar is the grey commissicre [C. anterior grisea], and is divided into anterior and posterior parts by

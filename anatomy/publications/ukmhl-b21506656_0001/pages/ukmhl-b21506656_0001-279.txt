259 THE MIDDLE EAR in a depression, in which the footplate of the stapes will almost certainly be found fitting in one at least of the two sections, bound to the margins of the opening by the annular membrane. Above the fenestra ovalis, and therefore still more above the promontory, is the aqueduct of Fallopius [canalis facialis], containing the facial nerve ; it forms a ridge, the wall of which is so thin that the nerve can be seen through it. As it is lying above the fenestra ovalis, it, together with the external semicircular canal, forms the inner boundary of the aditus or opening into the mastoid antrum. This relationship is most important, and must be borne in mind in any operative interference, such as using a sharp spoon in this neighbourhood. The immense difference between the practical importance of a structure like the tympanic plexus, on the one hand, and the aqueduct of Fallopius with its facial nerve, on the other, cannot be too strongly impressed upon the student. Ignorance or forgetfuhiess of the former matters little, but ignorance or forgetfulness of the latter may mean facial paralysis to the patient. Just behind the fenestra ovalis the aqueduct turns down, and now becomes embedded in the posterior wall of the tympanum. Below and behind the promontory, and directly below the fenestra ovahs, is the fenestra rotunda [f. cochlea], closed by the secondary membrane of the tympanum. The anterior wall of the tympanum has, as has been seen, the bony part of the Eustachian tube opening from it. If the inner half of the left side be looked at, it will be seen that there is a thin plate of bone which separates the Eustachian tube from a small canal above it. This plate is the processus cochleariformis, and, when undamao-ed, stretches back above the promontory, nearly as far as''the fenestra ovalis (see Fig. 117). In the small canal above it lies the tensor tympani

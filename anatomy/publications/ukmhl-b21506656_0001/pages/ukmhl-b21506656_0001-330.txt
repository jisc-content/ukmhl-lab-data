310 PRACTICAL ANATOMY fornix may be traced downwards and backwards into the corpus albicans of its own side. Here it seems to twist itself into a knot and to run up in the substance of the optic thalamus as the yery distinct bundle of Vicq d'Azyr [fasci- culus thalamo-mammillaris], which recedes into the substance of the thalamus as it ascends. There is, however, a break between the two bundles of fibres in the corpus albicans, though it is not evident to the naked eye (see Fig. 138). The best method of exposure is to scrape the thalamus away with a blunt knife, when the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr may be traced as high as the level of the stria pinealis. Convolutions of the Medial Sueface Surrounding the convex surface of the corpus callosum is the callosal fissure [sulcus corporis callosi], which separates that commissure from the callosal gyrus [g. cmguli] (see Fig 138 L.L.). This gyrus begins below the rostrum ot the corpus callosum and curves round its genu, body, and splenium. Below the latter it narrows to form the ^sthmus which connects it with the gyrus hippocampi, a convolution running forwards into the temporal lobe as far as the uncus and below the optic thalamus (see Fig. 139, H.G.). In order to see all the relations of this region, the lower and back part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle, including the pineal body, superior corpus quadngeminum, and crus cerebri should be carefully sliced away on one side This allows the posterior pillar of the fornix to be traced downwards and forwards into the tip of the uncus or hook In this part of its course the posterior pillar is known as the '/it tlowlhelLria, between it and the hippocampal crjruB, is a narrow strand of grey matter with a crinkled o foothed appearance. This is the dentate gyrus and is separaU from the hippocampal gyrus by the dentaUfi.s.re (Fig. 139, G.r>. and D.F.).

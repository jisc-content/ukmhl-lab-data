PRACTICAL ANATOMY 160 of the outer cusp is the commonest place for the opening of the thoracic duct on the left side (see Fig. 79). In more than 50 per cent, of all cases this duct is double for some little way before its termination. Sometimes the two parts join again before their opening, at others they open separately, and then the second aperture may be above or below the point named. This duplication of the duct is probably of considerable importance in operative surgery, because, if one is accidentally cut, the other will still carry the chyle into the veins. Directly below the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins is the usual point of opening of the vertebral vein, while in the subclavian vein, about an inch outside its junction with the internal jugular, is another well-marked bicuspid valve. Turn the cut internal jugular down and look for the ver- tebral vein which lies directly behind it. This vem comes out of the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and generally passes in front of the thoracic duct, which, if it has not already been seen on the left side, must be looked for very carefully now. The vein often re- ceives, near its termination, the intercostal vein from the first space (highest intercostal), though this sometimes opens mto the innominate. Behind the internal jugular, which has been turned down, is the first part of the subclavian artery, differing somewhat on the two sides. On the right its origin from the innomi- nate will be seen behind the sterno-clavicular articulation, but on the left the carotid and subclavian are separate branches of the arch of the aorta. In front of this part of the artery look for the vagus and jphremc nerves. iHe former runs down quite close to the carotid artery, and so passes in front of the inner end of the first part of the sub- clavian ; indeed, on the left side the vagus is rather an anterior relation of the subclavian in the thorax than m the neck.

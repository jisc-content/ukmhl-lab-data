PRACTICAL ANATOMY 112 mouth. Keep it and study its termination after the bucci- nator is dissected (p. 119). Just above it there is usually a small separate lobe of the parotid, known as the Soda Faro- tidis [Gl. parotis accessoria]. Running parallel to and above the duct is the Transverse facial artery, a branch of the superficial temporal. The buccal branches of the facial nerve [rami buccales] are found in a line running from the lower part of the auditory meatus to the angle of the mouth; they supply the buccinator and the orbicularis oris, and freely communicate with the Lo7ig Buccal Nerve from the third division of the fifth on the surface of the buccinator muscle. In order to expose these nerves fully it will probably be found that a thin layer of muscle running directly backwards from the angle of the mouth, and known as the Bisorius, must be reflected. This is the uppermost part of the platysma, and in reflecting it care must be taken not to injure the facial vein which lies on its deep surface. The long buccal nerve [N. buccinatorius] may now be found deeply placed on the surface of the buccinator and running downwards and forwards from under cover of the ramus of the jaw and masseter, half-way down its anterior border. It supphes the skui superficial to and the mucous membrane deep to the buccinator (B.S.N., Fig. 52). The mandibular branch of the facial nerve [ramus margi- nalis mandibulae] runs from the parotid gland forwards, along the surface of the lower jaw, to supply the muscles of the chin and to join twigs of the mental branch of the fifth [N. â€¢mentalis]. The cervical branch of the facial nerve [ramus colbj may just be seen passing down into the neck close to the angle of the jaw. It has already been seen in the neck The Muscles of Expkession, to which the branches of the facial nerve pass, should next be made out. _ The Orbicularis Palpebrarum [M. orbicularis ocuhj consists of an orbital and a palpebral portion, the former

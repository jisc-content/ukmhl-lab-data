204 PRACTICAL ANATOMY At this stage it will be well to start the dissection of the right orbit, but instead of removing all the roof and much of the outer wall, as has been done on the left side, leave a narrow bridge of bone at the anterior orbital margin, and do not remove the roof of the anterior lacerated foramen. This orbit, although it will be harder to dissect than the other, Fio. 98.â€”Dissection of Left Orbit from in front. S.O.N. Supraorbital Nerve. L.P.S.

It rises just internal to the origin of the levator palpebrse and runs forwards along the junction of the inner wall with the roof of the orbit. About the level of the front of the eyeball its tendon passes through the pulley, which, if it has been damaged on the left side, is intact on the right. It can usually be easily felt

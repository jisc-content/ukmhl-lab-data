151 THE PAROTID GLAND stylo-mastoid foramen, where its branches to the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-liyoid muscles should be looked for (see Fig. 74). 4. Cut the branches of the pes anserinus, turn it back, and look for the Temporo-maxillary Vein, which is usually, though not always, on a deeper plane (Fig. 73, T.M.V.). It is formed by the junction of the superficial temporal and internal maxillary veins behind the neck of the condyle and emerges from the gland at its lower part, where it usually divides into an anterior and posterior branch. Of these the anterior joins the facial veui to form the common facial, while the posterior joins the posterior auricular to form the external jugular vein. These veins, however, hke others, are liable to great variation. 5. On reflecting the veins the external carotid artery is seen on a deeper plane (Fig. 73, E.C.A.). It divides into its superficial temporal and internal maxillary branches at the level of the neck of the condyle; the former leaves the gland at its upper part, while the latter comes out at the base of the already-mentioned pterygoid lobe. 6. The auricula-temporal nerve, which lies in the posterior part of the glenoid cavity, may be one of the structures embedded in the parotid, because the gland some- times sends a process called the glenoid lobe up behind the condyle of the jaw. There is no doubt, however, that this lobe, even when it is present, is often non-glandular, and is â€¢merely composed of dense fibrous tissue. The auriculo-temporal nerve has already been found in the pterygoid region as well as on the scalp, so that this connecting part of its course will be easily explored. Notice once more that it passes deep to the superficial temporal artery. If the body has been injected with formalin, there is now little difficulty in removing the remains of the gland entire, and in noticing the groove on its deep surface made by the styloid process. The gland therefore moulds itself on to the

402 PRACTICAL ANATOMY musculo-cutaneous nerve [n. peronteus superficialis] wMchJ descends upon the outer surface of the fibula under cover om the peroneus longus to the interval between the two peronM muscles, and then becomes cutaneous immediately behinM the anterior peroneal septum at the junction of the middlS and lower thirds of the leg. In its course the musculo-] cutaneous nerve furnishes twigs to the two peronei muscles] between which it lies. | POSTEBIOR TlBIO-FIBULAR COMPARTMENT I The skin may now be entirely removed from the leg, buii should be preserved, as it furnishes a very useful covering in which to wrap the part in the intervals of dissection. In the upper half of the region search should be made in the super- ficial fascia for a number of small twigs of the small sciatic nerve, while in the lower half a relatively large nerve—the external saphenous—will be found descending in or near the median line. This nerve is formed by the union of two others, which usually pierce the deep fascia separately, the ramus communicans tibialis and the ramus communicans fihularis. Lying with these nerves, and forming in most cases a very prominent object, is the external saplienoxis vein, which passes upwards along a line from the back of the external malleolus to the middle of the popliteal space, where it has already been seen terminating in the pophteal vein. The internal saphenous vein also lies for a time in this region, passing upwards just behind the internal border of the tibia. In the superficial fascia, in close relation to the vein, is the internal saphenous nerve, while a little posterior in the upper part of the leg is the posterior division of the internal cutaneous nerve. The deep fascia should now be removed. Make a median vertical incision and turn it inwards and outwards. The two fleshy bellies of the gastrocnemius will now be fully exposed as they pass down to form the superficial part of a large tendon, the icndo

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 116 and in cleaning it care should be taken of the facial vein, which crosses it superficially. The Levator Labii Superioris et Aloa Nasi [caput angu- lare musculi quadrati labii superioris] rises from the nasal process of the maxilla, close to the inner angle of the eye, and runs down to the upper lip as well as, sometimes, to the ala of the nose (see Fig. 53). The compressor naris comes from the side of the bony aperture of the nose and spreads out as a fan-shaped muscle just above the ala. Along its lower margin the lateral nasal branch of the facial artery runs. To display these structures fully the levator labii superioris et alse nasi should be cut and reflected. Now find the entrance of the nasal nerve [N. nasociliaris], a branch of the first division of the fifth cranial nerve, on to the face about half-way along the lower border of the nasal bone, and follow it down to the tip of the nose. In dissecting the side of the nose two small dilatores naris muscles and a depressor aloe nasi may be seen, but they are of small importance. Next look for the rnalar branch of the temporo-malar nerve [N. zygomatico facialis] which comes from the second division of the fifth; its little foramen is in the malar bone about a quarter of an inch from the lower and outer angle of the orbital margin, and is covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum. The zygomaticus onajor [M. zygo- maticus] rises from the posterior part of the malar bone, and the muscle should be traced down to the angle of the mouth. Its course is very superficial. If a living face in the act of smiling is looked at, a curved crease will be noticed starting at the upper limit of the ala or distended part of the nose, and running downwards to a little distance outside the angle of the mouth. This is the naso-labial furrow, and is produced by the action of three facial muscles to which different parts of it are at right angles. ' Starting from the nose, it runs at first nearly horizontally

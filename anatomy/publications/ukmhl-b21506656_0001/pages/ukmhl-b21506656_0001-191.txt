THE NECK 171 the first and to the scalenus mediiis and levator anguli scapulee from the third and fourth. B. Spinal accessory communicating branches from the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves. These either join the spinal accessory directly or form a plexus, with branches of that nerve from which the sterno-mastoid and trapezius are supplied. Now that the sterno-mastoid and posterior belly of the digastric muscle have been reflected, the occipital artery may be followed a step further. It will be found running upwards and backwards to the interval between the tip of the mastoid process and the transverse process of the atlas, and it should be noticed that both these bony points may be touched with the opposite sides of the index finger-tip at the same time. Running up from the transverse process of the atlas to the jugular process of the occipital bone, which is internal to the mastoid process, is the rectus capitis lateralis muscle, and on the outer side of this the occipital artery crosses the muscle diagonally from its antero-inferior to its postero- superior angle (see Fig. 81). The artery is still deep to the digastric and, on reaching the base of the skull, lies in the groove on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone just internal to the digastric fossa, from which the posterior belly of the digastric rises. A dried skull should be at hand, and it will be noticed that when the artery reaches the suture between the mastoid portion of the temporal and the occipital bones it is close to the mastoid foramen, through which it sometimes sends a posterior meningeal artery, though, as the foramen is not always present, this branch is inconstant. As soon as the occipital bone is reached the- occipital artery lies superficial to the insertion of the superior oblique muscle, which is just beliind the rectus capitis lateralis ; here it lies deep to the insertions of the splenius capitis and trachelo-mastoid muscles, and is continuous with that part

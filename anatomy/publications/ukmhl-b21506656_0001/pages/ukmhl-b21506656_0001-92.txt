72 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The third division of the fifth is seen to leave the skull at the foramen ovale, the second should be traced forwards, embedded in the dura mater, to the foramen rotundum, while the first division passes forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus to the sphenoidal fissure through which it enters the orbit. Before reaching the foramen, however, it divides into three branches, lacrimcd, frontal, and nasal [N. nasociliaris], Fig. 35.â€”Diagram of the Nerves in the Odter Wall and Floor OP THE CaVERNODS SiNCS (LOOKED AT PROM THE OUTER SiDE). 5a.

In the dissection of this first division of the fifth nerve the cavernous blood sinus will probably be opened, but it is advisable to study its cavity on the opposite side rather than to run the risk of damaging the other cranial nerves which lie in its walls. The fourth nerve [N. trochlearis] needs great care in its exposure; it should be picked up with the forceps at the point where the attached border of the tentorium is crossed by the free, made fairly tight, and then a knife with a really sharp point run forwards along its course, the back of the

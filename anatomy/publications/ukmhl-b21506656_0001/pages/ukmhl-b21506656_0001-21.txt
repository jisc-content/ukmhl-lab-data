VOL. I. ^ PRACTICAL ANATOMY VOLUME I HEAD AND NECK The dissection of tlie bead and neck should be begun as soon as the body is brought into the room. First fill the mouth and nostrils with tow or cotton wool soaked in spirit and water with which some glycerine is mixed. As a rule, it is not necessary to sew up the mouth in bodies preserved with formalin. Then wrap up the front of the face in an oiled cloth or gutta-percha tissue, bandaging it securely on the outside. During the first seven days, while the body is on its face, the back of the scalp, together with the deeper parts of the back of the neck and trunk, and the spinal cord should be dissected. If, when this is finished, the other dissectors are not ready to have the body turned on to its back, the dissectors of the head and neck may go on with the dissection of the scalp (p. 46) or the pinna (p. 56). THE DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE SCALP Define the external occipital protuberance, and from it make a vertical incision upwards for about a hand's-breadth {i.e. three inches). From the top of this make another out- wards to just above the top of the pinna. While this is being done, the dissectors of the upper extremity are making an incision outwards from the external occipital protuberance

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 232 Dissect the mucous membrane away from tbe posterior surface of the larynx, and look for the arytenoideus mwcle [M. arytenoideus transversus], which runs transversely across from the concave posterior surface of one arytenoid to that of the other. On its surface there are some diagonal fibres which run from the lower and outer angle of each arytenoid, crossing one another like an X, to be continued upwards and outwards into the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of the Fig. 105.â€”Scheme of Laryngeal Muscles.

It is clear that the arytenoideus muscle must draw the two arytenoid cartilages towards one another (see Fig. 105). The crico-arytenoideus posticus muscle rises from its own side of the posterior expanded or signet part of the cricoid cartilage; its fibres, converging, run upwards and forwards to the back of the muscular process of the arytenoid, a stout process projecting outwards from the outer side of the base of that cartilage. This muscle, by pulling the muscular process back, rotates the arytenoid on its vertical axis, and

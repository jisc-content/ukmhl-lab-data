THE GLUTEAL REGION 355 When it is noticed how directly above the great trochanter the origin of the gluteus medius is, it will easily be appreciated that this muscle must act as a powerful abductor of the hip. It should be remembered, however, in thinking out the actions of any of the lower extremity muscles, that when the foot is on the ground the lower attachment acts as the origin. Doubtless, the usual action of this muscle is to lateralise the pelvis in walking, thus bringing the centre of gravity of the body directly over the hip-joint and allowing the other foot to be lifted off the ground. On turning the muscle downward the bursa above men- tioned, between it and the great trochanter, should be looked for. A considerable portion of the dorsum ilii is now exposed as well as the gluteus minimus, which hitherto has been completely hidden by the medius. The deep division of the gluteal artery and the superior gluteal nerve are now exposed, and should be carefully cleaned. In par- ticular the anterior fibres of the gluteus minimus should be closely scrutinised, for passing forward between them is a small branch of the superior gluteal nerve which enters the tensor fasciae femoris muscle on its deep surface. The deep division of the Gluteal artery divides into an upper and a lower branch, and ends in anastomoses along the anterior border of the ilium (Fig. 156). The Gluteus Minimus [m. glutceus minimus] arises from the dorsum ilii between the middle curved line above and the inferior curved Hne below. Its fibres converge to the tendon of insertion, which passes over the great trochanter, a bursa intervening, and gains attachment to the anterior surface of that process. It should be divided in a manner similar to that in which the gluteus medius was treated. On turning it down the aforementioned bursa should be looked for. By the reflexion of the muscle the capsiole of the hip-joint will be exposed This should be carefully cleaned, when it will be noticed that

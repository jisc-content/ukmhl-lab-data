369 THE THIGH reached, remembering that the outer pillar of this ring is attached to the spine of the pubis. The spine is almost exactly an inch from the mid line of the top of the sym- physis pubis. In front of the knee the patella can be felt with the liga- mentum patellse below it. On each side of the latter the outline of the knee-joint may be made out, especially if it be slightly moved ; notice that the lower edge of the patella corresponds to the line of the joint. The contours of the inner and outer sides of the thigh differ a good deal; on the outer side there is a slight con- vexity above corresponding to the gluteus medius, then a depression superficial to the great trochanter; below that a long, slight convexity formed by the vastus externus, but as the patella is approached, this fades away into a flattening or even a slight concavity. It is here that the ilio-tibial band may be felt. On the inner side, just above the patella, is a rather marked bulging caused by vastus internus and sartorius, while above the middle of the thigh the adductor mass makes its characteristic convexity. Below Poupart's ligament, and more to the inner than the outer side of the median line of the limb, a somewhat triangular depression can be felt, of which Poupart's ligament forms the base. This depression, which occupies the upper third of the front of the thigh, corresponds to a well-marked space in the dissected limb known as Scarpa's triangle. Dissection.â€”Make an incision along the whole length of Poupart's ligament if this has not already been made by the dissector of the abdomen. From the extremities of this line make two vertical incisions to the level of the knee and reflect downwards the large flap so circumscribed. The Superficial Fascia now exposed should be carefully examined for subcutaneous vessels and nerves. It will be convenient to begin with the veins, readily recognisable by their colour. The largest vein is the Internal or Lona VOL. I. 2 A ^

THE BRAIN 293 a circular reddish patch on each side dorsal to the substantia nigra. This is the red nucleus, and it is quite possible that fibres of the third or ,oculo-motor nerve may be traced through it from their nucleus in the floor of the Sylvian aqueduct to the groove on the inner side of each crus. When the temporal lobe is drawn aside, notice how the crus of that side gradually sinks into the substance of the cerebrum. Notice, too, how the optic tract, running back- wards from the optic commissure, crosses superficial to (below) the crus. In this way the two crura, the two optic tracts, and the optic commissure enclose a pentagonal area known as the INTEKPEDUNCULAR SPACE, the contents of Avhich from before back are the tuber cinereum with its infundibulum, the corpora albicantia, and the posterior perforated space. On the inner side of each crus, between the crusta and the tegmentum, is the oculo-motor groove [sulcus n. oculo- motorii], from which the t]iird cranial or oculo-motor nerve takes its superficial origin (see Fig. 130). Winding round the outer side of the crus is the delicate trochlear â–  ox fourth cranial nerve, but this is likely to be below the point of section, since it rises from the roof of the fourth ventricle. If these nerves are not seen in the first brain they should be looked for very carefully in the second later on. Behind the crura cerebri is the pons Varolii, a large com- missure between the two halves of the cerebellum. The transverse direction of its superficial fibres is quite evident, and in the median line is a slight furrow for the basilar artery. The large trigeminal or fifth cranial nerves emerge from it about an inch from the mid line, and the small motor root should be distinguished from the large sensory, lying close to the inner side of the latter. On each side the pons disappears into the substance of the cerebellum. At its posterior border, quite close to the mid line, the

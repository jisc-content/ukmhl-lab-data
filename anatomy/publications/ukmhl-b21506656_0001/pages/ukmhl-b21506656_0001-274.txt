PRACTICAL ANATOMY 254 incisions used to be made when it was necessary to drain the middle ear, though now aural surgeons take the incisions higher. Although it cannot be demonstrated in the dissecting- room, it is important to remember that the membrane consists of three layers—the outer skin, the middle fibrous tissue, and the inner, the mucous membrane lining the tympanum. The Middle Ear The Tympanum, Mastoid Antrum, and Mastoid Cells. —The section which has been made on the right side passes across the tympanum or middle ear, and it will be at once appreciated, on looking at it, what a narrow, slit-like cavity this is (Fig. 113). From the tympanic membrane to the inner wall is only about one-sixth of an inch at its narrowest, and the cavity is much narrower below than above, although the narrowest point is between the promontory (see later) and the umbo about two-thirds of the way down (Fig. 115). The height, however, is more than half an inch, and it will be noticed that the membrane only occupies about the lower two-thirds of the outer wall. That part of the cavity which Hes above the level of the top of the membrane is known as the attic, and its roof is a thin plate of compact bone called the tegmen tympani, which separates it from the middle cranial fossa. _ _ It is important to realise that the roof of the attic is continuous with that of the antrum. A fine seeker passed forwards will traverse the bony part of the Eustachian tube which opens from the front of the tympanum, while if the seeker is pushed backwards from the attic it goes through another opening, known as the aditus. into the mastoid antrum (see Fig. 113). The floor of the tympanum is divided by an extremely thin plate of bone from the jugular fossa (contaimng the

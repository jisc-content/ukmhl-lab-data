99 THE NECK The Internal Relations of the Common Carotid Artery are:— Bones.—None. Muscles.—Inferior Constrictor, (Esophagus. Fibrous Structures.—Cellular tissue forming inner part of carotid sheath. Arteries.—Inferior Thyroid. Veins.—None of special interest. Nerves.—Recurrent Laryngeal. Other Structures.—Larynx and Trachea, The Inferior constrictor [M, constrictor pharyngis in- ferioris] may just be seen as it passes back from the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, but its detailed exammation should be left till later. The (Esophagus should be identified lying behind and shghtly to the left of the trachea. Notice its appearance in a section through the 7th Cervical or 1st Thoracic vertebra, and also that the easiest way to reach it in the living body would be behind the left sterno-mastoid and carotid artery (see Fig. 48). The Inferior Thyroid artery [A. thyreoidea- inferior] has been dissected already in connection with the thyroid gland. The recurrent laryngeal nerve should be looked for in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus. On the side on which half the thyroid gland has been removed its upper end has probably already come into view. The Larynx is best left for future investigation, but as much of the Trachea as is exposed should be carefully mvestigated. If the neck of a living person be felt while the face is looking forward, it will be found that there is only about an inch from the cricoid cartilage to the supra- sternal notch; that is to say, the cervical trachea is only about an mch in length, but when the head is tilted back as far as it will go the length of the cervical trachea is nearly doubled.

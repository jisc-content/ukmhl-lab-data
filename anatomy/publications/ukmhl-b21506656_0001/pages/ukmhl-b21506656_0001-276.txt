256 PRACTICAL ANATOMY jugular fossa internal to the root of the styloid process, and so to the stylo-mastoid foramen. Behind that it will pass through the digastric fossa of the mastoid process. It will be more satisfactory if these points are first locahsed on a dry temporal bone of the same side, and then the line determined in the moist specimen. Still holding the bone upside down, cut along this line with a fret-saw, making the cut as vertical as possible. If a vice is obtainable, it makes things much easier to fix the squamous part of the temporal in that; but if this is not available, the other dissector must help to steady the bone. When this section is made, the antero-posterior extent of the tympanum is seen to be about the same as its height, that is, rather more than half an inch (see Fig. 116). The tympanum may now be pictured as a somewhat cir- cular vertical slit lying in the petrous bone between the outer and inner ears, the diameter being about half an inch, while the breadth is only one-sixth of an inch below. For convenience of description a narrow roof and floor may be recognised, a narrow anterior and posterior wall, and an extensive external and internal wall. Of these the roof and floor have been studied. The outer wall is seen in the section just made; the tympanic membrane occupies the greater part of it, but above and behind is the attic, the outer wall of Avhich is the bone at the root of the zygoma. In this attic the head of the malleus and the greater part of the mcus are lymg; at least these two bones usually come away with the outer half of the section, while the stapes remains attached to the inner wall (Fig. 116). , , Between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus the clwrda tympani nerve is seen running for- ward to a small opening in front of the upper part of the tympanic ring; this is the iter chordcB antenus, ^nd it hes just on the outer side of the tympanic opening of the Eus- tachian tube.

894 PRACTICAL ANATOMY the internal cutaneoits nerve will be seen. The tributaries of the vein and the branches of the nerves should be followed as far as possible. The veins are particularly important'in this region on account of their tendency to become varicose. It is a good exercise to slit open the whole length of the long saphenous vein and to examine its interior for valves. These are numerous, but not nearly so numerous as is often stated. The superficial fascia may next be cleared away from the internal surface of the tibia, preserving, however, the nerves and vein. The three tendons inserted into this surface will now be exposed. They should be carefully cleaned and traced to their insertions. In doing this it will be seen that the tendons are more or less united, and at the same time they are separated from each other and from the underlying internal lateral ligament by a well-marked bursa. The sartorius is inserted most anteriorly, the gracilis and semi- tendinosus behind, the former above the latter. On turning the tendons forward a good view will be obtained of the internal lateral ligament of the knee, its superficial surface smooth and glistening from the overlying bursa. At the posterior border of the ligament, partly continuous with it, partly passing deep to it, is the rounded tendon of insertion of the semi-membranosus muscle. The Antebioe Tibio-fibular Compartment To expose this compartment, the skin must be reflected outwards from the anterior border of the tibia. In the super- ficial fascia two nerves should be found, a cutaneous branch to the upper part from the external popliteal nerve, and the cutaneous division of the viusculo-cutaneoxis nei^e [n. peronJEUs superficialis] to the lower part. The former branch should be found by incising the fascia along a Ime forwards and downwards from the neck of the fibula, the latter nerve at the junction of the middle and lower thu-ds

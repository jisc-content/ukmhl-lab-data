THE SCALP ^ mastoid branch (ramus meningeus) is often found passmg through to the dura mater. The occipital lymph nodes [lymphogiandulte occipitales] are important, since they are so often the site of abscesses, especially in neglected children. The third occipital nerve [N. occipitalis tertius] should be looked for between the point at which the great occipital was O.L.N Fig. 2.â€”Dissection of Occipital Rkgion. O.A. Occipital Artery.

It is the internal (medial) branch of the posterior primary division of the third cervical nerve. Occasionally the suboccipital nerve [N. suboccipitalis] supplies an area on the scalp just external to that supplied by the great occipital. It is the posterior primary division of the first cervical nerve. The posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle [M occipitalis] should be looked for rising just above the outer

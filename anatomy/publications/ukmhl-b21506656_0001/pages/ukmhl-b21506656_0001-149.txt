THE PTERYGOID REGION 129 dissection mucli more easy. Another posterior cut should be made as far back as can be done without injuring the capsule of the jaw joint and the included piece of the zygoma turned down (Fig. 61, Cut B). In doing this the masseteric nerve and artery, coming through the sigmoid notch, must be looked for, and, when cleaned, divided. The deep part of the masseter may now be shaved off its attachment to the mandible, and the extent of its attachment noted. When these structures are removed, the whole surface of the ramus Fig. 61.â€”Diagram of the Bone Incisions necessary to expose , THE Pterygoid Region. The Letters are referred to in THE Text. iof the jaw, with its coronoid process and the insertion of tthe temporal muscle, is exposed, and the next step is to (divide the coronoid process from the rest of the mandible I by an oblique cut reaching from the sigmoid notch to the 1 lower part of the anterior border of the ramus, in order to i include as much as possible of the insertion of the temporal t muscle (Fig. 61, Cut C). Now the temporal muscle and coro- .noid process may be turned up, and it will be seen that, .in addition to the strong tendinous insertion into the tip and i anterior border of the process, there is a more fleshy one on its deep surface. In turning up the muscle the deep tem- i^poral arteries and nerves must be looked for runnino- up to VOL. I. f ^

THE SPINAL CORD 21 from the foramen magmim to the second or third sacral vertebra. At its lower pointed end the dura mater blends with the fikim terminale of the cord,which is continued down for about 2 inches to the posterior surface of the coccyx, thus anchoring the apex of the dural sac (see Fig. 11). Fig. 9.â€”Dissection op the Spinal Cord in the Upper Thoeacic Region from behind. Fed. Pedicle. L.Dent. Ligamentum Denticulatum. A.B. Anterior Nerve Root. P.R.O. Posterior Root Ganglion. Where the spinal nerves leave the dura mater they have separate sleeves for the anterior and posterior roots. Open up one or two of the intervertebral foramina by cutting away the articular processes with a chisel or forceps (parrot-bill forceps are very useful here if available); this will expose the ganglia on the posterior nerve roots which lie in the foramina. Each of these nerve roots is surrounded by a sleeve of the dura mater which becomes the sheath of

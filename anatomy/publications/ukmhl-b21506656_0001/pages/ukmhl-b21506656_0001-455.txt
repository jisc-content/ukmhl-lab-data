Ligamentum PatelL-e. Inf.Pat.B. Infra-patellar Bursa. Fib.T. Fibrous Tissue between the Posterior Crucial and Posterior Liga- ments. P.Lig. Posterior Ligament. A.Cr.L. Anterior Crucial Liga- ment. P.Cr.L. Posterior Crucial Ligament. When this has been done the two condyles may be turned aside from one another and the crucial ligaments studied.

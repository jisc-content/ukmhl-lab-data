INTRACRANIAL REGION 81 mater away from the petrous bone, where it forms the floor of Meckel's cave. The object of this is to find the great superficial petrosal nerve, which comes out of the hiatus Fallopii in the petrous bone below the Gasserian ganglion to pierce the cartilage forming the middle lacerated foramen. It is, of course, outside Meckel's cave. Just in front and below is the much smaller small super- ficial petrosal nerve, which needs very careful looking for, and generally disappears through the petro-sphenoid suture. When the base of the skull has been carefully revised, chisel away the dorsum sellre, and then remove the pituitary body, placing it carefully in the pot with the rest of the brain. r DISSECTION OF THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE OF THE NECK This triangle has for its base the lower border of the body of the mandible and a line continued back from that until the sterno-mastoid is reached; its anterior boundary is the mid Hue of the neck, its posterior the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, while its apex points down- wards in the suprasternal notch. Surface Anatomy.—Before beginning the actual dis- section let the head fall well back and make out the following points: About two inches behind and below the chin in the mid line is the hody of the hyoid hone; in a living person, standing up, this is almost level with the chin, horizontally, and corresponds to the third cervical vertebra behind. In a thin subject the great cornua can be felt by gripping the bone between the finger and thumb, and it is sometimes even possible to feel the lesser cornu with the index finger. It is a great advantage to explore landmarks in the living as well as in the dead subject, and to remember that the index finger of the right hand is the one which has had most education and experience. The pressure should be VOL. I. „

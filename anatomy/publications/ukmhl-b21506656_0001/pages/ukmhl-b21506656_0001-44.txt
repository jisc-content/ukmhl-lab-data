24 PRACTICAL ANATOMY or four cervical nerves, the spinal part of the spinal accessory [ramus internus nervi accessorii] will be seen running up to the foramen magnum and receiving twigs from the lateral part of the cord. As the nerve ascends it will be seen to lie between the posterior nerve roots and the ligamentum denti- culatum (see Fig. 10). Now trace the vertebral artery from where it was left in the dissection of the suboccipital region. The posterior arch of the atlas and posterior occipito-atlantal ligament have been removed, so that the artery may be followed easily to the outer surface of the dura mater through which it dis- appears after giving off a posterior meningeal branch [ramus menmgeus], which, like all the other meningeal arteries, is extradural. On turning to the inner side of the opened dura mater the artery is not seen coming through until the ligamentum denticulatum is cut away. Then it is seen to have pierced the dura mater obliquely, and to have reflected a good deal of the deep fibrous layers of the latter on to its own coats. As soon as the vertebral artery has pierced the dura mater, it gives off the posterior spinal branch [A. spinahs posterior], which runs downwards, often being in front of one or two spinal posterior roots, but later on passmg between two of them to gain its permanent position behind the posterior roots. Now take a general survey of the sp>inal cord-from behind, and notice that it begins at the foramen magnum and ends opposite the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra. In an adult male it measures about eighteen inches. In the cervical and lower thoracic regions it thickens to form the cervical and lumbar enlargements [intumescentia cervicahs et lumbalis], where the nerves for the great hmb plexuses come off. Below it tapers to an apex forming the conus nudullans, from which the intradural part of the filum terminate runs

PRACTICAL ANATOMY 314 The Membranes of the Brain Now that the whole surface of the brain has been studied, it will be easy to understand the relations of the membranes and vessels. For this purpose the second brain should be used, the arteries of which have, if possible, been injected, though this is not absolutely necessary. The first brain, which has hitherto been worked with, should be kept at hand for reference. The Arachnoid Membrane [arachnoidea encephaU] is continuous with that covering the cord, but invests the brain more closely. The subdural space, which lies outside it, has already been noticed with the dura mater (p. 61). At the base of the brain are several large spaces separat- ing the arachnoid from the pia mater and known as cisternte. One of the most important of these, the cisterna hasalis [c. interpeduncularis], occupies the interpeduncular space. Notice how the optic nerves emerge from the front of this, and have a distinct sheath of the arachnoid surrounding them. Just behind these the internal carotid arteries enter the space, while, farther back and a little more laterally, the third nerves are seen, but the arachnoid sheaths of these and of the other cranial nerves, unlike those of the optic, very soon blend with the coat of the nerves. Open the cisterna, and notice the thread-like trabeculte which stretch across it, and are so characteristic of the sub- arachnoid space in which the cerebro-spinal fluid is contained. Antero-laterally the space projects like two horns into the valleculte Sylvii, forming the cisterncv Sylvii [c. fossjB lateralis cerebri]. Posteriorly the cisterna basalis is continued into the cis- terna po7itis, lying beneath and in front of the pons and medulla, and so becomes continuous with the spinal sub- arachnoid space. Try to identify the various cranial nerves from the fourth to the twelfth emerging from it.

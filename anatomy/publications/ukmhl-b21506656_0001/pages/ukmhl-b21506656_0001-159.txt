THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION 139 ! the space that it is hardly ever cut away, though a com- municating branch which is sometimes found between the lingual and inferior dental nerves is often mistaken for it. The nerve to the internal pterygoid may be looked for now as well as the otic ganglion, but they are both more easily seen and reached from the mid line later on when the skull has been bisected. From this, its outer aspect, the nerve to the internal pterygoid may be displayed by dis- secting just in front of and deep to the upper part of the lingual nerve. The only difl&culty about the dissection is its depth (see Fig. 66). On looking carefully at a skull it will be easily appre- ciated that the Eustachian tube and levator palati muscle lie deep to the third division of the fifth nerve and its branches, as it passes down from the foramen ovale. DEEP DISSECTION OF THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION Having reviewed the superficial dissection of the sub- maxillary triangle, saw through the mandible just external to the attachment of the digastric muscle, and after dividing the facial artery and vein, turn the piece of bone up. Next cut through the anterior belly of the digastric close to its tendon, and turn it forwards very gently so as to see its nerve from the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental. The whole course of this mylo-hyoid nerve can now be traced up to the inferior dental foramen, where it comes off. This allows the suhmaxillary gland to be studied, and it will be noticed on turning it up that it is astride of the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle; its superficial lobe passing forwards on the exposed surface of the mylo- ' hyoid, while its deep lobe is concealed by the muscle. Sometimes, as in Fig. 67, the deep lobe of the submaxillary gland is prolonged forwards below the duct for a great distance.

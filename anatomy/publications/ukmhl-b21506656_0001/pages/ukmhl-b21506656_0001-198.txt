PRACTICAL ANATOMY 17S do this satisfactorily the skull should be divided, but in such a way that the subsequent dissection of the ear is not inter- fered Avith. By the time the dissection has reached this stage the dissectors of the thorax will probably have got on so far that it will not inconvenience them if the head and neck are removed between the first and second thoracic vertebra;, thus retaining the first rib and its attachments. It is not often that they can fairly be asked to allow more than this to go, but, if for any reason it is possible to do so, it is better to divide the spinal column below the third thoracic vertebra, thus preserving the whole of the longils colli muscle. Cut through the trachea and oesophagus and pull them forward away from the vertebrte; the knife need hardly be used in doing this, because the cellular tissue behind the oesophagus and pharynx and in front -of the prevertebral muscles is very loose and woolly, and forms a lymph space quite comparable to the subaponeurotic one already noticed on the scalp (see p. 54). On account of its laxity it will obviously form a path of least resistance for blood or pus, while, owing to the movement of the pharynx and oesophagus, these fluids will be distributed along its course. Turn the head upside down and separate the pharynx from the vertebral column as far as the base of the skull. On comparing the dissection with a dried skull it will be seen that posteriorly the pharynx is attached to the pharyngeal tubercle of the basioccipital bone, and it is between this and the insertion of the rectus capitis anticus major that the occipital bone must be chiselled through (see Fig. 88). Take a broad chisel and place its edge transversely against the skull just behind the attachment of the pharynx. A sharp blow with the mallet, the head being upside down on the table, is very likely to lead to a fracture of the base of the skull through the two carotid canals and glenoid

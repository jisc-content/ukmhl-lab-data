PRACTICAL ANATOMY 274 passing parallel to tlie upper border of the petrous bone through the vestibule, and a piece of wire pushed through the inner side of the cut canal will appear in the vestibule on its posterior surface. The Internal Auditory Meatus and Aqueduct of Fallopius [canalis faciahs] may be examined in the same piece of bone in which the inner part of the external semi- circular canal has been investigated, but a dry left temporal bone must be at hand for comparison. With a fret-saw and chisel remove the roof of the meatus and identify the facial nerve, which is the highest structure passing through it. This may be followed into the aqueduct of Fallopius, and if the other side of the same section is looked at, the aqueduct will be seen lying just above and behind the cochlea. Place this section in a vice and chisel away the roof of the aqueduct very carefully until the sudden bend and slight swelling of the facial nerve, known as the geniculate ganglion [g. genicuh], comes into view. After this the nerve and its aqueduct pass backwards and downwards, until they are seen again in the inner wall of the tympanum. When once the geniculate ganghon is opened up it is easy to expose the great superficial petrosal nerve which runs forwards and inwards from it to the hiatus Fallopii [hiatus canahs faciahs] on the anterior surface of the petrous bone. Below the facial nerve and coming oÂ£E from it near the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, the pars intermedia should be looked for. Below this is the vestibular branch of the auditory nerve, which when it reaches the lamina crihrosa, as the perforated plate it the bottom of the internal auditory meatus is called, goes through the area cribrosa superior, above the crista falciformis, to reach, as has just been noticed,_the utricle and the ampullae of the superior and external semicircular canals Most of the openings at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus have been noticed already, but, as tlie

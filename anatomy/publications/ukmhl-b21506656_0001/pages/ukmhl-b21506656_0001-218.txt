198 PRACTICAL ANATOMY suprema-] is generally present, and joins the superior tur- binated in front, so that the two enclose between them a small triangular highest meatus. Into the posterior part of this is the opening of the sphenoidal sinus which has been opened by the saw-cut, and should be carefully explored. Dissect away the mucous membrane from the outer wall of the nose, in doing which the turbinated bones will pro- bably come'away. Look out carefully for the anterior and external branches of the nasal nerve in the fore part, the former lying in the groove on the back of the nasal bone to reach at length the skin of the nose between the lower border of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage of the nose. At the hind end of the middle turbmated bone the spheno-palatine foramen will be exposed when the mucous membrane is stripped off, and through it the naso-palatme nerve and artery pass into the nose, and then run across the roof between the bone and mucous membrane to gam the septum. , r One or two small nasal twigs from Meckel s ganghon, with accompanying vessels, may be found if very carefully looked for; they pass through the spheno-palatme foramen, and supply the mucous membrane of the lateral wall, in addition to these, small nasal twigs come from the descending palatine and posterior superior dental nerves, and supply the lower part of the outer wall of the fossa. ^. . , In clearing the mucous membrane away from the front T3art of the lateral wall of the nose, it will be noticed that when the inner surface of the ala is reached there is a space iust inside the anterior nares, which is known as the vesti- bule, and is lined by skin bearing a few stiff hairs instead of by mucous membrane. This is the case for the septal as well as for the lateral wall. The roof of the nose is very narrow, and has a middle horizontal part as well as anterior and posterior sloping parts.

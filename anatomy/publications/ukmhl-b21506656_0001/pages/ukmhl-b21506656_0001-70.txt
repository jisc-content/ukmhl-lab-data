PRACTICAL ANATOMY 50 The anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle, which has been seen in displaying the foregoing nerves, is supplied by the temjooral branch of the facial or seventh cranial nerve [Ramus temporalis nervi facialis]. This should now be looked for running obliquely upwards and forwards, crossing the zygoma near its posterior end. By carefully dissecting along the posterior half of the zygoma the nerve will certainly be found, and a small twig of it should be looked for supplying the anterior and superior auricular muscles. It is very important to realise, once for all, that the branches of the facial nerve are entirely motor, and not to confuse them with sensory nerves. The auriculo-temporal nerve [N. auriculo-temporalis] represents the third division of the fifth on the scalp. It should be sought where it crosses the backward pro- longation of the zygoma, just in front of the ear and usually behind or deep to the superficial temporal artery. Its fibres may be traced to the skin of the side of the head as far back as the line of the ear as well as to the upper half of the outer surface of the pinna. (Only follow the nerves on to the pinna on one side.) Close behind the ear a sensory and a motor nerve must be found; the former is the great auricular nerve [N. auricularis magnus] from the cervical plexus. Twigs of this supply the skin over the mastoid process, the gi-eater part of that surface of the pinna which lies against the head and the lower part of the outer surface of the pinna. The trunk of this nerve has been found already in the dissection of the posterior triangle (see p. 36). The motor nerve behind the ear is the j)osterior auri- cular branch of the facial [N. auricularis posterior], supply- ing the posterior auricular muscle, the posterior intrinsic muscles of the ear and the posterior belly of the occipito- frontalis. To find it hook the ear forwards and clean the iwderior auricular muscle, which runs from the base of the

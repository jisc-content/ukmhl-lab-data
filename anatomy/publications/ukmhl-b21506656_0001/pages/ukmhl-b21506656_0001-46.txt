26 PKACTICAL ANATOMY down to the apex of the dural sheath, ah-eady localised at the level of the second or third sacral vertebra. The conus itself is opposite the twelfth thoracic spine. The filum terminale is hidden by the great mass of nerve roots which are run- ning down from the lumbar enlargement to the openings in the dural sheath opposite their respective intervertebral foramina. It is important to notice that, no matter how long a posterior root may be, its ganglion always lies m the intervertebral foramen. This mass, from its likeness to a horse's tail, is known as the cauda equina, and the filum terminale may be distinguished from any of the surrounding nerves by its ghstening appearance and median position. ^ The intradural part of the filum measures about eight mches, and, as the extradural has already been found to measure two, the total length of the structure is ten mches. Now remove the spinal cord by cutting through all the nerve roots and dividing it at the level of the foramen magnum; the filum terminale will be divided among the nerves of the cauda equina. Directions for the subsequent examination of the spmal cord are given now, though it may be found convenient to put the cord away in the brain jar for the present and to go on to the spinal canal (see p. 31). Examination of the Spinal Coed Looked at from in front, the linea splendens, within the substance of Avhich the single anterior spinal m^tery [K. spinalis anterior] is embedded, is seen in the mid Ime. This is a glistening thickening of the pia mater m front of the anterior median fissure of the cord. In the upper part the formation of the artery by the union of two branches, one from each vertebral, may be made out. ^ â€¢ ,.\ -a Cut through the linea splendens exactly in the mid ventral Ime and gently insert a seeker. This will open up

PKACTICAL ANATOMY 438' considerable clinical importance; one is that the internal lateral ligament is attached to the marginal surface, and the other that the coronary ligament is not so lax as that on the outer side, and so is more likely to be torn in a sudden wrench of the knee, while the attached internal lateral ligament tends to drag the cartilage out of its place. For these reasons, although it is normally the less movable of the two, displacement of the internal semilunar cartilage is a fairly common accident, especially among football players. The two semilunar cartilages will be seen to be con- nected anteriorly by a narrow transverse band sunk in the substance of the ligamentum mucosum, and known as the transverse ligament. A last glance at the two semilunar cartilages or menisci will satisfy the dissector as to their value: (1) for deadening shocks; (2) for adapting their shape to the changing curva- ture of the condyles during flexion and extension; and (3) for allowing the hinge movement of the knee to take place between them and the condyles, while the rotatory move- ment occurs between their flat lower surfaces and the head of the tibia. Finally revise and carefully note the various structures lying along the middle of the head of the tibia from behind forward. Most posteriorly of all is the posterior ligament, then the posterior crucial ligament, then the internal semi- lunar cartilage, and in front of that the two cornua of the external cartilage embracing the spine; more anteriorly is the anterior crucial ligament, then the internal semilunar cartilage, and, lastly, the transverse ligament and ligamen- tum mucosum.

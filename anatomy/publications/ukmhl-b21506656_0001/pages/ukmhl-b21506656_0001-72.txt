52 PRACTICAL ANATOMY There are first, second, and third divisions of the fifth, then anterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves; and finally first, second, and third posterior primary branches of the cervical nerves (see Fig. 23). The arteries of the scalp have three characteristics: (1) they are very tortuous; (2) they anastomose freely across the mid line; (3) they are closely attached to the dense fibres of the subcutaneous connective tissue in which they lie. For this reason, when wounded during life, they cannot contract properly, and so bleed very freely. Starting from the mid line anteriorly, the frontal artery [A. frontalis] is found close to the supratrochlear nerve ; then comes the supraorbital artery [A. supraorbitalis] accompany- ing its nerve, while, at the outer margin of the orbit, a few twigs from the lacrimal artery [A. lacrimalis] may be found. All these are branches of the ophthalmic artery and so of the internal carotid system. The superficial temporal artery [A. temporalis super- ficialis] is one of the terminal branches of the external carotid, and its trunk is seen just in front of the pinna. It divides into anterior and posterior branches, of which the former [ramus frontalis] runs forwards and upwards, and is the tortuous artery so often seen through the skin in the temples of old people. The posterior branch [ramus parietalis] runs nearly vertically upwards. The Posterior Auricular Artery [A. auricularis posterior] is another branch of the external carotid; it divides into auricular and mastoid branches. The Occipital Artery [A. occipitaHs] reaches the scalp close to the great occipital nerve, and divides into branches for the occipital region. Its size varies inversely with that of the posterior auricular artery. The veins of the scalp will be seen while the arteries are being dissected. They do not form a pair of vena; comites accompanying each artery, as would be the case with arteries

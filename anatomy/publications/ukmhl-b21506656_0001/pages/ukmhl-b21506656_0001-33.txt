The Posterior Primary Divisions of the Cervical Nerves divide into external and internal branches just as the thoracic do, but the internal are of more importance, because from the second to the fifth they become cutaneous, while the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical posterior primary divisions have no cutaneous supply at all. Some of the cutaneous branches may possibly have been damaged by the dissector of the upper extremity in reflecting the trapezius, but the great occipital, which is the cutaneous portion of the internal branch of the second, will be easily found piercing the complexus and running upwards and outwards to join the occipital artery. A little distance below and internal to this the cutaneous branch of the third cervical nerve pierces the complexus and often communi- cates with the second. When the complexus is cut the nerve may be traced between it and the semispinalis colU. The fourth and fifth internal branches have the same

The best way to see them is to get the thyroid larynx and trachea of a young child from the post-mortem room put it at once into formalin, and next day dissect the region where the inferior thyroid arteries enter the eland. Just above and just below these arteries the little glands are found, and may often be distinguished by a slight difference in their colour from that of the thyroid.

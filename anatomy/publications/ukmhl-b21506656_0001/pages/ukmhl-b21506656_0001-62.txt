PRACTICAL ANATOMY 42 The Posteeior Relations of the Third Part op THE Subclavian Artery Bones.—First Rib. Misc^es.—Scalenus Medius and first serration of the Serratus Magnus. Fibrous Structures.—Cellular tissue. Arteries and Veins.—None. Nerves.—The Eighth Cervical and First Thoracic Nerves joining to form the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. Glandular and other Structures.—None. It is very important to realise how much the first rib slopes downwards; the slope of its so-called upper surface is the same as that of the so-called anterior surface of the manubrium sterni. The lower trunk of the plexus lies right down on the rib, and is often mistaken for, and tied instead of, the artery m operations on the dead body. To avoid making this mistake later on, the dissector should find the outer edge of the scalenus anticus, a muscle which is not really in the pos- terior triangle, since its edge is just behind that of the sterno- mastoid. Follow this edge down with the finger until the first rib is reached, when the artery is the structure im- mediately behind the finger. The first serration of the serratus magnus is a muscle which is often unexpected in this region. It is easily distinguished by the horizontal direction of its fibres, which°form the floor of the supraclavicular triangle. A separate twig of the posterior thoracic nerve is generally seen entering it. The Superior Relations of the Third Part of the Subclavian Artery are not very numerous; still it is well to go through the usual routine. Bones.—^ one. ifuscies.—Omo-hyoid. Fibrous Structures.—CeWnlav tissue.

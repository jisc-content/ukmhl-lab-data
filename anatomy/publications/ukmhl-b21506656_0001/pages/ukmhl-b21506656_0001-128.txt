PRACTICAL ANATOMY 108 and lower margin of the- jaw, though in old and edentulous people it is, of course, higher. The relation of the more important soft parts to the surface will be noticed as they are dealt with. Dissection Make a large skin flap of the whole of the side of the face, as one large flap makes such a much better covering thaii several small ones and does not shrink so much. To do this make an incision through the skin from just in front of the ear down to the angle of the jaw, and, if it has not been done already, forwards along the lower border of the jaw to the mid line of the chin. Now the whole of the skin of the face can be dissected forwards, with the tri- angular flap already turned down from the scalp as far as the mid line of the face. In doing this it will be noticed how thin the skin is in the eyelids and how thick round the mouth and side of the nose. While the skin is being removed from the eyelids, the superficial anatomy of these structures should be noticed, not only in the dead but in a living person's eye. With every movement of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle the skin is thrown into minute wrmkles, since it is very closely bound to the muscle. Where the two eyelids meet internally is the inner cantlms [commissura palpe- brarum' medialis], and here is a little bay, known as the lacus lacrimalis, containing a small pink cushion, the caruncula lacrimalis, formed of modified skin. Just external to this is a small crescentic fold ot the coniunctiva, a membrane described later, which is known as the Plica Semilunaris [P. lacrimalis], and is the vestige ot the third eyelid of birds and some mammals. _ On everting the margins of the eyelids a minute pinhole aperture, situated on a little papilla, will be seen in each lid iust at the point at which the bay-like lacus lacrima is joins the rest of the lid. These are the Puncta Lacriviaha, and

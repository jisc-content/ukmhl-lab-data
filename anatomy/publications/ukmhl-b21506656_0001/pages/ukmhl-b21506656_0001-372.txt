352 PRACTICAL ANATOMY Magnus muscle, easily distinguished from the straight lower margin of the quadratus femoris by its crescentic upper border. The adductor magnus is not an easy muscle to understand, and it should be studied therefore from all points of view. Note that the fibres forming the upper border are coming from the pubis, while those arising from the ischial tuberosity are passing almost vertically downward. Rising from the posterior surface of the tuber ischii are the three hamstrings. Of these the biceps and semiten- dinosus are superficial and the semimembranosus deep. Notice that the biceps is tendinous and external at its origin, while the semitendinosus, in spite of its name, is fleshy and internal. The semimembranosus rises by a flat tendon which lies deep to the other two and appears slightly on their outer side. Having cleaned the various muscles the dissector should next trace the vessels and nerves already identified in both proximal and distal directions. The dissection may be ren- dered more easy by removing the vente comites, the course of which in the buttock is identical with that of the arteries. Special care should be given to the structures—viz. the nerve to the obturator internus, the internal pudic vessels and pudic nerve—lying on the ischial spine and small sacro- sciatic ligament. The branch from the first named to the superior gemellus should be looked for. At the upper border of the quadratus femoris the small ascending branch of the internal circumflex artery is often to be observed, while deep in the interval between this muscle and the inferior gemellus lies the tendon of the obturator externus muscle. _ . At the lower border of the quadratus lemons another branch, the tra^isverse, of the internal circumflex artery should be looked for; it anastomoses with the transverse branch of the external circumflex, the two vessels formmg a more or less complete arterial ring round the shait ol

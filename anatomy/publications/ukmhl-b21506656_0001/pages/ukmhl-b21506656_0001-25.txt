THE SPINAL REGION 5 preferably the second and eighth thoracic. Be careful not to cut these. . , , The Serratus Posticus Sheet joins the spines ot tne vertebra to the ribs. As a rule, only the upper and lower parts of this sheet persist in man. The Serratus Posticus Sitperior is the upper part, and rises from the spines of the last cervical and upper two or three thoracic vertebrce as well as from the supraspinous ligaments joining these spines. The muscle runs outwards and downwards to the ribs, from the second to the fifth inclusive, a little outside the angles. The Serratus Posticus Inferior is the lower part, and rises from the lumbar fascia over the loins rather than directly from the vertebral spines. The muscle runs up- wards and outwards, and is inserted into the lower four ribs just outside the margin of the erector spinse. Reflect both these muscles and try to find a delicate nerve plexus derived from the intercostals by which they are supplied. The Splenius Sheet rises from the lower part of the hgamentum nuchse as high as the level of the third cervical vertebra, the upper four or five thoracic spines and the supraspinous ligament joining their tips. It is inserted into the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone and the outer surface of the mastoid process deep to the sterno-mastoid. As this insertion is hidden by that of the sterno-mastoid, it is necessary, in order to see it, to cut through the tendinous insertion of the latter muscle along the superior curved line for about two-thirds of its breadth. Be very careful, however, not to cut through those anterior fibres of the sterno-mastoid which are attached to the mastoid process. This part, which is inserted into the head, is called the splenius capitis, and the muscles of the two sides diverge, leaving a V-shaped gap, like the opening of a waistcoat, in which the com plexus is exposed. When the sheet is too broad for it all to gam an insertion

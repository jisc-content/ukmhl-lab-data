103 THE NECK As the boundaries of the three subordinate triangles into which the anterior triangle is divided have now been seen clearly, the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscles may be cut across and turned back. This will allow the external carotid artery and the hypoglossal nerve to be cleaned more thoroughly and traced as high as the parotid gland. The deep or postero-internal relations of the external carotid will be seen better when the jaw has been divided and turned up, but they should be made out as far as possible now. Postero-Internal Relations of the External Carotid Artery Bones.—(I) Great Cornu of Hyoid ; (2) Styloid Process. Muscles.—(1) Stylo-glossus; (2) Stylo-pharyngeus; (3 and 4) Superior and Middle Constrictors of the Pharynx. Fibrous Structures.—Stylo-hyoid Ligament. Arteries.—(1) Internal Carotid; (2) Ascending Pharyngeal. Veins.—Internal Jugular. Nerves.—(1) Glosso-pharyngeal; (2) Pharyngeal; and (3) Superior Laryngeal branches of Vagus. Most of these structures should be left until the jaw is reflected, but the following may be found at once:— The Superior Laryngeal Nerve [N. laryngeus superior] passes deep to both carotids and divides high up in the neck into external and internal branches. The Internal Laryngeal Branch is easily found, as it pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane close to the posterior border of the thyro-hyoid muscle and just above its accompanying artery. The External Laryngeal is a very small nerve which supplies the crico-thyroid muscle. It passes deep to the insertion of the sterno-thyroid, and the upper part of the posterior edge of this muscle is a con- venient place to pick up the nerve. As the muscle has already been divided, there will be no difliculty in tracing the

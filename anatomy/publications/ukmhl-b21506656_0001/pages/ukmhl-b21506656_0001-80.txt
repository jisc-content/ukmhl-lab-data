PRACTICAL ANATOMY 60 These two branches supply all the bony vault of the cranium as well as the dura mater. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus [S. sagittalis superior] may be seen easily in the mid line, and should be cut into posteriorly and then laid open on a probe or director. When its cavity has been sponged clean, it will be seen that it is triangular in section and is formed by a splitting of the S.L.S. Lac.Lat ach B.

Where the venous sinuses are, these two layers are separate and enclose the blood, but elsewhere they are so closely ioined as to be indistinguishable from one another. As the sinus is traced forwards, it becomes smaller, Avhile behind it gradually enlarges until the Torcnlar Herophili [confluens sinuum] or meeting-place of the smuses is reached. . i i„.„ In the side-wall of the slit sinus orifices, often valvular

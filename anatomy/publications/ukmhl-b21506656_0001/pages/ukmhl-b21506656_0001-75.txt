55 THE SCALP This is sometimes known as the " dangerous area of the scalp," because matter can so readily make its way in all directions between the aponeurosis and the pericranium. It is the existence of this space which allows the scalp to be so easily torn off in machinery accidents. Laterally the epicraniuni becomes still thinner, but gives origin to the anterior and superior auricular muscles, while the posterior rises from the bony mastoid process. HP.

Cut this through across one of the sutures, and, in lifting it up, notice how closely it is attached to the bone at the suture. Until the sutures are closed, a process which is usually complete internally about the fortieth year, it is continuous with the dura mater inside the skull; consequently any subpericranial effusion will be limited to the outline of one of the cranial bones. Reviewing the structure of the scalp it is evident that five layers must be recognised: (1) skin; (2) subcutaneous layer containing fat, hair follicles, vessels, and nerves, and

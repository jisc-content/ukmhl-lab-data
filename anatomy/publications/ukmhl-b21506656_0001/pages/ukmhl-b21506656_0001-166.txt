PRACTICAL ANATOMY 146 to sink gradually into tlie substance of the genio-liyo- glossus. Its dorsalis linguce branch comes off deep to the posterior part of the hyo-glossus, while sublingual branches are given to that gland in front of the muscle. The terminal part of the lingual is often spoken of as the ranine artery. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve needs some little care to find. First localise the styloid process and clean its posterior border; this will expose the origm of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, and winding round the posterior border of this muscle the nerve will be found. Notice that it is only about half the size of the hypo- glossal or lingual nerves. On reaching the posterior part of the hyo-glossus it passes deep to the dorsalis lingute artery, and here there is usually quite a plexus of veins coming from the tonsil, which hes deeper still at this spot. Among the veins, twigs [rami tonsillares] are seen running from the glosso-pharyngeal to form a nerve plexus for the tonsil and its neighbourhood. This is known as the circulus tonsillaris, but the nerves forming it are very small. The termination of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve may be traced through the substance of the genio-hyo-glossus to the back and sides of the tongue, dividing into numerous branches remarkable for their tortuosity. DISSECTION OF THE PAROTID GLAND [Gl. Parotis] The superficial aspect of the gland has been noticed in the dissection of the face. The auriculo-temporal nerve and superficial temporal vessels have been traced to its upper border; the facial nerve, Stensen's duct, and transverse facial artery to its anterior border. Below, the anterior and posterior divisions of the temporo- maxillary vein, and the great auricular nerve, have been seen

441 THE ANKLE-JOINT of the digital fossa behind the external malleolus; the liga- ment is attached rather strongly here, and its fibres radiate inwards, some running up to the lower border of the tibia, others downwards to the posterior border of the astragalus. The external lateral ligament consists of three strong, quite separate fasciculi, radiating from the external malleolus. The anterior fasciculus [lig. talo-fibulare anterius] runs nearly horizontally inwards to the neck of the astragalus. The middle fasciculus [lig. calcaneo-ftbulare] runs downwards and a little backwards from just in front of the tip of the malleolus to the outer side of the calcaneum, while the pos- terior fasciculus [lig, talo-fibulare posterius] runs from the digital fossa, again almost horizontally, to the outer lip of the groove for the flexor longus hallucis tendon behind the astragalus (see Fig. 187). The internal lateral ligament [lig. deltoideum] is a broad, fan-shaped sheet, the apex of which is attached to the in- ternal malleolus, while its base is attached, from before back- wards, to the tubercle of the navicular, the calcaneo-navicular ligament, the sustentaculum tali, and the inner side of the astragalus. Now cut through the capsule and turn the astragalus out of the bony arch which the tibia and fibula make for it. Notice particularly that its upper articular surface is broader in front than behind. If it were not for this a backward dislocation of the ankle would be of constant occurrence. There is httle need to impress on any one who has dissected the joint that the lateral hgaments are of infinitely greater importance than the anterior and posterior. Tarsal Joints First examine the transverse tarsal joint from the dorsum :of the foot. This is the articulation which runs across the foot, having the head of the astragalus and the anterior sur- . face of the calcaneum behind, and the navicular and cuboid

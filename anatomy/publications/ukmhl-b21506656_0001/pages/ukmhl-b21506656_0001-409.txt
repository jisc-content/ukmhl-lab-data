389 THE THIGH tion of the quadriceps extensor tendon. It is supplied by two or three nerves -which pierce its anterior surface; the innermost of these sends a long slender branch, to which reference has already been made, down along the line of separation between the crureus and vastus internus. It is the nerve to the subcrureus, and should not be traced farther until that muscle is exposed. Make a vertical median incision through the crureus right down to the bone, and turn the two parts aside. It will now be noticed that the muscle rises by a series, usually five, of transverse fleshy bars separated by loose connective tissue. Below the origin of the crureus the subcrureus is seen. It consists of three or four thin laminse, which arise one above the other from the anterior surface of the shaft of the femur below the origin of the crureus. It is inserted into the upper part of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. The nerve to the subcrureus should now be followed, when it Avill^ be seen to supply both the muscle and the adjacent synovial membrane. The Hip-joint It is now convenient to examine the hip-joint; after which the Hmb may be removed from the trunk. Cut through the various muscles covering the joint and reflect them upward and downward. In reflecting the ilio-psoas muscle a distinct bursa is usually seen, which in many cases will be found to communicate directly with the cavity of the joint. Further, the reflected head of the rectus femoris and the tendon of the gluteus minimus are more or less incor- porated with the capsule of the joint. Having cleared away surroundmg structures, the student should now clean the capsule, in which procedure considerable assistance will be obtamed by altering from time to time the position of the hmb. The capsule consists of fibres which pass from the circumference of the acetabulum above to the spiral line of

THE LARYNX 235 it and the posterior concave surface of the hyoid is a small bursa. This arrangement alloAvs the thyroid cartilage to be pulled up behind the body of the hyoid in deglutition. Though the ligament is very strong and elastic in the mid line, it fades away laterally, where it is pierced by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery; but from the tips of the superior comua of the thyroid the lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments [LI. hyothyreoidea lateralia] run up to the tips of the great cornua of the hyoid bone, and these are regarded as the thickened posterior edges of the membrane. In each of these a small knob of cartilage (cartilago- triticea) is sometimes found. The crico-thyroid memhrane [ligamentum crico-thyreoi- deum], like the thyro-hyoid, consists of median and lateral parts. Of these the median part really deserves its name, since it is attached below to the top of the anterior part of the ring of the cricoid, while above it is fastened to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, though, as this upper attachment is broader than the lower, the median part of the membrane is an inverted triangular sheet. The lateral part should be studied on both sides. On the side in which the thyroid cartilage has been left the membrane may be seen to pass up from the lateral part of the ring of the cricoid cartilage internal to the thyroid, and a forceps blade may be pushed up between the two structures for a little distance. On the other side, whence the thyroid cartilage has been removed, the membrane is seen to pass up deep to the crico- . arytenoideus laterahs, and if this muscle, as well as the thyro-arytenoideus, are cleared away, then it may be traced up to the true vocal cord; for this reason the cord is some- times described as the upper free edge of the lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane (see Fig. 107). The whole of this membrane, like the thyro-hyoid, is

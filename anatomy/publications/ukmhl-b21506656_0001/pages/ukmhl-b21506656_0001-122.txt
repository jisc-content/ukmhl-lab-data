PRACTICAL ANATOMY 102 The Hypoglossal or Twelfth Cranial Nerve is a most important structure. It runs down behind the external carotid artery and between it and the internal jugular vein until the level of the great cornu of the hyoid bone is reached; here it loops round the origin of the occipital artery, and sc.

It is easily found by following up the descendens hypoglossi nerve—its branch. Look carefully for a branch to the thyro- hyoid muscle coming off the hypoglossal soon after the origin of the ramus descendens hypoglossi. The nerve enters its muscle on the superficial aspect. Like the descendens hypoglossi, this nerve originally comes from the first cervical.

THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION 145 Veins.—Venae comites of these arteries. Nerves.—Glosso-pharyngeal. The lesser cormo of the hyoid is very easily defined, deep to the anterior border of the hyo-glossus; it is usually joined to the rest of the hyoid bone by fibrous tissue only, bony union being rare even in old people. The stylo-hyoid ligament runs from the tip of the lesser cornu to the tip of the styloid process, and is generally best marked in the lower part of its course. The middle constrictor of the pharynx [M. constrictor pharyngis mediusj is easily seen rising from the lower part of the stylo-hyoid ligament, from the lesser cornu of the hyoid, and from the outer edge of the great cornu as far as its tip; there is often a gap between the parts coming from the lesser and greater cornua. The genio-hyo-glossus muscle [M. genio-glossus] has been partly exposed already in lifting up the sublingual gland. Finish cleaning its surface, and notice that it rises from the upper genial tubercle near the mid line of the mandible. Its upper fibres are lost in the front of the tongue, but those which are lower run back deep to the hyo-glossus, and a few may even reach the top of the body of the hyoid bone, though their attachment here is of the slightest. A few vertical fibres will probably be made out as a little bundle running up from the lesser cornu of the hyoid, and partly concealing the hinder end of the genio-hyo-glossus; these form the little chondro-glossus, and are always to be seen if looked for (see Fig. 70). Twigs from the hypoglossal nerve are easily traced into the genio-hyo-glossus. The lingual artery runs a wavy course forwards, deep to the hyo-glossus, lying just above the great cornu of the hyoid bone and just below the line of the hypoglossal nerve. Here the middle constrictor is deep to it. When it reaches the anterior border of the hyo-glossus, it runs upwards and forwards, deep to the hypoglossal nerve and Wharton's duct V/-\T T '

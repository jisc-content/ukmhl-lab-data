240 PRACTICAL ANATOMY at, since it is seldom possible to remove the neck below the disc between the first and second thoracic vertebrae. The scalenus anticus [M. scalenus anterior] has already been studied, and most of its relations noticed (see p. 157). It will be seen now that its posterior relations are the sub- clavian artery (second part), the brachial plexus, and the scalenus medius. The rectus capitis anticus major [M. longus capitis] rises from the same anterior tubercles of the cervical verte- brse to which the scalenus anticus and the upper obhque part of the longus colli are attached, namely, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical. It is interesting to notice how sharply all these prevertebral muscles stop at the carotid tubercle of the sixth cervical vertebra. The insertion of the rectus capitis anticus major is into the basilar process of the occipital bone, outside and behind the pharyngeal spine. Cut the last muscle and expose the rectus capitis antwus minor [M. rectus capitis anterior], rising from the lateral mass of the atlas in front of the articular facet, and runmng upwards and inwards, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, just behind and a little internal to the insertion of the major muscle. Between the anterior and posterior tubercles of adjacent cervical transverse processes are small anterior and posterior intertransverse muscles, which are of only the slightest prac- tical importance. The posterior set of these muscles, however, are con- tinued up from the transverse process of the atlas by the rectus capitis lateralis muscle, which has already been noticed several times. It runs up to be inserted into the iugular process of the occipital bone, and it is weU worth while spending a few minutes in reviewing its numerous and important relations. / On the outer side of the rectus capitis lateralis are tne occipital artery and sometimes the spinal accessory nerve.

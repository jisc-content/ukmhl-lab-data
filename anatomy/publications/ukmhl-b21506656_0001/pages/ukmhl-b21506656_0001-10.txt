VI PREFACE after the name at present used, in every case in which the two differ. We are very grateful to the numerous clinicians and specialists who have been kind enough to read through various parts of the work and to advise us on points of detail possessmg practical value. To Dr. Box, Mr. Sargent, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Marriage, and Dr. Wood Jones we are especially indebted. We may justly claim that, after deciding how much we could leave out, our endeavour has been to lay stress, firstly, on the technical methods of displaying the various structures successfully; and, secondly, on the positions and relations of structures which experience shows are of practical importance. In preparing the illustrations the help of Messrs. Bluett, Cowtan, Morris, and Vevers was of the greatest value to us. All these gentlemen have been our own students, and all the figures which show any artistic merit were drawn by one or other of them. The others are either diagrams or outlme sketches made by ourselves with the aid of a diagraph. In a certain number of cases the illustrations are a reproduction of the dissection which the student is making, but this is only when we have doubted Avhether he will recognise the various structures from the description m the text. â€¢ More often the illustration is arranged to show the parts from a somewhat different point of view to the one seen in the student's dissection, in order to help him to acquire a sense of topography.

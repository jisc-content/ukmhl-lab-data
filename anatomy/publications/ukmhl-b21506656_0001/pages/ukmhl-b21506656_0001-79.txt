INTRACRANIAL REGION 59 INTRACRANIAL REGION I When the soft parts have been cleared off the vault of I the skull the sutures are seen, and even in the skulls of quite old people are sometimes patent superficially. The ' sagittal suture closes earliest and most completely between I the parietal foramina, while the coronal does so below the point where the temporal ridge crosses it. Closure at these points occurs between the thirtieth and fortieth years. Screw the coronet on to the skull a little above the i supraciliary eminences in front, and about an inch above the ! external occipital protuberance behind. Saw through the : external table all round, keeping the saw close to the I coronet. As soon as any sign of blood is seen on the saw it I shows that the diploe has been reached, and the cut should go no deeper there, though in bodies injected with formalin ' this sign is often wanting. The best kind of chisel to use for the rest of the work is one which is bent at a right angle near the cutting edge ; this can be used as a lever and hook I for dragging the vault off when it is nearly divided, but if one of these is not provided, an ordinary chisel and mallet should be carefully used. The Dura Matee lies quite close to the inner surface of I the cranium, but if enough care is taken it should not be damaged, and its outer aspect may be studied as soon as the I skull-cap is removed. ' This outermost and thickest membrane of the brain acts also as the internal periosteum of the skull bones, and between I the membrane and the skull the meningeal arteries lie. They are accompanied by veins which, much more than the arteries, are responsible for the grooves in the skull bones. The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery [A. i meningea media] will be found coming up from the pterion and usually lying in a canal in the parietal bone a little ' below the point of section, while the posterior branch is I some inches further back.

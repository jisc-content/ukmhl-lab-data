408 PRACTICAL ANATOMY joint; it is known as the communicating a/rtery, but is not always present. The flexor longus hallucis muscle arises from the lower two-thirds of the posterior surface of the fibula. The flexor longus digitorum muscle arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line and internal to the vertical line. The tibialis posticus arises from the internal surface of the fibula and from the posterior surface of the tibia, external to the vertical line, as well as from the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane. The insertion of these muscles will be seen later. It should be noticed that the flexor longus hallucis is fleshy nearly as far as the ankle; this fact serves at a glance to distinguish it from the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum, which have comparatively long tendons (Fig. 174). Behind the inner malleolus the position of the structures is very important, on account of tenotomy operations. The tibialis posticus is the innermost tendon and lies nearest the bone. The flexor longus digitorum lies posterior and a little external to. it. Then come the posterior tibial vessels, the nerve lying to their outer side; while still more external is the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. All these three tendons have synovial sheaths, which are continued up as far as the junction of the tendon with the flesh. The muscular mass of the flexor longus hallucis should now be carefully divided near its inner border by a vertical incision, thereby exposing the Peroneal Artery [a. peron:ea], which descends in an osseo-muscular tunnel between the muscle and the shaft of the fibula. Two inches or so above the level of the ankle-joint a large branch usually leaves the peroneal artery, and, piercing the interosseous membrane, enters the anterior tibio-fibular compartment, where, as the anterior peroneal artery, it has already been studied. The rest of the peroneal artery becomes the extei^al calcaneal (see Fig. 174).

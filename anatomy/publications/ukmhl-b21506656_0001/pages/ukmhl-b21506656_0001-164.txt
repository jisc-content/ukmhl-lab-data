PRACTICAL ANATOMY 144 be traced forward to near the mid line, where it opens into the floor of the mouth on the papilla already noticed (see p. 126). Clean the surface of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle in front of the hyo-glossus, and notice the hypoglossal nerve breaking up to supply the various muscles of the tongue.

Define the anterior and posterior borders of the hyo- glossus, and then cut that muscle through horizontally and reflect it up and down. Its deep relations will now be seen. They are:— Bones.—The lesser cornu of the Hyoid. Muscles.—W\M\q Constrictor of the Pharynx, Genio-hyo- glossus and Inferior Lingualis. Fibrous ^^ruc^wres.—Stylo-hyoid ligament. ^r^eries.—Lingual and its dorsalis linguae branch.

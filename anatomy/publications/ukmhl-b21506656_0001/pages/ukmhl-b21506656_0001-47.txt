THE SPINAL CORD 27 the antero-median fissure [Fissura mediana anterior] of the cord into which the deeper layer of the pia mater is reflected. A nttle distance to each side of the mid ventral Ime is the antero-lateral sulcus [S. lateralis anterior] where the anterior nerve roots emerge. Apart from the exit oi tJae nerve roots the sulcus would hardly be noticeable. A.Sp.A. A.M.F. A.L.S. A.N.R. P.N.R P.M.S. \ Para.M.S. P.L.S.

Working round to the back, the posterior nerve roots are seen entering the postero-lateral sulcus [S. lateralis posterior], which is rather better marked than the antero-lateral, and the bundles of posterior roots lie in a single line while those of the anterior form a double line. It is, however, quite difficult to distinguish the two roots in this way. Just behind the posterior roots are the posterior spinal arteries, of which there ar^6^*5^«^on either side. They

227 THE TONGUE is seen to blend with the stylo-glossus in front of the hyo- glossus. The inferior lingualis is sometimes said to be attached to the body of the hyoid bone posteriorly, but the author, in a large number of dissections, has never been able to see this. A section passing upwards from the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone will probably display the little chondo-'o-glossus Fig. 103.—Diagrammatic Transverse Section of Tongue to SHOW THE EbLATIONS OP THE SUBLINGUAL GlAND.

As the tip of the tongue is approached, the cqyical glands (of Nuhn) [Gl. linguahs anterior] should be looked for on the lower surface, one on each side of the mid line. To expose these a part of the musculature of the tongue must be removed. Notice how closely the mucous membrane is bound to the muscular tissue on the dorsum and sides of the tongue, but below and on the posterior surface a good deal of sub- mucous tissue is present.

In the superficial plexus those nerves coming from the second and third cervical give ofif three ascending branches— the small occipital, great auricular, and transverse cervical; while those coming from the third and fourth descend and become the suprasternal, supraclavicular, and supra-acromial G.A.

All these emerge deep ta the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and have already been studied. Of the deep part of the plexus some branches run in towards the anterior triangle 'and some out towards the posterior. They are all either muscular or communicating. Those running inwards consist of— A. Muscular twigs to the prevertebral muscles. Some of these from the four upper cervical nerves go to the rectus capitis anticus major, while from the first cervical is a

31 THE SPINAL CORD enlargement of the cord, which differs from the cervical in having its antero-posterior and transverse diameters nearly equal, so that, although the cord is enlarged, the flattened appearance so characteristic of the cervical enlargement is wantnisf- A striking feature is the much greater proportion of grey to white matter than in either of the other regions. The anterior horns are actually larger than those of the cervical enlargement, but the thing which enables the experienced eye at once to recognise the lumbar cord is the massive appear- ance of the posterior horns. The dissector will, of course, re- member that the lumbar enlargement is situated in the lower thoracic region of the spmal canal. A section through the conus medul- laris, whence the lower sacral nerves are rising, shows a still further increase of grey matter at the expense of white, the anterior and posterior horns are practi- cally equal in size, while the grey commissure is very much thicker than in any other region.

Interior of the Spinal Canal After the spinal cord has been removed, the empty dural sheath should be reviewed and its limits, particularly its lower one at the level of the second or third sacral vertebra, more carefully determined. It should then be carefully removed from above down- wards, and the anterior part of the extradural 2'>lci^uts of veins looked for. The veins of this plexus are numerous, thin-walled and, especially in the lumbar region, tortuous. Two anterior longitudinal spinal veins should be sought,

THE BRAIN 279 is desirable to do this before the brain is placed in any hardening re-agent. Now take the brain belonging to the dissector's part, and clear away the membranes and arteries completely from the outer side of one hemisphere in order to study the topo- graphy of its surface. The reason for giving this advice is that if the arteries and membranes are examined first they will have to be studied in relation to parts of the brain of which the student at present knows nothing.; The Outer Surface of the Cerebrum Before beginning the study of the surface of the brain the dissector should clearly understand that the fissures and convolutions are never exactly alike in any two brains, nor are the two sides of any single brain quite identical. The following directions, therefore, are intended for an average brain, and in all cases of difficulty the help of a demonstrator should be sought. First identify the three main fissures, putting a little coloured wool into each as it is found. The Fissure of Sylvius [F. cerebri lateralis] runs back- wards and upwards, and separates the tongue-like Temporal Lobe below from the rest of the outer surface of the cere- brum. At its posterior end it turns rather sharply upwards. The anterior part of it is very wide and deep, and is known as the stem or Vallecula Sylvii [fossa cerebri lateralis]. About an inch from the tip of the temporal lobe is the Sylvian Point, from which a short anterior limb of the fissure [ramus anterior horizontalis] passes horizontally for- wards, another short ascending limb [ramus anterior ascen- dens] passes nearly vertically upwards, and the third or posterior limb [ramus posterior], already described, passes backwards. This Sylvian point lies against the pterion on the surface

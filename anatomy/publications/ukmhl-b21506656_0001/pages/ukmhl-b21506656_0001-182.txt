162 PRACTICAL ANATOMY bral artery used to be ligatured, and the risk of injuring the duct was then great. Now, however, ligature of the vertebral is one of the rarest of surgical operations. On the other hand, that of the inferior thyroid artery is becoming increasingly common in the treatment of goitre.

It will now be seen that the thoracic duct, usually in two parts, makes a loop over the left subclavian artery in front of the root of the vertebral artery and behind the vertebral vein, and it is in the course of this loop that it receives the jugular duct running down from the deep cervical nodes and, more externally, the subclavian duct coming inwards

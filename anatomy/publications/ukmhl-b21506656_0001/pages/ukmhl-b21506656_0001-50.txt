30 PRACTICAL ANATOMY Now make a section Ventral The posterior median fissure, on the other hand, though much narroAver, reaches the grey commissure. through the cervical en- largement of the cord whence the big nerves for the brachial plexus come off. Here the transverse diameter is much greater than the antero-posterior, measuring 12 to 14 mm. The anterior horns are Fig. 14.—Diagrammatic Section of much broader than in the Spinal Cord through the Cer- ^y^^^,^qIq region, and are vicAL ENLARGEMENT. prolonged outwards for a considerable distance, the outward prolongation being some- times known as the lateral horn [columna laterahs]. The posterior horns are narrower and do not bulge near the grey commissure, since Clarke's column is practi- cally confined to the thoracic region Dorsal Ventral In the white matter the para-median sulcus is best seen in this region, and a dehcate septum may some- times be made out running forwards and inwards from it, cutting off the column of Goll [fasciculus gracilis], Section of which lies close to tne spx^^l cord through the Lumbar postero-median fissure, from Enlargement. the column of Burdach [fasciculus cuneatus] lying between the septum and the posterior horn (see Fig. 12). , , r, .i,, i„mbar A section should next be made through the lumbar Dorsal

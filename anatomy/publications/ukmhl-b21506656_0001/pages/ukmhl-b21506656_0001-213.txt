193 THE PHARYNX pharyngeus is exposed. This, on reaching the soft palate, divides into a small upper layer, which is the highest of all the muscles on the nasal surface of the velum, and a larger, deeper layer which lies below the levator palati and azygos uvulae and above the tensor palati. Below the palato- pharyngeus joins the stylo-pharyngeus and has the same insertion (see Fig. 106). It is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus of nerves. At this point it will be well to review the various layers of muscles met with in the soft palate; they are, from above downwards : (1) Palato-pharyngeus (superficial layer); (2) Azygos uvulae ; (3) Levator palati; (4) Palato-pharyngeus (lower main layer); (5) Tensor palati; (6) Palato-glossus. In clearing off the mucous membrane from the oral surface of the soft palate, some small arteries will probably be seen coming through the accessory palatine canal or canals; they are branches of the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery and help in the arterial supply of the tonsil. The sensory nerves are very small, and accompany the arteries through the accessory palatine foramina; they are branches of Meckel's ganglion. Nasal Foss^ Each nasal cavity, when seen in a coronal section, is a right-angled triangle, the right angle being between the inner wall or septum and floor. As the section which has been made is a sagittal instead of a coronal one, just to one side of the septum, the outer wall will be seen on one side and the septum on the other. On the septal wall is a very thick mucous membrane, which in its upper third belongs to the olfactory region, is non-ciliated, and has branches of the olfactory nerve dis- tributed to it. In the lower two-thirds it is respiratory in function, ciliated, and very vascular. Running obliquely

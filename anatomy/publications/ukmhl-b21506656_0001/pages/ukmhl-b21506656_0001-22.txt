2 PRACTICAL ANATOMY along the superior curved line, and are exposing the trapezius muscle. Retlect the flap of skin 1, 2, 3 (Fig. 1) outwards. Take a point one-third of the way from the external occipital protuberance to the tip of the mastoid process, that is to say, about an inch and a half from the former point. Here the great occipital nerve and the occipital artery enter Fig. 1.â€”Skin Incisions for the Dissection of the Head and Neck. the scalp, and will be found with two or three lymph nodes lying close to them though on a more superficial plane.

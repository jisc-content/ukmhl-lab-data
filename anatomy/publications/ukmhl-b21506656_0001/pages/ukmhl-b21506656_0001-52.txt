32 PRACTICAL ANATOMY one on each side, behind the bodies of the vertebrae. These are connected by cross branches opposite the bodies of the vertebri-e, passing between them and the posterior common hgament so that the arrangement is sometimes spoken of as the spinal venous ladder. Each anterior longitudinal vein receives the veins emerg- ino- from the cord and sends communicating branches back to the dorsal extradural plexus already noticed (see p. 19). Besides this, at each intervertebral foramen a draining branch runs outwards to the vertebral, intercostal, or lumbar vein as the case may be. Notice the Posterior common ligament [Lig. longitudinale posterius] which runs down behind the bodies of the verte- bra. It begins at the back of the body of the axis, but above that its continuation is known as the posterior occipito- axial ligament. In the cervical region it is ribbon-like, but in theÂ°thoracic and lumbar it becomes serrated, widenmg out opposite the discs where it is attached and narrowmg opposite the centra, from which it is separated by the trans- verse connecting branches of the extradural plexus. These latter of course represent the rungs of the ladder m the simile already suggested. Cut through the ligament opposite the bodies ot one or two lumbar vertebrae, and notice that the transverse vems receive large tributaries, called vence basis vertehxe, commg out of the foramina in the bodies of the vertebrae and being of considerable importance, since the cancellous tissue of the vertebral centra is the chief seat of the blood-forming red marrow. At this stage the body should be turned upon its back. DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF THE NECK It is important that the posterior triangle should not be left long undissected. because, as soon as the dissectors of the

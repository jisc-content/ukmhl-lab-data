THE LOWER EXTREMITY As soon as the body comes into the room the dissector should carefully wrap the lower extremity in some air-tight material, such as oiled hneli or india-rubber tissue, and bandage this on tightly. During the first seven days, while the body is on its face, the gluteal region, popliteal space, and as much as possible of the back of the thigh should be dissected. DISSECTION OF THE GLUTEAL REGION OR BUTTOCK The Buttock is the protuberant region seen posteriorly at the junction of the thigh and trunk. Its prominence is partly due to muscle, partly to fat. Note that the buttocks are separated from each other by the deep natal cleft m which lies the anus. The sides of the cleft are covered with a variable amount of hair. The buttock is sharply limited below by a crescentic creaseâ€”the fold of the vates, the con- cavity of which looks upward. On all other sides the buttock fades without any definite line of demarcation into surrounding parts. The skin of the buttock is thick and coarse. , , n . Before reflecting the skin the student should determine the position of various bony prominences. The crest of the ilium separates the buttock from the flank; trace it forwards by pressure with the finger to the anterior superior ihac spine, and backwards to the posterior superior iliac spme; the position of the latter point is often more obvious o the eye than to the finger, lying as it does immediately

62 PRACTICAL ANATOMY is a mere cleft, the dura mater and arachnoid being in contact. Separate the two lobes of the cerebrum gently and look for the falx cerebri, a median septum .of the dura mater lying between them. This, as its name implies, is sickle- shaped, and becomes gradually deeper as it runs back. Divide it with scissors as close as possible to the crista galli, and reflect it. Now let the head hang well back, and gently lift the frontal lobes from the anterior fossa of the skull until the olfactory bulbs are seen lying on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. In the post-mortem room the object is to remove every part of the brain, but in the dissecting room,- since it is almost always possible to get another brain, it is better to divide the olfactory tract on one side, thus leaving one lobe in position. Continue drawing back the frontal lobes until the optic nerves and commissure come into view. Just to the outer side of these will be seen the large internal carotid arteries, which should be divided close to the brain. The optic nerves, too, should be divided close to the commissure. Still drawing the front of the brain gently back, the infundihulum, or stalk of the pituitary body, comes into view and must be cut through. Now turn the head as much as possible to one side, and raise the temporal lobe of the other side from the middle fossa of the skull. men the upper border of the petrous bone is reached, a membrane will be seen running back from it, separating the cerebral hemisphere from the cerebellum: this is the tentorium cerehelli. As the mid line is approached it will be seen that the tentorium has a free edge boundmg an openina sometimes known as the foramen ovale of the tentorium, through which the crura cerebri pass up to the cerebral hemispheres.

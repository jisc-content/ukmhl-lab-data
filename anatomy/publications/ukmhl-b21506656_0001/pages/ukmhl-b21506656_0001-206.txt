186 • PRACTICAL ANATOMY The posterior surface of the tongue consists of a mass of low tubercular swellings, caused by masses of lymphoid tissue deep to the mucous membrane. Most of these have little dark specks at their centres, which are the openings of small mucous crypts, and into these a fine seeker may be pushed for a little distance. This mass of lymphoid tissue on the back of the tongue is sometimes known as the lingual tonsil. Lying against the posterior surface of the tongue, and nearly reaching the uvula, is the epiglottis, a leaf-shaped cartilage, which will be examined later with the larynx. In°swallowing, the larynx is drawn up to the epiglottis, and the tongue comes back, but the epiglottis is curved in such a way that the food passes over its posterior surface near the tip, and it is only its lower part which actually forms a lid to the larynx. . • i i Press the tongue forward, draw the epiglottis back- ward and notice the glosso-epiglottic fold of mucous mem- brane, which is median, and passes from the epiglottis to the tongue. ' . ■, j; A There are also two lateral folds which pass forward and outward from the epiglottis to the pharyngeal wall close to the tonsil, and are known as plmryngo-epiglotiic ■^""^'Between these three folds are two shallow pouches known as the Vallecul(2, into which the point of an instrument may be passed by an inexpert operator when trying to re-ch the larynx, and in which small foreign bodies, hke fish bones, occasionallv become lodged. rTom the latffl-al margins of the epiglottis the aryUno- ,pigloUid,an folds [phca. aryepiglottioje] of ^"ucous men> fskgCenr^^^^^^^^^^ '^L^-rplS^eS Z.. an .al s.e,., caused by lymphoid tissue, in which ,s embedded the bttle

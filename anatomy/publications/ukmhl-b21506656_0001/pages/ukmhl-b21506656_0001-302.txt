282 PRACTICAL ANATOMY The Occipital Lobe is arbitrarily marked off by drawing a line downwards and a little forwards from the external parieto-occipital fissure to the lower margin of the brain. In children's brains and in those of adults hardened by forma- tion in situ there is sometimes a little indentation, the p?'e- occipital notch, in this position, but it is so inconstant as to Fig. 125.â€”The Lobes of the Cerebrum. F.R. Fissure of Rolando, in front of which is the Frontal Lobe. E P.O.F. External Parieto-occipital Fissure, between which and the Fissure of Rolando is the Parietal Lobe, and behind which is the Occipi- tal Lobe. V.S. Vallecula Sylvii, in which is the Central Lobe, and below which is the Temporal Lobe. be of little practical value. When it is present it is used as the mark for the lower limit of the boundary of the occipital lobe. The Temporal Lobe is bounded above by the stem of the Sylvian fissure and its posterior horizontal limb. Where this turns up the line of the posterior Hmb is continued back until it cuts the arbitrary line marking off the front of the occipital lobe. Posteriorly this arbitrary line separates it

THE KNEE-JOINT 437 fibrous membrane—the coronary ligament—which is attached to its lower and outer border all the way round except where the popliteus tendon passes it; here the coronary ligament fails, and the synovial membrane of the knee is prolonged down the deep surface of the tendon as has already been noticed. Clear away the internal condyle in the same way as the external, and contrast the internal semilunar cartilage P.C.L. Fig. 185.—Intra-akticdlar Structures of Left Knee-joint. P.C.L.

Notice that it is a much more open crescent, its anterior cornu being attached in front of the anterior crucial ligament, while behind its posterior cornu fixes it to the tibia behind the posterior attachment of the external semilunar cartilage, but in front of the posterior crucial ligament. The internal semilunar cartilage is narrower than the external except in its posterior third, where it usually broadens out. There are two other points of difference of

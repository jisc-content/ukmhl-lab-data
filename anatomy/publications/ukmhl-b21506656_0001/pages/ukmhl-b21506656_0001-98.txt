PRACTICAL ANATOMY 78. A hole drilled 1 inch horizontally behind the middle of the upper margin of the external auditory meatus usually strikes the anterior part of the sinus, though it is important to reahse that the exact position of the latter structure varies a good deal. Many surgeons prefer to take the line at which the skin over the mastoid process is reflected on to the back of the auricle as a working guide to the position of the sigmoid sinus. The interior of the sinus should be cleaned out, and its posterior wall carefully examined for the mastoid emissary vein, which communicates with the occipital vein through the mastoid foramen, about 1 inch below the asterion. The foramen, though sometimes absent, is often of large size, and its emissary vein may cause serious trouble in operations about this region. The last part of the sinus runs inwards and then turns forwards to reach the jugular foramen at its most external and posterior compartment through which it turns sharply downwards to join the inferior petrosal sinus outside the skull. This latter sinus passes through the antero-internal compartment of the foramen, while the middle compart- ment is occupied by the three nerves. Of these the glosso-pharyngeal has a separate aperture in the dura mater in front of that for the vagus and spinal accessory. In the mid line of the posterior fossa of the cramum the smsiW falx cerehelli is found, contmuous with the under sur- face of the tentorium, and having the small occipital simos between its layers, where it is attached to the internal occipital crest. Lay this sinus open and notice that, as it approaches the foramen magnum, it bifurcates, and that each branch skirts the margin of the foramen to join the lateral smus iust before its disappearance. Above the hind margin of the foramen magnum there

THE NECK 155 to the sternum. This will open a synovial cavity, but the clavicle does not bound it externally, because there is an interarticular fibro-cartilage or meniscus [discus articularis] which is attached to the clavicle above and to the junction of the first rib cartilage with the sternum below, while in front and behind it blends with the capsule. This may be demonstrated by cutting through the capsule on the outer Fig. 77.â€”Sterno-olavicdlar Articulation. A Coronal Section has been made on the Eight Side, Ant.Lig. Anterior Ligament. I.C.Lig.

First Rib. side of the meniscus, and noticing that the two synovial cavities are quite separate. The posterior part of the capsule is just like the anterior, except that it is not so strong. Disarticulate the clavicle by cutting through the menis- cus, the remains of the capsule, and the costo-clavicular ligament. When this is done the clavicle, or what is left of it by the dissectors of the upper extremity, may be lifted up with the sterno-mastoid attached, but great care should be taken in freeing the clavicle not to injure the subclavian and innominate veins which lie just behind it.

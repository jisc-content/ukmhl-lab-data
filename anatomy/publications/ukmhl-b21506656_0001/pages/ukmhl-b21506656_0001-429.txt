THE FOOT 409 THE FOOT THE DORSUM OF THE FOOT The skin should now be reflected from the dorsum of the foot. Make a longitudinal incision in the median line and a transverse incision at the root of the toes. The flaps can then be reflected inward and outward. Median incisions may also be made through the skin on the dorsum of the toes and the skin similarly treated. In the superficial fascia now exposed search should be made for the sub- cutaneous vessels and nerves. The most obvious vessels are the veins, which, forming a distinct arch known as the dorsal venous arch, are continued upwards on the inner and outer aspects of the dorsum as the internal and external saphenous veins respectively. The former passes in front of the internal malleolus, the latter behind the external malle- olus. In close relationship to these two veins will be found corresponding nervesâ€”the internal and external saphenous. These two nerves should now be traced to their termination. The former of "the two nerves will be found to end in most cases about half-way along the inner border of the foot branches being given off on either side to supply the adjacent portions of skin. The external saphenous nerve, on the other hand, can be traced to the outer border of the little toe, while not infrequently it may be seen to supply in addition the adjacent sides of the 4th and 5th toes (see Fig. 175). When this is the case, it will always be found that the communicans fibularis component of the external saphenous (see p. 360) is particularly large; the explanation being that fibres which usually run with the musculo-cutaneous branch of the external popliteal nerve accompany in these cases the external saphenous vid the communicans fibularis. Midway between the two saphenous nerves lies another large cutaneous nerve already met in the dissection of the

PLATE XLII. THE SUBOCCIPITAL TRIANGLE. In this dissection the trapezius was completely removed on the right side to expose the complexus and splenius, on the left the splenius was cut away from its origin from the ligamentum nuchse and supraspinous ligament and turned outwards, showing its division into splenius colli and capitis. The complexus was then divided about its centre, and the ends turned up and down to expose the suboccipital triangle which lies beneath it. The suboccipital triangle corresponds to the space between the inferior curved line of the occiput and the level of the spine of the axis, and is bounded Internally.—By the rectus capitis posticus major and minor. Externally.—By the superior oblique. Below.—By the inferior oblique. Floor.—Formed by the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament and the posterior arch of the atlas. Contents.—Suboccipital nerve and its branches to the recti postici, obliques, and complexus; vertebral artery with some muscular branches and the commencement of the vertebral vein. The following diagram shows the arrangement of the posterior primary branches of the upper cervical nerves. It may be remembered as a general rule that all the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves as far as the sixth dorsal (thoracic) give off cutanecus branches, while the external supply muscles. Below, this arrangement is reversed, the outer branches giving off the cutaneous twigs, and the internal, muscular ; the exceptions being the first cervical, which does not split, and the first two lumbar, which supply no skin branches at all.

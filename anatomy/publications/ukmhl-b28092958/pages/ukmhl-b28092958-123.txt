PLATE XXVIII. THE SACRAL PLEXUS In this plate the sacral plexus is shown exposed by removing parts of the ilium and sacrum by means of two saw-cutsâ€”one from the top of the great sacro-sciatic notch obliquely upwards and inwards, and the other downwards along the edge of the sacrum, so planned as to avoid cutting into the sacral foramina. The pyriformis has been drawn out of the pelvis, and rests on the posterior surface of the ischium. The great sacro- sciatic ligament has been cut and turned down, while the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament and the coccygeus muscle with which it is intimately connected are divided together. The accompanying diagram shows a fairly usual arrangement of the sacral plexus; the parts shaded indicate the posterior branches, the light the anterior (as in the brachial plexus). The sacral plexus presents many varieties, and the above must only be regarded as a fairly normal arrangement.

PLATE LXI.-LXII. SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF THE FRONT OF THE ABDOMEN. This plate shows a dissection of the front of the abdomen : the left side after removal of the subcutaneous tissue; and the right with the external oblique divided longitudinally near the junction of muscle and aponeurosis, and the ends reflected to show the internal oblique. It also shows well the way in which the external oblique muscle arises from the ribs by means of serrations. The deep layer of the super- ficial fascia is thin and membranous, re- quiring great care in dissection to preserve it. It is called the fascia of Scarpa, and unlike the superficial layer, which is con- tinuous with that of the limbs, it is bound down to the fascia lata along the line of Poupart’s ligament, passing centrally into the dartoid tissue of the scrotum, becoming inseparable from it, and thence is continued into the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia. Thus extravasation of urine can pass freely from the perineum into the scrotum and on to the abdomen, but is prevented from creeping down the legs. The external abdominal ring is a triangular interval left between the fibres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. The upper edge or pillar is sharp, and passes to its insertion in front of the body of the pubes; while the lower edge or pillar is rounded (it is the inner end of Poupart’s ligament), and is attached to the spine of the pubes. The base of the triangle is formed by the outer part of the pubic crest. Through the ring issues the cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The two pillars are bound together by the intercolumnar fascia, which also forms a covering to the cord and testis under the name of the external spermatic fascia. Note.—In this diagram the artist has carried the outline of the splenic flexure too much to the left. On reference to the section given on page 126, it will be seen that the summit of the splenic flexure has been cut by the mid-Poupart perpendicular line.

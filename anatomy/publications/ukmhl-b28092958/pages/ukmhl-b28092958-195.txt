PLATE XLVI. THIRD VIEW OF PTERYGOID REGION AND ORBIT FROM THE OUTER SIDE. In the dissection represented in this plate the capsule of the temporo-mandibular joint has been cut, and the condyle of the jaw, its inierarticular cartilage, and the external pterygoid have been pulled forwards to expose the third division of the fifth nerve which lies behind it. Two saw cuts have been made through the outer wall of the orbit parallel to the floor and roof, and the outer wall partly cut away and partly turned forwards. In chipping away the posterior part to allow a better view, the dura mater of the middle fossa of the skull has been exposed. In the plate the stylo-mastoid artery is shown as a branch from the occipital; this is not unfrequently the case when the vessel is not given off by the post-auricular.

PLATE II. THE AXILLA, DEEP VIEW. The pectoralis major has been cut across about its centre, and the ends turned inwards and outwards in order to expose the pectoralis minor and the deeper parts of the axilla. The costo-coracoid membrane was extremely thin, and was removed with the fibro-areolar tissue lying between its lower edge and the upper border of the pectoralis minor ; the sheath of the vessels was also removed. It is a deeper dissection of the same axilla, as in Plate I. The plate shows well the doubling up of the fibres of the pectoralis major at their insertion, the inferior fibres of origin being folded up so as to lie beneath the upper ones, thus having a higher insertion into the humerus along the outer border of the bicipital groove. It also shows a fibrous intersection, not uncommonly found running between the pectoralis minor and the coraco-brachialis muscles from the tip of the coracoid process. In this body the intercosto-humeral, instead of giving a branch to join the nerve of Wrisberg (6), receives one from it (16), the nerve of Wrisberg being much larger than usual. The costo-coracoid membrane is a fibrous structure, varying much in thickness in different subjects, which is attached above to the borders of the inferior surface of the clavicle, thus enclosing the subclavius muscle. Its lower border is condensed into a fibrous band, the costo-coracoid ligament, which stretches between the cartilage of the first rib and the coracoid process. The membrane is stronger externally, forming a fairly strong band between the clavicle and the coracoid process. Its deep surface is blended with the sheath of the axillary vessels. This latter is funnel-shaped and derived from the deep cervical fascia covering the scaleni muscles. The costo-coracoid ligament is a representative of the prolonged coracoid element seen in monotremes, etc.; it frequently contains cartilage nodules. (Bland Sutton.)

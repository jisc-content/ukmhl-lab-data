PLATE LIX. THE SECOND VIEW OF THE PERINEUM. In this dissection the deep layer of the superficial fascia (Coliesâ€™s) has been re- moved to expose the structures lying between it and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, while on the left side the crus and erector penis muscles have been cut through to expose completely the anterior layer of the ligament. Between the fascia of Colles and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament the following structures are contained: the transversus perinei muscles behind; the crura and erector muscles along the rami; in the middle line the accelerator urinae covering the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum ; and the superficial perineal vessels and nerves. The central fixed point of the perineum is situated about an inch in front of the anus, and is the meeting-place of the following structures: the transversus perinei, levator ani, accelerator urinse, and sphincter ani muscles ; the latter is the most super- ficial, and is attached about this point to the fascia of Colles and the subcutaneous tissue. This central point is important clinically, for a knife sunk in the centre line and carried a little backwards and upwards would open up the membranous urethra, and it is just behind this point that the knife is entered in perineal lithotomy. The levator ani was primarily a depressor of the tail, but atrophy of that organ and the enlargement of the pelvic outlet have modified the muscle. Its hinder part, attached to the coccyx, is the coccygeus muscle, while the rest forms a diaphragm for the pelvic outlet. The superficial sphincter is also a subcaudal slip segmented from the levator (Macalister).

PLATE IV, THE BEND OF THE ELBOW. In this plate is delineated the arrangement of the superficial veins and cutaneous nerves at the bend of the elbow; the basilic vein has been afterwards traced up to the point where it pierces the deep fascia to join the venae comites of the brachial artery. The common arrangement of these veins is as follows :—the median vein {a), which begins in radicals over the ball of the thumb, runs up the middle of the forearm, and divides into two about the lower border of the bicipital fascia—an inner branch, the median basilic (e), and an outer, the median cephalic (b)—giving off a branch (h) which pierces the deep fascia of the arm to join the deep veins. The median cephalic is joined just above the outer condyle by the radial vein (c), which begins in radicals upon the dorsal aspect of the first interosseous space, and runs up the outer side of the forearm pos- teriorly, turning forwards at the elbow to join the median cephalic. The conjoined vein is then termed cephalic (d); it runs up along the outer side of the biceps, piercing the fascia opposite the insertion of the deltoid, and, coursing up between this muscle and the pectoralis major, it pierces the sheath of the axillary vessels, and opens into the third portion of the axillary vein. It may communicate with the external jugular by means of a branch passing over the clavicle. The median basilic—the inner and usually the larger branch—is joined by the anterior (h) and posterior ulnar veins (g), either separately or conjointly, opposite the internal condyle ; it is then called the basilic vein, and, running up the inner side of the arm, pierces the fascia about the middle, joining the venae comites of the brachial to form the axillary vein. The anterior ulnar vein begins in radicals over the hypothenar eminence (the ball of the little finger), while the posterior begins in radicals upon the dorsal aspect of the fourth interosseous space, receiving the vein of the little finger (vena salvatella). The arrangement of these veins may be likened to an ornamental M, but this is not always well marked.

PLATE XIII. THE CIRCUMFLEX NERVE AND SCAPULAR QUADRILATERAL. In this dissection the attachment of the deltoid to the spine of the scapula has been cut through and the spine sawn across at its junction with the acromion process; the whole muscle and bone were then turned outwards, to expose the circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery. When viewed from the back, with the arm abducted from the side, the quadrilateral space or scapular quadrilateral is formed by the bone above, the long head of the triceps below, externally by the teres major, and the teres minor internally; but seen from the front, the teres minor is replaced by the axillary border of the subscapularis. Coming through the space are the posterior circumflex vessels and circumflex nerve. The branch of the circumflex artery marked (g) passes down to anastomose with one from the superior profunda, and it is this branch that usually enlarges and takes the place of the circumflex when, in abnormal conditions, that artery is not given off from the axillary, or vice versd. The circumflex nerve is a good illustration of Hiltonâ€™s law, that the main nerve to a joint not only supplies it, but also some of the muscles which act on the joint, as well as the skin over those muscles, thus securing during movement the true balance of force and friction. The fibres of origin of the infra-spinatus from the spine of the scapula overlap the upper portion of the origin from the infra-spinous fossa.

PLATE XLI, THE SIDE OF THE NECK WITH THE STERNO-MASTOID MUSCLE REMOVED. In this dissection, which is a deeper one on the same subject as plates 39 and 40, the sterno-mastoid muscle has been cut across its centre and the upper half turned up and left to show the course of the spinal accessory nerve, while the lower part with the inner half of the clavicle has been removed. Thus the two triangles have been thrown into one. The accompanying diagram has been intro- duced to show the structures covered by the sterno-mastoid muscle. They are: Muscles. — Sterno-hyoid and thyroid, scalenus an- ticus and medius, rectus capitis anticus major, splenius, levator anguli scapulas; digastric, omo - hyoid, edge of thyro-hyoid, inferior constrictor of the pharynx, deep cervical fascia. Vessels— Common, ex- ternal, internal carotids, superior thyroid and its sterno-mastoid branch, facial, lingual, occipital, posterior auricular, thy- roid axis and its branches, inferior thy- roid with the ascending Spinal accessory. 2. Small occipital. 3. Great auricular. 4. Super- 5 ficial cervical. 5. Supra-clavicular. 6, 7, 8. Cords of brachial cervical, transverse cer- plexus. 9. Twigs from ansa hypoglossi. 10. Hypoglossal, vical, supra - scapular ; The phrenic nerve has unfortunately been missed out in the diagram, internal jugular, facial and superior thyroid, middle thyroid, anterior jugular and external jugular veins. Nerves.—Hypoglossal, spinal accessory, descendens noni or cervicis, ansa hypoglossi and communicans noni; the roots of the cervical and brachial plexuses, phrenic and facial, small occipital, great auricular, superficial cervical, supra-clavicular nerves. Glands.—Parotid and deep lymphatic glands. Bones.—Mastoid process, transverse processes of the cervical vertebra?, sternum. Joint. - Sterno-clavicular.

PLATE XIX, SCARPA’S TRIANGLE. This plate shows a superficial dissection of the front of the thigh, the fascia lata and the sheath of the femoral vessels having been removed. If the line of Poupart’s ligament he compared with that in Plate XVIIL, it will be noticed that the ligament is bowed down towards the thigh when the fascia lata is intact; but when this is removed the line of the ligament becomes nearly straight, retracting sufficiently to allow the origin of the deep epigastric or circumflex iliac from the external iliac artery to be seen. Scarpa's Triangle.—This triangle is situated in the front of the thigh, with the base upwards and apex downwards. Its boundaries are:— Base: Poupart's ligament. Inside : Inner edge of the adductor longus. Outside: Inner edge of the sartorius. Floor is formed from within outwards by the adductor longus, pectineus, psoas, and iliacus muscles. Sometimes the adductor brevi3 is seen between the adductor longus and pectineus : this chiefly occurs in thin and weak subjects. Contents : It contains the common, superficial, and deep femoral arteries and veins and their branches; the anterior crural nerve with its branches; the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve and the external cutaneous nerve. The nerve to the sartorius is usually bound up with the middle cutaneous nerve, but it may occasionally run with the internal cutaneous. In the dissection represented the nerve came off direct from the anterior crural above Poupart’s ligament. The genito-crural nerve is not uncommonly united with the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural before piercing the fascia. (Macalister.)

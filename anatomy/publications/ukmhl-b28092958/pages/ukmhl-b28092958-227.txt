PLATE LIV. FIRST ANTERIOR VIEW OF THE THORAX. This plate shows the thorax, with the sternum, costal cartilages, and the anterior extremity of the ribs removed. Great care was taken not to open the pleural sacs and to preserve them in their normal position. The sternum and ribs were drawn first before removal, and the outline has been traced in white lines over the plate so as to show at a glance the relations of the various structures to the anterior wall of the thorax. The following diagram has been introduced to show the surface marking of the viscera. Note on the Pleura.â€”Luschka states that the inner edge of the left pleura diverges normally from the sternum opposite the upper border of the fifth cartilage and at the level of the sternal end of the fifth rib is about half an inch from the edge of the sternum, while at the level of the sternal end of the seventh rib it has receded nearly one and a half inches from the edge of the sternum. St. John Brooks, on the other hand, after a careful investigation, has shown that this is not the case, but that both pleura descend under the cover of the sternum as far as the seventh costal cartilage, and thus in some cases of paracentesis of the pericardium the pleura may be perforated, though in others probably the distension of the pericardium has pushed away the pleura from its loose attachment to the anterior walls.

PLATE LXXIII. SIDE VIEW OF THE FEMALE PELVIS. This plate was drawn from a dissection of the female pelvis after removal of the innominate bone. The left os innominatum was disarticulated from the sacrum and sawn through the body in front just internal to the obturator foramen; the spine of the ischium having been first removed to preserve the coccygeus muscle. The levator ani and coccygeus muscles were then turned down, and the recto-vesical fascia partly dissected away to expose the rectum and vagina. The accompanying diagram shows a posterior view of the uterus and broad ligaments ; on the left side the ovary is represented in its natural position, while on the right the ligament is stretched out to show the paroophoron (organ of Rosenmiiller). The following structures are contained between the layers of the broad ligament. 1. Fallopian tube. | 6. Remains of Gaertnerâ€™s duct. 2. Round ligament. 8. Ligament of ovary, 4. Ovary. 5. Paroophoron. 7. Uterine artery and veins. 8. Ovarian artery and veins. 9. Lymphatics. 10. Sympathetic nerves.

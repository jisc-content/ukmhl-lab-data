PLATE XVII, THE DORSUM OF THE HAND. This dissection shows the structures on the dorsum of the hand. In order to show more clearly the nerve-supply on the back of the hand and fingers, the following diagram has been introduced :—(e) dorsal branch of ulnar; (/) radial nerve; (g) twigs from the digital branches of the median supplying the dorsal aspect of the phalanges ; (h) twigs from the palmar digital branches of the ulnar which supply chiefly the lateral aspects of the little and half the ring finger. Those twigs on the ulnar side of the little finger could not be shown for want of space. The six different compartments of the posterior annular ligament are, starting from the radial side :— I. For the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis. II.- For the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. III. For the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. IV. For the extensor communis digitorum and extensor indicia. Y. For the extensor minimi digiti. YI. For the extensor carpi ulnaris. The synovial sheath of the extensor secundi communicates with that of the extensores carpi radiales as they cross each other.

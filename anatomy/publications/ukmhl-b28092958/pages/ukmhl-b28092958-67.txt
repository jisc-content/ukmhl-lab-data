PLATE XIV. THE BACK OF THE ARM AND MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE. This plate shows a dissection to expose the musculo-spiral nerve as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove. The long and external heads of the triceps have been detached from the common tendon below, and turned outwards; the fascial expansion, which comes off from the lower and external part of the triceps, and covers the anconeus, has been partly reflected to expose that muscle. The nerve to the anconeus has been traced through the fibres of the internal head of the triceps. The cutaneous nerve-supply of the back of the arm is shown in the adjoining diagram:—(a) Acromial branches of cervical nerves; (b) cutaneous branches from circumflex; (c) upper, and (d) lower external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral; (e) internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral; (/) intercosto- liumeral; (g) nerve of Wrisberg; (h) posterior branch of the internal cutaneous. The close proximity of the musculo-spiral nerve to the bone, as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove, should be noted, as it is thus rendered liable to pressure- injuries: e.g. pressure of a badly-made crutch may produce paralysis, the so-called ‘ crutch-palsy.’ During the dissection of this region, do not forget to examine the course of the ulnar nerve behind the internal condyle, which it grooves, lying against the internal lateral ligament before it passes into the forearm between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Whilst in the groove it is covered by a band of fibrous tissue which passes across from the back of the condyle to the olecranon : this is the degenerate remains of a muscle, the epitrochleo-anconeus, which exists pretty constantly in the lower mammals, including a few of the primates, but is not seen in the anthropoid apes. It is also important to remember the relation of the ulnar nerve to the joint in excising the elbow, lest it should be damaged during the operation.

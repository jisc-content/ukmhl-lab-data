56 PLATE XXVITl. MUSCLES A Gluteus medius. B Gluteus minimus. C Pyriformis. D Obturator internus.1 11 E Gemellus inferior. F Quadratus femoris. G Adductor magnus. H Gluteus maximus. I Vastus externus. K Great sacro-sciatic ligament cut and turned down. L Biceps and semitendinosus, origin from tuber ischii. *M Lesser sacro-sciatic ligament and coccygeus. N Spine of ischium. 0 Levator ani. P External sphincter. R Vertebral aponeurosis. S Tendon of obturator externus. V Placed over the sacro coccygeal joint. W Section of sacrum. X Section of ilium. Y Tuber ischii. Z Great trochanter. VESSELS a Gluteal artery. b Superficial division of the gluteal. c Deep division of the gluteal. d Sciatic artery. e Internal pudic. / Anastomotic branch of internal circum- flex to the digital fossa. NERVES 1 Lumbo-sacral cord. 2 First sacral. 3 Second sacral. 4 Third sacral. 5 Fourth sacral. 6 Fifth sacral. 7 Coccygeal. 8 Superior gluteal. 9 Branch from second to pyriformis. 10 Inferior gluteal. 11 Great sciatic. 12 Small sciatic. 18 Inferior pudendal. 14 Recurrent gluteal branches of small sciatic. 15 Nerve to quadratus femoris, inferior gemellus, and hip-joint. 16 Nerve to obturator internus and superior gemellus. 17 Internal pudic. 18 Perforating cutaneous nerve (n. per- forans cutaneus). 191 Visceral branches of third and fourth 20 J sacral. 21 Nerve to coccygeus. 22 Nerve to sphincter. 23 Nerve to levator ani. 24 Nerve formed by the junction of fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal, dis- tributed to skin (ano-caudal). In some cases it will be found that the small sacro-sciatic ligament is entirely or partly replaced by fibres of the coccygeus muscle, of which it appears to be a fibrous retrogression ; in the armadillo this is again replaced by bone. 1 The muscle substance was very thin in this body, and there was complete absence of the gemellus superior.

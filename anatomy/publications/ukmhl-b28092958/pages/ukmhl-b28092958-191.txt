PLATE XLY. SECOND VIEW OF THE PTERYGOID REGION, TEMPORAL MUSCLE, AND PART OF RAMUS OF JAW REMOVED. This plate shows a deeper dissection of the same subject as the previous drawing. The coronoid process has been cut through at its base and turned upwards with the temporal muscle, and the ramus of the jaw sawn through just below the pterygoid fossa and above the inferior dental foramen and removed, exposing the first and second portions of the internal maxillary artery. The first portion of the artery passes between the ramus of the jaw and the so-oalled long internal lateral ligament; it is generally described as giving off four branches, but . it is much more usual to find only two, viz., the inferior dental and middle meningeal, the latter giving the tympanic and small middle meningeal. All these four arteries pass through bony foramina. The second portion of the artery varies in its course, being sometimes superficial and sometimes deep to the external pterygoid muscle, the proportion given on the conjoint investigation of the Anatomical Committee being 54 per cent, above, and 44 per cent, below; this portion of the artery gives off four sets of muscular branchesâ€”buccal, pterygoids, temporal, and masseteric, and one arterial comes to the lingual nerve. The third portion of the artery lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and gives six branches which all pass through bony foramina alveolar, infra-orbital, posterior pharyngeal, Vidian, posterior palatine, naso-palatine. The long internal lateral or spheno-mandibular ligament is a thin loose band of fibrous tissue which stretches across from the spinous process of the sphenoid to the inner edge of the inferior dental foramen. It is too lax to be of much use as a ligament, and is really the fibrous remains of a part of the Meckelian bar of cartilage.

PLATE LI. Natural Size. THE PHARYNX OPENED SHOWING PALATE, POSTERIOR NARES, &c. In this dissection the constrictor muscles were divided along the median raphe and the pharyngeal aponeurosis partly detached from its upper attachment; the mucous membrane was carefully removed from the soft palate and pharynx. On the left side the posterior layer of the palato-pharyngeus was partially turned back, while on the right it was completely removed. The right levator palati was also divided, and the pharyngeal aponeurosis removed from the border of the pterygoid process, in order to expose the tensor palati. The position of the tensor and levator palati muscles should he carefully studied, as they have to be divided in operations for cleft palate, because they are concerned in drawing apart the edges of the cleft; thus causing tension on the stitches when the edges are sutured together. The enervation of the levator palati has given rise to much discussion, but Horsley and Beevor have discovered that stimulation of the facial within the skull produces no effect on the palate, while as soon as the eleventh nerve was stimulated, that side of.the soft palate was at once raised. The nerve supply probably reaches it through the pharyngeal plexus. In the early foetus the anterior pillar of the fauces is a sharp fold bounding a deep recess which was the lower part of the second post-oral cleft; the tonsil is a mass of adenoid tissue developed in the cleft, and above it there is often a fossaâ€”the supra- tonsillar fossa which is a permanent remains of the cleft. The posterior pillars of the fauces are developed later, and divide this pouch into the supra-tonsillar fossa and the lateral recess of the pharynx.

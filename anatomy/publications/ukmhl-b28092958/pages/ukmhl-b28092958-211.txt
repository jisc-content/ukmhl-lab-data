PLATE L. Natural Size. THE PHARYNX FROM BEHIND. In this dissection the anterior portion of the skull was detached from the posterior by means of two saw cuts, beginning behind the mastoid process and running parallel with the petrous portion of the temporal bone and passing through the posterior wall of the jugular foramen. The basilar process of the occipital bone was then broken through by a chisel cut and the anterior portion of the skull removed. On the right side the various structures passing up to and from the base of the skull were left in their normal positions, while on the left the internal carotid, internal jugular vein and sympathetic nerves were cut away to show the structures in front of them. The vagus and spinal accessory were cut and hooked aside and the digastric partly cut away. A diagram has been introduced here to show the connections of the nerves with each other and the sympathetic as they leave the skull, the hypoglossal having been omitted for the sake of clearness. The distribution of the nerve of Jacobson is also indicated in a diagrammatic manner.

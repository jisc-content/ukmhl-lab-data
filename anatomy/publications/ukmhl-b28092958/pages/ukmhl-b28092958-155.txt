PLATE XXXVI. THE THIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES IN THE SOLE. In this dissection the long flexor tendons have been cut, and the flexor accessorius divided in order to expose more fully the next layer of muscles, which comprises— 1. The flexor brevis hallucis. 2. The adductor hallucis. < 3. The transversus pedis. 4. The flexor brevis minimi digiti. In a note on the short muscles of the thumb a table has been introduced showing a comparison of the short muscles of the hallux and pollex ; the flexor brevis hallucis comparing with the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis, the abductor with the abductor, the adductor hallucis (or oblique adductor) with the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the transversus pedis (the transverse adductor) with the adductor pollicis. There is no opponens hallucis in the foot, and in the hand the opponens is but a segmentation from the flexor brevis pollicis. A useful comparison may also be instituted between the nerve supply of the hand and foot, the external plantar resembling the ulnar, while the internal resembles the median :— Hand. Foot. (Three and a half fingers, abductor pollicis. flexor brevis pollicis (outer head), opponens pollicis. lumbricales, two. (One and a half fingers, all other muscles in palm not supplied by median.

Plantar 1°^er muscles m sole n°t ( supplied by internal plantar. The course of the deep plantar arch may be traced by drawing a line from the mid- point between the os calcis and malleolus, across the foot to the fourth interosseous space opposite the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal, and then across the sole to the first inter- osseous space. This arch corresponds to the deep palmar arch in the hand, and the communicating artery from the dorsalis pedis will be analogous to the radial.

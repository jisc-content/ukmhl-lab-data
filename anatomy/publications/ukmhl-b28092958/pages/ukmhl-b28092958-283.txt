PLATE LXIX. POSTERIOR WALL OF ABDOMEN-KIDNEYS AND SPLEEN. This plate is taken from the same body as the preceding. The pancreas, ascending and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and the liver, excepting a small portion sur- rounding the vena cava, have been removed. Thus the kidneys, almost the entire length of the vena cava, and most of the branches of the abdominal aorta have been exposed. The following diagram shows the anterior relations of the kidneys, but it should be borne in mind that these necessarily alter somewhat with each individual, according to the height of the kidney above the iliac crest, and therefore can only be taken as a mean. The height of the lower edge of the kidneys above the iliac crest varies very con- sideiably, but on the whole the left is usually placed a little higher than the right. As the suprarenal bodies are not usually well seen in the dissecting-room, the accompanying diagrams taken from Dr. Rollestonâ€™s paper1 illustrate their general form and relations. 1 Journal of Anat. and Phys. voi. xxvi. p. 548.

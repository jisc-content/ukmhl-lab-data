PLATE LXVII. THE THIRD VIEW OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. In this plate the transverse colon has been cut away between the hepatic and splenic flexures. The stomach has been drawn forward to the thoracic wall, exposing its posterior surface. The small intestine has been removed with the mesentery, which has been cut short, and its anterior layer removed to expose the remains of the superior mesenteric vessels. Part of the posterior wall of the abdomen has been denuded of peritoneum, to expose the aorta and inferior mesenteric vessels. The posterior layer of the lesser sac has also been reflected off the posterior wall of the abdomen to expose more of the body of the pancreas. The accompanying diagrams were copied from Professor Cunningham’s paper 1 on the abdomen, to illustrate the varying relations of the duodenum and kidney due to the alteration in height of the latter. 1 On reference to Professor Cunningham’s Manual of Practical Anatomy 1 find'the diagrams were drawn by Dr. St. John Brooks.

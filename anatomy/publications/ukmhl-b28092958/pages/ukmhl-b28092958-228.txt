I Mr. Tredgold draws the following conclusions from a close investigation of the ribs of ten genera of primates : (1) that there is a gradual but marked reduction in the total number as we rise in the scale ; (2) that there is a coincident and proportionate reduction in the number of the sternal ribs, and (3) that the 8th rib tends to change from a sternal to a costal one, and consequently (4) the thoracic cavity is shortened, but the capacity is compensated by an increase in breadth.1 1 Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxx. p. 289.

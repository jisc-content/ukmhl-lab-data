PLATE XXVI. THE BUTTOCK, GLUTEUS MEDIUS, &c. In this dissection the gluteus maximus has been cut across its middle and the ends turned up and down, and the fibres arising from the great sacro-sciatic ligament have been partly detached in order to show more clearly the edge of the ligament. The parts which are exposed by complete removal of the gluteus maximus are— Bones.—Ilium, edge of sacrum and coccyx, tuber ischii, great trochanter, and gluteal ridge on the femur. Ligaments.—Great and lesser sacro-sciatic. Bursce.—One over tuber ischii, one over great trochanter, and one between the tendon of the vastus externus and that part of the gluteus maximus which is inserted into the fascia lata. Muscles.—Gluteus medius, pyriformis, obturator internus and the gemelli, tendon of the obturator externus, quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, biceps, semi- tendinosus, semimembranosus, vastus externus. Vessels.—Gluteal, sciatic, with its coccygeal, muscular, anastomotic, comes nervi ischiadici, and terminal branches, pudic, internal circumflex, and first perforating. Nerves.—Great and small sciatics, inferior gluteal, inferior pudendal, internal pudic, and the nerve to the obturator internus.

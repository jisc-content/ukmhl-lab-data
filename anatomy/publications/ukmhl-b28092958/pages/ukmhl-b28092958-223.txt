PLATE LIII. SAGITTAL SECTION OF THE HEAD. The so-called fourth meatus of the nose, i.e. the space between the upper turbinal bone and the roof of the nose, was very shallow, and is chiefly hidden by the projecting part of the anterior surface of the body of the sphenoid. The lateral recesses of the pharynx, I, are the remains of the dorsal end of the second post-oral visceral pouches which never perforate in the normal human embryo. The dissection illustrated in this plate is one which Mr. Sutton made without freezing for the Middlesex Hospital Museum; several were cut before as good a one as this resulted. (I intended to have made an original dissection, but there was no possibility of obtaining fresh enough material; nor even sufficiently fresh to make a dissection for the topography of the brain.)

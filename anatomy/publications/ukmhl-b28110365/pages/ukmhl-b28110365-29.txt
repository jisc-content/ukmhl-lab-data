NEURAL CANAL 25 layers of the blastocyst are fused, and some think that the mesoblast arises from cells budded off from the ectoblastic cells of the primitive streak in this situation. When speaking of gastrulation, it was intimated that this process in higher mammals is atypical. There appears early in the human embryo a fissure at the head-end of the primitive streak. Soon converted into a canal, it opens into the vitelline sac. It is termed the neurenteric canal, and is merely a temporary structure, its remains being represented in the adult by the anal dimple. Its opening is probably homologous with a blastopore, and Hertwig and others be- lieve the primitive streak itself represents an elongated blastopore, the lips of which are fused. Fundamental Embryological Processes. While the primitive streak was but temporary, though sufficing to indicate the future axis of the embryo, the first manifestation of permanent structures is presented by forma- tion of the neural canal, the notochord, and the mesoblastic somites. Neural Canal. A median longitudinal groove appears on the surface of the embryo toward its head-end and in front of the primi- tive streak. This is the medullary groove. The groove is produced by thickening of ectoblastic cells on each side of the axis, resulting in longitudinal ridges, the medullary folds. The folds, directed dorsally, meet anteriorly and diverge be- hind, where they enclose the anterior end of the primitive streak. The medullary folds increase in height, incline to- ward one another until they come into contact, and fuse from before backward, so that the medullary groove is converted into the neural canal. In fusing posteriorly, they incorporate the cells of the primitive streak, thus effacing the latter as a separate structure. The neural canal soon becomes sep- arated from the surface-ectoblast. The neural canal gives rise to all the fundamental parts of the nervous system, including its supporting tissue and

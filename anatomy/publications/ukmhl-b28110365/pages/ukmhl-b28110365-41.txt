THE HUMAN PLACENTA 37 The Deciduae. The term decidua means, literally, a falling off. The endometrium, when modified by pregnancy as described above, becomes the decidua because, with the exception of the glands spared in the deeper parts of the spongy layer, it is shed with the after-birth. The decidua specializes into three parts, namely the decidua capsularis, the decidua placentalis, and the decidua vera. The decidua capsularis forms at the site of the blood clot which is present after the embryonic vesicle has embedded itself. It therefore overlies the latter and juts out into the uterine cavity. As the contents of the pregnant uterus in- crease the decidua capsularis is greatly expanded, is pushed against the decidua vera, and finally is wholly absorbed. The chorion leve, therefore, is now in contact with the de- cidua vera. The decidua placentalis is that part of the decidua upon which the embryonic vesicle lies, and from which the pla- centa is subsequently formed. It is therefore the most im- portant of the three deciduae. It is situated between the blastocyst and the uterine wall. It is characterized by the presence of giant cells which appear towards the latter part of pregnancy and tend to gather about the blood-vessels. It is in the decidua placentalis that the chorion frondosum undergoes its complete development, as described above. The decidua vera constitutes the remainder of the de- cidua, or that part which lines the uterus outside the site of the embedded embryonic vesicle. It is best developed near the latter and least developed near the cervix. It later thins out greatly, as^ described above. The Human Placenta. The human placenta represents the highest specializa- tion of an apparatus for bringing the fetal blood into inti- mate relation with the blood of the mother, and is the organ of nutrition and of respiration for the fetus during about the latter two-thirds of the period of gestation. It is formed

11 MITOSIS in combination with albuminates). Chromatin is of the utmost importance, both because of the active part it as- sumes in indirect cell-division, and because it is the material basis of the hereditary qualities passed down from one gen- eration to another. The nuclear matrix (nuclear juice) is semifluid, and probably of the same nature as hyaloplasm. It contains paralinin. The nucleolus is a small, spherical body that rests among the nuclear fibers. It contains a substance called pyrenin. Its function has not been definitely established. The centrosome is a small body situated in the cyto- plasm near the nuclear membrane, often embedded in a little sphere of centroplasm. It may be surrounded by a halo, the centrosphere. It is the dynamic center of the cell. Cell-Division. There are two methods by which cells divideâ€”mitotic (indirect) and amitotic (direct). In amitotic division the cell elongates and the nucleus divides so that two nuclei are formed. The entire cell then undergoes constriction in its middle and contracts more and more around the nuclei as they recede from each other, and finally separates into two new cells, each of which contains a nucleus. This pro- cess is usually confined to cells whose vitality has been im- paired. Mitotic division, on the other hand, is almost the universal rule. Mitosis. Mitosis (indirect cell-division) is the cycle of changes a cell undergoes to reproduce two new cells of its kind. Fur- thermore, through this complicated mechanism is assured equal division of the chromatin of the parent cell, so that each daughter-cell gets exactly one-half the original amount, and also the maintenance of the quota of chromosomes nor- mal to the species. The number of chromosomes for each cell of a given species is constant. In the human being every somatic cell contains 24 chromosomes. In mitosis, each chromosome

15 MATURATION OF OVUM distinct cell-wall, the vitelline membrane. This encloses the vitellus (yolk), which consists of ooplasm (vice cyto- plasm), and of nutritive granules, the deutoplasm. The germinal vesicle (nucleus) is enclosed within a nuclear membrane, and the germinal spot (nucleolus) lies within it. The centrosome occupies its usual position just without the nuclear membrane, but is not always visible. Classification of Ova. Ova are classified according to the amount and distribu- tion of the deutoplasm thus:â€” (1) Homolecithal, in which the deutoplasm is meager in amount and uniformly distributed throughout the vitel- lus. Such is the mammalian ovum. (2) Telolecithal, in which the ooplasm is accumulated at one pole and the deutoplasm at the other. The ooplasm is the formative yolk and occupies the animal pole, while the deutoplasm is the nutritive yolk and occupies the vege- tative pole. Such are the eggs of Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, and Amphibians. (3) Centrolecithal, in which the ooplasm is confined to the periphery and the deutoplasm to the center. Such are the eggs of some Insects. Maturation of Ovum. Maturation signifies the changes that prepare the ovum for fertilization. Before it can functionate, every immature ovum must undergo this process. It will be seen that the ob- ject of maturation is to reduce the number of chromosomes by one-half, so that the matured ovum contains one-half the number of chromosomes a somatic cell possesses. The same result is accomplished in spermatogenesis, the spermatic filament having half as many chromosomes as its ancestor, the spermatogone. It is understood, of course, that the primordial sexual cells and the somatic cells have an equal number of chromosomes. This number is constant in every species, and in man is now regarded as twenty-four. If, then,

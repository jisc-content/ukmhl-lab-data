47 VARIETIES OF EPITHELIUM Varieties of Epithelium. (1) Squamous. a. Simple squamous. b. Stratified squamous. (2) Columnar. a. Simple columnar. b. Stratified columnar. (3) Modified. a. Ciliated. b. Goblet. c. Pigmented. (4) Specialized. a. Glandular epithelium. b. Neuro-epithelium. Simple squamous epithelium consists of flattened cells united edge to edge and forming a single layer. This defini- tion applies equally well to a brick sidewalk, a fact recog- nized by the appellation “pavement epithelium.” It is found in the alveoli of the lungs, and lines the anterior part of the lens capsule, and parts of the membranous labyrinth of the ear. It also occurs in the kidney and brain. Stratified squamous epithelium is found on free surfaces that are exposed to vertical pressure, such as the skin and various mucous membranes, and hence is essentially con- cerned in protection. It is thick in places, as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and often contains tactile nerve elements, as in the fingers and lips. The deepest cells are perpendicular to the surface, and the upper cells gradu- ally alter their shape until the most superficial are flat and parallel with the surface. The deeper the cells the younger they are, and when the youngest are dissociated, their points of previous union resemble minute spines, so that they are termed “prickle-cells.” The oldest (most superficial) cells are ever being shed by mechanical brushings-off, as well as by vis-a-tergo of the newly-formed cells. This process is appropriately called “desquamation.” This variety is con- spicuous in the skin and its extensions, in the mouth, esopha- gus, most of the urinary tract, and elsewhere.

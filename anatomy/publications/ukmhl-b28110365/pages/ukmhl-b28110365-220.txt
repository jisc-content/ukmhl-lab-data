216 THE BONES (3) Epiotic (upon the ear), which forms the lower part of the mastoid portion. The mastoid process begins to de- velop in the second year, and its pneumatic cells form dur- ing the growth of the child. (4) Pterotic (wing of ear), which forms the tegmen tympani and covers in the external semicircular canal. These four parts join each other before birth, and the squamous in the first year. The styloid process is ossified from two centers that appear in the dorsal end of the cartilage of the second vis- ceral arch. Its base appears before birth and rapidly joins the petrous portion, being encircled by the vaginal process. This part is the tympanohyal of comparative anatomy. The rest of the styloid process ossifies from a center that appears at, or after, birth. This part is the stylohyal of comparative anatomy. The tympanohyal and stylohyal usually anky- lose later in life. Sometimes the stylohyoid ligament un- dergoes ossification, producing in such cases the epihyal bone of comparative anatomy, this ligament being naturally osseous in many animals. In some colored races and in nearly all Monkeys the temporal bone articulates with the frontal. In Caucasians and the Howling Monkey this articulation seldom exists. Sphenoid Bone. The sphenoid (wedge-like) lies athwart the base of the skull, just in front of its middle, and is wedged in between all the other bones of the cranium. Comparing it to a bat with extended wings, it presents a body, greater wings, les- ser wings, and pterygoid processes (legs of bat). The body, cuboidal and hollow, presents six surfaces. The superior shows:—• (1) Ethmoidal spine before, which articulates with the horizontal plate of the ethmoid. (2) Longitudinal eminence, in mid-line. (3) Longitudinal depression, on each side of latter, for olfactory tract. (4) Transverse ridge, the anterior border of the (5) Optic groove, situated before and below the optic commissure.

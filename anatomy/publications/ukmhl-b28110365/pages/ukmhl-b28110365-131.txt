127 PROSTATE GLAND Vas Deferens. The vas deferens, which connects the globus minor with the ejaculatory duct, presents three coats—mucous, muscu- lar, and fibrous. The mucous coat is lined by stratified ciliated columnar epithelium in the first part of the vas, where it continues that of the epididymis, and by stratified non-ciliated col- umnar in the remainder of its course. The basement mem- brane is well-defined, and the tunica propria consists, as elsewhere, of fibro-elastic tissue. The muscular coat consists of non-striated bundles ar- ranged in three layers—outer longitudinal layer, middle cir- cular layer, and inner longitudinal layer. These three coats are exceptionally well developed, and impart to the vas the cord-like character by which it is distinguished from the other constituents of the spermatic cord. The fibrous coat envelops the muscular and blends with surrounding tissues. Seminal Vesicles. Each seminal vesicle consists of a labyrinthine tube that presents three coats—mucous, muscular, and fibrous. The mucous coat is lined by simple columnar non-cili- ated epithelium which forms diverticula containing goblet- cells. The muscular coat is composed of non-striated bundles arranged in an outer longitudinal layer, and an inner circu- lar layer. This coat is well-developed. The fibrous coat forms a capsule for the seminal vesicle. Prostate Gland. The prostate gland belongs to the tubulo-alveolar va- riety. It is composed of two and, according to the view- point, three lobes, which are made up of lobules. The lob- ules consist of groups of alveoli. The alveoli and their ducts are lined by simple columnar non-ciliated epithelium, whose

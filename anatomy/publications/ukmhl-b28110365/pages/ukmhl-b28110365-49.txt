45 DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACE The third and fourth pharyngeal pouches give origin to the thymus and thyroid bodies, respectively. The latter body originates in part, also, from the entoblast near the sec- ond visceral arch. The parathyroids arise from both pouches. Development of the Face. The mandibular processes of the first visceral arch, as mentioned above, unite to form the lower jaw. The fronto- nasal process, descending from above, shows on each side an olfactory pit. It then soon divides on each side into two nasal processes, a mesial, and a lateral. The former bounds the olfactory pit internally, and the latter bounds it exter- nally. The maxillary arches of the two sides unite anteriorly with the fronto-nasal process, and thus is formed the upper boundary of the mouth. The mesial nasal processes form the septum nasi, the philtrum of the upper lip, and the in- termaxillary part of the superior maxilla. The olfactory pits become the anterior nares, and the lateral nasal proc- esses form the alae of the nose. Arrested development of these processes, such as may be caused by the interposition of a fold of amnion, results in deformities like hare-lip and cleft palate.

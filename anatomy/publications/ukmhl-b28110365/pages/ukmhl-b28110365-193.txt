PHALANGES 189 the first to the fifth in the Great Ant-eater and the Ornitho- rhynchus. In the Land Tortoise and Ichthyosaurus they are extremely short and stunted. Phalanges. The phalanges, or toe-bones, number fourteen, of which three are distributed to each toe and two to the hallux. They are disposed in three rows, a posterior, a middle, and an anterior. A posterior phalanx is constricted in the middle and ex- panded at the extremities. The shaft, compressed laterally, is convex above and concave below. The base presents an oval, concave facet for the head of the corresponding meta- tarsal. The head shows a trochlear surface for the second phalanx. The posterior phalanx of the great toe receives the ten- dons of the flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis, adductor hallucis transversus and obliquus, and extensor digitorum brevis; that of the second, the first and second dorsal inter- ossei; that of the third, the third dorsal and first plantar in- terossei; that of the fourth, the second plantar and fourth dorsal interossei; and that of the fifth, the third plantar in- terosseous, the flexor brevis digiti minimi, and the abductor digiti minimi. A middle phalanx is stunted, short and insignificant. Its base shows a double concavity separated by a vertical ridge for the trochlear facet on the head of the posterior phalanx. The head presents a trochlear surface for the an- terior phalanx. The middle phalanx of the fifth toe is fre- quently fused with the anterior. The middle phalanges receive, dorsally, expansions from the tendons of the extensor digitorum longus, extensor digi- torum brevis (except the fifth toe), and interossei and lum- biicals. The terminal phalanx of the hallux receives expan- sions from the tendons of the flexor and extensor hallucis longus. An anterior phalanx is comparatively small and flat- tened from above downward. The base is broad, and pre- sents a facet for the head of the middle phalanx. The shaft

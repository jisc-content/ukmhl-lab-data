Behind, the internal surface presents, be- fore, the auricular (ear-like) surface for articulation with the sacrum, and behind and above this a rough surface, the tuberosity of the ilium, for the posterior sacroiliac and ilio- lumbar ligaments, and for partial origin of the erector and multifidus spinae. Of the three borders, the superior, or crest, begins be- fore at the anterior superior spine and, after having de- scribed a shallow “s,” ends behind at the posterior superior spine. It is divided into an external lip, to which are at- tached the external oblique, latissimus dorsi, and tensor fasciae latae, and the fascia lata; an interspace for the in- ternal oblique; and the internal lip for the transversalis, quadratus lumborum, erector spinae and the iliac fascia. The anterior border, sinuous in profile, extends from the an- terior superior spine to the upper margin of the acetabulum. The anterior superior spine, corresponding to the junction between the superior and anterior borders, gives attachment to Poupart’s ligament, and origin to the sartorius and tensor fasciae latae. Just below this spine is the superior iliac notch, from which part of the sartorius arises; below this notch is the anterior inferior spine, for partial origin (straight head) of the rectus femoris, and for the iliofemoral ligament; and between the lower spine and the margin of the acetabulum is the inferior iliac notch. The posterior border begins at the posterior superior spine, which corre- sponds to the junction between the superior and posterior borders as well as to the posterior limit of the tuberosity of the ilium; it then forms a concavity, the posterior iliac notch; then a prominence, the posterior inferior spine, which corre- sponds to the hinder end of the auricular surface; and finally terminates by forming the upper limit of the great sciatic notch. The ischium forms the posterior and inferior part of the os innominatum, and consists of a body, thick and solid; a tuberosity, large and rough, which supports the trunk in the sitting posture; and a ramus, a laterally-compressed bar of bone that extends forward and upward at an acute angle from the tuberosity.

DEVELOPMENT 44 visceral arches consist of thickened masses of mesoblastic tissue covered externally by ectoblast, and internally by en- toblast. Cross-section of the visceral arches shows that the grooves between them do not become distinct clefts, this be- ing prevented by the ectoblast externally and the entoblast internally. Each arch supports a blood-vessel, the aortic bow, of which, therefore, there are five pairs. The ultimate fate of these will be considered in the chapter dealing with the blood-vessels. Fate of the Visceral Arches. The first or mandibular arch divides into two processes, the maxillary above, and the mandibular below. The maxil- lary processes unite with each other and with the fronto- nasal process to form the upper jaw, while the mandibular processes join to form the lower jaw. Part of the cartilage of this arch forms the incus and the malleus, and the re- mainder, known as Meckel's cartilage, disappears later. The second or hyoid arch contains cartilage which forms the crura of the stapes, the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid ligament, and the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. That part of the cartilage from which the last-named structure de- velops is known as Reichert's cartilage. The third arch, by means of its cartilage, forms the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone. The fourth and fifth arches disappear. Fate of the Visceral Furrows and Pharyngeal Pouches. The first visceral furrow, or hyomandibular cleft, gives rise to the external auditory meatus. The second, third, and fourth visceral furrows disap- pear. The first pharyngeal pouch forms the Eustachian tube and middle ear, and the layer of mesoblast that separates it from the first visceral furrow forms the membrana tympani. The second pharyngeal pouch, perhaps, determines the site of the fossa of Rosenmuller.

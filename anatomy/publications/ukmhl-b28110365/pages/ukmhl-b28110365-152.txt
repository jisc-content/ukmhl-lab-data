THE BONES 148 process below, which articulates with the trochlea and is divided by a longitudinal ridge that passes from the apex of the olecranon process to that of the coronoid into a larger internal portion and a smaller external, while its sharp mar- gin receives the joint-capsule. It also shows the lesser sig- moid cavity, which corresponds to the external surface of the coronoid process, receives the circumference of the head of the radius, the orbicular ligament by its anterior and pos- terior margins, and is confluent with the greater sigmoid cavity, though separated from it by a low ridge. The shaft, thick above and tapering below, presents three borders and as many surfaces. Of the three borders, the anterior, mostly smooth and rounded, begins at the inner edge of the anterior surface of the coronoid process, gives origin to the flexor digitorum profundus in its middle two-fourths and to the pronator quadratus in its lowest fourth, terminates in front of the styloid process, and separates the anterior from the internal surface; the posterior, subcutaneous, begins at the apex of the posterior surface of the olecranon process, receives in its upper three-fourths the common aponeurosis of the flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum pro- fundus, is smooth and rounded in its lower fourth, terminates behind the styloid process, and separates the internal from the posterior surface; and the external (interosseous), sharp and prominent above and smooth and rounded below, begins by the union of two ridges that converge from the extremi- ties of the lesser sigmoid cavity and enclose the triangular bicipital fossa which lodges the tuberosity of the radius and the insertion of the biceps tendon during pronation before, and behind gives origin to the supinator, affords attachment in its lower four-fifths to the interosseous membrane, termin- ates at the middle of the head of the ulna, and separates the anterior from the posterior surface. Of the three surfaces, the anterior is broad and grooved in its upper three-fourths for origin of the flexor digitorum profundus, shows the nutrient foramen near the junction of its upper and middle thirds, and is narrow and convex below for origin of the pronator quadratusâ€”the upper limit of which area sometimes shows the pronator ridge; the intern- al, broad and concave above and narrow and convex below,

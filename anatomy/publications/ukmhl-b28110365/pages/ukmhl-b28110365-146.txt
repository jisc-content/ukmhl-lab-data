THE BONES 142 ous with the lower lip of the dorsal border of the spine; and its internal border is concave and continuous with the upper lip of the dorsal border of the spine, and shows internally an area to which part of the trapezius is attached, then an oval facet which meets that on the acromial end of the clavicle,, and externally a tip where both borders meet, and to which is attached the coracoacromial ligament. Of the three borders, the superior is the shortest and thinnest, and runs from the superior angle to the base of the coracoid, where it is interrupted by the suprascapular notch, which is converted into a foramen by a ligament (sometimes ossified) of the same name, and is traversed by the suprascapular nerve; close to the notch arises the pos- terior belly of the omohyoid; the axillary is the thickest, runs from the lower margin of the glenoid cavity to the in- ferior angle, and presents above an inch-long rough area for the long head of the triceps, then a groove for the dorsal ar- tery, and ventrally a longitudinal groove for the subscapular- is; the vertebral is the longest, extends from the superior to the inferior angle, and affords attachment above the triangu- lar area, at which the spine commences, to the levator scap- ulae, at the border of the triangular area to the rhomboideus minor, and below to the fibrous arch, into which the rhom- boideus major inserts. Of the three angles, the superior is thin, indicates the meeting of the superior and vertebral borders, and gives par- tial origin to the levator scapulae; the inferior, thick and rough, indicates the meeting of the vertebral and axillary borders, and gives partial origin externally to the teres major and sometimes to the latissimus dorsi; and the exter- nal is the thickest part of the bone and corresponds to the head, which supports the glenoid surface and the coracoid. The glenoid surface is concave and pyriform, with the narrow end above. To its margin, which is more prominent below and in front, is attached the glenoid ligament, which, in the recent state, deepens the concavity of the glenoid sur- face for articulation with the head of the humerus. At the upper end of the glenoid surface is the supraglenoid tubercle for the long head of the biceps, and below the margin is con- tinuous with the infraglenoid tubercle at the upper part of the axillary border for the long head of the triceps.

26 DEVELOPMENT the peripheral nerves. While the canal is yet open behind, there appear at its closed cephalic end three bulgings, the primary cerebral vesicles, from which develop the fore-brain, the mid-brain, and the hind-brain, respectively. The first cerebral vesicle gives rise to a dilatation, the optic vesicle, which is the anlage of the retina. The neural crest develops from cells at the line of fusion of the medullary folds, and gives origin to the dorsal spinal ganglia. Notochord. The notochord (back-cord) is a cylindrical rod of ento- blastic cells lying in the axis of the embryo subjacent to the neural canal. It is formed while the medullary groove is still open. The entoblast underlying this groove thickens into a plate which soon becomes curved, the concavity be- ing on its under surface. The curve increases so that the edges of the plate approach one another and fuse. This results in a tube, but the lumen is soon obliterated by en- largement of its bounding cells. With the fusion of the edges, the general entoblastic layer is brought together and again forms an unbroken sheet immediately subjacent to the notochord. The anterior end of the notochord corresponds to the future site of the body of the sphenoid bone. From here it extends the whole length of the embryo, terminating at the future site of the tip of the coccyx. Hence, it may readily be concluded that the notochord is a form upon which the spinal column is moulded. When this is accomplished, the notochord disappears, traces of it remaining in the center of each intervertebral disk only. While but transient in higher animals, in the amphioxus the notochord is permanent and is the only axial skeleton it possesses. In Fishes, the axial skeleton never gets beyond the cartilaginous stage, but in higher animals it reaches the bony stage. Since the notochord falls short of the neural canal an- teriorly, the overextension of the latter is distinguished as the prechordal portion.

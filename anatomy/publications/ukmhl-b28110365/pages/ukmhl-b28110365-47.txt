43 THE VISCERAL ARCHES AND FURROWS At birth the child measures about 20 inches from vertex to heels, and weighs about 7 pounds. Development of the Limbs. The limbs develop from little bud-like processes that spring from two lateral longitudinal ridges, situated one on each side of the body. They appear about the twenty-second day. During the fifth week each limb-bud is divided into three segments, of which the proximal becomes the arm or thigh, the middle the forearm or leg, and the distal the hand or foot. The digits are marked out by four longitudinal par- allel grooves on the distal segment of each limb-bud. By conversion of these grooves into clefts the fingers and. toes begin to separate in the sixth week, and are well-formed in the seventh. The fingers are formed somewhat sooner than the toes. Position of the Limbs. At first with their axes parallel with the long axis of the embryo, later rotation of the extremities in opposite direc- tions occurs. The upper extremity is rotated outward and backward through an arc of 45 degrees, and the lower ex- tremity, inward and forward. The Visceral Arches and Furrows. During the third week the visceral arches appear on the sides of the head, and reach their highest development. These arches are inherited structures that in Fish are lined by capil- lary blood-vessels and form the respiratory apparatus (gills). In the higher types the terrestrial habit is established, so that these structures become somewhat modified in their future growth. In man and other mammals there are five visceral arches between which are four grooves both externally and inter- nally. The external grooves are termed the visceral furrows, and the internal, the pharyngeal pouches. Structurally, the

151 RADIUS oblique line to which is attached the radial head of the flexor digitorum sublimis, terminates at the anterior border of the styloid process, and separates the anterior from the external surface; the internal (interosseous), round and indistinct above and sharp and prominent below, begins at the poster- ior edge of the bicipital tuberosity, receives above the oblique ligament and below the interosseous membrane, divides near the styloid process into two ridges that diverge to the anter- ior and posterior margins of the sigmoid cavity and enclose a triangular surface for partial insertion of the pronator quadratus, and separates the anterior from the posterior sur- faces; and the posterior begins at the posterior part of the bicipital tuberosity, where it is round and ill-defined, be- comes well-marked in the middle third, indistinct below, ter- minates at the middle tubercle on the posterior surface of the styloid process, and separates the posterior from the external surface. Of the three surfaces, the anterior, narrow and concave above and broad and flat below, gives origin in its upper three-fourths to the flexor pollicis longus and in its lowest fourth receives the pronator quadratus, and shows the nutri- ent foramen at the junction of the upper and middle thirds; the external, round and convex, receives the supinator above, shows a rough, low ridge near its middle for the pronator teres, and is narrow below where the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor pollicis brevis cross it; and the posterior, smooth and rounded in its upper third where it is covered by the supinator, broad and grooved in its middle third for origin of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis above and the extensor pollicis brevis below, and broad, rounded and covered by tendons in its lower third. The inferior extremity, large and quadrilateral, presents five surfaces, of which two are articular. The inferior (carpal) surface is divided by a low ridge into an inner, quad- rilateral facet, concave for articulation with the semilunar bone, and an outer triangular facet that articulates with the scaphoid bone; the internal, narrow and concave, corre- sponds to the sigmoid cavity, which receives the head of the ulna, and to the border between these articular surfaces is attached the base of the triangular fibrocartilage; the anterior is rough and raised for the anterior ligament of the

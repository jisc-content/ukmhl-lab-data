257 SPHENOMAXILLARY FOSSA thought serves to emphasize the truth of this statement. It is known that different habits develop different muscles, and that these muscles act as plastic moulds on the bones. The remaining facial bones are accessory, providing for the sense organs (eye, nose, tongue) and a vestibule to the re- spiratory and vocal organs. Sphenopalatine Foramen. The sphenopalatine foramen is formed by conversion of the sphenopalatine notch, situated between the orbital and sphenoidal processes of the palate, by articulation with the inferior surface of the body of the sphenoid. This fora- men transmits the corresponding vessels and the nasopala- tine nerve from the sphenomaxillary fossa into the hinder part of the superior meatus. Sphenomaxillary Fossa. The sphenomaxillary fossa is situated between the maxilla before, and the base of the pterygoid process and anterior surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid behind, and occupies the apex of the angle between the sphenomaxil- lary and pterygomaxillary fissures. It is readily found by passing a probe through the foramen rotundum. It is a small space that has the form of an inverted pyramid. The base is formed by the anterior surface of the body and of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The posterior wall is formed by the base of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. The anterior wall is formed by the posterior surface of the body of the maxilla. The internal wall is contributed by the external surface of the vertical plate of the palate. The ex- ternal wall is open, corresponding to the hiatus of the ptery- gomaxillary fissure. The apex corresponds to the junction of the maxilla, palate, and pterygoid process at the bottom of the pterygomaxillary fissure. The sphenomaxillary fossa contains the maxillary nerve with its dependent spheno- palatine ganglion, and the termination of the internal maxil- lary artery.

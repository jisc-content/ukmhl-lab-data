137 SWEAT GLANDS Sebaceous Glands. Sebaceous glands vary in type from simple tubular to compound alveolar. Their ducts are short and open either on the free surface of the skin or into the superficial part of hair-follicles. Their alveoli are lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium, prolonged from the epidermis or else from the outer root-sheath, and resting upon a basement membrane. Within the alveoli is sebum, an oily substance formed by the disintegration of some of the lining cells. The glands are surrounded by a fibrous capsule, derived from the corium of the skin or from that of the hair-follicle. Over the whole surface of the human body there are more than 650,000 sebaceous glands. Sweat Glands. Sweat glands are simple tubular in type, and present two partsâ€”the coil and the duct. The coil is lined by simple columnar epithelium, resting upon a basement membrane, but separated from it by a thin layer of non-striated muscle. Outside of this is a fibro- elastic sheath. This musculature, be it recalled, is ecto- blastic in origin. The duct is lined by several layers of cuboidal cells. In the corium it is similar in structure to the coil, but in the epidermis it loses its sheath, basement membrane, and mus- culature, and its lumen is bounded by cells of the stratum corneum alone. In the skin of an adult man it is estimated that there are 2,500,000 sweat glands, having a secreting surface of 1080 square meters. Ciliary and ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands. The breasts correspond to modified and specialized sebaceous glands. Among animals, appendages of the skin comprise claws, hoofs, feathers, bristles, plates, spines, horns, and penis- spines.

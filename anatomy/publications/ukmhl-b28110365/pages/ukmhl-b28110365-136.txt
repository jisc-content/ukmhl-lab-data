;132 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY Vagina. The vagina presents three coatsâ€”mucous, muscular and fibrous. The mucous coat is lined by stratified squamous epi- thelium. The tunica propria consists of fibrous with much elastic tissue, large veins, leucocytes, and lymphatic nodules. It is beset with papillae. The mucous coat is thrown into rugae. It lacks glands. The muscular coat consists of non-striated bundles dis- posed as an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer. The fibrous coat consists of dense white fibrous tissue with many yellow elastic fibers. It joins the vagina with surrounding structures. Mammary Glands. Each mammary gland ranks as a compound alveolar gland. It consists of twenty (average) lobes, each of which is subdivided by connective-tissue septa into lobules. Each lobule is composed of a group of alveoli. These are lined by simple columnar epithelium, which rests upon a well- marked basement membrane. The alveoli open into intermediate ducts, which are lined * by a layer of cuboidal epithelium surrounded by non-striated muscle. These ducts unite to form the lactiferous ducts, which are lined by simple columnar epithelium. Near the nipple, each lactiferous duct dilates into an ampulla, beyond which it narrows again and ends on the free surface of the nipple. Here it is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, continuous with that of the skin. The skin of the nipple is pigmented and contains seba- ceous glands and non-striated muscle-bundles encircling the openings of the ducts. The skin of the areola around the nipple contains large sweat glands and about twelve large sebaceous areolar glands (of Montgomery), the structure of which is transitional between sebaceous and mammary glands. In the male, the breast is rudimentary, consisting

180 THE BONES Tarsus. The tarsus (instep) comprises seven bones that may be arranged in two rows:â€”a posterior row, consisting of the astragalus and os calcis, and an anterior row, consisting of four bones which, enumerated from within outward, are the internal, middle, and external cuneiforms, and the cuboid. Interposed between the two rows on the inner side is the scaphoid, while on the outer side the posterior and anterior rows are in contact. Each bone, as a rule, presents six sur- faces. Astragalus. The astragalus (dice: the analogous bones of the sheep were used by the ancients as dice), or ankle-bone, consists of a head, a neck, and a body. The body presents six surfaces. The superior shows a broad, smooth, trochlear surface for the tibia, slightly con- cave from side to side, convex from before backward, and wider before than behind. The internal presents above a pyriform facet, continuous with the trochlea, for the internal malleolus, and, below, a rough depression for attachment of the deep fibers of the internal lateral .lig- ament of the ankle-joint. The external is mostly occupied by a quadrant-shaped facet, broad above where it is continuous with the trochlea, for the external malleolus: in front of this is a rough depression for the anterior fascicu- lus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. The posterior, broad and narrow, shows two tubercles separated by a groove. The groove transmits the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; the outer tubercle, sometimes a separate bone, the os trigonum, gives attachment to the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint; the inner tubercle is less prominent than the outer. The anterior, occupied by the neck internally, externally is rough above and perforated by vascular foramina, and below shows a groove continuous with that on the inferior sur- face. The inferior presents a groove, interposed between two facets. The groove, directed forward and outward,

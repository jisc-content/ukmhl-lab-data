39 THE UTERUS IN PREGNANCY The Umbilical Cord. The formation of the umbilical cord has been consid- ered above with the human fetal membranes. The allantois disappears, but atrophic remains of it may be seen after birth near the navel.} The umbilical duct also disappears. With the metamorphosis of the chorion frondosum into the decidua placentalis, the allantoic blood-vessels become the umbilical vessels, of which two are arteries and one a vein. The umbilical cord at birth consists of:â€” (1) Amniotic sheath. (2) Jelly of Wharton. (3) Umbilical vessels. (4) Remains of allantois. The jelly of Wharton is a soft mesoblastic connective- tissue in which the umbilical vessels are embedded. It is clothed by the amniotic sheath. The umbilical cord, with a width of half-an-inch, is elongated by the growth of the amniotic sac to a length of two feet. It appears spirally twisted from left to right, probably from the coiling of its arteries, due to their ex- cessive growth. It is attached to the placenta usually near the fetal surface of that organ. There may be one or more true knots in the cord, from slipping of the fetus through a loop. The Uterus in Pregnancy. During pregnancy the uterus affords a sheltering place for the fetus and cares for its respiratory and nutritional requirements. During labor the uterus gives birth to the fetus and expels the after-birth. As the uterus enlarges with the growth of the fetus the muscle cells increase ten times in length and new mus- cular tissue is formed, and as pregnancy advances the uter- ine wall becomes greatly thinned out. After the middle of pregnancy, by enlargement of the amniotic sac and growth of the fetus, the uterine cavity is obliterated.

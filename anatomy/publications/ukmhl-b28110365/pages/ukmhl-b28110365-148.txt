144 THE BONES ment of the capsular ligament; a greater tuberosity, rough and convex, continuous with the outer side of the shaft be- low, and surmounted by three facets to the uppermost of which is attached the supraspinatus, to the middle the infras- pinatus, and to the lowermost the teres minor; and a lesser tuberosity, oval and more prominent, and surmounted by a facet for the subscapularis. Beginning at and passing down between the two tuberosities is the deep bicipital groove, which lodges the long head of the biceps and a branch of the anterior circumflex artery, and whose external lip, confluent above with the greater tuberosity, receives the pectoralis * major, whilst the internal lip, confluent above with the lesser tuberosity, receives the teres major, and the floor, lined by synovia, receives the latissimus dorsi. Just below the tuber- osities is a constriction termed the surgical neck. The shaft is cylindrical above, flattened and prismatic below, and presents three borders and as many surfaces. Of the three borders, the anterior corresponds to the ex- ternal lip of the bicipital groove above, is rough at its middle for the deltoid, is smooth and rounded below for origin of the brachialis, disappears at the coronoid fossa below, and separates the external from the internal surface; the external starts from the hinder part of the greater tuberosity, is smooth and indistinct above where it attaches the teres minor and the external head of the triceps, is interrupted at its middle by the broad and shallow musculospiral groove, becomes prominent and curves forward below as the extern- al supracondylar ridge, which gives origin before to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus and re- ceives behind the internal head of the triceps and between the external intermuscular septum, separates the external from the posterior surface, and ends at the external condyle; the internal corresponds to the internal lip of the bicipital groove above, receives the coracobrachialis at its middle just below which is the nutrient foramen, becomes prominent and curves inward below as the internal supracondylar ridge which receives the brachialis before, the internal head of the triceps behind and the internal intermuscular septum be- tween, separates the internal from the posterior surface, and ends at the internal condyle. Of the three surfaces, the external, convex and contort-

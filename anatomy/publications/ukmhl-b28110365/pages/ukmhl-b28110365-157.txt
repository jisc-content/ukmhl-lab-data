153 SCAPHOID pisiform; whilst those of the inferior row are the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform. Each bone has six surfaces, an anterior, a posterior, an external, an internal, a superior, and an inferior. Viewed as an articulated whole, the carpus presents a convex dorsal surface and a concave palmar, the concavity being increased by four prominences, one at each extremity of each row. The carpus is broader inferiorly than super- iorly, and its anterior and posterior surfaces are rough for ligaments, with the exception of the posterior surface of the pisiform, and part of the anterior surface of the cunei- form. The anterior surface of each bone is broader in the superior row, and the posterior surface in the inferior. The superior and inferior surfaces of each bone are articular and possess no ligaments. The external and internal sur- faces are likewise articular if in contact with neighboring bones, but otherwise rough. Scaphoid. The scaphoid (boat-like), the largest and most external of the superior row, lies with its long axis directed obliquely outward and downward. Of its surfaces, the superior, convex and triangular, ar- ticulates with the external facet on the inferior surface of the radius; the inferior, also convex, is divided by a low ridge into an outer facet that articulates with the trapezium, and an inner for the trapezoid; the posterior presents a narrow, rough groove for the posterior ligament of the wrist-joint; the anterior, rough and concave above, rises below into the tuberosity which receives the anterior annular ligament and the abductor pollicis brevis; the external, narrow and rough, receives the external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint; and the internal shows two articular facets, of which the upper and smaller is flat and crescentic for the semilunar bone, and the lower is larger and concave for the os magnum.

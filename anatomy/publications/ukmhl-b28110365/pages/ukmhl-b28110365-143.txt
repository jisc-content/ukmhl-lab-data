CHAPTER III. THE BONES. Clavicle. The clavicle (clavis, a key, likened to a Roman key) or collar bone helps form the shoulder girdle. It is S-shaped and shows an inner sternal end, a shaft, and an outer acrom- ial end. The sternal end, the thickest part of the bone, is tri- angular with the apex below and behind; a second angle below and before; and a third angle above. Its concavo- convex facet articulates with the sternum, a disk of fibro- cartilage intervening, and to the sharp edge around the facet is attached the capsular ligament. A small facet on the in- ferior border articulates with the first costal cartilage. The shaft is prismatic in its inner two-thirds, whose convexity is anterior, and flattened in its outer third, whose convexity is posterior. The anterior border is rough in- ternally for the clavicular fibers of the pectoralis major and sharp externally for the deltoid muscle, whose inner fibers arise from the deltoid tubercle. The superior border begins at the upper angle of the sternal end, becomes rough for the sternomastoid, and externally joins the posterior border. The posterior border begins at the apex of the sternal end, forms the posterior lip of the subclavian groove, and exter- nally is rough for the trapezius. The anterior surface is di- vided near its sternal end by a ridge into an upper area for the clavicular fibers of the sternomastoid, and a lower for the same fibers of the pectoralis major; it then becomes smooth and subcutaneous where the platysma rests upon it, and , externally is continuous with the superior surface. The posterior surface is smooth and from its broad sternal end, where part of the sternohyoid is attached, narrows as it arches over the brachial plexus and subclavian artery, shows near its middle the nutrient foramen, and externally is con-

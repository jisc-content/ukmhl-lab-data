128 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY cells are high and whose nuclei are situated close to the base- ment membrane. Concretions are occasionally found in the alveoli. The gland is composed of about twenty simple • glands whose ducts open separately into the floor of the prostatic urethra. The organ is surrounded by a capsule, composed of fibro-elastic tissue and much non-striated muscle. The lat- ter is a distinguishing feature of the prostate gland. From the capsule, septa penetrate the lobes, subdivide them into lobules, and surround the alveoli with broad bands of fibro- elastic tissue in which the strands of non-striated muscle are conspicuous. Bulbourethral Glands. The bulbourethral glands (of Cowper) exhibit the characteristics of other mucous tubulo-alveolar glands. Penis. The penis is composed mainly of spongy tissue arranged in three cylinders—the two corpora cavernosa, and the sin- gle corpus spongiosum. A capsule surrounds each cylinder. It is the tunica al- buginea, and consists of white fibrous tissue. From it trab- eculae penetrate the organ and form its framework. They contain not only white fibrous tissue, but bundles of non-stri- ated muscle and a few yellow elastic fibers, and support blood-vessels and nerves. They are so disposed as to en- close blood-spaces, so characteristic of erectile tissue. These are lined with endothelium, are filled by the arteries, and are drained by the veins. Some of the arteries supplying them are C-shaped, and are termed helicine arteries. During erection, the blood-spaces are enormously distended with blood, and the trabeculae between them consequently flat- tened out. The septum between the corpora cavernosa is perfor- ated, so that they communicate with each other. It is termed the pectiniform septum.

206 THE BONES The Costal Cartilages. The costal cartilages prolong the ribs forward, and are the equivalent of unossified epiphyses. The first seven are connected with the sternum directly. The next three are united to each other and, through the eighth, are blended with the seventh. The remaining two tip their correspond- ing ribs and lie free between the abdominal muscles. Each costal cartilage presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The anterior surface is convex, and affords attachment to muscles. The posterior surface is concave, and likewise affords attachment to muscles. The superior border is con- cave, the inferior border convex, and both serve for attach- ment of the internal intercostals. The outer extremity is continuous with the rib to which it corresponds. The inner extremity has been considered. Arrangement of the Ribs. The first seven ribs are termed vertebro-sternal, since they articulate with the sternum through their cartilages. The next three are the vertebro-chondral, since their car- tilages are united to each other and to that of the seventh rib. The remaining two are the vertebral, since their tips are free. The vertebro-sternal ribs increase in length in numerical order, while the vertebro-chondral and vertebral ribs decrease in length in the same order. The upper ribs are less oblique than the lower, and the most oblique is the ninth. The ribs decrease in breadth from above downward. Between two adjacent ribs is an intercostal space. These spaces are broader before than behind, and above than below. The usual number of ribs is twelve on each side. There may be thirteen on one or both sides if the costal element in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra de- velops, and even fourteen if, in addition, the costal element of the first lumbar vertebra, normally present in the embryo, ossifies. The Gorilla and Chimpanzee have thirteen ribs on each

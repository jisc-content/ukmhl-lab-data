DEVELOPMENT 14 presents at its head-end the end-knob, and here is stored the centrosome. Beginning at the same situation and traversing the middle-piece and tail is the axial filament, which ends beyond the tail as the terminal filament. Spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is the process by which spermatic fila- ments are formed from spermatogonia. Lining the seminiferous tubules of the testis are cells called spermatogonia. Each spermatogone divides into two cells, one of which takes the place the spermatogone occu- pied before division, whilst the other becomes the primary spermatocyte. By dividing this generates two secondary spermatocytes. These divide and produce four spermatids. Without any further division, but by a complicated process of histogenesis, the four spermatids mature into four sper- matic filaments. Thus, from each primary spermatocyte, by two successive divisions, four equivalent spermatids are formed, and each of these directly becomes a spermatic fila- ment. This process is described more in detail with the male generative organs. It has been estimated that 340,000,000,000 spermatic filaments are produced in a lifetime. Ovum. The ovum (egg) represents the most perfect type of cell. It is formed in the ovary which, it has been computed, con- tains about 30,000 at birth. Of these many degenerate, others never mature, and only an infinitesimal number be- come fertilized. Only about 200 become mature. The human ovum is about 0.2 mm. in diameter, and is just visible macroscopically as a clear speck. It is sur- rounded by the zona radiata, which is a protecting mem- brane and not the true cell-wall. Outside of this are the layers of the vesicular follicle, which will be described with the female generative organs. The ovum contains the essential features of a typical cell, but to these special names are given. It often has a

111 SUPRARENAL BODY trude into the former as the centro-alveolar cells which, much thinned-out, are surrounded externally by the secret- ing cells of the alveolus. The secreting cells lining the alveoli are distinguished by an outer zone, next the basement membrane, which is non-granular, and an inner zone, next the lumen, which is markedly granular. These granules are highly refractive, and are termed zymogen granules. Between the cells are secretion-capillaries. Between the alveoli and surrounded by a fibro-elastic capsule are lightly-staining areas composed of groups of cells. These are the interalveolar cell-areas (bodies of Lan- gerhans), and are concerned in elaborating an internal secre- tion. Each area is made up of cells arranged in trabeculae, between which are large capillaries. The cells are not as large as those lining the alveoli, and do not exhibit the two zones therewith described. These cell-areas are character- istic of the pancreas, and distinguish it at once from the other pure serous gland, the parotid. Suprarenal Body. Each suprarenal body is enveloped by a fibro-elastic capsule, and on section is divisible into a cortex, situated ex- ternally, and a medulla, situated centrally. The cortex consists of epithelium supported by a con- nective-tissue framework prolonged from the capsule. The cells are arranged in three zones:â€” (1) Zona glomerulosa, which lies immediately beneath the capsule, and is made up of cylindrical cells arranged in rounded groups. (2) Zona fasciculata, which is the middle and thickest layer, and in which the cells are grouped in long, cylindrical columns arranged radially to the surface. (3) Zona reticularis, which lies next the medulla, and in which the cells are disposed in reticular groups amidst the stroma. These cells are pigmented. The medulla consists of chromaffine cells arranged in elongated strands that unite to form a network. Theproto- plasm of the cells is finely granular, and is stained brown by

155 OS MAGNUM Trapezium. The trapezium (a table), the outermost of the inferior row, is rhomboid and situated between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal. Of its surfaces, the superior presents a slightly concave facet for the outer facet on the inferior surface of the scaphoid; the inferior shows a saddle-shaped facet for the base of the first metacarpal; the anterior, narrow and rough, presents a prominent ridge for the anterior annular liga- ment, the abductor pollicis brevis, and the opponens pollicis, and internal to the ridge is a deep groove that transmits the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis; the posterior is irregular and rough for ligaments; the external is broad and rough for ligaments; and the internal is subdivided by a ridge into an upper, larger, concave facet for the trapezoid, and a lower, small, oval, flat facet for the base of the second metacarpal. Trapezoid. The trapezoid (table-like) is wedge-shaped with the broad end behind and the narrow end before. Of its surfaces, the superior shows a small, quadrilat- eral, slightly concave facet for the inner facet on the inferior surface of the scaphoid; the inferior corresponds to a saddle- shaped facet for the base of the second metacarpal; the external shows a slightly convex facet for the trapezium; the internal presents a flat, slightly concave facet before for the os magnum, and behind is rough for the interosseous liga- ment; the anterior is small, narrow, and rough for liga- ments; and the posterior is larger, wider, and rough for liga- ments. Os Magnum. The os magnum (great bone), situated in the center of the wrist, shows the rounded head above, which fits into the concavity made up by the scaphoid and semilunar, a con- stricted neck, which supports the head, and a cubical body. Of its surfaces, the superior is convex for the semilunar; the inferior is subdivided by two ridges into three unequal

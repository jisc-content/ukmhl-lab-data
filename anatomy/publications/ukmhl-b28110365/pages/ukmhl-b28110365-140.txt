136 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY hairs on the surface of the human skin. A hair generally lives two to four years. Hairs are not easily decomposed or destroyed by maceration. Dry hair is a bad conductor of heat and electricity, and hence it crackles when being combed in a dry or frosty atmosphere. A head-hair can bear without rupture a weight of 2 ounces; a beard-hair 2}4 ounces. When weighted it can be stretched for 30% of its length, and will resile 12%. Nails. The nails are areas of modified skin consisting of corium and epithelium. The nail presents the body, which is un- covered, the free edge (unless trimmed), and the root which is concealed by a fold of skin, the nail-fold. It is covered laterally by the nail-walls. The body rests upon the nail- bed, and the root upon the proximal continuation of the latter, the matrix. The latter projects somewhat from under the nail-fold as a white, crescentic area, the lunula. The lunulae diminish in size from the thumb toward the least digit. The nail-plate is composed of flat, horny epithelial cells, which are closely united to form lamellae. White spots seen in some nails are accounted for by air-bubbles collecting be- tween these lamellae. The nail-bed represents the corium and stratum germin- ativum of the skin. The corium is marked by longitudinal ridges and papillae, and is firmly bound to the periosteum of the phalanx. The stratum germinativum consists, as in the skin, of several layers of polygonal prickle-cells, which fill up the intervals between the ridges and papillae of the corium. Beneath the root, this stratum is better developed, forming the matrix, from which the nail grows at the rate of about one millimeter per week. A nail grows from the nail-fold to the free border in from one to eight months, rapidly in youth, slower in old age. The stratum corneum of the skin which grows over the lunula and must be pushed back is the eponychium.

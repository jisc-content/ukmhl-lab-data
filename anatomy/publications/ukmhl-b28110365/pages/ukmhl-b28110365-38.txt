34 DEVELOPMENT (4) Absence of a free allantois. (5) Rapid functional development of the trophoblast. The Human Amnion. The peculiar formation of the human amnion has been described. The amniotic sac increases in size by growth of the fetus and by increase in the amount of liquor amnii. The latter is contributed both by the maternal and by the fetal tissues, and serves to protect the fetus and to bathe its tissues in water. As it increases in amount it brings the amnion into contact with the chorion. Towards the end of pregnancy it is decreased in amount by the rapid growth of the fetus. At this time, too, the fetus swallows the fluid, and expels urine and meconium into it. The Umbilical Vesicle. The umbilical vesicle (human yolk-sac) is the remains of the distal portion of the vitelline sac after the latter has become constricted by rapid elongation of the embryo as described above. It and its blood-vessels, the vitelline ves- sels, while well-developed and of nutritional importance in Birds, are insignificant in size and merely vestigial in the human fetus, since in the latter the allantoic-placental cir- culation is so precociously established. As the amnion and body-stalk increase in size, the umbilical vesicle gradually decreases until, by the sixth week, it is very much atrophied, and at birth it is about the size of a grape-seed and is situated near the placental insertion of the umbilical cord, between the amnion and the chorion. The umbilical duct, which connects the umbilical vesicle with the primitive gut, is rapidly elongated by the expanding amnion and finally atrophies and disappears. In about 2% of cases, however, its proximal portion remains patent and persists after birth as Meekers diverticulum. When pres- ent, this diverticulum springs from the free border of the jejuno-ileum about 32 inches above the ileocecal valve, is usually about 2 inches in length, and has a diameter equal to that of the bowel.

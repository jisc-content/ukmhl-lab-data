259 SKULL AS A WHOLE Zygomatic Fossa. The zygomatic fossa is an irregular cavity bounded as follows: Above, by the pterygoid ridge on the temporozy- gomatic surface of the greater wing (q. v.) of the sphenoid, and by the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. Below, by the alveolar process of the maxilla and lower edge of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. Before, by the posterior surface of the body of the maxilla and the lower part of the internal surface of the malar. Behind, by the articular eminence on the squamous portion of the temporal, by the sphenoidal spine of the greater wing of the sphenoid, and by the posterior border of the external plate of the ptery- goid process of the sphenoid. Internally, by the zygomatic portion of the temporozygomatic surface (q. v.) of the greater wing of the sphenoid, and by the outer surface of the external plate of the pterygoid process of the same. Ex- ternally, by the inner surface of the zygomatic arch, and by the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible. This fossa contains the external and internal pterygoids, the lower part of the temporal, the internal maxillary vessels, and the mandibular nerve. SKULL AS A WHOLE. In perusing the description of the skull given above, the student should have at hand a skull that has been sprung, and another that has been macerated only. Very little pro- fit is derived from studying the separate bones in the ar- ticulated skull. The best method is to have in hand the individual bone under consideration, together with the whole skull to orientate that bone. The following descrip- tion has to do with the general features of the skull, accord- ing to the aspect from which it is seen. Features already described with the separate bones will be mentioned only, the main idea in this review being orientation.

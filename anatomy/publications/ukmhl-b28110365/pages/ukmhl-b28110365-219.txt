TEMPORAL DONE 215 The mastoid portion, rough and convex, is formed by the squamous portion before and by the base of the petrous portion behind, and presents two surfaces. The external surface is rough for origin of the occipitalis and auricularis posterior. It shows from before backward:— (1) Mastoid process, a conical tongue-shaped projec- tion that is rough for origin of the sternomastoid, trachelo- mastoid and for insertion of the splenius capitis. On sec- tion, the mastoid process is honeycombed by pneumatic cells. (2) Digastric fossa, which would be obliterated were the mastoid process sawn off. It gives origin to the pos- terior belly of the digastric. (3) Occipital groove, which lodges the occipital artery. (4) Auricular fissure, already described on the inferior surface of the petrous portion. (5) External mastoid foramen, inconstant, but when present is near the occipitomastoid suture. It transmits the mastoid emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus to the scalp, and the mastoid branch of the occipital artery. The internal surface shows:— (1) Sigmoid fossa, a gutter that lodges the sigmoid portion of the lateral sinus. (2) Internal mastoid foramen, on the floor of the sig- moid fossa. (3) Impressions, produced by cerebellum. Of the three parts of which the temporal is composed at birth, the squamous and tympanic develop in membrane and the petrous in cartilage. The former are ossified from one center for each. The latter is ossified from four centers thus:— (1) Prootic (before the ear), which forms the upper parts of the petrous and mastoid portions, covers in part of the cochlea, the vestibule and the internal auditory meatus, completes the fenestra vestibuli, and invests the superior semicircular canal. (2) Opisthotic (behind the ear), which forms the re- maining lower part of the petrous, including the floor of the vestibule, the lower part of the fenestra vestibuli and the fenestra cochleae, and the remainder of the internal aud- itory meatus.

51 CONNECTIVE-TISSUE SUBSTANCE through connective tissue via the lymphatic clefts. I hey are endowed with ameboid motion, and are only transient travelers in the connective tissue. They are all granular, have an unknown origin and function, and occur in three forms:— a. Plasma-cells (Unna), which have small granules that stain in characteristic manner by basic dyes. They may be spindle, oval, or stellate in shape, and are seen especially near small blood-vessels. b. Mast-cells (Ehrlich), which have large granules and stain reddish with dahlia-violet. They are irregularly oval and possess a fairly large nucleus. c. Clasmatocytes (Ranvier), which are irregular cells, from which distinct protoplasmic processes become sepa- rated. They stain well with methyl-violet. Connective-tissue Substance. (1) Immature connective tissue (mucoid), which con- sists of comparatively large connective-tissue cells with but little intercellular substance. It is typefied by the jelly of Wharton in the umbilical cord, and pervades the tissues of embryos. (2) Reticular tissue, typically seen in lymphatic tissues where it forms networks of fine fibrillae that enmesh lymphoid cells and support stellate connective-tissue cells. It also pervades other organs. (3) Areolar tissue, the soft, fluffy substance distributed throughout the body in the subcutaneous layer, intermuscu- lar spaces, and between the organs. Its relation to the bod- ily structures is as a thong to a fagot: it binds them to- gether. Dissection of soft parts has to do chiefly with re- moval of areolar tissue in order to display the structures,— a process termed “cleaning.’’ (4) Fibro-elastic tissue (dense), which is composed of white fibrous and yellow elastic tissue in varying propor- tions. Relatively equal amounts of each are found in the sclera, in ligaments, and in fasciae. In the latter, for ex- ample, there is white fibrous tissue to support a muscle, and yellow elastic tissue to enable the fascia to accommodate

DEVELOPMENT 28 Each mesoblastic somite consists of two parts, the so- mite proper and the intermediate mesoblast. The fate of the latter has been described. The former presents a peri- pheral myotome enclosing a central sclerotome. The lower, inner wall of the myotome breaks away and the loosely- packed cells of the sclerotome stream out around the noto- chord and neural canal forming, with those of the opposite side, the early vertebral column. The myotome itself presents an outer condensed layer, the cutis-plate, and an inner, looser layer, the muscle-plate. The former produces the corium of the skin, whilst the latter gives origin to all the striated musculature. The Fetal Membranes in Lower Types. The fetal membranes nurture and protect the embryo, and serve it as an organ of respiration. They are three in number and are called the amnion, allantois and chorion. As a comparative study, the general development of these in the lower types will be considered first, and then specializa- tions peculiar to man will be taken up. The Amnion. In Birds and Reptiles the formation of the amnion is fa- cilitated by three factors, the most important of which is the third:— (1) Liquefaction of the yolk in the vitelline sac, whereby (2) The growing embryo, becoming heavier, sinks, thus aiding (3) The dorsal extension of folds or duplicatures of the somatopleure. Between the embryo and the dorsally extending soma- topleure there appear four grooves, the anterior marginal, lateral and posterior marginal, the outer elevated edges of which form respectively the four folds, or duplicatures:— (1) Head-fold. (2) Lateral fold. (3) Lateral fold. (4) Tail-fold.

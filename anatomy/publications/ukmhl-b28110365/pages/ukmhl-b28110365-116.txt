112 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY salts of chromium, for which it has a peculiar affinity. In addition to the cells, the medulla contains large, thin-walled capillaries, which are often surrounded by chromafiine cells; many veins; arteries; nerves, and ganglion-cells. The arteries enter the cortex and break up into capil- laries that are arranged around the cell-groups. Some ar- teries pass directly to the medulla. The radicles of the capsular vein arise from the capillaries. The lymphatics accompany the arteries. The nerves are chiefly nonmedullated and exceedingly numerous, each body receiving about thirty small bundles. They accompany the arteries through the cortex, distribut- ing branches to its cell-groups. Most of the fibers, how- ever, enter the medulla and surround the cells. Ganglion- cells are very plentiful, but are confined to the medulla. The cortex is mesoblastic in origin, whilst the medulla arises as an outgrowth from the sympathetic ganglia. The evolution of the suprarenal body in Vertebrata is interesting. In Fishes the cortex and medulla are wholly separate; in Amphibians, they come into contact; in Rep- tiles, they begin to intermingle; in Birds, they interlace; and in mammals they are fused and the cortex surrounds the me- dulla. The suprarenal body elaborates an internal secretion, and is classified with the ductless glands. By reason of its rich nervous supply and partial nervous origin, as well as its chromafiine cells, it is intimately associated with the nerv- ous sytem. It has been described here simply as a matter of convenience. RESPIRATORY TRACT. Trachea. The trachea presents three coatsâ€”mucous, submucous, and fibrous. The mucous coat displays stratified ciliated columnar epithelium which contains goblet-cells. This rests upon a basement membrane. The tunica propria consists of fibro- elastic tissue, which supports arterioles, nerves, and many leucocytes. It is exceptionally rich in yellow elastic fibers

199 COCCYX The apex, directed downward and forward, is oval, and articulates with an intervertebral disk that separates it from the coccyx. In old age this disk may ossity, thereby uniting the sacrum and coccyx by bone. Those who are puzzled by the name applied to the sac- rum will probably be interested in the following lines from Hudibras, part iii. cant, ii:— “The learned Rabbins of the Jews, Write there's a bone which they call ‘Luz,’ I’ the rump of man of such a virtue No force in Nature can do hurt to: Therefore at the last great day All th' other members shall, they say, Spring out of this, as from a seed All sorts of vegetals proceed; From whence the learned sons of art ‘Os sacrum’ justly call that part.” Coccyx. The coccyx (cuckoo's beak), the most rudimentary part of the vertebral column, is devoid of pedicles, laminae, and spinous processes. It presents for examination the same areas as the sacrum. Its anterior surface is concave, shows three transverse grooves where the segments united, sup- ports part of the rectum, and affords attachment to the an- terior sacrococcygeal ligament and to part of the levator ani. Its posterior surface is convex, and likewise marked by trans- verse grooves. On each side is seen a row of tubercles that represent rudimentary articular processes. The superior pair, the cornua of the coccyx, articulate with the cornua of the sacrum to complete the fifth posterior sacral foramen for transmission of the posterior primary division of the fifth sacral nerve. Its lateral borders are thin, and show a row of small eminences that represent rudimentary costal proc- esses. The first pair comes in apposition with the inferior lateral angle of the sacrum. To these borders are attached parts of the sacrosciatic ligaments, of the coccygei, and of the levatores ani. Its base has an oval surface for the inter-

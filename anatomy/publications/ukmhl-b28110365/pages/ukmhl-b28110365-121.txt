KIDNEYS 117 The development of the thyroid body proceeds from the fourth pharyngeal pouch, and from the entoblast of the primitive pharynx, close to the second visceral arch. The thyroid body is a ductless gland. Its excretory duct (thyroglossal) early disappears, and the internal secre- tion enters the capillary networks that surround the alveoli. The parathyroids are four pea-like bodies found on the tracheal surface of the thyroid gland. In structure, they resemble the anterior lobe of the pituitary body. A fibrous capsule sends septa into each body, subdivid- ing it into uncertain lobules. The cells are polygonal in shape: their nuclei are round and contain networks of chro- matin. The protoplasm stains poorly, and is but slightly granular. The cells are aggregated into solid cords, the septa between which are rich in capillaries. They are in direct contact with the capillaries. The development of the parathyroids proceeds from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. * x o ^ a complex and convoluted type. On splitting a kidney longi- tudinally in halves, each cut surface displays the following architectural features:â€” The entire surface forms a broad, C-shaped mass of tissue whose outer third is granular and termed the cortex, and whose inner two-thirds is marked by radially-striated pyramids, and is termed the medulla. Occupying the hollow of the C is the sinus of the kidney, and into this project the nipple-like apices of the pyramids. A second glance at the cut surface will show that the cortex sends extensions be- tween the pyramids. These extensions are termed the renal columns (of Bertin), and through them pass the renal blood- The cortex displays alternating light and dark parallel Parathyroids. vessels.

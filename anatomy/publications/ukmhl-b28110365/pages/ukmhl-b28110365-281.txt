DESCRIPTIVE TERMS 277 Descriptive Terms. (1) Superior, inferior. These are relative to the up- right posture. (2) Ventral, dorsal. Synonymous with, but prefer- able to, anterior and posterior, respectively. (3) Lateral, mesial. These correspond to external and internal, respectively. The latter two terms should be employed with regard to the level and depth at which the part in question lies. (4) Cephalad, caudad. These relate to the head and tail end, respectively. (5 Preaxial, postaxial. These terms describe the rela- tion of a structure to an imaginary line drawn at right angles to the long axis of the body. Preaxial, as applied to the orig- inal condition in the fetus, signifies the part of the limb that faces the head. In man the tibia and radius are preaxial, while the fibula and ulna are postaxial. (6) Analogous, homologous. The term analogous im- plies functional similarity, as the wing of an insect and the wing of a bird. The term homologous implies structural similarity, as the wing and forelimb. Some animals have both analogous and homologous parts, as the Bat, with its wings and forelimbs.

CONNECTIVE-TISSUE SUBSTANCE 57 calcination, the organic material is removed (thereby sub- tracting one-third from the weight of the bone), and a white, hard, and brittle residuum is left. By decalcification in dilute hydrochloric acid, the inorganic material is removed (there- by subtracting two-thirds from the weight of the bone), the bone retains its size and shape, and is tough and flexible so that, if long and thin, it may readily be knotted. A bone thus decalcified is softer, tougher, and more flexible, but less elastic than hyaline cartilage. This organic matter is very persistent in old bones, 14 per cent, having been found in the vertebra of a mummy at least 3400 years old. Buckland made soup from the fossil bones of a Hyena. Physically, bone is whitish-pink or yellowish in color during life. With the exception of enamel (which is not con- nective tissue because derived from the ectoblast), bone is the hardest of all organic substances, but at the same time it is somewhat flexible, elastic, and tenacious. A cube of 1 sq. mm. of compact bone bore a weight of 613 kilograms with- out crushing, whilst a similar cube of cancellous bone bore a weight of 36 kilograms without crushing. Bone resists tear- ing and crushing strains almost equally well, as is seen in the following comparative tables. I.

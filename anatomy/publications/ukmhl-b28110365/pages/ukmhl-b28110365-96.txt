'92 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY thelium of the alveoli and ducts differs in shape, yet it is uniformly distributed as a single layer. In the ducts the cells are columnar; in the alveoli, more nearly spherical. According to the character of fluid they secrete, the oral tubulo-alveolar glands may be classified as serous or mucous. Their differentiation follows:â€” Serous Gland. Alveoli smaller. Lumen scarcely distinguish- ed. Protoplasm of cells granular. Nuclei circular, in middle of cell. Secretion thin and watery. Cytoplasm redder in double stain. Secretion-capillaries present. Represented in mixed glands by crescents. Pure serous :-parotid. Mixed serous :-submaxillary. Mucous Gland. Alveoli larger. Lumen more readily seen. Protoplasm of cells clear. Nuclei oval, and flattened against periphery of cell. Secretion clear and viscid. Cytoplasm bluer in double stain. Secretion - capillaries absent in a purely mucous gland. Not represented in mixed glands by crescents, but by alveoli. Pure mucous :-palatal. Mixed mucous: - sublingual: buccal. A mixed gland is a gland that secretes both serum and mucus. If the serous alveoli predominate, the gland is a mixed serous, and the mucous element is represented by a few mucous alveoli. If the mucous alveoli predominate, the gland is a mixed mucous, and the serous element is rep- resented by crescents of compressed'serous cells which oc- cupy the periphery of various mucous alveoli. In this mixed mucous type, secretion-capillaries conduct serum from the crescents, between the mucous cells, into the lumen of the intermediate duct. Mucous cells exhausted by pro- longed secretion resemble serous cells in that they are more granular. The arteries of a gland divide into fine capillary-net- works which surround the ducts as well as the alveoli, in the latter lying just without the basement membrane upon which the cells rest. Lymphatics and nerves bear similar relations to the glands.

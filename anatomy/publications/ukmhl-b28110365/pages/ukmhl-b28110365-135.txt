I UTERUS 131 dulla, form close-meshed capillary networks around the fol- licles, and other networks at the periphery of the organ. The veins, retracing the arteries from the capillary networks, form conspicuous dilatations in the medulla. The lymphatics begin in clefts in the ovarian stroma and in the theca around the follicles. They pass through the medulla and out the hilum with the veins. The nerves accompany the arteries and have a similar distribution. Oviduct. (T* The oviduct presents three coats—mucous, muscular, and serous. The mucous coat, thrown into numerous plications, is lined by simple ciliated columnar epithelium. The tunica propria is composed of strands of fibro-elastic tissue which are continuous with those in the next coat. The muscular coat consists of non-striated bundles ar- ranged in an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer. The serous coat is contributed by the regional periton- eum. . a ° Uterus. The uterus presents three coats—mucous, muscular, and serous. The mucous coat (endometrium) is lined by simple col- umnar epithelium, occasionally ciliated. The tunica propria consists of bundles of fibro-elastic tissue containing leuco- cytes and glands. The uterine glands are of the compound tubular type, and are lined by extensions of the surface epi- thelium. In the cervix, larger mucous glands of the same type are present. The muscular coat (myometrium) consists of non-stri- ated bundles disposed as a thicker inner circular layer, which contains large numbers of blood-vessels, and a thinner outer longitudinal layer. The serous coat (perimetrium) is contributed by the re- gional peritoneum.

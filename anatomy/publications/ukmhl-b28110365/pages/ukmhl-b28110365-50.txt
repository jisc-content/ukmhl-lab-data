CHAPTER II. MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY. The tissues of the body are resolvable into four ele- mentary groups:â€” (1) Epithelial. (2) Connective (including blood and lymph cor- puscles). (3) Muscular. (4) Nervous. Each of these groups consists of cells and intercellular substance. The cells are descendants of embryonal elements from the ovum. The intercellular substance is formed bv the cells. Of the three primary blastodermic layers, the ectoblast and entoblast are rich in cells, but poor in intercel- lular substance, so that they are compact. The mesoblast, on the other hand, is in the main poor in cells and rich in in- tercellular substance, with the result that its cells are char- acterized by being loosely put together. Epithelial Tissue. \ Epithelial, the most archaic of tissues, consists of cells placed side by side and separated, usually, from the under- lying connective tissue by a basement membrane, a contri- bution of the latter tissue. While possessing no blood-ves- sels, epithelium is nourished through its intercellular clefts, which ensure its always being bathed in lymph. It is only exceptionally supplied with nerve-fibers. By clothing every free surface in the body, the primary function of epithelium is to furnish protection to the underlying parts. Further- more, it prevents escape of lymph, imparts smoothness, and in places undergoes modifications that render it instrumental in secretion and in sensation.

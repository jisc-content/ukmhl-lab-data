DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY CHAPTER 1. DEVELOPMENT. The Cell as a Unit. The cell was established as the unit of tissues by Schwann in 1838. This investigator conceived the cell as a little closed sac that contained protoplasm and a nucleus. Some years later, Virchow announced to the world the doc- trine:—“Omnis cellula e cellula,” by which he meant that every cell comes from a pre-existing cell, or, in other words, that no cell arises spontaneously. For example, the ovum (egg), when impregnated by the male spermatic filament, undergoes division into two new cells. These divide into four, the four into eight, and the eight into sixteen, multipli- cation proceeding until myriads of cells, the aggregate of which constitutes the body, are formed. On the other hand, the whole organism may be repre- sented by but a single cell, as, for example, the minute ani- mal, the ameba. Though unicellular, yet this animal is capable of performing the functions necessary for its ex- istence, even moving itself about by thrusting forward processes called pseudopods (false feet). When an organism consists of many cells, these arrange themselves into groups, each performing its allotted func- tion, whether simple or highly specialized. By means of rapid multiplication within a limited area, cells become crowded together and thus assume various shapes, becoming oval or oblong, cubical or polyhedral. Some develop cilia, which expel secretions in the direction of least resistance.

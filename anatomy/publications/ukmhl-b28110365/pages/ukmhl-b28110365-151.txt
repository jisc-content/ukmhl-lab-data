ULNA 147 above the internal condyle, transmitting the median nerve and the brachial artery. There may also be a foramen above the external condyle, as in some Lizards, e. g. Psammo- saurus. Ulna. The ulna (cubit), the inner and longer of the two fore- arm-bones, is prismatic, broader above where it articulates with the trochlea, and continues the line of the humerus to its tapering lower extremity, where it is separated from the wrist-joint by an interarticular fibrocartilage. It presents a shaft and two extremities. The superior extremity shows the large, curved, upward projection from the shaft, the olecranon (elbow-skull) pro- cess, whose superior surface, uneven and quadrilateral, re- ceives the triceps behind, and the joint-capsule along the margin before; whose posterior surface, smooth, triangular, and subcutaneous, is separated from the skin by a bursa; whose anterior surface, smooth and concave, helps form the greater sigmoid cavity; whose internal border gives origin to the ulnar head of the flexor carpi ulnaris and receives part of the internal lateral ligament; and whose external border* rough and concave, receives part of the anconeus and the posterior ligament. It also shows the coronoid (crown- shaped) process, a shelf-like triangular projection whose superior surface, smooth and concave, completes the greater sigmoid cavity; whose anterior surface, rough and concave, receives the brachialis and terminates below in the tubercle of the ulna for part of the brachialis and the oblique liga- ment; whose external surface, smooth, concave, and oblong, shows the lesser sigmoid cavity; and whose internal surface receives part of the internal ligament into its sharp margin and presents above and before a round, smooth tubercle for the ulnar origin of the flexor digitorum sublimis, behind, a depression for the upper fibers of the flexor digitorum pro- fundus, and below, a ridge for the ulnar head of the pronator teres and accessory fibers of the flexor pollicis longus. It also shows the greater sigmoid cavity, a large, semilunar excavation formed by the anterior surface of the olecranon process above and by the superior surface of the coronoid

STOMACH 101 In the lower half of the esophagus there is a complete layer of muscularis mucosae, which lies, as usual, between the tunica propria and the submucosa. It consists of a thin, longitudinally-disposed stratum of non-striated muscle. Lymphatic nodules are present in the mucous coat. The submucous coat consists of loosely-disposed fibro- elastic tissue, which supports blood-vessels, nerves, lymph- atics, and alveoli of mucous glands. It is continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis. The muscular coat presents two layers—an inner circu- lar and an outer longitudinal. It is peculiar in that in the upper third of the esophagus it is striated; in the middle third, striated and non-striated; and in the lower third, non- striated. The fibrous coat consists of the areolar tissue which joins the esophagus to regional structures. The blood-vessels penetrate the fibrous and muscular coats to reach the submucous, whence branches extend up- ward into the mucous coat, terminating in capillaries in the tunica propria, and downward into the muscular coat. The lymphatics accompany the blood-vessels. The nerves begin beneath the epithelial cells and extend into the submucosa, ultimately reaching the esophageal plexus. Medullated nerve-fibers terminate in the striated muscle in motor end- plates. Stomach. The stomach presents four coats—mucous, submucous, muscular, and serous. The mucous coat is covered with simple columnar epi- thelium, thus differing from the esophagus with its stratified squamous epithelium. It is thrown into longitudinal folds (rugae), and its surface is subdivided into polygonal fields (well shown in tripe) into which open the orifices of groups of gastric glands. The gastric glands comprise two forms—the fundus glands and the pyloric glands. The former are distributed over the fundus and body of the stomach, and are of the sim- ple tubular type. The latter are confined to the pyloric fifth, and are of the compound tubular type. Both varieties

THE BONES 272 presents a roof, a floor, an outer wall, and an inner wall (septum). The roof is formed before by the inferior surface of the nasal bone and nasal spine on the inferior surface of the hori- zontal plate of the frontal, which slope downward and for- ward; in the middle, by the horizontal plate of the ethmoid, which is level with the ground; and behind, by the inferior surface of the body of the sphenoid, the ala of the vomer, and the sphenoidal process of the palate, which slope down- ward and backward. The floor, nearly horizontal, and wider transversely than the roof, is formed in its anterior two-thirds by the superior surfaces of the palate processes of the maxilla, and in its posterior third, by the superior surfaces of the horizontal plates of the palate bones. The outer wall is formed before by part of the internal surface of the nasal bone and by the same surface of the nasal process of the maxilla and of the lacrimal; in the mid- dle, by the internal surface of the labyrinth of the ethmoid, and by the same surface of the body of the maxilla and of the inferior turbinate; and behind, by the internal surface of the vertical plate of the palate, and by the same surface of the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. It shows from above and behind downward and forward the superior turbinate, superior meatus, middle turbinate, and middle meatus, all described with the internal surface of the labyrinth of the ethmoid, and the inferior turbinate. The inner wall (septum) is formed before by the verti- cal crest of the nasal bones and by the nasal spine on the in- ferior surface of the horizontal plate of the frontal; in the middle by the vertical plate of the ethmoid; behind, by the lateral surface of the vomer; and below, by the nasal crest formed by the articulation of the palate processes of the maxillae and of the horizontal plates of the palate bones. The triangular deficiency presented by the anterior border of the septum is occupied in the non-macerated skull by the septal cartilage of the nose. The posterior border is formed by the pharyngeal edge of the vomer and of the palatal nasal crest. As a rule, the septum is deflected to one or other side, and is occasionally perforated, so that the two nasal fossae communicate.

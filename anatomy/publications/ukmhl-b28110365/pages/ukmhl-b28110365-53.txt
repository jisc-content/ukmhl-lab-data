CONNECTIVE TISSUE 49 rect ingrowth of the epithelial cells of the adjacent surtace. And so it happens that such cells are usually arranged on the walls of pits or depressions below the level of the general surface, and, by synthesis, construct some product that is correlated to the requirements of the surface that they serve. They yield this product at the behest of a mandatory stimu- lus. Glandular epithelium, that is striated is termed rod- epithelium. Neuro-epithelium represents the most refined specializa- tion of epithelial cells. The acme of specialization is reached with the acoustic cells of the organ of Corti. As might be surmised, the more highly differentiated a cell, the lower its capability of regeneration. Endothelium. Endothelium, of mesoblastic origin, consists of modified connective-tissue cells cemented together into single-layered sheets, as peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, and the intima of the cardiovascular system. It thus lines serous surfaces, and, unlike epithelium, does not communicate with the air. In shape, endothelial cells are flat and irregularly polyhedral, and are comparable to simple squamous epithelium. They are conjoined by cement, aside from which intercellular sub- stance is lacking. Intercellular clefts, termed stomata, are seen in the peritoneum that lines the diaphragm. These sto- mata vary in caliber with the constant expansion and con- traction of their lining guard-cells, and open into subjacent lymph-paths. Epithelium is derived from ectoblast and en- toblast; endothelium from mesoblast. Aside from this dis- tinction, the two classes of cells are so similar that it is meet to refer to endothelium as “epithelial cells of mesoblastic origin.” CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Connective tissue, the derivative of the mesoblast, forms the framework of the organs and of the body. Its relation to the body is that of structural ironwork to an edifice. Hence it abounds everywhere in the economy. Even the brain and 4

DEVELOPMENT 30 The Vitelline Sac. By approximation of the splanchnopleure, a portion of the entodermic sac is constricted to form the primitive di- gestive-tube, the rest of the entodermic sac remaining as the vitelline sac. The digestive-tube separates from the ento- dermic sac, first at the head-end, and then at the tail-end, and the intervening portion remains freely joined to the mid- dle part of the digestive-tube. As the vitelline sac decreases in size, the communication between it and the digestive-tube dwindles down to the vitelline duct. In animals which depend upon the contents of the vitel- line sac for their nutrition, vitelline vessels develop, run into the wall of the vitelline sac, and take up the liquefied yolk. In man and other mammals provided with a well-developed * placenta, however, the vitelline sac remains as a vestigial structure. The Allantois and the Chorion. The allantois is an embryonic structure found in those vertebrates that possess an amnion. With its growth, the vitelline sac retrogresses, and, with the chorion, it supplants the latter as the organ of nutrition and of respiration. From the ventral wall at the caudal end of the digestive- tube the allantois develops as an evagination or outpocket- ing, which forms a little pedunculated sac. The peduncle is called the allantoic stalk. Being an evagination from the digestive-tube, the allantois is lined with entoblast and clothed with visceral mesoblast. Entering the exocelom between the amnion and the vitelline sac, the allantois expands with great rapidity, and applies itself to the inner (mesoblastic) surface of the primfi tive chorion, with which it intimately blends to form the true chorion. The allantoic circulation soon develops, and consists of two allantoic arteries and two allantoic veins, which grow out in the mesoblastic stratum of the allantois and ramify in its walls. The allantoic arteries carry from the embryo venous blood to the maternal tissues, from which it is re-

CERVICAL VERTEBRAE 191 hind, an arch. The latter is formed of two pedicles and two lammae. which support four articular processes, two trans- verse* and one spinous. % ^ ^ The body is flattened and rough above and below for at- tachment of the intervertebral disks. Before, it is convex laterally and concave in the opposite direction, and is per- forated by vascular foramina. Behind, it is flat from above downward, and concave in the opposite direction, and shows a large opening for passage of spinal veins The pedicles are two stout bars of bone that spring from the upper and outer angles of the posterior surface, and bound the vertebral foramen laterally. The laminae are two broad plates that connect the spin- ous process with the pedicles and complete the arch posteri- orly. Their upper and lower borders are rough for attach- ment of the ligamenta flava. The spinous process projects backward from the center of the arch and serves for ligamentous and muscular at- tachment. The articular processes, two on each side, spring from the junction between the pedicles and the laminae. Each superior process projects upward, and its facet is directed backward. Each inferior process projects downward, and its facet is directed forward. The transverse processes project, one on each side, from between the articular processes, at the junction of a lamina and a pedicle. A vertebral foramen is bounded before by the body, lat- erally and behind by the arch. In the articulated column these foramina are so related that they form the spinal canal, for the spinal cord and its membranes. Under similar cir- cumstances, the vertebral notches, situated chiefly below, but to some extent also above, the pedicles, are converted into the intervertebral foramina, which transmit spinal nerves and blood-vessels. Cervical Vertebrae. >a_ e T \ A cervical vertebra is distinguished thus. The body is small and transversely oval. The superior surface is convex

HUMERUS 145 ted, is smooth above where it is covered by the deltoid, forms at its middle the rough deltoid impression for the deltoid, terminates just below this the musculospiral groove for the nerve of the same name and the superior profunda artery, and flattens below for partial origin of the brachialis; the internal, plane and smooth, corresponds to the floor of the bicipital groove above, receives part of the coracobrachialis at its middle, and flattens below for partial origin of the brachialis; the posterior, convex and contorted, is divided obliquely from behind downward and forward by the mus- culospiral groove into an upper part which externally affords origin to the external head of the triceps, and a lower part, which affords origin to the internal head of the same muscle. The inferior extremity is flattened from before backward, curves slightly forward, and broadens laterally into two con- dyles, each of which presents an articular and a non-articu- lar portion. The internal condyle, more prominent and backwardly-inclined, shows in its articular portion the trochlea (pulley), which extends from the coronoid fossa before to the olecranon fossa behind, articulates with the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna, is constricted in the center, and bounded externally by a low ridge that separates it from the capitellum, and internally by a thicker, lower and more prominent ridge, while its non-articular portion shows the internal epicondyle, which is large and prominent, con- tinuous with the internal supracondylar ridge, grooved be- hind for the ulnar nerve, and rough in front for the origin of the pronator teres above, the common tendon of origin of the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris in the middle, and the in- ternal lateral ligament below; the small coronoid fossa be- fore, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion, and the larger olecranon fossa behind, which re- ceives the apex of the olecranon process of the ulna during extension. The external condyle, less prominent and for- wardly inclined, shows in its articular portion the globular capitellum (little head), which articulates with the concav- ity on the summit of the radius, and is bounded internally by a shallow groove for the inner margin of the head of the radius, and above by the slight radial fossa for the anterior margin of the head of the radius in complete flexion of the 10

THE BONES 154 Semilunar. The semilunar (half-moon), irregularly cubical and with a deep concavity and crescentic outline, is situated be- tween the scaphoid and cuneiform. Of its surfaces, the superior presents a convex facet for the internal square facet on the inferior surface of the radius; the inferior shows a deep concavity that is subdi- vided by a line into an outer and larger facet for the os magnum, and an inner, very narrow facet for the unciform; the external presents a narrow, flat, crescentic facet for the scaphoid; the internal shows a flat, square facet for the cuneiform; the anterior is large, convex, and rough for liga- ments; and the posterior is narrow, flat, and also rough for ligaments. Cuneiform. The cuneiform (wedge-like) is pyramidal, with its base facing upward and outward and its apex downward and in- ward. Of its surfaces, the superior shows a small, convex facet externally for the triangular fibrocartilage, and a non-articu- lar portion internally, rough for ligaments; the inferior pre- sents a long, undulating facet for the unciform; the anterior shows internally a nearly circular facet for the pisiform and externally an area rough for ligaments; the posterior is rough for ligaments; the external presents a flat, square facet for the semilunar; and the internal is pointed and rough for the internal lateral ligament of the wrist-joint. Pisiform. The pisiform (pea-like) is small and spheroidal and situ- ated on a plane before that of the other carpal bones. Of its surfaces, the anterior is round and rough for the anterior annular ligament and the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and abductor minimi digiti; the posterior corre- sponds to a flat, oval facet for the cuneiform; the external is narrow, concave, and rough; the internal is broader, con- vex, and also rough.

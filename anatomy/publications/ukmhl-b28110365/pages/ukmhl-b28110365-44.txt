40 DEVELOPMENT The After-Birth. The after-birth is composed of the placenta with the decidua vera, chorion, amnion, and umbilical cord. At about the end of the sixth month the amniotic fluid is so copious that it presses the amniotic sac closely against the chorion, which, in turn, covered by the remnants of the decidua capsularis, is forced into intimate relation with the decidua vera. The decidua capsularis is finally absorbed after undergoing coagulation necrosis, and the decidua vera is firmly bound to the chorion leve by connective tis- sue, and is separated from it with difficulty. The amniotic sac, on the other hand, is but loosely adherent to the inner surface of the chorion, from which it may be readily peeled off. The placenta separates from the uterus at the junction of the compact and spongy layers of the decidua placentalis. Its uterine surface is consequently rough and lobulated, these lobules, or cotyledons, being composed of groups of chorionic villi separated by the placental septa. The um- bilical cord is usually attached near the center. Regeneration of the uterine mucous membrane is ef- fected by proliferation of the epithelium of the glands next the muscularis mucosae, the integrity of which was pre- served throughout pregnancy. Origin of Multiple Conception. The uterus may harbor more than one fetus at the same time by any of the following causes:â€” (1) An ovum may be liberated from each ovary. In this case there is an attempt at the formation of two separate membranes. If these membranes come in close contact, there is usually an anastomosis between the two placentae, in which case one fetus may usurp the blood of the other, causing reversal of the circulation and malformations, such as the acephalic monster. (2) The two ova may be liberated from the same ovary, in which case there may be a common amniotic sac.

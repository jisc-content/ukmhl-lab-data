41 DETERMINATION OF THE AGE AT VARIOUS STAGES (3) Derivation from a single ovum is due to cleavage of the nucleus of segmentation. In this way homologous twins and certain monsters arise. Frequency of Multiple Births. (Approximate.) Twins—1 in 100 In Saxony, 1 in 60. In Philadelphia, 1 in 120. Triplets—1 in 8000. Quadruplets—1 in 370,000. Quintuplets—about 5 authentic cases. Sextuplets—only two authentic cases. Of these multiple births more than one-third are males, and less than one-third females. Determination of the Age at Various Stages. The approximate age of an embryo or fetus may be estimated by the characters peculiar to each stage, and by the following rules:— I. Hasse’s Rules. By this method the age of the fetus is considered in lunar months. (1) I to V month, inclusive. The square of the age in months—the length in centimeters. Here the measure- ment is taken from the top of the head to the soles of the feet. Conversely, the month—the square root of the length in centimeters. Example:—A fetus 4 months old is 16cm. in length. (2) VI to X month. The length in centimeters—the age in months mutiplied by 5. Conversely, the age in months—one-fifth of the length in centimeters. Example: —A fetus 6 months old is 30cm. in length. II. Mall’s Formula. This method applies to young embryos. The length here means merely the longest diameter. (1) Up to 100mm. in length, the age in days—the square root of 100 x length in millimeters.

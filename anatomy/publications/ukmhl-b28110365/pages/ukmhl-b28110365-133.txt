I OVARIES 129 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. Ovaries. //? ^ Each ovary ranks as a compound alveolar gland without ducts. The organ is composed of two partsâ€”cortex and medulla. The cortex forms a shell which encloses the medulla. It consists of ovarian stroma, embedded within which are the follicles in various stages of development. Ovarian stroma is the distinguishing name of the connective tissue peculiar to the ovary. Its cells are spindle-shaped and uncommonly numerous (i. e. in face of the usual findings that connective- tissue cells are scarce and hard to see). At the periphery of the organ these cells are condensed to form the tunica albu- ginea. This is covered by a single layer of cubical (germin- al) epithelium, which is a modification of the peritoneum. The medulla consists of ovarian stroma, which is much looser than that of the cortex, and bundles of non-striated muscle. It supports the blood- and lymph-vessels and nerves. It does not contain ova. As in the testis, groups of interstitial cells are present between the fibrillar bundles of the ovarian stroma. These are found in smaller numbers in the medulla. The follicles vary in appearance according to their de- gree of development. The youngest consist of an ovum en- closed within a layer of flat epithelium. Older follicles are recognized by enlargement of the ovum, and by proliferation of its surrounding epithelium until the single layer is con- verted into a stratified layer, termed follicular epithelium. This produces the zona radiata, which directly surrounds and protects the ovum. Condensation of the ovarian stroma just beyond produces a sheath, the theca. This soon exhibits an outer fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer. Liquefac- tion of some of the follicular epithelium produces liquor folli- culi, which distends the follicle. The latter is now mature, and is termed the vesicular (Graafian) follicle. 9

100 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY Tonsils. The tonsils consist of an aggregation of from ten to twenty lymphatic nodules embedded in diffuse lymphatic tissue. Their surfaces are rough and uneven, owing to crypts, and are covered over by oral epithelium rich in lymph-cells. Into these crypts is poured mucus from re- gional mucous glands. The tonsils may readily be seen with a hand-mirror, between the palatine arches. They arise in a depression that corresponds to the space between the second and third visceral arches. Solid masses of cells grow in from the oral epithelium and, by becoming hollow, give rise to the crypts. Leucocytes assemble from the re- gional submucosa. Pharynx. The pharynx (throat) presents three coats—mucous, fibro-elastic, and muscular. The mucous coat is covered by stratified ciliated columnar epithelium in the nasophar- ynx, and by stratified squamous epithelium in the orophar- ynx and most of the laryngopharynx. Above, it is studded with mucous glands, but below, these are sparse. Its tunica propria is supplied richly with lymphatic tissue, which ren- ders the surface uneven and is aggregated in one place to form the pharyngeal tonsil. The fibro-elastic coat is situ- ated between the mucous and the muscular: to the former it is bound by the submucous tissue, and to the latter by strong bands continuous with the intermuscular septa. It corresponds to the pharyngeal aponeurosis. The muscular coat consists of striated muscle, and is contributed by the constrictors of the pharynx. Esophagus. The esophagus (food-duct) presents four coats—mu- cous, submucous, muscular, and fibrous. The mucous coat is covered with stratified squamous epithelium, thus resembling that of the pharynx. Its tunica propria consists of fibro-elastic tissue, and bears papillae.

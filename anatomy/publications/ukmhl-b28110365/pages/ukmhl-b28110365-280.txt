THE BONES 276 row and the fore-limbs consequently close together. Again, the pelvis of man is greatly expanded for the support of the viscera ^nd of the fetal head. A brief contrast between man and an Ape—the Gorilla, for example—shows:— (1) In man the cranial part of the head markedly over- shadows the face, while in the Gorilla the facial part pre- dominates. In man the nasal fossae are directed more down- ward and the facial angle is greater (approximately a right angle) than in the Gorilla. (2) Man's arm is distinguished by lightness, delicacy, and refinement, and has a greater range of mobility than that of the Gorilla. So, too, the bones of his forearm are relatively long, and the bones of his thumb are highly op- posible, and prehension is more highly marked; while in the Gorilla the thumb is not more opposible than the great toe of man. (3) In man the lower extremity can be completely ex- tended. The balance of the body is maintained by the addi- tional leverage afforded by the long neck of the femur, which broadens the base of support. The length of man’s femur is remarkable. Man's sole is very broad and his foot is arched, whilst the Gorilla is flat-footed. Man is the only animal that can stand on one leg. In man the foot is an organ of locomotion, while in the Gorilla it is one of pre- hension. In the Gorilla the great toe is characterized by opposibility, enabling him to grasp when climbing, but in man this feature is absent, since his foot is constructed for supporting the weight of the body and giving spring to the step. Cardinal Skeletal Planes. The following planes are useful in orientation:— (1) Sagittal. This plane cuts through the longitudi- nal axis at right angles to the base of support: its greatest expansion in man is toward the head and toward the feet. (2) Transverse. This cuts the sagittal at right angles, and is parallel with the base of support. (3) Frontal. This extends parallel with the ventral body-wall.

THE BONES 210 produces the subcostal angle) before, by the twelfth rib on each side, and by the twelfth thoracic vertebra behind. It is occupied by the diaphragm. The twelve small joints between the sternum and the second to seventh costal cartilages on both sides facilitate respiration. By means of their elasticity, the costal cartil- ages aid expiration by mechanically depressing the ribs, and also distribute blows received on the sternum over four- teen elastic arches. The cavity of the thorax may be in- creased in three directions: in depth, by elevation of the sternum; in width, by out-turning of the ribs; and in height. by the descent of the diaphragm. SKULL. \A3 Vm / The skull (Icelandish, bowl) comprises all the bones of the head, including the mandible. The cranium (Greek, helmet) comprises all the bones of the head, excluding the mandible. The calvaria (Latin, scalp) comprises the bones of the head, excluding those of the face. Temporal Bone. The temporal (temple) bone is situated at about the middle of the lower half of either side of the skull, and con- sists of three parts:â€”squamous (scaly), mastoid (nipple- like), and petrous (stony). The squamous, thin, translucent, shell-like and vertical, presents two surfaces and a border. The external surface, smooth and convex, forms part of the temporal fossa and is grooved behind by the deep temporal artery. The in- ternal surface is concave, and shows small fossae for the cerebral gyri and grooves for branches of the middle menin- geal artery. The zygomatic (bar-like) process projects horizontally forward from the lower part of the squamous, and presents two borders, two surfaces, an anterior extrem- ity, and three roots. The superior border, long, thin, and sharp, receives attachment of the temporal fascia. Its in- ferior border, short, thick, and arched, gives partial origin to the masseter. Its outer surface is convex and subcutan- eous. Its inner surface is concave, and gives partial origin

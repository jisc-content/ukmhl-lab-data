156 THE BONES facets, of which the outer, narrow and concave, is for the sec- ond metacarpal, the middle, much larger, for the third meta- carpal, and the inner, small facet is for the fourth meta- carpal; the posterior is broad, concave, and rough; the anterior is convex and rough for ligaments and the adductor pollicis obliquus; the external presents from above down- ward a convex facet that forms the outer part of the head and articulates with the scaphoid, a groove that corresponds to the neck and receives ligaments, and a small, slightly convex facet for the trapezoid, whilst behind the latter facet is a rough area for an interosseous ligament; and the internal presents an oblong, vertical facet behind for the unciform, and a rough area before for an interosseous ligament. Unciform. The unciform (hook-like) is a large, wedge-shaped bone that bears a hook-like process, and is situated between the os magnum and the cuneiform. Of its surfaces, the superior presents two facets, an outer, narrow, corresponding to the apex of the wedge, for the semilunar, and an inner, double-curved and sinuous for the cuneiform ; the inferior is divided by a low ridge into two concave, quadrilateral facets for the fourth and fifth meta- carpals; the anterior shows below a hook-like eminence that curves forward and outward, which receives at its apex the anterior annular ligament and the flexor carpi ulnaris, and on its inner surface the flexor brevis and opponens minimi digiti, while its inner surface is concave and in relation with the flexor tendons; the posterior is triangular and rough for ligaments; the external presents above and behind a long, flat, vertical facet for the os magnum, whilst before is a rough area for an interosseous ligament; and the internal is narrow and rough for ligaments. Morphology of Carpus. In Pteropus the bones of the superior row of the carpus, except the pisiform, are represented by a single bone. The scaphoid coalesces with the semilunar in the Carnivora and in many other Mammals. In the Three-toed Sloth it coalesces with the trapezium. The semilunar is absent as a distinct bone in Reptiles other than Chelonians. The sea-

URETHRA 123 thelium, whose strata are few. The tunica propria is com- posed of fibro-elastic tissue in which glands are absent. It covers the muscular coat, a submucous not existing. The muscular coat consists of non-striated bundles ar- ranged as an inner longitudinal layer and an outer circular layer—the reverse of that of the digestive tube. The fibrous coat is composed of fibro-elastic tissue that binds the ureter to surrounding tissues. In the lowest part of the ureter longitudinal bands of non-striated muscle are present. Bladder. The bladder presents five coats—mucous, submucous, muscular, fibrous, and serous. The mucous coat corresponds in structure with that of the ureter. The submucous coat consists of loose bundles of fibro- elastic tissue supporting blood-vessels and nerves, and strewn with bundles of non-striated muscle. The muscular coat is composed of non-striated bundles arranged m three uncertain strata—outer longitudinal, mid- dle circular, and inner longitudinal. These various fibers run amuck and interlace freely. The layers are not so defi- nitely defined as are those of the digestive tube. The fibrous coat is composed of fibro-elastic tissue among which are many fat-cells. It supports arteries, large veins, and nerves. The serous coat is contributed by the peritoneum, and is related to certain parts only of the bladder. Urethra. The urethra presents two coats—mucous and muscular. The mucous coat is lined by epithelium that in the prox- imal part of the prostatic portion is stratified squamous; in the distal part of the prostatic, in the membranous, and in the spongy portions, simple columnar; and in the end of the spongy portion, in the fossa navicularis, stratified squamous again, being continuous with that covering the glans penis.

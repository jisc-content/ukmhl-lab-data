20 DEVELOPMENT plate of this achromatic spindle assemble the chromosomes— the 12 paternal arrayed on one side, and the 12 maternal on the other. This figure constitutes the segmentation-nucleus. In the metaphase each group of chromosomes undergoes longitudinal cleavage, so that there are 24 paternal half- chromosomes, and 24 maternal half-chromosomes. The fer- tilized ovum now divides into two cells, the primary blasto- meres, each of which receives 12 paternal half-chromosomes and 12 maternal half-chromosomes, so that each finally con- tains 24 chromosomes, the number constant for the human species. Thus, the purposes of maturation and of spermato- genesis are fulfilled. And in all subsequent mitoses 24 chromosomes are found. Segmentation. Segmentation is the process inaugurated by the division of the fertilized ovum into two new cells, and eventuates ulti- mately in the formation of a new being. The two cells, termed blastomeres, divide into four, the four into eight, and the eight into sixteen, this binary division continuing until the tendency to subdivision is temporarily arrested. There is thus formed a mass of cells termed the morula, which is en- closed within the zona radiata, and which is about the same size as the ovum that it has replaced. The morula is a solid, compact, spherical mass of cells that resembles a mulberry. The number of cells it contains is unknown, but the number of cells ultimately derived from it (i. e., in an adult man) has been computed at 26,500,000,000,000. i • Types of Segmentation. T. Complete (Holoblastic • ova). • ha) Equal (Amphioxus and 1 mammals, except Mono- tremes). - b) Unequal (Amphibi- t'.-T ; ans, Cyclostomes). II. Partial (Meroblastic ova). a) Discoidal (Birds, Rep tiles, Monotremes). b) Superficial (Insects),

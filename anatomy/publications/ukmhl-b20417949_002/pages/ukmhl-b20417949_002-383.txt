1.527/ ACROMIO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION Is an arthrodial articulation. ARTICULAR SURFACES — Are small, flat, elongated from before backwards, and oblique downwards & imvards. LIGAMENTS: Sup. Acromio-Clavicular - strong broad baud, from Upper pai-t of outer end of clavicle to Adjoining part of upper sjuface of acromion. Inf. Acromio-Clavicular - Similar to, but thinner than, preceding, from Under part of outer end of clavicle to Adjoining part of under surface of acromion. CoraCO-Clavicular - Does not properly form part of the articulation but is usually described with it, as it powerfully assists in retaining the clavicle in its normal position. Consists of two fasciculi, the 0!^AP£ZOID Ligament - The most anterior & external, quadrilateral, from Upper surface of coracoid process to Oblique line on under surface of clavicle - Is joined to the following by its posterior border; Conoid Ligament - Posterior & internal to foregoing, and conical with base upwards, from Base of coi-acoid process to Conoid tubercle on under surface of clavicle. INTER ARTICULAR FIBRO-CARTILAGE — Wedge-shaped with base turned up. wards and attached to superior coraco-clavicular ligament. Is fre- quently absent, and rarely divides the articulation into two cavities, so that there is generally but one synovial membrane. PROPER LIGAMENTS of the SCAPULA Are two in number. Anterior, or CoraCO-Acromial - Broad, thick, triangular; from Apex of acromion to WJiole lengtJi of outer border of coracoid process. - It completes the vault formed by the coracoid & acromion processes above the head of the humerus, and prevents dislocation of the humerus upwards. - A bursa is interposed between it and the humerus. Posterior, Transverse, or Suprascapular - Narrow band from Base of coracoid process to /nner margin 0/suprascapular notch, which it converts into a foramen for supra- scapular nerve.

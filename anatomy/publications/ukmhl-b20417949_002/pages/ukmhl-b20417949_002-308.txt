132pp SUMMARY OF PRACTICAL POINTS. (ABDOMEN.) Linea Alba.—is the thinnest, the least vascular, and the onlj non- muscular part of the abdominal wall. It is here that we make the incision for laparotomy. Behind it lie from above downwards the left lobe of the liver, the stomach, the transverse colon, the small intestine, and the bladder when distended, the anterior surface of the latter being then uncovered by peritoneum. Linese TransversSB. — Generally three, the lowest being situated a little above the umbilicus; sometimes a fourth one below the umbilicus. Unimportant surgically. LineSB Semilunares.—Correspond to the division of the abdominal aponeuroses to form the sheaths of the recti. It is over the upper part of the left one, just below the costal cartilages, that the incision is generally made for gastrostomy. Abdominal Aorta.— Bifurcates on the left side of the fourth lumbar vertebra, about an inch and a half below, and a little to the left of, the umbilicus, on a level with the highest part of the crest of the ilium. Iliac Arteries.—Curve downwards and outwards from the above point to midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, the upper two inches of the curve corresponding to the common iliac, and the remainder to the external. The arteries rest, though not directly, upon bone, and can be compressed through the abdominal wall. They can also be compressed on either side by Davy's rectal lever, the rectum yielding somewhat when compression is made on the artery of the right side.

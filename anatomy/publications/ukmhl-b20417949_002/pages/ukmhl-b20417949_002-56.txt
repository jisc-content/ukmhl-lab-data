SUPERFICIAL VEINS. Kadial - Commences at outer side of arch on dorsum of hand. Receives branches fron back of thumb & index finger, ascends along front of outer side of fore-arm communicating with median, and joins at bend of elbow with median cephali to form the cephalic Anterior Ulnar - Commences on anterior aspect of wrist & inner side of palm of hanr ascends along front of inner side of fore-arm communicating with posterior u'tia & median, and, at bend of elbow, joins with posterior ulnar, & then with media basilic, to form the basilii Posterior Ulnar - Commences at inner side of arch on dorsum of hand, receivin vena salvatella from little finger, ascends along back of inner side of forearm, am at bend of elbow, joins with anterior ulnar, & then with median basilic, to form tl^ ba=^ili Median - Commences in superficial structures of palm of hand, asceuds along midd of front of fore-arm communicating witli radial & anterior ulnar, and, after r ceiving a large branch from venge comites of brachial, divides at bend of elbo into median cephalic & median basili ; Median Cephalic - Usually the smaller. Ascends in groove between biceps & sn | inator longus, lying mainly in front of branches of anterior division of extern j cutaneous nerve, and joins with radial vein to form the cephal: j Median Basilic - Usually the larger. Ascends in groove between biceps & pronal radii teres, being more or less surrounded by branches of anterior division; internal cutaneous nerve, and lying in front of brachial artery, from which it separated by bicipital or semilunar fasc Cephalic - Somewhat smaller than basilic. Ascends iii groove along outer border' biceps and then in interspace between pectoralis major & deltoid, in which lat situation it is accompanied by humeral or descending branch of acromio-thora artery, and ends in axillary vein betweon coracoid process & clavicle, its openi being guarded by a pair of valves. It communicates sometimes with exter jugular or subclavian by a small branch which ascends in front of clavi< Basilic - Somewhat larger than cephalic. Ascends in groove along inner border biceps, pierces deep fascia witu internal cutaneous nerve a little below middU arm, and ends in one of the brachial veins or in the axilla N.â€”Numerous varieties are observed in the disposition of the veins of bend of the elbow: the median vein with both its terminal branches may be tirely wanting, or, the vein itself being wanting, its two terminal branches n be supplied either by the radial or the anterior uli

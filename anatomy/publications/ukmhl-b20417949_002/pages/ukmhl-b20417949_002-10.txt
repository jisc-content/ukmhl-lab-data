opinion generally accepted that the Progressists had but histological research before them, - a view taken up by Cruveilhier. The view has been falsified to this extent, that to Histology, which has largely branched off as an independent science, there have been added, as fields of research for anatomists, - anatomists now largely in name, - Embryology, and that indefinite and ever-extending body of doctrine which we call Morphology. On this soil, " Anatomy is now luxuriating like an exotic. But " anatomists have lost touch with the human " subject :" Their work is authoritatively described as " transcendental." A scission is upon us. it must lead to this : On the one hand, we shall have Anatomy - divested of everything not simply and purely, dissectional, of everything that was never Hees ; but, as such, once more recognised as the Alma Matee, of Everything Medical : The Newest Anatomy will be the Old Anatomy, - tried, purified, not found wanting, - reinstated in her singular position of honour, rightly associated with the names first given. But side by side with this Anatomy, there will be brought forth a Science, already budding into existence, but which is not yet correctly and definitely nsLmed,- it is 'NOT Anato)itt/, - which will satisfy the worthiest aspirations in the direction of ijrogress. There are to-day tw o intersecting lines of thought, two largely disagree- ing currents, - the neu' scientific, or theoretical, - and the old 'practical. These must be brought into parallelism.

XVlll Examinations and in After-Life," Advice to Students," - originally written as part of the Preface - have been taken from the book itself, and placed, loose, at the end of Part II., under the cover. Let it not be gathered that the Author is in any way opposed to " advanced anatomy. But he does maintain that such Anatomy* should be brought in in the right place, - that is, after plain human disscctional anatomy has been well mastered, and then without any misimderstanding as to its subordinate rank in regard to professional purposes. A word of explanation is required as to the figures. The proper use of plates and diagrams is for the purpose of identification of the several structures by the beginner, and for saving time in regard to book-work at home, and thus allowing more time, for practical work. It is hoped that the figures of this Edition will be so used. Except for the purposes of revision of work already well done,, figures should not be the objects of separate study. The senior Author is alone responsible for all contentional matter; in regard ta such matter, he has frequently been designated simply " the Author." The considerable delays are apologised for, which have occurred in the publication of this Edition. They have been mainly due to the serious character of large portions of the "Thesis" which runs through it, - as above explained. The Author has desired to carefally weigh, - and to submit to competent critics, - the grave conclusions he has been compelled to adopt in many weighty matters. That he has been intensely earnest will, he thinks, be apparent. He maintains that, through circumstances amenable to improvement, [men are far less equipped now-a-days for the work that is before them than they formerly were. An honest efi^ort has been made to establish this on the basis of Anatomy, and to suggest the remedy. * Does the lenii Anatomy properly apply?

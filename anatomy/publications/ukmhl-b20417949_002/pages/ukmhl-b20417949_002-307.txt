132oo situation named to the anterior aspect of the intestine. It is a remnant of the early peritoneal arrangement above described, and results from the crossing of the colon in front of the duodenum, - the continuous mesocolon and mesoduodenum then being folded upon each other. There is sometimes an inverted superior duodeno-jejunal fossa (Symington, Quain). See also notes on— The Abdominal Aponeuroses, p. I08a. The Lumbar Fascia, p. I08c. Kelations of the Kidney, p. I52a. Note to Criticism at Foot of Page 132cc.—Anyone may verify that the shape of the thigh alters visibly (1) in the standing- position, (2) when sitting on a broad flat seat, and when (3) resting on a narrow ledge which just supports the ischial tuberosities. In (3) the depth of the thigh from before backwards is half as much again as in (2), while the transverse diameter of the part is proportionately reduced. Sectionally, the thigh is, in the one case, long and narrow from before backwards, in the other it is shallow and broad. There can be no doubt that the internal arrangement of the structures varies with the outward form. Every muscle, hardened in contraction, makes room for itself at the expense of muscles relaxed, and, in its turn, when relaxed, gives way to muscles contracted ; a full artery (say the popliteal) furrows out the accompanying vein in proportion to the arterial tension, &c., &c. Are we to refer, under the heading of anatomy, to these shifting scenes of organic life ? If not in the thigh, why in the abdomen, or elsewhere ?J

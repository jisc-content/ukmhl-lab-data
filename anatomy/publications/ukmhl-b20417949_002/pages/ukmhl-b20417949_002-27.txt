XX i ON THE ART OF DISSECTING* " Dissect well and quickly." " Dissecting should be a fascinatin;; pursuit." § I. ''^ De fil en aiguille''''—"From thread to needle"—is a Continental proverbial expression descriptive of a good way to avoid losing small objects, and to easily find them again when they get out of sight. " Keep a thread in the eye of your needle; " and, if you lose sight of the needle, the thread, which you may rely upon seeing, will at any time lead you up to it. I was working at anatomy in Paris some thirty years ago. " Subjects " were abundant, and we used to dissect the same parts over and over again. It struck me one day, when dissecting the pterygo-maxillary region, that an unnecessary amount of labour was spent on each occasion by the method then, and still at present, in vogue, - except at the school of anatomy, - of * Extracts from Preface to the Dissection-Guides :— The methods here submitted are based upon a careful study of the several parts of the bum.an body from the dissector''s point of view. They have been slowly elaborated by daily dissections extending over many long years. They aim at enabling the dissector to make the best and most lasting use of each part he dissects. It will be noticed that the dissections are so planned as to allow the dissector to get down to the bones and ligaments without removing the superficial structures, - all structures, both superficial and deep, being thus preserved for after-study- In physiology, we have been benefiting greatly for now some twenty years by the extension of practical work initiated by the authors of the " Handbook of the Physio- logical Laboratory." No corresponding progress has, however, been made in anatomy. Admirable as are the works of Ellis, Heath, and Holden, they cannot be considered to correspond, in

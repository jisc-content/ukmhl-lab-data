(Sappt'.V.) 1, bladder ; 9 & 10, ureter (a portion being removed to more fully e.Ni'pose the vesicula seniinalis, 6); (8, 8, vas deferens emerging from the internal abdominal ring on the outer side of the deep epigastric vessels, and passing between the bladder & the ureter, and then on the inne*i' side of the vesicula seminalis. This course of the vas deferens is perhaps most clearl.v seen on the left side, ll, 11, where the ureter is not divided.) 12, spermatic vessels ; 13, external iliac vessels : on the inner side of the vein at its termination there is seen a lymphatic gland blocking up the femoral ring ; 14, deep epigastric vessels. Fig. 333.—THE VISCERA OF THE MALE PELVIS SEEN FKO.M THE LEFT SIDE. ((^Ualll.) Fig. 334.- the shape of the emptv bladder, as made out by recent investigation. The heavy black line represents the cavity, and the thin black boundaries of the viscus, which is thus seen to present an upper concave surface, and two limbs, A & B. The dotted lines represent the shape of the organ in its various degrees of distention. (Symington, Quain.) h, rectum ; a, bladder : between tl peritoneum ; at the lower & Ijack ])art of the and tlie bladcU'V, a, is the recto-vesical pouch of the adder is seen the ureter, ii ; at the upper & back part is a portion of the vas deferens, /, the remainder of wliich, shiiilarly marked, is seen in front of the pubic symphysis ; the vas deferens is seen passing between bladiler & the ureter, and then getting to the inner side of the vesicula seminalis, v. This latter leads forwards to the prostate, q, and to the membranous portion of the urethra, r, which latter further leads to the bulb of urethra, e, projecting beneath it. Behind the bulb is Cowper's gland,./'; and above its continuation, the corpus spongiosum urethrfe is the section of the corpus cavernosiun, d.

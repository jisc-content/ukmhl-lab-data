136 SIDE VIEW of the MALE PELVIS. How to obtain it (tte PerlnaBUm having been previously dissected) : - Incline bladder & rectum to the right. Divide on left side obliterated hypogastric, vesical & middle haemorrhoidal arteries, (and the uterine & vaginal in female), lateral true ligament of bladder & levator ani muscle. Saw through pubes externally to left anterior true ligament of bladder. Divide right common iliac artery & left common iliac vein, and saw through sacrum & coccyx just to the left of middle line. Detach deep perinaeal fascia & the contained compressor urethrae muscle from rami of pabes & ischium. Introduce catheter into, and inflate, bladder j distend rectum with tow. What it shows : - Towards middle: Cui edge of the deep perinceal fascia^ containing between its two layers ^ *Â» Cut edges of compressor urethrcz dr* deep transverse muscles ; Membranous portion of urethra ; Ptidic vessels ^ nerve with the vessels 6^ nerve of the bulb ; Cowper's glands their ducts. Below and in front of the deep perinaeal fascia : - Bulb of urethra partly covered by prolongation of anterior or inferior layer of deep peri- nceal fascia^ which latter passes down upon it and becomes lost on its surface. Above and behind the deep perinaeal fascia: - Cut edges of levator ani muscle i2r* of recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia^ which latter is seen further up to ascend upon bladder^ prostate^ 6^ rectum. The viscera of the pelvis and the vessels & nerves of the right side can now be examined conveniently.

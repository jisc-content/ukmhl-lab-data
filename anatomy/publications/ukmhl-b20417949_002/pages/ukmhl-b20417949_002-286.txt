132t spleen occupies a very variable area adjoining the outer border. The pancreas stretches over, or a little above, the central prominence. The stomach occupies the remainder of the upper inclined plane. The lower inclined plane of the left kidney is occupied by the colon, with, perhaps, some coils of the small intestine. The peritoneal aress. of the left kidney are the gastric, splenic, and the jejuno-ileac. On the upper inclined plane of the right kidney there rest the supi-arenal capsule and the liver. The suprarenal capsule covers a small area adjacent to the upper ex- tremity. The hepatic area is a large one, corresponding to nearly the upper two-thirds of the kidney. On the lower inclined plane there rest the hepatic flexure, with the commencement of the transverse colon, and a few coils of the small intestine. The duodenum occupies a very variable portion of both inclined planes near the inner border of the organ. The peritoneal area of the right kidney are the hepatic and the ileo-colic. In regard to the posterior surface of both kidneys, see page 132b. Mr. William Anderson, writing in " Morris's Anatomy," ignores the views on which the above description rests. (See page 152a.) In the '^subject" in the dissecting room, and when reached in the living, the kidney presents none of the markings above described.

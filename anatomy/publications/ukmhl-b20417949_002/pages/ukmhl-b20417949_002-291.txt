Posterior Surface of the Liver. Presents a little to the left the lobus Spigelii (L.S.), which looks backwards and inwards, and rests upon the right crus of the diaphragm. Superiorly this lobe is rounded off, and continuous with the upper s^^rface• of the right lobe; iuferiorly it somewhat overhangs the transverse fissure internally, and is continued externally into the lohus caudatus (Z. C), which joins the remainder of the right lobe. To the right it is bounded by the Jissure for the inferior vena cava (v.c.i.'); to the left by the fissure for the ductus venosus (f.d.v.). To the left of the lobus Spigelii and of the fissure for the ductus venosus, there are seen from above downwards the oesophageal grove lodging the oesophagus, a depression corresponding to the cardia (C), and the large omental tuberosity (^.o.)

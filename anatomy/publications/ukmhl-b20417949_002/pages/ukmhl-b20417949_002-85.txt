THE WRIST JOINT. Is a condyloid articulaiion. ARTICULAR SURFACES: The Condyle - Is formed by three bones, the scaphoid, semihmar, & cuneiform. The Keceiving Cavity - Is formed hj the under surface of the radius & by the trian- gular fibro-cartilage of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. - The under sur- face of the radius is divided by a linear elevation into two portions, the outer triangular, the inner quadrilateral, which portions correspond respectively to the scaphoid and the semilunar; the cuneiform articulates with the under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage LIGAMENTS: External Lateral - Short strong band, from Apex of styloid process of radius to Outer side of scaphoid <Sr» trapezium, ^ anterior annular ligament of carpus. Internal Lateral - Round cord, from Apex of styloid process of ulna to Cuneiform i^t^pisifor?n bones, dr» anterior anmdar tigamcnt. Anterior -Strong & broad merabraney from Front of head op ulna, anterior margin of radius iV its styloid process to Scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, &^ slightly to as mgnum. Posterior - Thinner, from Posterior margin of radius to Scaphoid, semihmar cuneiform. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — Anterior & posterior carpal branches of radial & ulnar, anterior & posterior interosseous arteries, ascending branches of deep palmar arch. - Ulnar nerve MOVEMENTS ~ All but rotation.

96 j SUMMARY OF PRACTICAL POINTS. LOWEE LIMB. Poupart's Ligament.—From anterior superior spine of ilium to spine of pubes. Convex downwards and outwards. External abdominal ring and ifigui?tal hernia lie above and internal, and femoral ring and hernia below and external, to it. Fold of the Groin.—Due to adhesion of deep layer of superficial fascia to Poupart's ligament. Urine extravasated through rupture of mem- branous portion of urethra infiltrates first the scrotum, and then the superficial fascia of the abdomen—not that of the thigh, on account of this adhesion. Lymphatic G-lands (two sets).—inguinal: Lie just below and parallel to inner half of Poupart's ligament; receive lymphatics of penis, scrotum, perinaeum, lower part of abdomen, and buttock. Femoral: Situated lower down, on outer side of internal saphenous vein: receive lymphatics of lower limb, and some of those of scrotum. Saphenous Opening.—Situated an inch and a half below and external to spine of pubes, below junction of inner and middle thirds of Poupart's ligament. Is covered in by the cribriform fascia. Its outer boundary is prominent and well defined, and formed by the iliac portion of the fascia lata; its inner boundary is depressed and less clearly defined, and formed by the pubic portion.

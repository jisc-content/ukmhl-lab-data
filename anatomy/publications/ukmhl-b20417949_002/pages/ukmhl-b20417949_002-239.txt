117 THE SMALL INTESTINE. mtes, pp. I32d to g. Is a slightly narrowing convoluted tube about 20 feet long, connected to the spine by the me. . . sentery in the greatest part of its extent. It 18 divided into: DUODENUM — Vide below. SMALL INTESTINE PROPER — is rather arbitrarily divided, no defined limit existing, into: JEJUNUM — The upper two fifths. Wider, thicker, & more vascular, and has its villi & valvulae conniventes more, and its Payer's patches less, numerous & developed. ILEUM — The lower tliree-fifths. Narrower, thinner, & less vascular, and has its villi & its valvulae conniventes less, and its Payer's patches more, numerous & developed. THE DUODENUM Is the shortest, widest & thickest part of the small intestine, and has no mesentery. Its length is from 8 to 10 inches, or about twelve finger breadths. - Into it open by a common orifice the common bile & pancreatic ducts, and the villi «& valvulae conni- ventes are larger & more numerous immediately below this opening than in any other part of the small intestine. - Its course is: Upwards to the right to under surface of liver <Sr» neck of gall-bladder : Downwards in front of right kidney ; Transversely to the left to left side of 2nd lumbar vertebra^ where it is crossed by superior mesenteric artery, and where mesentery begins. RELATIONS: First, or Ascending Portion - Above - Under surface of liver & neck of gall-bladder; Behind - Right border of lesser omentum, hepatic artery, bile duct, portal vein. Second, or Descending Portion - In Front - Hepatic flexure of colon; Behind - Right kidney; On Inner Side - Head of pancreas, ductus communis choledochus, pan- creaiico-dnouemil arterioa. Third, or Transverse Portion - In Front - Descending layer of transverse moso-colon, superior meson- teric vessels. Behind - Aorta, inferior vena cava, crura of diaphragm ; Above - Lower border of pancreas, superior mesenteric vesseia.

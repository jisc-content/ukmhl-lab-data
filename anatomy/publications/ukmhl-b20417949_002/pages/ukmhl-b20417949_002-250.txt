124 PORTAL SYSTEM_^,, 132„ PORTAL TRUNK — Formed by junction of splenic & auperior mesenteric veins behind upperj border of head of pancreas. Upwards & to the right in right or free border of lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum, lying between & behind hepatic artery & bile duct, in front of foramen of Winslow. Expands near right extremity of transverse fissure of liver into the sinus of the portal vein, and divides into right branch, the larger & shorter, and left branch, the smaller & longer; which branches ramify in portal canals with branches of hepatio artery, bile ducts, deep lymphatics, & nerves. (For distribution of portal vein in the liver and its continuation into the hepatic veins, vide Structure oi Liver). - Receives veins; Gastric <Sr^ Cystic - The former runs from oardia to pylorus; the latter] frequently opens into right branch of portal veia. Splenic Vein - Arises by five or six branches of considerable size, which emerge from hilum of spleon and join to form one large trunk, which trunk takes a straight course from left to rip:lit behind upper border of pancreas, below splenioi artery, and, at upper border of right extremity or head of pancreas, joins with superior mesenteric to form the portal trunk. Receives veins: Inferior Mesenteric (Vide below), Vasa Brevia, Left Gastro-Epiploit^ Pancreatic ^ Pancreatico-Duodenal Superior Mesenteric Vein - Arises from area of distribution of superior mesenteric artery, (small intestine, coecum, ascending portion & right half of trans, verse portion of colon), its branches corresponding to those of the artery. Its trunk lies to the right & a little in front of the artery, and passes with it in front of transverse portion of duodenum & behind pancreas, and, at uppei border of head of pancreas, joins with splenic vein to form the portal trunk, Inferior I/IesenteriC Vein - Arises from area of distribution of inferior mesen. teric aiteiy (upper part of rectum, sigmoid flexure, descending' portion & leit half of transverse portion of colon), - its superior hsDmorrhoidal branch anastomosing with the middle & inferior haemjr. rhoidal branches of the internal iliac & pudic, and thus establishing an important comsnanication between the portal & general venous systems, which communication is supplemented, according to Kiernan, by communications between the right renal vein & the veins of the ascending colon & duodenum, and by communications in the coronary ligament of the liver between the phrenic & the superficial blanches of the portal vein. Ascends beneath peiitoneum and behind transverse portion of duodenum & pancreas, and opens iatc splenio The portal R/stem contains no valves.

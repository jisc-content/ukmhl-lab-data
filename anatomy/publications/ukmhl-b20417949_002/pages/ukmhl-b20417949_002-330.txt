144 THE SPERMATIC CORD. • Consists of the portion of the vaa deferens which extends from the testicle to the internal ab- (^ominal ring, and of the accompanying arteries, veins, lymphatics, & nerves and contains i the vas aberrans & the organ of Giraldes. These structures are bound together by delicate areolar tissue, and are invested from within outwards by; Timica vaginalis, below i Fascia propria, along the whole Cramasteric fascia, along nearly the whole of the course of the cord; Intercohimnar fascia, dartos & skin of the scrotum, below the external abdominal ring. Vas deferens - Lies at the back. Arteries - -A-re the spermatic, the artery of the vas deferens from the supericy vesical, and the cremasteric branch of the epigastric. Veins - -^''e the spermatic veins, which pass up in front of the vas deferens, forming the pampiniform plexus, and then unite in a single trunk, which accompanies the abdomi- nal portion of the spermatic artery and terminates in the left renal vein, on the left side, in the inferior vena cava, on the right. Lymphatics - Terminate in the lumbar glands. l^eiYes - ■^T'Q t^e ilio-inguinol, Va.^ genital branch of the genito-crtiral, frequently a branch of the ilio-hypogastric, and the spermatic plexus of the sympathetic, which latter is derived from the renal, aortic & hypogastric plexuses. Vas Aberrans (Haller) -a narrow tortuous tube from 1| to lA inches long, connected with the commencement of the vas deferens or with the lower part of the canal of the epididymis, and passing upwards for 1 or 2 inches among the other vessels ol the spermatic cor(jl. It ends in a blind extremity, and is sometimes unconnected with the seminal ducts. It was probably connected in the foetus with the Wolffian body. Organ of Giraldes - A collection of minute convoluted tubules, probably a remnant ol the Wolffian body, found in the lower & front part of the cord close to the head of the epididymie.

It lies in the concavity of the second, third, and fourth portions of the duodenum. The superior mesenteric and inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery and vein cross it towards the left, the vein leading up to the commencement of the portal vein; the superior pancreatico-duodenal vessels cross it towards the right. Inferiorly, it is crossed by the transverse colon and its mesentery. Behind, it rests upon the aorta, inferior vena cava, right eras of the diaphragm, and right renal vessels, and the common bile-duct is usually lodged in a groove in its substance.

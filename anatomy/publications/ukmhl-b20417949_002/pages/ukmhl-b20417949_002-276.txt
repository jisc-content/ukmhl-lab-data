132j The Hepatic Flexure lies lower down, and more superficially than, the splenic flexure. On reaching the under surface of the liver on the right side of the gall-bladder, the colon bends forwards on the right side of, and then to the left in front of, the second portion of the duodenum. The Splenic Flexure lies higher up and deeper than the hepatic flexure, in contact with the lower part of the spleen (pcmcreatico-colic, - Fvofessor Cunningham's basal,- surface) and with the under surface of the pancreas ; a crescentic fold of peritoneum, the phreno-colic ligament or sustentaculum lienis, attaches it to the diaphragm opposite the tenth and eleventh ribs. The intervening Transverse Colon is arched in two different planes. Towards its middle, it lies nearer to the surface, and at the same time at a lower level, than at either extremity. The ascending colon has a mesentery in 26 cases in a hundred (Treves). It is otherwise covered by peritoneum in front and at sides only, and joined by connective tissue to the right quadratus lumborum and lower part of the right kidney. The descending colon has a mesentery in 36 cases in a hundred (Treves). In the foetus it presented a distinct mesocolon attached to the inner border of the left kidney. But after birth this became obliterated, probably by fusion with the peritoneum on the posterior wall of the abdomen. The Sigmoid Colon is the part of the large intestine extending from the iliac crest to the brim of the pelvis. Its first two or three inches are relatively fixed by Fig. 322h.â€”a transverse and nearly vertical section through the lower part of the male pelvis AND THE BUTTOCKS. (Symington, Quain.)

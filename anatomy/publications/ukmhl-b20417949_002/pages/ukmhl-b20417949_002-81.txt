57 THE ELBOW-JOINT. Is a ginglymoid articulation between the trochlea & the radial tuberosity or capitellura rt the humerus, on the one hand, and, on the other, the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna & the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius. - The articular surfaces of the radius & ulna are continuous with those of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. LIGAMENTS - Are: Anterior - Broad & pretty thick layer of superficial oblique & deeper vertical fibres extending from Inner condyle <2r» front of humerus just above coronoid fossa to Orbicular ligamentof radhcs ^ under surface of co?-oitoid process of ulna^ - to which vertical & oblique fibres a few transverse ones are added. Posterior - Thin & membranous; consists of a few irregular fibres mainly trans- verse, which connect Apex dr» sides of olecranon process to Margin of olecranon fossa. External Lateral - Thick, strong,triangular, shorter & narrower than the internal; from External condyle to Orbicular ligament of radius outer border of ulna. Internal Lateral - Thick, strong, triangular j longer & broader than foregoing, and divided into anterior & posterior portions extending respectively from Frontf and from lower 6^ back part of inner condyle, respectively to Inner border of coronoid process, and inner border of olecranon. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE — Lines the coronoid & olecranon fosss, and dips down be- tween the articular surfaces of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY - From the superior & inferior profunda, & the radial, ulnar & interosseous recurrent arteries, and from the ulnar & musculo-cutaneous nerves. MOVEMENTS — Flexion & extension only, which are limited by the locking of the coronoid & olecranon processes in their respective fossae. - The inner border of the trochlea descending lower than the outer one, the axis of rotation is oblique downwards & inwards; the path of motion lies, therefore, in a plane, oblique downwards & out- wards, which circumstance, as is remarked by Craveilhier, brings the hand during flexion naturally and without eflfort towards the mouth.

The duodenum lies in a coronal plane, except at or near its extremities, which turn more or less directly forwards.* Fig. 322c.â€”view of the pancreas and duodenum prom before. (Symington, Quain.)

Nor is the view in any way supported by the said cast as to an almost complete circle being formed by the duodenum when the stomach is empty. In the' cast, though the stomach be empty, the duodenum is distinctly U-shaped, this being the necessaiy consequence of the position of the pylorus over two centimetres to the right of the median plane. (See page 132u.) Prof. Birmingham's cast must not be taken to negative the vaiiations of position of the first portion of the duodenum. The cast merely shows that the starting point of these variations is different from what is usually stated.

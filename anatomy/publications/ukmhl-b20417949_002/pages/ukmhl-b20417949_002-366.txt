1 52A / ( VARIATIONS of the UTERUS ACCORDING to Age - In the infant the neck is larger than the body, and the organ lies above the brim of the pelvis. At puberty the uterus is pyriform in shap3; it has descenrled into tho pelvis, and the arbor vitse is well marked. In old age, the uterus becomes pale, dense, & atrophied; the body & the cervix become less distinct; both the os internum & the 05 externum diminish in size and sometimes close; the labia of the o. externum almost entirely disappear. Menstruation - -^t each period, especially when menstruation is first established, the uterus becomes enlarged, & more vascular; the os externum, more rounded, &. its labia turgid & swollen; the raucous membrane of the cavity, thicker, softer & darker in colour. Pregnancy ~ During pregnancy the mucous membrane of the uterus becomes thick, soft, 6 vascular, and is soon differentiated into decidua reflexa, decidua serotina, & do- cidua vera. The muscular structure increases both by new formation and by the hypertrophy of its pre-existing elements until about the sixth mouth, the weight of the uterus increasing from about an ounce to from to 3 lbs.; the subsequent en- largement of the uterus is due to distention. In shape the body becomes more rounded and more directly continuous with the cervix, and towards the close of ges- tation the cervix itself becomes distended, and its cavity becomes continuous with that of the body. While thus increasing in bulk, the uterus makes its way between the layers of its broad ligaments, and, after first sinking somewhat within the cavity of the pelvis, it subsequently rises into the hypogastric region & into the lower part of the umbilical. Parturition - Brings about the partial I'eturn to the virgin state. The weight of the uterus usually remains, however, from two to three ounces; its cavity, larger; its OS externum, wider and more transverse with its margins puckered & fissured.

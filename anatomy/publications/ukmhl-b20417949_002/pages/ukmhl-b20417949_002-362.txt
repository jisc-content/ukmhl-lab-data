I52d THE VAGINA. Curves downwards & forwards, following at first axis of pelvic cavity, then axis of its outlet. - Four inches lonj? along anterior wall, five or six along posterior wall, which latter is attached to cervix uteri higher up than the anterior. Dilated at its uterine extremity, constricted at vulva. Its anterior wall supports urethra & base of bladder. Vis posterior wall is covered in its upper fourth by peritoneum of recto-vaginal pouch, and rests in its lower three-fourths upon anterior wall of rectum. Its sides give attachment superiorly to broad ligan ents, inferiorly to levatores ani & recto. vesical layer of pelvic fascia. \ STRUCTURE â€” Three coats, from without inwards: - Muscular - Consists of external longitudinal & deep circular fibres, partly con- tinuous superiorly with superficial fibres of uterus, partly attached to recto- vesical layer of pelvic fascia.

60ni Front of the Wrist.—Shows, in forcible flexion, the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus. The mediafi nerve lies close to the inner border of the former. (The palmaris longus is sometimes absent.) The lower of the transverse furrows here visible corresponds to the upper edge of the anterior annular ligament, and to the medio-carpal joint. The synovial sheath common to the flexores sublimis and profundus, and that of the flexor longus pollicis, rise an inch and a half above the upper edge of the anterior annular ligament. Inferiorly these sheaths communicate with the special sheaths of the thumb and little finger, but not with those of the index, middle, and ring fingers, ending, as regards these fingers, about the middle of the palm. Transverse Furrows in the Palm.—The lowest one, which crosses the palm about its lower third, marks the upper limit of the synovial sheaths of the index, middle, and ring fingers, and the division of the superficial palmar interosseous arteries into the digital proper. The other furrows are unimportant. Back of the Hand-—Here again the do?'sal interosseous arteries run upon the interosseous spaces, and incisions should be made towards the fingers, or over the metacarpal bones. i^ee practical questions at end of hoo'k.)

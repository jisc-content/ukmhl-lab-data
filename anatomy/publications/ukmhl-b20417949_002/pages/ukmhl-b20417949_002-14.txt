" To the practical mind, Morphology is but a dazzling dream—a lovable form o£ fantasy, which, alas! distorts the vision and warps the judgment—a fairy tale, which blinds us to the facts of everyday life ! " " To such as are past masters in all that can be learnt in the dissecting- room, such pure science may convey the delights of learning and culture, and may do little or no harm. But the tyro should keep clear of all such fascinating seductions." (Allegory, - Notes, p. 108h.)

132x The Spigelian recess is a deep depression of the diaphragm lined by the peri- toneum of the lesser sac, into which the Spigelian lobe lits posteriorly. It is bounded on the right by the inferior vena cava, and on the left by a well-marked ridge of the diaphragm resulting from the oesophagus piercing it above, and from the aorta lying behind it below. Even in the empty condition of the stomach, the pylorus lies over two centimetres to the right of the median plane. Nearly half the duodenum, including the whole of its descending portion, lies in a plane not far from sagittal. The descending portion of the duodenum lies distinctly on the right side of the vena cava, and not in front of it. 11. DESCEIPTIONS Or THE ABDOMINAL VISCEEA BASED UPON HIS'S PLASTER OF PAEIS MODELS. Except in regard to the Liver, these descriptions are being rapidly superseded by those based on the " reconstruction method," as referred to above. Only the following is retained, therefore, of what appeared on the subject in the previous edition of the Tablets. Liver Its large, or so-called transverse, diameter is distinctly inclined backwards and to the left. The thick end of the right lobe is curved downwards and backwards to the extent that the greatest vertical measurement, or greatest thickness, of the organ is greater than its width from before backwards. A large part of what has hitherto been described under the surface of the liver looks directly backwards, so that a posterior surface must be described to the organ, and the description of the under surface must be modified.

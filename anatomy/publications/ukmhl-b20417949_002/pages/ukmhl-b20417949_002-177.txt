961 best be compressed directly backwards on pubes. Can also be compressed outwards against femur at apex of Scarpa's triangle. Femoral Vein.—Lies close to inner side of artery at brim of pelvis, but soon gets behind it; lies behind it and to its outer side in Hunter's canal. Anterior Crural Nerve.—Enters thigh half an inch on outer side of femoral artery. The long saphenous nerve accompanies the artery in Hunter's canal, lying in front of it and to its outer side. Gluteal Artery.—Emerges from upper part of great sacro-sciatic foramen at junction of middle and upper thirds of a line drawn from posterior superior spine of ilium to great trochanter when limb is rotated slightly inwards. Pudic and Sciatic Arteries.—Emerge from lower part of same foramen at junction of middle and lower thirds of a line drawn from posterior superior spine of ilium to outer part of tuberosity of ischium. Fold of Buttock.—Crosses the middle of the lower border of the gluteus maximus; is lowered in downward dislocations of the hip, and partly effaced in hip-joint disease. Grreat Sciatic Nerve. —Can easily be exposed by an incision downwards from above fold midway between great trochanter and tuberosity of ischium ; it lies on the outer side of, and then just beneath, the biceps. Patella-—Its inner border, which is more prominent than the outer, lies in a line with the big toe. The apex of the patella, the ligamentum patellm, the tubercle of the tibia, and the middle of the ankle-joint are also in a line one with another. In extension, the patella lies almost entirely above the femoral condyles. In flexion, it corresponds to the intercondyloid notch, and rests mainly on the outer condyle. Bursa Patellse.—Lies partly over lower part of the patella, and partly over the upper part of the patellar ligament. Care must be taken, in excising the hypertrophied bursa, not to open the capsule of the knee- joint. There is a bursa beneath the ligamentum patellae.

60j The cir(?ulation in the brachial arteiy may be completely arrested by forcible flexion of the forearm upon the arm. Skeleton of the Elbow.— Internal condyle more prominent than the external, and situated a little higher ; external condyle less prominent than the internal, and situated a little lower. Olecranon lies nearer to the inner than to the outer condyle. Between it and the inner condyle is a groove (" funny bone ") containing the ulnar nerve and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery. In extension the top of the olecranon is in the horizontal line of the condyles ; in the intermediate position it lies below and behind them ; in complete flexion, below and in front. There is a bursa over it (miner's bursa). The head of the radius lies just below the external condyle, beneath a little pit or dimple of the skin. It can easily be felt when the forearm is rotated. A Lymphatic Gland lies just above and in front of the internal condyle. Ulna.—The shaft can be traced along its whole length, its posterior border being everywhere subcutaneous. The head forms a distinct rounded prominence at the back of the wrist, especially evident in pronation. The styloid process lies farther back than that of the radius, and does not descend so low; its apex marks the level of the radio-carpal joint. Between it and the back of the head is the groove for the extensor carpi uhiaris. Radius.—Only the lower half of its shaft can well be felt, the upper half being covered by muscles. Its lower expanded extremity presents externally the styloid process, which is situated further forwards and descends lower down than that of the ulna; and then, from without inwards, the following tendinous grooves, each lined by a synovial sheath :— 1. Broad and shallow groove, divided in two by a slight ridge, for extensores ossis metacarpi primi internodiipollicis ;

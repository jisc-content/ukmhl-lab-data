POPLITEAL ARTERY Commences at opening in lower part of adductor masfntis. Downwards & outwards to back of knee-joint, and then vertically downwards to lower border of popliteus muscle, where divides into anterior & posterior tibial. RELATIONS: In Front - Inner & posterior surfaces of femur, posterior ligament of knee-joint, popliteus muscle. Behind - Skin & fascia ; quantity of fat & lymphatic glands; semimembranosus j gastrocnemius, plantaris, soleus; popliteal vein, internal popliteal nerve. On Inner Side - Semimembranosus; inner condyle; inner head of gastrocnemius. On Outer Side - Biceps; outer condyle; outer head of gastrocnemius, plantaris. Popliteal vein lies close to artery, and is superficial & external to it except at lower part, where it crosses to inner side; it is frequently double; at lower part. - Internal popliteal nerve is more superficial & exter- nal above, and is superficial & internal below. BRANCHES: MUSCULAR: Superior— Two or three, small, to hamstring muscles & vasti. Anasto. mose with perforating & articular arteries. Inferior or Sural — Two, large, to heads of gastrocnemius & plantaris. CUTANEOUS: —A few, slender; arise separately or with sural.

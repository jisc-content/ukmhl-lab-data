125 ASCENDING VENOUS TRUNKS. COMMON ILIAC VEINS — Formed by Junction of external & internal iliacs oppo- site sacro-vertebral articulation (some authors say opposite sacro-iliac synchondr- osis).^ Obliquely upwards, the left one more obliquely than the rl^ht, to "a little to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4th & 5th lumbar rertebrce, where they unite to form the inferior cava. RIGHT COMMON ILIAC — Shorter & less oblique than the left one j lies at first behind & then on outer side of its artery. Eeceirea Tributary Branches: - IHo-Lnmhar^ & sometimes Lateral Sacral. LEFT COMMON ILIAC — Longer & n»re oblique than the right one; lies at first on inner side of its artery, and then passes behind artery of right side. Receirea Tributary Branches: - IHo-Lujjtbar, & sometimes the Lateral (5r* Middle Sacral, - The common iliao veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA — Formed by janction of the two common iliacs a liitle to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae. Along right side of aorta in front of right lumbar & renal arteries & right crus of dia- phragm, passing in succession behind attached border of mesentery, transverse por- tion of daodenum, pancreas, & portal trunk. Through groove or canal in posterior border of liver, where the hepatic veins open iuto it. Perforates central or cordiform tendon of diaphragm between its middle & right leaflet?. Enters fibrous bag of pericardium, becomes invested anteriorly by serous layer of samo sac, and opens into lower & back part of right auricle near interauricular septum, its opening being guarded by the Eustachian valve. Receives Tributary Branches : - Middle Sacral, Lumbar, Renal, Hepatic, Right Sper- maticy Suprarenal, <Sr» Inferior Phrenic, the middle sacral sometimes opening into the left common ilrao. 37

132s VII.—KIDNEY. Says a prominent authority (Quain) : "The kidney, when hardened in situ, presents facets corresponding to the viscera with which it is in contact; and its posterior surfaces may have also slight depressions opposite the last rib, and the transverse processes of the two upper lumbar vertebrae," Professor Cunningham goes further into details : — The anterior surface of the kidney is marked out into superior and inferior inclined planes, separated by a distinct transverse prominence which extends more or less on to the outer border of the organ. On the upper inclined plane of the left kidney there rest the suprarenal capsule, spleen, pancreas, and stomach. The suprarenal capsule occupies a narrow area along the upper part of the inner border between the hilum and the summit of the organ. The Fig. 322p.—diagram of the anterior relations of the kidneys. (Morris.) In both kidneys : S, suprarenal capsule ; C, colon ; J I, jejuno-ileuin. In right kidnej' : L, liver ; D, duodenum. In left kidney: St, stomach ; Sp, spleen ; P, pancreas. Morris divides the inner aspect of the spleen into inner and anterior surf aces only, and that, in thisdescrip* tion, the pancreatico-colic surface is simply referi-ed to as the louver end. This is conformable with what the Author has usually noticed. (See page 116b.) Prof. Cunningham's descriptions of the spleen and kidney the Author believes to be applicable only to the specially soft structures of childhood (of course hardened or "reconstructed "), which is, indeed, all the corresponding figures are intended to represent,- though the text is widely read as applying to the adult organs.

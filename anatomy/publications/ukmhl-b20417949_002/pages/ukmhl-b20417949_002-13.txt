" What is the primary want of the physician or surgeon in regard to Anatomy ? Is it not to acquire visual and manual familiarity with the human frame ? Is it not to know, in the sense of almost seeing through, and, as far as needs be, of dextrously handling throughout, the individual man, woman, or child he is ausculating or percussing, or whose unconscious form lies under his knife on the operating table ? What is it that will give him practical insight into the actual case before him, quickness in understanding its bearings, fertility of resource in dealing with its require- ments ? Is it not mainly the trained hand that makes straight for the right osseous projection, the educated finger accustomed to the feel of this structure and of that, the sharp eye familiar with the most insignificant guide-point, and which recognises at once a little bit of an exposed tendon, or a certain small nerve, or a thin muscular plane ? What serves transcendental anatomy here ? {A Plea for Practical Worlc in Anatomy.)

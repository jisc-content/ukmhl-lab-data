PUDIC ARTERY. The smaller of the two terminal branches of anterior diyision of internal iliac artery. â–  Descends in front of pyriformis & sacral plexus, lying to the inner side & a little in front of sciatic artery. With pudic nerve through lower part of great sacro-sciatic foramen below pyriformis on inner side of sciatic nerves & sciatic artery. Winds round spine of ischium and re-enters pelvis through lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. Forwards along outer wall of ischio-rectal fossa below pudic nerve, being covered by obturator fascia, and lying at first IJ inches above lower extremity of tuber ischii, but approaching surface as it progresses. Pierces deep layer of deep perinseal fascia, and ascends along pubic arch between the two layers of that fascia to near symphysis pubis. Pierces superficial layer of deep perinseal fascia, and divides into artery of corpus cavernosura and dorsal artery of penis. It gives oS: - Inferior ffcemorrhoidal, Superficial Perinceal, Transverse Perinceal^ Artery of the Bulb, Artery of the Corpus Cavernosum. i PUDIO NERVE. From lower part of sacral plexus. With pudic artery through lower part of great sacro-sciatic foramen on inner side of great sciatic nerve. Winds round spine of ischium, and re-enters pelvis through lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, where it gives off inferior hgemorrhoidal nerve. Forwards along outer wall of ischio-rectal fossa above pudio artery, both nerve & artery being covered by obturator fascia, and divides into perinaeal nerve & dorsal nerve of the penis* I

6()k 2. Broad and shallow groove, similarly divided, for extensores carpi radialis longior and brevior; 3. Narrow and deep groove, for extensor seciuidi intcrnodii poUicis: 4. Broad and shallow groove, for extensores indicis and communis digit07'iim ; 5. Half groove, completed internally by head of ulna, for extensor miniini digiti. Back and Outer Side of the Wrist,—The above-mentioned extensor tendons are distinctly visible when the muscles are brought into action. The corresponding synovial sheaths extend from a little above the posterior annular ligament almost to the phalangeal insertions. ^'Anatomical Snuff-box."—Comprised between the extensores ossis 7netacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, on the one hand, and the extensor secundi internodii on the other, and deeply hollowed out when the thumb is forcibly extended. Over it runs the radial vein. The radial a?'te?y crosses it deeply, running along a line drawn from the apex of the styloid process of the radius to the uppermost part of the first interosseous space. Towards its middle can be felt the projection of the upper end of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Carpus.—The tubercle of the scaphoid can be felt below and in front of the styloid process of the radius. Below it can be felt the tf-apeziwn, though less distinctly, as it is covered by the muscles of the thenar eminence. Below, and a good way in front of the styloid process of the ulna, is the rounded prominence of the pisifor?n bone. Below this is the indistinctly felt prominence of the uncifo7'm process of the unciform bone. The cuneifo7-m bone can be distinctly felt at the back of the carpus, a little below the head of the ulna. Joints of the Fingers.—Notice on the skeleton that, in the extended position, the metacarpal bones and phalanges are placed end to end, and that, in the flexed position, the distal bone is found in front of the proximal one. The line of articulation lies, therefore, in the flexed

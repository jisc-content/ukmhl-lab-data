xxxu list, -not the time that should be spent in stodying the parts before, during, and after dissection. The distinction will be understood. It is submitted in this connection that the usual practice of readino; as one disserts is a wrong one, and it is insisted (see first rule of the "Art of Dissecting") that the student should learn from previous dissections, &c., all he possibly can about his "part" before beginning to dissect it. Then, where the Author avers that much time can be saved, - and much better work done, - is in regard to Avhat is "wasted" on the "bad dissections, sad havoc, abominable, &c.," referred to by Mr. Anderson. (See "The Medical Student in Mr. Anderson's 'Art in relation to Anatomy.' " in " Specialism in Medical Teaching and Examining.'" ti)nesover: tJih bring none too often, lie Uiinfo', If a man is tn heroine n prnetinxl surgeon.-' It will, of course, be remarked, and very properly, that present snjiplies of "subjects" are inadequate for such advantag-e to api^ly all round. But the objection does not meet the sound princiiile tliat, if certain work is for the good of the roiniiinnitu at large (as is that \\iii'-h is desirable, and c\ en necessary, for the sound educa- tion of medical men), and the matter is jnoper'-y explained in tlie riglit quarters, the necessary supplies for the same r,i(ist be forthcominu'. If our aim, as teacliers, is to make money - that is, to g-et as many students as we can, and to put them on wiiat "subjects'' we have, whether adequate in munber or not - then we shall never get the retiuired "subjects," nor, in the long run, either the >tudents or their fees. If our aim is to do our best for our students, our profession, and the public, and we only take on such a number of students as we can adequately provide for with the " subjects" we have, then we shall, in the long run, get the "subjects" and the students, and a fair reward for ovu' labouis. I was much struck, when I began to teach anatomy, with the above doctrine, as inculcated by Sir Henry Pitman. I may add that I took the teaching to heart, and that, personally, ] ha\ e never regretted doing so. Reservations above referred to :— Cutaneous nerves not to be taken beyond the point up to which they can he dissected with a fair amount of ease ; the ven?e comites of liranch arteries to be removed; the communications and the deeper and smaller branches of the glosso-]iharynL;eal. ])neumogastric, and facial nerves (the chorda tynipani outside the cranium excepted), and of tlie sympathetic, not to be specially looked for, except in the long-er course of work ; (all the branches of distribution of the hypoglossal nerve to be traced out). No unnecessary time to be s]">ent in cleaning the cutaneoirs surface of the gluteus maximus or the deltoid, &c. When parts are dissected several times over, as in " prose^M inu," tliey ran be lii^-i eted tlioroughly - dissections worth keeping - in about half the time named. The Author's prosectors .iissect, to the fullest extent of honest dissecting-room work, the lower limb in from fifteen to twenty hours, and the upper liiub in from ten to fifteen hours. For those who have the opportunities, and who know how to use them, rapidity in dissecting is a mere matter of practice. Of the second year's men in the Author's dissecting- room (session of 18f).'i), one has dissected the triangles of the neck six times, and atiother has dissected the arm five times. A young fellow who has been at wor1\ for some fi\e months only, has dissected the thorax three times, the aliilomen twic?, tlie aim twice, once (partl\,at h-ast) tlie head and neck.

132i In about five per cent, of the cases the reflection of the peritoneum occurs at a lower level, the posterior aspect of the caecum then being more or less uninvested by peritoneum, and connected with the iliac fascia by areolar tissue only. As will be seen below, the ileo-caecal valve differs considerably in the fresh condition from what is represented in Fig. 305, page 118a, where it is shown in the di-ied inflated specimen. Fig. 322g.â€”the interior of the fresh CiECUM. (Symington, Quain.) a, ileum ; 6, its mesentery ; c, c, caecum ; d, opening of vermiform appendix ; e, ileo-caeca valve ; /, its upper lip ; g, its lower lip ; h, ascending colon. The distended caecum comes in contact with the anterior wall of the abdomen just above the outer half of Poupart's ligament. The ileo-CEecal valve lies opposite a point on the anterior abdominal wall one or two inches internal to, and a little above, the anterior superior spine of the ileum.* * Prof. Cunningham places the ileo.caecal valve just to the right of the right mid-Poupart plane immediately above the intertubercular plane. He places the opening- of the vermiform appendix in the right mid-Poupart plane immediately helotv the intertubercular plane.

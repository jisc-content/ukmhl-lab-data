" He (Mr. Cooke) would have teachers and examiners, not specialists, but men of a general knowledge of both anatomy and physiology. This would result in a much sounder valuation of the details of both subjects, and would improve the character of the examination."—British Medical Journal. " Mr. Cooke has done good service in bringing this subject prominently before the profession. It is one that requires very thoughtful consideration with a view to reform.*'—The Lancet. ". . . . plain speaking and hard hitting; but Mr. Cooke is right in what he says. Men go up for examination; they are prepared ; they are examined ; they are not educated. This is probably due to the cause to which Mr. Cooke attributes it. Too much attention is given to the science of the subject—too much because it precludes sufficient attention to the art. But the science is only of use as a base for the art The education of every medical student is a matter of importance to every individual, medical or otherwise. The public has a right to demand that the best methods shall be used—the profession has a right to demand that its interests and its honourable traditions shall be maintained.'*—Medical Magazine.

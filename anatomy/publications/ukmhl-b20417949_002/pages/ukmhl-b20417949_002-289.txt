132w Lire.-. In regard to the liver, the fissure for the ducttia venosus, and the lobus Spigelii differ Tnaterially, says Prof. Birmingham, from what is presented in the current descriptions of His and other modem anatomists following that scientist. The fissure for the ductus vencsus is greatly deepened by the folding backward of the left lobe of the liver against the lobus Spigelii. In a horizontal section, this fissure Fig. 322t.—sketch of the livee is bbaujte's platk n. (mesial sectios of female body). D.Y., fissure for ductus renosua ; S.L., Spigelian lobe (Birmingham). is seen to run outwards and to the right for over an inch, and to reach a point about three- quarters of an inch in front of the fissure for the inferior vena cava. The lobus Spigelii Fig. 322r.—HORizoyTAL section at the level op the 11th dorsal vertebra, from a frozex SECTioy, (Birmingham.) A, aorta ; D, diaphragm ; D.T., fiaaure for ductus venosus ; S.L., SpigeUan lobe ; V.C., vena cava. thus becomes, in a horizontal section, a projecting pyramidal mass with three suifaces, one lodged in the Spigelian recess of the^diaphragm, one in contact with the inferior vena cava, and one in contact, as explained, with the back of the left lobe.

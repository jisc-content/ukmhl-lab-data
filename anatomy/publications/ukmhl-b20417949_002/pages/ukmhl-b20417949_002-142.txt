84 POSTEBIOE TIBIAL ABTERY Posterior & larger branch of bifurcation of popliteal opposite lower border of poplitetia muscle. Downwards & inwards upon tibialis posticus, flexor longua digitorum, lower end of tibia & ankle joint, being covered by gastrocnemius, soleus and deep layer of fascia in upper two-thirds, and, in lower third, by integument & fascia only on inner side of tendo Achillis. Diyides into the two plantar arteries midway between internal malleolus & heel, and between tendons of tibialis posticus & flexor longus digitorum, which are anterior & internal to it, and tendon of flexor longus pollicis, which lies posterior & external. Posterior tibial nerye is first posterior & internal to it, but soon crosses to its outer side. BRANCHES: Peroneal — Arises an inch below lower border of poplite^is. Downwards & outwards upon tibialis posticus & flexor long-^is poUicis & betweeti fibres of latter muscle, and beneath soleus & deep layer of fascia, and ends on outer side of os calcis, joining with external malleolar & sxternal plantar. Gives off branches • Muscular - To soleus & muscles of deep layer, and peronei. Nutrient to Fibula - Downwards in nutrient canal towards lower extremity of the bone. Communicating to Post. Tibial - Inwards beneath flexor tendons a little above ankle joint. " Ant. Peroneal - The largest branch. Through interosseous membrane two inches above malleoli. Downwards beneath peroneus tertiua to outer side of tarsus, and joins with external malleolar & tarsal. Muscular — To soleus & muscles of deep layer. Nutrient to Tibia — The largest of the nutrient arteries. - Downwards in nutrient canal towards lower extremity of the bone Communicating to Peroneal — Outwards beneath flexor tendons a little above ankle joint Internal calcanean integument & fat ^boat tendo Achillis & heel.

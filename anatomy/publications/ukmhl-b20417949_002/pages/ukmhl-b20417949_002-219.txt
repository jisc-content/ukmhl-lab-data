108o seeing things. Hopeless confusion, he submits, must follow all such abstract descriptions, as compared with the delightfully lucid conceptions which result from seeing. It is on this ground that the Author ventures to disagree with the description of a "periuEcal ledge." He unhesitatingly asserts that there is no such structure in the human perinieum. Further, to make the obturator fascia continuous with the deep layer of the deep perinaeal fascia or triangular ligament, when the i-ami of the pubes and ischia intervene between them, is, to the Author's mind, like reverting to the old description of the origins of the flexor and extensor carpi ulnares from a common layer of fascia at the back of the forearm, when one muscle is one on side of the ulna, and the other muscle on the other side. There are properly no two layers to the superficial fascia of the perinasum, as there are in the regions of the Inguinal and Femoral hernise. What is usually termed the " deep layer of the superficial fascia of the periuaiuin " binds down the superficial muscles of the perinseum, and corresponds to the deep fascia of other regions. In referring to this latter structure the double designation should be used " deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinajum, or superficial perinatal fascia," just as, for the deeper structure, we use the double term " deep perinatal fascia, or triangular ligament." This is cumbrous,no doubt, but it is submitted that c.imbrousness is the lesser of the two evils: - as matters stand, the single term " deep perineal fascia " cannot consistently be applied alone to the " triangular ligament," and to revive the old designation " Colles fascia " in connection with the fascial covering to the superficial muscles simply conceals the difiiculty, and therefore renders it the niore dangerous.

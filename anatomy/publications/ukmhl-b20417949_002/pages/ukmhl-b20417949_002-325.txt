141 THE TESTICLE & EPIDIDYMIS. THE TESTICLE Is oval <fc compressed laterally, and so suspended by the spermatic cord as to present ? Upper Extremity - The largest, directed forwards & outwards. Presents a small pedun- culated body, the hydatid of Morgagni, probably a remnant of Muller's duct. Lower Extremity - The smaller, directed backwards & inwards. La<teral Surfaces - Looking respectively forwards & inwards, and backwards & outwards. Anterior Border - Convex, directed forwards, downwards & outwards. - All these parts are free, smooth, and entirely invested by the tunica vaginalis propria. Posterior Border - Straight & flattened, directed backwards, upwards & inwards, covered by the epididymis & vas deferens, and only partly invested by the tunica vaginalis. The left testicle lies a little lower than the right one, and is frequently a littla larger, THE EPIDIDYMIS Lies on the posterior border and back part of the outer surface of the testicle, and has the vas deferens on its inner side. It presents : Globus Major or Head - Its upper enlarged extremity, connected to the testicle by the efferent ducts of the latter. Body - Free, surrounded by the tunica vaginalis, which dips in between it & the testicle along its outer border, and connects its inner or posterior border to the posterior border of the testicle. OlobUS Minor or Tail - its lower pointed extremity, attached to the testicle by dense fibrous tissue. The tunica vaginalis covers the whole of the upper or outer surface of the epididymis, as well as the under surface of its body. - The vas aber- rans of Sailer communicates with the canal of the epididymis or with the commencement of the vas deferens

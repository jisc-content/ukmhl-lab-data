60g SUMMARY OF PRACTICAL POINTS. UPPER LIMB. Clavicle.—Convex anteriorly, and rounded in its inner two-thirds ; concave anteriorly, and flattened from above downwards in its outer third; forms a nearly horizontal buttress, through which the shoulder is supported on the sternum. Head of the Humerus.—Projects beyond the acromion when the arm hangs down by the side, thus causing the convexity of the shoulder. When the arm is raised, the convexity is replaced by a slight depression, and the head of the humerus can then be felt in the axilla. The greater tuberosity faces in the direction of the outer condyle. The articular surface faces in the direction of the inner condyle. The lesser tuberosity looks forwards and slightly inwards. The bicipital groove faces directly forwards. The upper epiphysis of the humerus includes the articular surface and both tuberosities. Coracoid Process.—its i-nner border lies behind the intermuscular space between the deltoid and the pectoralis major. Its apex lies somewhat beneath the deltoid. Both can be distinctly felt when the arm is abducted. Axillary Artery.—Lies first just to the inner side of the coracoid process, and can here be compressed against the second rib, though with difficulty, and not for long. The position of the artery is here indicated by a line drawn from junction of outer and middle thirds of clavicle to outer part of axilla. Lower down the artery lies behind the coraco-bi'achialis and short head of the biceps, on the inner side of the head of the humerus. This being depressed by the raising of the arm, the artery can be compressed against it in the outward direction. The position of the artery is here indicated by a

132rr Inguinal Canal.—Runs obliquely downwards and inwards above the inner half of Poupart's ligament. Is from an inch and a half to two inches long. Its boundaries are as follows:— Iisr Front.—Aponeurosis of exteriial oblique along its whole length ; lower arched jB.bres of internal oblique and transversalis along its outer third. Behind.—Fascia transversalis along its whole length ; conjoined tendon of internal oblique and transversalis, and also the triangular ligament^ along its inner third. Abo YE.—Lower arched fibi^es of internal oblique and transvejsalis. Below.—Pouparfs ligametit blended posteriorly with the fascia trans- versalis. Deep Epigastric Artery.—Euns from inner border of internal abdominal ring to middle of the rectus muscle. The incision for the extra peritoneal ligatu?'e of either the common^ or the upper pai't of the external iliac artery, should lie entirely on its outer side. For ligature of the lower part of the external iliac artery, the incision may be made internal to the artery ; but this is not, as a rule, a good operation. Abnormal Obturator Artery.—Spine of ilium, Poupart's ligament, glands of groin.—See " Lower Limb." {See practical questions at end of book.)

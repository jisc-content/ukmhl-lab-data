132a Added, 1897. NOTES ON THE NEWEE MATTEE. THE NEW OR "RECONSTRUCTED" ABDOMEN. The phrase ' The New or 'Reconstructed' Abdomen" seems justified by the crowd of modified relations now given, based upon the so-called "reconstruction method." It is easj, by freezing, or by the prolonged injection of chromic acid, corrosive sublimate, formalin, and other reagents, to sufficiently harden the solid viscera to allow of the examination of their preserved "life-like" or "reconstructed" forms. The method is still somewhat a new one; but the results already attained may safely be taken as submitted further on. The Author does not hold himself responsible for the descriptions given, which^ indeed, do not, in some respects, tally one with the other. Taken, however, as they are, from the best sources, he believes them to be, in the main, correct ivithin the limits of their true significance, - that is, as referable to the " reconstructed''^ data* obtainable through the examination of numerous frozen or otherwise hardened subjects. They are of course unverifiable by the student or the practitioner. The subject-matter they embody is an object of study in every way commendable, as far as it is inspired by a love of knowledge for knowledge' sake, and irrespectively of the advantages, or disadvantages, of pressing the same, as an examination-subject, on those who are about to be called to medical practice. It is contended, however, that the pressing of such subject-matter in the latter aspect cannot be looked upon otherwise than as a direct inducement to " cram."

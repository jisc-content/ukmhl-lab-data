151 BRANCHES of the INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY-Srd T. BRANCHES FROM POSTERIOR DIVISION. Ilio-Lumbar - Arises from upper part of posterior division. Ascends beneath psoas to ripper part of iliac fossa, where it dirides into : Lumbar Br^ch - To psoas & quadratus lumborum, communicating with last lumbar artery, and sending a small spinal branch through interver- tebral foramen between last lumbar vertebra & sacrum; Iliac Branch - To iliacus & ilium, and along crest anastomosing with circum- flex iliac. Lateral Sacral - Usually two, superior & inferior. Downwards and inwards in front of pyriformis & sacral plexus, and along inaer side of anterior sacral foramina, anastomosing with middle sacral and giving ofl DoBSAL Branches - Through anterior sacral foramina to contents of spinal canal, and then through posterior sacral foramina to skin & rauscle? on back of sacrum. Gluteal - The largest branch of internal iliac, and the continuation of its posterior division. Through great sacro-sciatic foramen above pyriformis, and then between latter mus- cle & gluteus medius, and divides into: Superficial Branch - Gives off numerous branches to gluteus maximus & in- tegument over sacrum; Deep Branch - Forwards between glutei medius & minimus, and divides intoj Superior Division - Along upper border of gluteus minimus towards an. terior superior spine of ilium, and joins with circumflex ''liac. Inferior Division - Crosses gluteus minimus towards great trochanter, and joins with ascending branches of ext<e^nal circumflex.

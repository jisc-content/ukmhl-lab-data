132kk mesogastrium. The commencement of the colon thus lavs itself, with its mesentery, over, or in front of, or ventral to, the duodenum. The terminal portion of the colon similarly moves to the left. The displacement of the intestine above referred to is described by Mr. Treves as being due to the rotation of the intestine and mesenterj- round the line of the superior mesenteric arterj-. Bj' this rota- tion the superior mesenteric artery is brought to he behind the transverse colon and in front of the duodenum, and to give ofit the vasa intestini tenuis from its Uft side, and the principal colic arteries from its rigM side. The morphological termination of the superior mesenteric artery is at Meckel's diverticulum. At this time the large intestine consists of c^cum, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid flexure and rectum. There is as yet no ascending colon. This is formed by the extension downwards of the commencement of the large intestine ig. 322BBj. by which the cttcum descends from below the liver to its final position in the right iliac fossa. II. (A.) - Hertwig's and His's Statement 'Adhesion Theory^ :â€” The disjjlaced duodenum and ascending and descending poitions of the colon adhere to the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall, - each losing its mesentery, completely, or nearly so. The transverse colon retains its mesentery (transverse mesocolon), at least in part, but acquires a new attachment to the posterior wall of the abdomen, along a transverse line which crosses the duodenum. There now descends from the greater curvature of the stomach, - in front of the transverse colon, and, later on, in front of the coils of the small intestine (Figs. 322dd & ee). - an extension of the mesogastrium, which becomes the great omentum. This consists of two double folds of peritoneum. The anterior double fold, which contains the

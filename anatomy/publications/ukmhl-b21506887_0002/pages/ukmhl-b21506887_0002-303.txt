Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 253 SPLEEN. The Spleen is a soft, very Vascular Substance, and of a purple colour. It is somewhat depressed, is of a long oval form, and of considerable size, but varying in this last respect in different subjects. Its medium length is about five or six inches ; its weight, twelve or fourteen ounces. In the upright position of the Body it is situated al- most vertically, in the left Hypochondriac Region, be- tween the large extremity of the Stomach and corre- sponding False Ribs ;—its under end lying behind the Colon, and over the top of the Left Kidney. The Situation of the Spleen varies a little, accord- ing to the state of Respiration, and to the fulness of the Stomach;—rising or falling as the Lungs are less or more dilated,—and becoming more oblique in its situation, with its inferior extremity turned more forwards, in proportion as the Stomach becomes more distended. Its form and size also vary a little, according to the degree of pressure it receives from the Stomach. Its External Surface is convex, and uniform, corre- sponding with the Surface of the Ribs, &c. to which it is opposed. Its Internal Surface^ or that next the Spine, is irre- gularly concave, and is divided into an Anterior and a Posterior Plane, by a Longitudinal Groove or Fissure, where the Vessels and Nerves enter. The Anterior Plane is more concave than the Poste- rior, corresponding to the contiguous convexity of the Stomach, with which it is in close contact.

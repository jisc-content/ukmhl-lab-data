Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Ovaria at this time having nearly the same situation with the Testes in a Male. The external Abdominal Ring in a Foetus has ' nearly the same situation with respect to the Crest of the Pubis, as in an Adult Body ; but at this time the upper and under Rings are opposite to each other, and almost in contact. By degrees the Upper Ring changes its position) and is situated nearer the Anterior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium, the Abdominal or Inguinal Canal in- creasing gradually in obliquity and length, as the Pel- vis increases in wideness.

By the Umbilical Vein, it goes principally to be cir- culated in the Liver ; a small portion of it passing by the Ductus Venosus to the right Auricle of the Heart.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 191 rounding parts, by the pulsation of the adjacent Arte- ries, by the weight of the Column of Blood in the Veins in certain parts of the Body, and, as some sup- pose, by a contractile power in the Veins themselves, it is driven again to the Auricles. In its course, the Blood performs a double circula- tion,—one called the Lesser^ the Pulmonary, or that through the Lungs,—the other called the Greater^ the Aortic or Systematic, or that through the rest of the Body. In the former, it passes from the Right Ventricle to the Lungs, and returns to the Left Auricle.—In^the latter, it goes from the Left Ventricle to the different parts of the Body, and returns to the Right Auricle. During this Circulation, the Auricles and Ventricles contract and dilate in succession, but the Auricles and Arteries, and the Ventricles and Veins, act in concert with each other. The Heart is the centre of the Vascular System, and the principal agent in the Circulation of the Blood. The right side of the Heart receives the Blood, which is contaminated in passing through the Body, and sends it to the Lungs, where it is purified through the medium of the Air. From the Lungs the Blood, now purified, is returned to the left side of the Heart, to be circulated through all the other parts of the Body, thereby imparting nou- rishment, growth, and strength, to the general System; being found also to be the source of Sensibility, Irrita- bility, Motion, and Animal Heat. The Circulation of the Blood is demonstrated by throwing a Ligature round an Artery and its corre-

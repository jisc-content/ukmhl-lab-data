Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 177 where it joins the Sinus Venosus, is the Valve o/'Eus- TACHius, which is formed by the inner Coats of the Cava and Sinus. The Valve is in the shape of a crescent, with the con- vex edge fixed to the union of the Sinus and Cava, and the concave edge turned obliquely upwards, and reach- ing about half way over the Mouth of the Cava. Its size and appearance, however, vary much in different subjects, being sometimes half an inch in breadth, at other times scarcely a vestige of it is to be seen. Its posterior Cornu is continued with the left side of the Isthmus of the Fossa Ovalis, the other end vanishes in the right side of the Sinus. It is equally distinct in an Adult as in a Foetus; but in the former it is frequently found reticulated, or Cribriform, which appearance is seldom, though {iome- times, met with in the latter. In a recent case, the Author found this Valve perfectly Cribriform in a child that died a few hours after Birth. In an Adult, it is supposed to prevent the Blood of the Auricle from passing into the inferior Cava; and in a Foetus, to direct the Blood of the Inferior Cava to the Foramen Ovale. Upon the left side of the Valve of Eustaciiius, in the under and back part of the Auricle^ is the Orifice or Termination of the Coronary Vein of the Heart. Over and towards the right side of the Orifice of this Vein, there is a semilunar Valve to prevent the Blood in the Auricle from passing into the Vein. This, like the Eustachian Valve, varies much in appearance. The inner side of the proper Auricle is readily distin- guished from the Sinus, by having a number of Fleshy VOL. II. M

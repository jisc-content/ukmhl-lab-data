Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 175 between the Auricle and Ventricle, the other between the Ventricle and Artery. At the right side of the Heart are two Veins, called from their large size VencB Cavce; the one Superior, the other Inferior, The Superior Vena Cava, called also Vena Cava De- scendens, conveys the Blood from the upper part of the Body; and the Irvferior Vena Cava, termed likewise A- scendens, conveys it from the lower parts; and both ter- minate in the Right Auricle; the Superior Cava enter- ing at the fore, upper, and right side, and the Inferior Cava at the back, under, and right side of that Cavity. The Blood in the Auricle is prevented from returning by the fulness of the Veins, and by the pressure of the Blood a tergo. The Auricle is situated upon the right, and partly upon the back part of the Heart. It is somewhat of an oval form, and is divided into the Right Sinus Ve- nosus, md Projper Auricle* jl The Sinus Venosus, vel Sinus Venarum Cavarum, is formed by the union of the two Venae Cavae, which swell out towards the anterior and left side. It is notch- ed at its anterior edge, is thin when compared with the corresponding Ventricle, being only about the eighth part of an inch in thickness ; but is a Muscular Bag of considerable strength, and, both upon its outer and inner Surface, is uniform and smooth. At the upper and left side of the Sinus, and to the left of the Superior Cava, is the projection or Appen- dix, termed, from its supposed resemblance to the Ear of a Quadruped, Proper Auricle. It is formed by a blind Sac, which is serrated and notched on its poste-

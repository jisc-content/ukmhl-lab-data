150 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. in general, a broad Ligament ascends, to fix it to the under part of the Os Hyoides. From the posterior Corners four Processes project, called Cornua, two of which, termed AS'wpmor, are long, and ascend to be joined by round Ligaments to the ex- tremities of the Cornua of the Os Hyoides. In the middle of these Ligaments, one or two small Cartilaginous, or sometimes Osseous Substances, of an oval form, are frequently found. The other two Cornua, called Inferior, are shorter than the Superior, and curved backwards, to be fixed by smooth articulating Surfaces to the side of the Cri- coid Cartilage. The Thyroid Cartilage serves for the protection of the other Cartilages, for the attachment of the Vocal Ligaments, and, along with the Os Hyoides, preserves the passage open, for the transmission of Food to the Stomach. In old age, this Cartilage is frequently ossified. The Cricoid, Annular, or Ring-like Cartilage, is placed below, and also behind the Thyroid, and, like it, may be readily felt in the fore part of the Throat. It is narrow before, where it lies under the Thyroid Cartilage, and thick, broad, and strong posteriorly, where it is placed behind that Cartilage. The back part of this Cartilage is divided by a lon- gitudinal Ridge into two Lateral Depressions, for the reception of the Posterior Crico-arytenoid Muscle. Its under edge is horizontal, and fixed to the whole ?;ircumference of the beginning of the Trachea. The upper edge slants considerably, or rises between

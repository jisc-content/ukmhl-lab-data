840 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Pelvis of a Foetus is commonly so small, that the principal parts of the Viscera afterwards lodged in it, are at this time contained in the Cavity of the Ab- domen. The longest diameter of the Pelvis is be- tween the Ossa Pubis and Sacrum. The Bladder of Urine is of a long form, and extends almost to the Umbilicus. The greater part of it is above the Pelvis, and is more particularly covered by the Peritoneum than in an Adult. The Urethra arises more directly from the lower extremity of the Blad- der than in a full-grown person. The Muscular Coat of the Bladder is proportional- ly a little thicker and more irritable than in an Adult, in consequence of which the Urine is voided more fre- quently, and with greater velocity, in a Child. The Urachus, which is of a Conical Jhrm and Fi- brous texture, ascends from the bottom of the Bladder, between the Umbilical Arteries, and between the Pe- ritoneum and Linea Alba, to the Umbilicus, and va- nishes by degrees in the Umbilical Cord. It is formed by a production of the Fundus Vesicae, and in a Human Body is a solid Substance, consti- tuting a Suspensory Ligament of the Bladder. It has been sometimes found hollow at its beginning, and has b.een said to be so, in one or two instances, throughout its whole length. In a Foetal Quadruped, it is a large Tube, which transmits Urine from the Bladder to a Bag called Ah lantois, placed between the Amnios and Chorion. The common Iliac Arteries divide, on each side, in- to a small External, and large Internal Branch, in con- sequence of which, the lower Extremities are less in proportion than in an Adult.

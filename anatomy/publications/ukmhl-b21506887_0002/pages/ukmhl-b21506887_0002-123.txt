Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 89 It is lined by a Membrane similar to that of the Nose, of which it appears to be a continuation; and which, on the edge of the Mouth of the Tube, is so thick as to add considerably to its prominency. The Eustachian Tube preserves the balance of Air between the outer and inner Ear, and prevents it from pressing too forcibly upon the different Mem*- branes placed in the sides of the Tympanum. It has been supposed to convey the sound of a Per- son's own Voice to the inner Ear; but Experiment does not favour this opinion, nor is it found to render Sound more distinct when the Mouth is open;â€”though Per- sons who have a degree of deafness are observed fre- quently to listen after this manner. The Cells of the Mastoid Process, which open into the upper and back part of the Tympanum opposite to, but a little higher than, the Eustachian Tube. They contain Air, and are very irregular, varying in number and size in different Persons, having many wind- ings and turnings, which communicate with each other, and are lined, like the Cells of other Bones, by the Pe- riosteum Internum. Sometimes, instead of Cells, the Mastoid Process contains one large Cavity, which com- municates with the Tympanum in the common way. They assist the Tympanum in reflecting Sound, in increasing its strength, and conveying it to the Laby- rinth. In many of the Digitated Mammiferous Quadrupeds, there are large Cavities, connected with the Tympa- num, which seem to supply the place of Mastoid Cells. Above the Promontory, a Hole called Fenestra Ova- Its, the upper and under edges of which are convex

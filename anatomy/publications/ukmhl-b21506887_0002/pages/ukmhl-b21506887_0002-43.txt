Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. SI lis of the Optic Thalami. This is stretched across like a Bridge, and is best seen when the Thalami are a little separated. The posterior parts of the Thalami turn downwards and outwards, after which they are elongated, to form the two white Cords, termed Tractus Optici. In the Groove between the Corpora Striata and Tha- lami, there is a Medullary Band, called Centrum Semi- circidare Geminum o/* Vieussens, or Tcenia Semicircu- laris o/'Halleti, or simply Plexus^ which is connected at its fore part with the anterior Crus of the Fornix, Over the Thalami is placed the Choroid Plexus, named from its being composed of a Chorus of Vessels and Membranes. It is a fine Vascular Web, consisting of small ramifications of Arteries and Veins, connected by the Pia Mater, and spread upon the Surface of the Thalami, and some of the adjacent parts; processes of it descending behind, and covering the upper portion of the Pedes Hippocampi. The Veins of each Choroid Plexus form a Trunk termed Vena Galeni, and the two Venae Galeni unite together, and terminate in the Torcular Herophili. The Choroid Plexus frequently contains numerous round Globules, resembling Hydatids, which have been considered by some Authors as Lymphatic Glands. Under the Raphe of the Corpus Callosum, is placed the Septum Lucidum, which is of considerable thickness below, but becomes thinner towards its middle and upper part. When viewed laterally, it is observed to be broad before, curved at its edges, and to become gradually narrower towards its posterior extremity. It is connected above with the Corpus Callosum, be-

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 189 the left side of that Organ, and communicating with the Branches of the other Artery on its upper and un- der Surfaces. The Coronary Arteries run under the Serous Mem- brane, and are entirely dispersed upon the Substance of the Heart, and upon the roots of the great Vessels, forming upon these some of the minute Branches, term- ed Vasa Vasorum, The Coronary Arteries, from their situation opposite to the Valves, have been supposed to be filled at a diffe- rent time from that of the rest of the Arterious System; â€”but from Experiment, it seems now sufficiently ascer- tained, that the Coronary Vessels have their Pulsation at the same instant with the other Arteries. The Coronary Veins return the Blood from their cor- responding Arteries. The principal part of them join into a Trunk, called the Great Coronary Fein, which is short, but about the third of an inch in diameter. This, after making a turn from the left side, and run- ning between the Left Auricle and Ventricle, termi- nates in the under and back part of the Right Auricle, and is there covered by its Valve. Other Coronary Veins, much smaller than the for- mer, terminate in different parts of the right side of the Heart. Besides the termination of the Coronary Vessels, as mentioned above, some have taken notice of Branches of these, both Arteries and Veins, as terminating di- rectly in the Cavity of the right side of the Heart, by minute Orifices, which have been termed, after their original describer, Fo^-amina Thkbesii ; but penetrat-

S66 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt IV. some of the Papillae being occasionally incorporated with each other. Upon the Points of the Papillae are the Terminal tions of the Uriniferous Tubes,—^large enough to be distinguished by the naked Eye,—through which the Urine distils from the Substance of the Kidney. Round the root of each Papilla, a Membranous Tube arises, termed Infundihulum or Calixy which receives the Urine from the Papilla. The Infmidibula are commonly the same in number with the Papillae ; the number, however, varying in different Subjects, two or more of the Papillae some- times opening into the same Infundihulum. The Infundibula join into two or three large Trunks, at the Sinus of the Kidney, which afterwards form a Dilatation of considerable size, of the shape of an. in- verted Cone, and termed Pelvis of the Kidney. The Pelvis is placed between the principal Branches of the Renal Artery and Vein, partly within, but the greater part of it without the Body of the Kidney, and contracts into a long Tube, about the size of a Goose- quill, called Ureter, Ueeters. The Ureters are commonly one to each Kidney, though in some rare instances they are double on one or on both sides. The Artery of the Kidney is placed uppermost,—the Vein in the middle and fore part,—and the continua- tion of the Pelvis and beginning of the Ureter at the under and back part of the Blood-vessels ; which dis- position of the Vessels serves as a distinguishing mark

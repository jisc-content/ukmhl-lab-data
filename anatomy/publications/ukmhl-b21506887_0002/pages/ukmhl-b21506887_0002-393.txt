Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. S17 insertion of the Umbilical Cord, and is termed Vesicula Umbiliealis, vel Alba. The Vesicula Umbilicalis is connected to the Cord by a Filament consisting of an Artery and Vein, derived from the Umbilical Vessels, which, with the Fluid and Bag, soon disappear. The use of this Vesicle, which has sometimes heen mistaken for an AllantoiSy is not yet understood. In early Gestation the Ovum is large in proportion to the Embryo ; but towards the latter period of Preg- nancy, the proportion is reversed, as appears from the following observations. No well-authenticated account has been yet received of the Embryo being observable till near the end of the third Week, when it is found to be about a line in length, and to appear like an oblong curved Vesicle floating in the Limpid Liquor of the Ovum. In the fourth Week, the Ovum is about the size of a Pigeon's Egg, and the Embryo not larger than a common House-Fly. At the end of the sixth Week, the Embryo is about as large as a Honey-Bee, with the Head turned for- wards towards the farther extremity of the Trunk. The size of the Head, at this time, is almost equal to that of the rest of the Body. The Eyes and Mouth appear evident. In the eighth Week, the Ovum nearly equals the bulk of a Hen's Egg, and the Embryo is about an inch in length. The Nose and Ears now begin to be visible; the Limbs extend beyond the Trunk. The cord is at thi^ period almost as long as the Embryo, but the Ves-

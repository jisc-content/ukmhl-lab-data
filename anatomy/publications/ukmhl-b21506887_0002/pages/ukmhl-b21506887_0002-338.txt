262 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. part of the Spleen, and behind the left portions of the Stomach, Pancreas, and Colon. The Kidney is between four and five inches in length, but considerably less from the outer to the in- ner side, and less still from before backwards ; or, it is compared in shape to a French or Kidney Bean, It is rounded anteriorly, flattened posteriorly, con- vex and uniform in its outer margin, and has a deep Depression or Sinus towards the Vertebrae, surrounded with unequal edges, where the Renal Vessels and Nerves enter, It is a little broader behind than before, and a little broader and more curved above than below ; from which circumstances, but more particularly from the disposition of the Vessels, to be afterwards mentioned, it is easy to distinguish the Right from the Left Kid- ney when taken out of the Body. The Right Kidney is connected to the Liver and Duodenum, the Left to the Spleen, and both to the Muscles on which they are placed, and to the Renal Glands and Colon, by Cellular Substance, and by the Peritoneum ; which last, reflected from the Liver and Spleen to the Kidneys, have by some been called the Ligaments of the Kidneys, They are also connected to the Aorta and Vena Cava by their Blood-vessels, and to the Bladder of Urine by the Ureters.â€”They accompany the motion of the Liver and Spleen in the diff'erent states of Respiration. Each Kidney is surrounded by loose Cellular Sub- stance, which commonly contains a considerable quan- tity of Fat, and has therefore got the name of Tunica Adiposa,

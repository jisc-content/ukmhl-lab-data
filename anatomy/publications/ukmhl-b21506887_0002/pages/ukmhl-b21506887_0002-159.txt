Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, kc. 117 On the Dorsum or Upper Surface, there is a Lmea Mediana, or middle Groove, running longitudinally, and divided into two lateral Convexities. The inferior Surface, which reaches only from the middle of the Tongue to the point, is connected to the parts below it by the Sublingual Ligament, or Free- 7mm Linguce, which is a Doubling of the Skin or Lin- ing of the Mouth. The sides of the Tongue are fixed to the Lower Jaw, and to the Styloid Processes and parts adjacent, by Membranous Ligaments. The Tongue is chiefly composed of the Fibres of the Muscles, which serve for its motions.—These Fibres are disposed in various directions, and intermixed with Medullary Fat. The upper and lateral parts of the Tongue are com- posed of the Stylo-glossi.—Its middle portion, between the two former Muscles, is formed of the Linguales.— The lower part is chiefly formed of the Genio-glossi; and behind, the Stylo-glossi enter into its composi- tion. The Tongue is covered by a continuation of the Com- mon Integuments, which are preserved soft and moist by the Saliva. The Cuticle of the Tongue forms Vaginas for receiv- ing the Substances called Papillw, and is here so re- markably thin, as to be properly adapted to the office these Bodies have to perform. The Corpus Mucosum of the Tongue is thicker than in other parts of the Body, but more moist. The third Covering of the Tongue, the Cutis Vera, is plentifully supplied with Nerves.—The Papillae,

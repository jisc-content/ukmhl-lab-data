70 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. ViTEEous Humour. The Vitreous Humour is situated in the back part of the Cavity of the Eye, which it occupies from the insertion of the Optic Nerve to the Surface of the Crys- talline Lens. It is round at the back part and sides, where it is covered by the Retina ; but is concave before, where it forms a bed for the Lens. It is by much the largest of the three Humours, oc- cupying upwards of nine-tenths of the whole Eye, and has a Gelatinous appearance,—or somewhat like the Glaire of an Egg. In an Adult, it is always very transparent; and in an Old Person, it does not, like the Lens, degenerate into a yellow, or any other colour. In a Foetus, like the Aqueous Humour, it is of a reddish tint. The liquor of which the Vitreous Humour is com- posed, is similar to the Aqueous,—^very fluid, tran- spires readily through the Capsule, though that Coat be entire, and, like the Aqueous Humour, is some- what thicker, heavier, and more viscid than Water. VV^hen this Humour is evacuated by puncture, in the living Body, it is very seldom, though sometimes, re- newed. Upon the Surface of this Humour there is a Coat, termed Vitrea, vel Hyaloidea, from its resemblance to Glass, as transparent as the Humour itself, and so thin and Cobweb-like, as to have also the name of Aranea. The Tunica Vitrea is remarkably smooth on its outer

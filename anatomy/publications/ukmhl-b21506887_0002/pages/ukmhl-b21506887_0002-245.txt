Part IV.J OF THE VISCERA, &e. diastinum, and which have no communication, except through the medium of the Trachea, in consequence of which Respiration is sometimes continued for a consi- derable time, where one of the Lungs is almost entirely consumed. Each of the Lungs is again divided by Fissures, varying in depth in different Bodies, into large Por- tions, called Lohes, which facilitates their motion, and the dilatation of their Cells. Of the Lobes, three belong to the Right Lung, corre- sponding with the larger Bag of the Pleura, and two to the Left, between which there is a Notch or Sinus, oc- cupied by the point of the Heart. Sometimes an addi* tional Lobe is found in the Left Lung, or the reverse in the Right one ; but mistakes may arise in numbering these, in consequence of morbid adhesions. Each of the Lobes is subdivided into many smaller parts, termed Z/o6wZ^,y, which are of different sizes, and of an irregular angular form. The Lobules are also subdivided, and they degene- rate at last into small Vesicles or CellSj which constitute a large share of the Lungs. The Cells of the Lungs are purely Membranous, of an irregular figure, but all nearly of the same size, compressed and closely connected, and have a free communication with each other. Between the different Lobes, Lobules, and Cells, a large quantity of common Cellular Substance, desti- tute of Fat, is interposed, which unites and strengthens them, and allows the Blood-vessels to be minutely dis- persed over them. The Ceils of the Lungs have no communication with

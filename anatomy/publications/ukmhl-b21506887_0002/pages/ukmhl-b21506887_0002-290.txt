210 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. OF THE LIFER. The Liver is the largest of the Conglomerate Glands, and its weight nearly equal to that of the Brain. It forms a solid Mass, of a dusky red or brown colour, situated immediately under the Diaphragm, extending downwards to the Margin of the Thorax, but in the sound state not going beyond it. It is placed partly in the Right Hypochondrium, which it in a great measure fills, and partly in the Epi- gastrium, reaching over a little way into the Left Hy- pochondrium. It is convex and very smooth on the upper Surface, where it is opposed to the Diaphragm, though a little flattened on the upper part of its left side, where it is opposed to the Heart. It is irregularly concave on the under side, where it rests upon the Stomach and Intestines, and is perfo- rated by several large Blood-vessels.

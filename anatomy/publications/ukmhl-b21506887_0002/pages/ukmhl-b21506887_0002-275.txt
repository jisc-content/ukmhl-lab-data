Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 225 also it is closely connected. Here it is sometimes call- ed Colon Sinistrum. In the left Iliac Region it forms two Convolutions, compared in shape to the Greek letter 5, and hence called Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon, which afterwards constitutes the Rectum. The Sigmoid Flexure varies considerably in length in different Persons, extending frequently into the Hy- pogastric Region, and in some instances as far as the Intestinum Caecum. The Colon, through its whole extent, is fixed to the Body by means of the Meso-colon. The Rectum^ which has its name from its being a« mong the straightest of the Intestines, begins at the last Lumbar Vertebra, descends upon the fore side of the Os Sacrum and Os Coccygis, and terminates in tlie Anus, a little beyond the extremity of the last- named Bone. . In its course it follows the direction of the Bones over which it passes ; turning first downwards, then a little backwards, next forwards, and is fixed to them by the Meso-rectum. The Rectum differs from the other Intestines, in be- coming wider in its progress downwards, and forming below a Reservoir for the Faeces. At the Anus, it contracts into a narrow Orifice, the sides of which are disposed in close longitudinal Folds. Upon the Outer Surface of the great Intestines, but more especially upon the Colon, are the AppendiculcB Pinguedinosce^ situated at different distances from each other,—thin at their roots, becoming thicker in their VOL.

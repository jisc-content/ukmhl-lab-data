2U COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY, [Part IV. the Under towards the Intestines ;—but when the Ab- domen is laid open, unless the Stomach be considerably distended, it falls back against the Spine, so that the superior Surface becomes anterior, and the inferior Surface posterior. In the empty state of the Stomach, its opposite sides, internally, are in contact; but they gradually recede from each other in proportion as it becomes distended. The Large Curvature is turned obliquely forwards and downwards towards the Abdominal Muscles, and extends from one Orifice to the other. The Small Curvature is opposed to the large one, and turned backwards and upwards, towards the Spine, extending also between the two Orifices. The Orifices are next the Small Curvature. The Left is termed Cardia, Os Ventriculi, or Upper Orifice of the Stomach.—It is placed at the right side of the great extremity, and is opposed to the Spine, but at a little distance from it, and is formed by the termination of the Esophagus.—It allows a free passage for the Food into the Stomach, the return of which is pre- vented by the Angle formed between the Stomach and Esophagus, by the Fleshy parts of the Cardia, and by the Fleshy Crura of the Diaphragm, between which the Cardia is situated. The Right or h%ferior Orifice^ commonly termed Py- lorus^ is situated under the small Lobe of the Liver, a little to the Right side of the Spine,—is turned more forwards than the Cardia, and is considerably lower than it, but rises in proportion to the distension of the Stomach. The Stomach is connected by the Cardia to the Eso-

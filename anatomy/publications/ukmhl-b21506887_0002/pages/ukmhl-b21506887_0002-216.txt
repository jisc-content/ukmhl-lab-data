168 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IY. the Sternum, and behind to the Pericardium and large Vessels of the Heart. The two Layers of the Anterior Mediastinum are closely applied to each other, excepting at the upper part of the Thorax, where they are separated by the remains of the Thymus Gland, At the upper part of the Thorax, it lies exactly be- hind the middle of the Sternum; but, in its descent, it inclines gradually to the left edge of that Bone, so as to divide the Thorax unequally. In consequence of its obliquity, a pointed instrument, pushed through the centre of the Sternum, is generally found to pass into the right Cavity of the Thorax. Frequent deviations, however, from this general rule, have been met with.—In particular, Lieutaud and Sabatieb relate several instances where the Anterior Mediastinum was found to descend along the middle of the Sternum ; and others, though rare, where it de- scended even to the right side of this Bone. The Posterior Mediastinum reaches from the root of the Lungs and back part of the Heart, to the Dorsal Vertebras. Between the Layers of the Posterior Mediastinum,, a Triangular Space is formed, in which are situated the under end of the Trachea, the Esophagus, the Aorta Descendens, the Vena Azygos, the Thoracic Duct, with some Lymphatic Glands, and the Eighth Pair of Nerves. The Blood-vessels of the Mediastinum are from those of the neighbouring parts:—The Anterior Mediastinum is supplied by Branches from the Subclavian, Internal Mammaries, and Diaphragmatics,—and the Posterior

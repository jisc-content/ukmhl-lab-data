Part IV.] OF THE VISCJERA, &c. 115 the Facial, Temporal, and Internal Maxillaries, which are derived from the external Carotids. The Veins go chiefly to the External, and partly to the Internal Jugulars. The Nerves come from the first and second Branches of the Fifth Pair, and also from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Palate^ or Roof of the Mouth, is divided into the Palatum Durum and Palatum Molle. The former is composed of the Palate-Plates of the Superior Maxil- lary and Palate Bones, and is covered by the Perios- teum and common Membrane of the Mouth, which pre- vent the Bones from being injured. The Membrane which covers the Bones of the Palate is remarkably thick, and is marked by a middle longi- tudinal Line, and numerous transverse Rugce, which assist in the division of the Food. It is nearly of the same structure with that of the Gums, but perforated by the Ducts of the Palatine Glands, for the excretion of Mucus, which serves to lu- bricate the Palate, and assists in dissolving the Food. The Palatum Molle, Velum Pendulum Palati, or Soft Palate, is that part which projects from the posterior edge of the Ossa Palati, and from the Pterygoid Pro- cesses of the Sphenoid Bone, over the root of the Tongue, and forms a Musculo-Membranous Partition suspended between the Nose and Mouth. It is composed of the Membranes which line the Nose and Mouth, and of the Expansions of the Circumflexi and Levatores Palati, and likev/ise of numerous Mu- cous Glands, which serve to lubricate the Mauth and Throat, and facilitate Deglutition.

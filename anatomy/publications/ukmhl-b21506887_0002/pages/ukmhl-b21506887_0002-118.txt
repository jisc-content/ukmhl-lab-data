84 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Insertion: Into the tip of the Antitragus, asi far as the inferior part of the Antihelix, where there is a Fis- sure in the Cartilage, Action: To turn the tip of the Antitragus a little outwards, and depress the extremity of the Antihelix. Transversus Auris, vel Transversus Auriculce. Origin: From the prominent part of the Concha, on the back of the Ear. Insertion : Into the outside of the Antihelix. Action: To draw the parts to which it is connected towards each^ other, and to stretch the Scapha and Concha. The Cartilage of the External Ear is connected to the Temporal Bone by the common Integuments, and by its Muscles; and is furnished with Ligamentous Membranes, which fix it to the roots of the Zygoma and Mastoid Process. The Auricle collects sound, and conveys it to the Meatus Externus,â€”the Muscles giving tension to it, so as to render the sound more distinct. The Meatus Auditorius Externus leads inwards from the Concha, and in its course proceeds somewhat for- wards and upwards, turning a little downwards at its farthest extremity, and terminating at the Membrana Tympani. The turns, however, are so inconsiderable, that the bottom of the passage may be readily seen in a clear light, on pulling the Ear backwards. It is rather of an oval form, a little contracted in the

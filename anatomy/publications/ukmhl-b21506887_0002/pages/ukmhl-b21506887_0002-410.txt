It is a very vascular Substance, and separates the two Cameras from each other. According to Blumen- BACH, it keeps the Iris expanded during the rapid in- crease of the Ball of the Eye. The Crystalline Lens is almost Spherical, and has numerous Vessels dispersed upon its Capsule.

The Meatus Externus, and Membrana Tympani, are lined by a Mucous Membrane, which is cast off af- ter Birth. The Mammas of a Foetus in both Sexes are in the form of Tubercles, from which a Fluid contained in them may be readily squeezed out. The Thymus Gland, in a Foetus, is a large Sub-

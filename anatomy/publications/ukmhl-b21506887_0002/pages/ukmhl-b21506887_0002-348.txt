272 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. extracted from the Bladder, without penetrating into the Cavity of the Abdomen, or wounding the Perito- neum. The Second Coat is termed Muscular.—It is com- posed of distinct Fleshy Fibres, though of a pale co- lour, interwoven with each other, and formed into Fasciculi. The External Fibres run chiefly in a longitudinal direction, and are connected, at the under and fore part of the Bladder, with the Ossa Pubis, The internal Fibres run in all directions, many of them appearing like flat Bands, which are inter- mixed with each other in the form of an irregvilar net- work. The Muscular Fibres are contracted about the Neck of the Bladder, and form what has been termed Sphincter Vesicce;—these, however, are merely the continuation of the other Fibres. The Muscular Coat, by its contraction, occasions the complete evacuation of the Bladder.—The Fibres about the Neck of the Bladder, by acting separately from the rest of the Muscular Coat, prevent the invo- luntary discharge of the Urine. The Cellular Substance under the Muscular Fibres is in considerable quantity, and is frequently termed Nervous Coat. The Inner Coat, often called Villous, is smooth like the inside of the Peritoneum, but is a real Mucous Membrane. It is thin, yet so dense as to prevent the exudation of the Urine. This Coat is rendered somewhat unequal by the pro- jection of the Fasciculi of the Muscular Fibres ; and

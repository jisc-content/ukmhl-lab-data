Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Tt and enters deep between its Convolutions, is of a soft consistence, about the sixth part of an inch in thickness over the Convolutions, is evidently more Vascular than the Medullary part, as appears by minute Injections thrown into the extreme Branches ; but it is uniform5 and,^ in its natural state, without any appearance of a Fibrous Texture. The inner Substance, improperly termed Medullary^ is of a white colour, with a slight tinge of yellow, and is considered as giving origin to the different Nerves. It has been called by some Excretory^ from having been supposed to be formed of hollow Tubes continued from the Vessels of the Cortical part; but no Cavities have ever been observed in the soft Striae or fibrous-like mat- ter of which it is composed. A Section of this part of the Brain shews no appear- ance of Cells, or Globules, or Fibres, but is smooth and uniform when divided by a sharp instrument, and exhibits many red points, which are the cut extremities of Blood- vessels, with the Blood oozing from them. The number of these points varies according to the quantity of Blood remaining in the Brain. The vessels from which the blood issues here, are seldom larger than Hog''s Bristles. A thin slice of it spread on a Glass, and viewed by a microscope, has been found to resemble a kind of pulp, consisting of Globules greatly inferior in size to the Globules of Blood. The Medullary Substance is greater in quantity, more opake, and somewhat firmer in texture, than the Cine- rit ious Substance, with which it is so intimately con- nected, as to appear to be a continuation of it.â€”Streaks are observed in many parts of the Medullary Matter,

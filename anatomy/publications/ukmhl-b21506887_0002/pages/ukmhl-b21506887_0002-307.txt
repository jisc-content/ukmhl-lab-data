Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 257 PANCREAS. The Pancreas is a Gland of the Conglomerate kind, from six to eight inches in length, an inch and a half in breadth; is flattened at its anterior and posterior parts, and is of the same nature with the Salivary Glands, of which it may be reckoned the largest. It is situated in the Epigastric Region, and is placed transversely in the back part of the Abdomen, between the Stomach and Spine. It has a large or Right Extremity, and a small or Left one, an Anterior and a Posterior Surface, and an Upper and Under Edge. The Right Extremity is attached to the left side of the second turn of the Duodenum, or to that part where the Intestine is about to go across the Spine. From the under part of the Right Extremity, the Pancreas sends down an Elongation or Process, which adheres closely to the Duodenum. This Process was discovered by Winslow, and term- ed by him Pancreas Minus.â€”It is also called Head of the Pancreas. The Pancreas passes before the upper edge of the transverse portion of the Duodenum, and over the Aorta, Vena Cava, and part of the Splenic Vessels, to all of which it is attached. It becomes gradually narrower and thinner towards its Left Extremity, which is rounded, and is fixed to the Spleen, through the medium of the Large Omen- tum. VOL. II. R

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 137 That part of the Pulp has the most Vascular appear- ance which is covered by Bone; but the Osseous Shell is found to adhere so slightly to the Pulp, as to be separated from it without apparent laceration. The Osseous Matter is formed in Strata, one Layer being added within another, till the Tooth is com- pleted. After the Osseous Substance is formed, the Enamel is added, which increases in thickness, till within a little while of the time at which the Tooth begins to pass through the Gum. The Enamel is secreted by the Capsule which con- tains the Pulp, soon after the Osseous Shell has begun to be formed. It is always thickest where first depo- sited ; of course, it is thicker upon the Body than ,upon the Cervix. The Enamel is secreted in the form of a pure white earthy Substance, moistened with a Mucilage, and has much the appearance of crystallization. The deposition of the Enamel continues nearly as long as the Teeth are contained in their Capsules. It is at first, and even for some time after Birth, so soft, as to be little firmer than Chalk, being easily scraped by the Nail, but soon acquiring a flinty hardness and a striated appearance. After the Bodies of the Teeth have attained their full size, no addition of Substance is made to the Ena- mel, the Membrane which produces it being destroyed previous to the appearance of the Teeth beyond the Gums. The Osseous part, on the contrary, continues to grow for a considerable time afterwards, one third

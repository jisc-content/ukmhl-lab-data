They occupy a large part of the Abdomen, and are connected to the Body through their whole extent, by a Doubling of the Peritoneum. On account of the inequalities of their size, they are divided into Small and Large Intestines, and each of these again have their subdivisions. Small Intestines. The Small Intestines are smooth on their outer Sur- face, and of a tapering form, becoming gradually less in their diameter from their upper to their under ex- tremity, and are divided into the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ilium. The Duodenum begins at the Pylorus, and makes a short turn upwards and backwards, by the Neck of the Gall Bladder, to which it is contiguous; having the Anterior Layer of the Omentum fixed to its inferior part, and the Omentum Minus to its opposite side. It then passes obliquely downwards and to the right side, before the Great Vessels which go into the Liver, and likewise before the Renal Artery and Vein; the Gut being here included in the Cellular Substance of the Meso-colon. Opposite to the under part of the right Kidney, it makes a turn to the left side, and is now lodged in the common root of the Meso-colon and Mesentery, receiv- ing into its back part the ends of the Biliary and Pan- creatic Ducts, and at the upper part of the Lumbar

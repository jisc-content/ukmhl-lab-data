Â£80 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. part, however, the Process is so incorporated with the common Cellular Substance of the Cord, as to appear to form part of it. On the outside of the Cremaster, part of the Superficial Fascia, formerly described, is found, and which is sometimes termed Camper's Fascia, The under part of the Vagina of the Cord is sepa- rated by a Partition formed by the upper end of the Vaginal Coat of the Testicle, and by condensed Cellu- lar Substance, so that no Liquor can easily pass from the Cord to the Testicle, or vice versa. The Arteries of the Testes termed Arterice Sperma- ticcB and Arterice Prejparantes^ arise, one on each side, from the fore part of the Aorta, a little below the Re- nal Arteries, opposite to, but at a little distance from, each other. The Spermatic Artery crosses over the Psoas Mus- cles and Ureter, and descends near the Brim of the Pelvis, behind the Peritoneum, to the under part of the Abdomen. At the lower part of the Abdomen, it gets into the Superior Abdominal Ring, under the edge of the Ob- liquus Internus and Transversalis, then perforates the Ring of the Obliquus Externus, and passes in the Spermatic Cord to the Testicle. In its descent it gives Branches to the adjacent parts, and is so interlaced with the corresponding Veins, as to have been supposed by the Ancients to have large lateral communications with them. After passing out of the Ring, it divides into Branches which go to the Testis at its posterior edge. They are partly dispersed upon the Epididymis, but the larger Branches run in a serpentine direction into the Sub-

328 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, Uterus,â€”and, in the Substance of the Placenta, an appearance which has been supposed by many Authors to be common Cellular Membrane, of a tender nature, and easily ruptured by Injection, but which is consider- ed by late Writersas a regular Spongy Substance, simi- lar to that in the Body of the Penis, and, as in that Or- gan, the Cells communicating freely with each other. The Placenta is connected to the Uterus on one side by Blood-vessels and by the Decidua, and to the Foetus on the other, by means of the Umbilical Cord. The common place of attachment is near the Fundus Uteri; though it is found at different times adhering to all the other parts of the Uterus, not even the Os Tincae excepted. In the case of Twins, there is sometimes only one, but most frequently two distinct Placentse, adhering together by the intervention of a Membrane in which the Vessels of the two Placentas occasionally communi- cate with each other. There are in this case also two distinct sets of Mem- branes, which form two Apartments, separated by a Partition ; each Apartment containing its own Foetus, Waters, and Cord. The Placenta receives Blood from the Uterus for the nourishment of the Foetus, and, according to the opi- nion of modern Anatomists, purifies the Blood, in the same manner as the Lungs do in the Adult. In proof of which it is observed, that the Blood passing through the Umbilical Vein to the Child is of a pure Vermilion Colour, while that returning by the Arteries to the Placenta is purple, and has all the other qualities of Venous Blood.

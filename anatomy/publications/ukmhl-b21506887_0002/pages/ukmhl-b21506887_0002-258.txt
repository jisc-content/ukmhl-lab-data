It is bounded above by the Diaphragm, and the Bones to which that Muscle is fixed ; below, by the Pelvis; behind, by the Lumbar Vertebras and Muscles of the Loins ; anteriorly, by its proper Muscles ; and laterally, by the False Ribs, Ossa Ilii, and Muscles connected with these;â€”all of which have been describ- ed in their places. It is divided into three Regions, termed Upper, Mid- dle, and Under Region; each of which is subdivided into three others. The Upper Region begins opposite to the Cartilago Ensiformis, at a small depression called Scrohicidus Cordis, and descends to about a hand-breadth from the Umbilicus, or to a line extending between the Car- tilages of the eighth pair of Ribs.

114 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PabtIV. more of it is found in the Cheeks ; and the intervening space between the Masseter and Buccinator is occupied by a large quantity of it, which, while it gives shape to the Face, forms a sort of cushion about the Mucous and Salivary Glands. The Membrane of the Mouth is covered by fine VUU ; but these are most conspicuous upon the edges of the Lips, as may be distinctly seen after a minute Injection, or after macerating the parts till the Cuticle can be separated. From the edges of the Lips, the common Integu- ments, now become extremely thin, are converted into the Membrane which lines the Mouth, and which, op- posite to the Dentes Incisores of the upper and under Jaws, forms two Doublings or FrcBna, which fix the Lips more firmly to the Jaws. The Lips are serviceable in the general purposes of Speaking, Eating, Drinking, &c. The Gums cover the sides of the Alveolar Border of both Jaws, pass in between the different Teeth, and surround and adhere firmly to the Collar of each. The Substance of the Gums is of a dense nature, and very Vascular, from which they derive their floricj appearance, and the Vessels are united by a compact Cellular Texture. They may be said to consist of the Common Mem- brane of the Mouth and the Periosteum of the Ja^^s, intimately connected. They serve as a Covering to the Jaws, and contri- bute to the security of the Teeth. The Arteries of the Lips, Cheeks, and Gums, which are considerable both as to number and size, are from

Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 251 The whole of the Bile contained in the Gall-Bladder is found, by experiment, to pass from the Liver through the Hepatic Duct to the Ductus Communis, and from that by the Cystic Duct into the Gall-bladder, The Ductus Communis CJioledochus is about the size of a Goose-quill, and is considerably larger than either of the Ducts which open into it; and, like the Ductus Hepaticus, is much smoother internally than the Cystic Duct. It descends at the posterior and left side of the first portion of the Duodenum, and, getting behind the right extremity of the Pancreas, passes for some way obliquely between the Muscular and inner Coats of that Intestine. It terminates in the left, posterior, and nearly in the under part of the second turn of the Duodenum, by a projecting Orifice, which is rounded above, and point- ed below, and which, with the obliquity of the passage of the Duct, has the eff'ect of a Valve, in preventing the reflux of the Bile to the Liver or Gall-Bladder. The Structure of the Ductus Choledochus, and of the Biliary Ducts in general, is of the same nature, be- ing composed of an outer and inner Membrane. The inner Surfaces of the different Ducts also agree in being perforated by numberless Pores, which are the Mouths of Mucous Follicleg, similar to those upon the inside of the Gall-Bladder. The Ductus Communis, and Ducts which form it, are firm and strong ; but in cases where their termina- tions are obstructed, as by Gall Stones, by Tumours^ or by the want of a Gall-Bladder, they are sometimes observed greatly dilated.

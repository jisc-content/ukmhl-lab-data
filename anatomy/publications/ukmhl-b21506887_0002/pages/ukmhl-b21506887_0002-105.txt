Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 77 Eye, and assisting it in the expression of certain Pas- sions, have been called Rotafores, and Amatores. rESSÂ£:LS OF THE EYE. The Frontal, Facial, and Temporal Arteries, which are branches of the External and Internal Carotids, supply the Palpebrae, and communicate with those which are dispersed within the Orbit. Some small Branches of the Internal Maxillary Ar- tery pass through the Inferior Orbitar Fissure, to be dispersed chiefly upon the Periosteum of the Orbit and Fat of the Eye. The Ocular Artery, which is a Branch of the Inter- nal Carotid, passes through the Foramen Opticum in company with the Optic Nerve, and supplies the Fat, Muscles, and Ball of the Eye, and also the Lacrymal Gland and Tunica Conjunctiva. The Branches which belong to the Ball of the Eye, have th-e name of Ciliares. They perforate the Scle- rotica in different places, and are afterwards dispersed upon the Choroid Coat and Iris. One Branch of the Ocular Artery, called Centralis RetincB, perforates the Optic Nerve, and is dispersed upon the Retina. The Veins which correspond with the Arteries of the Eye, communicate freely with each other, and pass partly to the External Jugular Vein, by Branches si- tuated about the fore part of the Orbit, and partly to the internal Jugular Vein, by the Cavernous Sinus.

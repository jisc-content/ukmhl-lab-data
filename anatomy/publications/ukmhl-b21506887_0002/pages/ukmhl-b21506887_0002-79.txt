It is a lobulated Gland, or one of the Conglomerate kind. Is of a yellowish white colour, of an oblong form, and a little flattened. Has one end pointing to the Nose, the other to the external Angle of the Eye, and is fixed to the outer part of the Orbit by a small Ligament. Besides the Glandula Lacrymalis, there is a chain of smaller Glands, lying between it and the upper Eye- lid, and connecting them together. In the direction of the smaller Glands there are six or seven Excretory Ducts,—described by Dr Monro, 1758,—which run nearly parallel to, but do not com- municate with each other* The Excretory Ducts, on account of their smallness, are not often seen, and are injected with difficulty. They terminate on the inner side of the upper Eye-lid, near the outer Angle of the Eye and upper edge of the Tarsus.

Pari IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. the inferior Cava directly through the Passage termed Foramen Ovale to the Left Auricle. In the back part of the Septum, between the Right and Left Auricles, is the Foramen Ovale, nearly equal in size to the Mouth of the inferior Cava, bounded by a thick Muscular edge, termed Annulus Foraminis Ozalis. The Foramen Ovale is placed obliquely, and has a Membrane, forming a distinct Valve, somewhat of a Crescentic form, upon the left side of it, which allows part of the Blood of the Right Auricle to pass through this opening directly to the Left Auricle, but which completely prevents its return. The Blood going through the Foramen Ovale, as- sists in keeping up the balance of Circulatioii between the two sides of the Heart, till the Lungs are ready to receive it. The Pulmonary Artery divides into three Branches, the right and left of which run to the Lungs, while the middle one, called Ductus Arteriosus, larger than both the other Branches, and its Area nearly equal to that of the Foramen Ovale, passes in an oblique direction to the beginning of the descending Aorta. The Ductus or Canalis Arteriosus, forms nearly one half of the Aorta, carries part of the Blood of the Right Ventricle into that Artery, without allowing it to pass to the Lungs, and thereby assists the Foramen Ovale in keeping up the balance of Circulation till the Child has breathed; and the Aorta, formed in this manner, receives the force of both Ventricles, by which it is more enabled to drive the Blood through the Um- bilical Arteries to the Placenta.

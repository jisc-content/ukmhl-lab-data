Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. gOl they are now universally known to be entirely of the Lymphatic kind,â€”the Absorbents of the Lungs pass- ing through them in their way to the Thoracic Duct. The Trachea is furnished with Blood-vessels from the Inferior Laryngeals, and Nerves from the Recur- rents and Great Sympathetic Pair. The Trachea serves to convey Air into, and out from, the Cells of the Lungs, during Respiration, and to carry off the Perspirable Matter from the Arteries in the time of Expiration. The Blood-vessels of the Lungs consist of the Pul- monary and Bronchial Vessels ; the one for the general circulation, the other proper to the Lungs. The Pulmonary Blood-vessels have been already taken notice of in p. 182, 183. But here it may be proper to observe, that the Minute Branches of the Artery, running in the common Cellular Substance of the Lungs, form at last a Plexus upon the proper Cells, sometimes called Rete Miralnle, vel Rete Vasculosum Malpighi. Part of this Plexus terminates in the Cells, and their corresponding Bronchi, by Exhalent Vessels, from which that Halitus is derived which is expelled by the Lungs in Expiration. The Pulmonary Veins are commonly observed to be smaller, in proportion to the corresponding Arteries, than Veins are to Arteries in other parts of the Body, which has been supposed to be owing to the large quantity of Fluids expired. The Bronchial Arteries arise by three or four small Branches ; one of which is from an adjacent right Su- perior Intercostal, the rest from the Trunk of the Aorta. They are dispersed upon the Bronchi and Bronchial

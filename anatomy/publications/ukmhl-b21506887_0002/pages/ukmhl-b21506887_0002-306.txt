'256 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. potheses have been entertained with respect to the Use of this Organ. Many of the Ancients were of opinion,—that besides the Bile of the Liver, there was an Atra Bills, or Black Bile, Siwdi that the Spleen was the receptacle of it. Others have thought that a particular Menstruum was secreted in it, and conveyed to the Stomach for the purpose of Digestion. Others again,—that the Blood of the Spleen pro- motes the sluggish circulation of the Blood of the Vena Portae. The late Mr Hewson, who has written particularly on this Viscus, was of opinion, that it concurred with the Thymus and Lymphatic Glands in forming the red Globules of the Blood, and that these Globules were rendered complete in the Spleen. It has been also supposed,—that as the Stomach be- comes full, the Spleen is compressed by it, in conse- quence of which a greater quantity of Blood is sent to the Pancreas, for the secretion of the Pancreatic Juice. But the present most prevalent opinion is,—that the Blood undergoes some change in it, which renders it useful in the Secretion of the Bile, and this opinion is supported from the great quantity of Blood with which this Organ is known to be supplied, and from its Vein, not only in Man, but in other Animals, passing to the Vena Portae. A late opinion is, that the Spleen forms the oleaginous part of the Bile.

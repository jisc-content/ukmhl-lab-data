116 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. - The Palatum Molle conducts the Fluid of the Nose into the Mouth, and acts like asValve in preventing what we swallow from passing into the Nose. In the middle of the Posterior edge of the Velum Pa- lati, the Uvula or Pap of the Throat takes its Origin. It hangs pendulous from the Velum over the Base of the Tongue, and is peculiar to Man and the Ape tribe. It is of a Conical form, and is covered by the Mem- brane of the Mouth. Numerous Mucous Glands are found in its Substance, and it has a small Muscle with- in it, by which it is elevated and shortened ;â€”its other motions depending upon the Muscles of the Palate. The Use of the Uvula, in speaking and in degluti- tion, is evident from the inconveniences which result from its being destroyed by disease. The Arteries of the Palate, &c. come from the Fa- cial and Internal Maxillary. The Veins go to the External and Internal Jugulars. The Nerves are chiefly from the second of the Fifth, with some Twigs from the Eighth Pair. Tongue. The Tongue is of an oval Jhrm, and is divided into Base^ Bod/y^ and Apeoc. The Base, or posterior part of the Tongue, is sup- ported by, and connected to, the Os Hyoides, and, by the medium of this Bone, it is connected to the adja- cent Bones and Muscles. The Body, or middle part of the Tongue, terminates anteriorly in the loose moveable point.

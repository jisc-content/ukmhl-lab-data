Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. ^95 The Branches which the Penis receives from the Fe- moral Artery communicate with those of the Pudics, and are chiefly dispersed upon the Integuments. The Arteries of the Penis are divided into minute Ramifications, which communicate with each other, and with their fellows on the opposite side, and terminate partly in the corresponding Veins, and partly in the Cells of the Penis. The Feins arise, some from the extremities of the Arteries, and others by large open Mouths from the Cells of the Penis. The greater number of the Veins unite into a Trunk, called Fena Magna Penis, which runs in the superior Groove formed by the union of the Corpora Cavernosa, and is furnished with Valves, and with thick strong Coats. The Vena Magna, at the under end of the Symphy- sis Pubis, separates into Right and Left Plexus, which pass to the corresponding Iliac Veins. To an obstruction of the course of the Blood through the Veins, by a spasmodic contraction of the Veins themselves, and by the pressure of the Muscles at the root of the Penis, together with an increased influx through the Arteries, is owing that accumulation of Blood in the Corpora Cavernosa and Corpus Spongio- sum, which occasions a distension of the Penis. The relaxation of the Penis happens from the causes which produced the distension being removed; the elastic Ligamentous Membrane which covers the Penis again forcing the Blood from the Cells into the Veinsi Upon the Surface of the Penis, there are small super- ficial Veins, which communicate with those deeper seat-

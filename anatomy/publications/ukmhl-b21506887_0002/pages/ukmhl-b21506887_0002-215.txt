The Arteries of the Pleura are from those of the ad- jacent parts^ viz. from the Intercostal, Mammary, Dia- phragmatic, Bronchial, and Esophageal Arteries. The Veins, which return the Blood, accompany the Arteries, and are distinguished by the same names. The Nerves are from the Intercostals and Diaphrag- matics, but too small to be easily traced; and the Membrane itself is not observed to possess much sen- sibility in a sound state. The Pleura by its smoothness facilitates the motions of the Heart and Lungs, divides the Thorax into Ca- vities, and strengthens its containing and contained parts. ^^ Mediastinum. The Mediastinum, so named from its situation in the middle of ihe Thorax, extends, as has been already ob- served, between the Sternum and Vertebrag^ but is in- tercepted by the Heart and root of the Lungs, and di- vides the Thorax into two distinct Cavities, which have no communication with each other. It is formed by a reflection of the Pleura, and is of course double, and contains between its Layers a con- siderable quantity of Cellular Substance, by which they are united. It is divided into ^w^mor and Posterior Mediastinum, the former of which is situated at the fore, and the lat- ter at the back part of the Thorax. The Anterior Mediastinum is. connected before to

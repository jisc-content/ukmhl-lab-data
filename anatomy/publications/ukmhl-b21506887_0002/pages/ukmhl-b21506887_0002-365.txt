T Ossa Ischiaand Ossa Pubis, jto both of which they are intimately connected by Ligamentous Substance, being in a manner confounded there with the Periosteum. In their ascent along the Bones, they approach each other, like the strokes of the letter Y inverted, and at the under part of the Symphysis Pubis, unite, and con- tinue united till they reach the Glans, where they ter- minate in a rounded extremity. At the upper part of the root of the Penis, the Liga- mentous Sheath of the Corpora Cavernosa sends up a Process of a triangular form, to be connected to the Symphysis Pubis, under the name of Ligamentum iSzis- pensorium, by which the Body of the Penis is support- ed, and prevented from pressing too much upon the Scrotum. By the union of the Corpora Cavernosa, a Groove is left above, for the principal Vein of the Penis, and a Channel below, for the Spongy Substance of the U- rethra. The internal Substance of the Corpora Cavernosa consists of loose Reticular Plates, somewhat similar to the Cancelli in the ends of long Bones, and, like them, readily communicating with each other. Upon the Cells of the Corpora Cavernosa the Arte- ries are plentifully dispersed, and open freely into them ; the Blood of the Arteries tinging the Cells in the re- laxed state of the Penis, and filling them completely when it is distended. CuviER considers the Corpora Cavernosa as being formed of an extremely complicated texture, of ramifi- cations of Blood-vessels, particularly ^f Veins. The Corpora Cavernosa are united to each other by

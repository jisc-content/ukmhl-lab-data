Fart IV.] 01^ THE VISCERA, &c. 181 bout an inch in diameter, and of a firm callous nature, which is the mouth of the Pulmonary Artery. This is termed the Auricular Orifice of the Ventricle. The Right Ventricle, by its dilatation, receives the Blood from the Auricle, and sends it, by a strong, sudden, and convulsive contraction, to the Pulmonary Artery, from whence it is prevented from returning by three Valves placed in the Mouth of that Artery. The Valves at the Mouth of the Pulmonary Artery are called Valvulce Semilunares^ vel Sigmoidece, from the resemblance of their edges to those of a crescent. Two of them are placed in the fore, and one in the back part of the Artery. Each of them is turned upwards, so as to form a ^mall Sac, one edge of which adheres to a third part of the circumference of the inside of the Artery; the other edge is loose in the Cavity of that Vessel; and is somewhat thicker and stronger than the rest of the V^lveâ€”-the thickened edge serving it as a Ligament. The loose edge has a general Curve, divided into two smaller ones, which meet in a point at the middle. The Valves are chiefly formed of a doubling or ex- tension of the inner Coat of the Artery. In the middle point, or loose edge of each of the Valves, there is a small hard Triangular Granula, of a somewhat redder colour than the rest of the Valve, called, from its reputed Discoverers, Corpusculum Arantii, vel Corpusculum Morgagni ; or, from its resemblance in shape to the Seed of the Sesamum, Corpusculum Sesamoideum. The Corpuscles complete the Valves at the centre or Axis of the Artery, and enable them to make a

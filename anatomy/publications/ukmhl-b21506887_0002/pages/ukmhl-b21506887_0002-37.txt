Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. W The Anterior Lobes are situated in the fore part of the Base of the Cranium, and are the largest of the Lobes. The Lateral or middle Lobes are lodged in the Fossae formed by the Temporal and Sphenoid Bones, and are next in size to the former, but deeper. They pass in- sensibly into the posterior Lobes. Between the Anterior and Lateral Lobes on each side, there is a Furrow formed by the Anterior Clinoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone, which has been termed Fossa^ vel Fissura Magna Sylvii. The Posterior Lobes are placed over the Cerebellum, and are separated from it by the Tentorium, upon which they rest; the extreme points of these Lobes being nearly on a level with those of the Anterior Lobes. The Surface of the Brain in general, both above and below, is of a brown colour, and is divided by deep Fissures into many turnings or windings, termed Cir- cumvolutions, which run in various directions, close to each other, and are of different sizes and lengths on different parts of the Brain. The fissures between them also vary very considerably in depth. The Circumvolutions are every where connected to the Pia Mater by an infinite number of small Vessels, —called by Ruysch, Tomentum Cerebri,—which run at right angles into the Substance of the Brain, as may be readily seen, upon separating the Circumvolutions a little from each other, or by raising part of the Pia Mater from the Brain. The Convolutions are smallest at the fore part of the Brain, larger behind, and largest at the upper and middle parts of the Hemispheres, where each is from half an inch to three quarters of an inch in breadth.

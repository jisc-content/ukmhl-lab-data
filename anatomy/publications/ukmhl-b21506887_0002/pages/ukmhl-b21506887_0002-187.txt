Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 145 allowed to collect, the Gums are apt to be pressed from the sides of the Teeth, in consequence of which, they loosen in their Sockets and appear longer; and the loosening is increased by the Absorption of the Al- veoli. With respect to the Jaws, it is observed that they continue to become larger in proportion to the general size of the Head, till the person arrives at the prime of life. As age advances, the Teeth drop out, and chiefly from the causes mentioned above. The Alveolar Process disappears by being absorbed, and the distance between the Nose and Chin becomes considerably decreased. When the Jaws are now shut, the under projects beyond the upper one, at its anterior part, and in some measure overlaps it, the Jaws being then only opposed to each other behind. In cases of this kind, the Cavity of the Mouth becomes too small for the Tongue, and the food is masticated with difficulty. VOL, II. K

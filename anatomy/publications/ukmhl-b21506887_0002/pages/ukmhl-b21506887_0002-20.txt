8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Absorbents of the Cutis are proportionally large and numerous, and are observed, when minutely inject- ed, to have a reteform appearance. Nerves can be traced in great abundance into the inner part of the Skin, but their branches cannot be detected upon it externally. Upon the outer Surface of the Cutis, and produced chiefly by the extremities of the Cutaneous Nerves, small eminences are observed, called Papillae^ Papillce NervoscE, and Papillce Pyramidales :—the term being borrowed from the Papillas of the Tongue, which were first discovered, and to which the name is most appli- cable. From their being extremely sensible, they are consi- dered as forming the Organ of Touch ; and from their being very Vascular, they are also regarded as furnish- ing a passage to part of the Perspirable Matter. The Papillce are most evident on the Tongue and edge of the Lips, and in the Palms and Soles, where they are placed in double rov/s on the Ridges, which, on the points of the Fingers and Toes, generally run in a somewhat spiral and parallel direction. The Ridges are supposed to defend the Papillae, and to increase the Surface for Perspiration. In some places, as in the red part of the Lips, the Papillae, from their resemblance to the Pile of Velvet, are termed Villi. Various kinds of Folds are observed in the Skin; some depending upon the form of the Cellular Sub- stance, as in the Hips; others on Muscular Contraction, as in the Fore-head ; and others on Articular Motion, as at the Joints of the Extremities,—particularly those

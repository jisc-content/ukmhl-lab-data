220 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. After the Food in the Stomach has been exposed for some time to the Agents mentioned above, it loses its tenacity, becomes somewhat gelatinous, and is changed into a greyish-coloured pulpy Fluid termed Chyme. Besides the Aliments we take in, the Stomach and In- testines commonly contain different Gases, which appear to be generated there ; and also common Air, which is supposed to be swallowed with the Food. In the perfectly healthy state of the body, part of the Aeriform Fluid appears to be consumed, at least it does not increase to such a degree as to create any un- usual distension. The Gases which were found in the Stomachs of four criminals executed at Paris some time ago, were Oxy- gen, Carbonic Acid, Hydrogen, and Azote, in various proportions in the different parts of the Canal. From these experiments it appears, that the Oxygen Gas gradually decreases, and at last vanishes in the course of the Canal, while the proportion of the Carbo- nic Acid and Hydrogen Gases increases ; and that the largest proportion of the Gases in the Alimentary Ca- nal is Azote. INTESTINES. The Intestines consist of a long Cylindrical Canal, which begins at the Inferior Orifice of the Stomach, and, after winding in various directions, terminates in the Anus. In general they are about six times the length of the Body to which they belong ; though, in a person of

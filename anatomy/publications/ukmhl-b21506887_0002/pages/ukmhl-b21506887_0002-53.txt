41 Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, kc. In the Corpora Albicantia, various Medullary Strata terminate, which come from different parts of the Brain. Immediately before the Corpora Albicantia, is seen, the Infundibulum, leading from the third Ventricle. On the outside of the Corpora Albicantia, two white Cords, about three quarters of an inch in diameter, are observed, called Crura, vel Pedunculi Cerebri, vel Cru- ra Anteriora Medullce Ohlongatce, which arise from the Medullary Substance of the Brain, and gradually ap- proach each other in their course, till they unite with the Tuber Annulare. Their Surface is flat, and composed of distinct lon- gitudinal Medullary Fibres, with Grooves between them. Internally they are formed of a mixture of Ci- neritious and Medullary Matter, the former of which being of a darker colour at one particular part than in any other of the Brain, has been termed Locus Niger Crurum Cerebri. Between the Crura Cerebri, and likewise between the Corpora Albicantia, there is a Cineritious Sub- stance, called Pons Tarini, which joins these Bodies of the opposite sides together, and assists in forming the bottom of the third Ventricle. From the Medullary part of the Cerebellum, which forms the Trunk of the Arbor Vitas, two large white Cords also arise, under the name of Crura Cerebelli, vel Crura Posteriora^ vel Peduncidi Cerebelli, which unite with the Crura Cerebri, to compose the Tuber Annulare, vel Pons Varolii, so named from forming a Ring or Bridge over the Crura. This Ring is inti- mately incorporated with, and formed by, these Crura. The Tidjer Annidare is situated over the back part

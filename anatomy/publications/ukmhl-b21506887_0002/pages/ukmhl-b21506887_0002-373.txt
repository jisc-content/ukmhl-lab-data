The Kidneys, Renal Glands, and Ureters, have the same situation and structure as in the Male. The Bladder also holds the same place behind the Ossa Pubis, but rises higher when it is in the distend- ed state. It is proportionally larger than the Bladder of the Male, and is broader from one side to the other, corre- sponding to the Cavity of the Pelvis to which it be- longs, and to the quantity of Urine Females are some^ times under the necessity of retaining in it. The Urethra is much shorter,—being only about an inch and a half, or from that to two inches in length,—■ and straighter than in the Male, having only a slight curve downwards between its extremities.

^64 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. consequence of the Vena Cava, behind which it passes, being placed upon the right side of the Aorta. The Artery, as it approaches the Kidney, is divided into Branches, which are afterwards minutely distri- buted through the Cortical Substance, forming Arches and Anastomoses ; but these are found to be much less frequent than are commonly described ; for a fine In- jection thrown into a Branch of the Artery, fills only the Ramifications belonging to that Branch. * The small Branches, after turning and winding in various directions, pass partly towards the Surface of the Kidney, where they form irregular Stars, some of which supply the proper Membrane. Others turn inwards in a waving direction, and form Corpuscles^ or Acini, disposed somewhat after the man- ner of Clusters of small Berries, which can only be seen distinctly by the assistance of Glasses, after a minute Injection. The Corpuscles were considered by Dk Nichols, as the Globular terminations of Blood-vessels, and called by him Glohuli Arteriarum Termini; but these Glo- buli were afterwards observed by Mr Hewson, and others, to consist of small Vessels intimately intermixed. A fine Injection thrown into the Artery sometimes appears to fill the Uriniferous Tubes, and thereby to imitate the secretion of the Urine; but this experiment is more readily performed in some of the Brute Crea- tion, as the Horse, where the structure of the Kidney seems to be more simple than in Man. The Veins returning from the extremities of the Ar- teries, unite in the Cortical Substance of the Kidney. The Branches of the Renal Vein communicate freely.

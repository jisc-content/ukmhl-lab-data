18 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Upon the outer Surface of the Dura Mater, there are small fleshy-looking Bodies, placed at irregular distances, which are termed Glands of Pacchioni. These frequently project so much, as to make deep Pits in the Skull. The Dura Mater is composed of one Membrane, which, in several parts, is divisible by maceration into two, or even more Layers of Fibres. The Teocture of the Dura Mater is very dense. It is the thickest and strongest Membrane of the Body, and is composed of Tendinous-like Fibres, which have a shining appearance, particularly in its inner Surface. In many parts, these Fibres run in a variety of direc- tions, and decussate each other at different angles. The Dura Mater adheres every where to the Surface of the Cranium by Blood-vessels, in the same manner as the Periosteum adheres to the Bones in the other parts of the Body ; but it is more firmly connected at the Sutures and Foramina than elsewhere; and so much more firmly in Children than in Adults, that, in separating it from the Cranium, it is apt to bring along with it some of the Fibres of the Bone to which it is attached.â€”In the Adult, the separation of the Bone from the Membrane is less difficult, in consequence of many of the Fibres being obliterated. The inner Surface of the Dura Mater, which is re- markably smooth, is in close contact with the subjacent Membranes, and adheres to the Brain only where the Veins go into the Sinuses. It is lubricated by a Fluid discharged through its Vessels, which guards the Brain from danger, according as it may be affected by the different states of Respiration.

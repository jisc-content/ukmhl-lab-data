Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 341 The principal part of the Internal Iliacs is occupied in forming the Umbilical Arteries, which mount by the sides of the Bladder, on the outside of the Peritoneum, and perforate the Umbilicus in their progress to the Umbilical Cord. Soon after Delivery, the Foramen Ovale, Ductus Arteriosus, et Venosus, with the Umbilical Vein and Arteries, begin to contract, and are, in general, com- pletely closed, and the Vessels shrivelled into Ligaments, within a year after Birth,' though sometimes one or more» of them remain open to a much later period. This obliteration is produced by a contractile power in the parts, by the pressure of the surrounding Visce- ra, and by the Blood being directed through other channels. The Testes are lodged, during the greater part of Gestation, in the Cavity of the Abdomen, over the Psose Muscles, and a little below the Kidneys. They constitute a part of the Abdominal Viscera, and, in a similar manner with thernj are connected to the Body by a Production of the Peritoneum, which forms their Tunica Albuginea. The Epididymis is placed more upon the back part of the Testicle, and is proportionally larger than in an Adult. Between the Testicle and Scrotum, a Fibrous and Vascular Substance is extended,—called by Mr Hun- ter, Gtihernaculuin, vel Ligamentum Testis, which he considers as a principal agent in directing the course - of the Testicle, and in making way for it in its descent. The Ligamentum Testis is of a conical form, with the large end upwards, and fixed to the under part of

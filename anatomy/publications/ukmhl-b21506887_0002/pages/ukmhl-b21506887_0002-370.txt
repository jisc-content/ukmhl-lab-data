m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Cowper's Glands. They have likewise the name of Anti-prostatoe and Prostatoe Inferiores. They are situated at the sides of the Membranous part of the Urethra,—between its Bulb and the point of the Prostate Gland, but nearer the former,—and covered by the Acceleratores Uringe. Each sends out a small Duct, which terminates ob- liquely in the Urethra, at the bulbous part. They are observed to discharge a Fluid, which is supposed to serve the same purpose wath that of the Lacunae. The Arteries of the Penis are chiefly from the Pu- dicae Communes, which are Branches of the Internal Iliacs, and partly from the Femoral Arteries. Each of the Pudic Arteries having passed out of the Pelvis through the great Notch of the Os Ilium, runs between the Sacro-sciatic Ligaments to the inner side of the Tuber Ischii, from which it passes along the Crus of that Bone and of the Os Pubis, to the root of the Penis. In its course, it furnishes Branches to the adjacent parts, and afterwards gives off three principal Branches, which belong to the Penis :—One of these goes to the Bulb of the Urethra, to be dispersed in the Corpus Spongiosum ;—the other two, which are longer than the former, go to the Body of the Penis ; one of them pe- netrating its Crus, and running in the axis of the Cor- pus Cavernosum, as may be readily seen by a longi- tudinal section of this part ;• the other passing between the Symphysis Pubis and joining of the Crura Penis, and extending along the Dorsum as far as the Corona Glandis.

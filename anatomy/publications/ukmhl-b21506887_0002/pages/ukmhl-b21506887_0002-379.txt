Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. S03 be great or small, may be diminished, but cannot be increased. The Ovaria serve for the nourishment of the Ova, which contain the Rudiments of the Foetus, and may be said to be of the same importance in the Process of Generation that the Testes are in a Male. The Uterine, or Fallopian Tubes, compared in shape, by Fallopius, to that of a trumpet, are two Conical and Vermiform Canals, attached to the Corners of the Uterus, and terminating in it, each by a small Opening which scarcely admits the entrance of a Bristle. They become gradually larger in their passage to- wards the sides of the Pelvis; near their outer extre- mities, they are convoluted and considerably dilated, but are afterwards suddenly contracted, and terminate by open Mouths, each sufficiently large to admit the point of a Goose-quill. Their outer ends are free and fluctuating in the Pel- vis, and expand into many irregular jagged or pointed Processes, called Fimhrice, which are considerably longer at one side of the Tube than the other. The Tubes are commonly about four or five inches in length, and are contained in a Doubling of the Liga- menta Lata.â€”In their natural situation, they lie near the Ovaria; but when drawn out and extended, are a finger's-breadth distant from them. The Structure of the Tubes somewhat resembles that of the Uterus, and, like it, they are capable of di- latation and contraction : Their inner side, however, is of a different nature, being furnished with many small longitudinal Plicae, which have a Muscular ap- pearance, and which are most conspicuous towards the

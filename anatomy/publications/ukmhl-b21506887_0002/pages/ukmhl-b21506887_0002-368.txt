'2m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. merely a Plexus of convoluted Blood-vessels, particu- larly of Veins. The Urethra is a long and very elastic Canal, the common diameter of which is nearly equal to that of a writing-pen, though it is capable of receiving bodies of a greater size. It begins at the under and fore part of the Bladder, and here the Apex of the Trigone of LieutAUD frequently projects, and is sometimes call- ed La-Luette, or Uvula Vesicce. The Urethra, at its beginning, is inclosed by the Prostate Gland; it runs next through the Corpus Spongiosum, and terminates in the point of the Penis by a longitudinal Orifice, the whole length commonly including a space of eight or nine inches. At its Origin it descends a little, and then passes for- wards under the Symphysisof the Ossa Pubis ; to which it is closely connected by Cellular Substance, It then ascends, in a curved direction, at the outer and fore part of the Ossa Pubis ; varying in the remainder of its course, according to the different degrees of relaxa- tion or distension of the Penis. There are commonly three Dilatations in the Ure- thra ; one of which is in the Prostate Gland, the se- cond in the Bulb of the Urethra, and the third, which is sometimes called Fossicula Navicularis, about the beginning or back part of the Glans. In general, it has also the same number of slight Con- tractions ; the first at its origin from the Bladder, the second between the point of the Prostate Gland and Bulb of the Urethra, and the third at the point of the Glans. Between the point of the Prostate Gland and part where the" Urethra penetrates the Corpus Spongiosum,

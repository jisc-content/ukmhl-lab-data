172 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. contraction of its Body. The situation, however, varies in a small degree, according to the position of the Tho- rax, and state of Respiration. Though this be the common situation of the Heart, a few rare and singular instances have occurred, where it has been found to occupy the right side of the Tho- rax ; and a displacement has sometimes happened, in consequence of different kinds of Tumours occurring in the left side of this Cavity. The Superior or Anterior Surface of the Heart is convex, and is opposed to the posterior Surface of the Sternum and Cartilages of the Ribs ; the anterior edges of the Lungs intervening. The Irvferior or Posterior Surface is flat, and rests upon the Tendon of the Diaphragm which supports it. The Heart is not much affected, however, by the mo- tions of that Muscle in time of respiration; its Ten- don moving only in a small degree. . The Apex Cordis lies directly behind the Cartilages of the Ribs, the Left Lung not intervening, but form- ing at this place a curve about the Heart. The right side of the Body of the Heart is thin and sharp, and is called, by De Halle r, Mar go Acutus. The left side is thick and round, and is termed, by the same Author, Mar go Ohtusus. The Base is formed of a Right and Left Auricle, and the Body of a Right and Left Ventricle. The Apex is commonly formed by the Left Ventri- cle, but sometimes there are two Apices, one belonging to each Ventricle. When all the Cavities of the Heart are distended, the Right Auricle, and part of the corresponding Ventricle,

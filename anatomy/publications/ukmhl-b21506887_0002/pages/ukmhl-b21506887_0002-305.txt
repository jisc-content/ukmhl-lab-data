Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. ^55 of the Body, in proportion to the size of the Viscus in which they are dispersed. The Artery is a principal Branch of the Coeliac.â€”It runs in a serpentine direction, which lessens the force of the Blood sent to this tender Organ. After sending Branches to the Pancreas, &c. and the Arteries Breves to the left end of the Stomach, it goes into the Substance of the Spleen, where it is subdivided into Branches, which are crowded together, and run in every direc- tion, forming at length Plexus and Penicilli, which ter- minate in the Branches of the corresponding Vein. The Vein^ like that in most other Viscera, is larger than the Artery : It receives the Blood immediately from the terminations of the Artery, without the inter- vention of Cells. The Splenic Vein receives the VenoB Breves of the Stomach, the Pancreatic Veins, &c. and forms one of the principal Branches of the Vena Portse. The Lymphatics from the superficial parts of the Spleen join the deep-seated Absorbents at the Fissure where the Blood-vessels enter, and afterwards pass through several Conglobate Glands lying over the Splenic Artery. They intermix with Lymphatics belonging to several other Viscera, and terminate in the Thoracic Duct. The Nerves of the Spleen, which are small, but con- siderable in number, are Branches of the Great Sym- pathetic and Eighth Pair, and form an irregular Plexus which surrounds the Vessels. No Excretory Duct has been found to proceed from the Spleen, in consequence of which very various hy-

Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 67 an inch ; while the posterior Surface is only equal to the segment of a sphere of about five lines in diameter. It has been observed by Zinn,—that the figure of the Lens varies at different periods, being in a Foetus almost of a spherical form, but becoming gradually flatter on the anterior and posterior Surfaces, till about the age of ^thirty, after which its form does not appear to vary. As the figure, so also the colour and consistency, are found to change at different times of life.—In a Foe- tus, not only a Cs^sule, which covers it, but the Lens also, is of a reddish colour; but immediately after Birth they become perfectly transparent.—In a person con- siderably advanced in years, the Lens is observed to acquire a yellow tinge, which appears first in the centre, and afterwards extends gradually to the circumference; and in extreme old age, this yellow tinge becomes so deep as to resemble Amber. An Aqueous Fluid is described as being situated be- tween the Crystalline Lamellae, which is supposed to decrease in quantity, and to become somewhat yellow, the Lens at the same time increasing in solidity as the Person advances in life.—This difference, however, of convexity, colour, and consistence, according to the difference of age, is not met with uniformly. The Lens becomes opake, soon after death, and acquires an additional opacity when put into Spirit of Wine. It is composed of concentric Lamellae, laid over each other like the coats of an Onion. These Lamellas are connected by fine Cellular Substance, and are more closely compacted the nearer they are to the centre.

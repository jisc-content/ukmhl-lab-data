6^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. of two or more Striae. They are not all of an equal size, and many of them are forked at their extremities. The Corpus Ciliare, formed of the Ciliary Striae and Ciliary Processes, has no appearance of Muscularity, though the contrary has been supposed by some Au- thors. A fine Injection shews it to be chiefly composed of a continuance of the Blood-vessels of the Choroid Coat, the Branches of which divide into such minute parts, as to give the whole a Villous appearance. The Corpus Ciliare is glued to the Retina, at the fore part of the Vitreous Humour, and a little behind the edge of the Crystalline Lens; but the Ciliary Processes float in the Aqueous Humour in the Posterior Cham- ber of the Eye, at the inner side of the root of the Iris, and may be readily turned back behind the edge of the Lens, to which they are contiguous, but do not adhere, of course cannot be supposed to compress it, though this has been the opinion of some Writers. The Choroid Coat, with its dark paint, serves to absorb the rays of light which pass through the Retina, thereby allowing a distinct image to be formed upon the bottom of the Eye, and preventing the rays from being reflected so as to form a second image. In those Animals in which this Coat, or its paint, is of a bright colour, it acts as a mirror to reflect light, and make the impression stronger. . Optic Nerve and Retina. The Optic Nerve^ in its passage through the Orbit, is covered by a continuation of the Membranes which surround the Brain.

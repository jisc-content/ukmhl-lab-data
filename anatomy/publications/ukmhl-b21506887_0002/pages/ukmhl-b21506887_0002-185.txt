Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 143 against the Bony partitions placed between them and the Temporary Teeth, and then against the posterior Surface of the roots of these Teeth, till at length the greater portion, or the whole of the parts pressed a- gainst, are absorbed. The Permanent Teeth now come forwards under the Temporary Set, which, by the pressure being conti- nued, soon drop out. Besides the causes mentioned above, with respect to the shedding of the Teeth, others contribute; for now and then the Temporary Teeth drop out long before the Permanent Teeth appear, and sometimes where they never appear. That absorption of the first Set is much influenced, however, by the pressure of the second Set, is rendered probable, from the instances where one or more of the Temporary Teeth have been observed remaining in the Jaws for many years, and where, upon examina- tion, no Permanent Teeth have been found to be formed. In some very rare instances, a third Set of Teeth appear at a very advanced age. Of the Growth of the Jaws. After all the Temporary Teeth have appeared through the Gums, the Jaws are observed to grow little in the parts the Teeth occupy. The Lower Jaw receives its greatest increase be- tween the second Temporary Molaris and the Coronoid Process, the lengthened part being destined for the Permanent Molares.

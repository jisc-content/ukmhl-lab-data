98 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. and is parallel to the length of the Pars Petrosa, with the convex side turned backwards.—One of its extremi- ties is placed above, and the other below, the upper ex- tremity joining with the internal one of the Vertical Ca- nal, by which a common Passage is formed. The Exterior, less than either of the other two, which are more of an equal size, is placed next the Tympanum, and has its extremities and curvature nearly upon the same plane;—with the convex part of the curve placed backwards. Each of the Canals forms upwards of three fourths of a Circle, can admit the head of a small Pin, and has a slight Dilatation, an Ampulla, or Cavitas Elliptica, at one end, the other extremity being nearly of the same size with the rest of the Canal. The Orifices are only five in number, two of the Ca- nals having a common termination. Of these Orifices, three are situated at the inside, and two at the outside of the Vestibule, into the posterior part of which the diiferent Canals open, without being closed by any Membrane. In the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, which is situated in the posterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, there is a large under, and a small upper Fos~ sula, separated by a sharp Ridge. The fore part of the inferior Fossula leads towards the Cochlea, and is perforated by numberless minute Holes, through which Branches of the Portio Mollis of the Seventh Pair of Nerves pass to the Cochlea. One Hole in the Centre, larger than the rest, trans- mits a Branch of that Nerve to the Infundibulum. This Hole, however, is frequently seen enlarged, in con-

78 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. NERVES OF THE EYE. Besides the Optic Nerve, already taken notice of, the Eye receives the Third and Fourth Nerves, and Branches from the first portion of the Fifth, together with the Sixth, and Branches from the Seventh. The parts about the Fore side of the Orbit are sup- plied by Branches from the Fifth and Seventh Nerves; —the Ball of the Eye by Nerves called Ciliary, which come from the Third and Fifth ;—the Fat, Muscles, Lacrymal Gland, &c. are supplied by the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Nerves. OF VISION. The Humours of the Eye, and especially the Crys- talline Lens, receive and collect the Rays of light, in such a manner as to form upon the Retina the image or picture of the object which the Eye looks at; and the point where the different rays meet is called the Focus. The object is painted upon the Retina in an inverted manner, the rays from above being reflected to its under, and those from below to its upper part; while the rays from the right side of the object are sent to the left, and those from the left to the right side of the Eye. The rays which go through the centre of the Cornea pass in a perpendicular direction to the bottom of the Eye; and it is supposed to be'by habit, or rather by in- stinct, that we judge of the real situation of any object.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 173 project into the right, and the rest of the Heart into the left Cavity of the Thorax. The Heart is connected above and behind to the up- per and back part of the Thorax, through the Medium of the great Vessels which go into, or pass out from it. The other parts of the Heart are free, being merely contiguous to the inside of the Pericardium. The External Surface of the Heart is covered by a thin, smooth. Serous Membrane, which is a reflection of the inner Layer of the Pericardium, and which gives additional strength to its Fleshy Fibres. Between this Coat and the Substance of the Heart, there is commonly a considerable quantity of F(My which lubricates it, and facilitates its motions. In the interstices of the Fat, the Heart has some- what of a pink appearance, interspersed with whitish lines, formed by the Branches of Blood-vessels and Nerves. The Fat is chiefly placed in the Grooves between the Auricles and Ventricles, in the Furrows which dis- tinguish the Ventricles from each other, and along the principal Ramifications of the Blood-vessels ; the Au- ricles are, for the most part, destitute of Fat. The Substance of the Heart consists of what is call- ed the Muscular Coat of the Heart; here the Fibres are smaller but firmer, and more closely connected than the Fibres of Muscles generally are in the other parts of the Body. The Fibres of the Heart run in different directions, longitudinally and transversely, but most of them ob- liquely. Many of them run over the point of the Heart from

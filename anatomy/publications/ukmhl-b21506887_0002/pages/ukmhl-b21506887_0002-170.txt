128 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. the Fangs of the Temporary Teeth during the second Dentition ;—the removal of part of the Teeth in conse- quence of ulceration within them;—by the colour given, from the internal use of Madder, to the Osseous Sub-^ stance of the Teeth, disappearing after the use of it has been for some time discontinued; —by the swell- ing of the Lymphatic Glands from a Carious Tooth ; —and the disappearing of part of the internal Sub- stance of the Teeth of such large Animals as Ele- phants, where the Tusks-have been found with extra- neous Bodies forced into, and lodged within them. The Substance of the Osseous part of the Teeth, like that of Bone in other parts of the Body, is lamel- lated. It differs chiefly in being harder and more dense, in having its Fibres generally in a longitudinal direction, and in having a partial covering from the Enamel. The Teeth are fixed in their Sockets by Gomphosis, i. e. like a Nail in a Board, and attached to the Alveoli by a strong Periosteum. The Periosteum lines the Sockets, and is reflected upon the Fangs as far as the Necks of the Teeth, where it is intimately connected with the Gums ; but all that portion of the Teeth that appears beyond the Gums is destitute of this Mem- brane. The Teeth serve to masticate the Aliment, to assist in pronouncing several of the Letters, and are orna- mental to the Face.

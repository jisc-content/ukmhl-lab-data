76 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PaetIV. gular Process of the Os Frontis, and is here inclosed in a Bursa Mucosa. From this it goes a little down- wards, and is then reflected backwards and somewhat outwards, passing under the Levator Oculi. Insertion: By a broad thin Tendon, into the Tunica Sclerotica, about half-way between the Insertion of the Levator Oculi, and entrance of the Optic Nerve. Action : To roll the Ball of the Eye, by turning the Pupil downwards and outwards. Obliquus Inferior, Vel Obliquus Minor. Origin: By a narrow beginning, from the anterior edge of the Orbitar Process of the Superior Maxillary Bone, near the Lacrymal Groove, from which it passes obliquely outwards, backwards, and upwards, round the Ball of the Eye. Insertion :â–  By a broad thin Tendon, into the Scle- rotic Coat, between the entrance of the Optic Nerve and insertion of the Abductor Oculi, and opposite to the insertion of the Obliquus Superior. Action : To roll the Ball of the Eye, by turning the Pupil upwards and inwards, and, with the assistance of the Obliquus Superior, to pull the Eye forwards. By some the two Oblique Muscles have been consider- ed, in consequence of their situation, so to constrict the back part of the Eye, as to lengthen its Axis there, and thereby increase the distance between the Lens and bottom of the Retina. The two Oblique Muscles, on account of rolling the

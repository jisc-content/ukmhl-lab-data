68 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Fart IV. This Lamellated Structure may be readily observed in the Eye of an Ox, or any other large Animal, but is most evident when the Lens has been boiled in water, or macerated in water or vinegar. When the maceration is continued for some time, the Lamellae put on a radiated appearance, the Radii run- ning in a vertical manner, or issuing from the centre to the circumference, dividing the Surface into Isosceles Triangles, or like the Meridian lines running between the two Poles of a Geographical Globe. The Lamellae were discovered by Leuwenhoeck to be of a Fibrous structure. By some Authors these Fi- bres have been considered as Muscular, and capable of varying the convexity of the Lens according to the dis- tance of the objects we look at; but it is observed, that the Eyes from which the Lens has been removed, are, by the assistance of Glasses, enabled to form distinct Vision. The Substance of the Lens somewhat resembles half- melted Gum, is very soft and tender on the outside, but becomes gradually firmer and tougher towards the centre, where it forms a Nucleus, in consequence of which its refractive power is found to be more equal than any Lens produced by art. The Lens is surrounded by a very pellucid proper Capsule, called Tunica Arajiea, vel Crystallina, which is much thicker and more elastic than the Capsule of the Vitreous Humour, but adheres so slightly to it, and is so easily lacerated, that after a small punc- ture is made in it, the Lens starts out, upon applying gentle pressure to the Capsule. The posterior part of the Capsule is much thinner,

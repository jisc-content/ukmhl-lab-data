330 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, denser, than the former, and is connected with the Spongy Chorion as far as the edge of the Placenta, where it separates from it. It is next reflected over that Surface of the Placenta which is opposed to the Foetus, and is afterwards continued over the whole of the Cord, and terminates at the Umbilicus. it is uniform in its texture, has a transparent appear- ance, adheres to the Spongy Chorion and Surface of the Placenta by a delicate Cellular Substance, and has no Vessels visible to the naked Eye, or which can be injected. The Amnios lines the whole Surface of the True Chorion, and, with it, is reflected from the Placenta over the whole length of the Cord, which it supplies with an external Covering. It is thinner, (but at this period stronger), more dense, and transparent, than the Chorion, to which it adheres every where by a tough Jelly. It is smooth and polished on the side next the Foe- tus, and is destitute of Blood-vessels. The Membranes, besides containing the Child and Waters, give origin to the latter, and, in the time of Labour, assist in opening the Orifice of the Uterus. The Waters, called Liqtior Amnii, are thinnest and clearest in the first Months, after which they acquire some degree of colour and ropiness. The Liquor Amnii is chiefly composed of the Serum of the Blood. It has a slight whitish or yellowish tint, h weak pleasant odour, and a saltish taste. In its natu- ral state, it has all the characters of the Liquor Peri- cardii, or of the Liquors exhaled from the Surfaces of other Membranes similar to the Pericardium. Accord-

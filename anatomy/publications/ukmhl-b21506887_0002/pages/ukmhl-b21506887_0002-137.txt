Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. lOS —-one to the Cochlea, the other to the Vestibule and Semicircular Canals. The Branches to the Cochlea pass through the Cri- briform Plates of the Modiolus, to the Pulpy. Mem- brane lying on the Scalae. The Branches run between, and likewise on the out- side of the Partitions which divide the Cochlea into Gyri, and the Gyri into Scalae, and are large and nu- merous in proportion to the part they supply. The largest and most numerous of these Branches are dispersed upon the Lamina Spiralis, where they form an intricate Plexus, the threads of which are at first opake, but are afterwards of the colour of the Re* tina of the Eye. The Branches terminate, and appear almost to meet, upon that part of the Pulpy Membrane which is most distant from the Modiolus. Through the Cribriform Plate, common to the Mo- diolus and Infundibulum, the last Branches of this Por- tion of the Nerves pass to be spread out upon the Mem- brane lying within the Infundibulum.—For a particu- lar description of that part of the Portio Mollis distri- buted to the Cochlea^ and of the Cochlea itself see Dr Monro's Treatise on the Ear. Of that part of the Portio Mollis destined for the Vestibule and Semicircular Canals, one Branch goes through the posterior Hole in the upper part of the Meatus Internus ; the rest pass through the Holes in the under and back part of the Meatus, already point- ed out in the description of that passage. Having perforated the Eoramina, the Nerves are seen first in distinct Plexus, after which they become trans-

01^' THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. perior Cava, is traasmitted to the Right Auricle and Ventricle, and from thence to the Pulmonary Artery. From the Pulmonary Artery one portion of it passes by the Right and Left Pulmonary Branches, through the Lungs, as in an Adult, and another goes by the Ductus Arteriosus to the Aorta Descendens. From the Lungs it is returned by the Pulmonary Veins to the Left Auricle, where it mixes with that coming from the Right Auricle by the Foramen Ovale. It goes through the Foramen Ovale in such propor- tions, as to allow equal quantities of Blood to circu- late through the right and left sides of the Heart at the same time. The Blood is afterwards sent by the Aorta to the different parts of the Body, to be return- ed by the Veins . From the Iliac Arteries, it is conveyed by the Um- bilical Arteries to the Substance of the Placenta, where one portion of it returns by corresponding Veins to the Foetus, the rest going to the Uterus in the man- ner it was discharged from the Uterine Arteries to the Branches of the Umbilical Vein.

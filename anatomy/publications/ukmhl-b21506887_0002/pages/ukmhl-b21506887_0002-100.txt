72 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOxMY. [Part IV. Lens,—which is at the same distance behind the edge of the Lens with the distance of the insertion of the Ciliary Zone before it,—a passage is formed, named Canalis Petitianus, after Petit, who discovered it. The Membranes forming this passage are pervaded by transverse Fibres, in such a manner, that when Air is introduced, it goes freely round the edge of the Lens; but the Passage has a Cellular appearance, being con- tracted and dilated alternately. The Canal of Petit is nearly of the same breadth with the Corpus Ciliare, is always empty, and has no communication with the Capsules of the Vitreous or Crystalline Humours. No Vessels are to be seen in the Vitreous Humour of an Adult; but in the Eye of a Foetus, an Artery is observed to arise from the Central one of the Retina, which passes through the middle of the Vitreous Hu- mour, sending Twigs to the Cellular Texture of this Humour, while the principal Trunk is continued to the Capsule of the Crystalline Lens, as has been already observed. The Vitreous Humour serves to give shape to the Eye, to keep the Coats properly expanded, to preserve the due distance of the Lens from the Bottom of the Eye, and direct the rays of light to the Retina. MUSCLES OF THE BALL OF THE EVE. The Ball of the Eye is moved by sia; Muscles', which are divided, on account of their direction, in- to Jmir straight and two ohliqtie, obtaining their re-

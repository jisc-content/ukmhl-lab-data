224 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. itself, but the diameter not larger that that of a Goose- quill,â€”termed Appendioc Vermi/brmis, from its resem- blance to an Earth-worm, and Appendix CcBci, from its connexion with the Caecum. It is convoluted, variable in its length, and fixed by its sides to the Caecum. It has two extremities, one of which is impervious, the other opens obliquely into the back part of the Caecum. The Colon is by much the longest of the large Intes- tines. It encircles the small Guts, and is contiguous to most of the Abdominal Viscera.

It ascends in the Right Lumbar Region, over the Kidney of that side, to which it is connected, and is here sometimes termed Colon Dextrum. From the Kidney, it passes forwards, and crosses the Abdomen in the Epigastric and Hypochondriac Re- gions connected to the Duodenum, under the name of Great Arch of the Colon^ or Colon Transversum. The right portion of the Great Arch is situated un- der the Liver and Gall-Bladder, the latter of which, after Death, commonly tinges part of it and the Duo- denum with Bile.

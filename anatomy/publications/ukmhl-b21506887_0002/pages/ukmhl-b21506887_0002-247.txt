Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 197 Absorbents, together with small branches of l^erves, enter into the composition of the Lungs. ' Teachea. The Trachea, vel Aspera Arteria, so called from the inequality of its Surface, and from its conveying Air, is a Cartilago-Membranous Tube, which begins at the under part of the Cricoid Cartilage, and descends in the fore part of the Neck, covered at first by the Thy- roid Gland and Sterno-hyoidei, and afterwards by the Skin and Cellular Substance only. Its lateral parts are concealed by the Sterno-hyoidei and Sterno-thyroidei. From the Neck, it passes into the Thorax, where it is situated between the Layers of the upper part of the Posterior Mediastinum. Behind the Curvature of the Aorta, and opposite to the Third Dorsal Vertebra, the Trachea divides into two lateral Branches, termed Bronchi, one of which goes directly to the Right, and the other, which is the longer, but rather the smaller of the two, passes under the Arch of the Aorta to the Left Lung. Each of the Bronchi is subdivided at the place where it enters the Lung, the Right separating into three principal Branches, the Left often only into two. In the Substance of the Lungs, the Bronchial Branches are every where distributed, each Branch running be- tween a corresponding Ramification of an Artery and Vein. They divide and subdivide after the manner of the branching of a Tree. They become smaller and smaller, till at length they form an infinite number of Capillary Tubes, which, di-

236 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. with the other Intestines, but contains no Faeces. It is furnished with numerous Glands, similar to those of the Duodenum, the contents of which pass into the Caecum, a little below the Valve of the Colon, and as- sist in lubricating that Intestine, and facilitating the expulsion of the Faeculent Matter. In the Caecum and beginning of the Colon, the Food coming from the Ilium is retained for some time, and, in consequence of Absorption, acquires a greater de- gree of consistency. Here also it receives its faetid smell. After this, it may properly be considered as Excrementitious Matter. The Valvula CoZz,—r-sometimes called Valvula Ilii, or Vdlvula Bauhini, from its supposed Discoverer, and Valvula TuLPii, from the Author who gives a particu- lar description of it,—is situated at the beginning of the Colon, and is placed transversely in the posterior and left part of that Intestine. It is formed of a Projection of the Villous and Ner- vous Coats, and Circular Muscular Fibres of the Ilium, Caecum, and Colon, and has two Folds or Lips, with an Aperture in form of a Mouth or Chink between them ; but the size of the Folds, and of the Opening they inclose, varies in different Persons. At the ends of the Valves are two Cords, termed Retinacula, vel FrcBna Morgaqni, which retain the Valve in its proper situation. The Valve of the Colon allows a free passage for the contents of the Small into the Large Intestines, but completely prevents their return. The Colon is of a similar structure with the Caecum. —The inner Surface is smooth.—The Longitudinal

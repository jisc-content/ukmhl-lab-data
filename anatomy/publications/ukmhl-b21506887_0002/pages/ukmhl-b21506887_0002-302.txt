COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Secretion of the Bile is found, by experiment, to be constant, and to the quantity of from half a pound to a pound in the twenty-four hours, but always flow- ing in greatest abundance soon after taking in nourish- ment. The Bile has a bitter taste, and is of a viscid con- sistence, of a yellowish colour changing to green, but occasionally varying a little in this respect. It is fre- quently of a brownish-yellow, and sometimes, especial- ly in cases of Schirrous Liver, colourless. The Bile returning from the Gall-Bladder, is ob- served, from the thinner parts being absorbed, to be more tenacious, acrid, and bitter, and of k deeper co- lour, than that which flows from the Liver. According to the experiments of Thenard, one of the latest Writers on Bile, 1100 parts of this Fluid, taken from the Human Body, contain 1000 of Water, from 2 to 10 of yellow insoluble Matter, 42 of Albu- rnen, 41 of Resin, 5.6 of Soda, 4.5 of Phosphate of Soda, Sulphate of Soda, Muriate of Soda, Phosphate of Lime, and Oxide of Iron. Thenard did not find Picromel in the Human Bile ; but Berzelius found it in it, as well as in the Bile of ^n Ox. The Bile serves to mix the difierent parts of the Food properly together, for the formation of the Chyle, —to combine with the excrementitious part, and pre- vent its absorption,—to correct too great a disposition to acidity, and to excite the Peristaltic motion of the Intestines, and thereby to facilitate the evacuation of their contents.

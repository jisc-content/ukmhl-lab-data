142 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Then the first, or anterior Temporary Molares come out, and are succeeded by the anterior Bicuspidati. Then the Cuspidati and second Temporary Molares are succeeded by the Permanent Cuspidati and poste- rior Bicuspidati. The second Permanent Molares ap- pear some time afterward. The whole shedding of the Teeth occupies a space of five or six years. The Dentes Sapientiae do not appear till between the eighteenth and twenty-first years; sometimes, however, they appear a year or two sooner, and frequently not till some years later. The number of the Teeth does not increase till be- tween the sixth and eighth years, when the Teeth that first made their appearance through the Gums are shed, and are replaced by others, and more soon begin to appear farther back in the Jaws. The Second Set of Teeth, it is found, contrary to the opinion of former times, do not push out the first, the second Set being formed in Sockets of their own, and the Fangs of the first Set gradually decaying as the succeeding Teeth grow; the decaying of the Fangs of the first Set being in proportion to the decay of the first Set of Sockets. The Permanent Teeth arise in Sockets appropriated to themselves, and are inclosed in these Sockets after the Temporary Teeth have been shed. During the growth of the Permanent Teeth, absorp- tion proceeds in the Fangs of the Temporary Set, which facilitates their removal from the Sockets, and affords a Passage for the Permanent Teeth. While the Permanent Teeth increase in size, they occupy more space, come forwards, produce a pressure

S50 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Gall-Bladder is connected through its whole length to the Liver by Cellular Substance, Blood-vessels, and Absorbents, as well as by its Peritoneal Covering. In many Brute Animals, the Gall-Bladder is connect- ed to the Liver also by a Set of Ducts, called Hepato- cystic^ which convey the Bile into the Gall-Bladder immediately from the Liver. No such Ducts, how- ever, are demonstrable in the Human Body, though, in former times, the contrary has been maintained by different Authors. The Gall-Bladder has Blood-vessels, Absorbents, and Nerves, in common with those of the Liver.—Its Veins pass into the Vena Portag. The Cervix or Neck of the Gall-Bladder is twisted and folded against itself, and afterwards contracts and sends out a Duct called Cystic^ which runs at the Right side of the Ductus Hepaticus^ and then joins it, at a sharp Angle, to form the Ductus Communis Choledochus. The Ductus Cysticus is smaller than the Ductus He- paticus, and differs from it also in having a number of Imperfect Partitions or Plicce, running in a somewhat Spiral direction, and forming it into Cells, which re- tard the flow of the Bile. The Gall-Bladder serves as a receptacle for the Bile when the Stomach and Intestines are empty, and have no need of it, and retains it till wanted for the purpose of Digestion.—The Bile is afterwards discharged from the Gall-Bladder, when the Stomach is full, into the Ductus Communis, and from that to the Duodenum, chiefly by the pressure of the surrounding Viscera, and partly, as some Anatomists suppose, by a small degree of contractile power in the Gall-Bladder itself.

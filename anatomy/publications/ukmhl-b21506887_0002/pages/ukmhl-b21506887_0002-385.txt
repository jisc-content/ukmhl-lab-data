309 Fart IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. External Parts of Generation. The Etxternal Parts are those which may be seen without dissection. They consist of the Pudendum, and what it incloses. The Pudendum^ or Vulva, is formed of two prominent sides, termed Labia Pudendi, Labia Externa, vel Alee Mc0ores. These are contigu- ous when the Limbs are not much separated, thereby preventing the access of Air to the Internal Parts, which they at the same time protect and conceal. The upper part of the Pudendum, named Pubes, or Mons Veneris, is situated on the fore side of the Ossa Pubis, and is covered with Hair similar to that in a Male, to prevent the Skin from being injured by vene- real intercourse. In both Sexes, the Hairs begin to grow about the same period of life. The Pubes is composed of the common Integuments, under which a considerable quantity of Fat is situated, rendering it thick, soft, and prominent. The Labia Pudendi extend from the Pubes to with- in an inch of the Anus, the space between the Puden- dum and Anus obtaining the name of Perineum, from a Moisture supposed to flow about this part of the Skin. --^It is sometimes also called Anterior Perineum, to distinguish it from that part which extends from the Anus to the Coccyx, termed by some Anatomists, Pos- terior Perineum. The Opening between the two Labia has the name of Fossa Magna.â€”It increases a little in size and depth as it descends, and forms a small Boat-like Cavity at its under extremity, termed Fossa Navicularis.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 28l stance of the Testicle, where they are minutely distri- buted upon the Surface of the Seminal Tubes. Besides the Spermatic Artery, there is a smaller one from the Hypogastric, and frequently also a minute Branch from the Epigastric Artery, which accompany the Vas Deferens, and are dispersed along with the other Artery. The Veins are much larger than the corresponding Arteries, and have several Valves in them, especially without the Abdomen, contrary to what belongs to the Veins of the other Viscera. They form a Plexus, which accompanies the Artery on each side, and is sometimes called Corpus Pampyni- forme, from a supposed resemblance to the Shoots of a Vine ; or Corpus Pyramidale, from giving a Pyramidal form to the Cord. The Plexus ascends in the Abdomen, upon the Sur- face of the Psoas ; and about the part where it recedes from the Artery it forms a single Trunk, which, in the right side, terminates in the Vena Cava, nearly oppo- site to the origin of the Artery, and, in the left side, goes into the Renal Vein. There is also a small inferior Spermatic Vein, which accompanies its Artery, and ends in the Hypogastric Vein. The Nerves of the Testes are derived from the Renal, Aortic, and Lumbar Plexus, and, though very minute, they give the Testicle a more exquisite feeling than is bestowed on any other Secretory Organ. The Tuhuli Seminiferi, in the body of the Testicle, consist of numberless minute Ducts, which are of a Cy- lindrical form, have no division into Branches, and.

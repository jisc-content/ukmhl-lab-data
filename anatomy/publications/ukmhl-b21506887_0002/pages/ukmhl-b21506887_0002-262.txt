COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Absorbents are numerous, and run chiefly to the Iliac and Lumbar Plexus. The Nerves, which are few in number and small, are from the Phrenic, the Inferior Dorsal, the Lumbar, the Great Sympathetic and Sacral Nerves. Its Blood-vessels, however, are not very numerous, neither does it possess much Sensibility when free from disease. The Peritoneum lines and strengthens the Cavity of the Abdomen; incloses and assists in supporting the different Viscera ; furnishes most of them with an Ex- ternal Coat; connects them to the Body ; and, by its smoothness and slipperiness, prevents the effects of Friction. Between the Peritoneum and Abdominal Muscles, are Four White Lines, or small Cords, three of which are Vessels in the Foetus,—one of them a Vein, and two of them Arteries ; the fourth is the Urachus.—In an Adult, they are shrivelled, and serve as Ligaments; the Vein forming the round Ligament of the Liver, the three other Cords forming Ligaments of the Bladder. STOMACH. The Stomach is a large Bag or Reservoir, situated obliquely across the upper and back part of the Abdo- men, in the Epigastric and left Hypochondriac Re- gions. It is turned downwards and forwards, so as to form an Angle with the Esophagus, the Angle becoming more conspicuous in proportion as the Stomach is more distended.

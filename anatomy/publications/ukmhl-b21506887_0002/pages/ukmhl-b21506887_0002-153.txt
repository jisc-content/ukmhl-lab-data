Ill with in the Human Body, and even then it is very mi- nute ; though it is always to be found, and of consi- derable size, in the Ox, Horse, Sheep, &c« When present, it takes its origin from a small Pit, formed in the fore part of the bottom of the Nostril, under the termination of the Lacrymal Duct. It runs obliquely downwards and forwards, placed in such a manner as to receive and conduct the Tears into the Mouth. The Arteries of the Nose come chiefly from the Ex- ternal Carotids. Those of the outer part of the Nose come from the Facial and Internal Maxillary Arteries;—-those of the inner from the Internal Maxillary ; and a few Twigs are furnished by the Ocular Arteries. The Veins go to the External Jugulars. They like- wise communicate with the Ocular Veins, and of course with the Lateral Sinuses and internal Jugulars. The Nerves with which the outer part of the Nose is chiefly supplied, come from the second Branch of the Fifth, and from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pairs, The inner part is principally supplied by the First Pair, or Olfactory Nerves, and by some Branches from the first and second Portions of the Fifth Pair. The Nose constitutes the Organ of Smelling,—con- tributes to the general purposes of Respiration and the modelling of the voice,—receives the superabundant humours from the external surface of the Eyes, and adds to the beauty of the Face. The Sense of Smelling is performed by means of the Nerves dispersed upon the Schneiderian Membrane

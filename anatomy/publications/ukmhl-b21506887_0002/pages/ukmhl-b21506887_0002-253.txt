Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &g. In strong Inspirations, additional Muscles ar^ brought into action, as the Scaleni, Serrati Postici Superiores, Serrati Magni, and Pectorales Minores. Expiratio7i is performed in consequence of a r^laxa,- tion of the Muscles which dilate the Thorax,—of the contraction of the Abdominal and a few other Muscles, assisted in strong Expirations chiefly by the Triangu- lares Sterni, Sacro-lumbales, and Serrati Postici Infe- riores,—of the elasticity of the Cartilages of the Ribs, ^nd the elasticity and contractile nature of the Bronchi, by all which circumstances the Cavity of the Thorax is diminished, and the Air is expelled from the Lungs. Upon the alternate states of Inspiration and Expi- ration depend the formation of the Voice, the sensation of Smell, and all the other functions of the Body :— But the great and principal office of the Lungs, which was formerly supposed to be that of cooling the Blood overheated by friction, is, during Respiration, to make such changes upon that Fluid as may be necess^ary for Animal life. Air that has been expired diifers from Atmospheric Air, in having less Oxygen, and in containing Carbonic Acid Gas; it is also charged with watery vapour. The quantity of Air taken at every Inspiration has been differently estimated by different Authors; by some it is rated at 40, while others make it as low as 14 cubic inches. The quantity must vary with thjS size of the Thorax, and state of the Lungs. According to some, it appears,—that the Venous Blood passing to the Lungs, of a dark red or purple colour, is charged with Carbon or Hydrogen;—that while circulating upon the Bronchial Cells, part of the

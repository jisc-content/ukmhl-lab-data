^68 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. dies, of a dark yellow colour, lying in the upper and back part of the Abdomen. They are situated at the upper, inner, and fore part of the Kidneys, having a concavity which corresponds with the rounded edges of these Organs. They lie over the large Psoae Muscles and Diaphragm, and higher than the Renal Vessels. They are of an irregular figure, somewhat triangular, and are about a couple of inches in length, but much larger proportionally in a Foetus than in an Adult; in the latter case being only about a fifteenth part of the size of the Kidney. The right one is connected to the Liver, the left to the Spleen and Pancreas, and both to the small Muscle of the Diaphragm, and to the Psoae Muscles and Kid- ^^yj by Cellular Substance. They are likewise re- tained in their place by numerous Vessels and Nerves which are spread over them. They are surrounded by Cellular Texture, which is part of the Tunica Adiposa of the Kidneys, and have a thin proper Coat, which adheres firmly to them. Their inner parts are softer than the outer, are of a brown colour, and can be easily separated from the outer, after which the Glands have the appearance of being real Capsules. They are frequently observed to be hollo\^, and to contain a dark-coloured Bilious- like matter, which is considered by many Anatomists as the Internal very Vascular and tender parts melted down by Putrefaction. Â« Their Arteries come from those of the adjacent parts, particularly from the Renal, and also from the Aorta and Diaphragmatic Arteries,

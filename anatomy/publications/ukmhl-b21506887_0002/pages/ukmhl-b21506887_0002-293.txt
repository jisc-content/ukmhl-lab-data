Part IV,] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 243 Nerves which go into the Liver, and transmits the Bi- liary Ducts and deep-seated Absorbents out from it. The Depresdon, between the Great Lobe and Lobu- lus SpiGELii, for the passage of the Inferior Vena Cava, which has frequently a Bridge over it, forming it into a Canal. A Small Depression, called Fossa Ductus Venosiy continued from the FossaUmbilicalis, between the Left Lobe and Lobulus Spigelii, running a little obliquely from right to left side, and receiving a Ligament, for- merly a branch of the Umbilical Vein in the Foetus. The Liver is connected to the Body by different Pro- cesses, termed its Ligaments ; all of which, excepting one, are formed by Doublings of the Peritoneum, viz. The lAgamentum Latum, vel Suspensorium Hepatis, placed between the Right and Left Lobes above, and extending below into the Fossa Umbilicalis. The Ligamentum Latum is fixed obliquely to the Diaphragm and tip of the Ensiform Cartilage, and then descends in the same oblique direction, adhering to the inner edge of the Vagina of the Rectus Abdo- minis of the right side, as far as the Umbilicus. The Ligamentum Rotundum, which was the Umbilical Vein in the Foetus, placed in a doubling of the under part of the Ligamentum Latum, and fixed to the Umbilicus. These two Ligaments have been supposed to resem- ble a Falx, with the edge turned uppermost, from which circumstance the Ligamentum Latum is some- times also called Falc'iforme. The Ligamentum Coronarium, considered by some as merely Cellular Substance, and by others as a reflec- tion of the Peritoneum, or both.â€”It unites the root Q 2

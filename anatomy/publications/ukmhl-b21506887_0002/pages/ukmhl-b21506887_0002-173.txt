Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. ISl I g some rare cases they have two. They somewhat re- semble the Tusks of Carnivorous Quadrupeds, espe- cially those of the Dog tribe, from which they have got their name. The two of the Upper Jaw are a little larger and longer, and have their roots more crooked than those of the Under one. In the Upper Jaw, they are placed immediately un- der the Orbitar Plates, and are termed Eye-Teeth, from a supposed connexion with the Eyes. The two below are placed almost as deep as the Base of the Bone, and are called Angular Teeth, from supporting the Angles of the Mouth. The Bicuspidati, formerly termed Small Molares, or First and Second Grinders, are situated behind the Cuspidati, and bear an intermediate resemblance to these and the Molares. Viewed in the Jaws, they are somewhat like each other, and not unlike the Cuspidati. The body of each has two points upon the middle of its grinding Sur- face, one external, the other internal; and those in the Upper Jaw are nearly upon a level. In the Under Jaw, the points project most on the outside of the Teeth. The Enamel is nearly equal in thickness round the Body of the Tooth, but is thinner at the sides than on the Cuspidati. The Fangs resemble two Fangs united, with a de- pression between them; sometimes, however, the Bi- cuspidati of the Upper Jaw have distinct roots. The Bicuspidati of the Under Jaw are smaller than those of the Upper one, the points on their grinding

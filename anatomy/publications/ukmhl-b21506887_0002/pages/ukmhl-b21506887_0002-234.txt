184 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Proper Auricle is somewhat less capacious than that on the right side; but the Sinus is so much larger as to render the two common Cavities,of the right and left Auricles nearly equal. The two Auricles have a slight Groove between them externally, and a thin Fleshy Septum within, formed by their opposite sides, in which, as has been already mentioned, there is a Foramen Ovale in a Foetus ;â€” but in an Adult the Partition is generally perfect, leaving merely the vestige of the Valve which belonged to this Passage, and which is distinguished from the rest of the Septum, by its greater degree of transpa- rency, being only about the thickness of a wafer. From the under part of the Sinus Venosus, a Cir- cular Passage, termed Auricular Orifice of this Ven- tricle, leads down to the posterior part of the base of the Cavity of the Left Ventricle. This is opposite to a Groove seen externally between the Auricle and Ven- tricle, and is about the same size with that of the right Auricular Orifice. The Left Auricle receives the Blood from the Pul- monary Veins, and, by its Muscular contraction, drives it to the Left Ventricle, out of which it is prevented from returning, by a Valve in the Ventricle, called Mifralis, The Left or Aortic Ventricle is situated in the poste- rior and left part of the Heart, and is somewhat of an egg shape. Its sides are about three times thicTcer and stronger than those of the Right Ventricle ; the thickness being in proportion to the force required to propel the Blood to the most remote parts of the Body.

S65 Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. especially on the Surface of the Kidney. They are much larger than those of the Artery, but correspond with them in their course.—They form a large Trunk on each side, which lies anterior to the corresponding Artery, and runs transversely to the Cava; the left, which is the longer, passing across the fore part of the Aorta. The Lymphatics of the Kidney run from without in- wards, and terminate in the Lumbar Glands, and after- wards in the Thoracic Duclt.—The Superficial Lym- phatics are so small as seldom to be seen, excepting in the diseased state of this Organ. The Nerves are from the Semilunar Ganglion, form- ed by the Great Sympathetic and Eighth*Pairs. They compose a Plexus which surrounds the Blood-vessels, and accompanies them in the Kidney. From the minute extremities of the Renal Artery, in the Corpuscles situated in the Cortical Substance, the Urinifei'ous Tubes arise. They are mixed with some extremely small Blood-vessels, and constitute the Medullary Substance of the Kidney. By degrees they unite into larger Tubes, which run in a radiated manner, the direction being from the outer edge or circumference, towards the Sinus or in- ner part of the Kidney. The radiated Tubes, becoming still larger in their passage, terminate in the Papillce, which are of a com- pressed conical form, and at a little distance from each other. The Papillce are twelve or more in each Kidney, the number varying according to that of the original Lobes of which the Kidney is composed, and likewise from

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. place^ and forming a Cavity or Pouch between it and the Testicle. The under part of it becomes more firmly attached to the Body of the Testicle, and forms the Cauda, or Globus Minor, It is then turned backwards upon it- self, after which it sends out the Excretory Duct of the Testicle. The Body of the Testis has numerous Arteries, Veins, Absorbents, and Nerves ; but is principally composed of a collection of minute, tender, elastic Tubes, intricately convoluted,^ termed Tubuli Seminu Jeri, vel Vasa Seminalia, -The Tubuli Seminijeri are disposed in Fasciculi or Bundles, between Septulce or Partitions, which are formed of Blood-vessels and Cellular Substance. These Septulse begin at the root or Nucleus, some- times termed Corpus Highmorianum, situated at the back part of the Testicle, and extend in a radiated manner to the Tunica Albuginea. The Testis is fixed behind by its Vessels, which are collected in a Cord termed Spermatic, but is loose and free before, to prevent it from being pinched. The Spermatic Cord, strictly so called, extends ob- liquely from the Ring of the Obliquus Externus to the Body of the Testis, the obliquity being somewhat in proportion to the width of the Pelvis. It is composed of the Trunks of the different Vessels belonging ta the Testicle, and of a quantity of Cellular Substance, The Cord is covered by the Cremaster, and within it, by the same Processof the Peritoneum which forms the Tunica Vaginalis Testis, and which is here called the Tunica Vaginalis of the Spermatic Cord. In this

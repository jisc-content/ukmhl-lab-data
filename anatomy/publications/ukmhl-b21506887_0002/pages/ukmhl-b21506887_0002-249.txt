Paut IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 199 The Bronchij at their beginnings, have the same kind of Cartilages with the Trachea, but after they enter the Lungs, each Cartilaginous Ring is divided into two or three pieces, which, however, are so con- nected to each other, as to go completely round the Bronchi, and keep the Passage open, and free from compression. Upon tracing the smaller divisions of the Bronchi, the Cartilages are observed to become less numerous, and more separated from each other, till at length they va- nish ; the Capillary Branches becoming entirely Mem- branous, as well as the Vesicles in which they terminate. The Trachea has several Coats entering into its com- position, some for strengthening it, others for giving it a certain degree of motion, viz. A Cellular Coat^ which, in the Thorax, is covered by the Mediastinum; An Elastic Ligamentous Coat, which passes along the Trachea, and also upon the different Branches in the Substance of the Lungs, adding much to the elasticity of these; A Muscular Coat, placed between the Cartilages and in the back part of the Trachea, and composed of Cir- cular Fibres without, and Longitudinal Fibres within ; â€”the former for straitening, the latter for shortening the general Passage. The Longitudinal Fibres are collected into Bundles, which are distinctly seen through the inner Coat, and may be traced considerably farther than the Cartilages in the Substance of the Lungs. A very Vascular and Irritable Membrane, continued from the Mouth, v/hich lines the inner side of the Tra-

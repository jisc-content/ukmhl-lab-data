58 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. fixed to it, that it has been considered by many Ana- tomists as a continuation of the same substance; but it differs from the Cornea, in the following particulars: —it is opake, and of a pure white colour ; is formed of elastic Fibres running in every direction, and closely interwoven with each other, and is not divisible into Layers. It is thicker in its posterior than anterior part, and receives a little tinge, on the inner Surface, from the Choroid Coat, with which it is in contact. It has few Blood-vessels when compared with the Choroides, and does not possess very acute sensibility. It gives form and strength to the Eye, attachment to its Muscles, and protects and supports the tender parts it incloses. It has also been conjectured, and Blumenbach thinks he has ascertained from Compara- rative Anatomy the truth of the conjecture, that this Coat, by its structure, is so affected by the action of the Muscles, as to influence what are called the Inter- nal Changes of the Eye; by which the form of the Eye- ball, consequently the length of its Axis, and the re- spective situation of the Lens, are adjusted according to the proximity or remoteness of the object. The Tendons of the four Recti Muscles of the Eye are fixed to the fore part of the Tunica Sclerotica. These, or the Cellular Vaginae covering them, have been supposed to give an additional whiteness to the Eye, and the part giving this whiteness has been term- ed Tunica Alhuginea:—But the Sclerotic Coat is every where of a pure white, and can receive little additional brightness from any such covering.

216 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt IV. The second Plane is chiefly transverse or circular, and considerably thicker and stronger than the other. Its Fibres are intersected by many small, white. Ten- dinous-like Lines;â€”these, however, are in a great mea- sure formed of that Cellular Substance by which the two Coats are united. The Muscular Coat assists in the Digestion of the Food, by giving a gentle motion to the Stomach, ac- cording to the direction of its Fibres; the one set short- ening it, the other rendering it narrower, and both sets accommodating themselves to the quantity of contained Aliment. The Pylorus is formed by a doubling of the two in- ner Coats, which project into the Passage between the Stomach and Intestines, and contain a Circular Mus- cle, called Sphincter Pylori. The Pylorus varies considerably in different persons, being sometimes circular, at other times oval; in some it is thick, in others it is thinner, which gives, of course, a diff*erence in appearance to the Orifice it forms. The Pylorus, by contracting, prevents the grosser indigested parts of the Aliment from escaping, and, by dilating, allows the Pulpy digested part to pass to the Intestines. The Third Coat, commonly called Nervous, some- times Vascular, but properly Cellular, consists of a large quantity of fine Cellular Substance without Fat, and is intermixed with and supported by, small Aponeurotic- like Filaments, which cross each other obliquely, but which are also of a Cellular nature. This Coat, which, like the corresponding one in the Esophagus, has been compared by some Authors to the

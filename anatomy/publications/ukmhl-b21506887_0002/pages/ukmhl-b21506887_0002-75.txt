The JEtes, which constitute the Organ of Vision, are situated in the Cavities of the Orbits, and are sur- rounded by several parts, some of which protect them from injury, and others assist in the performance of their various motions. The Orbits are of a conical figure, situated in the fore part of the Cranium, with their Apices behind, their Axes in a horizontal direction, and their Bases turned obliquely outwards. They are formed of different Processes of the fol- lowing Bones, viz. The upper part of each Orbit, by the Orbitar plate of the Frontal Bone;—the inferior, by the Orbitar Plates of the superior Maxillary and Malar Bones ;— the internal, chiefly by the Orbitar part of the Os Un- guis and Pars Plana of the Ethmoid Bone;—the exter- nal, by the Orbitar Plates of the Sphenoid and Malar Bones;—the posterior, by the Sphenoid and Palate Bones;—and the anterior edge of the Orbit, by the Frontal, Superior Maxillary, and Malar Bones. The Cavities of the Orbits are lined with Produc-

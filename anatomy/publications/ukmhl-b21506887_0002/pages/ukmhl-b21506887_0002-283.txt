Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 233 By this extension of the inner Surface of the Intes- tines, sufficient space is afforded for the absorption of the Chyle, and for the secretion of those Fluids which assist in the digestion of the Food, and in the lubrica- tion of the Canal. One edge of these Plicae is fixed to the Intestine, the other is loose. They are much deeper than the Rugae of the Stomach, and placed opposite to the Interstices of each other, and are of different lengths, not form- ing entire Circles. The Villi of the Inner Coat are much more conspi- cuous than in the Stomach, being composed not only of the extremities of Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, but particularly of the Mouths of Lacteal Vessels, the Ori- gins of which, however, are extremely small, and have a fungous appearance. Numerous Ducts of Simple and Compound Glands terminate on this Coat, for the secretion of Mucus. The former are called Solitary^ and the latter Con-^ gregate; and, from their Describers, Glandules Peyeei, and Glandulce Brunneri. They are in the form of Papillae, but so minute as seldom to be seen, excepting in a diseased state though they are supposed to be dispersed over the whole of the Canal. They are seated in the Substance of the Nervous at, and serve to discharge that Matter, which, while it prevents the acrimony of the Aliments from injur- ing the Intestines, enables them to discharge their Contents.

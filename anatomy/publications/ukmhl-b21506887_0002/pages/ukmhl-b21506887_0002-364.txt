At the anterior extremity of the Penis, the Integu- ments form a loose Fold, termed Prepuce^ which covers the part called Claris, when the Penis is in a state of relaxation. The Prepuce is connected to the anterior and under part of the GlanSj by a triangular Fold named Frwnum Preputii, which serves as a Ligament. The Corpora Cavernosa Penis resemble two equal but irregular Cylinders, or rather Portions of Cylin- ders, closely applied to the sides of each other, and each covered by a strong, elastic.

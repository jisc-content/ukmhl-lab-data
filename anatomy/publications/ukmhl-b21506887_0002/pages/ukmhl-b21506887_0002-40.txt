COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, which run in general in a parallel and transverse direc- tion ; and by plunging a part of the Medullary Sub- stance of the Brain, for a few minutes, into boiling oil, or macerating it for a longer period in alcohol, or in some of the diluted acids, &c. so as to render it firmer and more elastic, it may be made, by lacerating it in some particular direction, to exhibit a fibrous appear- ance. Something of the same kind may be seen in the Cortical part, but it is probably not so distinct. In many parts of the Cineritious Substance, Me- dullary Matter appears; and, on the contrary, in dif- ferent parts of the Medullary Substance, Cineritious Matter is found ; the two being frequently blended to- gether in the form of Streaks.â€”aS'^^ Monro on the Ner- vous System. Centrum Ovale of Vieussens. This is the Medul- lary Substance of the Brain, forming a kind of Nucle- us, which is seen after removing the Cineritious Sub- stance, and all the Medullary parts mixed with it which lie between the Cortical Convolutions. To obtain a proper view of the Centrum Ovale, the Nucleus ought to be cut m such a manner as to pre- serve the Corpus Caliosum, and the same convexity with that of the general convexity of the Brain. The Centrum Ovale forms an Arch or Roof over the two Lateral Ventricles; and the under part of this Hoof, which is smooth and uniform, constitutes the upper part of the Ventricles. Vieussens considered the Centrum Ovale as the Great Dispensatory of the Animal Spirits. In the Substance of the Brain, there are four Cavi-

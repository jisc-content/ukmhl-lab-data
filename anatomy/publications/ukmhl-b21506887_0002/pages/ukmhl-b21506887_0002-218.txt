170 COMPENDIUM OF AISTATOMY. [Part IV. which it forms several angles, which have been termed Cornua of the Pericardium. While the External Layer is reflected to cover the parts which surround it, the Internal is also reflected, first over the roots of the large Blood-vessels, and then over the Heart, to form the proper covering of that Organ ; in the same manner as the Tunica Conjunctiva is reflected from the Eye-lids to cover the fore part of the Eye; or, strictly speaking, the Heart lies behind, or on the outside of the Pericardium. From the ends of the Extreme Arteries upon its Sur- face, a Fluid, called Liquor Pericardii^ is discharged, by which it is lubricated, and the effects of friction di- minished. The Liquor Pericardii is commonly found, after death, in the quantity of a few Drachms, though not unfrequentiy of one or two Ounces. According to the experiments of Dr Bostock, it is composed of Water, with a small proportion of Albu- men, Mucus, and Muriate of Soda. It is redder in a young Subject than in a Person ad- vanced in life, in whom it becomes paler, or more of a straw colour. The Arteries of the fore part of the Pericardium are from the Internal Mammaries and Diaphragmatics; those of its back part from the Bronchials and Esopha- geals. The Veins correspond with the Arteries, and have the same names. The Nerves of this Membrane are not obvious to the Senses. The Pericardium preserves the Heart in situ; pre-

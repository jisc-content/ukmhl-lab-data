36 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. diately before the Anterior Crura of the Fornix, there is a white Medullary Cord, which runs transversely through the Corpora Striata, and then downwards, having the name of Commissura Cerebri Anterior. At the back part of the third Ventricle, and under the root of the Pineal Gland, there is another Cord si- milar to the former, but shorter, called Commissura Cerebri Posterior. The Commissurse Cerebri assist in uniting the two sides of the Brain together. From the under and back part of the third Ventri- cle, there is a Passage which leads to the fourth, under the name of Iter ad Quartum Ventriculum, Canalis Me- dius, vel Aquceductiis Sylvii. After the posterior part of the Fornix, and the Tela Choroidea to which it adheres, have been removed, there appear at the back part of the third Ventricle, behind the Thalami, and over the Iter a Tertio ad Quartum Ventriculum, the Nates and Testes, or Tuber- cula Quadrigemina, or more properly Bigemina, and the Pineal Gland. The Nates, or Tuber cula Anterior a, are placed up- permost, and are of a rounder form than the Testes, or Tubercula Posteriora, which lie immediately under the former. The Testes are a little whiter in their colour than the Nates, and broader from one side to the other. A Longitudinal Section shews the Tubercula to be covered externally with a thin Medullary Lamina, and to be Cineritious within. In Man they are more nearly of an equal size and colour than in Quadrupeds, as in the Ox, Sheep, &c. \

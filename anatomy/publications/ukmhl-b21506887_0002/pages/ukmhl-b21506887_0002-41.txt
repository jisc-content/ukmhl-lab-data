Fart IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 29 ties, termed Ventricles^ viz. two Lateral^ a Third and a Fourths The four Ventricles have their sides contiguous to each other, are chiefly formed of Medullary Matter, and are lined with a continuation of the Pia Mater conducted in by the Blood-vessels, but differing from that part of the Membrane covering the exterior Sur- face of the Brain, in having fewer Vessels dispersed upon it. The Ventricles are constantly moistened by a Fluid, which prevents their opposite sides from adhering to each other. The Use of the Ventricles, as of many other parts of the Brain, is still unknown. The Lateral, formerly called Stiperior Ventricles, are situated in the Hemispheres, one in each. They are of an irregular form, lying under the Cen- trum Ovale, and have each three winding Corners, compared by Haller to Rams' Horns, which are there- fore called by him Cornua, and the Cavities themselves Ventriculi Tricornes. Each of the Cornua is placed in a corresponding Lobe of the Brain. The Anterior Cornua are separated from each other only by a partition, called Septum Lucidum. The Posterior Cornua, called also Digital Cavities, are at a considerable distance from each other, but ap- proach nearer at their pointed extremities. The Anterior and Posterior Cornua run nearly in a horizontal direction, or according to the length of the Hemispheres themselves ; while the Inferior pass first downwards, then forwards, and terminate in the Late- ral Lobes of the Brain,

Pabt IV.] OF THE VISCERA, Sec. 7 lies immediately under the Corpus Mucosum, and gives a covering to the whole Body. It is formed of Fibres intimately interwoven, and running in every direction like the hairs in the felt of a hat, and is so plentifully supplied with Nerves and Blood-vessels, that the smallest puncture cannot be made in any part of it, without occasioning pain and a discharge of Blood. The Blood-vessels of the Cutis are so numerous, espe- cially on its outer Surface, as to appear to form almost the whole of its Substance, and are of such a size as to be inj exited with facility. It is strong and very elastic, and may be elongated in every direction, after which it recovers its former dimensions. It forms the Body and strongest portion of the Skin, and is that part in Quadrupeds of which Leather is made. The outer part of it is dense and firm, the inner loose, gradually degenerating into the common Cellular Sub- stance. It is thicker and looser on the posterior than on, the anterior part of the Body, and thicker and firmer in the Palms and Soles than in the other parts of the ex- tremities. The colour of the Cutis also differs in different parts of the Body, in proportion to the quantity of Blood in the extreme Vessels, and to the thinness of the Cu- ticle. At the edge of the Eye-lids, the red part of the Lips, and margin of the Amis, the Cutis becomes so imme- diately and remarkably thin, fis to appear to be lost.

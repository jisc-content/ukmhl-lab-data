Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 18T This Partition prevents any direct communication between the two Ventricles. Opposite to the outer edge of the Septum, both upon the upper and under Surfaces of the Heart, there is a Groove^ which distinguishes the two Ventricles from each other, and in which some of the principal Trunks of the Coronary Vessels are situated. At the fore and right side of the Valvula Mitralis, and behind the beginning of the Pulmonary Artery, there is a Round Opening, which is the Mouth of the Aorta, and which is nearly of the same size with that of the Pulmonary Artery. Under this opening, the Surface of the Ventricle be- comes smooth and equal, having none of the Columnse Carneae, which are seen on the other parts of the sides of its Cavity. The Left Ventricle receives- the Blood sent to it from the Auricle, and, by a contraction similar to, but much stronger than that of the Right Ventricle, propels it to the Aorta. At the Mouth of the Aorta, there are three Semilur- nar Valves, with their Corpuscula Arantii, perfectly similar to those of the Pulmonary Artery,—but some- what stronger. On the outside of the Semilunar Valves, are the Su nuses of Valsalva, resembling those of the Pulmonary Artery,—but a little more prominent. The Semilunar Valves are pressed back by the Blood, the reflux of which they prevent during the contrac- tion of the Aorta.—They are returned towards the sides of the Aorta, in the same manner, and from the same cause, as those in the Pulmonary Artery.

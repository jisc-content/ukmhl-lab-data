g58 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Pancreas is covered anteriorly by the two Layers of the root of the Meso-colon, which assist in retaining it in its place;â€”posteriorly, it is only covered by Cel- lular Substance, which connects it to the Vertebrae. It is of a pale red colour, bordering upon yellow, and is composed of minute Granulae termed its Acini, which form small Glands or Lobes, that are connected loosely by Cellular Texture, in such a manner as to give an appearance of uniformity and smoothness to its External Surface. By a good Injection, each of the Acini is found to be composed of an assemblage of Blood-vessels, and of the origins of Excretory Tubes. The Arteries of the Pancreas are derived, partly from the Hepatic, but chiefly from the Splenic, by se- veral small Branches, which pass at various places into its Substance, in a transverse direction. The Veins correspond in name and general course with the Arteries, and assist in forming the Vena Porta?. The Lymphatics run to the Splenic Plexus, and ter- minate in the Thoracic Duct. The Nerves of the Pancreas are small. Like those of the other Viscera of the Abdomen, they are derived from the Great Sympathetic and Eighth Pairs. From the different Acini of the Pancreas, small Ducts arise, which join into larger ones, running trans- versely in the Substance of the Pancreas, nearly in the same Plane, and forming a common Duct, called Duc- tus Pancreaticus. The Pancreatic Duct, termed also Ductus VI^ikt- suNGi, after the Discoverer of it in the tluman Body,

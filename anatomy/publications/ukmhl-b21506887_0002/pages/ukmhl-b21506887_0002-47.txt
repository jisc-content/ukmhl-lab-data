The Third Ventricle is in form of a deep Fissure, placed between the inner ends of the Thalami Optici, having the Commissura Mollis of these Thalami situat- ed above, the Crura Cerebri below, and the Bodies of the Thalami on each side. The Infundihulum, formed of a Cineritious and Me- dullary Substance, is a passage of considerable size, which leads downwards and forwards, from the anterior part of the Third Ventricle; gradually contracting, and becoming solid at its under end, where it termi- nates in the Glandula Piiuitaria, and thus, contrary to the opinion of the Ancients, preventing the passage of any Pituitous Fluid from it to the Nose.

It has been already mentioned, how- ever, that the Infundibulum is impervious at its under end, and the real use of this Gland, as well as of the other Tubercles of the Brain, seems still unknowil.

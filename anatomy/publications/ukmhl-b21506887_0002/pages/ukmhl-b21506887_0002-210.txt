162 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV; It is composed of a tough Cellular, or Ligamentous Substance, which incloses the Lactiferous Tubes, and which is so elastic, that after the part is drawn out or distended, it readily recovers its former dimension, when the cause of distension is removed. Upon the Apex of the Nipple, the Orifices of the Lactiferous Ducts appear, which are of the same num- ber with the Ducts that enter its base. Around the Nipple, there is a Circle or Disk, called Areola,—nearly of the same colour with that of the Nipple itself. The colour here, however, varies at different times of life,—being florid in Girls, of a pale brown in Women more advanced in life, and in old age dull and livid. During Pregnancy, it is of a darker colour than at other times, in consequence of a change which takes place in the Corpus Mucosum which forms it. Under the Skin of the Areola, there are numerous Sebaceous Glands, or Follicles, the orifices of which dis- charge an oily Mucus, to defend the Nipple and Areola around it, and prevent them from being excoriated. The Arteries of the Mamma are partly from the In- ternal, and partly from the External Mammaries ; the former of which are sent off from the Subclavian, and the latter from the Axillary Artery ;—the Branches entering the Mamma at different places. The Veins accompany the Arteries, and are distin- guished by the same name. The Absorbents, like the Blood-vessels of the Mam- ma, are numerous. The greater part of them pass through the Axillary Glands; others penetrate the In- terstices of the Ribs, near the Sternum, and enter the

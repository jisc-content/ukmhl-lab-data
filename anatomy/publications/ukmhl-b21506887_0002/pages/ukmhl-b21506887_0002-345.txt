Part IV ] OF THE VISCERA, kc m Of the principal Veins, the Right goes to the Vena Cava, and the Left to the Renal Vein. The Lymphatics go chiefly to those of the Kidneys. The Nerves come principally from the Renal Plexus. No Excretory Ducts have been discovered to belong to them. The Renal Glands have been supposed to furnish Lymph for the dilution of the Blood returning in the Renal Veins, after the secretion of the Urine; Or, to restore to the Blood of the Vena Cava, the ir^ ritable parts lost in the secretion of the Urine and Bile : Or, to convey something useful to the Thoracic Duct : Or, in a Foetus, to divert the Blood from the Kidneys, and thereby lessen the quantity of Urine. But their use is still undiscovered ; though it is sup- posed, from their vicinity to the Kidneys, not only in Man, but in many other Animals, that they are sub- servient to these Organs, particularly in the Foetus; yet in one case, where the Kidneys were placed much lower than usual, the Renal Glands were observed by the Au- thor to have their ordinary situation in the Abdomen, VESICA URINARIA. The Vesica Urinaria^ or Bladder of Urine, is a large Musculo-membranous Sac situated in the Pelvis, in the bottom of the Hypogastric Region. it is placed in the Fore Part of the Pelvis, behind the Ossa Pubis,â€”before the upper, and above the un- der portion of the Intestinum Rectum. When completely empty, as is sometimes the case, but by no means always, in those who have suffered a

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 127 by age, the Cavity in old people often filling up with Osseous Matter, and the Teeth acquiring a horny trans- parency ;—or where, in some Animals, as the Horse, a Tooth is v/anting, and the corresponding Tooth of the opposite J aw extends so far as to fill the space former- ly occupied by the body of the absent Tooth, when the Jaws are closed;—by accident, as when a Tooth is loosened by a blow, the Tooth being sometimes fixed again in its Socket, at other times becoming black, from its nourishing Vessels being destroyed;—by dis- ease, as Exostosis, or in Anchylosis of the Roots of the Teeth, or in some rare cases, of the Roots of one Tooth to those next it; but especially by the Blood which is observed by Dentists to issue from the Cavity of the Teeth in sawing them across, for the purpose of fixing other Teeth.

In the Upper Jaw, the Nerves enter through various parts of the Ossa Maxillaria Superiora. In the Under Jaw, the Trunk which furnishes the Dental Nerves is lodged in the inferior Maxillary Canal. The Nerves which supply the Teeth, though small, can be observed to enter the Foramina at the points of the Fangs, and, by properly preparing the Teeth, can be distinctly traced in their Osseous Canals. In a Foetus the Nerves can be observed first to form a Plex- us, and then to penetrate into the Pulp of the Teeth. The Absorbents of the Teeth have not been seen, but their existence is proved,—by the Absorption of

The Scrotum^ whic!i furnishes an External Covering to the Testes, is a continuation of the Common Integu- ments ; has the same structure with the Skin in gene- ral ; but is more plentifully supplied with Sebaceous Follicles; has no Fat in its Cellular Substance, and is occasionally relaxed and corrugated in a greater de- gree than the Skin in the outer parts of the Body, in consequence of its very intimate connexion with the Cremaster. Upon the Surface of the Scrotum, there is a Super- ficial, longitudinal, projecting Line, which divides it into two equal parts, and has the name of Raphe. The Inner Surface of the Scrotum is lined with Cel- lular Substance, which is firmer and more Vascular than in other places. The Cellular Substance of 'Lhe Scrotum, in conse- quence of its redness.

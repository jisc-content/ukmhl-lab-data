Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 37 in which the Nates are large, round, and of a brown colour, and the Testes small and long, and have a white appearance. Over the Nates, and connected to them by a thin Medullary Lamina, and under the back part of the Fornix, is placed the Glandula Pinealis, which is of a Cineritious nature, about the size of a Garden-pea, and of a Conoid Figure, placed almost horizontally, with its point backwards ; obtaining its name from its re- semblance in shape to a Pine or Fir-cone. In consequence of its being always present, and sel- dom found in a diseased state, it has been celebrated by Des Cartes as the Seat of the Soul. The Pineal Gland is fixed by its root to the Com- missura Cerebri Posterior, and sends out two long Me^ dullary Peduncles, or Foot-stalks, to be fixed to the up- per and inner side of the Thalami, and the Anterior Crura of the Fornix. Near, or in the Substance of the Pineal Gland, small Calcareous Concretions are frequently found; some- times they are grouped together over the Base of the Gland, and then form the Acervulus Cerebri of Soem- MERRING. They are not met with till after the age of puberty, and do not appear to be the efi'ects of disease. - Cerebellum. The Cerehellum is situated in the Inferior Fossae of the Occipital Bone, under the Posterior Lobes of the Cerebrum, and is separated from these Lobes by the Tentorium.

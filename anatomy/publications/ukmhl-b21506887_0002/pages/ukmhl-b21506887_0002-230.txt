180 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. the Heart, small round Tendinous Cords are sent off, which uniting, form a number of Cords of an utiequal size. The Cliordce Tendmece descend obliquely within the Ventricle in the same direction with the Valve from which they arise. They are fixed to the extremities of a few strong Columnce Carnece, termed here also Musculi Papillares, which are joined by their other ends to the correspond- ing sides of the Ventricle; the anterior and largest being on the fore part, and the other two on the poste- rior and inferior sides of that Cavity. Besides the three principal portions of the Valve, it has some Ten- dinous Cords, and Fleshy Pillars of inferior size, fixed in the same manner with the rest. The Tricuspid Valve prevents the reflux of the Blood to the Auricle, during the contraction of the Ventricle, the Blood at this time insinuating itself be- tween the Walls of the latter and the Valve, The Tendinous Cords are of such a length as to al- low the Valve to be laid against the sides of the Ven- tricle, in the distended state of this Organ, but admit it to be pushed back by the Blood, until a complete Septum or Partition is formed at the Mouth of the Ventricle, during the contraction of the latter.â€”The Papillae, by their contraction, prevent the Valve from being pushed into the Auricle. The Valve is opened, and pressed back against the sides of the Ventricle, by the Blood, in its passage from the Auricle. The upper and left side of the Ventricle becomes smooth and uniform, and leads to a large Opening a-

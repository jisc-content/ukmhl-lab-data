Pakt IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 91 the Processes, and is then called the longest of the three. It forms an angle with the Neck, is slightly compressed, becomes gradually smaller, and is bent at its extremity towards the Membrana Tympani. In the natural situation, the Head of the Malleus is turned upwards and inwards, and the Handle down upon the Membrana Tympani, to which it adheres. The Incus, compared in shape to an Anvil, but more resembling one of the Dentes Molares with its roots widely separated, is situated behind the Malleus, and is formed of a Body and two Crura, one of which is termed the Short or Superior, and the other the Long or Inferior Crus. The Body has a Cavity and two Eminences, corre- sponding to the back part of the head of the Malleus, with which it is articulated. The short Crus extends backwards, and is joined by a Ligament to the edge of the Mastoid Opening. The long Crus, which is smaller than the other, is turned downwards, with the point a little flattened, and bent inwards. The Os Orhiculare, vel Lenticulare, is the smallest Bone of the Body, being considerably less than a grain of Mustard-seed. It is articulated with the point of the Long Process of the Incus, and is so firmly fixed to it, that it has been frequently considered as a Process of that Bone. The Stapes is named from a striking resemblance it has to a Stirrup. It is divided into Head, Crura, and Base. The Head is placed upon a small flat Neck, and is articulated with the Os Orbiculare.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. S2l five inches in length, and it has acquired so much ad- ditional size and weight, that it is found lower than formerly in the Cavity of the Pelvis ; in consequence of which, the Os Tineas is felt projecting nearer to the Os Externum Uteri. After this time, its bulk increasing, it presses against the Pelvis, and ascends in the Abdomen, carrying the Os Tincse higher than its original situation; at the same time elongating the Vagina. In the fifth Month, the Uterus renders the Abdomen tense, and forms a sort of Ball between the Pubes and Umbilicus. In the sixth month, it extends about four inches above the Pubes, the length varying according to that of the Abdomen and Ovum. It continues to rise through the whole remaining pe- riod of Gestation ; and after ascending above the Pel- vis, it commonly inclines, with its Fundus forwards, the Os Tincae backwards, and is frequently also turned a little to one side ; but the ascent is observed to be more in the first, and the inclination gijeater in the later Gestations, owing to the nature of the Integuments of the Abdomen, less resistance being made by them after a Woman has born a num|)er of Children. The position of the Uterus also varies according to the height of a person, and the width of the Pelvis. In the seventh Month it reaches the Umbilicus; in the eighth is half way between that and the Sternum. At last it touches the Scrobiculus Cordis, Stomach, and Colon, being now about a foot in length from the upper to the under extremity ; occupying almost the whole of the Umbilical and Epigastric Regions, and having VOL II.

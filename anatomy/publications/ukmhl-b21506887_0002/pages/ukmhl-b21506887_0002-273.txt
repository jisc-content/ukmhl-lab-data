Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Mesentery, but in such a manner that they are allowed to float in the Cavity of the Abdomen, and to give way to the Stomach in proportion as it becomes distended. Great Intestines. The Great, like the Small Intestines, form one con- tinued Canal, which tapers from its upper to near its under extremity ; but they differ from them in being considerably wider, shorter, and straighter,—in being irregular on their outer Surface, and tacked up into Cells,—and in having many Processes upon them, termed AppendiculcB PiriguedinoscB. They differ like- wise considerably in their internal appearance. Like the Small Intestines, also, they are divided into three parts, termed CcBcum, Colon, and Rectum. ^helntestinumCcBcum forms a Short Bag, only about three or four Inches in length, and nearly the same in diameter. The Caecum, strictly so called, is that part of the Intestine which lies under the insertion of the Ilium, though more frequently the dilated begin- ning of the Colon is distinguished by the same name. It is situated in the Right Iliac Region, resting on the Cavity of the corresponding Os Ilium, at the under end of the Right Kidney, and is concealed by the last Convolutions of the Ilium. The bottom of it is turned downwards, and forms a shut Sac; the mouth of which is directed towards the Colon. This Sac may be considered as forming the Ccecum Caput Coli. At the posterior and left side of the Caecum, there is a Small Process about the same length with the Caecum

30 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. In each of the Posterior Cornua there is an Elonga- tion, which terminates behind in a point, and which is called Ergot by the French, from its resemblance to the Spur of a Cock ; ^ or Hippocampus Minor^ from its similarity to, and connexion with, the Substance term- ed Hippocampus Major, In the fore part of the bottom of the Lateral Ventri- cles, are two Pyriform Eminences, called Corpora Stri- ata^ which are large and rounded before, where they occupy the whole Anterior Extremities of the Lateral Ventricles, but become gradually narrower, and recede from each other at their posterior extremities. Their inner edges are concave, and their upper sur- face is smooth and of a greyish colour. The Structure of these is mostly Cineritious exter- nally, but mixed with Medullary Stri^ within, some of which form large Transverse Medullary Arches, and others run more in a straight direction. Between the posterior halves of the Corpora Striata, are situated the Thalami Nervorum Opticorum^ which have a roundish form and a Medullary Surface, and have Striae of Cineritious and Medullary Matter inter- nally ; but the Striae are less distinct than those of the Corpora Striata. Upon the Surface of these Bodies, there are small Eminences or Tubercles, some of which are placed up- on their superior, and others upon their inferior ex- tremities, which have the name of Corpora Geniculata, and are called Anterior, Posterior, External or Inter- nal, according to their situations. The inner parts of the Thalami are flat and conti- guous ; and above, they are so closely connected as to form one continued Surface, called Commissuj^a Mol-

Pakt IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 339 From the Trunk of the Umbilical Vein, where it ter- minates in the Liver, a Branch called Ductus vel Ca- 7ialis Ve7iosus, runs in a somewhat waving direction, and joins the Left Vena Hepatica, where that Vein enters the Cava. The Ductus Venosus is much smaller than the Trunk of the Umbilical Vein, and carries part of the Blood of that Vein directly to the Heart, without al- lowing it to enter the Circulation in the Liver. The Umbilical Vein sends Branches to the Right Lobe of the Liver, but is principally distributed through the Left Lobe ; while the Right Branch of the Vena Portas carries the principal part of the Blood of the Splenic and Mesenteric Arteries to the Right Lobe of the Liver, a small portion only going to the Left Lobe by the corresponding Branch of the Vena Portse. After Birth, the Left Lobe of the Liver, which was formerly more particularly supplied by the Umbilical Vein, receives an additional proportion of Blood from the Vena Portarum. The reason why the Umbilical Vein goes partly to the Cava, and not entirely to the Heart, is not understood. The Pancreas, like the other Glandular Viscera, is also somewhat enlarged in size. The Kidneys are irregular on their Surface, being formed of Lobes, the number nearly corresponding with that of the Papillae in the Kidney of an Adult. Each of the Lobes consists of a Cortical and a Me- dullary part, with a Papilla, and is covered by a pro- per Membrane. The Glandulae Renales are almost as large as the Kid- neys, but afterwardsrather diminish than increase in size, Y 2

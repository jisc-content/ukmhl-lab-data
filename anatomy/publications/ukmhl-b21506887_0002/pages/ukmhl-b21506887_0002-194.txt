15^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. They are connected to each other, and to the adja- cent Cartilages, by different Muscles and Ligaments. The Arytenoid Cartilages form apart of the Opening called Glottis^ and give attachment to its Ligaments. The Epiglottis^ obtaining its name from its situation above the Glottis, is of an oval form when surrounded by its Ligaments and Membranes; but when divested of these, it is found to be narrow below, broad above, and rounded, and slightly notched, at its upper extre- mity. ^ It is convex towards the Tongue, and concave to- wards the Glottis, with its point reflected a little for- wards. It is placed behind the upper part of the Thyroid Cartilage, is situated obliquely over the Glottis, and may be seen and examined in the living Body, by pressing down the root of the Tongue. Its under end is fixed by a broad and short Liga- ment to the middle Notch of the Thyroid Cartilage ; laterally it is attached by two Ligaments to the whole length of the Arytenoid Cartilages, forming, at this part, the Superior Opening of the Larynx. It is fixed to the roots of the Os Hyoides and Tongue by a Ligament, which is the Doubling of the inner Membrane running along the middle of its anterior Surface, and forming the Froenum Epiglottidis, It is very elastic, and is much more pliable than the other Cartilages, being of a Cartilago-ligamentous na- ture. It is found to have a number of Fissures with La- cuncB in them, and to be perforated by numerous Fo- ramina, which are the Mouths of so many Mucous Fol-

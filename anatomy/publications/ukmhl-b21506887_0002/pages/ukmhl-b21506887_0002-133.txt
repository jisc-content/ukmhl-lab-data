Part IV.J OF THE VISCERA, &;c. 9$ sequence of the Bone, which is extremely thin, being broken while preparing it. In the back part of the inferior Fossula, four oi* five Cribriform Holes appear, for the transmission of Branches of that part of the Portio Mollis destined for the Vestibule and Semicircular Canals. In the upper Fossula of the Meatus Internus, there are two Passages^ one posterior and smaller, transmit- ting Nerves into the Elliptical Cavity of the Vestibule* The other, the anterior and larger, is termed Cana^ lis vel Aquceductus Fallopii,—from a resemblance it bears to an Italian Aqueduct; and serves for the trans- mission of the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair of NerveSi • The Canal of Fallopiits goes through the uppei* part of the Pars Petrosa, passes downwards and back- wards between the Fenestra Ovalis and external Semi- circular Canal, and terminates by the Foramen Stylo- mastoideum. In its passage through the Pars Petrosa, it commu- nicates with the Foramen Innominatum, situated on the upper and fore part of that Bone. In Children, the Labyrinth is almost as large as in Adults, its substance complete and hard, while the Bone which surrounds it is soft and spongy, on which account it is easily separated from the rest of the Pars Petrosa. The different Cavities and Passages of the Labyrinth are lined with the Periosteum, which in the Vestibule fills the Fenestra Ovalis, and of consequence covers the Base of the Stapes.

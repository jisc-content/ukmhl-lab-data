Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &g. 315 times comes from each Ovarium; at other times, the two come from one Ovarium only. Some days after Impregnation, an Ovum, consisting of a Vesicle filled with a limpid Fluid, is found in the Cavity of the Uterus. The Ovum, when first visible, is observed to have a smooth Surface, but in a short time thereafter it sends off flocculent Branches, the greater part of which are by degrees converted into a Placenta at that part of the Uterus where the Ovum happens to be first attach- ed ; the Branches covering the rest of the Ovum be- coming matted together, form what is termed Spongy Chorion, The Rudiments of the Foetus, however, are not al- ways conveyed to the Uterus after Impregnation, for sometimes a Foetus is found in the Ovarium, at other times in one of the Uterine Tubes ; and some rare in- stances have occurred, where the Embryo has dropped from one of the Ovaria or Tubes into the Cavity of the Abdomen, and where a Placenta has been formed, by which it has been nourished. In these cases, which are called Extra-uterine Conceptions^ the Uterus is also found to be somewhat enlarged during the time of Pregnancy. The Ovum, at the early period of Gestation, consists of a thin Membranous Capsule, which incloses the Em- bryo or Germ with the Umbilical Cord and Waters; and the Capsule, again, consists of an Internal Mem- brane called Amnios, on the outside of which is another, termed True Chorion, which is thicker and stronger than the former, and thicker in the early than in the late periods of Pregnancy. This is covered with a Fi-

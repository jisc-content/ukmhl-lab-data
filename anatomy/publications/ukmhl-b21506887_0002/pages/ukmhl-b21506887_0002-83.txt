. Fart IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 55 guish it from the Sclerotica, which these Authors call- ed Cornea Opaca. It forms the anterior Pellucid Covering of the Eye, is more convex than the rest of the Ball, but is not quite circular. It is joined to the Tunica Sclerotica, like the Segment of a small Sphere to that of a larger one. The convexity, however, varies in different per- sons, so as to form a short or long sighted Eye, accord- ing as the Cornea is more or less prominent. It is found also to become more convex when we look at near objects, and the reverse when we view those at a distance. In the former case, the convexity of the Fore ^part of the Eye may be so much increased, by making the Eye-lids approach each other, as to answer the purpose of a convex Glass. In a recent Subject, it is hard, dense, and transpa- rent, but after maceration in water, it becomes soft and opake, and may be readily separated, especially in young Animals, into different Lamellae, the anterior of which is the continuation of the Tunica Adnata. By a slight degree of putrefaction, it may also be separated from the Tunica Sclerotica. In a Whale, the edge of the Cornea is received into a distinct Groove, formed by the Sclerotica. Something of the same kind takes place in the Hu- man Body; but, in the latter, the Sclerotic overlaps more of the anterior than the posterior edge of the Cornea. In a sound state, the Cornea has no Vessels which carry red Blood, though they are frequently seen on it when the Eye is inflamed.

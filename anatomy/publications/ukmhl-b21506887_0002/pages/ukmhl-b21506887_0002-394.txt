318 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. sels run parallel to each other, nor do they receive their twisted appearance till a few weeks afterwards. About the end of the third Month, the Ovum is of the size of a Goose's Egg, and v/eighs about eight ounces, while the Embryo is between two and three ounces in weight, and three inches in length ; and the Head and Extremities being now distinctly observable, it obtains the name of Foetus, which it retains from this time till the end of Gestation. Towards the end of the fourth Month, the motions of the Child begin to be felt by the Mother, inconsequence of which the term Quichening has been applied. In the sixth Month, the Placenta and Membranes weigh seven or eight ounces, the Foetus twelve or thir< teen. It is then eight or nine inches in length, and perfect in all its external parts. In the seventh Month, the Foetus is about a foot in length. At birth the Secundines weigh between a pound and a pound and a half. The Foetus is then about seven pounds, and is from eighteen to twenty inches in length. Still, however, from the difficulty of ascertaining when Pregnancy commences,—from the difference of size of Foetuses of the same age in different Women, and in the same Woman in different Pregnancies,—and from the Foetus being frequently retained in the Uterus some time after it is dead, as well as from the inaccuracy of many of the Figures representing these parts,—the above observations are not altogether to be depended on.

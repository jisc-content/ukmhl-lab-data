Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 263 The Tunica Adiposa covers not only the Kidney, but the large Vessels, and defends them from the pres- sure of the surrounding Viscera. Under the Tunica Adiposa, there is a Membrane, composed of the original proper Coat and Cellular Texture incorporated, which adheres closely to the Kidney, and is reflected over the edges of the Sinus, to be joined to the Pelvis and large Vessels. The surface of the Kidney is commonly smooth and uniform, though sometimes it is irregular, in conse- quence of the Lobes which originally formed it not be- ing completely incorporated. It consists of an outer part called Cortical, and an inner termed Medullary. The Cortical Substance, termed also Secerning, sur- rounds the Kidney, and is about a fourth or third part of an inch in thickness.—It likewise sends in partitions which separate the Medullary parts from each other. The Medidlary, termed also Tubular or Uriniferous Substance, is more compact and of a paler colour than i the former, andns divided into a number of distinct Columns, each of which terminates in a Projection called Papilla, vel Processus Mammillaris. The Papillce are merely the continuation of the Uri- niferous part, though frequently considered as a third division of the Substance of the Kidney. Each Kidney has one, and sometimes more Arteries, of great proportional size, which run transversely from the Aorta, and a Vein still larger than the Artery, which terminates in the Cava.—They enter at the Sinus of the Kidney, and are included in Cellular Substance, which accompanies them throughout their course. The Right Renal Artery is longer than the Left, in

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 327 The Cord, by means of the Vein, conveys pure Blood, of a Vermilion colour, from the Placenta, for the nou- rishment of the Foetus, and, through the medium of the Arteries, returns what is not used in Nutrition, and which is here of a purple colour, again to be mixed with the Blood of the Uterus.—By the intervention of the Cord, also, the Placenta is more readily extracted. The Placenta^ or Cake, or After-hirth, is a Spongy Mass, of a round form, though sometimes oval, or ob- long, occupying nearly a fourth part of the Ovum, and is common to the young of many other Animals. % It is about seven or eight inches in breadth, and up- wards of one inch in thickness, though nearly the double of that when minutely injected ; but is thinner at the edges where the Membranes go off. While attached to the Uterus, it is concave next the Child, and con- vex towards the Womb. The external Surface, or that next the Uterus, is di- vided into Lobules with Fissures between them, while the Internal, or that next the Foetus, forms a regular Mass, which has numerous large Branches of the Um- bilical Vessels spreading out upon it in a radiated man- ner, and afterwards plunging into its Substance. After a good injection of the Blood-vessels of the Placenta, we observe,—on the side next the Child,—the Ramifi- cations of the Umbilical Vessels, forming the principal part of its Substance;—on the side next the Mother, —Branches of the Uterine Arteries, almost of the size of Crow-quills, passing in a convoluted manner between the Uterus and Placenta, and terminating in the latter; —Veins corresponding with these Arteries, but flat and of great size, running obliquely from the Placenta to the

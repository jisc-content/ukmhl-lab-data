COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pari: IV. Glands, and the Substance of the Lungs in general, and are found to communicate with Branches of the Pulmonary Artery. The Bronchial Arteries are supposed to serve for the nourishment of the Lungs, and for the secretion of the Mucus. The Veins return the Blood to the Vena Azygos, and Left Superior Intercostal Vein. The Lymphatics form a Plexus upon the Surface of the Lungs :â€”They communicate freely with the deepr geated Abs^orbents, and pass through the Bronchial plands. The Nerves of the Lungs are partly from the Great Sympathetics, but chiefly from the Eighth Pair, and are rather small in proportion to the Bulk of the Or- gan on which they are dispersed. The Lungs serve the general purpose of Respirationy )vhich consists of Inspiration and Expiration^ or the passage of the Air into, and out from the Lungs, by the alternate dilatation and contraction of the Thorax. During Inspiration, the Thorax is lengthened by the descent of the lateral portions of the Greater Muscle of the Diaphragm ; it is rendered wider by the eleva- tion and expansion of the Bibs ; and, by the ascent of these, is made deeper, the Sternum being at the same time thrust forward. Moderate Itispiration is performed in consequence of the Thorax being dilated by the action chiefly of the Diaphragm, assisted in a small degree by the Intercos- tales ; the Lungs, which are passive, and in contact with the Thorax, following it, and the Air rushing into the Trachea by its own gravity.

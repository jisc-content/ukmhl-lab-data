97 Part IV.J OF THE VISCERA, &c. approach each other at their opposite edges, where they are perforated by numerous Holes. The termination of the Lamina Spiralis, and of the Scala Tympani, forms a HamuluSi^ or small Hook^ which projects into the Infundibulum. One of the Canals or Scalas of the Cochlea opens into the under and fore part of the Vestibule, and is termed Scala Vestibuli; this is not shut by any Membrane: The other, which is the smaller of the twoj communi- cates with the Tympanum by the Fenestra Rotunda^ but is shut in the Subject by the Menibrana Tympani Secundaria, and is called Scala Tympani. The partition between the two Gyri or Turns of the Cochlea, li-ke the Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis, is formed of Uvo Plates, with a small Cavity between them. The Volute, or Spiral of the Cochlea^ begins below, runs forwards, then upwards and rounds so as to form^ as has been already mentioned^ two Circles or Turns and a half, the direction of the Gyri corresponding with those of the Shell of a Snail. The Canals of the Cochlea are Conical, becoming gradually smaller towards the Apex, where they com^ municate with each other, through the medium of the Infundibulum. This communication is called by Cas- SEBOHM, Canalis Scalarum Communis. The Semicircular Canals are three in number,—the Superior or Vertical,—the Posterior or Oblique,—^Sindi the Exterior or Horizontal: The Superior is placed transversely, in the upper part of the Pars Petrosa, with its convex side upwards. The Posterior is farther back than the former one, VOL. II. G

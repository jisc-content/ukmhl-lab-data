388 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Abdomen is proportionally larger and more prominent on account of the bulk and nature of its contents, and the Diaphragm is straighter or less con^ vex towards the Thorax. The Stomach is of a flounder form than in an Adult, and commonly contains a small quantity of Gelatmous Matter. The Omentum has a much smaller quantity of Fat between the Layers of which it is composed, than is found in an Adult. The Valvulse Conniventes on the inner side of the Small Intestines are only beginning to appear. The Appendix Vermiformis is larger in proportion, and is inserted into the extremity of the Colon, which at this time does not project to form a proper Caecum. The Longitudinal Muscular Bands of the great In- testines are less distinct in a Foetus. The Colon, and frequently also the end of the Ilium, are filled with a greenish-hlack Fceces^ of a viscid consistence, termed Meconium^ which is considered to be a mixture of the Bile with Secretions from the Intestines. The Liver is so large as to occupy both Hypochon- driac Regions, and to extend some way beyond the Margin of the Thorax. The Right and left Lobes are more nearly of an equal size than in an Adult. The Gall Bladder is filled with a fluid of a dark green colour and bitter taste. The Umbilical Vein passes from the Umbilicus, in a Duplicature of the Peritoneum, behind the Recti Mus- cles, to the Fossa Umbilicalis of the Liver, and thence to the Left Branch of the Vena Portae, and carries the Blood from the Placenta to the Liver.

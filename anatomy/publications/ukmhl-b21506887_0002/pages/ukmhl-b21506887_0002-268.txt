S18 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paut IV. qualities.â€”This was formerly supposed to come from Glands seated in the Third Coat, but is now more fre- quently considered as a Secretion from the Arteries of the Stomach, no Glands being evident there, at least in the sound state of this Viscus, unless we consider the Villi as such; though in some Animals, as an Ostrich, there are numerous Glands which pour Mucus into the Stomach. The Arteries of the Stomach are derived from the Cceliac Artery. They consist of the Superior Gastric, which supplies the place next the small Curvature; of the Right Inferior Gastric, which goes to the large Curvature, and is a Branch of the Hepatic; of the Py- loric Arteries, which are small Branches from the Gas- trics and the Hepatics; and of the Left Gastric and Ar- terige Breves, which are Branches of the Splenic Artery. When the Arteries arrive at the Curvatures of the Stomach, they separate into two Layers, or Sets of Branches; the inner is spread out upon the Nervous Coat, and is distributed to the Villi by Filaments, which form a most delicate Plexus. The External Layer is expanded under the Peritoneal Coat, supplying it and the Muscular one with numerous Branches, which form frequent Anastomoses with each other. The Veins have the same names, and nearly the same course, with the Arteries. The whole of them termi- nate in the Vena Portse. The Absorbents of the Stomach are numerous and large. They pass through small Glands situated upon its Curvatures, and go afterwards to the Thoracic Duct. They appear to carry Lymph only, no Chyle having been detected in them, even in cases where the Lacteals

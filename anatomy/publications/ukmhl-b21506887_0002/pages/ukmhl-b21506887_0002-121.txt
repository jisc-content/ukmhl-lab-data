Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 87 It is formed partly of a continuation of the lining of the Meatus, but chiefly of the Periosteum. The Membrana Tympani has numerous small Vessels, from the Temporal and Stylo-mastoid Arteries, which run in a radiated manner, and which are most abundant in a Foetus. The course of the Vessels in it may be the cause of its having been lately described as a Mus- cle with radiated Fibres. This Membrane serves, by its form and tension, to collect the vibrations of sound, and to conduct them from the outer to the inner Ear. In a Foetus, the Membrana Tympani is fixed in an imperfect ring of Bone, being open above, and, along with the Meatus, it is covered with a Mucous Substance, which defends the parts from the too strong impulse of Sound. The Mucous Membrane sloughs off by de- grees after birth. Internal Ear The Internal Ear comprehends the Tt/mpanum, La byrinth, and certain Passages leading into these. The Tympanum is situated at the inner side of the Membrana Tympani, approaches to a hemispherical figure, and is about half an inch in width. Between the Tympanum and Cavity called Laby- rinth, there is an Osseous Septum, which forms the bot tom of the Tympanum, where there are several Emi- nences, viz. The Prom ontory, which forms the beginning of the

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 315 the Urethra, or the Membrane is of a Semilunar form, the broad part being turned towards the Perineum. When the Hymen is ruptured, which is commonly in the first Sexual intercourse, it degenerates into small Conical Papillae, termed CarunculcB Myrtiformes^ from their supposed resemblance to Myrtle-berries. The Hymen has been considered as a test of Virgi- nity ;â€”^but neither the presence nor the absence of this Membrane can be depended on as a certain criterion. Sometimes the Hymen is impervious, in which case the Menstrual Fluid is retained in the Vagina, till an incision is made to allow it to be discharged. About the Orifice of the Vagina are several Mucous Follicles, similar to those round the Opening of the Urethra. The Blood-vessels and Nerves of the External Parts are from the Pudic Branches, and are dispersed in nu- merous Ramifications upon the end of the Vagina, La- bia Externa, and Clitoris. The Absorbents pass partly to the Inguinal Glands, and partly to those placed at the sides of the Pelvis, or upon the Lumbar Vertebrae.

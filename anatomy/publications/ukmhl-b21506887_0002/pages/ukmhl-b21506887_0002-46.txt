34 COxMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Like the greater part of the Ventricles, they are co- vered externally with a Medullary Lamina;â€”internally they are found to consist of Medullary and Cineritious Laminae, which have a convoluted appearance. At the inner edge of the Pedes Hippocampi, there is a plated^ serrated, or indented Margin, which, in the generality of Quadrupeds, is much larger, in proportion to the size of the Brain, than it is in Man. The resemblance, however, to the Human kind, in the structure of this particular part of the Brain, is more striking in the Ape than in any other Quadruped. In the bottom of the Lateral Ventricles, behind the anterior Crura of the Fornix, and before the meeting of the Choroid Plexuses of these Ventricles, below the an- terior part of the Body of the Fornix, and over the fore part of the third Ventricle, there is a Hole of an oval form, by which the Lateral Ventricles communicate freely with each other. See Monro's Ohs. an Nerv, Syst. 1783, and Treatise on the Brain, 1797. After dividing and turning back the Fornix, another communication from the above passage is found, called Foramen Commune Anterius, Vulva, or Iter ad Infun- dibulum; but properly, Iter ad Tertium Ventriculum, being a Passage to the Third Ventricle. ' Between the Commissura Mollis of the Optic Tha- lami and Substance called Pineal Gland, there is a small passage termed Anus, or Foramen Commune Posterius, which has been supposed by some Authors to form a communication between the back part of the 1 bird Ventricle and Lateral Ventricles; but it is completely closed up by the Tela Choroidea,

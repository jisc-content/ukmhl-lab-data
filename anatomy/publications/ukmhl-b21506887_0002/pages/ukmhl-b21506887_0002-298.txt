248 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Lymphatics of the Liver are so numerous as to cover almost the whole of its outer Surface. See Lym- phatics of Liver in Vol. III. They discharge their contents partly into the beginning of the Thoracic Duct, and partly into a Plexus situated behind the Sternum. The Nerves of the Liver are also numerous. They arise from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair, and accompany the Blood-vessels. The Biliary Ducts arise by extremely minute Branches, termed Pori Bildrii, vel Tuhuli Bili/eri, chiefly from the extremities of the Vena Portse, in the Substance of the Corpuscles, through the whole of the Liver. The Pori Bilarii run in company with the Branches of the Artery and Veins, and unite into larger and larger Branches, which afterwards join into two, and these again into a single Trunk, called Ductus Hepa- ticus, in the Sinus Portarum. The Ductus Hepaticus serves to carry the Gall or Bile from the Liver,â€”and to convey it, by the power of the Heart, Hepatic Artery, and Vena Portae, assist- ed by the pressure of the surrounding Muscles, to the Duodenum, and partly to the Vesicula Fellis. - Gall-Bladder. The Vesicula vel Cystis Fellis, or Gall-Bladder, is a small oval or Pyriform Bag, but varying in figure and size in different individuals, and consists of a Fundus, Body, and Cervix, situated upon the concave side of the Great Lobe of the Liver, and placed in a trans- verse direction from behind forwards.

U2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. towards the middle of the lower side of the Great Lobe, and representing a kind of Tail. The Lohulus Anonymus^ vel Quadratus, which is placed between the passage of the Round Ligament and the Gall-bladder, and is less prominent, but broader than the former Lobule. From the Lobulus Anonymus, a Bridge, called Pons vel Isthmus Hepatis, runs across the passage for the Substance termed Round Ligament, to be joined to the Left Lobe:—The Pons Hepatis is sometimes wanting. Upon the under side of the Liver, there are several Depressions and Fissures, which are occupied by the contiguous Viscera, of which the following are the principal:— The Great Fissure, called Fossa UmbilicaMs, be- tween the Right and Left Lobes, at the under and fore part of the Liver, for the passage of the Umbilical Vein in the Foetus, or the Round Ligament of the Liver in the Adult. The Fossa Umbilicalis is terminated by a Notch at the fore part of the Liver,—of different depths in diffe- rent Bodies;—and behind, it is commonly covered with the Pons Hepatis. The Principal Fissure, termed Sulcus Transversus, vel Sinus Portarum, extending from right to left, be- tween the Great and Small Lobes, and bounded by these Lobes at its extremities ; by the Lobulus Anony- mus before, and the Lobulus Spigelii behind; the two latter forming parts compared by the Ancients to a Gate, and therefore called Porta. The Porta receives the Great Blood-vessels and the

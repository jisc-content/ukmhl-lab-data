rAKT IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 267 between the Right and Left Kidney^ when separated from the Body. The Ureters descend in the Loins obliquely inwards behind the Peritoneum, and go over the Psoae and Iliac Vessels, opposite to the anterior and lateral part of the Os Sacrum. They pass afterwards into the Pelvis, and terminate ob- liquely in the under, outer, and back part of the Bladder. In their descent, they do not run in a straight, but in a waving direction, somewhat similar to the Italicyjâ€” neither are they cylindrical, as they form slight dilata. tions and contractions in their course, two of which con- tractions are more observable in their passage over the Psoae Muscles, and at their insertion into the Bladder. The Ureters are covered anteriorly by the Perito- neum, and composed of an External Membranous Coat, a Middle Muscular one, formed chiefly of Circular Fi- bres, and an Internal Coat, sometimes called Villous, but which is a real Mucous Membrane- The Inner Coat is very Vascular, and is perforated by the Mouths of small Ducts, which line it with a Mucus to defend it from the Urine. The Vessels and Nerves of the Ureters are from those of the contiguous parts. The Kidneys secrete the Urine from the Blood, and convey it by means of Ureters to the Bladder. RENAL GLANDS. The Renal Glands, termed also Capsulce Atrahilarioe, Capsulcv Renales, Renes Succenturiati, and Glandulce Supra-Renales, are two small, flat, Glandular-like Bo-

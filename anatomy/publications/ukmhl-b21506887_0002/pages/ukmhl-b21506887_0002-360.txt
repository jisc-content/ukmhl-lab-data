The Vas Deferens is remarkable for the thickness and firmness of its Coats, and proportional smallness of its Cavity. Like most other Secretory Ducts, it is desti- tute of any visible Muscular Fibres, though it has been supposed by some Authors, that such a contractile power resides in the Seminal Ducts, as to assist the Vis a Tergo in propelling the Semen from the Testicle.

The Vesiculce Seminales are two small, white, Pyri- form Receptacles, situated between the under and late- ral parts of the Bladder and the Intestinum Rectum. â€”Each is about three inches in length, and nearly one in breadth, and a little flattened. They are at a considerable distance from each other behind, but anteriorly they converge, and become con- tiguous to each other. Each of them is shut at its posterior extremity, and is composed of a convoluted Tube, to the sides of which are attached a number of Processes, irregular in their form. They are surrounded by a quantity of tough Cellular Substance, and by many Vessels and Nerves, but they have no Muscularity. Their Substance is somewhat similar to that of the Vasa Deferentia, but they are more tender.

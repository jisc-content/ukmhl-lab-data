IPart IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 301 Cul de Sacs ; one between the Bladder and Uterus, the other between the Uterus and Rectum. The Uterus and Ligamenta Lata separate the Pelvis into anterior and posterior Cavities or Chambers, and the Ligamenta Lata are subdivided into large and small, or anterior and posterior Alae or Pinions. The Ligamenta Lata contain and support the Ovaria and Uterine Tubes, with part of the Ligamenta Rotun- da, Spermatic, and Uterine Vessels and Nerves, &c.; connect the Uterus to the sides of the Pelvis, and assist in retaining it in its place. In the time of Gestation, they become effaced by furnishing the distended Uterus with part of its external covering. The Ligamenta Rotunda are two long and slender Cords, composed chiefly of Blood-vessels and Ligamen- tous Fibres. They arise immediately before and below the Fallopian Tubes, from the corners of the Uterus, from which they descend obliquely in the Ligamenta Lata, diminishing a little in their course towards the Groins. They pass through the Rings of the Abdominal Muscles, in the same manner as the Spermatic Cords do in the Male, and are afterwards inserted by sepa- rate Branches into the upper and lateral parts of the Pudendum, where they are insensibly lost. They assist the Ligamenta Lata in preserving the equilibrium of the Uterus. The Ovaria, anciently called Testes Muliehres, are situated at the sides of the Fundus Uteri, about an inch distant from it, and are contained in the posterior Pi- nions of the Ligamenta Lata, which form a Coat to them, similar to the Tunica Albuginea Testis.

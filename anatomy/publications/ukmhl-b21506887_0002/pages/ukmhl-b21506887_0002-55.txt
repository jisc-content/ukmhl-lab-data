Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 43 and contiguous to each other, and, from their shape, have the name of Corpora Pyramidalia, \el Eminentice Pyramidales. Between the Corpora Pyramidalia, the Anterior Me- dian Fissure is-deep, where the Pia Mater penetrates, and where the Blood-vessels pass into the anterior part of the Medulla. At the outside of the former Eminences, are two others, somewhat of the figure of Olives, from which they are termed Corpom Olivaria, vel Eminentice Oli- vares. Within the Corpus Olivare, on each side, there is a thin Capsule of Cineritious Substance running from above downwards, inclosing Medullary Matter, and named by Vic D^Azyr, the Corpus Dentatum vel Rhomhoideum of this Substance. More externally than the Corpora Olivaria, and oc- cupying the whole remaining part of the Cord round to the posterior Median Fissure, are other two Emi- nences, less evident than the last, which have been de- scribed by some Authors under the names of Corpora Pyramidalia Posteriora^ Corpora Restiformia, Pedun- cles of the Medidla Ohlongata^ &c. The two lateral Portions of the Medulla Oblongata are formed of Medullary Matter without, and a large proportion of Cineritious Matter within, joined to- gether by Medullary Fibres. When the Corpora Pyramidalia of the Medulla are separated some way from each other, after being steep- ed in a coagulating liquor, there is an appearance of a decussation of Fibres from the opposite sides. These apparent Fibres Drs Gall and Spurziieim arrange

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 93 Action : To pull the Malleus and Membrana Tym- pani inwards, by which the Membrane is rendered more tense, and more concave towards the Meatus Externus, and thereby better adapted for the impression of weak Sounds. Laxator Tympani, vel Exfemm Mallei. Origin : By a very small beginning, from the extre- mity of the Spinous Process of the Sphenoid Bone, be- hind the entry of the Artery of the Dura Mater; after which it runs backwards and a little upwards, along with a Branch of the Seventh Pair of Nerves, called Chorda Tympani^ at the outside of the Eustachian Tube, in a Fissure of the Os Temporis, near the Fossa which lodges the Condyle of the Lower Jaw. Insertion: Into the long Process of the Malleus, which is lodged in a small Canal at the upper part of the Tympanum. Action: To draw the Malleus obliquely forwards and outwards, and thereby to render the Membrana Tympani less convex, or to relax it when sounds are too strong. This Muscle is so small and tender, that its nature is known with difficulty. Haller denies the existence of Muscular Fibres in it.â€”Sabatier describes it, but doubts its Muscularity. The Laxator Tympani of Albinus, a minute Sub- stance, arising from that part of the Meatus Auditorius to which the upper edge of the Membrana Tympani is fixed, 3hd inserted into the Superior Extremity of the Handle of the Malleus, is considered by many Ana- tomists as a Ligament.

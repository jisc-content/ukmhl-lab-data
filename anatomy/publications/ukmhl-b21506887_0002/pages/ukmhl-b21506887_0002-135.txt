Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 101 Tbe Arteries of the Labyrinth arise by one or two small branches, chiefly from the Vertebral Artery, and pass through the Cribriform Plate, at the bottom of the Meatus Internus which belongs to the Labyrinth. From the Labyrinth one or two Veins yeturn, and terminate in the end of the Lateral Sinus, The Cavity of the Vestibule is constantly filled with a Watery Fluid called Aqit'CL Lahyrinthi, supposed to be secreted from the Arteries of the Periosteum, and which is found to resemble the Aqueous Humour of the Eye. The Aqueous Fluid fills the Vestibule and Scalae of the Cochlea, and likewise surrounds the Membranous Semicircular Canals, The Aqua Lahyrinthi is considered as a medium by which sounds are communicated from the Membrane filling the round and oval Holes, and from the Base of the Stapes to the Pulpy Membrane placed in the La- byrinth. The superfluous part of the Aqua Labyrinthi is sup- posed by CoTUNNius to be carried off* by two small Conical Ducts, more particularly described by him than by some preceding Anatomists, who were partly acquainted with them, but considered them as Blood- vessels. One of the Aqueducts of Cotunnius, called Aquoe- ductus Cochlece, begins at the under part of the Scala Tympani, near the Fenestra Rotunda, and, after pass- ing through the Pars Petrosa, is seen, in the figures he gives of it, terminating by a wide triangular Opening, upon the Surface of the Dura Mater, between the pas- sages of the Seventh and Eighth Pair of Nerves. The other Duct, called Aqticeductus VestibuU, begins

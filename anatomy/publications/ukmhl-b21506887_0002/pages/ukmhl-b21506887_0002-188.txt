146 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. OF THE THROAT, &c. The Throat consists of the Arches of the Palate^ of the Pharynx and Larynx, with the Muscles, Vessels, Nerves, &c. which surround them; to these may be added the Thyroid Gland. The Arches of the Palate are two in number in each side of the Throat, one of which is termed the Ante- rior, the other the Posterior Arch. They are formed of a Doubling of the Skin, with a few scattered Muscular Fibres. The Anterior Arch arises from the nliddle of the Ve- lum Palati, at the side of the Uvula, and is fixed to the edge of the Base of the Tongue. The Posterior Arch has its origin likewise from the side of the Uvula, and passes downwards, to be insert- ed into the side of the Pharynx. The Anterior Arch contains the Circumflexus Pala- ti, and, with its fellow on the opposite side, forms the opening into the Throat, called Isthmus Faucium. The Posterior Arch has within it the Levator Palati. Between the Anterior and Posterior Arches, and close by the sides of the Base of the Tongue, the Amygdalce, Tonsils, or Almonds of the Ears, are situated. They are of a reddish colour, of an oval form, or somewhat of the figure of Almonds, full of Cells, which communicate with each other, and have large irregular Openings, which convey Mucus into the Throat; the discharge of which is promoted by the motion of the Arches of the Palate and surrounding parts.

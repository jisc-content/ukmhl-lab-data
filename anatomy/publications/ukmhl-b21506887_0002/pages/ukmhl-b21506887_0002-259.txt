Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 209 The middle of this Region is termed Epigastrium, or upper part of the Belly, and the two lateral parts Hypochondria^ from their lying under the Cartilages of the False Ribs. The Middle Region occupies an equal distance above and below the Umbilicus.—The middle part of it is called the Umbilical, and its lateral parts the Lumbar Regions or Loins. The Under Region begins where the middle one ter- minates, or at a line drawn between the superior-ante- rior Spinous Processes of the Ossa Ilii, and forms, in the middle, the Hypogastrium, or bottom of the Belly; and at the sides, the Iliac Regions. The Abdomen is covered on the outside by the com- mon Integuments, and lined within by the Peritoneum, in the manner the Thorax is lined by the Pleura, but without being divided by the intervention of a Parti- tion. The Abdomen contains the Chylopoietic and Assis- tant Chylopoietic Viscera, or Organs of Digestion,—the Organs of Urine, SiVLd. part of those of Generation, with the Vessels and Nerves which belong, some of them to these Viscera, and others to the lower parts of the Body. The Chylopoietic Viscera comprehend the Stomach, which is situated in the upper and left pa^-t of the Ab- domen,—the Intestines, which fill the greater part of it,—and the Membranes, termed Omenta and Mesen- tery, which are connected with these. The Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera consist of the Liver, which is placed in the upper and right side of VOL. II. O

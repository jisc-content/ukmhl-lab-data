106 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. And by the Ossa Maxillaria Super tor a ^ Ossa Palati, Os Sphenoides, Ossa Spo7igiosa Inferiora^ and Vomer^ which form the under^ inner, and back parts. The Two Cavities, or Nostrils, terminate anteriorly in the Face, and posteriorly in the Fauces, and are much enlarged by the different Sinuses which commu- nicate with them. The under and fore part of the Nose consists of Five Cartilages, of a somewhat regular figure, and of some smaller pieces, which are more irregular, and of an in- determinate number. Of the five Cartilages, one is situated in the ,middle, and the other four laterally. The middle Cartilage is the most considerable, and supports the rest: It constitutes the Cartilaginous part of the Septum Narium, and is joined to the anterior edge of the Nasal Lamella of the Ethmoid Bone, to the anterior edge of the Vomer, and to the fore part of the Spinous Process of the Superior Maxillary Bones. Of the lateral Cartilages, two are placed anteriorly, forming by their curved union the tip of the Nose; and two posteriorly, which form the Alse Nasi. Between the anterior and posterior Cartilages, ^re Spaces filled with additional Cartilages, the number, size> a^nd figure, varying in different Bodies. The Elasticity of the Cartilages contributes to the defence of the Nose against external injuries. The Nose is covered by the Common Integuments, which are perforated, especially at the under and outer parts of this Organ, by the Ducts of Sebaceous Glands, the contents of which may be readily squee^zfed 6\xt by the pressure of the Fingers.

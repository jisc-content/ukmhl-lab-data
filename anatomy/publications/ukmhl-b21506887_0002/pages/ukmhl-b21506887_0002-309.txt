Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 259 is remarkably thin in its Coats, of a white colour, and semi-transparent. It begins at the Left Extremity of the Pancreas, runs somewhat Serpentine in the Substance of the Gland, a little below its middle height, becoming gradually lar- ger in consequence of receiving the diiferent Branches which compose it,—and is at last somewhat larger than a Raven's Quill. At the Right Extremity of the Pancreas, it receives the principal Duct of the Pancreas Minus, and termi- nates obliquely in the Duodenum by an Orifice com- mon to it and the Ductus Communis Choledochus.— In some rare cases, however, it terminates at a little distance from the Biliary Duct; and sometimes also the Duct of the Pancreas Minus ends separately in the Duodenum. The Pancreas secretes a Liquid^ (to the nature of which no great attention has been paid), but it resem- bles the Saliva in quality and appearance, and dis- charges it by its excretory Duct into the Duodenum. The Pancreatic Juice incorporates the Bile with the Alimentary Mass, blunts the Acrimony of these, or of Acids which may be formed in the Canal, and may be said also to answer some of the purposes to the Con- tents of the Intestines, which the Gastric Juice does to those of the Stomach ; or, it finishes that Digestive Process in the Intestines, which was begun in the Sto- mach.

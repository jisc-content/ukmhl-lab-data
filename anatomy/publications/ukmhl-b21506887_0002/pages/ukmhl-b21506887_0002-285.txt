Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 9.S5 and in having fewer and smaller Lacteal Vessels.—In this Intestine the Valvulse Conniventes gradually de^ crease in size and number, and at length entirely dis- appear.—At its under end, the Mucous Glands are dis- tinct and frequent. The Small Intestines in general admit the food to be divided into the Nutritive part or Chyme, and the Ex- crementitious part or Faeces. They promote the for- mation of the Chyle,—allow it to be separated from the Chyme, and to be absorbed,—and propel the re- mains of the Food into the Large Intestines. Structure of the Great Intestines in general. The Great have the same number of Coats with the Small Intestines, but differ from them in being thick- er and stronger.—The Valvulae Conniventes are deep, and placed opposite to each other, and, like the Small Intestines, diminish in number and size towards the under extremity.—The Villous appearance is much less distinct.—The Mucous Glands are larger, but simpler than those of the Small Intestines. Structure of the Great Intestines in particular. The Intestinum Ccecum is of the same general struc- ture with the rest of the Great Intestines : Its Villi are very short; and it has a number of solitary Mucous Glands, broader than those of the Small Intestines, which, when diseased, sometimes appear like Small- pox, with a Perforation in each. The Appendix Vermiformis is of the same structure

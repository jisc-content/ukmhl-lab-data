SO^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Ovaria are plain ai)ove, and prominent and semi-oval below, flattened at their anterior and poste- rior Surface; and the size of each, when in a state of the greatest maturity^ is nearly equal to that of half of the Male Testicle. â–  ^ ' In the vigour of life they are large, uniform, and smooth, but become small, unequal, and shrivelled, in old Women, and in those who have born many Chil- dren. This unequal appearance, however, is greatly owing to the habit of Body, as it frequently occurs in a young Adult Virgin. They are attached to the Uterus by the Ligamenta Lata, and by two small Cords termed Ligamenta Ro- tunda Ovarii^ which were mistaken by the Ancients for Vasa Deferentia, carrying a secreted Liquor to the Uterus. They are composed internally of a loose whitish Cel- lular and Spongy Substance, intermixed with Vessels and Nerves, and contain a number of small Vesicles called Ova, filled with a limpid Fluid, which partakes of the qualities of the white of an Egg. These Vesicles differ in the same Ovarium, from the size of a Mustard-seed to that of a small Garden-Pea, and the largest are commonly placed nearest the Sur- face. The number of Ova is differently estimated by dif- ferent Anatomists: from ten to about twenty having been found in one Ovarium. According to experiments made by Mr John Hun- ter, it is ascertained, that the number of Ova exist- ing originally in each Ovarium, whether that number

1^6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, enables them to resist the impression of hard Sub- stances placed between them during manducation; nor are they, from this structure, so apt to exfoliate by disease, nor so easily fractured by the inordinate mo- tion of the Jaws. Near the point of each of the Roots of the Teeth, there is a Foramen^ and a passage leading from it into a common Cavity in the Body of the Tooth, for lodg- ing the Substance called Fulp of the Tooth. The Foramen is placed towards one side of the point, which prevents the Vessels and Nerves entering here from being injured by pressure. In old people, the Foramen is sometimes obliterated; in such cases the Vessels and Nerves are destroyed. The shape of the Cavity resembles that of the Body of the Tooth, being narrow next the Fangs, and gra- dually expanding towards the opposite extremity. The Cavity is smooth, and has no Cancelli nor Mar- row, being filled with the Pulp, which is inclosed in a fine Membrane, connected to the Tooth by Cellular Substance. The Pulp consists of minute Vessels and Nerves, in- termixed with Gelatinous Matter, the remains of that which gave origin to the Tooth; and which, being ex- posed, occasions Tooth-ache. The Arteries of the Teeth called Dental, are Branches of the Internal Maxillary; the Veins returning from them pass into the Internal Jugular Veins. After the Arteries have entered the Teeth, they are dispersed upon the Membrane which lines their Cavity, as may be seen by injecting them.â€”The Vascularity of the Teeth is also proved by the appearance produced

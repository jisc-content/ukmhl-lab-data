166 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Cavities, and contains several Vessels, Nerves, &c. be- tween its Layers;—the Pericardium and Hearty which occupy the middle;—^and the Lungs, which surround the Heart, and fill the greater part of the Thorax. Pleura. The Pleura is a thin Membrane, with some degree of transparency, and of considerable strength, which lines the inner side of the Thorax, and covers most of its contents. Its External Surface is Cellular, and adheres closely to the parts with which it is connected. Its Internal Surface is smooth and polished, being moistened by a Serous Fluid, which exudes from its Arteries; hence the Pleura is one of those Membranes called Serous. It is divided into two lateral Sacs, or Pleurce, of un- equal size, the right being the larger, corresponding with the greater size of the Right Lung, which it covers. The form of the Sacs correspond exactly with that of the surrounding Bones of the Thorax. The Pleurae adhere to the Periosteum of the Ribs, line the Inter-costales and Sterno-costales, the Ster- num, and Dorsal Vertebrae, and cover the Pericardium, Lungs, and lateral or fleshy parts of the Diaphragm. They descend at the under part of the Thorax, as far as the Twelfth Pair of Ribs, to which they are at- tached ; and, at the upper end, they rise a little above the first Rib on each side. Behind the Sternum, the Pleurae are contiguous to

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 5 are sent into the Skin, which line the passages by which the Cutis is perforated. Many opinions have been advanced concerning the Origin of the Cuticle. The latest and most probable is, that it is formed by a condensation of the Corpus Mucosum, or by the extremities of Excretory Vessels ; —its density, however, is such, that no Vessels can be traced in it, either by the Eye, or by the assistance of glasses. It appears also to be destitute of Absorbent Vessels and Nerves. The Cuticle serves to protect the sensible parts under it, and to regulate the proportion of the Fluids thrown out, or taken in, by the Surface of the Skin ;—-parti- cularly, to prevent too great a degree of evaporation. The Cuticle is found to be insoluble in Water, and also in Alcohol, but is readily dissolved in the Alkalis. It is observed to resemble coagulated Albumen. Corpus Mucosum. The Corpus Mucosum has been commonly called Rete Mucosum, from the supposition that it is formed of a Mucous Net-work. It is situated under the Cu- ticle, which it connects to the Cutis Vera. It is composed of the terminations of extremely mi- nute Vessels passing between the Cutis and Cuticle, which are surrounded by a Mucilaginous or Viscid Substance, properly called Corpus Mucosum. It is the chief cause of that variety of colour, which characterizes the natives of different climates, and dif- ferent people of the same climate ; being semi-transpa- rent, and white, or rather of ,a light grey colour in a

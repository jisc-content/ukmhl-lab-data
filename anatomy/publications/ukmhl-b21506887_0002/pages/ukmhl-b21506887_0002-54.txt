43 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. of the Body of the Sphenoid, and Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bones. It is of a roundish form, or it approaches somewhat to that of a Cube with round- ed corners, and measures upwards of an inch, whether taken in a longitudinal or transverse direction. Many Transverse Streaks and Furrows run on its Surface, and it is divided into two lateral parts by a longitudinal Depression, occasioned by the situation of the Vertebral Artery. At the fore and back parts of the Tuber, and at the extremities of the depression made by the Vertebral Artery, are the Foramina Cceca, Anterius et Posterius^ the former placed between the Nerves of the Third, and the latter between those of the Sixth Pair. These two Foramina penetrate only a little way into the edges of the Tuber, and receive a Plexus of Vessels. The Substance of the Tuber is intermixed with a considerable quantity of Cortical Matter, formed into Strioe running in different directions, the Stries ap- pearing more or less distinct, according to the course of incisions which may be made. Continued from the Tuber, there is a large Sub- stance in form of an inverted Cone, which extends to the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone, under the name of Medulla Oblongata, which forms the beginning of the Spinal Marrow. The Medulla Oblongata has a longitudinal Fissure before, and another behind, dividing it into two lateral Portions or Cords, having the name of Anterior and Posterior Median Fissures. Upon the anterior Surface of the Medulla Oblongata two small Eminences appear, which run longitudinally,

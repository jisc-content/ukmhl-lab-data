Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. m Bladder, and has sometimes of late been called Fascia Vesicalis. It is also fixed to the Umbilicus by three Ligaments situated between the Peritoneum and Abdominal Mus- cles.—They are formed of the Urachus running up- wards from the Fundus, and of the shrivelled Umbi- lical Arteries passing obliquely from the sides of the Bladder. The Bladder, as well as the under end of the Rec- tum, is supported below by the Muscles, and by vari- ous Tendinous Fasciae running between these. The firmest connexion is by means of two Ligamen- tous Expansions, which run from each side of the Neck of the Bladder and Prostate Gland, to be fixed to the under and inner part of the Symphysis of the Ossa Pubis.—It is connected also at this place to the Penis, by the Urethra. - It is composed of different Coats joined together by loose Cellular Substance; the first of which is only a partial one continued from the Peritoneum. The Peritoneal or Common Coat, recedes from the Abdominal Muscles at the top of the Pubes, and passes over the superior, and down upon the posterior and lateral parts of the Bladder to its under Extremity, or to near the termination of the Ureters, where it is about a finger's length from the Anus, and is here reflected upon the Rectum, and back and lateral part of the Pelvis, forming at this place a kind of Cul de Sac. When the Bladder is much distended, it carries the Peritoneum with it, and leaves a space between that Membrane and the Pubes, of such length, that an Inci- sion has frequently been made here, and large Calculi

132 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Surfaces are not so distinct, and the Teeth themselves- ha^e a slight inclination inwards in the Jaws. The Molares, or Grinders, formerly termed Large Molares, which are the most numerous but shortest of any, are behind the Bicuspidati. They are the largest of the Teeth, and have broad Bases with several points. The roots divaricate from each other, and have partitions of the Sockets between them, which as- sist in lessening the pressure on their points during Manducation. They have thinner Enamel than the other Teeth. The first of the Molares of the Under Jaw has five, and each of the others has four points. Each has two roots, one placed forwards, the other backwards, and these are flat and broad, their flat Sur- faces facing anteriorly and posteriorly. Sometimes there are three roots. In the Upper J aw, the first Molaris has four, and each of the others only three points. In the two anterior Molares of the Upper Jaw, there are generally three roots, of which two are on the outer side ; the third is on the inner side, and placed oblique- ly, and is the largest and roundest of the three. The roots of the two anterior Molares of the "Upper Jaw are shorter than those of the Under one, on account of their situation under the Maxillary Sinus; in certain cases, they project some way into it. Sometimes, though rarely, there are four roots. The Molares above have a perpendicular direction in respect to the Jaw, those below have an inclination inwards, which should be attended to by Dentists in the extraction of the Teeth.

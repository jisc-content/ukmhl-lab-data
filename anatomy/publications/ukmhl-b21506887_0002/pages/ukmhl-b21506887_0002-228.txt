178 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paut IV. Pillars in it, which, from their supposed resemblance to the Teeth of a Comb, sometimes obtain the name of Musculi Auriculae Pectinati. The Musculi Pectinati have smaller columns run- ning in different directions, giving the whole a reticu- lated appearance. Between the Fleshy Pillars are Depressions^ or Fur- rows, where the sides of the Auricle are thin, and se- mi-transparent, being here chiefly formed of the outer and inner Membranes only. The High t Auricle receives the Blood from the Vena3 Cavss and Coronary Veins, and, by its Muscular con- traction, discharges it into the corresponding Ventricle, out of which it is prevented from returning by the Tricuspid Valve, placed within the Ventricle. At the under and left side of the Sinus Venosus, and opposite to a Groove situated externally between the Auricle and Ventricle, there is a Circular Hole, above an inch and a half in diameter, which opens into the upper and right part of the corresponding Ventricle, and is termed Auricular Orifice of the Ventricle. The Right or Pulmonary Ventricle is situated on the fore side of the Heart, the Base and Apex correspond- ing to those of the Heart; in general this is of a tri- angular form externally, and is about the sixth part of an inch in thickness, and of course stronger than the corresponding Auricle, which has merely to send the Blood to the Ventricle. It has internally, but more especially towards the Apex Cordis, many strong Ei;iinences, Columns, La- certuli, or Cords,/called Columnce Carnece. The Columnce run in different directions, but the

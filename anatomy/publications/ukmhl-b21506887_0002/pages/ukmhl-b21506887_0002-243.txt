Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 19S The Serum is a little heavier than Water, and of a yellowish-green colour. When slightly heated it coagu- lates, owing to the presence of Albumen. From the Coagulum a thin turbid Fluid can be separated, which is called Serosity. This contains Water, with a small proportion of Albumen, and different Saline Substances. Gelatin was also considered as a constituent of the Se- rum, but late experiments show that this opinion is not well founded. The Clot is of a dark red colour, but acquires a more florid hue on exposure to the Air. When put into a Bag, and washed with Water, it is separated into two parts, the red Globules, which the Water retains, and a Substance termed Gluten, Coagulahle Lymph, or Fi~ brin, which is of a white colour, and an elastic Fibrous nature, and which forms the Buffy Coat seen on the surface of the Blood of a Person labouring under In- flammation. Berzelius and Brande have shewn that the Clot is a compound of Fibrin, Albumen, and Co- louring Matter of the Blood. From late experiments, it appears that the colouring Particles contain Iron, with some Saline Matter, the former of which is supposed by some to be the cause of the red colour of the Blood, while others assert that the colouring Matter is an Animal Substance of a pe- culiar nature. LUNGS. The Lungs are two soft spongy Bodies, which occu- py the greater part of the Cavity of the Thorax. They completely fill the two Bags of the Pleura, and are every where in contact with the parts adjacent; VOL. II. N

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 307 with their fellows in the opposite sides of the Uterus, so as to supply the whole Substance of that Viscus. The Vagina is supplied on each side by the Faginal Arteries from the Uterine, and by small Branches from the Umbilical, middle Hasmorrhoidal, and Pudic Ar- teries. The Spermatic Veins^ in passing from the Ovaria and Uterus, form a complicated Plexus. They have the same termination as in the Male, but are consider- ably larger.—The Uterine and the Vaginal Veins run into the Internal Uiacs. The Lymphatics of the Uterus and its Appendages, like the Blood-vessels, run also in two Sets. Those of the one Set accompany the Spermatic Blood-vessels, and, in a similar manner to the Absorbents of the Testes in a Male, go to the Lumbar Glands. Those of the other correspond with the Hypogastric Blood-vessels, and terminate in the Glands at the lateral parts of the Pelvis. The Nerves are from the Lumbar, Sacral, and Great Sympathetics. The Uterus, by means of the Fallopian Tubes, re- ceives from the Ovaria the Rudiments of the Foetus,—- nourishes it, and, after bringing it to maturity, expels it through the Os Internum Uteri and Vagina. From the Arteries of theinner Surface of the Uterus, the Menstrual Evacuation is also discharged. The Menses or Courses commonly make their ap- pearance, in the Females of this Country, about the fourteenth year, but two or three years sooner in hot Climates, and often as much later in colder Regions. The commencement is affected also by the nature of the Constitution, and the manner of living. u 2

110 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. it terminates at the inner and fore part of the Antrum Maxillare, under the Os Spongiosum Inferius, a little behind the anterior extremity of that Bone, and in a direct line upwards from the second Dens Molaris. The upper part of the Groove forms only a semi- canal, the under end a complete one. The Lacrymal Sac is a Membranous Canal, situated in the upper part of the Lacrymal Groove, behind the Tendon of the Orbicularis of the Eye-lids; about a fourth part of it above the Tendon, and forming a kind of Intestinum C^cum, and the rest below it. Towards the inner Angle of the Eye, behind the Tendon of the Orbicularis, the Sac is perforated by the Lacr^^mal Ducts. The continuation of the Sac becoming a little narrow* er, but without possessing any Valve, passes into the Nose, under the name of Canalis JVasalis, Ductus ad Nasum, or Lacrymal Di^ct, and terminates at the infe- rior extremity of the Osseous Canal, by a round Aper- ture, large enough to admit the blunt end of a Sur- geon's Probe. The Structure of the Lacrymal Sac and Duct is si- milar to that of the Membrana Schneideriana. They are defended by the same kind of Mucus with which this Membrane is lubricated, and are firmly connected to the Periosteum of the Osseous Canal. The Use of this passage is,â€”to convey the super- fluous Tears to the Nose, so as to prevent them from passing over the Cheek. The Ductus Incisivus, vel Nasalo-Palatinus of Steno, is a small Canal, which, as has already been observed in the Description of the Bones, is only sometimes met

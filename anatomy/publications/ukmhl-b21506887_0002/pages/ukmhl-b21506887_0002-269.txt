Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. S19 were found full of it. Yet the Author has seen a few Absorbents filled with a white Fluid like Chyle, on the Stomach of a Dog fed with Milk some hours before death. The Nerves are chiefly from the Eighth Pair, and partly from the Great Sympathetics, and are most nu- merous upon the Cardia. The Stomach receives the Food from the Esophagus, and afterwards prepares it, by Digestion, for the In- testines. The Digestion of the Food in the Stomach is found to be effected,—by Triture, which is performed by the motions of the Stomach, and Muscles of the Abdomen and Diaphragm,—by Dilution,—by a partial Fermen- tation,—but chiefly by the Solvent Power of the Gas- tric Juice. With respect to the real nature of the Gastric Juice, Authors are not yet sufficiently informed ; partly owing to the difficulty of obtaining it pure and un- mixed with the Saliva, &c. and in sufficient quantity. It appears from experiments, that it is adapted to the Food on which the Animal is accustomed to live, and of course, is diff*erent in diff*erent classes. In young Animals in particular, it has the power of coagulating Milk, and it is found to act entirely in a chemical manner, for it operates not only on the Ali- ments in the Stomach, but on the dead Animal Fibre out of the body ; and, in several instances, part of the Stomach itself has been found dissolved by it after death. The Gastric Juice is also observed to have an anti- septic quality, as it arrests the progress of putrefaction where that has begun.

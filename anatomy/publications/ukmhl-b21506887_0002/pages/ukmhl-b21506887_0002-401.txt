Fakt IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 325 Contents of the Uterus about the End of Pregnancy. The Contents of the Uterus, towards the end of Pregnancy, consist of the Foetus, the Umbilical Cord, Placenta, Membranes, and Waters, all of which are discharged at each Delivery. The Cord, Placenta, and Membranes, are named the SecundineSy or After-birth, with which some include the Waters, though these are discharged previously to the expulsion of the Child. The Cord is fixed by one end to the Umbilicus of the Foetus, and by the other it is attached to the Pla- centa, at a little distance from the middle of this Or- gan ; from which last circumstance the extraction of the Placenta is more easily effected. It is commonly about two feet in length,â€”sometimes considerably shorter, and often much longer; but in general it is sufficiently long to allow the Birth of the Child, while the Placenta adheres to the Uterus of the Mother. Its thickness is nearly equal to that of one^s Finger, but it is smaller and weaker at the extremity next the Placenta. It is seldom of a Cylindrical form, being marked with^Sulci corresponding to the course of its Vessels. It is composed of two Arteries and one Vein, the Vessels running in a spiral direction, like the twisting of a rope; in consequence of which the impetus of the Blood is broken in its course to the Child, or to the Placenta. ;v

lU COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. of the Nose. The Mucus defends the Nerves, which are almost naked, from the Air which is respired. By this Fluid they are kept moist, and free from pain; but, by becoming acrid, it irritates them^ and excites sneezing for its removal. The Air, filled with subtile Effluvia of Odorous Bo- dies, is, by the power of Inspiration, drawn through the Nose, and applied to the Pulpy Extremities of the Nerves, in which the Sensation is excited termed Smell- ing.â€”By this Sense^ the several kinds of Odoriferous Bodies are distinguished, and the more readily^ in pro- portion to the extent of the Mucous Membrane. Of the different parts of this Membrane, that cover- ing the Septum Narium and Ossa Spongiosa appears to be the principal seat of the Organ of Smelling, since upon it the greater part of the Nerves of the Internal Nares are distributed ; and this part of the Membrane, and the Bones it covers, are expanded and multiplied, in proportion to the acuteness of Smell, in quick-scent- ed Animals. The Sinuses leading into the Nose increase and mo- dulate the Voice; their hollow structure renders the Bones lighter ; they separate a Fluid, which assists in lubricating part of the Nose, but do not appear to con^ stitute part of the Organ of Smelling.

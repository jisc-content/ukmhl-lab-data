Tart IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 249 It Extends from the Sinus Portarum, where the Cer- vix is situated, to the anterior edge of the Liver, and, when distended, advances beyond the edge of that Or- gan, so as to touch the Cartilage of the Ninth Rib, and sometimes to have its Fundus opposed to the soft parts of the Abdomen, under the edge of the False Ribs. The Fundus, which is the larger extremity, is a little lower than the Cervix, when a Person is in the erect posture. It then also inclines a little to the right side, and rests upon the Colon at the beginning of the Duodenum. The Gail-Bladder is composed of several Coats^ the external of which is a continuation of the Membrane of the Liver. This, however, is but a partial one, cover- ing that part of the Gall-Bladder only which is not at- tached to the Surface of the Liver.â€”It serves to give strength to the Gall-Bladder, and to fix it to the Liver. Under the former Coat, a few pale scattered Fibres, running in various directions, are sometimes observed, which have been considered as a Muscular Coat; and under this there is some Cellular Substance, intermixed with a Plexus of Vessels, which has obtained the name of Nervous Coat. The Inner Coat, sometimes called Villous or Mucous, is full of Reticular Rugae or Folds, appearing some- what like the cells of a honey-comb. The Cells be- come extremely minute towards the Cervix, where they run in a longitudinal direction. The Surface of this Coat is every where perforated by the Ducts of small Follicles, which discharge a Viscid Mucus, to defend it from the stimulant nature of the Bile.

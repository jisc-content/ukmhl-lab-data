19S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. sponding Vein. The part of the Artery on the side of the Ligature next the Heart then swells, while that on the other side of the Ligature becomes collapsed. The reverse of these circumstances takes place in the Veins, the Blood being now interrupted in its course. The Circulation is also shewn by the aid of a Micro- scope, in the Blood-vessels of transparent parts of small Animals, as the Foot of a Frog. In the dead Body, by Injections thrown into the Arteries, it can be made to return by the Veins. Constituent Parts of the Blood. The Blood has a saponaceous feel, a saline taste, and a peculiar smell. When circulating through the Body, if it be exposed to a Microscope, it has the appear- ance of Globules diffused through a liquid. The Blood, when drawn from an Artery, is of a bright red; when taken from a Vein, it is of a deep purple colour ; but when the Venous Blood is exposed to the Air, it assumes the colour of Arterious Blood. It becomes florid upon exposure to Oxygen, and is darkened by the noxious Gases. When taken from the Body, and allowed for some time to remain at rest, it coagulates into a Mass of the consistence of curdled Milk. This separates into a thin fluid, called Serum, and a Coagulum termed Clot, Cruor, or Crassamentum, of which there is commonly about three parts of the latter to one of the former, but the proportions vary much in different Animals, and in the same Animal placed under different circum- stances.

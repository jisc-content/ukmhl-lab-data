Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, 535 stance, situated in the upper part of the Thorax, be- tween the Layers of the Anterior Mediastinum. It lies over the top of the Pericardium, and upon the Arch of the Aorta, the roots of the Carotid and Subclavian Arteries, and extends a short way into the fore part of the Neck. It has tivo Long Cornua above, and two Broad Lobes below ; is of a pale red colour, and becomes afterwards of a darker hue.

Some Anatomists are of opinion, that the white Fluid is Chyle sent by a retrograde motion from the Thoracic Duct, and that the Thymus Gland is a Di- verticulum to the Chyle, when too great a quantity of Lymph is sent to the Subclavian Vein. Part of the Thymus Gland frequently remains dis- tinct in young Adults; but in Persons advanced in life, it is so completely absorbed, that scarcely any thing but Cellular Substance remains in its place. The Blood-vessels of the Thymus are Branches of the Subclavian and Internal Mammary; the Nerve;^ come from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair. Its Lymphatics have not yet been very accurately traced. The Lungs are small, firm, and dense, of a dark red colour, their weight to Water is as 22 to 21; they there- fore sink when thrown into it, in consequence of the Bronchial Cells having not yet received Air, no Respi- ration taking place in the Womb. But if Air be ad-

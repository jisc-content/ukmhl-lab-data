SOO COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Rugae run in an oblique transverse direction, and are formed, not only by the Inner Membrane, but also by the Fibres which compose the Body of the Uterus. Between the Rugae are many small Follicles^ which discharge a Mucus for lubricating the parts near which they are placed :â€”Some of them, being of a roundish form, were mistaken by Naboth for Female Ovula. The under part of the Cervix projects into the Va- gina, somewhat in form of the Glans Penis, and is per- forated by a transverse Slit, termed Os Internum Uteri; or, from the resemblance of this part to the Mouth of the Tench, Os Tincoe. The Os Tincoe^ in a Virgin Uterus, is about the size of the Orifice of the Urethra in a Male, but nearly twice as large in the Uterus of a VV^oman who has born Children. It is smooth on its external Surface, is placed oblique- ly, in a direction towards the back part of the Vagina, and is surrounded with several Mucous Follicles. The Appendages of the Uterus are, the Ligamenta Lata^ Ligamenta Rotunda, the Ovaria, the Fallopian Tubes, and the Vagina. The Ligamenta Lata, termed sometimes Alee Ves- pertiUonis, are two Membranous Productions or Doub- lings of the Peritoneum, sent from the edges of the Uterus and posterior extremity of the Vagina, in a transverse direction, to be fixed to, and to line the sides of the Pelvis. The Anterior Layer of these Ligaments is continued to the sides of the Bladder, and the posterior is conti- nued in a similar manner to the Rectum, these two pro- ductions of the Peritoneum terminating below in two

134 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Grooves are narrow and deep at the fore part of the Jaws, and become wider and more shallow towards their posterior extremities. In the bottom of the Groove of the Lower Jaw, the Inferior Maxillary Vessels and Nerves are placed, which have afterwards a Canal peculiar to themselves. Within the Alveolar Grooves, there are, at this time, Ridges across, which gradually extend from the bottom and inner sides, forming Arches ; and the Cavities be- coming deeper, their external Openings contract, till at the time of Birth, when they are almost closed. In consequence of this, considerable pressure can be made in the time of Suction, without injuring the tender Teeth which the Cavities contain. The Alveoli of the Molares are produced directly before the roots of the Coronoid Processes of the Un- der Jaw, and in the Bulges or Tubers of the Upper one, and come forwards as the Jaws increase in length and size. In a Foetus of about four Months, small Pulpy Pro- cesses are found to proceed from the inner Surface of the Gums, and to be lodged in the Alveolar Grooves of both Jaws. These are the Rudiments of the future Teeth. At this time they are of a Gelatinous or Pulpy na- ture, resembling in shape the Bodies of the Teeth which are to be formed in them ; each contained in a Membranous Capsule proper to itself. By degrees the Pulp becomes firmer, and extremely Vascular; and having increased nearly to the size of the Body of the Tooth, Bone is deposited upon its extreme

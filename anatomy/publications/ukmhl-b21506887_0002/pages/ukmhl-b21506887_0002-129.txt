Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c, 95 which is the Orifice of the Aquaeductus Vestibuli, is placed behind. In the Vestibule there are several Holes which com- municate with the neighbouring parts, viz. The Fenestra Ovalis^ situated at the outside, by which it communicates with the Tympanum. The Fenestra Rotunda^ situated at the fore and un- der part, by which it communicates with one of the Canals of the Cochlea. Five similar Foramina behind, by which it commu- nicates with the Semicircular Canals. Towards the Meatus Auditorius Internus, it has four or five Cribriform Perforations^ for the transmis- sion of Nerves. The Cochlea is placed obliquely, next the anterior extremity of the Os Petrosum, and at the fore part of the Vestibule, in such a manner as to have its Base to- wards the Meatus Auditorius Internus, and its Apex in the opposite direction, or facing outwards. It has two Canals or Gyri, called ScalcB, from a sup- posed resemblance to a stair-case; one of which is placed on the outer and fore side, the other on the inner and back part. The Gyri are very close to each other, and run in a spiral direction, like the turns in the shell of a Snail, from which the part has obtained its name. The Cochlea forms two Circumvolutions or Turns and a half^ the first of which is much larger and wider than the other turn and a half, which become suddenly smaller, the whole approaching to a globular form. The two Canals are upon the same level, the inner one next the Base, and the outer next the point of the Cochlea.

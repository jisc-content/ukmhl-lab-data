188 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Aorta passes upwards from the top of the Left Ventricle, and is situated first behind, and then on the right side of the Pulmonary Artery, and between it and the Superior Cava. It bears nearly the same proportion in thickness and strength to the Pulmonary Artery, which the sides of the Left Ventricle do to those of the Right. Where the Aorta is about to send off the first of its large Branches at the top of the Thorax, it is of great size, and is sometimes called the Large Sinus of Val- salva. The Aorta receives the Blood from the Left Ventri- cle, and, by its Muscular contraction, re-acts upon it, and assists the Ventricle in sending it by numberless Branches through the different parts of the Body, from whence it is returned by the Veins to the Right Auricle. Besides the Blood-vessels already taken notice of, and which are common to the Heart and the rest of the Body, the Heart is furnished with Vessels peculiar to itself, termed Cardiac or Coronary^ from a Corona which they form upon its Surface. The Coronary Vessels consist of two Arteries, a right and left, and one principal Vein. The Coronary Arteries^ which are about the size of Crow-quills, arise from the Sinuses of the Mouth of the Aorta, opposite to two of the Semilunar Valves. One runs in a Groove between the right Auricle and Ventricle, and supplies chiefly the right side of the Heart. The other passes partly between the Left Auricle and Ventricle, and partly in the Groove between the Ventricles on the fore side of the Heart,â€”supplying

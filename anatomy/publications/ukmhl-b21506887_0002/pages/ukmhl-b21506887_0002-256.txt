g06 COMPENDIUM OP ANATOMY. [Part IV. is Also furnished with numerous Foramina, which dis- ehat-ge a Mucus from corresponding Glands, for lubri- cating the passage, and facilitating Deglutition. The Arteries of the Esophagus are Branches of the Inferior Laryngeals, and supply the Cervical part of it, and the Esophageals and Branches of the Bron- ehials, which are derived from the Aorta Descendens^ and supply the Thoracic Portion. The Veins go to the Inferior Laryngeals, to the Vena Azygos, and to the Left Superior Intercostal Vein. The Absorbents are numerous, and intermix with those of the Heart and Lungs. The Nerves are chiefly from the Eighth Pair. The Esophagus receives the Aliments from the Pha- rynx, and conveys them to the Stomach. Thoracic Duct. The Thoracic Duct is a small Membranous-like Canal, situated at the back part of the Thorax, and is the principal Trunk of the Absorbent System. It begins upon the third Vertebra of the Loins, and passes behind the Aorta, crossing obliquely from left to right, till it gets to the right side of that Artery. Upon the first Lumbar Vertebra, it forms an Oval Sac, termed Receptaculum Chyli, which is placed be- hind the Right Crus of the Diaphragm, and a little higher than the Right Renal Artery. The Duct afterwards passes between the Crura of the Diaphragm, and ascends in the Thorax, on the anterior part of the Spine, between the Layers of the Posterior

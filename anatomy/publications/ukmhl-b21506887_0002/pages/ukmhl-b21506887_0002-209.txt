Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 161 Women can suckle their children while carrying them on their backs. After the age of forty-five, or from that to fifty,— the period when the Menses generally disappear,— they decrease in size, and become soft and flaccid. Under the Skin there is a large quantity of Fat, which constitutes a considerable portion of the bulk of the Mamma. It defends the Glandular part, but is not found to pass into or communicate with the Lacti- ferous Ducts, which some have asserted. On the quantity of Fat in the Mamma, much of the Bulk of the Breast depends; from this circumstance, a Woman with small Breasts frequently produces more Milk in suckling, than those whose Mammae are of a larger size. The Glandular part of the Mamma is of a whitish colour, is of the Conglomerate kind, and therefore ir- regular in its Substance. It is composed of Lobes and Lobules, or of a num- ber of smaller Masses or Glands, which are separated by Fat, and these again are divided into still smaller parts, in which the Milk is originally secreted. Near the centre of the Mamma, but a little towards the outside, is the Papilla or Nipple, which is of a Cy- lindrical form, and of a redder colour than the rest of the Integuments of the Breast. It has a delicate Skin, and is extremely sensible. It is of different sizes in different ages and constitu- tions, and is always larger in the time of Gestation, or of Nursing. It is capable of distension from titillation, or when influenced by the Passions. VOL. II. L

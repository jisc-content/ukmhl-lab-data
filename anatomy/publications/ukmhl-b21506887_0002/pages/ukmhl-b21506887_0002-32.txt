W COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Falx supports the Tentorium, and is consider- ed as preventing the two sides of the Brain from press- ing upon each other, though there have been instances where part, or even the whole, of this Process has been wanting. The Tentorium Cerebelli, or Transverse Sep- tum, or Lateral Processes of the Dura Mater. The Tentorium is continued laterally from the Falx, is connected behind to the inner Transverse Ridges and Grooves of the Occipital Bone, and, at the fore and outer edges, to the ridges and great angles of the Petrosal parts of the Temporal Bones, and terminates at the posterior Clinoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone. Between the middle and inner edges of the Tento- rium and Posterior Clinoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone, there is a large Notch, or Foramen Ovale, where the Cerebrum and Cerebellum are united, or where the Tuber Annulare is chiefly situated. The Tentorium keeps the Falx te7ise, and forms a Floor or Vault over tlxe Cerebellum, which prevents the Cerebrum from pressing upon it. The Falx Minor, vel Septum Cerebelli, which is placed between the Lobes of the Cerebellum. It de- scends from the under and back part of the Falx and middle of the Tentorium, adheres to the inferior Lon- gitudinal Spine of the Os Occipitis, and terminates in- sensibly at the posterior edge of the Foramen Magnum of that Bone. Besides the Processes of the Dura Mater already de- scribed, there are four of inferior consideration, two of

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. a Serum, which is discharged into Cells in the Placenta, and that this is absorbed by Lymphatic Vessels exist- ing in the Placenta and Umbilical Cord. DrLavagni has found, that the Blood collectedfrom the Umbilical Vein contains a considerable proportion of Fibrin, while that from the Umbilical Arteries con- tains a very small one, from which he concludes, that the Uterus, in a gravid state, acquires the power of furnishing Blood provided with Fibrin, which is ab- stracted from it by the Embryo, for its own use. The Membranes consist of the Spongy Chorion, or Decidua, the True Chorion, and the Amnios ; and these are so closely connected to each other, as to appear at first sight as a single Layer; but they can be readily peeled off from each other. The Placenta and Membranes form a complete Bag, which lines the Cavity of the Uterus, and incloses the Foetus, Umbilical Cord, and Waters. The Spongy Chorionic a thick opake Substance, which adheres to the inner Surface of the Uterus, but sepa- rates from it at each Delivery. It forms the outer Layer of the Ovum, but scarcely penetrates between the Lobules of the Placenta, though, in the early Months, it enters more into the composition of that Substance. Between the Uterus and Placenta it is less distinct than elsewhere, being perforated there, and in some degree concealed by the Blood-vessels proceeding from the inside of the Uterus. It has a Spongy and Villous appearance, and is full of small Blood-vessels, wliich can be readily injected from those of the Uterus. The Trite Chorion is thinner, smoother, and much

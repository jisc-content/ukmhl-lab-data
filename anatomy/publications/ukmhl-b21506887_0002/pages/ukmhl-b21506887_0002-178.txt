136 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. is by degrees diminished, and in proportion as it is les- sened, part of the Pulp is pushed out or elongated, and assumes the part of the respective Fang. Upon this Pulp also Bone is deposited. While the Fang is extending, the socket is found to accommodate itself to it, by extending along with it till the Fang is completed. Where there are two or more Fangs, the Osseous Fibres shoot across at the Cervix, and form the begin- ning of these, after which the Ossification of each Fang advances in the same manner as that of a Tooth with a single root. At Birth, the Capsules containing the Pulps of the Teeth can be separated into two Membranes, the exter- nal of which is of a spongy and somewhat Vascular na-, ture, and adheres to the Gums, while the internal, smoother and firmer than the other, and extremely Vascular, adheres to the Pulp. The Membrane of the Pulp derives its Vessels from those of the Gums ; the Pulp receives its Vessels from those which enter the Foramina at the points of the Fangs. The Membrane containing the Pulp is firmly attach- ed to the inside of the Gums, and to the Basis of the Pulp, and has the same form with the Tooth it in- closes. The Vascularity of the Pulp is shewn by Injection, as is also that of the Membrane by which it is cover- ed ; and this appearance is rendered still more evident by examining the growing Teeth of large Animals, as those of an Elephant.

i34 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Structijre of the Small Intestines in particular. The Duodenum is the most lax, and the straightest of the Small Intestines, and so large as to have been considered as a Ventrieulu^ Succenturiatus, or Secon^ dary StomacTi. It is of a redder colour than the rest, has a thicker Muscular Coat, receives only a partial covering from the Peritoneum, and is fixed more closely to the Body, without floating like the other Intestines. It is perforated at the distance of three or four inches from the Pylorus, by the ends of the Biliary and Pancreatic Ducts, for the reception of Bile and Pancreatic Juice. On the Duodenum, the Lacteal Vessels begin to make their appearance, and numerous Mucous Glands are found in it, especially near the Pylorus. The inner Surface presents only some irregular Bugas, in place of Valvulas Conniventes. The Duodenum receives the Food from the Sto- mach, and detains it till it is mixed with the Bile and Pancreatic Juice. The Jejunum differs from the Duodenum in de- riving its common coat wholly from the Peritoneum,— in being smaller,—in having a weak Muscular Coat, the external Fibres of which are extremely minute,— and in the Valvulae Conniventes, Villi, and Lacteals, which proceed from them, being much more conspicu- ous and numerous. The Ilium differs from the Jejunum, in being less in diameter, in its Coats being thinner and of a pale colour,

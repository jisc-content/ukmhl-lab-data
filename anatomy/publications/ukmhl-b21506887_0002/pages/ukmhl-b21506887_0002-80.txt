The Puncta Lacrymalia are two small Orifices plac- ed near the inner Angle of the Eye, one in the upper, the other in the under Eye-lid, at the extremity of the Tarsus, and opposite to each other. Each Punctum is seated obliquely upon a little emi- nence, and is surrounded by a Cartilaginous Circle, which keeps it constantly open. The Puncta Lacrymalia are the Orifices of two small Canals, which have been termed Cornua lAmacum. These, after going a little across at their beginning, make a sharp Angle, and run in the direction of the edges of the Eye-lids towards the side of the Nose, where they approach each other. They terminate to- gether, sometimes by a common Duct, but more fre- quently by distinct openings, in the Lacrymal Sac, which will be described under the article Nose. The Tears which remain after moistening the Eye are absorbed by the Puncta, after the manner of Capil- lary attraction, and are conveyed through their Ducts into the Lacrymal Sac by the impulse of the Eye-lids. The Tears are transparent, colourless, and saltish to the Taste; and consist of Water and Mucus, mixed with a small proportion of Saline Matter. Caruncula Lacrymalis. The Caruncula Lacrymalis is a small Gland of a red-

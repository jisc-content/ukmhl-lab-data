S06 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Graaf under the name of Plexus Reteformis^ and by later Anatomists, under that of Corpus Cavernosum Vor- gince. The Corpora Cavernosa are covered by the Sphincter Vaginae, the action of which, joined to the dilatation of these Bodies, serves to contract the entry of the Va- gina in the time of Coition, The Vagina receives the Penis and Semen, and con- veys from the Uterus the Menstrual Flux, the Foetus, Secundines, and the Lochia. The Uterus, with its Ligaments, Ovaria, and Ute- rine Tubes, are supplied with Blood from the Sperma- tic and Uterine Arteries. The Spermatic Arteries arise from the Aorta, as in a Male, and descend for some way through the Ab- domen. They run next in the Ligamenta Lata, to be dispersed upon the Ovaria and Uterine Tubes, and afterwards upon the Fundus of the Uterus. In the progress of their course, they have a serpentine ap- pearance. The Uterine Arteries are derived from the internal Uiacs, and are much larger than the Spermatics. They direct their course, first to the under part of the Ute- rus, after which each splits into the proper .Uterine and the Vaginal Branches. The Uterine Arteries as- cend along the edges of the Uterus, and near its upper part join the Spermatics. The Vaginal Arteries run along the lateral parts of the Inner Portion of the Vagina. Chiefly from the Uterine, and partly from the Sper- Matic Arteries, many small Branches are|^furnished, which run in a Serpentine manner, and communicate

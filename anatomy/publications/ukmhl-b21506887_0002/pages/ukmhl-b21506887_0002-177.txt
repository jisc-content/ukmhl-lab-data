Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 135 points by the Blood-vessels, the Pulp itself continuing to grow for some time after this. About the fifth or sixth Month, Bone begins to ap- pear on that part of the Tooth which is afterwards to form the cutting Edges and grinding Surfaces, and in as many points as there are Eminences on the Pulp. The Ossification begins in the Incisores at three points, and in the others at points corresponding with the number of the future points of the Teeth. The Osseous points gradually increase, unite, and form a layer of Bone, which extends over the Surface of the Pulp to the Necks of the Teeth. Between the eighth and ninth Month, Ossification is considerably advanced in all the Pulps, and. In a full grown Foetus, the outer Shells of five Teeth in each side of each Jaw are found, which are termed Temporary^ Deciduous^ Shedding, or Milk Teeth. Of these there are in each side two Incisores, one Cus- pidatics, and two Molares; besides, there is the Shell of the Anterior Permanent Molaris; but the whole of the Temporary Teeth are much smaller than the corre- sponding classes in the Adult. In the Upper Jaw, the points or Eminences of the Shells correspond with the Depressions in the Teeth of the Under Jaw. After the outer Shell of a Tooth is formed, the Os- seous Matter gradually penetrates the greater part of the Pulp, and, having completed the Body, it con- tracts, and forms the Cervix. Having formed the Cervix, the Cavity of the Tooth

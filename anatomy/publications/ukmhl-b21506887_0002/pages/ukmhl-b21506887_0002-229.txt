Part I V.J OF THE VISCERA, &c. 179 strongest of them longitudinally with respect to the Ventricle; and are of various sizes, forming so many distinct Muscles, which are extremely compact in their structure, and compose a beautiful, intricate, and ir- regular net-work, that varies in appearance almost in every subject. In general, they adhere through their whole length to each other, or to the sides of the Ventricle, but many of them are loose in their middle, and may be raised by a Probe put under them. They assist the Ventricle, in its Systole or contrac- tion, render it stronger, prevent it from being over- stretched in its Diastole or dilatation, and agitate the Blood in its passage through the Ventricle, so as to mix its different parts freely together, and prevent Coagulation^ They are supposed to bring the opposite sides of the Ventricle completely together, during its contraction. The Columnas intersect each other in different direc- tions, and inclose many deep Grooves, Pits, or Foveoe, in the bottom of which there are still smaller Cavities. Into all of these the Blood readily enters. Around the Auricular Orifice of the Ventricle, there is a Tendinous Margin or Ring, from the whole edge of which a circular Membrane is sent off, called Valvula Tricuspis, vel Triglochin, from its having three prin- cipal but unequal points or divisions, though there are others, but they are less considerable. This is white, semi-transparent, and thin, but of great toughness and strength, and lies contiguous^to the sides of the Ventricle. From the whole edge of the Valve, next the point of M 2 #

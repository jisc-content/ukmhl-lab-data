196 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. this Common Cellular Substance, for when Air is blown into it, the Lobules are compressed ; but when the Air is blown in through a Branch of the Trachea, the Cells are again distended, and the Lobules recover their for- mer dimensions. In a F(Etus, the Cells are empty and in a collapsed state ;—but as soon as Respiration begins, they become distended, and continue so during life, and in every state of Respiration, and even in the recently dead Body:—But if an opening be made into the Cavity of the Thorax, whether in a living or dead Body, and the Air in this or in any other way freely admitted, they immediately collapse by their xveight and elasticity^ the pressure of the Air being then the same on the outer Surface of the Lungs, and inner Surface of the Trachea. The Lungs are covered by two Coats, an External or Common, and an Internal or Proper one. The Exterjial or Common Coat is a continuation or reflection of the Pleura, is extremely thin, but dense, and, like the other Parts of the Pleura, is found to pos- sess little Sensibility. It forms a general covering to the Lungs, but does not enter between their different Lobules. The Internal Proper Coat adheres so firmly to the former, as to appear, in an Adult, to constitute part of its Substance, but, in a young Subject, may be readi- ly separated from it. It not only covers the Lungs, but insinuates itself between their Lobes and Lobules, and is intimately connected with their Cellular Substance. Besides the Cells, various kinds of Vessels, viz. the Vessels or Branches of the Trachea, Blood-vessels, and

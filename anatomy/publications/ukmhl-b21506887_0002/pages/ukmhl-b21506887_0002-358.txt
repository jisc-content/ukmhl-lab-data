^82 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. when drawn out, are found to be several feet in length, and as small as so many fine Hairs. They are first collected into Bundles between the Septulae of the Testicle, and these again into others still smaller, each of the smaller being formed of a simple Tube, coiled up into a Conical form, with its Base forwards, and its Apex towards the posterior edge of the Testicle. h From the convoluted Seminal Tubes, an equal num- ber of straight Vessels are sent out at the back part of the Testicle, under the name of Vasa Recta. At the upper and back part of the Testicle, the Vasa Recta communicate, and form an irregular Plexus or Net-work, called Rete Vasculosum Testis. The Rete Testis sends out from twelve to eighteen straight Tubes, termed Vasa Efferentia, which carry the Semen from the Testicle to the Epididymis. Each Vas Efferens soon becomes convoluted, and forms a Conical Bundle with its Base towards the Epididymis, the whole getting the name of Coni Vas- culosi. The Coni Vasculosi are firmly connected by Cellular Substance, and are observed by De Monro, in his Treatise De Testibus^ to compose somewhat more than a third part of the Epididymis. The Vascular Cones gradually unite into a single Tube, which is many feet in length, and this, by its in- numerable convolutions, constitutes the rest of the Epi- didymis, and though only about the size of a Hog'^s Bristle, transmits the whole of the Semen of that Tes- ticle. The single Tube becomes larger in its course and

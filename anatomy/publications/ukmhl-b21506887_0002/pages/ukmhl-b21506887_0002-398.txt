3^2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. the Omentum and Intestines at the upper, lateral, and posterior parts of it, the fore side of the Uterus being in close contact with the Parietes of the Abdomen. In the progress of Gestation, the whole Uterus be- comes softer and looser, in consequence of which it readily changes its form, and accommodates itself to the pressure of the Child, or of any of the adjacent Viscera. It now becomes also more Vascular, and the Vessels are greatly enlarged in size ; the proportional increase being nearly similar to that of the bulk of the Uterus. The Arteries are now observed to have very fre-- quent communications, and in their course to be re- markably convoluted,—fully as much so as they are previous to Conception,^—and greatly more so than the corresponding Veins. The Veins are much larger than the Arteries, their diameters being such as to have distinguished them formerly by the name of Sinuses ;—and to them the great bulk of the Uterus is chiefly owing. The Lymphatic, like the Sanguiferous Vessels, are also much increased in size, as well as in number, to- wards the latter period of Pregnancy. Many of them are larger than Crow-quills. They form a Plexus, which covers a great part of the Body of the Uterus. The Substance of the Uterus was formerly supposed by some to be thicker, and by others to be thinner, in the Gravid, than in the unimpregnated state ; but it appears now to be fully ascertained, that it is nearly of the same thickness in both states, and during the whole term of Pregnancy, excepting at the end of Gestation, when it becomes thinner towards the under

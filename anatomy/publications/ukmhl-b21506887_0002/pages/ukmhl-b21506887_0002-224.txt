174 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. one Surface to the other, and the whole are so much twisted and folded, and so variously intermixed, as to render it difficult to unravel or describe them.—In ge- neral, however, their course is such as to lessen the Ca- vities of the Heart in all their dimensions. > The Cavities of the Heart are lined by a Membrane extremely thin, but dense and strong, to defend it a- gainst the pressure of the Blood, and to prevent the latter from insinuating itself between the Muscular Fi- bres of this Viscus. No Blood-vessels, Absorbents, nor Nerves, have yet been traced in this Membrane. The Heart is formed of an Anterior or Right, and a Posterior or Left side, or of a Right and a Left Hearty joined together by a Partition, which prevents the two sides from having any direct communication with each other.—The terms Bight and Left are, strictly speak- ing, more applicable to the Heart of Quadrupeds, and those of Anterior and Posterior to that of the Hu- man Body ; but as the Heart is placed obliquely, the Anterior Auricle and Ventricle are turned more to the right than the Posterior are, therefore the common terms of Right and Left may be still applied with pro- priety. The Right Heart belongs to the Lungs, and has, therefore, also the name of Pulmonic or Pulmonary; and the Left Heart to the rest of the Body, and is on that account called Systematic, and sometimes Aortic. Between the two Hearts there is a Furrow which marks the line of distinction externally. Each side of the Heart is furnished with a set of Veins, with an Auricle, a Ventricle, and an Artery, and also with two Sets of Valves, one of which is situated

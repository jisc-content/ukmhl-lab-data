COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [I*aiit IV, cular-like Plicae more distinct, and the Fimbriae more expanded than formerly. In the enlarged state of the Uterus, the Muscular Fibres, though pale, are distinctly seen. They form Fasciculi which run in different directions, but cannot be traced far without interruption. They are variously described by different Authors; their course, however, is such, that they are capable of contracting the Ute- rus in all its dimensions during the time of Delivery. According to Dr Huntee, the contractile power of the Muscular Fibres of the Uterus is in some parts slow, but in others quick ; in some parts voluntary, and in others involuntary. A description is given by Ruysch of a Circular Muscle in the bottom of the Uterus, for the expulsion of the Placenta ;â€”but the Placenta is found to adhere to other parts besides the Fundus Uteri; nor has such a Muscle been observed by later Anatomists. In Dr Hunter's Plates, the Fibres are seen running trans- versely in the Body of the Uterus, and describing Con- centric Circles about the Orifices of the Fallopian Tubes. The Muscular Fibres of the Uterus assist in the Delivery of the Child, and expulsion of the Placenta; and in a few weeks after Delivery, the Uterus, partly by the contractile powers of these Fibres, and partly by that of the Blood-vessels, is restored to near its former dimensions.

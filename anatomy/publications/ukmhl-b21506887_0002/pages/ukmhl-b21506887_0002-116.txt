82 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Antihelicc, Anthelix^ or inner Bar or Margin, which is situated within the former, and is composed superiorly of two Ridges, uniting together below. The Tragus, which is a small Eminence, lying over the Meatus Externus, and is connected to the under and fore part of the Helix. The Antitragus, placed opposite to the Tragus, and below the posterior extremity of the Antihelix. The Cavitas Innominata, situated between the Helix and Antihelix. The Scapha, or Fossa Namcularis, situated between the two limbs of the Antihelix. The Concha, which is a large Cavity under the An- tihelix ; divided by the Helix into two parts, the infe- rior of which leads to the Meatus Auditorius. The back part of the External Ear exhibits only one considerable Eminence, which is the convex Surface of the Concha. The Lobus, which is the inferior soft part of the Ear, is composed of Cellular Substance, with a small quan- tity of Fat. The Ear is covered by a continuation of the common Integuments, which are thinner here than on the rest of the Body, and are perforated in many parts by the Mouths of Sebaceous i3ucts, placed immediately under the Skin. The motions of the Ear, which are very limited, are regulated by several Muscles, some of which are com- mon to the Ear and Head, and others proper to the Ear itself.

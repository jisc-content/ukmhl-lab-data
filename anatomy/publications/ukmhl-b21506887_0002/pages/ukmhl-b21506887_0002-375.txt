Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 299 in breadth at the Fundus, and about half as broad at the Cervix.—It is near an inch in thickness, and is larger in Women who have born Children than in Vir- gins ; yet in the former, when in advanced life, it shrinks by degrees to nearly the size it had in the Virgin state. The Cavity, like the external part of the Uterus, is of a triangular form^ but is small in proportion to the size of the Organ,—being scarcely capable of contain- ing the Kernel of an Almond, and has its anterior and posterior Surfaces closely applied to each other. It is covered externally through its whole length with a smooth polished Coat, continued from the Peri- toneum, which also covers the posterior half of the under part of the Vagina, is reflected forwards upon the Bladder, backwards over the Rectum, and lateral- ly towards the sides of the Pelvis. In Substance it is of a compact. Cellular, and Fleshy nature, and plentifully supplied with Blood-vessels: The Fleshy Fibres, however, are only seen distinctly in the Gravid Uterus. It is remarkably Vascular in its Body, less so in its Cervix, and is nearly of the same thickness throughout, excepting at its corners, where the Uterine or Fallo- pian Tubes terminate. It is lined with a fine and very Vascular Membrane, of a somewhat Porous and Villous appearance, in which the Arteries terminate which discharge the Menstrual Fluid. The Cavity of the Cervix has two small Longitudi- nal Lines projecting in it, one in the anterior, the other in the posterior part^ on each side of which are xmrae- Yous Rugce,

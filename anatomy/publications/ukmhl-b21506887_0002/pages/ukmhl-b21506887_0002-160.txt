lis COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt IV. which take their origin from it, are very Vascular, espe- cially near the Apex of the Tongue, but are wanting on its under Surface. The PapillcB are divided into three kinds, the Maoci- mce, Medice, and Minimce. The first class, called Papillce MaooimcB^ Lenticula- res, Capitatoe^ vel Vallatce, are by much the largest, and of a Lenticular form, having round Heads and short Stems. They are placed at the base of the Tongue, in superficial Fossulae, and the whole are arranged in such a manner as to form an Angle with its point backwards. They are Glands of the Salivary kind, and each of them has a small Perforation in the middle of its con- Vex Surface. Besides the Papillae Capitatse, there are numerous Mucous Follicles, v/hich cover the greater part of the Surface of the root of the Tongue. At the root of the Tongue, and behind the Angle formed by the Papillae Maximse, there is a Hole called Foramen Ccecum of Morgagni, by whom it was first described. It penetrates only a small way into the Substance of the Tongue, and receives the Mouths of several Excre- tory 'Ducts which terminate in it. The second Class, called Papillce Medice, Semi-lenti- culares, vel Fungiformes, are much smaller than the former, and are scattered over the upper Surface of the Tongue, at some distance from each other. They are of a Cylindrical form, supported on a Small Pedicle, and terminated by a round extremity. The third class, called Papillce Minimce, vel Conicce,

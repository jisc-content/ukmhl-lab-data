64 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, Under the Corpus Ciliare, the Retina is so covered externally by the Pigmentum Nigrum, and adheres in- ternally so closely to the Capsule of the Vitreous Hu- mour, as to be prevented from being seen till the black Paint is washed off, or till all the Coats be removed posteriorly, and the Eye viewed through the medium of the Vitreous Humour. In the back part of the Retina, and on the side next the Choroid Coat, directly in the Axis of the Eye, there is a transparent Spot, which appears like a Foramen, surrounded by a yellow Border, that becomes paler to- wards the Circumference. This was first discovered by SoEMMEKRiNG, and is termed Foramen Centrale; but its nature is not yet understood. It is said to be peculiar to the Human Species and Ape. According to Blumenbach, it may serve as a kind of Pupil through which concentric rays may pass, and be ab- sorbed by the Pigmentum Nigrum of the Choroides, in those Animals which have the Axes of the Eyes pa- rallel to each other, and thereby see objects with both Eyes at once, but are in danger from this of being dazzled by strong light. The Retina is composed of a tender and Pulpy-like Substance, is semi-transparent, and of a light grey co- lour, resembling that of ground glass, but becoming a little firmer and more opake when immersed in Spirit of Wine. From the entrance of the Optic Nerve to the edge of the Corpus Ciliare, the Retina is uniform in its Sub- stance, and is so easily torn and separated from the edge of that Body, as to be described by many Au- thors as terminating there.

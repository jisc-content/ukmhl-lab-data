198 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. lating at their extremities, terminate in the Cell^ of the Lungs. The Cells of the Lungs, in a Child, are barely visible to the naked Eye. In an Adult they are larger, and in both they communicate so freely together, that upon introducing Air into a Bronchial Tube of moderate size, a large Portion of the Lungs may be inflated. The Trachea consists of Cartilaginous Rings, about sixteen or eighteen in number, the number varying a little according to the length of the Neck. The Cartilages give strength and firmness to the Trachea, and preserve it constantly open for the trans- mission of Air, They are incomplete, however, behind, where the Trachea is formed of a Jlat, soft, Jieshy Sub- stance, which is closely connected with the Esophagus, and yields to it in the time of Deglutition. Each Cartilage forms a large Segment, or nearly two-thirds of a Circle, about a line or one-twelfth of an inch in breadth, and a fourth of a line in thickness. The Cartilages are situated transversely, with respect to the length of the Trachea, and have their edges op- posed to each other ; small spaces intervening. They are united to each other by a Ligamentous Substance, which is so elastic, that when the Lungs ar^ taken out of the Body, it draws the Cartilages closely together. At the upper end of the Trachea, two or three of th$ Cartilages are frequently joined by a union of Sub- stance ; but below this, they are perfectly distinct from each other. The last of the Cartilages is now and then triangular, to adapt itself more readily to the beginning »f th€ Bronchi.

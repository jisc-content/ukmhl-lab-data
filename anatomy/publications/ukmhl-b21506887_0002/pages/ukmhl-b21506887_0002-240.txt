190 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. ing Injections, thrown into these Vessels, do not appear to detect any such terminations. The Absorbents of the Heart go to the neighbouring Lymphatic Glands. Nerms are from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair. With regard to the Circulation of the Blood in gene- ral:â€”^^The Veins, by a slow and equal motion, and without Pulsation, return the Blood from the different parts of the Body to the Auricles, which serve as Re- servoirs of this Fluid. Immediately after receiving it, the Auricles, on account of the quantity and stimulat- ing quality of the Blood, contract suddenly, and at the same time, and send it to the Ventricles, which, hav- ing discharged their Contents, are ready to receive it: Its reflux is prevented by means of the Valves. The Ventricles, from the same cause which stimulates the Auricles, and on account of the stroke the former receive from the latter, contract convulsively, with a force proportioned to the thickness of their sides; and, like a forcing Machine, send the Blood to the Pulmo- nary Artery and Aorta, or Arterious System in general, which, in dilating to receive it, have a pulsatory mo- tion : Its reflux is prevented by the Semilunar Valves. During the contraction of the Ventricles, these are thrown, by the dilating Auricles and Arch of the Aorta, against the Ribs, where the Stroke occasioned by the Pulse of the Heart may be felt. The Arteries, by their contractile power and elas- ticity, send the Blood suddenly to the Veins, through which, by the united force of the Ventricles and Arte- ries, called the Vis a tergo^ by the pressure of the sur-

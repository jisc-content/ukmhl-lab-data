Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 85 middle, and from an inch to an inch and a half in length. Its outer end, which is a continuation of the Concha, is Cartilaginous, and has two or three Interruptwns or Fissures in it. On the upper and back part of its circumference, there is a Large Interruption terminating in an oblique Margin, which is fixed to the rough edge of the under part of the Osseous Portion of the Meatus. At the superior and posterior part of the Meatus, the Cartilage has but little connexion with the Bone, being there fixed by the Skin which lines the Canal. The Osseous is continued from the Cartilaginous part of the Canal, and is the longer of the two, parti- cularly at its upper and back part. The Meatus is lined with a continuation of the Skin, which fills up the Interruption in the Cartilage, but, like the Skin covering the Auricle, it is thinner than on the rest of the Body. Between the inner lining and Cartilage of the outer half of the Meatus, there are numerous small Glands, of a yellowish colour, placed in a Reticular Substance formed by the Corpus Mucosum, and termed Glandules CeruminoscB. These discharge the Wax of the Ear through small Excretory Ducts. The wax lubricates the Passage, and defends it from injury, and, being of a viscid and bitter quality, assists in the exclusion of insects. The Arteries of the External Ear come anteriorly from the Temporal, and posteriorly from the Occipi- tal ; both of which are Branches of the Externla Caro, tid Artery.

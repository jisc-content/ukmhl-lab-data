3^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. low to the Fornix, and forms a distinct Partition be- tween the Lateral Ventricles. It is composed of two Cineritious and Medullary Lamince, more or less separated from each other at their upper and fore part, by a small Cavity, about a quarter of an inch in length, called Fissure, or Fossa of Sylvius, or Sinus of the Septum Lucidum. This Cavity is considered by some as a Fifili Ven- tricle. It does not, however, communicate with the other Ventricles, though, in some Subjects, it reaches a considerable way backwards, and, as well as the other Cavities of the Brain, has been found full of water in cases of Hydrocephalus. Under the Septum Lucidum is placed the Substance which has been compared in shape to a FawZ^ by the Ancients, and from that has obtained the name of For- nix, The Fornix is merely a continuation of the Corpus Callosum and Septum* Lucidum, and forms a sort of hollow Ceiling, with four Pillars, called Crura or Cor- nua, from their winding direction, of which there are two anterior, and two posterior. The two Anterior Crura are short, run close toge- ther, and become enlarged at their inferior parts. The two Posterior Cru7^a are long, at a considerable distance from each other, and form Curvatures which correspond with the course of the Inferior Cornua of the Lateral Ventricles. That part of the Crura Fornicis lying in the Inferior Cornua of these Ventricles, forms thin puckered bor- ders getting the name of Corpora Fimbrlata ;â€”but, ac- cording to Vic D'Azyh, they are more properly termed

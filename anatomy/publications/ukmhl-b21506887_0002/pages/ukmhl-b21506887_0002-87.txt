Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 59 Tunica Choroides. The Choroides lies under the Sclerotica^ and is con- nected to it by the Trunks of Vessels and Nerves which pass from the one Coat to the other, and also by a tender Cellular Substance, of a brown colour, which tinges the inner Surface of the Sclerotica. It begins at the entrance of the Optic Nerve into the Eye, runs between the Sclerotica and Retina, near- ly to the Crystalline Lens, where it is more firmly connected to the Sclerotic Coat than it is elsewhere, by means of the Ciliary Circle. The Ciliary Circle, or Ciliary Ligament as it is call- ed, is composed of a quantity of condensed shining Cellular Substance, which forms a white Ring connect- ing the fore part of the Choroides, and the Root or outer margin of the Iris, to the Sclerotica. At the inner side of the Ciliary Circle, is the Canal of Font ANA, which is of a Triangular Shape, and is partly formed by the Groove at the inner edges of the Cornea and Sclerotica. The Choroid Coat is much thinner and more tender than the Sclerotic, and is one of the most Vascular parts 3f the Body, seeming at first sight to be entirely com- posed of Vessels.â€”The greater number of those on the outside run in whirls ; while those on the inside, tak- ing a direction forwards and nearly parallel to each 3ther, gave rise to the supposed existence of the Mevu brana Ruyschiana. It is also furnished with numerous Nerves, which are united with its Vessels by a fine Cellular Texture, and

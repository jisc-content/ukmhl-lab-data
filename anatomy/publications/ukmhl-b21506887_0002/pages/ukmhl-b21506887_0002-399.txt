After the third Month, the Cervix Uteri begins to become softer, wider, and more Spongy, and continues to do so till the seventh or eighth Month, when it is so expanded as to form part of the Body of the Uterus.

At the latter Months it becomes thin, flat, and irregular on its edges, and the firmness of its texture is converted into the Spongy softness of the Body of the Uterus.

There is now merely the Mucus as a Septum between the Ute- rus and Vagina ; this comes away before Parturition, along with the Liquor Amnii, the Follicles which form this Mucus throwing out, afterwards, a thinner fluid, to lubricate the parts. The situation of the Appendages of the Uterus is also considerably altered.

The Round Ligaments are thicker and more Vascular, and the Ligamenta Lata, by assisting in forming a Cover- ing to the Uterus, are nearly obliterated. The Tubes descend by the sides of the Uterus; are straighter, thicker, and more Vascular; have the Mus- ~ X 2

60 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. are seen running forwards flat, and in a parallel direc- tion upon its outer Surface. In the Human Eye, the Choroides is of a dusky brown colour, both externally and internally ; but the colour varies considerably in the Eyes of different Ani- mals. The inner Surface of this Coat, which is Villous, was described by Ruysch as a distinct Lamifia, and has been termed by many Anatomists Tunica Ruyschiana. 'â€”But Haller, Zinn, and many others who followed them, have demonstrated this Coat to consist of only one Lamina; though in Sheep, and some of the larger Animals, it appears to be double. Upon the inner side of the Choroides, there is a Mu- cus, the colour of which, in different Animals, is found to have some connexion with the general colour of the Hair and Skin, though commonly, in the Human Body, it is of a brownish black, and termed Pigmentum Ni- grum ; the darkness of the shade, however, still corre- sponding with that of the Hair, as appears very evi- dent in Negroes. It is supposed to be produced from the Vessels of this Coat, and is blackest and thickest at the fore part of the Eye, where it adheres so tenaciously as to be removed with difficulty; but behind it is thinner, more fluid, and more easily removed; becoming gradually less evident towards the Optic Nerve, around which it almost disappears. In advanced age, the Pigmentum Nigrum becomes more diluted, and of a lighter colour, so that the Ves- sels of the Choroid Coat may be seen shining through the Vitreous Humour.

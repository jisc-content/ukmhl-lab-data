PautIV.] of the viscera, &c. 33S Body, and the Bones of the Cranium are united by Membrane^ which admits of some alteration in the form of the Head, whereby its Passage is facilitated in the time of Delivery. The Cranium bears a large proportion to the Face in the Child, owing to the size of the Brain, and the want of Sinuses in the Head, and of Teeth in the Jaws ; and the younger the Embryo is, the greater is the dispro- portion between the Head and the rest of the Body. Between the Frontal and Parietal Bones, is the space called Bregma^ formed of a quadrangular Membranous Substance, which commonly disappears before the Child is two years of age, the margins of the Bones being then united. Between the middle of the Lambdoid^ and posterior extremity of the Sagittal Suture, a Membrane of a tri^ angular form is also described, and termed Posterior Bregma ; but this does not exist in the Head of a sound and healthy Child. —The other Peculiarities of the Bones of a Foetus are taken notice of along with the description of the Bones of an Adult.— The Fluids, in a Foetus, are proportionally larger in qiiantityj and the solids generally softer^ than in an Adult. The Skin is of a hright red colour^ in consequence of its greater degree of Vascularity, and is covered with an Unctuous Substance, which forms a Soap with Al* kalis, and is supposed to be secreted from the Vessels upon its Surface. That part chiefly of the Cellular Membrane is Ad\~ fose^ which is near the Surface of the Body; scarcely

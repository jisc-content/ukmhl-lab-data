A Protuberance eit the upper and back part of the Tympanum, formed by the Aquasductus Fallopii. A'Projection called Eminentia Pyramidalis Tym- pani, situated behind the Fenestra Ovalis, in which is the Passage for the Stapedius. An Eminence at the upper and fore part of the Tym- panum, containing a semi-canal, for lodging part of the Tensor Tympani. In the Tympanum there are various Passages, which communicate with the neighbouring parts, viz. The Iter a Potato ad Aurem, or Eustachian Tube, so named from the describer, though known to Aris- totle, which goes off from the upper and fore part of the Tympanum, and, running obliquely forwards and inwards to the posterior Opening of the Nostril, termi- nates at the outer edge of that opening, above the Arch of the Palate, the whole Tube being about an inch and a half in length. The posterior part of the Tube is Osseous, being formed in the Pars Petrosa, at the upper and outer part of the Canal for the Carotid Artery. The anterior portion is formed above, by the Spi- nous Process, and root of the Pterygoid Process of the Sphenoid Boneand below, by Cartilage and Mem- brane.

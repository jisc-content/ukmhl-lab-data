Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 107 The Cartilages of the Nose are moved in different directions, by the following Muscles on each side, which have already been described ; viz. the Compres- S07' Narium^ the Nasal part of the Frontal Muscle, and the Levator and Depressor Labii Superioris Alceque Nasi.â€”The Nose may also be moved by the neigh- bouring Muscles, which, in many instances, become assistants to the others. The Internal Nares, or Cavities of the Nose, extend upwards to the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid, and to the Body of the Sphenoid Bone. At the inner side, they are bounded by the Septum Narium, which is formed by the Nasal Lamella of the Ethmoid Bone, by the Vomer, and by the middle Car- tilage of the Nose. On the outside, or that next the Cheek, the Ossa Spongiosa project a considerable way into the Cavities of the Nares, and increase the Surface of the Mem- brane of the Nose for enlarging the Organ of Smell. In Animals which smell acutely, the Ossa Spongiosa are remarkably large and complex. The bottom of the Nostrils runs directly backwards, or goes in a horizontal direction in the erect position of the Body, so that a straight Probe may be passed through either of them to the Throat. In the fore part of the Nostrils there ate stiff Hairs, called Vibrissce, which prevent the Mucus from con- stantly flowing, and insects or other extraneous matter from entering. The general Cavity of each Nostril is divided by the Ossa Spongiosa into tJ^ree Meatus, or Passages, which

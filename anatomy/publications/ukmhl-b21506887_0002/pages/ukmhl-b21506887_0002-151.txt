?ART IV.] OE THE VISCERA, &c. 109 upper and back part of the Nose, near the openings of the Sphenoid Sinuses. The Sphenoid Sinuses open, behind the Cells of thd Ethmoid Bone, into the upper and back part of the Nose. The Maxillary Sinuses open at their upper and inner sides, each by one, and sometimes by two Passages, into the middle of the space between the Superior and Inferior Spongy Bones, nearly opposite to the under edge of the Orbit. At the upper part of the Maxillary Sinuses, Jppen^ dices, described by Haller, are sometimes found, which communicate with the Ethmoid Cells. The Sides, or Walls of the Maxillary Sinuses, are formed of thin Plates of Bone, excepting where the Processes project and give them additional strength; and below, the Bone is so thin between them and the Dentes Molares, that the roots of these Teeth are sometimes found to perforate the Septum. The different Sinuses are lined by a continuation of the Membrana Schneideriana ; but in these it is much thinner, and less Vascular and Nervous, than that part of it which lines the general Cavity of the Nose. They are constantly moistenedj but not filled with a Fluid. Their Passages, being directed backwards, prevent extraneous matter from getting into them. Lacrymdl Groor;^.-â€”-This is formed by the Superior Maxillary, Lacrymal, and Inferior Spongy Bones. In its descent, it runs a little obliquely backwards to the lower and lateral part of the Cavity of the Nose, where

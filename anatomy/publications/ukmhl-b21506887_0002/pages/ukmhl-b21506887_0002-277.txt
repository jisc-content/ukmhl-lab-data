Paet iv.j of the viscera, &c. m The Mesentery begins at the last turn of the Duo- denum, and runs obliquely downwards, and towards the right side, along the Vertebrae of the Loins, to the first, second, and third of which it is chiefly connected. Between the two Layers of the Mesentery, are in- closed a considerable quantity of Cellular Substance and Fat, with the numerous Blood-vessels, Nerves, Lac- teal Vessels, and Glands of the Jejunum and Ilium. Its anterior edge is inuch more extensive than the posterior, being plaited or puckered up,â€”the Plaits corresponding with the Convolutions of the Intestines to which they are fixed, and which they prevent from being entangled in the various motions of the Body. The Meso-colon is the continuation of the Mesentery, which, after reaching the lower extremity of the Ilium, contracts and obtains this name. It follows the Course of the Great Intestines, and fixes them in their place ; its different portions getting names from the parts of the Colon to which they are attached. Under the Right Kidney it is narrow and firm, and forms the Right Ligament of the Colon. Opposite to that Kidney, it appears to be lost by the immediate adhesion of the Colon to the Kidney and Duodenum. It then turns across, and forms a broad Expansion, which incloses the Arch of the Colon at its anterior edge; and behind, it separates and incloses the ante- rior part of the Duodenum, and is fixed to the Spine. It adheres a little to the under part of the left extre- mity of the Stomach, and then descends over the Left Kidney, at the under end of which it forms the Left p 2

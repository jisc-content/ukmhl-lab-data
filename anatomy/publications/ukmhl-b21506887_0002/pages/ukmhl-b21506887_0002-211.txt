Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 168 Glands which belong to the Internal Mammary Ves- sels. The Nerves are chiefly from the Axillary Plexus, a few Branches being also sent off from the Intercostals. From the extremities of the Arteries in the Sub- stance of the Mamma, numberless Tubes arise, called Ductus vel TubuU Lactiferi. They gradually unite into Trunks, which run in a radiated manner, and, be- coming greatly enlarged in the time of Suckling, serve as Reservoirs in which the Milk is contained. The Lactiferous Ducts are accompanied, in the Sub- stance of the Mamma, by a tough white elastic Sub- stance, which follows them to the Nipple. At the root of the Nipple they become contracted, and are there from twelve to eighteen and upwards in number. Either from the want of uniformity, however, with respect to their number in different Subjects, or from the difficulty of perceiving them, they have been va- riously estimated by different Authors. Near the root of the Nipple, they have been suppos- ed by Dr Meckel to form a Circle of communication; —but this has been ascribed, by still later Anatomists, to a laceration of Vessels. Numerous preparations and experiments,—particularly that of throwing in an In- jection at one Duct, and finding that it fills only one part of the Mamma, without returning by any other Duct,—seem sufficiently to indicate, that there is no such circular communication. In the Substance of the Nipple, the Lactiferous Tubes are at a little distance from each other, and are coiled up in such a manner, that the spontaneous flow / L 2

144 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Temporary Incisores and Cuspidati being much smaller than the Permanent, while the Temporary Mo- lares are larger than the Bicuspidati which succeed them, space is gained for the Front Teeth, which other- wise would be distorted in the Jaws. The Jaws grow uniformly throughout for about a year after birth, and as far as the Teeth extend, form nearly half of a circle ; after all the Temporary Teeth have appeared, the Jaws elongate, so that in the Adult they form half of a long Ellipsis. The extension which takes place between the last Temporary Molaris and the Goronoid Process, and in the corresponding parts of the Upper Jaw, continues to increase till the eighteenth or twentieth year, the anterior part of the J aw adapting itself to the Perma- nent Teeth, but scarcely receiving any additional size. Changes produced in the Teeth and Jaws as a Person advances in life. By degrees, as a Person advances in life, the Teeth are worn down by Friction during Mastication, and this appears more particularly in those whose Teeth have naturally been so short as not to overlap, but to meet each other at their cutting edges. While the Teeth are wearing down, the Vessels in their Pulp seem to assume a new action, in consequence of which, additional Bone is formed, the Pulp is ab- sorbed, and this Process continues till their Cavity is obliterated. In old People, when the Front Teeth overlap each other, and when extraneous Matter, as Tartar, has been f

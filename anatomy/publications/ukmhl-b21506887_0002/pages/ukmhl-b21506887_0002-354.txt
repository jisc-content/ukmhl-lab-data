278 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. lour, is, like the former Coat, originally a continuation of the Peritoneum, and invests the Body of the Tes- ticle closely. It is a thick, strong, dense, and inelastic Membrane, of a glistening appearance. It is remarkably smooth on the outside, but internal- ly it is rough and unequal, adhering every where firm- ly to the Body of the Testis. It covers both the Testis and Substance called Epi- didymis, connects them to each other, gives strength to them, and conducts their Vessels in the same manner as the Mesentery does those of the Intestines. The Body of the Testis is of a yellowish colour, and has a pulpy appearance,â€”is of an oval form, and a little flattened at its outer and inner sides. The Testes are larger after than before the age of Puberty. Fre- quently one Testicle, especially the right, is a little larger than the other. The Testes are placed obliquely, with one end up- wards and forwards, and the other end backwards and downwards. The Epididymis is situated at the outer and back part of the Testis, and is inclosed in the same covering with it. It begins at the upper part of the Testicle, imme- diately above the entry of the Blood-vessels ; and this part of it being large and of a round form, is termed Globus Major^ or Head of the Epididymis. In its descent, it becomes somewhat smaller and flatter, and is attached behind to the Body of the Tes- ticle, where the Blood-vessels enter; but it is loose at its fore part, the Tunica Albuginea dipping in this

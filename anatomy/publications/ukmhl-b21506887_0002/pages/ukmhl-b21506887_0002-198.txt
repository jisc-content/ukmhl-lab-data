156 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. duced 'by the Muscles belonging to these parts.—On the above circumstances are supposed to depend the acuteness of the Voice in Females, in Children, and in Eunuchs, where the Larynx is less expanded than in Adult Males. A Tone is gram in proportion to the reverse of the above. Speech is performed chiefly by the different parts of the Mouth, assisted by the Cavity of the Nose,-—the Larynx moving only in a small degree. When the Air passes through the Larynx without producing a tremor, it occasions a Whisper. VV^hen a person speaks during Inspiration, the Voice is thereby very materially altered, and, by practice, may be made to appear as coming from other places than the Mouth of the Speaker ; as is the case with those who call themselves Ventriloquists. Thyroid Gland. The Thyroid Gland has its name from its connexion with the Thyroid Cartilage, though more immediately connected with the Trachea. It is a large mass, but varying in size in different persons; is of a deep red colour, is situated at the under and fore part of the Larynx, behind the Sterno- hyoidei and Sterno-thyroidei, and is proportionally larger in Man than in any other Animal. It has two triangular Lobes, with their Bases under- most, placed at the under and lateral parts of the La- rynx, descending over two or three Rings of the Tra- chea, and also over part of the Esojihagus.

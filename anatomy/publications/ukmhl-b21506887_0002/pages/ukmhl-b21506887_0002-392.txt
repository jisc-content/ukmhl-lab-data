316 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. lamentous and Spongy Substance, named by Ruysch Tunica Filamentosa, and by more modern Authors, the False or Spongy Chorion. The Spongy Chorion is described by Dr Hunter as consisting, in early Gestation, of two Layers ; one lining the Cavity of the Uterus, and termed by him Memhrana Decidua, from being supposed to be cast off from the Uterus ; the other, covering the outer Sur- face of the True Chorion, he terms Decidua Rejlesca, the one appearing to be a continuation of, or reflection from, the other; of course, four Layers or Coats are found in the beginning of Pregnancy. The Decidua is least distinct between the Uterus and Placenta, being there perforated by the Uterine Ves- sels. Near the edge of the Placenta, the Decidua and that part of it called Reflexa^ are thickest and strong- est, and decrease in thickness towards the other end of the Uterus and Ovum, in proportion as these become more expanded. In advanced Gestation, the inner Surface of the De- cidua, and outer one of the Decidua Reflexa, gradual- ly approach each other, and unite into one Membrane, which retains the name of Spongy Chorion^ or Decidua. They have been supposed to be formed originally by an efflorescence thrown out upon the parts on which they are placed, in the manner it is thrown out upon inflamed Surfaces. Between the Amnios and Chorion, a large proportion of Gelatinous Fluid is contained in the early Months, which separates them at a considerable distance from each other. At this period a small Bag^ filled with a milky-like Fluid, is observed on the Amnios, near the

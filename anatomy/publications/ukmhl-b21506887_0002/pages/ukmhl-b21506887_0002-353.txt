Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 277 some of them accompany those of the Testes to the Lumbar Glands. The Anterior part of the Scrotum derives its Nerves from the Lumbar, and the posterior from the Pudenr dal and Sciatic Nerves. The Scrotum assists in supporting and protecting the Testes. Under the Scrotum are two Membranes or Coats, proper to each of the Testes, the one termed Vagina- lis, the other Albuginea. The Tunica Vaginalis, named from its forming a Sheath, is of the same nature with the Peritoneum, be- ing originally a Process of that Membrane, which, in a Foetus, descends with the Testicle from the Abdo- men. It forms a shut Sac, which has no communication with any other part. It incloses the Testicle as the Pericardium does the Heart, being only in contact with it, excepting behind, where it is continuous with the Albuginea. It is considerably larger than the Testis which it in- closes, reaches as high upon the Cord, and as much below the Testicle, as to allow the latter a certain de- gree of motion. It is connected by its external Surface to the Cre- master, and partly by that Muscle to the inner Surface of the Scrotum. It assists the Cremaster in supporting the Testis, and by being constantly moistened within by a fluid, exhaled from its Surface, and that of the Tunica Albu- ginea, it allows the Testicle to move easily. The Tunica Albuginea, so called from its white co-.

186 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. In the Passage of communication between the Au- ricle and Ventricle, there is a Ring, from which a Cir- cular Valve goes off, with all its Apparatus similar to that between the Right Auricle and Ventricle, and dif- fering in no respect from it in structure and use, ex- cept in being stronger, and divided into two principal Portions only ; and in the Chordae Tendineae being stronger and more numerous. This Valve has been supposed to bear some resem- blance to a Bishop's Mitre, from which it has been call- ed Valvula Mitralis. One of the Portions of this Valve is larger than the other, lies over the Mouth of the Aorta, and is supposed to cover it while the Blood is flowing into the Ventri- cle. The other is contiguous to the opposite side of the Ventricle. The Valvula Mitralis prevents the reflux of the Blood during the contraction of the Ventricle. After the contraction is over, the Valve returns to its former situation, by the impulse of a fresh current of Blood from the Auricle. Between the Right and Left Ventricle, there is a thick, strong, impervious Partition, which forms a share of the general Septum Cordis, having Columnae Car- neae upon it, similar to those upon the other parts of the Ventricles. It is composed partly by the Wall of the Right, but chiefly by that of the Left Ventricle ; the Right being united to the Left, almost in the form of an Appendix ; but the Fibres of the two Ventricles intermix in such a manner as to render the Septum somewhat thicker and stronger than the other parts of the Heart.

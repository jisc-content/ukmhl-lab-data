Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &e. It opens by several Orifices arranged in a line near the Gums, a little to the outside of the Frsenum of the Tongue. Sometimes this Gland sends off a Duct, which com- municates with that of the Submaxillary; but general- ly it is otherwise. In several Quadrupeds, as the Ape, Horse, and Hog, there is a distinct Duct belonging to this Gland, like that of the Submaxillary. The smaller Glands of the Mouth are in great num- bers, lying between the inner lining of the Mouth and its Muscles, and d^eriving their names from their situations. They are much inferior in size to the former, each forming a simple little Lobe, which is somewhat flat- tened, or Lenticular. Each Gland sends out a Duct, which perforates the Skin of the Mouth, and opens into its Cavity. They consist of— The Buccales, which are dispersed over the whole of the Cheek, but most plentifully near the termination of the Parotid Duct; The Molares, which are in a group, and a part of the Buccal, situated opposite to the large superior Dentes Molares; The Labiales, lying on the inside of the Lips; The Palatines, upon the Palate ; and The Linguales, vel Capitatce, at the root of the Tongue. The Arteries of the Salivary Glands are from diffe- rent Branches of the External Carotids. The Parotid Gland is supplied from the Temporal, the Inferior Maxillary Gland from the Facial, and the Sublingual Gland from the Lingual Artery, r .r • n

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 185 It is narrower and rounder, but considerably longer, both on its External Surface and in its Internal Cavity, than the Right Ventricle, and generally descends some way below the other, and forms the Apex Cordis. The Cavity is commonly described as being less than that of the Right Ventricle;—^but the apparent diffe- rence, which takes place after death, is accounted for with seeming propriety by some Authors,—from the Left Ventricle being then for the most part found empty, and the Right one full, and from the greater degree of contractility in the former. That the capacity of the Cavities of the right and left sides of the Heart is more nearly equal during life than after death, or than it is generally supposed to be, is evident from the appearance of the Heart of the Hu- man and also of the Brute kind, and from Injections thrown into the two sides of the Heart, where the force applied is in proportion to the relative strength of each side. The size of the Cavities of the Heart, varies in dif- ferent persons. In general, each is found to contain between two and three Ounces of Water, when mode- rately distended. The inner Surface of the Left Ventricle has the same general appearance with the Ventricle of the right side, but differs from it in having its Columnae Carneae lar- ger and greater in number, firmer and stronger; more detached, and more varied in their directions. They form Meshes in the shape of Lozenges, in which are Columns of a more slender nature, intercepting Meshes of an inferior size; the last of which appearing to be deeper here than in the Right Ventricle, ^

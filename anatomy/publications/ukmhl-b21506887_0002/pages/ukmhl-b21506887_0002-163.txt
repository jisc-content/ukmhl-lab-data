Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 121 The under end of it lies contiguous to the Submax- illary Gland. It is somewhat of a triangular form, but longest from above downwards ; is flattened externally, and is covered by a condensed Cellular Substance, which gives it a whitish appearance. The External Carotid Artery and corresponding Vein, are sunk deep in the Substance of the Gland ; and when it is removed, the Trunks of these Vessels, or. their divided extremities, with the posterior Belly of the Digastricus, and part of the Sterno-mastoideus, are exposed. Through the Substance of the Gland, also, the Portio Dura passes in its way to the Face. From the different Lobes of the Gland, numerous small Branches arise, which join together to form a large Duct, sometimes called Steno's Salivary Duct, or Ductus Superior^ which passes from the upper and fore part of the Gland. The Parotid Duct is of a white colour, and appears large, but, from the thickness of its Coats, the Cavity is small, in proportion to the general size of the Duct. It passes forwards and a little downwards over the Masseter, about the middle of its height, where the Muscle is Tendinous, in consequence of which it is free from compression ; and, concealed by the Fat of the Cheek, perforates obliquely the Buccinator, and Membrane of the Mouth, by an Orifice without any Papilla, opposite to the Interstice of the second and third Dens Molaris of the Upper Jaw . Near the fore part of the Masseter Muscle, there is sometimes one, at other times two, small Glands, term- ed by Haller Glandules Accessorice^ which send an

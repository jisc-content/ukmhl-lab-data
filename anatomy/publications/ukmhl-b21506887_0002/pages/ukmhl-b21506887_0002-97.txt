Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 69 softer, and weaker, than the anterior; but is quite a distinct Membrane from the Coat of the Vitreous Hu- mour, to which it is contiguous; yet so firmly con- nected to it by Cellular Substance, that it is difficult to separate them without laceration. . Some Authors describe an Aqueous Humour as seated between the Lens and its Capsule ; while others deny the existence of this Humour, as well as of that which is said to be situated between the Lamellae of the Lens. The Vessels of the Lens, or of its Capsule, are not to be seen in the Eye of an Adult; but in that of a Foetus, Petit found Vessels passing from the Corpus Ciliare over the fore part of the Capsule of the Lens. WiNSLOw afterwards observed, that in a Foetus, and in new born Children, a fine Injection succeeded so well, as to discover the Vessels of the Membranae Crystallina et Vitrea;—and in a Foetus of about six months, the injected liquor seemed to him to have penetrated a part of the Crystalline and Vitreous Humours. Albinus derives these Vessels from a double source. —In the Eye of a Whale, he demonstrated Vessels passing from the Ciliary Processes to the Substance of the Lens ; and, at a later period, he injected in the Hu- man Eye a small Branch arising from the Central Ar- tery of the Retina, which proceeded in a straight di- rection through the Vitreous Humour, and divided on the posterior part of the Capsule into Numerous Bran- ches, many Twigs of which plunged into the substance of the Lens. This Artery and its Branches, have been frequently and successfully injected by succeeding Anatomists,

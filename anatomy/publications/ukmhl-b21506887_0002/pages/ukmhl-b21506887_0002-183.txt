Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 141 rior Molares of the Under Jaw appear, and are suc- ceeded by those of the Upper Jaw. The Cuspidati come next in order, and first those of the Under Jaw, which are soon followed by those of the Upper Jaw. About the end of the second year, or a little later, the second, or posterior Molares, appear, which com- plete the first Set; though there is a great irregularity with respect to the time at which the Temporary Teeth make their appearance in the Mouth. Of the Shedding of the Temporary, and the Appearing of the Permanent Teeth. As the first Set of Teeth do not increase in breadth after they appear through the Gums, a second Set suc- ceed to them, which correspond with the larger size of the Jaw. About seven years of age is the common time at which Children begin to shed their Teeth, though some shed them a little sooner, others considerably later than this period; and it not unfrequently happens, that some of the first set remain in the Jaws to adult, or even to old age. The anterior Permanent Molares first appear; soon after this the Temporary Central Incisores of the Under Jaw are removed, and are succeeded by the Permanent Central Incisores, one coming a short time before the other; then the Central Incisores of the Upper J aw come out, and the Permanent Central Incisores suc- ceed them. Next the Lateral Incisores are succeeded by the Permanent ones.

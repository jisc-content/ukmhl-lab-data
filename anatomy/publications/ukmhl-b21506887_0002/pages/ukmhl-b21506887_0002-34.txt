COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paex IV. The Principal Sinuses are. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus, which begins at the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone, runs along the upper edge of the Falx, becomes gradually larger in its progress, and terminates in the beginning of the Lateral Sinuses, The Torcular Hekophili, or Fourth Sinus of the Ancients ;—the term Torcular applied from a supposi- tion that the Blood is squeezed in this Sinus as in a Wine-press.—It is chiefly formed of the Vena Galeni, runs in the junction of the Falx and Tentorium, and tenriinates with the former Sinus in the beginning of the Lateral Sinuses. The two Lateral Sinuses, which are formed by the Longitudinal and Torcular Sinuses. They run in de- pressions of the Occipital and Temporal Bones, first transversely, and nearly opposite the great external Arch of the Os Occipitis, then in a winding direction downwards, and terminate at the Base of the Cranium, in the beginnings of the Internal Jugular Veins. Besides the Sinuses mentioned above, several others less conspicuous will be pointed out in the particular description of the Veins. The Nerves of the Dura Mater are so very minute, that they have not' as yet been distinctly traced ; and it is found to possess very little sensibility in the sound state. Upon the sides of the Superior Longitudinal Sinus, and parts of the Brain contiguous to it, there are nume- rmis small Granulations, which are part of the Glandu-

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. m and Posterior part, each of which is originally formed of two Membranes intimately united. The Anterior part is a continuation of the Peritoneal Coats, produced from the upper and under Surfaces of the Stomach. This production arises from the whole length of the large Arch of the Stomach, and extends as far laterally as_ the beginning of the Duodenum and inner Surface of the Spleen, to both of which it is also connected. The Posterior part arises in a similar manner from the Peritoneal Coat covering the upper and under Surfaces of the Colon. The two portions thus produced from the Stomach and Colon, soon become incorporated, and form a thin production, which commonly extends, es- pecially in Fat people, a little below the Umbilicus. Sometimes, however, it does not reach so far, at other times it descends as low as the Pubes, but without ad- hering to the Walls of the Abdomen, or to the small Intestines over which it is placed. The Omentum Colicum, which is merely an Appen- dix of the Omentum, arises from the right part of the Arch of the Colon, in the same manner as the other portion of the Omentum arises from the left part of the Arch, and sends downwards and to the right side a Cuneiform Process, which is connected with the Colon Dextrum as far as the Caecum. Besides the Omentum, there is a Membrane much smaller, situated between the Liver and Stomach, term- ed Omey^um Hepato-gastricum, or Omentum Minus of WiNSLow, oii Memhrana Macilentior of Haller from its having little Fat in it. It passes from the fore part of the Sinus of the Porta,

S30 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. to the under and back part of the Liver, to be connect- ed to the whole edge of the small Curvature of the Stomach, and to the beginning of the Duodenum. It is bounded on the left side by the Cardia, on the right by the Capsule of Glisson, on the upper part by the root of the Liver, and on the lower by the small Curvature of the Stomach. Like the other Omentum, it is composed of two Lay- ers, but is thinner, less fat, and more uniform in its structure than it. After the Omentum Minus reaches the Stomach, its two Layers separate from each other, inclose that Vis- cus, and form its External Coat. At the great Curvature of the Stomach, they rejoin and form the Anterior, which soon joins the Posterior part of the Omentum Majus. The Posterior part is formed by the Peritoneal Coat of the Colon, in the same manner as the Anterior por- tion is produced from that of the Stomach. At the opposite side of the Colon, the layers re- unite, and form the Meso-colon. By the Membrane thus continued, a large irregular Sac is formed, of which the Omentum Minus, Stomach, and Anterior portion of the Omentum Majus, consti- tute the Anterior, and the Posterior part of the large Omentum, the Colon, and Meso-colon, the Posterior part of this Sac. In Young Subjects, the sides of this Sac are so com- plete, that it may be inflated from what is called the Foramen of Winslow ; but in old emaciated people, the Layers of which it is composed become Cribriform or Reticular in consequence of Absorption.

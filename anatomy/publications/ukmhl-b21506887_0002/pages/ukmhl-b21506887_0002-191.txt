Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 149 immediately under the Os Hyoides, which is placed at the root of the Tongue. In a Male, the Larynx is proportionally larger, and is also more prominent, than in a Female; before Pu- berty, however, and in cases of early castration, the size of the Larynx in a Male is more nearly similar to that in a Female. It is broader above than below, composed of Carti- lages, Muscles, Ligaments, Membranes, and Mucous Glands. It is connected above to the Tongue and Os Hyoides ; and behind to the Pharynx. The Cartilages of the Laryn?: are generally consider- ed as being five in number, though, besides these, some choose to enumerate small Projections which are con- nected with them. The Five Cartilages are,â€”the Thyroid, the Cricoid, the Tivo Arytenoid, and the Epiglottis. The Thyroid, Scutiform, or Shield-lilte Cartilage, is placed at the upper lateral and fore part of the Larynx, and is the largest of the whole. The lateral portions of this Cartilage are somewhat compressed where they are covered by the Thyro-hyoid Muscles. When spread out, it is of an oblong shape ; but in the natural situation, it consists of two lateral Wings or Portions, of a quadrangular form, uniting before in a longitudinal Angle, which can be readily felt in the fore part of the Throat, and which, from its being larger, and projecting more in Men than in Women, has obtained the name of Pomum Adami. The upper part of the Angle is formed into a Notch, from which, and from the upper edge of the Cartilage

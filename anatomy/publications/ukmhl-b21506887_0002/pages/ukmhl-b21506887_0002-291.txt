Ml It is thicJc on its right and posterior part, and be- comes gradually thinner towards the left side; is obtuse or bhmt posteriorly, where it is opposed to the Lumbar Vertebras, and acute or sharp on its anterior edge, where it follows the Margin of the Right False Ribs.—It is considerably broader from one side to the other, than from before backwards. It is divided into Prominences or Lobes, two of which, called Great and Small, or Right and Left Lobes, are so considerable as to form the Body and whole upper part of the Liver :—The other Lobes, which are very inferior in size, are placed upon the under side of the Great one.^ The Great Lobe is situated obliquely in the Right Hypochondriac Region, following the Curve of the Diaphragm, and rests upon the Pylorus, Colon, and top of the Right Kidney. The Small Lobe, which is diminutive in size when compared with the Great one, is distinguished from the latter by a broad Ligament, and is placed almost horizontally, chiefly in the Epigastric, only a small portion of it lying in the left Hypochondriac Region. The other Lobes are, The Lobulus Spigelii, which is small when compar- ed with the two former Lobes, but is the principal one below. It is situated near the Spine, upon the left side of the Great Lobe, and is of a pyramidal form, project- ing like a Nipple, between the Cardia and Vena Cava, at the Small Curvature of the Stomach, The Lobulus Caudatus, which is merely the Root, or one of the Angles of the Lobulus Spigelii, advancing VOL.

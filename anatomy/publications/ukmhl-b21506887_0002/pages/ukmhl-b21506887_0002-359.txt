Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. ^ more convoluted, and at last, expanding its convolu- tions, it comes out greatly increased in size, and almost in a straight direction, under the name of Vas Deferens. Besides the Ducts already described, a Vas Aherrans is sometimes observed, which is one of the Vascular Cones, vrandering off, and terminating in the E^pididy- mis lower than usual. At other times, the same kind of Vessel passes a con- siderable way along the Spermatic Cord, and forms a Processus Ccecus^ or Blind Duct, with a dilated Extre- mity, which does not communicate with any other part. The Vas Deferens is about the size of a Surgeon's Probe, and is of a cylindrical form through the greater part of its length. It has no inflections in its course, but such as are necessary for its arrival at the place of its destination. It ascends in the back part of the Spermatic Cord, having the Spermatic Blood-vessels on its fore part, but from which it is readily distinguished by its firmness. At the under part of the Abdomen, it passes in through the Ring of the External Oblique Muscle, and at the Internal Abdominal Ring separates from the Blood-vessels, goes over the Psoas, and descends by the side of the Pelvis, covered by the Peritoneum. " In its descent in the Pelvis, it gets behind the Blad^ der, to which it closely adheres, follows the Curvature of that Viscus, gradually approaching its fellow till it arrives at the Vesicula Seminalis of the same side. In this course it passes between the corresponding Umbilical Artery and Bladder, and also between the Bladder and Ureter, where it increases considerably in size, and becomes Cellular within. It continues under

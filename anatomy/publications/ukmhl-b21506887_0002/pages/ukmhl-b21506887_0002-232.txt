182 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. stronger resistance against the Blood, while the Ar- tery is in action. The Semilunar Valves, when shut, are concave to- wards the Artery, convex towards the Ventricle, and have their loose edges opposed to each other, so as to enable them to form a complete Partition between the Ventricle and Artery. Opposite to the Semilunar Valve, the Artery bulges out, and forms Three Projections, which have corre- sponding Pits or Depressions within, and are called, from their Discoverer, Sinus Valsalvae. The Sinuses of Valsalva are of the same nature with those Dilatations which are found in the Veins and Lymphatics, between their sides and Valves; and, like them, are partly formed by the pressure of the Fluids upon the sides of the Vessels. The Pulmonary Artery receives the Blood from the Right Ventricle, and, by its contractile power, assists the Ventricle in driving it through the Lungs. The Semilunar Valves, pressed back by the Blood in the Artery, prevent its return into the Ventricle. The Valves are opened again in consequence of their being driven towards the sides of the Artery by the current of the Blood, upon the next contraction or stroke of the Ventricle. The Pulmonary Artery passes behind the Sternum, and separates into Right and Left Branches^ which go to the corresponding parts of the Lungs. The two Branches of the Pulmonary Artery, like those of the Arteries of the Viscera in other parts of the large Cavities, suddenly divide into still smaller Branches.

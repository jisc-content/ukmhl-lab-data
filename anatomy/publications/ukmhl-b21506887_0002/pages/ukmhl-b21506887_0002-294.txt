COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. or posterior part of the Liver to the Tendinous portion of the Diaphragm. The Ligamentum Dextrum^ or Right Lateral Liga- ment^ which is short, and connects the back part of the right extremity of the Great Lobe to the Diaphragm. The Ligamentum Sinistrum, or Left Lateral Liga- ment^ which is longer than the former, and connects the left extremity of the Small Lobe to the Diaphragm. The two Lateral Ligaments are merely the exten- sions of the Coronary Ligament- Besides the Ligaments already mentioned, two others are described by Haller ; one called Hepato-colicum, which passes from the Gall-Bladder and contiguous Sinus Portarum, across the Duodenum, to the Colon ; —another termed Hepato-renale^ which descends from the root of the Liver to the Kidney.—These, as well as the other Ligaments of the Liver in general, are productions of the Peritoneum. The Ligaments of the Liver preserve it in its proper situation, and of course prevent it from inclining too much in any direction, at the same time allowing it to change place in a small degree, according to the differ- ent states of Respiration, and to the change of situa- tion of the other Viscera near it.—The Stomach and Intestines support it when in the^erect posture, and the Diaphragm when the Body is in the inverted position. The Liver has a simple Coat adhering closely to it, which it derives from the Peritoneum, giving it a shining appearance externally. It is every where cover- ed by this Membrane, excepting behind, where it ad- heres to the Diaphragm by the Cellular Texture of the Ligamentum Coronarium.

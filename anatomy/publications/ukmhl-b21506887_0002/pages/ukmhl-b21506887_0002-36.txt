U COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Over the Convolutions this Membrane is remarkably thin and dense ; in the Furrows between them it is thicker and looser in its texture, becoming gradually thinner towards the bottom of these. It serves to contain and support the Vessels of the Brain, and allows them to divide into such minute parts, as to prevent the Blood from entering the tender Sub- stance of this Viscus with too great force. The Arteries of the Pia Mater are the same with those of the Brain, to be afterwards taken notice of. The Veins differ in no respect from those in other parts of the Body, excepting that they are a little more tender, and that they do not in general closely accom- pany the Arteries. Cerebrum. lihe*Cerebrum, or Brain properly so called, is situ- ated in the upper part of the Cranium, which, with the membranes, it completely occupies, and is formed of parts which have a general similarity to each other in the opposite sides of the Head. It-is divided into two halves, termed Hemispheres, which are separated by a deep fissure in which the Falx is situated. Each of the Hemispheres is of an oval form, or they somewhat resemble an Egg cut longitudinally into two equal parts. The inner sides are flat, and closely ap- plied to the Falx, the upper and outer parts convex, and the under Surface irregular. The under Surface is divided into two Anterior, tzvo Lateral, and two Posterior Lobes, or Processes.

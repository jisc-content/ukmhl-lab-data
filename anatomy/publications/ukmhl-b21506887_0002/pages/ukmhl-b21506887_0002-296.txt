COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. of the Vena Portae, are inclosed in a large portion of Cellular Substance, which is also frequently called Capsule o/'Glisson, from that Author supposing it to be a continuation of the Caspule which covers the Vessels before they enter the Liver. The Hepatic Artery is derived from the C celiac, and is dispersed throughout the whole Substance of the Liver, and also upon the Coat which covers it, and is so small, when compared with the Bulk of the Liver, as to have been generally thought to be destined for the nourishment merely of that Viscus; but, from In- jections passing from the Artery to the Biliary Ducts, and from other causes, it has been supposed by some Anatomists, that the Hepatic Artery is not only intends ed to nourish the Liver, but is capable of secreting part of the Bile ;—and this supposition is farther con- firmed, from the Vena Portae having, in a recent case, been found wanting, while at the same time the Hepa- tic Artery was larger than usual, and the Veins, which commonly fojm the Vena Portas, terminated in the Vena Cava. The Vena Portce is named from its situation with respect to the Porta of the Liver. It partakes of the nature of an Artery and a Vein ; —Like the former, it carries the Blood from the Trunk to the Branches, and, like the latter, it carries it to the Heart;—or it is peculiar in the Blood flow- ing in one part as in a Vein from the Branches to the Trunk, and in another, as in an Artery from the Trunk to the Branches, and performing a Secretion. It is formed by the Veins of the Stomach and Intes- tines, joined to those of the Spleen, Omentum, and Pan-f

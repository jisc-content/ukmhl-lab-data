Paiit IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. U5 parts of the Body, others are proper to itself; all of which have been already described. The Arteries of the Larynx are the two Superior Laryngeals, which come from the External Carotids, and the two Inferior Laryngeals, which are sent off from the Subclavian Arteries. The Superior Laryngeal Veins return to the Inter- nal Jugulars ; the Inferior to the Subclavians, or Su- perior Cava. The Nerves are chiefly the Superior and Inferior Laryngeals, which are Branches of the Eighth Pair. The Larynx is subservient to Respiration, it forms and modulates the Voice, and is also useful in Deglu^ tition. It is the principal Organ of Voice for, if a Hole be cut in the Trachea, of sufficient size to allow the Person to breathe freely through it, the power of pro- ducing voice is destroyed till the cut is closed. Voice is formed by the Air, in its passage through the Glottis, acting upon the Ligaments of the Glottis and Cartilages of the Larynx and Trachea, and thus producing a Tremor ; and is difi^erent in different Per- sons, according to the form and structure of the La- rynx. The strength of Voice is in proportion to that of the Larynx, to the quantity of Air expired, and the nar- rowness of the Glottis. A Tone is acute in proportion to the small size of the Larynx, to the tension of the parts of the Larynx and Trachea in general, of the Ligaments of the Glot- tis in particular, and to the contracted state of the Rima Glottidis; all of which circumstances are pro-^

10 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt IV. APPENDAGES of the SKIN. Nails. The Nails were formerly regarded as a production of the Papillae of the Cutis, but are now more gene- rally considered as a continuation of the Cuticle. They are removed along with it by boiling water, or by maceration. Like the Cuticle, they are insensible, excepting where they adhere to the Cutis, are renewable after having been separated, and have no evident Vessels. They differ from it, however, in structure; being formed of Plates^ and the Plates of Longitudinal Fibres, which are closely compacted, as may be seer^ when they are thoroughly dried, or in a diseased state. They begin by a transverse edge, a little before the last Joint of the Fingers and Toes. When separated from the Skin, they are transparent like Horn, but are coloured in the living Body by the Vessels of the Cutis, to which they adhere, and from which they derive their nourishment. They are fixed at their roots to a Semilunar Fold of the Cutis, and are there covered by a reflection of the Cuticle, which firmly adheres to them. They grow from the roots, and not from the points ; and begin to be formed about the third month after Conception. The Nails strengthen and defend the ends of the Fingers and Toes, and thereby serve as Buttresses.

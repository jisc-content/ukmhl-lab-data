Pa^it IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 245 The Liver is composed of several kinds of Vessels, the extreme Branches of which are intermixed in such a manner, as to form numerous Pulpy Corpuscles, named Acini, from their supposed resemblance to the stones of a Grape, but which are only about the size of Mustard Seeds. These, when minutely examined, are observed to be composed of Vessels in the form of radiated Villi or Penicilli. The Vessels of the Liver are, the Hepatic Artery, Vena Portarum, Vence Hepaticce, Ahsorhents, and Bill- ary Ducts.—It has likewise numerous Nerves. The Trunks of the Hepatic Artery, Vena Portse, Biliary Ducts and Nerves, with the Absorbents and Lymphatic Glands, form a large Cord at the under side of the Liver. The Artery is situated in the left part of the Cord, the Vein in the right, with the common Trunk of the Biliary Ducts before it;—The Nerves, Lymphatic Vessels, and Glands, surrounding the Trunks of the Blood and Biliary Vessels. The Cord of Vessels and Nerves is intermixed" with much Cellular Substance, and covered externally by a Reflection of the Peritoneum, continued from the Omentum Minus, which has obtained the name of Capsule o/*Glisson. The Branches of the Vessels and Nerves accompany each other through the Substance of the Liver, form- ing small Fasciculi, in a manner somewhat similar to the Fasciculus of which the Cord is formed by their Trunks. In their course through the Liver, the Branches of the different Vessels and Nerves, but particularly those

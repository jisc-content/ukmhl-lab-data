90 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. upwards,-for lodging the Base of the Bone called Stapes. The long diameter of this Fenestra is placed transverse- ly, and is nearly double the length of the short one. The inner edges of this Hole are contracted by a nar- row Border, upon which the end of the Stapes rests. Below the Fenestra Ovalis, and at the under and back part of the Promontory, a Hole, smaller than the former, called Fenestra. Rotunda. It is placed obliquely backwards and outwards, and leads to the Cochlea, but is shut in the Subject by a thin Substance, termed J/mSmwa Tympani Secundaria, stretched across the inner side of it, which assists in communicating Sound to the Labyrinth. The two Fo- ramina are placed opposite to the Membrana Tympani. The Sides or Walls of the Tympanum, which like- wise assist in conveying Sound to the Labyrinth, are lined with Periosteum, which is reflected into the diffe- rent Passages leading from it. The Cavity of the Tympanum contains air, and four small Bones called Ossicula Auditus, which form a Chain, stretching irregularly from the Membrana Tympani to the Labyrinth. The Ossicula Auditus are,—the Malleus, the Incus, the Os Orhiculare, and the Stapes,—these names being derived from Substances which the Ossicula are sup- posed to resemble in shape. The Malleus, or Hammer, consists of a round Head, a small Neck, a Manubrium or Handle, and two small Processes; one in the Neck, long and very slender, and therefore called Gracilis; the other in the upper end of the Handle, called Processus Brevis. The Handle is by some Authors considered as one of

The Hairs are placed obliquely, with their roots to- wards the Nose, and the Arches elevated a little above the rest of the Fore-head, by a considerable quantity of Cellular Substance lying under the Skin. They are moved in different directions by the action of the Occipito-frontalis, Corrugator Supercilii, and Orbicularis Palpebrarum. They are intended partly for Ornament, and partly as Shades over the Eyes, thereby preventing them from being injured by extraneous matter, or by too great a degree of light.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. m From the Bulb, the Corpus Spongiosum is continued along the under part of the Corpora Cavernosa, of a Cylindrical figure, and at the end of these expands into the Glans Penis, which is of an oval form, and placed obliquely. The Glans covers and incloses the ends of the Corpora Cavernosa. The Glans is separated from the Corpora Cavernosa by a continuation of the Ligamentous Sheath which covers them, and is encircled at its posterior part by a prominent Margin, called Corona Glandis; behind which is a Cervix. The Surface of the Glands is covered by a Plexus chiefly of Venous Vessels, and with ISfervous Papillce ; and these are inclosed in the Skin continued from the inside of the Prepuce, but now become so delicate, that the colour of the Corpus Spongiosum of the Gland ap- pears through it. The Nervous Papillae render the Glans the principal seat of the sensibility of which the Penis is susceptible. About the Cervix and Corona of the Glans are many Follicles, termed Glandulce Odoriferce, which discharge a Sebaceous Matter, to preserve the sensibility of the Glans, and allow the Prepuce to move backwards and forwards upon it with facility. The Internal Structure of the Bulb of the Urethra and Glans Penis, is of the same nature with that of the Corpora Cavernosa ; and the Internal Structure of the rest of the Corpus Spongiosum diiFers from that of the Corpora Cavernosa only in this, that the Cells are small- er, and of a more delicate Texture. Some Anatomists consider the greater part of the Corpus Spongiosum as T 2

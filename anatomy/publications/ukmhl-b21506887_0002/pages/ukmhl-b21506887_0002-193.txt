Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 151 thie wings of the Thyroid Cartilage, and has its anterior narrow part fixed to the under edge of that Cartilage. It has four small Articular Surfaces, with distinct Capsular Ligaments, of which two are placed above, for -the articulation of the Arytenoid Cartilages, and two at the under and lateral parts, for the connexion of the in- ferior Cornua of the Thyroid Cartilage. The Cricoid Cartilage forms part of the general Tube of the Trachea, constitutes the Base of the La- rynx, and gives a firm support to the Arytenoid Car- tilages. The two Arytenoid Cartilages are much smaller than the others, and are placed upon the superior, poste- rior, and lateral parts of the Cricoid Cartilage, at a small distance from each other. They are of a triangular form and a little twisted ; and are bent back above, so as to have a broad concave Surface behind, which is occupied by the Arytenoid Muscles. The anterior Surface of these Cartilages is convex, but upon each convexity there is a small Depression, which is also occupied by Glands. Their upper Extremities, or Cornua, are turned to- wards each other, and are now and then found loose in the form of Appendices, which are considered by some Authors as distinct Cartilages, and termed Cuneiform or Tuherculated, The Bases are broad and hollow^ where they are ar- ticulated by Capsular Ligaments with the Cricoid Car- tilage, upon which they are moved in diiferent direc- tions, by the action of various Muscles.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. m Muscular Fibres are collected upon it into three Fasci- culi, which, with the Peritoneum covering them, form so many Ligamento-muscular Bands, that arise at the root of the Vermiform Process, and are continued along the Colon till they arrive at the Rectum, where they are first united into two parts, and then spread out in- to a uniform Coat. The Longitudinal Bands are shorter than the rest of the Colon, and of course assist in diminishing its length, and forming it into Plicae, which lie across the Gut, answering to the Valvulae Conniventes; only they are at a greater distance from each other, and much larger ; dividing the Intestines into little apartments, or Pouches, called Cells of the Colon. The Cells of the Colon, with their Partitions, have a threefold order, the Intestine being almost quite smooth or plain, opposite to the Longitudinal Bands. The Cells assist in preventing the too rapid descent" of the Fasces. The Colon receives the Excrementitious parts of the Aliment, retains them, till they are changed into Faeces, and then, by the Peristaltic motion of the Intestines and power of Respiration, pushes them, by slow de- grees, to the Rectum. The Rectum differs from the Colon in being covered only anteriorly and laterally by the Peritoneum :â€”Its Muscular Fibres are stronger and thicker, and spread uniformly over the Intestine. The Circular Fibres are so considerable at the end of the Rectum, as to have been named Internal Sphincter- of the Anus. The Rectum has no Cells like the Colon; but the Cel- lular and inner Coats are so much larger here than they

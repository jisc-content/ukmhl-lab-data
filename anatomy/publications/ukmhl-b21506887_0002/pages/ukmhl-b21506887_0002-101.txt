Part IV.] OP THE VISCERA, &c. 7S spective names from their size, situation, direction, or use. Of the Straight Muscles, one is situated above the Eye, another below it, and one on each side. Of the Oblique, one is placed in the upper and inner, and the other at the under and outer part of the Eye. The Recti are not straight, as the name implies; for, on account of the form of the Eye, all, except the in- ternal, or that next the Nose, have somewhat of a curv- ed direction. Neither are they all equally long, the internal being the shortest, the external the longest, corresponding with the shape of the Eye and Orbit. The other two are nearly of the same length with each other. The four Straight Muscles, which bear a strong re- semblance to one another, arise by a narrow beginning a little Tendinous and Fleshy, from the edge of the Foramen Opticum, where they embrace the Optic Nerve at its entrance in the Orbit. In their passage forwards, they form Fleshy Bellies, which send off broad and very thin Tendons, to be in- serted into the Sclerotic Coat, under the Tunica Ad- nata, about a quarter of an inch behind the edge of the Cornea, and at equal distances from each other. At the place of their Insertion, they are so intimate- ly connected with the Sclerotica, that they cannot be separated from it, or their Insertion be brought as far as the Cornea, without evident laceration. Of the Oblique Muscles, one arises along with the Recti, the other comes from the fore part of the Or- bit, and both are fixed to the back part of the Sclero- tica.

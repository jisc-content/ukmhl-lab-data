Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 169 Mediastinum by Branches from the Intercostals and Esophageals. The Veins accompany the Arteries, and have the same names. The Mediastinum divides the Thorax into two Cavi- ties, supports its general Contents, keeps one Lung from pressing upon the other when a Person lies on his side, and prevents Fluids, which, in consequence of accidents or disease, may be contained in the Cavi-. ty of the Thorax, from passing from one side to the other.

The Internal Layer is smooth, tendinous-like, and has Fibres running in different directions, something like those of the Dura Mater.

44 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. into two systems, and attempt to trace them through the various parts of the Brain, under the names of Diverging and Converging Apparatus of Fibres: thus considering the Medulla Oblongata as giving origin to the Brain, instead of the Brain being the source of the Medulla Oblongata, and other parts of the Nervous System in general. Upon this subject consult Dr Gordon's Observations on the Structure of the Brain. The Arteries of the Brain are derived from the In- ternal Carotids and Vertebrals, and run in a tortuous manner through the Base of the Cranium, to prevent the Blood from rushing too violently into the Brain. The Veins, as formerly mentioned, only differ from those of other Viscera in being more tender, and in not following the course of their respective Arteries. The Brain is the Grand and Primary Organ of Sense, with which the Mind is supposed to he most im- mediately and intimately connected^ and from which the Nervous Injiuence is Jhund^ hy experiment, to he com- municated to all the other parts of the Body. Origin qf the Nerves. The Nerves arise from, or are connected with, the Medullary parts of the Brain, some in solid Cords, others in separate Threads, which afterwards unite in- to Cords, and have their names in numerical succession, according to their situations,â€”beginning anteriorly. Nine or ten Pairs are connected with the Brain, be- sides a Pair termed Sympathetic.

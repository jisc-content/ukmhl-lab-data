S04 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IY. outer extremities. They have a very large proportion of Blood-vessels which run between their outer and inner Membranes. The Tubes are supposed to convey the prolific part of the Male Semen from the Uterus to the Ovaria, in order to fecundate the Ova; and by grasping that part of the Ovarium where the ripest Ovum is situated, to carry the Ovum according to some authors, or its con- tents only according to the opinion of others, to be mixed with the Male Semen, and to be lodged in the Cavity of the Uterus. One of the Tubes has been observed, in a few in- stances, in Females who have been killed soon after Coition, embracing the Ovarium by means of its Fim- briae. The Vagina is a Membranous Canal, which extends from the neck of the Uterus to the Opening of the Pudendum. It is situated below the Urethra, and at the under and back part of the Bladder, and over the under part of the Intestinum Rectum ; to each of which it is very closely connected by Cellular Substance. It begins a little above the internal Orifice of the Uterus, which it embraces, but reaches higher at the posterior than anterior part of that Opening; from which circumstance, together with a slight Curvature it has backwards, the Canal is found to be longer in its posterior than anterior Surface. From the Os Tincse it passes downwards and for- wards, and terminates between the Labia Pudendi; the Axis of the Vagina forming a considerable Angle with that of the Uterus.

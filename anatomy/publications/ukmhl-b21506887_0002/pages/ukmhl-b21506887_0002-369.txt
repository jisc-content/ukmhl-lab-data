Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, kc. 293 —including nearly the space of an inch,—the Urinary Passage is entirely Membranous, and destitute of Spongy Substance, but it is surrounded by a strong Ligamen- tous Membrane, which is stretched between the Crura of the Ossa Pubis, and forms the Interosseous Liga- ment, or the Triangular Ligament of former Authors. Where the Urethra perforates this Ligament, it is more contracted than it is farther forwards, when it en- ters the Bulb, and this is the part where the princi- pal resistance is found in the introduction of a Sound or a Catheter. At the upper side of the Bulb, the Urethra enters the Corpus Spongiosum, in which it is inclosed to its termi- nation in the point of the Penis. The inside of the Urethra is lined by a very Vascular and sensible Membrane, continued from the inner Coat of the Bladder, but which is observed to possess a certain degree of contractility, and is therefore pre- sumed by several Anatomists to be endowed with Mus- cular Fibres. Between the Corpus Spongiosum and Membrane which lines the Urethra, especially towards the Septum Penis, numerous Lacunce of different sizes are situat- ed, one or two of which in particular, next the Glans, are often considerably larger than the rest. They run in a longitudinal direction from behind for- wards, and, perforating the Urethra by Orifices large enough to admit a Bristle, they discharge a bland Mu- cus for the defence of the Urethra. Besides the Lacunae, two small Bodies of a yellowish colour, each about the size of a Garden-pea, are fre- quently met with, and are termed, from their Discoverer,

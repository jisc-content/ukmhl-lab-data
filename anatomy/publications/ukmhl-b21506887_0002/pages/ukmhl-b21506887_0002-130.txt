96 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Gyri go round a Nucleus, Axis, or Central Pil- lar, which is nearly horizontal, and is formed of two hollow Cones, with their points turned to each other, the one termed Modiolus, from its resemblance to the Spindle of a winding Stair-case, the other Infwndibu- lum, or Funnel. The Modiolus forms the inner and larger portion of the central Pillar, and is that Cavity seen in the bot- tom or outer extremity of the Meatus Auditorius In- ternus. It lodges the Branch of the Portio Mollis of the Se- venth Pair of Nerves, which goes to the Cochlea, and is Cribriform, or full of small Holes, for the passage of the Twigs of that Branch. The Modiolus consists of two Plates, with numerous Cells and Passages between them, and terminates in the middle of the second Gyrus of the Cochlea. The Infundibuium is an imperfect Funnel, the Apex of which is common with that of the Modiolus, and the Base is covered by the Apex of the Cochlea, which is termed Cupola. Between the Scalas of the Cochlea there is a Parti- tion, called Lamina Spiralis, or Septum Scalce; the larger portion of which, next the Modiolus, is formed of Bone; the remainder, or that part next the opposite side of the Scalas, is composed of a Cartilaginous Mem- brane, and termed by Valsalva Zona CochlecB.â€”This drops out by maceration, so as afterwards to leave only a partial Septum. The Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis is composed of two extremely thin Cribriform Plates, which gradually

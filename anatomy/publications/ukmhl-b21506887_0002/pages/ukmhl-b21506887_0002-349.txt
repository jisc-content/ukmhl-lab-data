Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. ^TS VOL. II. ' s when the Bladder is empty, it forms large Wrinkles or Rugae. The inside of the Bladder is very irritable, in conse- quence of which the desire to expel the Urine is excit- ed. It is lined, however, by a Mucus discharged from its Arteries, which prevents it from being constantly irritated by that Fluid. The under part of the Bladder is perforated by three Openings ; of which one is placed anteriorly, and two posteriorly. The anterior Opening is the beginning of the Passage called Urethra^ and is surrounded by the Neck of the Bladder. It comes off almost at a right Angle from the Blad- der, about an inch or so above the undermost part, without any tapering of that Viscus. The inner lining of the Urethra at the posterior part of the Neck of the Bladder is frequently formed, in old people, into longitudinal Folds. These, in the dis- eased state of the Prostate Gland, assist in the for- mation of the Lobes, which often project so much into the Cavity of the Bladder, as to have the effect of a Valve in closing up the Orifice of the Urethra. The other two Openings of the Bladder are formed by the terminations of the Ureters, which run obliquely forwards and inwards, between the Muscular and Inner Coats of the Bladder. They terminate in the Bladder at a little distance from each other, and at the same distance behind the beginning of the Urethra, each by a somewhat oval opening, which is more contracted than the Ureter is immediately above it.

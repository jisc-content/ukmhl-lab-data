1^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. equal number of Tubes into the Parotid Duct t but these are very inconstant. In the vicinity of the Parotid, some Lymphatic Glands are situated, two of which, more constant than the rest, are placed at its upper and under extremities, which are frequently swelled in scrofulous cases. The Suhmaocillari/ Gland is smaller and rounder than the Parotid, and is situated on the inside of the Angle of the Lower Jaw, between it and the Tendon of the Digastricus, and directly under the Platysma Myoides. From the upper and fore part of this Gland, a Duct arises, called by some Authors Ductus Whartoni, vel Ductus Inferior^ which is much thinner in its Coats than the former Duct, but longer. It passes forwards between the Mylo-hyoideus and Genio-glossus, along the under and inner edge of the Sublingual Gland, and perforates the Membrane of the Mouth at the side of the Fraenum Linguae, behind the Dentes Incisores, by a small Orifice in form of a Papilla. The Sublingual Gland is smaller, longer, and softer, than the Submaxillary, and is flat, and of an oval form. It is situated under the anterior and lateral portion of the Tongue, its upper edge projecting into the Cavity of the Mouth. It is placed above the Duct of the Infe- rior Maxillary Gland, and under the Gustatory Nerve, near the Lower Jaw, between the Mylo-hyoideus and Genio-hyo-glossus ; the former of which sustains it. Its extremities are turned forwards and backwards^ and the edges obliquely inwards and outwards. It is covered by a continuation of the Skin of the under side of the Tongue, which fixes it in its place.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 215 phagus,—by the Pylorus to the beginning of the Intes- tines,—by the Peritoneum and Blood-vessels to the Spleen,—and by a reflection of the Peritoneum Jo the root of the Liver, and to the part of the great Intes- tines termed Arch of the Colon. The Structure of the Stomach is in general similar to that of the Esophagus, of which it is a kind of expansion. The Coats of the Stomach are Four in number. The First, or External Coat) called also Peritoneal, is a reflection of that part of the Peritoneum which comes from the root of the Liver. It is remarkably thin, but dense and somewhat elas- tic. It strengthens the Stomach, prevents it from be- ing over distended, and, by its smoothness, being con- stantly lubricated by a liquor discharged from the ex- halents of the Peritoneum in general, diminishes the eff'ects of Friction; and, possessing few Nerves or Blood-vessels, it is not very susceptible of pain or in» flammation. The Cellular Substance under the Peritoneal Cover- ing is described by some Authors as a distinct Coat, called Tunica Cellulosa RuyscJiiana ;—but ought not to be numbered among the Coats of the Stomach. The Second, or Muscular Coat, is composed chiefly of two Planes of Fibres variously disposed. The External Plane is longitudinal. It extends from the longitudinal Fibres of the Esophagus, and follows the same general course with that of the Sto- mach from the Great to the Small Extremity. Upon each side of the small Curvature, the External Plane forms a thick strong Band of Muscular Fibres, which strengthen the parts to which they belong.

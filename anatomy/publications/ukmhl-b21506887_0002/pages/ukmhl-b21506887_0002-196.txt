154 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. In the Interstice of the Superior and Inferior Liga- ments, on each side there is a Fissure, which leads to a small Membranous Cavity or Depression, about the size of the point of the little Finger, which has its bottom turned outwards. These are the Ventricles of the Larynx, named after Galen.â€”They are chiefly formed by the inner Mem- brane of the Larynx. ^ They differ in size in different people, have Mucous Follicles opening into them, and are found to be ser- viceable in the modulation of the Voice. On the anterior Surface of each of the Arytenoid Cartilages, there is a small Depression, filled by a Glandular Body, which not only covers the fore part of the Cartilage, but is continued over the posterior extremities of the Ligaments af the Glottis. The Arytenoid Glands are larger in some Subjects than in others. They were discovered, and are parti- cularly described and delineated, by Morgagni. The Ligaments which connect the Epiglottis to the Notch of the Thyroid Cartilage, and to the under side of the Os Hyoides, together with one which ties the Base of the Os Hyoides, form a Triangular Space, in which are found a quantity of Cellular Substance and Mucous Glands. The Cavity of the Larynx is lined by a Membrane, which is extremely irritable, and is every where perfo- rated by the Mouths of small Mucous Glands, for the purpose of moistening it. The Larynx has a number of Muscles, for its diffe- rent motions, some of which are common to it and other

86 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PartIV. The Veins pass partly to the External, and partly to the Internal Jugulars. The Nerves which supply the fore part of the Ear, are derived from the third part of the Fifth, and from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pairs. Those which supply the under and back part come from the first and second Cervicals. The Meatus Externus conveys sound from the outer towards the inner Ear, and is supposed to do this to greater advantage on account of the winding nature of the Passage. In a Foetus, the Meatus is entirely Cartilaginous, and only adheres to an imperfect Bony Circle, in which the Membrana Tympani is fixed. At the inner end of the Meatus Externus, the Mem- brana Tympani is situated, which is thin but firm, some- what dry and elastic, almost transparent, and of an oval form; the longest diameter of the oval being about four tenths of an inch in length. It is fixed in a Groove which divides the Meatus from the Tympanum. It is very tense, but has a small Depression in the middle, next the Meatus, with a corresponding Con- vexity towards the Tympanum, where the extremity of the Bone called Malleus is fixed. Its situation is somewhat oblique, the upper part be- ing turned outwards, and the under inwards, so that the lower side of the Meatus is a little longer than the upper. It forms a complete impervious Septum^ though the contrary has been maintained by some Authors.

310 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Labia are thickest above, becoming thinner be- low, and terminate in a transverse Fold of the Skin, called Frcenum, Furcula, or Fourchette^ which is fre- quently lacerated in the first Delivery. The Labia are composed of the Skin elevated by a large quantity t)f Cellular Substance and some Fat, and lined by a very Vascular Membrane, which is thin, tender, and red, like the inside of the lips. They are also furnished with numberless Sebaceous Follicles, se- creting a Liquor by which the parts are preserved smooth and moist. Between the upper ends of the Labia, is the Sub- stance termed Clitoris^ and by some Mentula Muliehris, â€”not exceeding an inch in length, and little more than the third part of that in thickness. It is tied down to the fore part of the Symphysis Pubis, and in its ordi- nary state, is in a manner buried under the Skin. It is extremely Vascular and Nervous, and is com- posed, like the Penis in a Male, of two Crura and Corpora Cavernosa, which are occasionally distended with Blood. They are contained in a Ligamentous Sheath, and have a Septum between them. The Crura are upwards of twice the length of the Body of the Clitoris, and, together with Muscles be- longing to them, arise, as the Crura of the Penis do in a Male, from the Crura of the Ossa Ischia and Ossa Pubis. The Clitoris is also provided with a Ligamentum Suspensorium, by which it is connected to the Ossa Pubis, and with a Glans, which, like that of the Penis, is extremely sensible, but has no perforation in it for the passage of Urine.

100 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, by their union, assist in forming the Membranous Por- tion of the Lamina Spiralis, which, together with the Osseous part, completes the Septum between the two Scalae. The Periosteum of the Cochlea also assists that of the Tympanum in forming the Membrane of the Fenes- tra Rotunda, which is sometimes called Membrana Tym- pant Secundaria^ from a resemblance to the Membrana Tympani, and from being also, like it, a little concave on the outer, and convex on the inner Surface, or where it faces the Scalae to which it belongs. Besides the Periosteum, the Vestibule, Cochlea, and Semicircular Canals, contain a Pulpy Membrane, or there is a Membranous Labyrinth, upon which the Portio Mollis is regularly dispersed. In the Vestibule, the Pulpy Membrane forms a Sac, called Sacculus Vestihuli^ in shape resembling that of the Osseous Cavity which contains it, and which is de- scribed and beautifully delineated by Scarpa. When the Sac is laid open upon the upper and outer part, a Partition appears, partaking of the nature of the Sac, and termed by Dr Meckel, Septum Vestibuli Nervoso-Membranaceum, In the Cochlea, the Pulpy Membrane is in contact with the Periosteum, but can be separated from that Membrane without much difficulty. In the Semicircular Canals, it is at some distance from the Periosteum of these Bones, and is considerably smaller; and forms distinct Tubes, which communicate with the Sacculus Vestibuli, Like the Osseous, each of the Membranous Canals also forms an Ampulla or Elliptic Cavity, at one end.

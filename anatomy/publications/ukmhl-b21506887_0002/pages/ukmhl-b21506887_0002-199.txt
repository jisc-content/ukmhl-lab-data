Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 157 The Lobes are joined by an intermediate portion^ called Isthmus^ which lies across the upper and fore part of the Trachea. Sometimes a Process from the middle Portion, which may be mistaken for what Haller calls Levator Glan^ dulcE Thyroidece, and Soemmerring, Musculus Glan^ dulcB ThyroidecB, ascends between the Sterno-hyoidei, and is fixed to the Os Hyoides. This Gland has a granulous appearance within, and a Viscid Liquor is sometimes observed in it, which has been supposed by Sabatier, and some others, to lu- bricate the parts in the neighbourhood. It is supplied with large Blood-vessels, and with several Nerves, from the superior and inferior Vessels and Nerves of the Larynx. It is likewise furnished with numerous Lymphatics.â€”But no Excretory Duct has ever been observed to come from it; nor is its office yet understood, though many opinions have been en- tertained respecting it.

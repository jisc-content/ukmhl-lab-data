Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 205 the Thorax, it proceeds behind the Base of the Heart, and between the Layers of the Posterior Mediastinum, from which it receives a lateral covering. Soon after entering the Thorax, it makes a slight turn to the right, and passes down upon the fore and right side of the Aorta ; consequently the Artery and it are prevented from injuring each other by pressure. In its progress, it inclines more forwards and to the left side ; and about the ninth Dorsal Vertebra, it per- forates the Muscular part of the Diaphragm, and after- wards terminates in the upper Orifice of the Stomach. It has several Coats proper to it, the first of which is Cellular, and connects it to the adjacent parts. The second Coat is Muscular, and is sometimes termed Vaginalis Gulce.—It consists of two Layers; the external of which has thick, strong, longitudinal Fibres, somewhat fasciculated. A portion of these ascends some way up the Pharynx on each side, to be fixed to the back part of its Inner Membrane. The internal Layer is formed of circular or transverse Fi- bres, and is thinner than the former.—The outer Layer is fitted for shortening and relaxing, and the inner for contracting the Canal, during Deglutition. The third Coat is termed Nervous, and is consider- ed by some as a continuation of the Cutis Vera, but is more properly called Cellular, being formed of loose Cellular Substance, which connects the Muscular to the Inner Coat. The Inner Coat is continued from the lining of the Mouth ; it consists of many longitudinal Plicce, which are distinctly seen when the Esophagus is contracted, but are scarcely visible when the Tube is dilated.

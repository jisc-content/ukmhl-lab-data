2>a8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Ligament of the Colon. Here, as on the right side, it forms a partial covering to the Colon, the Gut being connected behind by Cellular Substance only. It afterwards expands, adheres to the Psoas Mag- nus, and forms a Loose Fold, which retains the Sig- moid Flexure of the Colon. At the last Vertebra of the Loins, it forms the Meso- rectum, which by degrees becomes narrower, and dis- appears towards the under part of the Pelvis; the Rectum being then immediately connected to the Os S^acrum. Between the Layers of the Meso-colon are-placed the Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, with the Absorbents and Glands of the Colon. The Mesentery, in general, suspends, connects, and retains the Intestines in their places, but allows them a certain degree of motion; it furnishes them with an ex- ternal Coat, receives their Glands, Vessels, and Nerves, and allows the two last to be properly distributed. Omentum. The Omentum or Caul, formerly called Epiploon, from its seeming to float upon the Intestines, is a fine Membranous Bag, produced from the Peritoneum, and intermixed with much Fat, and covers a large portion of the Anterior Surface of the Abdominal Viscera. It is divided into Omentum Gastro-colicum and Omen- tum-colicum; the former common to the Stomach and Colon, the latter proper to the Colon : They are, how- ever, a continuation of one and the same Substance. The Omentum Gastro-colicum consists of an Anterior

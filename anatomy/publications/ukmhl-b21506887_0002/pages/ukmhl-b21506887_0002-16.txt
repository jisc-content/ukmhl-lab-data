4 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. a Foetus, thickest in the Palms and Soles; in which parts, the thickness is afterwards much increased by pressure, and then a lamellated structure is evident. The External Surface is marked by Furrows^ which correspond with those in the Cutis Vera, Upon the Surface of the Body, it is perforated by the terminations of Vessels for the Exhalation of the Perspirable Matter; which, when increased in quan- tity, is considered by most of the modern Physiologists as forming the Sweat. It is perforated also by the ends of the Excretory Ducts, which are found only in par- ticular parts of the Skin; by the beginning of the Ab- sorbents, which take in certain Substances applied to the Surface of the Body ; and by the different Hairs. The Perforations^ or Pores^ are most evident upon the Palms and Soles, and upon the Nose^ Ears, and external parts of Generation, yet, in a separate piece of Cuticle, the Pores are as invisible as they are in a piece of wet filtrating paper, though obvious when the paper is dry. The Cuticle covers the Skin through its whole ex- tent, excepting under the Nails. From the external Surface of the Body, it is reflect- ed inwards^ to line the large passages ; as the Nose, Mouth, Alimentary Canal, the Trachea, Urethra, Va- gina, &c. In these passages, however, the Cuticle becomes less uniform in its texture ; and in some of them, as in the Stomach, it is either wanting, or is so much changed in structure, as to have the appearance of being so. From the Surface of the Cuticle, certain Processes

319 Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Changed Produced in the Uterine System by Impregnation. Immediately after Impregnation, a large Orifice is constantly observed in the Ovarium, leading to a Ca- vity in that part of it where the Rudiments of the Foetus have been derived. This Cavity appears first flocculent, and is afterwards filled up, during Gestation, though sometimes not till several Months afterwards, by a Granulous Substance, which has the name of Corpus Luteum, from the yellow appearance it assumes, especially in Quadrupeds. The Corpus Luteum projects from some part of the Surface of one of the Ovaria. It is of a roundish or oval form, and consists of an outer Vascular, and inner inorganic-looking, pale-coloured Substance, which has been considered by some Authors as the remains of the Ovum. A real Corpus Luteum is not found till after Impreg- nation, though diseased appearances of the Ova have sometimes been shewn as such. The Corpus Luteum continues till the end of Pregnancy, and for some time after Delivery, when it gradually vanishes, but leaves a Scar in the Ovarium, which continues for life. In the case of a single child, a Corpus Luteum is only found in one Ovarium ; when there are Twins, a Cor- pus Luteum is observed in each Ovarium, or two Cor- pora Lutea in one Ovarium, and none in the other ; the number of Corpora Lutea always corresponding with that of the Ova impregnated. After the Embryo is received into the Cavity of the

308 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [pAR-rlV, After the periodical Evacuations have begun, they recur generally every fourth Week while the Person is in perfect health, though the period varies a little in different Women. They cease during Pregnancy and Suckling, but there are now and then instances to the contrary. The duration of each Menstruation is also various ; in general they continue to flow for three or four days, in which time five or six ounces are commonly discharg- ed. But the duration and quantity are for ordinary less in the robust, and in cold Climates, and more in those of relaxed habits, or living in hot Countries. From the Surface of the Vagina, part of the Men- strual Flux has by many been also supposed to be de- rived ; but those who have seen the discharge from the Uterus, in cases of a Prolapsus of that Organ, do not take notice of having observed any evacuation directly from this passage. The Menses for ordinary begin to be interrupted a- bout the fortieth year, and commonly disappear about the forty-fifth, but soonest in Women where they have begun most early. After this period, Impregnation generally does not take place. According to Experiments made by Mr Bbande, upon the Menstrual Discharge, collected from a Wo- man with a Prolapsus of the Uterus, it had the pro- perties of a very concentrated solution of the Colouring Matter of the Blood in a diluted Serum, though he could detect no traces of Iron by the usual modes of Analysis. Dr F. Lavagna concludes, from some ex- periments on the Menstrual Blood, that it differs from pure Blood only in the want of Fibrin.

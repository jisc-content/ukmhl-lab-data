290 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. a Septitm^ formed by a continuation of the Elastic Ligaments which cover these Bodies. The Septum Penis is composed of thin Tendinous- like Cords, extending across, nearly in a parallel direc- tion, from the Dorsum Penis to the Corpus Spongio- sum Urethras, and thus guarding against an over-dis^ tension. Between the different Cords, jPmwr^^ are left, through which the Blood, or an injected Fluid, passes without obstruction from one of the Corpora Cavernosa to the other ; rendering the Penis in this manner one general Cavity, separated by the Septum into two apartments. The Corpus Spongiosum Urethrce is situated under and between the Corpora Cavernosa Penis, but projects considerably beyond them. It begins a little behind the part where the Corpora Cavernosa are united, adheres to them by condensed Cellular Substance, and terminates at the anterior ex- tremity of the Penis. It has an external covering similar to that of the Corpora Cavernosa Penis, but more delicate, and has more of a Membranous appearance. The Posterior part of the Corpus Spongiosum is di- lated into a large Pendulous Process, of a Conical form, situated within the Skin of the Peritoneum, and term- ed Bulb of the Urethra. The Bulb extends from the root of the Penis to near the Anus. It projects most towards the under and back part, is divided anteriorly by a Septum, and is covered at its under and lateral parts by the Accele- ratores Urinae, and by a thin Layer of Tendinous Fibres, which assist in bracing this part of the Penis.

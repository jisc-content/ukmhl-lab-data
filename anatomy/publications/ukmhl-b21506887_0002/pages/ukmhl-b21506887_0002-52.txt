40 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet IV. A little lower than the Testes, the Ventricle becomes wider, and forms an Angle behind, from which again it contracts, and, becoming narrower and pointed be- low like a writing-pen, it has got the name of Calamus Scriptorius. Over the under end of the Aquasductus Sylvii, and upper part of the Fourth Ventricle, there is a thin Me- dullary Lamina, called Valvula, but properly Velum ViEUSSENII. At the sides of the Velum Vieussenii, there are two Medullary Tracts, called Processus ad Testes, or Co- lumnce Valvules Vieussenii. The under end of the Ventricle is found to be shut up by its Choroid Plexus, which prevents any commu- nication between this Cavity and that of the Spine. UNDER SURFACE OF THE BRAIN. Upon inverting the Brain, the Lobes already taken notice of appear in a conspicuous manner, their form, and irregularities of their Surface, corresponding with the inner Surface of the Base of the Cranium. At the fore part of the Brain, the Fissure between the Hemispheres extends a considerable way back be- tween the anterior Lobes. Behind this Fissure is observed the union of the Op- tic Nerves which are to be afterwards described. Near the middle of the Base of the Brain, and be- tween its Lateral Lobes, there are two small, round, white Bodies, termed EminenticB Mammillares, vel Cor- pora Albicafitia, Medullary without, and Cineritious within, mistaken by some Authors for Glands.

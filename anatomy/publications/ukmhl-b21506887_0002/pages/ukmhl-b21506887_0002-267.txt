Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 217 Cutis Vera, strengthens the Stomach, and allows the Vessels to be distributed to the Inner Coat, with which it is intimately connected. The Fourth, or Inner Coat, called also Villous, and by the Ancients Fungous, is continued from the Inner Coat of the Esophagus, but has much more of a Vel- vet appearance than it.—It is formed of fine, short, prominent Villi, which are crowded with small Vessels, some for furnishing a Mucous Liquor to the Stomach, others for absorbing a portion of the thinner parts of the Food. The two last Coats are more extensive than the rest, and form, upon the inner part of the Stomach, many Doublings, termed Rugce, the greater number of which run in a waving transverse direction, and are afterwards divided into a sort of Net-work, Near the Orifices, however, they have more of a longitudinal course. At the Cardia the Rugae have a radiated appearance, the Radii corresponding with the longitudinal Plicas at the under end of the'Esophagus. This radiated part has been considered by some late V\^riters as the termina- tion of the Cuticle, or as tiiai: Membrane after reach- ing the Stomach, being altered in its texture. The Rugae of the Stomach, like the Plicae of the Esophagus, are most distinct when the Stomach is empty ;—when it is full, they are much less evident. They admit of distension, without endangering the Vessels and Nerves dispersed in them, and assist a little in detaining the Aliment till properly digested. From the inner Surface of the Stomach, a Liquor issues, termed Gastric Juice, which has something of the general appearance of the Saliva, but is different in its

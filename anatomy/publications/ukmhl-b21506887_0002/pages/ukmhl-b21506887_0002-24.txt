12 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Skin, and in passing from it they carry with them Pro- cesses of the Epidermis, which serve them as Sheaths, and which are so thin and transparent, as to allow the colour of the Hair to appear through them. In the Human Body, the Hairs are so slender, that it is difficult to trace their structure ; but in the strong Hairs of certain Quadrupeds, this becomes apparent. By the assistance of a good Glass, these strong Hairs are observed to be composed of a bundle of smaller Hairs, among which are one or two Canals for con-x taining their nourishing Fluid, termed the Medulla. By desiccation, the Hairs separate at their points into thin constituent Filaments. The Hairs, like the Nails, grow from their bases, in consequence of which, when they are cut short, they seem to increase in number, though it is only in dia- meter. The Hairs, like the Cuticle, appear to be destitute of Blood-vessels, Lymphatics, and Nerves. The Hairs serve in general for the ornament, warmth, or protection of the different parts on or near which they are placed. The chemical properties of Hairs are nearly the same with those of Cartilage, Cuticle, Horn, &c. By late experiments it is found, that Hair, boiled in water in Papin's Digester, can be completely dissolv- ed ; that when Hair is digested in Alcohol, it is de- prived of its colour, an oily fluid, considered as the cause of this colour, having been dissolved by the Al- cohol ; and that each of the Acids acts very sensibly upon the Hair.

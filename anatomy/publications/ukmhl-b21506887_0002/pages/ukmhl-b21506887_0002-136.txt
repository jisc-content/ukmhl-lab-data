lOS COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt IV. under the termination of the Common Canal in the Ves- tibule, from which it descends, and terminates by a Triangular Opening between the Layers of the Dura Mater, behind the Meatus Internus, and half way be- tween the upper edge of the Pars Petrosa and Diver- ticulum of the Internal Jugular Vein. The Newes of the Labyrinth are derived entirely from the Auditory or Seventh Pair. The Auditory Nerve is composed of two Branches, one of which is called Portio Dura, and is harder than the other, termed Portio Mollis. The Trunk of the Auditory Nerve passes into the Meatus Internus, covered by the investing Membranes of the Brain. The Portio Dura goes through the Canalis Fallo- pii, sending off Branches through Perforations in the sides of the Canal> to the Stapedius, and to the Mas- toid Cells. One reflected Branch, from the second part of the Fifth Pair, passing through the Foramen Innominatum in the Pars Petrosa, forms a connexion with the Portio Dura. A Branch from the Portio Dura, called Chorda Tyrnpani, passes across the Cavity of the Tympanum, between the Inferior Crus of the Incus and Handle of the Malleus, and, after running along the outside of the EusTACHiAK Tube, joins the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair. In its passage, it supplies the Mal- leus, and Membranes, &c. of the Tympanum. The remainder of the Portio Dura is dispersed upon the Face. The iPortio Mollis is divided into two principal parts,

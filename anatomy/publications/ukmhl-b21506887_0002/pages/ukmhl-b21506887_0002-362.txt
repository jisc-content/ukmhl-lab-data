/ ^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Reservoirs of the Semen, receiving it from the Vasa I>eferentia5 and afterwards, by a power inherent in themselves, assisted by the action of the neighbouring Muscles, particularly of the Levatores Ani,—propel- ling it into the Urethra. The Semen is prevented from passing into the Blad- der, the beginning of the Urethra being shut while that Fluid is expelled. Notwithstanding the common received opinion re- garding the use of the Vesiculse Seminales, various ex- periments have been made on these Bodies by the late Mr Hunter, from which he was led to believe that Ihey are not Reservoirs of Semen, but Glands secret- ing a p^irticular Mucus ;—that, with other parts, they are subservient to the purposes of Generation ;—and that the Bulb of the Urethra is the Receptacle of the Semen, in which it is accumulated previous to its ejec- tion. The Semen, when recently ejected, is observed to be a, whitish Viscid Fluid, of a peculiar odour, and to be- come more transparent and fluid by exposure to the Air. It is found to contain a great proportion of VV"a- ter, some Mucilage, Phosphate of Lime, and Soda. Leeuenhoeck, by the aid of a Microscope, detect- ed in it innumerable Animalcula, which he has parti- cularly described in the Philosophical Transactions of last centurv. The Prostate Gland, or Corpus Glandulosum, lies immediately behind the under end of the Symphysis Pubis, and rests upon the Intestinum Rectum, to both of which it is connected by Cellular Substance.

SOO COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. chea, and forms at last the extreme Branches, which terminate in the Cells of the'Lungs. The inner Membrane of the Trachea is every where perforated by the Ducts of Mucous Glands, and by the Mouths of the Eochalent Arteries, the former pouring out Mucus to lubricate the Lungs, the latter the va- pour which is thrown off in Expiration. Three different kinds of Glands are connected with the Trachea,—the Thyroid, which has already been described, the Tracheal, and the Bronchial. The Tracheal Glands are small, but numerous, and of different sizes, surrounding the Muscular Coat of the Trachea, and its Branches in the Lungs;—the lar- gest of them are placed in the Fleshy Substances be- hind, the smallest are situated between the Cartilagi- nous Rings, and appear to have been overlooked by Authors in general. From each of these Glands a small Duct issues, and throws out a Mucus to defend the inner Surface of the Trachea from being injured by the Air, or by the ex- traneous particles which it carries along with it. The Bronchial Glands are placed in the Cellular Substance round the under end of the Trachea and roots of the Bronchi, where these penetrate into the Substance of the Lungs. They are of various sizes, from that of the point of the Little Finger to that of a millet-seed, and have a bluish or blackish colour, corresponding in a great mea- sure with the colour of the darkest parts of the Lungs. They were formerly considered by many Authors as sending Fluids to the Trachea, and particularly the dark Mucus which is occasionally expectorated ; but

Past IV.J OF THE VISCERA, &c. 19 *■ The Diira Mater serves as a defence to the Brain, and supplies the place of a Periosteum to the inside of the Bones of the Cranium; giving nourishment to them,-—as is evident from the numerous drops of Blood which appear after removing the Skull-cap- From the inner side of the Dura Mater^ Proiesses are sent o% which divide the Brain into certain parts, and serve to keep it steady; viz. the Falx, Tento- aiuM, and Falx Minor, The Falx, Septum Cerebri^ or Vertical Superior Longitudinal Process^ iii formed by a doubling of the Dura Mater, and is situated between the Hemispheres of the Brain, which it separates from each other for a considerable way downwards. It begins at the middle of the Sphenoid Bone, and Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone, and runs along the upper and middle part of the Head, adhering first to the Frontal Bone, then to the Sagittal Suture, and afterwards to the middle of the Occipital Bone. In its passage, it becomes gradually broader, extend- ing from the Cranium above, to near the part of the Brain below termed Corpus Callosum^ and terminates behind, in the middle of the Tentorium. It runs from before backwards in a straight direc- tion, and has some resemblance in shape to a Sickle or Scythe, from which circumstance it has obtained the name of Falx, Between the under edge of the Falx and Base of the Cranium, there is a large space of an oval form, occu- pied by that part of the Brain which is common to the two Hemispheres, B ^

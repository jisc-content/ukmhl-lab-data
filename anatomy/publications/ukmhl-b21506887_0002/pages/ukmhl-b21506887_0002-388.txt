312 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. from entering the Vagina.—They also tend to enlarge the passage for the Child in the time of Parturition. Between the Perineum and Nymphae, there is a Ves^ tibulum, or smooth Cavity, which is most complete in Virgins, and leads to two Passages,^to the Urethra above, and to the Vagina below. The Orifice of the Urethra is placed a little below the Glans of the Clitoris, and between the two Nym^ phse, and is surrounded by a Vascular Spongy Emi- nence, which projects at its under part,—called by some Authors Corpus Glandulosumy vel Glandulce ProstatcB Mulierum. The Corpus Glandulosum is perforated by Lacunas ; some of which are of considerable depth, and discharge a Viscid Matter round the Orifice of the Urethra. The Corpus Glandulosum directs the point of the Finger to the Orifice of the Urethra, without the as- sistance of the Eye, in discharging the Urine by a Catheter. The Orifice of the Vagina^ termed likewise Os Ex- ternum Uteri, is placed immediately under that of the Urethra, and is naturally straiter than the rest of the Canal; but in the Virgin state, is still more contracted by the Substance called Hymen, or Circulus Membra^ nosus, which forms an incomplete Septum between the Vagina and External Parts. The Hymen is formed of a double Membrane, and is red and sensible like the Vagina itself, the inner part being derived from that Canal, the outer from the La- bia Pudendi. It approaches to a circular figure, but the Circle is frequently incomplete next the Orifice of

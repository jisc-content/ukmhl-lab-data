108 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. run from before backwards, and are described by Hal- LER, according to their situations, viz. The Meatus Narium Superior^ placed at the upper, inner, and back part of the Superior Spongy Bone. The Meatus Medius, situated between the Superior and Inferior Spongy Bones. The Meatus Ijiferior, situated between the Inferior Spongy Bone and bottom of the Nose. The inside of the Nose is lined by a thick Spongy Substance, termed Membrana Mucosa, or Membrana Pituitaria of Schneider, or Membrana Schneideri^ ANA, which adheres to the Periosteum, and is also con- tinued into the different Sinuses, to the Lacrymal Sacs and Palatine Ducts, to the Pharynx, Palate, and Eu- stachian Tubes. This Membrane is very Vascular and Nervous, and is the Primary Organ of Smelling. It is constantly lubricated and preserved in a proper degree of mois-. ture by the Mucus of the Nose, which is discharged from numerous small Follicles, every where dispersed over the Surface of that Membrane. The Passages of the different Sinuses of the Bones of the Head, after having run obliquely backwards in a short winding direction, terminate by small openings in the Cavity of the Nose. The Frontal Sinuses send Passages downwards to the anterior Ethmoid Cells, which terminate in the upper part of the Nose, behind the beginning of the Lacrymal Sacs. Besides the Passages common to the Frontal Sinuses and anterior Ethmoid Cells, there are others proper to the posterior Ethmoid Cells, which terminate in the

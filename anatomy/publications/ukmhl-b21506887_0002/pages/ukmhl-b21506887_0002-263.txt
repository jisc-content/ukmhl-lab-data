Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 213 The right portion of the Stomach is situated under the left part of the Liver, the rest of it is placed im- mediately under the Diaphragm; and in the upright position of the Body, the Stomach rests upon the In- testines. The Stomach is long, round, and tapering, and has been compared in shape to the Bag of a Bagpipe, or to a Cone, with the Base drawn back towards the summit; but in certain morbid cases, the Stomach is found spas- modically contracted at its great curvature, near the Pylorus, so as to represent two Sacs of unequal size. This appearance commonly vanishes soon after death, though in some cases it remains permanent. Contrac- tions of a similar nature are frequently met with in the tract of the Intestinal Canal. The size of the Stomach is in proportion to the quan- tity of Aliment it has been accustomed to receive, and therefore is commonly larger in Men than in Women. It has a Large and Small Extremity^ an Upper and Under Surface^ a Great and Small Curvature^ a Zg/Band Right Orifice^ and consists of several Layers or Coats, The Large, called also the Left Extremity or Base, is situated in the Left Hypochondriac Region, and forms the great Cul de Sac of the French. This is in contact with the Spleen, and is considerably higher than the Small or Right Extremity, or small Cul de Sac, which is placed in the Epigastric Region, and approaches more or less towards the Right Hypochon- drium, in proportion as the Stomach happens to be more or less distended. The Upper Surface is turned towards the Diaphragm,

26 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Between the PIemispheres, and at the bottom of the fissure already taken notice of, a broad white Substance is observed, called Corpus Callosum, from its being a little firmer than the rest of the Brain. It goes across the Brain, under the Falx, and is merely a continuation of the Medullary Substance, running horizontally, and joining the two sides of the Hemispheres to each other. It is narrow before, broader behind, and is arched or turned a little down at its anterior and posterior edges* In the middle of the Corpus Callosum, there is a longitudinal Raphe, a Linea Mediana, with a Medul- lary Cord on each side, from which many Transverse Streaks issue. These Cords, like the Corpus Callosum itself, become gradually broader towards the Posterior Extremity. A Section of the Hemispheres of the Brain shews the division into outer and inner, or Cortical and Medullary Substance. If this Section be made in a horizontal di- rection, a little above the middle height of the Brain, or upon a level with the Corpus Callosum, the Medul- lary Substance then appears in the greatest proportion. The outer Substance is also termed Cineritious, from its somewhat resembling the ashes of wood, of being of a greyish colour, though a little tinged with brown, the tinge varying according to the quantity and quality of the Fluid contained in the Blood-vessels;â€” and Corticalf from its surrounding" the inner part of the Brain, as the Bark does the inner part of a Tree. It is termed by some Authors Glandular, and by others Secretory, from a supposition that the Fluid was secreted in it. The CineritiousSubstance covers the Brain in general.

m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Fart IV. Each of these openings is fixed by a Retinaculum formed by the inner Coat of the Bladder. This passes obliquely inwards and forwards, but is more distinctly seen when a Frobe is introduced into the Orifice, and the part gently raised. Between the terminations of the two Ureters, and extending from these to the beginning of the Urethra, is a space of a triangular form,—the Trigone of Lieu- TAUD, which is sometimes distinguished by being of a whiter colour than the rest of the Bladder. The Arteries of the Bladder come from various sources, but chiefly from the Umbilicalis and Fudenda Communis. The Veins return to the Internal Iliacs :—They form a Flexus of considerable size upon each side of the Bladder, particularly about its Neck. The Lymphatics accompany the principal Veins on the Bladder, and, at the under part and sides, pass in- to the Iliac Glands. The Nerves are Branches of the Great Sympathetic and Sacral Nerves. The Bladder receives the Urine from the Ureters by drops; and sometimes by small Thread-like streams or squirts, till, by its accumulated quantity and acri- mony, it forces the Organ to contract and expel it. The Urine is expelled, partly by the contraction of the Bladder itself, and partly by the action of the Ab- dominal Muscles and Diaphragm pressing the Intes- tines against the Bladder, the Sphincter Vesicae being at the same time relaxed. The frequency of the evacuation depends upon the size and sensibility of the Bladder, upon the quantity of

38 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. It is somewhat of a roundish form, though a little flattened above, and about an inch broader from one side to the other than from before backwards. It is only about a sixth part of the size of the Cerebrum, and less complex. It is divided behind by the Falx Minor into two Lobes or Hemispheres, which, like the Hemispheres . of the Brain proper, have a general similarity to each other in the opposite sides of the Head, but it has no separation above, like that of the Cerebrum. Its colour is similar to that of the Brain, and it is divided into numerous Circumvolutions, forming Arches in many parts, with their Convexities turned outwards, which decussate each other at sharp angles The Circumvolutions run chiefly in a Lateral direc- tion, and are formed of Laminae, with Sulci between them, varying much in depth, into which, as in the Brain, the Pia Mater insinuates itself, and binds them together. This may be readily seen by making a Punc- ture into the Arachnoid Coat, and blov/ing in Air, till it distends the Cellular Substance, and separates the Coats from each other. It has two middle Eminences, called Appendices Ver^ mifbrmes, from their resemblance to Earth-worms, one of which is situated anteriorly or superiorly, the other inferiorly or posteriorly ; or there is a Superior and an Inferior Vermiform Process. Each of the Lobes of the Cerebellum is again di- vided into Monticuli or Lobules, which have different names according to their relative situations, connexions with other parts, &c. They vary a little in different

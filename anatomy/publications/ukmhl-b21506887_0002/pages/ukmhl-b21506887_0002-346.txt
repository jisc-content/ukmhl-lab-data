COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. violent death from suspension by the Neck, it is con- tracted into a small size ; is then somewhat triangular, but rounded at the corners; occupies only the under and fore part of the Pelvis ; when moderately distend- ed, it is still contained in that Cavity ; but, when much dilated, it rises above the Ossa Pubis, and sometimes, as in a retention of Urine, ascends to within a little distance of the Umbilicus. It then almost completely fills the Cavity of the Pelvis, especially if the Rectum be empty. When moderately dilated, it is of a roundish, or ir- regular oblong form, but a little flattened before, more convex behind, and broader at its anterior and poste- rior than towards its lateral parts,â€”a little more capa- cious, also, below than above, especially at its posterior part. In People advanced in life, and of a relaxed habit, the Bladder is sometimes divided at its under part, in- to two Lateral Portions, in which Calculi are occasion- ally lodged. The Bladder is distinguished into Fundus, Body, and Cervix; the first of which is placed upwards and a little forwards, and the last at the under and fore part. It is connected below to the Rectum, and at the sides to the Pelvis, by the reflected Peritoneum and Cellular Substance; the former of which, when the Bladder is empty, has the appearance of Lateral Ligaments. It is attached, at the fore part of its Body, by Cellu- lar Substance, somewhat condensed, to the Ossa Pubis, without the intervention of the Peritoneum ; this be- comes thicker and stronger towards the Neck of the

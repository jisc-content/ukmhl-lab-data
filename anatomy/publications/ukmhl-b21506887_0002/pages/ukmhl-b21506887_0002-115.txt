The External Ear comprehends the Auricle^ or Ear properly so called, and the Meatus Auditorius Externus. It is again divided into Pinna or Ala, which consti- tutes by much the greater part of it, and Lohus^ which is placed at its under end. The Pinna is chiefly composed of Cartilage, and is divided, at its fore part, into several Eminences and Cavities, which have received particular names ; viz. The Helix, or outer Bar or Margin, which arises behind, at the Lobe of the Ear, surrounds its upper edge, and terminates below, nearly opposite to its ori- gin ; dividing the Concha into two parts.

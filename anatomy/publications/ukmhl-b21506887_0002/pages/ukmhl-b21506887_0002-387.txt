Paet IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 311 It is covered by a continuation of the Skin of the Labia, which, at its inferior extremity, forms a Semi- lunar Fold, termed Preputium CUtoridis. The Prepuce is furnished with Glandules Odoriferm upon its inner Surface, and with a small Frsenum be- low, which fixes it to the Glans. The Clitoris possesses great sensibility. In the time of Coition, the Glans Clitoridis is supposed to produce nearly the same sensation in a Female, as the Glans Penis does in a Male, At the under and outer part of the Clitoris are two Bodies, called Nymphce, which arise narrow from the Prepuce and Glans, and run obliquely downwards and outwards along the inside of the Labia, increasing in breadth, but suddenly contracting again in size at their lower extremity. They are chiefly formed by a production of the in- side of the Labia, have the same florid colour with them, and in their natural state are contiguous, and cover the Orifice of the Urethra. They are sometimes of unequal size, and not unfre- quently, particularly in warm Climates, project beyond the edges of the Labia. In Hottentot Women, they are said to hang pendulous between the Thighs. Their internal Structure consists of Cellular Sub- stance, with a large proportion of Blood-vessels: They have also many Nervous Papillae, which render them very sensible ; and Sebaceous Follicles, the contents of which, of a Fetid nature, prevent them from being iur jured by the Urine. The Nymphae assist in directing the course of the Urine from the Urethra, and in preventing the Air

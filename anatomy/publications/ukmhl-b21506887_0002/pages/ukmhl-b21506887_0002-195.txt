The Epiglottis breaks the current of Air coming from the Mouth and Nose, and prevents it from rush- ing too forcibly into the Cavity of the Lungs. Pressed and drawn down by the Tongue and by small Muscles, it defends the Glottis, and shuts it completely in the time of swallowing. After the action of swallowing, it is raised by its own elasticity, and by the root of the Tongue, to which it is fixed ; ascending again to its former position. Ligamenta Thyro-arytenoidea^ or Ligaments of the Glottis.â€”From the fore part of the Body of each of the Arytenoid Cartilages, a Ligamentous Cord, about three quarters of an inch in length, passes horizontally forwards, to be fixed by its other extremity, at the side of its fellow, to the inner Surface of the anterior Angle of the Thyroid Cartilage. ' ' The Opening formed between these Ligaments is called Glottis, Mouth of the Larynx^ and Rima Glotti- dis, and is of a triangular figure, the Ligaments being in contact before, but at a considerable distance from each other at their posterior extremities, the Cricoid Cartilage forming the back part of the triangle. Under these two Ligaments, there are two others, larger and more distinct than the former, and which are commonly considered as the Vocal Ligaments, or the proper Ligaments of the Glottis, upon which Voice more immediately depends. They arise from the Base of the Arytenoid Cartilages, and run in the same di- rection with the former, to be fixed also to the Thyroid C artilage.

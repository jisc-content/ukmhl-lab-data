COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Arteries, especially in cases where they have run some way in a straight course, or where they are of unequal length, frequently form short Coils upon themselves. Sometimes there is a knot upon the Cord. Now and then the Navel String forms one or more turns about the Neck of the Child. Sometimes, though very rarely, there is only a single Artery. The Trunks of the Vessels are not provided with that strong external covering belonging to the Blood- vessels in other parts of the Body, but are inclosed in a Gelatinous, Ropy, Cellular Substance, which adds to the strength and elasticity of the Cord, and allows the Blood to pass freely between the Foetus and Placenta, without being in danger of interruption from pressure* The Vein is much larger than the Arteries, its area being about equal to the area of both of these. It is destitute of Valves, and sends off no branches while running in the Cord. It arises from the Substance of the Placenta, and, after perforating the Umbilicus, it passes in the infe- rior part of the Ligamentum Suspensorium, to the under side of the Liver. The Arteries arise from the Iliac Arteries of the Foe- tus, pei'forate the Umbilicus, and run to the Placenta, in the Substance of which they divide into their ulti- mate Branches, but send off no Ramifications in their course through the Cord. When they reach the Pla- centa, the Trunk of the one Artery frequently forms a large Anastomosis with that of the other, and the Ramifications of the Arteries communicate with those of the Vein, in the manner Arteries and Veins do in other parts of the Body.

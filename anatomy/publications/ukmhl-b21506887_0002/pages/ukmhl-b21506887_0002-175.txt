Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. IBS The backmost Molares are termed Denies Sapien- ticB^ from appearing later than the rest of the Teeth. They are smaller than the other Molares, and have generally fewer roots ; these are often quite indistinct, as if squeezed together ; and frequently there is only a single Fang. The Dentes Sapientise of the Under J aw have fre- quently curved roots, and are sometimes placed so obliquely inwards, as scarcely to appear beyond the Oums. The Incisores of the Upper being for the most part much broader than those of the Under Jaw, the other Teeth are thrown farther back than the corresponding Teeth of the Under one ; in consequence of which, in well-formed Teeth, when the Jaws are shut, those of the Upper are opposed to the Interstices of the Teeth of the Under one, and the third Molares of the Up- per being smaller than those of the Under, allow the Teeth to close even at their posterior parts. By such a construction, the Teeth are properly adapt- ed to the Manducation of the Food; and one Tooth being lost, its opponent remains useful, by acting upon the parts of the Teeth immediately opposed to it, Of the Temporary Teeth, In a Foetus of three or four Months after Conception, the Jaws are distinctly formed ; but in place of Sockets, there are Grooves running along the Jaws, with im- pressions within them, forming the origins of the fu- ture Alveoli.

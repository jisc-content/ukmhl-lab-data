74 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet IV. The different Muscles of the Eye, where they lie upon the Ball, are covered with a Cellular Sheath, which afterwards degenerates into that Cellular Sub- stance which is interposed between the Sclerotica and Conjunctiva. The Recti Muscles move the Eye according to their respective situations. When two of the opposite Recti act, or all of them act together, they draw the Eye into the Orbit. When two of the adjacent Recti act, they turn the fore part of the Eye obliquely in a direction towards their origins. The Oblique Muscles, acting separately, roll the Eye according to their situation and the direction of their Fibres ; moving conjunctly, they draw the Eye forward, and become the antagonists of the Recti.

PaetIV.] of the viscera, &c. 79 That the rays of light may terminate distinctly on the Retina, it is necessary that both the Cornea and Crystalline Lens should have a certain degree of con- vexity. If either the one or the other be too prominent, the Focus will be formed before it reach the Retina, as is the case in short-sighted people, who require concave glasses to enable them to see objects distinctly, at the proper and ordinary distance. If, on the contrary, the Cornea or Lens be too flat, or the refractive power of the Humours be in any way diminished, the Focus will then fall behind the Retina, and be imperfectly formed, till the object is viewed at a greater distance than ordinary, as is the case with persons advanced in life, to whom the assistance of convex glasses becomes necessary. How an object, viewed with both Eyes, appears single, has been, as well as our judging of the real situa- tion of any object, ascribed by the generality of Au- thors to custom and habit; and by others to instinct, which regulates the uniform motion of the Eyes, and the accurate application of both to one point. The Eye is enabled to judge of, or accommodate it- self to, objects at different distances, by the action of its Muscles increasing or diminishing the length of its Axis, and by the motions of the Iris allowing a greater or smaller quantity of light to be thrown into the Eye.

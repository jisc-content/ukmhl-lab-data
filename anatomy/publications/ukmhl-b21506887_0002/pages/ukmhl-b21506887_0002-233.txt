Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 18S From the extreme Arteries of the Lungs, corre- sponding Veins arise, which are merely the continua- tion or reflection of the Arteries, without any interme- diate Cells or dilatations. The Pulmonary Veins, in the Substance of the Lungs, gradually unite, and form Four Principal Truiiks, which terminate in, and carry the Blood to, the left Auricle. Of the Pulmonary Veins, two come from the right, and two likewise from the left Lung, which are some- what smaller than those from the right; and the whole terminate in the corresponding sides of the left Auricle, towards its upper and back part. The Left Auricle is considerably thicker and stronger than the Right, and is also divided into Sinus Venosus and Proper Auricle, which form one Common Cavity, without the intervention of any Valve. The Left Sinus Vejiasus^ called also Sinus Pulmona- liSy is tui'ned towards the Spine, is more of a cubical form than the Right one, but resembles it in the uni- formity and smoothness of its outer and inner Surfaces, also in its Colour, which is paler than that of the Ven- tricles. From the fore and left part of the Sinus, the Proper Auricle projects, and forms a distinct flat Appendix or Bag^ which is twisted, has diff*erent Curvatures or In- dentations upon its edges, and points forwards, and to the left side. The inner part of the Proper Auricle is longer, but narrower, than that on the right side; like it, however, it is formed of Columnse, with Furrows between them, but these less distinct than those in the other Auricle.

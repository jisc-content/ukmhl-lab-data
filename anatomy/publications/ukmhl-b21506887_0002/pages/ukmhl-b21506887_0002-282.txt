COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Second or Muscular Coat, as in the Stomach, is composed of two Planes of Fibres ; the External or Longitudinal of which are much more minute than the Internal. The Circular Fibres are distinct and numerous: They consist of Segments of Circles, which unite with each other at different distances, so as to surround the Canal. The Longitudinal Fibres shorten, and the Circular contract the Intestines ; and upon the alternate relaxa- tion and contraction of these Fibres depends that Ver- micular motion forwards and backwards in the Canal, or that motion called Peristaltic bm^. Anti-Peristaltic, by which the Aliments are intimately intermixed, the nu- tritive part applied to the Mouths of the Lacteals, and the faeculent part is discharged. The Third, commonly called Nervous Coat, like that in the Stomach, is white and firm, and composed of Cellular Substance without Fat;â€”its firmness giv- ing strength to the Intestines. This Coat, like the corresponding one in the Eso- phagus and Stomach, though Cellular, forms a distinct Lamina, and, as in those parts of the Canal just men- tioned, has by some been compared to the Cutis Vera covering the external Surface of the Body, though it is much looser in its texture. The Fourth, or Villous Coat, differs from that of the Stomach, in being proportionally more extensive, and in forming, with the Cellular Coat, numerous trans- verse Plicae or Folds, about an eighth part of an inch in breadth, termed Valvulce Conniventes, from their serving as a kind of imperfect Valves, to retard the motion of the Food.

COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Oxygen, contained in the Air which has been inspired, unites with the Carbon and Hydrogen, and forms fixed Air and a watery Halitus, which are carried off by Expiration.—Others suppose that part of the Oxygen of the Atmosphere is imbibed by the Blood, which, in consequence of these changes, or having received an Arterial quality, returns from the Lungs of a florid red colour, and full of heat in a latent state ; that this, in the course of the general circulation, by the Oxygen uniting with the Carbon, and forming Carbonic Acid, becomes sensible, and is diffused over the different parts of the Body, the Carbonic Acid being carried by the Veins to the Lungs, where it is evolved.—According to the latest Experiments, however, it is stated that the Blood, during the Circulation, acquires an excess of Carbon, which, in its passage through the Lungs, unites with the Oxygen of the Air, and forms Carbonic Acid ; and that thus the Venous i§ changed into Arterial Blood, which, owing to this change, affords a stimulus to the Arteries, and promotes the different Secretions. Esophagus. The Esophagus, called also Gula or Gullet, derives its name from carrying what is eaten into the Stomach. It is a Fleshy Canal, which begins from the inferior part of the Pharynx, descends along the Neck, and through the Thorax, following nearly the direction of the Spine. It is situated between the Trachea and Vertebrae, and in the Neck inclines a little to the left side. In

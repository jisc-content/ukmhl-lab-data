176 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. rior edge, convex or rounded anteriorly, and terminates obliquely in an obtuse point, which turns backwards and to the right side. The Sinus and Proper Auricle form one common Cavity, have no Valve between them, and are there- fore filled and emptied at the same time. Where the two Cavoe meet in the Hearts of Quadru- peds, there is a Projection in the Sinus Venosus, called Tuherculum Loweri, which is supposed to prevent the Blood of the one Cava from rushing upon that of the other, and to direct it into the Auricle. At the meeting of the two Cavae in the Human Heart, an Angle is formed, which also has frequently got the name of Tuherculum Loweri.â€”This term, however, is more properly applied to the Projection in the Hearts of Brute Animals. Under this Angle or joining of the Venae Cavas, there is a superficial Depression, about the size of the point of the Finger, which is the Vestige of the Foramen Ovale, This, in a Foetus, forms a communication between the Right and Left Auricles, but in an Adult, is occupied by the original Valve, which now assists in forming the Fossa Ovalis. The Foramen Ovale is generally completely shut in an Adult, but sometimes a small aperture remains, at the upper part of the oval Fossa, and this has been more frequently detected in Female than in Male Subjects. The Fossa Ovalis has thick and strong edges, at its upper and fore part, called Columnce Foraminis Ovalis^ Isthmus ViEUssENii, vel Annulus Fossce Ovalis, At the left side of the Mouth of the Inferior Cava,

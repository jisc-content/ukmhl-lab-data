Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 285 Internally, they have a Villous appearance, and are formed of Cells which correspond with the irregularities on their external Surface, and communicate freely with each other.—Their shape, size, and general appearance, however, vary in diflFerent Subjects, and not unfre- quently in the opposite sides of the same person. Between the Vesiculse Seminales, the ends of the Vasa Deferentia now become larger and Cellular, pass forwards till they arrive at the Prostate Gland, where each Vas Deferens again contracts, joins the Vesicula of that side at a very sharp Angle, but communicates so freely with it, that injected Fluids readily pass from the former to the latter. From each Vesicula Seminalis and Vas Deferens of the same side, a common Canal, about a jinger'^s breadth in length, passes out, which is firmly connected to its fellow, without communicating with it, and, becoming gradually smaller, pierces obliquely the Prostate Gland, and terminates in the under and back part of the Neck of the Bladder, a little before the beginning of the Urethra. The Orifices of these Canals sometimes , open in a Lacuna, which is covered behind by a Valve, that has its conca-ve edge forwards ; but more generally they are separated from each other by a Caruncula, or round projection of the Membrane of the Urethra, termed Verumontanum, from its supposed resemblance to a Javelin of the Ancients ;—or Caput Gallinaginis, from its being broad behind, and rostriform before, and therefore compared to the Head and Beak of a Wood- cocJc. The Vesiculas Seminales are commonly considered as

They are covered by the Peritoneum, continued from the Surface of the Intestine, and are of the same struc^- ture and use with the Omentum. Besides the Appendiculae, there are on both sides of the adhesion of the Meso-colon to the Intestine, Adi- pose Strata, which are also of the same nature with the Omentum. The Colon is divided, longitudinally, into three parts, by as many Ligamentom-liJce Bands, which run upon its Surface. One of them goes along each side of the Colon; and that most exposed to view, when the Omentum is turn- ed up, is the largest: The third, which is the smallest, and which was discovered by Moegagni, is concealed by the attachment of the Meso-colon. They begin at the root of the Appendix Vermifor- mis, and, after running along the Caecum and Colon, they gradually unite into two, which afterwards spread uniformly over the Rectum. Mesentery. The Mesentery is formed by a doubling of the Peri- toneum, which is detached forwards, and includes the Intestines as in a Sling. It is named from its situation in the middle of the Intestines, and is divided into two parts, one connect- ing the Small Intestines, and retaining the name of Mesentery; the other, the Great Intestines, and term- ed MesO'Colon.

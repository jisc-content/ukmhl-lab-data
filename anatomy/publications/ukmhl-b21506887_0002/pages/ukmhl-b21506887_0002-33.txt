Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Si which are situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and two at the edges of the Foramina Lacera. Several other Processes pass out at the different openings of the Cranium, to be connected to the Pe- ricranium, or to accompany the Spinal Marrow and Nerves.—Those of the last description shall be after- wards taken notice of. The Arteries of the Dura Mater are derived chiefly from the External Carotids, and partly from the In- ternal Carotids and Vertebrals. The principal Branches of these Arteries run upon the outside of the Dura Mater, minute Filaments only being observed upon its inner Surface. The Veins of this Membrane are of two kinds. One set of them, like the Veins in other parts of the Body, accompany the Arteries;—the others are termed Si- nuses, and differ from Veins only in this, that their Transverse Sections are of a triangular figure, and that they are inclosed in a doubling of the Dura Mater, which is so tense over them, that they are little affect- ed by the pressure of the surrounding parts. In the bottom of the Sinuses are small Transverse Cords, termed ChordcE Willisii, which may add a little to their Strength, and assist in preventing them from being too much distended. The Sinuses serve to carry the Blood from the Brain, and convey it to the Veins of the Neck ; for which pur- pose they are properly fitted, their covering from the Dura Mater giving them strength, and their frequent communications preventing congestion.

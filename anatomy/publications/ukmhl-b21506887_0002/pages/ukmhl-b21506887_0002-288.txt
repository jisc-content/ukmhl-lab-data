238 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. are higher up, as to fall into Transverse Folds, which, however, disappear in proportion to the distension of the Intestine. The middle and under end of the Rectum has nu- merous large Mucous Qlands or Follicles. The Extremity of the Rectum forms a firm Circle, which acts as a Valve, and assists the proper Sphincter, in preventing the involuntary discharge of the Faeces. The Verge of the Anus is surrounded with deep Fol- licles, the contents of which prevent the tender Skin of the Anus from being excoriated by hard or acrid Fasces. The Anus is also surrounded with a great deal of Fat, which admits of the dilatation of the Rectum, and facilitates the discharge of the Faeces. The Rectum receives the Faeces from the Colon, re- tains them for a certain time, till, stimulated by their weight and acrid nature, it discharges them ; which it does by the power of its Muscular Coat, and that of the Levator Ani, assisted by the action of the Dia^ phragmatie and Abdominal Muscles. The Faeces, according to the late experiments of Berzelius, consist, in the 100 parts, of Water 7^.8, Vegetable and Animal Remains 7.0, Bile 0.9, Albumen 0.9, Peculiar and Extractive Matter 2.7, Salts 1.2, Slimy Matter, consisting of Picromel? Peculiar Ani- mal Matter, and insoluble residue, 14. The Blood-vessels of the Intestines are large and nu- merous, and are derived from different sources. The Duodenum receives Branches from the Splenic and Hepatic Arteries. The Jejunum, Ilium, and right half of the Colon, are supplied by the Superior Mesenteric Artery; and

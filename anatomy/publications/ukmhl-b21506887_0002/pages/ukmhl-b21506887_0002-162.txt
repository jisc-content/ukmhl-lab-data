1^0 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. When a Sapid Body is applied to the Papillae^ they are supposed to be erected, and thereby to render the sense of Taste more acute. In exercising this sense, the substance applied is dissolved in the Saliva, and Mie Tongue is then pressed against the Palate, the rough- ness of which renders the impression stronger. By being constantly moistened, the Papillae perform also the office of Touch more exquisitely than the dry Cutaneous Papilla of the other parts of the Body. Though the Tongue is the principal Organ of Taste, other parts, as the Palate, and even the Pha- rynx and Esophagus, possess this sense in a certain degree. Salivary Glands. The Salivary Glands consist of three large Glands on each side of the Face, viz.—the Parotid^ the Submaxil- lary^ and the Sublingual,—besides many small Glands named from the parts to which they belong. They are of a pale red and yellowish colour, and ir- regular on their Surface, being of the conglomerate kind. They are divided into Lobes, and each of these into minute Granulse. The Parotid Gland, which is the largest of the Sali- vary Glands, is named from its situation near the Ear. It occupies the whole space between the Ear, Mas- toid and Styloid Processes, and Angle of the Lower Jaw. It extends superiorly to the Zygoma, and anteriorly to the Masseter, part of which it covers, though by a thin expansion only.

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 247 creas, and approaches to the nature of an Artery in the thickness of its Coats, though it has no Pulsation. It passes to the Porta, where, from its great size, which is about three times that of the corresponding Artery, it is named Sinios VencB Portos^ and divides into Branches, which accompany those of the Artery in their course through the Substance of the Liver, terminating at last in the Pulpy Corpuscles. The Vena Portce serves to carry Venous Blood to the Liver, for the secretion of the Bile. It receives even the Blood which returns through the Veins of the Gall- Bladder, to assist in performing this Secretion. Some experiments seem to shew, that it may assist, in a small degree, in the nourishment of the Liver. The VencB Hepaticce are numerous. They are re- flected partly from the extremities of the Artery, and partly from those of the Vena Portae. They unite by degrees, and accompany the other two Sets of Vessels ; but, at the root of the Liver, they form two or three large Trunks which terminate in the Vena Cava, where it is about to perforate the Diaphragm. They like- wise send off some small Branches which terminate in the Cava, where that Vein lies behind the Liver. The Venae Hepaticae receive the Blood from the He- patic Artery and Vena Portae, after the Bile has been secreted, and return it to the Vena Cava, to be convey- ed by it to the Heart. The Vessels of the Liver communicate with each other in such a manner, that, after Death, a good In- jection may be made to pass from the Artery into the Vena Portae, the Venae Hepaticae, and Biliary Ducts, though into the last with difficulty.

The Absorbents of the Intestines are large and nu- merous.—They arise from the inner surface of the Canal, and run in the Mesentery and Meso-colon, passing through numerous Glands.—The Absorbents of the Small Intestines terminate in the Receptacle of the Chyle ; those of the Large Intestines go partly to the Thoracic Duct, and partly to the Lymphatics of the Loins.

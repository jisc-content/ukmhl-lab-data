COMPENDIUM OF ANATOxMY. [Part IV. Vertebras, going over the Aorta and Vena Cava, and under the superior Mesenteric Vessels. In passing across these Vessels, it ascends a little till it gets to the left side of the Spine; then, perforating the common root of the Mesentery and Meso-colon, it makes a turn forwards, and obtains the name of Jeju- num. The Jejunum, so named from its being commonly more empty than the other Intestines, in consequence of the thinner parts of its Contents being sooner ab- sorbed, begins at the last turn of the Duodenum, and forms numerous Convolutions, which run in all direc- tions, and are situated at the upper part of the Umbi- lical Region. The lUum, named from its numerous Turns, begins where the Jejunum terminates, or where the Internal Plicse become less conspicuous, and is distinguished ex- ternally from that Gut, by being smaller, thinner in its Coats, and paler, and from its forming about three- fifths of the length of the two Intestines. The Ilium, like the Jejunum, forms many Convolu- tions, which are situated on the under part of the Um- bilical Region, and extend as far as the Hypogastric and Iliac Regions, and not unfrequently, especially in Women, into the Cavity of the Pelvis. It surrounds the lateral parts of the Jejunum, and is supported by the Ossa Ilia ; and, the last turn of the Gut passing across towards the upper edge of the Right Os Ilium, it terminates by a Valve in the posterior and left side of the beginning of the Colon. Through the whole of this course, the Jejunum and Ilium are fixed to the Spine by a continuation of the

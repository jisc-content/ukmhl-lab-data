Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. IT OF THE BRAIN. The term Brain is applied to the whole of that Mass, which, with its surrounding Membranes, fills the Cavity of the Cranium ; and is larger in Man, in proportion to the Nerves belonging to it, than in any other Animal. The Brain is divided into Cerebrum, Cerebellum, Tuber Annulare, and Medulla Oblongata, the whole of which forming a Mass of about 48 or 50 ounces in weight, but the weight varying in diiFerent persons, according to the size of the Head. The Membranes of the Brain were called Meninges and Matres by the Ancients, from an idea that they gave birth to all the other Membranes of the Body. They consist of the Dura Mater, Tunica J^racJmot- dea, and Pia Mater. The Dura Mater, named from being of a firmer texture than the other two Membranes, incloses the Brain with all its Appendages, and lines the different parts of the Cranium. VOL. TI. B

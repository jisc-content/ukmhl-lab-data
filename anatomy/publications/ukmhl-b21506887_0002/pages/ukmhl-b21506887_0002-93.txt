65 Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Under the Striae and Processes of the Corpus Ciliare, the Retina is thinner than in the posterior part of the Eye, and is so compressed by these Bodies, as also to have the appearance of Striae terminating in numerous minute Fibres, like Nerves in other parts. The Retina is one of the most sensible parts of the Body. It is the seat of Vision, and therefore the pri- mary part of the Eye, to which all the others within the Orbit are subservient; but that portion which lies over the entrance of the Optic Nerve into the Ball of the Eye is insensible to light, and consequently does not contribute to Vision. HUMOURS. Aqueous Humouii. The Aqueous Humour is lodged in the space between the Cornea and Crystalline Lens. This space is divided into two Cavities, called Chain- hers; the anterior of which, by far the largest, is si- tuated between the Cornea and Iris. The posterior is placed between the Iris and Crys- talline Lens, and is so much smaller than the former, that its existence has been denied by some Authors, though it is a distinct Cavity, demonstrable, not only in an Adult, where the Pupil is open, but in a Foetus before the Pupil is formed. The Aqueous Humour is as clear as the purest water, but is somewhat heavier, possesses a small degree of viscidity, is about five grains in weight, and is found to be composed of water, albumen, gelatin, and muri- ate of soda.

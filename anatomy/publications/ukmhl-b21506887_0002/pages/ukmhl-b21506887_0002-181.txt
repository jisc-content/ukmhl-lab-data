Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 139 Jaw, the new Sacs lying between those of the Tempo- rary Teeth and the Internal Alveolar Plate, each be- ing on the inner side of the Tooth it is to succeed, and connected to the Gum.â€”-See Dr Blake's Thesis, Edin. 1798. The Sacs are at first contained in the same Sockets with the Temporary Teeth, and are loosely connected with the Membranes of these. During the growth of the Jaws, little Nitches are formed in the Internal Alveolar Plate, and these gra- dually form a distinct Socket round each of the Sacs of the Permanent Teeth. When the Temporary Teeth have advanced in their Sockets, the Sacs of the Permanent Teeth become elon- gated, biit still remain attached to the Sacs and Gums at the Necks of the Temporary Teeth, each by means of a Process which passes through a small Foramen at the inner edge of the Jaw. By degrees, as the Alveoli increase in size, the Per-^ manent Teeth get Sockets of their own. At the time of Birth, Ossification has commenced upon the tips of the Pulps of the anterior Permanent Molares, and there are small Membranous Sacs, con- taining the Pulps, with the Rudiments of the other two Molares. Ossification commences upon the points of their Pulps some time after, but always first in the Lower Jaw. In the formation of the second Permanent Molaris, a small Sac is sent back, which is at first contained in the same Socket with the Pulp of the First Molaris; a new Socket is afterwards formed, in which the Pulp of the Second Molaris becomes perfect; this, in. a similar

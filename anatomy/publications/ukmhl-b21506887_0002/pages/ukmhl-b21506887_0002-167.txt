Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &e. 1^5 Around the Surface, where the Body ends and the Root begins, the Tooth is a little contracted where it forms the Cervix or Collar of the Tooth. The Collar is connected to the Socket, and Gum which closely embracefs it; and which being destroyed, from what- ever cause, the Teeth are apt to drop out. The Roots are of a conical form, becoming gra- dually smaller as they recede from the Body of the Tooth, in consequence of which, pressure is removed from the tender parts placed at their points, and divid- ed equally over the Surface of the Fangs. The Roots are incrusted by a thin covering, of a yellowish tint, harder than the part it incloses, and sometimes called Horny Substance, Upon the Body of each Toothy there is an additional Covering, termed Cortex Striata^ or Enamel^ which is spread over all that part of the Tooth that, in the heal- thy state, appears beyond the Gums. The Enamel is of a white colour, insensible, and so hard, that a Saw or File impresses it with difficulty. The action of Fire does not much affect its colour. It is almost completely dissolved by Acids. It is thicker towards the cutting and grinding Sur- faces, and becomes gradually thinner towards the Cer- vix of the Tooth. It is composed of Fibres so disposed as to form Radii round the Body of the Tooth ; or they are nearly per- pendicular to its Surface. The Fibres are remarkably small and straight on the cutting Edges and grinding Surfaces of the Bodies, but curved at the sides of these, with the convex part turned towards the Fangs of the Teeth, which better

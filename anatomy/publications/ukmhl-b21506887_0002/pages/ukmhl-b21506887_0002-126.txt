9^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV, The Crura, like those of the Incus, are unequal in length, and have each a Groove on the inside, which gives insertion to the Membrane stretched between them. The Base is of an oval or rather semi-oval shape, and has no Perforation in it; its edges correspond with those of the Fenestra Ovalis, with which it is ar- ticulated. The Stapes is placed horizontally, being nearly at a right angle with the inferior Crus of the Incus. Its two Crura are placed in the same plane,â€”the longest backwards. The small Bones of the Ear are articulated with each other by Capsular Ligaments proportioned to their size, and are covered by Periosteum, which likewise fixes them to the Membrana Tympani, and Fenestra Ovalis. The small Bones have the following Muscles fixed to them, which serve for their different motions. Tensor Tympani, vel Internus MalleL Origin : From the Cartilaginous Extremity of the Eustachian Tube, near the entry of the Artery of the Dura Mater. From thence its Fleshy Belly runs backwards, in a Canal peculiar to it, at the upper and inner parts of the Osseous Portion of the Tube, being covered only by a thin Plate of Bone. It sends off a slender Tendon, which makes a turn in the Tympa- num, and passes outwards. Insertion: Into the inner and back part of the Handle of the Malleus, a little below the root of its long Process.

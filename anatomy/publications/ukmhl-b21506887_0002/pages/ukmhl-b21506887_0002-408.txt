832 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. Amnii, free from the pressureof the surrounding parts; —-and from many Dissections and Observations made by the latest Anatomists, it is ascertained that the Head preponderates, and in general continues undermost du- ring the whole time of Gestation. Formerly it was supposed that the Embryo, in the first Months, was situated with the Head uppermost, and that, in the later Months, the attitude of the Foe- tus was inverted. The Foetus, towards the end of Gestation, is observ- ed to be coiled up into an oval form, so as to be pro- perly adapted to the Cavity of the Uterus. The Head is bent towards the Thorax, and thp Arms are folded :—The Knees are drawn towards the Abdo- men, and the Heels towards the Nates. The Spine is bent into an Arch, and one side of the Body of the Foetus is frequently turned forwards. The Head is placed diagonally, with its long dia- meter corresponding to that of the Pelvis, and the Occiput opposed to the Os Tincae. Peculiarities of the Fcetus. All the Bones of the Foetus, excepting a few, are soft^ yielding^ and imperfect, and many of them entire- ly in a state of Cartilage, The Gelatin is observed to be in greater proportion than in Adults, in whom the Cartilage and Earthy Matter predominate. The Bones of a Foetus are uniform on their Sur- face, while those of an Adult are marked by the Mus- cles. Their Internal Cavities, at this period, are fill- ed with a Jelly, in place of Marrow. The Head is lar^e in proportion to the rest of the

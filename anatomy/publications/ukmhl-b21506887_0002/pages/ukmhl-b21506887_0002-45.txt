Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 33 IJcBnia Hippocampi, from being united with the great Hippocampus. The Body of the Fornix is narrow anteriorly, and becomes considerably broader behind, where it is incor- porated with the Corpus Callosum. The under Surface of the posterior part of the Body of the Fornix is impressed with numerous transverse and oblique Lines, which have been called Psalterium, or Lyra, from some resemblance they bear to the an- cient musical instruments of these names. The Body of the Fornix is joined above to the Sep- tum Lucidum; and below, it is connected to the Tha- lami Optici by a Vascular Membrane, called Tela Cho~ t'oidea, which spreads over the Thalami, and parts term- ed Tuhercula Quadrigemina and Pineal Gland. An- teriorly it unites with the Choroid Plexus of the Late- ral Ventricles; posteriorly it is continuous with the Pia Mater of the external part of the Brain. The Pedes Hippocampi, Cornua Ammonis, or Great Hippocampus,—-named from a supposed resemblance to these Bodies,—are tv»^o Medullary Eminences, which arise from the sides of the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum, and are situated in the inferior Pro- longations of the Lateral Ventricles. They run through the whole extent of these Pro- longations, first behind, then at the outer part of the posterior Pillars of the Fornix, and are so intimately connected with them, that they have been considered by some Authors as forming part of the Pillars them- selves. '^rhey are small at their origin, from which they con- tinue to increase to their farther extremity, VOL. II, c

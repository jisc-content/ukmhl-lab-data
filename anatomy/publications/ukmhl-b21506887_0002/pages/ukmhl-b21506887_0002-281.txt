Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. m At the upper and right side of the Sac, there is a Passage large enough to admit a Finger; this is the Foramen Winsloii. It is situated immediately behind the Cord of the Great Vessels which lead to the Liver, and is of a Se- micircular form. It is composed of the Peritoneum, under the appear- ance of two Ligaments which connect the surrounding parts to each other. The Foramen of Wins low maintains a communica- tion between the Large Sac of the Omentum and com- mon Cavity of the Abdomen; from which circumstance Fluids generated by disease may readily pass from one of these Cavities to the other. The Omentum, by its Fatty nature, serves to lubri- cate the Viscera, and to prevent them from being in- jured by Friction. Being suspended as a Curtain over the Intestines, it has also been supposed to retain the Heat that would otherwise escape from them; but a larga portion of the Intestines has no covering from this Substance. Structure of the Small Intestines in general. The Structure of the Small Intestines is nearly simi- lar to that of the Stomach, and the number of their Coats the same. The External Coat, excepting in a portion of the Duodenum, is ^ continuation of that part of the Peri- toneum which forms the Mesentery. It closely sur- rounds the Intestines, adhering to them by fine Cellu- lar Substance.

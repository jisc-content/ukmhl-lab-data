71 Part IV.J OF THE VISCERA, &c. Surface; excepting at its fore part, where it is impress^ ed by the Corpus Ciliare and Pigmentum Nigrum; but within, it sends Processes into the Body of the Humour, of the same nature with the external Membrane. Some Authors, and among these Winslow, have de- scribed this Coat as consisting of two Laminae; but Sa- BATiER, and other late Writers, seem sufficiently satis- fied that it is a single Layer; and even this single Layer cannot be raised but with difficulty, though it is demonstrable by making a puncture to allow the Humour to escape, and by afterwards distending the part with air. The structure of the Humour consists of a set of delicate Cells, which contain the Liquor within them, as may be seen by the assistance of Acids, or by boil- ing Water, or by Congelation. The Cells of the Humour communicate freelv with each other, as appears from the Liquor oozing out by the smallest puncture made in the general Capsule. Under the Corpus Ciliare, the Capsule of the Vitreous Humour sends off an external Lamina, which accom- panies the Retina, and is inserted with it into the fore part of the Capsule of the Lens, a little before its an- terior edge. It is termed Membranula Cor once Ciliaris, vel Zonula CUiaris^ from its striated appearance, and circular form. This Membrane, though extremely thin, assists in fixing the Lens to the Vitreous Humour. After sending off the Ciliary Zone, the Coat of the Vitreous Humour goes behind the Capsule of the Lens, with which it is intimately connected. Between the Ciliary Zone and part where the Cap- sule of the Vitreous Humour adheres to that of the

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. 45 The Firsts or Olfactory Pair of Nerves, arise from the back part of the Anterior Lobes of the Brain, and run towards the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone, where each forms a brownish-coloured Bulb, from which numerous small Nerves are sent off. The Second Pair, or Optic Nerves, are the continua- tion of the Thalami Optici. They are united imme- diately under the Infundibulum, and form what has been called the Union, the Decussatio?i, or the Commis- sure of the Optic Nerves. Here there is an intimate intermixture of parts, and the Nerves again separate, previously to their passing into the Orbits. The Third Pair arise from the Crura Cerebri by numerous Threads, which are soon collected into Trunks. The Fourth Pair, which are the smallest Nerves of the Body, arise behind the Testes, and have a long winding course. The Fifth Pair, which are the largest Nerves in the Brain, have each an anterior small, and a posterior large Fasciculus, arising from the sides of the Tuber Annulare. The Sixth Pair arise from the beginning of the Me- dulla Oblongata, where it joins the Tuber Annulare. Each of the Nerves of this Pair has a small Thread at its inner part. The Seventh Pair arise from the beginning of the lateral parts of the Medulla Oblongata, and are divid- ed on each side into a Portio Mollis and Portio Dura. The Eighth Pair arise by small Fasciculi from the Corpora Olivaria.

39 Part IY.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. Subjects, but are easily distinguished from the direc- tion of their Convolutions. The Substance of the Cerebellum consists of Cineri- tious and Medullary Matter, as in the Cerebrum; but the Cineritious bears a greater proportion to the Me- dullary in the former than in the latter. When the Cerebellum is cut in a longitudinal Ver- tical direction through its middle, the Medullary part is then found to bear a striking resemblance to the branching of the Shrub called Arbor Vitce: from which circumstance it has obtained the name of that Shrub. When cut in slices nearly parallel to the base of the Brain, the Medullary Substance appears in Laminae corresponding to those of the Surface of the Cerebel- lum ; and when cut to a considerable depth, or when the Laminae are removed, there is, as in the Cerebrum, a Centrum Medullare, somewhat]of the form of the en- tire Cerebellum, consisting of a middle and two lateral portions. If the Cerebellum be cut vertically a little from its middle, and the incision carried forwards and inwards, as far as the Tuber Annulare, a small quantity of Ci- neritious Substance is seen, with an indented border, which partially incloses a quantity of Medullary Mat- ter, and has got the name of Corpus Dentatum, vel Rhomboideum. This Substance is found to be the on- ly Cineritious part in the Centrum Medullare. Between the Cerebellum, the under and back part of the Tuber Annulare, and upper and back part of the Medulla Oblongata, the Fourth Ventricle is situated, which extends from the Testes to the posterior-inferior Notch of the Cerebellum formed by the Falx Minor.

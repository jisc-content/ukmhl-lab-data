130 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. anterior or posterior Surfaces. Each has a single Fang, which, in the Upper Jaw, is the longest of any, excepting those of the Canine Teeth. Their Enamel is thicker on their anterior and poste- rior Surfaces than at the sides, where it is remarkably thin, and thicker before than on the back part of the Tooth. The middle Incisores of the Upper Jaw are broader and longer than the lateral ones, and these larger than the Incisores of the Under Jaw, the lateral of which are larger than the middle set. The Incisores of the Upper Jaw overlap those in the Under one when the Molares are worn down, and act then like Scissars. In this state the Incisores of one Jaw frequently press the Gums from the roots of those of the opposite Jaw, so as to loosen the Teeth in their Sockets. The Cuspidatiy vel Canini, are placed at the sides of the Incisores, are larger than these, and, like them, have their Bases in form of Wedges, but pointed in the middle. The Enamel covers more of these than of the Inciso- res, and is more equal in thickness all around the Teeth. The Fangs are thicker, larger, and more depressed at the sides, than those of the Incisores, and appear broadest when viewed in a lateral direction. The Roots of the Canini are the longest of any, and being also the largest, they project more in the Jaw, as is obvious both to the sight and touch; hence the Inci- sores and Canini are almost in a straight line, especial- ly in the U nder Jaw. The Canini have each common- ly but one long root, which is crooked at the point. In

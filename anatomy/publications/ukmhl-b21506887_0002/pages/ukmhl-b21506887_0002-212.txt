164 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. of the milk is prevented, unless it be accumulated in so large a quantity as to extend them. But when the Nipple is drawn out and extended,— as by the application of the Child'^s Mouth,—the Ducts become straight and parallel to each other, so as to al- low an uninterrupted flow of Milk. After Sucking, the Nipple, and consequently it& Ducts, immediately recover their former situation. Sometimes one or more of the Lactiferous Ducts ter- minate upon the Surface of the Areola, from which MoRGAGNi supposed that the Glands there were of the Lactiferous kind. In Children the Mammae are merely Cutaneous Tu- bercles, but at the time of Birth they are large in pro- portion, and in both Sexes contain a Milky-like MucuSy which can be readily squeezed out. This Fluid commonly disappears a short time after Birth;—but there are various examples on record, where Milk has been brought to the Breasts, both of young Girls and old Women, by the frequent application of a Child to the Nipple, and where there was no cause for suspecting this to be the consequence of Impregnation. Nor are instances wanting of Milk having been brought to the Mammillae of Men by the same application.

The secretion of the Milk begins a little before De- livery, but increases more rapidly soon after it; and continues to flow for many months, and even for some years, if the Woman suckle her child; and the more

Part IV.] OF THE VISCERA, &c. S3 IcR Pacchioni. They are of a whitish colour, scarcely so large as Mustard Seeds, and commonly joined in clusters. The nature of these Granulations is still unknown. â€”-By some they have been supposed to belong to the Lymphatic System. The Tunica Arachnoidea, named from its cob- web appearance, is an exceedingly thin, tender, and transparent Membrane, in which no Vessels have been hitherto observed. It is spread uniformly over the Surface of the Brain, inclosing all its Convolutions, without insinuating itself between any of them. At the upper part of the Brain, it adheres so closely to the subjacent Coat by fine Cellular Substance, that it can scarcely be separated from it; but in different parts of the Base of the Brain, particularly about the Tuber Annulare and Medulla Oblongata, it is merely in con- tact with the Pia Mater, and may readily be raised from it by the assistance of a Blow-pipe. The Tunica Arachnoidea, like the Cuticle, covers and defends the parts under it. The Pia Mater, named from its tenderness, is somewhat of the nature of the former Covering, but is extremely vascular. It varies in thickness and strength in different parts of the Brain, according to the num- ber of Vessels dispersed on it. It envelopes the Brain in general, enters double be- tween all its convolutions, connecting Hemispheres, Lobes, and Convolutions together, and lines the diffe- rent Cavities called Ventrkles.

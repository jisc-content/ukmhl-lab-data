254 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part IV. The Spleen has frequently deep Fissures upon its edges ;â€”sometimes it has small Appendages attached to it, and not unfrequently there is one or more Spleens^ though very small, connected with it. At the inner side, it is fixed to the Omentum, and by means of that and Blood-vessels, to the Stomach and Pancreas. Behind, it is connected to the Diaphragm, and below, to the Left Kidney and Colon, by Reflec- tions of the Peritoneum, and by Cellular Substance. It is covered by a double Membrane., one Layer of which is a production of the Peritoneum, the other proper to the Spleen itself, but so closely connected to the Common Coat, that they appear in the Adult Body to be one and the same Membrane. The Substance of the Spleen is remarkably soft, and is by much the most tender of the Abdominal Viscera. It consists of a Congeries of Blood-vessels, Lympha- tics, and Nerves, joined together and supported by a large quantity of Cellular Substance. The extreme Branches of the Blood-vessels put on the appearance of Penicilli, which have been mistaken for Glands. These Vessels are so tender, that when an injection is forcibly thrown either into Artery or Vein, particu- larly the latter, it bursts into the common Cellular Substance, and gives the appearance of Follicles or Cells; and such were described by Malpighi as ex- isting naturally between the extremities of the Artery, and beginnings of the Veins. The Blood-vessels of the Spleen are among the largest

I speak not of thy Soul, but of thy Body oulv. j I i The Skeleton is a complete framework of bones (A); the Skidl is nicely balanced, and rests upon the Sinne, which is a bony column, forming the back, and giving to the figure strength and upright posture. The Bibs are rooted in the spine, and act as bars to keep the wonderful machinery within from injury. In the thighs, legs, arms, and hands, bones, for purposes of strength, are well jointed into one another; oi’, where easy movement is required, they are fitted into .sockets.

Their attachment to the walls of the tympanum is effected chiefly by the following ligaments, as well as by the reflections of the mucous membrane lining that cavity. 6 The anterior ligament of the malleus (figs. 90, I a, and 101, I. a m) is a comparatively strong and broad band of fibres, which connects the base of the processus gracilis and the anterior part of the malleus above this process with the anterior wall of the tympanum close to the Glaserian fissure. The part of the ligament which passes out of the Glaserian fissure was long thought to be muscular (laxator tympani auct.), but most observers agree in denying the

The number from both divisions of the gland seldom exceeds twelve. After running obliquely under the mucous membrane, and separating at the same time from each other, they open in a row at the fornix con- junotivra, by separate orifices, at its upper outer part. Structure—The lachrymal gland is a compound, tubulo-racemose gland lesembhng the serous salivary glands in general structure. Its alveoli are bounded Fig. 8.—Alveoli of the lachhymal gland of the sog^~A vpn« a n,.„T <n.!s5 tost- ™- - - — by a basement membrane formed of ramified flattened eells , and the secretin* cells esidnt changes ,n the different states of rest and activity of the gland simflaTUo Fig. 9.—Front of the left eyelids with the lachry- mal CANALS AND NASAL DDCT EXPOSED. 1, 1, upper and lower lachrymal canals, showing towards the eyelids the narrow 1 ent portions and the puncta lacri- niaha; 2, lachrymal sac; 3, the lower part of the nasal duct; 4, plica semilunaris ; 5, caruncula lacrimalis. those seen in most other glands (see fig. 8 and 7ol. I., Part 2, p. 396). No rod-like structure has been noticed in the epithelium of the ducts. The arteries of the gland are derivedlfrom the lachry- mal, and the veins pass into the ophthalmic vein. The nerves come from the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic and from the sympathetic. Lachrymal canals.—These commence as , . already mentioned by a minute aperture (punc- tum) on the margin of each lid, near the inner angle (figs. 9, 10 and 11) The upper punctum is slightly smaller and is situated rather more mesially than the lower one Ihe upper canal is rather the smaller and longer of the two • it

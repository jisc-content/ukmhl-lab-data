73 STRUCTURE OF THE PINNA. the concave side Iu the external auditory meatus these reappear in a modified form as the ceruminous glands. The hairs of the pinna are most numerous and louo-est on the tragus and antitragus. The hairs on the margin and convex aspect of the ear are arranged with a general tendency to point towards the tubercle ot Darwin where the converging series may even form a distinct tuft, thus furnishmg an additional argument in favour of the view regarding the meaning of that promi- nence which was taken by Darwin. crus helicis _ helix fossa scaphoidea _J spina helicis ~ anthelix - free edge of tragus J incisura Santorini tragus plate — end of cartilage of meatus 1, Fig. 80.—Ear-cartilage, anterior aspect.

The cartilage is not confined to the pinna, but enters likewise into the construction of the outer part of the external auditory canal. When dissected from other structures, it is i

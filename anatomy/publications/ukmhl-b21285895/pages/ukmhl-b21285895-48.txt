MICEOSCOPIC STEUCTUBE OF THE EETINA. When vertical sections of the retina, i.e., sections made perpendicularly to its surface, are submitted to microscopic examination, eight distincc strata are recog- nizable, together with certain fibrous structures which pass vertically throuo-h the membrane and connect the several layers. The^following are the designations of the layers, from within outwards :— 1. The layer of nerve-fibres (stratum opticum). 2. The layer of nerve-cells {ganglion nervi optici). 3. The inner molecular layer {stratum reticulare internum). 4. The inner nuclear layer {stratum granularum internum, ganglion relitue). 5. The outer molecular layer (stratum reticulare externum). 6. The outer nuclear layer (stratum granularum externum). 7. The layer of rods and cones (stratum bacillorum). 8. The layer of hexagonal pigment cells (stratum nigrum). In addition to these eight strata two very delicate membranes have been described—the one, memlrana limitans interna, bounding the retina on its inner surface, next to the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour; the other, membrana

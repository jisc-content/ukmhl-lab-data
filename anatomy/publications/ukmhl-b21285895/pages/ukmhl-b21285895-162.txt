150 THE ORGANS OP TASTE. Taste-buds have been compared in general form and appearance to the leaf-buds of a plant. They are flask-shaped bodies, the base of the flask resting upon the corium of the mucous membrane and the apex projecting towards the free surface of the epithelium, and emerging between the ordinary flattened surface- Fig. 171.—Section through one of the taste-buds of the papilla foliata of the kabbit.

The cells of the stratified epithelium are adapted and applied to the outer surface of the taste-bud and form a sort of adventitious capsule for it. The most superficial cells may even be perforated to allow of the access of the apex of the taste-bud to the free surface. In any case the apex does not quite reach the surface, but is approached from the surface by a small opeuing, the gustatory pore. Into this a bunch of fine hairlets, prolonged from the gustatory cells of the taste-bud, is seen to project. Every taste-bud contains two kinds of cells termed respectively the sustentacular and the gustatory cells. The sustentacular cells (fig. 172, b) are long and spindle-shaped, tapering to either end. They form a complete envelope to the taste-bud, being fitted together like the staves of a barrel: these surface cells are flattened from within out. Other sustentacular cells lie within the taste-bud amongst the gustatory cells, extending from apex to base of the taste-bud. The gustatory cells (fig. 172, a) closely resemble in general appearance the olfactory cells of Max Schultze (see p. 141).

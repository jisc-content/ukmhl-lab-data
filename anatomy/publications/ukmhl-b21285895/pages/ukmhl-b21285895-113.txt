Opposite the lamina spiralis at the commencement or base of the cochlear tube is another bony lamina (secondary spiral lamina) which nearly meets the spiral lamina, so that there is here only a narrow cleft between the two. The lamina is dense at its free edge ; but nearer the modiolus its internal

(Retzius.) spiral lamina in front of the floor of the vestibule. Near to this blind extremity the canal of the cochlea receives a small canal, lined with epithe- lium, canalis reiiniens (Hen- sen), which is continued from the saccule of the vestibule like a neck of a flask, and enters the canal of the cochlea abruptly nearly at a right angle (figs. 117, 118, 19). The cavity of the canal of the cochlea is thus rendered continuous with that of the saccule. The structures which are found upon the floor of this spirally-wound triangular canal of the cochlea claim more particular attention, for it is to them that the branches of the cochlear nerve are distributed, and upon them the function of the cochlea as a part of the auditory apparatus appears more especially dependent. 1 In monotremes and in birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes, there is a specially modified patch of auditory epithelium at the lagena, similar to the maculae of utricle and saccule, and provided with otoliths. In fishes this is the only nerve-terminal apparatus in the cochlea, which is also otherwise quite rudimentary. lagena hamulus bundles of cochlear nerve organ of Corti.

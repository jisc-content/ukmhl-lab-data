14 THE EY K. Sr. Fig. 15.—Diagram op the bight adult human eye, divided nearly horizontally through the middle. (E. A. S.) Magnified fire times. The line a b passes through the equator, x y through the visual axis of the eye. The figure has been drawn, as far as possible, to scale, the following- being taken as the average measurements of the parts of the adult eye in millimeters :— Transverse diameter of the eyeball ......... 24-.r» Vertical diameter ............. 23*5 Antero-posterior diameter ........... 24*0 Greatest thickness of the sclerotic, choroid, and retina together . . . . T4 Greatest thickness of the sclerotic posteriorly ........ 0'8 Thickness of the sclerotic at the equator ... .... . . 0'4 Thickness of the cornea in the centre ......... 0-8 Distance from the middle of the anterior surface of the cornea to the front of the lens . 3-4 Antero-posterior diameter of tho lens -TO'

145 BLOOD-VESSELS AXD LYMPHATICS. The veins form a dense plexus in the mucous membrane,'those in the deeper parts of the membrane being especially large and closely arranged so as almost to approach the structure of a cavernous tissue. This is most largely developed over the whole lower fcurbinal, the lower and hinder border of the middle turbiual, and the hinder end of the upper turbinal as well as on the lower and hinder part of the septum. A similar dense venous plexus, continuous with that of the nasal fosste, extends around the nasal duct, as far upwards as the lachrymal sac. The trunk's leaving the cavity accompany the arteries, the spfieno-palatine vein emptying septal branch of ant. ethmoidal communicating branch between post, nasal and post, ethmoidal naso-palatinc artery branches of post, nasal for the inf. meatus ; post, nasal artery i i branch for inferior concha Fig. 165.â€”Arterial supply to the mucous membrane op the laterat, wall op the nasal fossa. (After Zuckerkandl.) itself into the pterygoid plexus; the ethmoidal veins joining the ophthalmic vein and the veins of the dura mater, and also sending a branch to join the veins of the orbital part of the frontal lobe of the brain (Zuckerkandl), and small veins passing out at the margin of the nares. to join the venous plexus of the upper lip. Some small veins also pierce the nasal bone and the ascending process of the superior maxilla to join the commencement of the facial vein. The lymphatics are abundant and large. They form a close plexus in the mucous membrane, the branches extending almost to the surface, and a more open plexus of valved vessels nearer the bone. These are in communication with the lymphatic spaces which enclose the branches of the olfactory nerve, and these spaces again communicate with the subdural and subarachnoid spaces of the cranium, so that the lymphatics of the nasal mucous membrane can be injected from the cranial VOL.

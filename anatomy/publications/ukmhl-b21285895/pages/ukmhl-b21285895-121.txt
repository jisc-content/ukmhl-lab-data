VESSELS OF THE LABYRINTH. Ill rounded extremity. They are surrounded by the branching axis-cylinders of the nerve-fibres which penetrate into the epithelium ; the medullary sheath disappears Fig. 123.â€”Longitudinal section op an ampulla through the crista acustica. Semi-diagrammatic (E.A.S.). "amp, cavity of the ampulla; sc. c, semicircular canal opening out of it; c. connective tissue attached to the wall of the membranous ampulla and traversing the perilymph ; e e, flattened epithelium of ampulla; h, auditory hairs projecting from the columnar cells of the auditory epithelium into the cupula, cup. term. ; v, limit of the auditory epithelium on the crista ; n, nerve-fibres entering the base of the crista and passing into the columnar cells. as the fibres enter the epithelial layer, and the axis-cylinders ramify amongst the cells, but there does not appear to be any actual continuity between the terminal arborizations of the nerve fibres (fig. 125) and the hair-cells. Fig. 124. Section oi the macula acustica of the recessus utkiculi, human. (Gr. Retzius.) Magnified. n.vir., bundles of the utricular branch of the eighth nerve; h, hair-cells ; p.l.s., perilymphatic space. Between and beneath the columnar cells other cells are met with of a different character. They take the form of long and comparatively rigid fibres (fibre-cells of Eetzius) which extend through the whole thickness of the epithelium, and are pro- vided at one part of their course with a nucleated enlargement. This is always

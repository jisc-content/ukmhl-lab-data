Those differences are well exemplified by comparing fig. 153, which represents the lateral wall of the left nasal fossa in the macerated condition with fig. 154, which shows the right nasal fossa as it appears when still covered by mncous membrane. In (coronal) section each nasal fossa is irregularly triangular in shape, the apex of the triangle being formed by the roof of the fossa, and the base by the floor. Towards the apex the triangle is quite narrow, but about halfway towards its base, i.e., immediately below the free edge of the middle turbinal (see below), each fossa expands, so that this lower part is nearly quadri- lateral in coronal section (fig. 150) ; this is the respiratory part.- the upper narrow part is the olfactory part of the fossa or olfactory cleft. The mesial wall and floor of each fossa is smooth, but the lateral wall is complicated by a series of lamellar Fig. 153.—View of the lateral wall op the left nasal fossa as it appears in the macerated skeleton. (Modified from Arnold.) prominences running in a sagittal direction and projecting into the cavity ; these prominences, which are formed by the turbinate processes of the ethmoid bone and by the inferior turbinate bone covered by mucous membrane, may be termed the turbinate bodies, or simply turbinals (concha). The following: are the average dimensions of the nasal fossa} (Thane) :— Greatest vertical measurement (at fore part of cribriform plate) . . 44 mm. Greatest sagittal measurement (along floor, from posterior margin of hard palate to anterior extremity of roof) 73 mm. Sagittal measurement of osseous part of floor . . . . .44 mm.

THE CHOROID COAT. 25 free from pigment-cells ; and lymphoid cells may occur in it here and there singly or in groups (fig. 28). It is loosely united to the lamina fusca by vessels and bands of connective tissue enclosing pigment-cells, and the two laminae as well as the Fig. 28.—A small portion of lamina supka-choroidka. Highly magnified. (E. A. S.) p, pigment-cells ; /, elastic fibres ; n, nuclei of epithelioid cells (the outlines of the cells are not indicated) ; I, lymphoid cells. uniting structures are coated with endothelium, a lymph-space being thus formed between the sclerotic and choroid. This space communicates, at the places where the vessels and nerves pierce the sclerotic, with that of the capsule of Tenon (Schwalbe). The choroid proper resembles in general structure the lamina suprachoroidea, hut contains in addition a very large number of blood-vessels. From a difference in the fineness of these constituent vessels, it resolves itself into two strata, outer and Fig. 29.—Section of choroid. (Cadiat.) a, membrane of Bruch : the chorio-capillaris is just above it ; b, vascular layer ; c. vein with blood- corpuscles ; d, lamina suprachoroidea. inner ; the former containing the larger branches, and the latter the capillary ramifications. A layer of connective tissue containing many elastic fibres which unites the two strata, and is nearly free from pigment, is sometimes described as a third or intermediate part. Tapetum.—This intermediate layer is markedly fibrous in some mammals, and shines through the layer of choroid and retina in front of it, causing the appearance known as the tapetum. In other mammals and in fish the appearance of a tapetum is produced or

Some of the nerve-fibres appear to end here by ramifying with a spiral course amongst the bases of the inner hair-cells, but others are continued as fine threads between the inner rods, and form a second spiral band close to the outer- side of these and in contact with the protoplasmic cell which ensheaths them. Other fibres may be seen in sections to pass across the tunnel of Corti between the rods and to enter the region of the outer hair-cells. Here the fibres, which now again branch and alter their direc- tion, run spirally parallel with the successive series of hair-cells. They rest against the corresponding cells of Deiters, and in man form a bunch of spirally-running fibres immediately below the expanded part of each hair-cell (fig. 145). They form, therefore, altogether five or six spiral strands of fibrils, which lie between the epithelium-cells of the organ

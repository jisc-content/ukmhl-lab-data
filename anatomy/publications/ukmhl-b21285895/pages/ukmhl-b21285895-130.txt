118 THE EAR. The membrane of Reissner (fig. 129, 131, R), separates the scala vestibuli from the banal of the cochlea. It is composed of an exceedingly delicate layer of connective tissue continuous with the lining periosteum of the scala vestibuli, and is covered on the surface, which is turned to the cochlear canal with a simple pavement epithelium which is in continuity below with the epithelium of the limbus and above with that lining the outer wall of the canal. The cells have each a circular flattened nucleus, and not unfrequently contain fat-droplets. The vestibular side of the membrane of Reissner is quite smooth, and is covered with an epithelial layer of flattened connective-tissue cells, distinguishable from the epithelial cells on the other side by their greater delicacyof outline,and their larger size. A few blood-capillaries are continued into the adjacent part of the membrane from the neighbouring periosteum. Outer wall of the cochlear canal.—The periosteum which lines the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, consists of ordinary connective tissue.

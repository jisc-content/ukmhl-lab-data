TASTE-BUDS. papilla foliata (fig. 16!)). Taste-buds are also found over the anterior surface of the soft palate, and are very numerous over the posterior surface of the epiglottis.

In amphibia the taste-organs take the form of patches Fig. 170.—Vertical section of a foliate papilla of the rabbit, passing across the folia.

The structure of the taste-buds is most easily studied in sections of the papilla foliata of the rabbit (figs. 170, 171).

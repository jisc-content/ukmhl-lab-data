Here the bundles are closely arranged, but further from the margin ihey are more separated, and form less complete rings. The dilator (b), less apparent than the sphincter, begins at the ciliary or outer margin of the iris, and its fibres form a continuous membrane close to the posterior surface, converging towards the pupil. Here they bend round and blend with the sphincter, some reaching nearly to its inner margin. At their origin at the ciliary margin, they also arch round and take a somewhat circular direction. The majority of recent writers on the subject have failed to find evidence of the existence of a distinct layer of dilatator fibres and have consequently denied its existence in man and )

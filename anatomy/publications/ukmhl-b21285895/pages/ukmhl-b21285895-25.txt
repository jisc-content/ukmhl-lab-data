The outer fibj m* ;heath of the nerve blends with the sclerotic at the margin of the aperture : in consequence of this arrangement, when the nerve is cut off close to the eyeball, the funiculi seem to enter by a group of pores; and to the part of the sclerotic thus perforated the name of lamina cribrosa is given. Around this cribrous opening are smaller apertures for the posterior ciliary arteries and the ciliary nerves. These are disposed in the manner.shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 16). Nearer the equator of the globe the sclerotic is pierced by four apertures which transmit veins (vense vorticose).

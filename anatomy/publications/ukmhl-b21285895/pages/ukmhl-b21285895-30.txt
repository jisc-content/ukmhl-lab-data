A 1 A chamber with an en- dothelium (fig. 19, 5), which resembles that on serous membranes, con- sisting of a single layer of flattened polygonal cells with distinct nuclei. These cells are fibrillar in structure, being tra- versed by bundles of fine fibrils which pass from cell to cell across the intercellular spaces (fig. 21), and are probably formed by threads of protoplasm, for they undergo rapid alteration, and very soon disappear after death or removal of the globe. (Nuel, Smirnow.) Near its circumference the membrane breaks up into bundles of fibres, which give attachment to the ciliary muscle (see fig. 22), but a few fine fibres are continued into the substance of the iris, around the angle of the anterior chamber. To these radiating and anastomosing bundles of elastic fibres prolonged from the circum-

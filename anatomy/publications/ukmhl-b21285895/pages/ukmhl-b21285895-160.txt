I b8 THE ORGANS OF TASTE. THE OKGANS OF TASTE. The gustatory organs arc represented by certain patches or groups of peculiarly modified epithelium cells which are lodged in the thickness of the stratified epithe- lium of certain parts of the tongue and pharynx. These groups of cells have in mammals a bud-like arrangement and have therefore been termed luslc-hnils. Thev occur in man at the sides of the papillae vallatte of the tongue, forming a zone around the papillaa and also upon the opposed wall of the vallum. They are also found on Fig. 167.—Papillary surface of the tongue, with the fauces anu tonsils. (Sappey.) 1, 2 circumvallate papillae ; 3, fungiform papilla? ; 4, 5, filiform and conical papillae ■ 6 elands and glandular recesses ; 7, tonsils ; 8, tip of the epiglottis ; 9, fanum epiglottic^. 1 ' » * the fungiform papilla of the back and sides of the tongue, extending to the lip and here and there in the epithelium covering the general surface of the same parts of that organ. They are especially numerous over a small area just in front of the anterior pillar of the fauces {fimbria lingvm). This area usually displays four or nve longitudinal folds or elevatious of the mucous membrane and appears to represent a much better defined oval laminated structure which is found in a similar situation in the tongue of some mammals {e.g., rabbit), and which is known as the

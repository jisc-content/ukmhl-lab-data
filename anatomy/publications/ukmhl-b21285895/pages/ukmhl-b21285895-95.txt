85 THE TYMPANUM. mastoid cells are very variable in development: when large they approach aUjeto the free surface of. the bone, and may come into proximity with the lateial sinus, when small there is a considerable thickness of bone between them and the surface. Sometimes they are undeveloped, and their place is occupied by spongy bony substance (diploe). At the lower margin of the orifice of the antrum is a depressed surface for the attachment of the lower ligament of the incus.

A. b.) 1 tympanic crest ; 2, entrance to mastoid cells ; 3, mastoid antrum ; 4, prominence due to external semicircular canal ; 5, prominence over aqueduct of Fallopius (a bristle, 13,13, has been passed through this canal); 6, fenestra ovalis ; 7, pyramid ; 8, posterior sinus ; 9, sinus tympam ; 10, styloid protu- berance : li.subiculum promontorii ; 12, fenestra rotunda ; U, bristle passed through the canal for the tympanic nerve ; 15, jugular fossa ; 16, tympanic cells ; 17, canal for Eustachian tube ; 18.P™montory, 19 20, 21, grooves for nerves on promontory emerging from the end of the canal for the tympanic nerve, 19 being for the caroticotympanic, 20 for the small deep petrosal, and 21 for the small super- ficial petrosal; 22, trochlear end of the canal for the tensor tympani muscle ; 23, bridge of bone uniting the promontory with the pyramid. Below the orifice of the antrum and behind the fenestra ovalis is a small conical eminence (1 m. to 1*5 m. high), called the pyramid, or eminmtia papillaris (fig. 90, py ; fig. 93, 7). Its apex is pierced by a foramen, through which the tendon of the stapedius muscle emerges. The muscle is contained within a canal

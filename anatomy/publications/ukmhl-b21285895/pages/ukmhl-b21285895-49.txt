MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THE RETINA. 39 limitans externa, lying between the outer nuclear layer and the layer of rods and cones • but, as will be afterwards explained, these so-called " membranes are merely the boundary lines of the sustentacular tissue of the retina. The accompanying fio-nre from Max Schultze, represents diagrammatically the general arrangement of the layers (fig. 48). ...in The several layers of the retina will first be considered successively as they are met with from within out, after which the sustentacular fibres or fibres of Miiller, which traverse several of the layers, and the connection of the nervous elements Outer or choroidal surface. 8.

Finally an account will be given of those parts of the retina which pressnt points of difference from the rest, especially the central fovea, and the ciliary part. 1 Layer of nerve-fibres.—The optic nerve passes at the porus opticus directly through the thickness of the retina to reach its inner surface (fig. 47) on which it spreads out in the form of a membrane which extends to the ora serrata. Its fibres, which are destitute of a primitive sheath and vary much m size, but are mostly small, lose their medullary sheath on reaching the retina consisting there normally of axis-cylinder only (Bowman). In rare cases some of them may retain their medullary sheath for a short distance. They are collected

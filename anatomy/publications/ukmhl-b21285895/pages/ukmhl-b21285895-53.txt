43 INNER NUCLEAR LAYER OF THE RETINA. fibrils. It is regarded as the axis-cylinder process of the cell, and extends usually to the inner part of the internal molecular layer, within which it ends in a terminal ramification of varicose fibrils which is frequently in close proximity to the outer surface of one or more of the ganglion-cells of the layer. The outer prolongation or process of the bipolar cell is not varicose, is usually thicker than the inner one, and in some cases passes undivided into the next layer, in others divides before reaching it. Having arrived at the outer molecular layer it breaks up into an arborisation within this layer, which is interlaced with arborisations of fibres belonging to the horizontal cells presently to be described, and with the termina- tions "of the rod- and cone-elements of the bacillary layer. It has been shown by R. y Cajal that the bipolars are of at least two kinds, distinguishable by the character of the terminal arborescence of the outwardly-directed protoplasmic Fig. 50.â€”Elements op the ketina of mammals displayed by the chromate op silver method of Golgi.

In one kind this arborescence is composed of a dendritic tuft of vertical fibrils, somewhat varicose and enclosing amongst them the end-knobs of several (3 to 20) of the rod-fibres of the bacillary layer ; and the axis- cylinder process ends in a varicose ramification over a body of a cell of the ganglionic layer. These may be termed, therefore, the rod-Mpolars, or bipolars with vertical arborescence (fig. 50, I., c ; in., a). In the other kind (cone-bipolars) this terminal arborescence is horizontal (fig. 50, I., e ; in., b, c, d, e), and abuts against or interlaces with the ramified foot of one or more cone-fibres, and the axis-cylinder process usually extends to a less depth of the internal molecular layer, and is not constant in position as is that of the rod-bipolar ; the axis-cylinder process of either kind may give off short collaterals in traversing the inner molecular layer.

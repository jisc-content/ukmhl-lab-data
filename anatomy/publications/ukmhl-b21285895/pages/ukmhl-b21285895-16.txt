0 THE EYE. branches from the Meibo- mian glands and from the orbicularis and integument, below which it forms a tortuous venous plexus, with large and irregular meshes. Fig. 6. — Section op the upper EYELID, WITH THE ARTERIES injhcted. (Modified from Merkel.) The course of the nervous twigs is also shown. The blood from this plexus passes externally into the superficial tamporal and in- ternally into the facial vein. Lymphatics.—There are two networks of lymphatic vessels in each eyelid, one in front of, the other behind the tarsus. The former re- ceives lymph from the in- tegumental and muscular structures of the lid, the latter from the Meibomian glands and conjunctiva. The networks are connected by vessels which pierce the tarsi, but less freely in the lower than in the upper eyelid. The efferent lymphatics find their way mesially along the in the lower lid. The two arches in the upper lid are joined here and there by small anastomotic arteries. Branches pass in each lid from the tarsal arches, 1, for- Fig. 5.— Plan op the ophthalmic artery, show- ing THE TYPICAL MODE OP ORIGIN OK ITS branches. (G. D. T. after Meyer.) wards to supply the orbicularis muscle, and the in tegumental structures ; 2, backwards into the tarsus to supply the Meibomian glands; and 3, backwards around the upper and lower edges of the tarsus to supply the conjunctiva palpebrarum. The veins of the eyelids are disposed in two series or networks. The one, post-tarsal, receives branches from the conjunctiva and a few from the Meibomian glands ; its blood passes for the most part into the ophthal- mic vein. The other, or pre-tarsal, receives

OF THE SKELETON. 254 Part I. the I lefs. The little toe, and frequently that next to it, have the fecond and third bones intimately united into one ; which may be owing to their little motion, and the great preflure they are fubjedb to. i The toes are of great ufe to us in walking ; for, when the foie is raifed, they bring our body, with its centre of gravity, perpendicular to the advanced foot. The bones of the metatarsus and toes, are in the fame condition in children as thofe of the metacarpus and fingers. ' ' f ' The only bones now remaining to complete the defcrip- tlon of tire fkeletonj are the fmall ones which are found at the joints of the fingers and toes, and in fome other parts, called OSSA SESAMOIDEA. These are of very dilFerent figures and fizes, though they are generally faid to refemble the feed of the fefa- They feem to me nothing elfe than the liga- ments of the articulations, or the firm tendons of ftrong mufcles, or both, become bony by the comprefllon which they fufter. Thus the fefamoid bones at the beginning of the gaftrocnemii mufcles, are evidently compofed of the tendinous fibres only^ Thefe, at the firft joint of the great toe, are as plainly the fame continued fubfiance with the ligaments and the tendons of the adduÂ£lor, flexor, bre- vis, and abducflor. That which is fometimes double at the fecond joint of that toe is part of the capfular ligament; and if we enumerate the other fefamoid bones that are at any time found, we may obferve all of them formed in this manner Their number, figure, fituation, and mag- nitude, are fo uncertain, that it were in vain to infill on

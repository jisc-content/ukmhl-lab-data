168 OF THE SKELETON. Part I- that, is made flat and rough where the facro-lumbalis and longHTimus dorfi rife; and to its outfide are fixed liga- ments extended to the os facrum and tranfverfe procefles of the fifth and fourth vertebrae of the loins (w) Below the anterior fpinal procefs another protuberance ftands out, .which by its fituation may be diftinguiflied from the for- mer, by adding the epitliet of inferior^ where the mufculus redlus tibiae has its origin (.v).—Between thefe two anterior procelTes the bone is hollowed where the beginning of the fartorius mufcle is lodged. Below the pofterior fpinal procefs, a fecond protuberance of the edge of this bone is in like manner obfervable, which is clofely applied to the , os facrum. Under this lall procefs a eonfiderable large niche is obfervable in the os ilium ; between the fides of which and the ftrong ligament that is ftretched over from the os facrum to the fliarp pointed procefs of the os ifehium of the recent fubjetfl, a large hole is formed, through which the mufculus pyriformis, the great fciatic nerve, and the poflerior crural veflels, pafs, and are .prote£led from compfelfion. The external broad fide, or dorfum of the os ilium, is a little hollow towards the fore-part; farther back, it’ is as much raifed ; then is connderably concave; and, laftly, it is convex. Thefe inequalities are occafioned by the ac- tions of the mufclcs that are fituated on this furface. From behind the uppermoft of the two anterior fpinal pro- ceflTes, in fuch bones as are ftrongly marked by the muf- cles, a femicircuhir ridge is extended to the hollow paflage of the fciatic nerve. Between the fpine and this ridge, the gluteus medius takes its rife. Immediately from above the lowed of the anterior fpinal procefles, a fecond ridge is ftretched to the niche. Between this and tlie former ridge, (i/) Weitbrecht, Synclefmbl^. fcifV. 4. § 39, 40. 46. 47. rjc) B4kcr, Cui’f. Orteolog. demonftr. 3.

The teeth are feen for a confiderable time in form of mucus ccontained in a membrane; afterwards a thin cortical plate nand fome few ofleous layers appear within the membrane, vwith a large cavity filled with mucus in the middle; and gra- fdually this exterior fliell turns thicker, the cavity decreafes, t the quantity of mucus is leflened, and this induration pro- cceeds till all the body is formed, from which the roots are af” t ter wards produced. In young fubjedls, different ftamina or rudiments of teeth rare to be obferved. Thofe next the gums ordinarily hinder tthe deeper feated ones from making their way out, "while tthefe prevent the former From fending out roots, or from cn- ttering deep into the bony fockets of the jaws; by which they t come to be lefs fixed.

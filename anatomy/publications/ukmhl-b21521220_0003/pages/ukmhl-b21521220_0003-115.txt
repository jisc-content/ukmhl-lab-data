Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 73 rence towards a centre. From tins ridge of each bone the temporal mufcle rifcs: and, by the prclTure of its fi' res, occafions the furrows juft now mentioned.—B low thefe we obferve, near the femicircular edges, a great many ri- fings and depreflions, which are joined to like inequalitie.s on the infide of the temporal bone, and form the fqua- nious future. The temporal bone may therefore feive here as a buttrefs, to prevent the lower fide of the parietal from ftarting outwards when its upper part is prelTed or ftruck («). Near the upper fidcs of thefe bones, towards the hind part, is a fmall hole in each, through which a vein pafles' from the teguments of the head to the longitudinal finus. Sometimes I have fecn a branch of the temporal artery pafs through this hole, to be diftributed to the upper part of the falx, and to the dura mater at its fides, where it had frequent anaftomofes with the branches of the arteries de- rived from the external carotids, which commonly have the name of the arteries of the dura mattefj and with the branches of the internal carotids which go to the falx.— In feveral ikulls, one of the ofla parietalia has not this hole: In others, there are two in one bone; and in fome, not one in either. Mod frequently this hole is through both tables; at other times the external table only is per- forated.—The knowledge of the courfe of thefe veflels may be of ufc to furgeons wdien they make any incifion near this part of the head ; left, if the veflels are raihly cut near the hole, they fhtink within the fubtfance of the bone, and fp caufe an obrtinatc haemorrhagy, which neither liga- tures nor medicines can flop. On the inner concave fiuface of the parietal bones, we fee a great many deep furrows, difpofed fomewftut like the branches of trees; the furrows arc largeft and deepeft aC VoL. I.

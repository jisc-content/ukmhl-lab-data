lyo OF THE SKELETON. Parti. The fternum moft frequently has four fmall round bones, furrouiided with cartilage, in children born at the full time ; the uppermoft of thefe, which is the firft bone, be- ing the largeft. —rwo or three other very fmall' bony points are likewife to be feen in feveral children Tlie number of bones increafes for fome years, and then diminifli- es, but uncertainly, till they are at laft united into thofe a- bove defcribcd of an adult. The ufes of this bone are, to afford oi igin and infertion to feveral mufcles *, to fuftain the mediaflinum: to defend the vital organs, the heart and lungs, at the fore-part; and lallly, by ferving as a moveable fulcrum of the ribs^ to affifl confiderably in refpiration : which adion, fo far as it depends on the motion of tlie bones, we are now at liberty to explain. When the ribs that are connedled by their cartilages to the flernum, or to the cartilages of the true ribs, are ac- ted upon by the intercoflal niufdes, they mufl all be pulled from the oblique pofition which their cartilages kept them in, nearer to right angles with the vertebitc and flernum, becaufe the firft or uppermoft rib is by much the moft fix- -td.of .any ; and the cartilages making a greater refiftance to raifing the anterior ends of the ribs, their large arched middle parts turn outwards as well as upwards. -The fternum, prefled ftrongly on both fidcs by the cartilages of the ribs, is pufhed forwards, and that at its feveral parts, in proportion to the length and motion of its fupporters the ribs ; chat is, moft at its lower end— The fternum and the cartilages, thus ralfcd forwards, muft draw the diaphragm conne<5led to them : confequently fo faf ftretch it, and bring it nearer to a plane. The power that raifes this bone and the cartilages, fi:ices them fufficiently to make them refift the adion of the diaphragm, whofe fibres con- trad at il.e fame time, and thruft the vifeera of rfie abdo- men

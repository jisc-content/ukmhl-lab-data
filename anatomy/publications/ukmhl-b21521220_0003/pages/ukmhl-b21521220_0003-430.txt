388 SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. Part II ferve either to hold firm fome part from whence the mufcle arifes, or to bend it together with the mufcle, or elfc to change its action from the perpendicular to the diagonal, by concurring to aflill its force at the fame time. Remote mufcles often aflin; each other, the fuperior mufcles keep- ing the bone, whence the inferior acllng mufcles arife, firm and fteady. Therefore, the a£fion of no one mufcle can be underftood from confidering it alone ; but all the others, which are either inferted into the mufcle itfelf, or into any of the parts to which the mufcle adheres, mult likewife be brought into the confideratiem. By thefe mufcles, varloufly confpiring and oppoflng each other, are performed walking, flanding^ flexion, exten- lion, deglutition, and all the other geftures and offices of the feveral parts in the living body., But the mufcles Have likewife fome common a£tions, by which they are of ufe to the whole animal. They haften the return of the venous blood, by prefling it out both from the veins of the mufcles themfelves, and from the veins which lie be- tween them ; for the blood in thefe vefTels, diftributed be* tween the turgid bundles of a contradted mufcle, is, by the valves, determined towards the heart: they likewife return the fat to the blood; and fhake, grind, or con- denfe the arterial blood, and return it quicker to the lungs j they contribute in a great degree to the fecretions and excretions : Again, in the liver, mefentery, womb, See. they promote the courfe of the contained blood, bile, and other juices, fo as to leflen the danger of their flagnation : they ferve alfo to increafe the ftrength of the llomach, by adding their own ftrength to it, whereby digeftion is pro- moted j infomuch that all fedentary and inaftive courfes of life are contrary to nature,, and pave the way to difeafes from a ftagnation of the humours, or from a corruption or crudity of the aliments* The large mufcles, wTich are generally

OF THE BONES J4 Part I. dcnt^ that there is a conftant circulation of fluids in every part of them; and that there is a perpetual wafle and re- newal of the particles which compofe the folid fibres of bones, as well a^ of other parts of the body j the addi- tion from the fluids exceeding the wafle during the growth of the bones ; the renewal and wafle keeping nearly equal in adult middle age; and the wafle exceeding the fupply from the liquors in old age ; as is demonflrable from their t weight: for each bone increafes in weight as a perfon ap- proaches to maturity ; continues of nearly the fame weight till old age begins, and then becomes lighter. The fpecific gravity of the folid fides, on the contrary, increafes by age; for then they become more hard, compact, and denfe. In confequence of this, the bones of old people are thin- ner and firmer in their fides, and have larger cavities, than thofe of young perfons. The vafcular texture of bones muft make them fubjedb to obflrudlions, ecchymofes, ulcers, gangrenes, and moft other difeafes with which the fofter parts are afFedded ; and therefore there may be a greater variety of caries than is commonly deferibed (/>). Hence we can account for the following appearances.

Parts of the Upper Extremities, The whole Arm is divided, as In the Ikeleton, into the fhoulder, the arm properly fo called, the fore-arm, and the hand. But to thefe we muft here add the flioulder, the aiilla or arm-pit, the elbow, the fold of the arm, and the hollow of the hand. What is called the Ihoulder, is formed by the flefhy belly of the mufculus deltoides ; and the axilla, by the correfponding edges of the pedloralis major and latif- fimus dorfi. The elbow anfwers to the oJecranum; the fold of the arm is on the fore-fide of the articulation of the os humeri, with the bones of the fore-arm, and the hollow of the hand is in the middle of the palm. The arm, properly fo called, is principally covered, from the fhoulder downward, by the biceps, brachialis, and the triceps. The fore-arm is furnilhed with thofe mufcles which move the radius on the ulna, and the carpus on the fore-arm. The hand has few very confiderable flefhy parts, except the mufcles of the thumb and little finger, the lumbricales and interoflei. The arteries of the upper extremity are : Arterla axilla- ris ; arteria humeralis ; arterite fcapulares j arteria articu- laris; arteria brachialis; arteriae collaterales ; arteria cubi- talis; arteria radialis ; arteria interofleae anterior ; arterix interoflex pofteripres.

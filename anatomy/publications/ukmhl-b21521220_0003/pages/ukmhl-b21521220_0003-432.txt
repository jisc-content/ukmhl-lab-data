SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. Part ir. 39^ latter in the conflruaion of the uterus, veflels, and mem- branes. It by no means depends on the vital powers, but may endure long after death ; it is not completely deftroy- ed even by putrefaftion. During life it is diminifhed by various caufes, and again rellored by feveral remedies. Ir- ritability, which Haller thought exUled in the fibres of the mufcles alone, and which indeed was known by name, but not in reality to Gliflbn, is a kind of animal power, un- known to earlier anatomifts, and is different from that power which Hippocrates calls It is proved, from the experiments of Lups, Haller, Fontana, Hoffman, and feveral others, to differ from elaflicity in its rife, duration, feat, caufes, effefts, and phenomena. We fliall add a few remarks: 1. It is mofl pov/erful in the mufcular fibres of the whole body, but not equ illy difperfed through all; more power- ful in the heart, mufcles of refplration, and inteflines, but becomes gradually weaker among the voluntary mufcles ; and it exifls -perhaps, in a fmall degree, in the velfcls and membranes, as appears from the doubts offered by AVhyte, De Flaen, Van Doeveren, &c. which Haller and the learn- ed Cigna have anfwered. 2. The phenomena of irritability, and the irritations themfelves by which thefe phenomena are produced, are not always the fame: In fome paits we conftantly perceive a manifefl irritability produced by every irritation, as is the cafe 4n almoft all the mufcles. in many other parts yop fee the greatefl inconftancy and very irregular effects> varying difl'erently, at different times, being fometimes in- creafed and fometimes diminifhed, at one time yielding to, and at another refifling the irritations: all which is evident .in the fidn, vifeera, vtffels, and iris. , 3.

Chap. ir. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 217 is contiguous to the os.unciforme. The lower end, which fuftains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is trian- gular, nightly hollowed, and farther advanced on the in- ternal fide than on the external, having a confiderable oblong deprefiion made on the advanced infide by the me- tacarpal bone of the fore-finger; and generally there is a fmall mark of the os metacarpi digiti annularis on its ex- ternal fide. Os unaforme (i) has got its name from a thin broad pro- cefs that Hands out from it forwards into the, palm, and is hollow on its infide, for affording paffage to the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. To this procefs alfo the tranfverfc ligament is fixed that binds down and defends thefe tendons •, and the flexor and abduclor mufcles of the little finger have part of their origin from it. The upper plain furface is fmall, convex, and joined with the os lu- nare : The internal fide is long, and flightly convex, adapt- ed to the contiguous os magnum. The external furface is oblique, and irregularly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform bone. The lower end is divided into cwo concave furfaces ; the external is joined with the metacar- pal bone of the little finger; and the internal one is fitted to the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. In the defcriptlon of the preceding eight bones, I have only mentioned thofe plain furfaces covered with cartilage, by which they are articulated to each other, or to fome other bones, except in fome few cafes, where fomething extraordinary was to be obferved ; and I have defignedly omitted the other rough furfaces, left, by crowding too many words in the defeription of fuch fmall bones, the whole fliould be unintelligible. But thefe fcabrous parts of the bones may eafily be underftood'after mentioning their figure, if it is obferved, that they are generally found on- VoL. I. E e ]y («) Cuneiformc.

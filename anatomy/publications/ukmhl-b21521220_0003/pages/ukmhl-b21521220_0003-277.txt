Chap.II. INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 235 fide of this cavity, which is fmooth, and in a recent fub- je(R is covered with cartilage, is produced into a confider- able procefj, commonly named malleolus internus (/); the point of which is divided by a notch, and from it liga- ments are ifent out to the foot. We ought to obferve here, that this internal malleolus is fituated more forwards than the internal condyle of the upper end of this bone ; which is neceflary to be remembered in reducing a fra£Iure of the leg {h). The external fide of this end of the tibia has a rough irregular femilunar cavity formed in it for recei- ving the lower end of the fibula. The poflerior fide has two lateral grooves, and a fmall middle protuberance. In the internal depreflion, the tendons of the mufculus tibia- lis pofticus and flexor digitorum longus are lodged; and - in the external, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis plays. > From the middle protuberance, ligamentous flieaths go out, for tying down thefe tendons. The articulations and motions of the tibia fiiall be explain- ed, after all the three bones of the leg are defcribed. Both the ends of the tibia are cartilages at birth, and be- come afterwards epiphyfes. FIBULA. FinuLA (/), is the fmall long hope, placed on the out- fide of the leg, oppofite to the external angle of the tibia ; the fhape of it is irregularly triangular. The head- of the fibula has a fuperficial circular cavity formed on its Infide, which, in a recent fubjedl, is covered with a cartilage*, and it is fo clofely conne£led to the tibia by ligaments, as to allow only a fmall motion backwards G g 2 and (»■) Jjiufoy, Tt(T(r»f, Talus, claviciila, clavilla interior, clavilla donieflica.

393 Part IL , OF MUSCULAR MOTION. cfFeftj which is not in general agreeable to the laws of nature. We Ihould find other confequences arife from fuch an hypothefis, which tend to weaken the credibility of it. tor inftance, if in a found animal the vis nervea alone pro- duces the contradfion of the mufclcs, we will afk, what purpofe the vis infita ferves ? If both operate, are we to fuppofe that the vis nervea, impelled by the mind or living principle, gives the order, which the vis infita executes; and that the nerves are the internuntii; and fo admit two wife agents employed in every the moft fimple aÂ£Iion ? But inftead of fpeculating farther, let us learn the effedls of experiments, and endeavour from thefe to draw plain con- clufions. 1. When I poured a folution of opium in water under the fkin of the leg of a frog, the mufcles, to the furface bf which it was applied, were very foon deprived of the power of contrablion. In like manner, when I poured , this folution into the cavity of the heart, by opening the vena cava, the heart was almoft inftantly deprived of its power of motion, whether the experiment was performed bn it fixed in its place, or cut out of the body. 2. I opened the thorax of a living frog, and then tied br cut its aorta, fo as to put a flop to the circulation of its blood. I then opened the vena cava, and poured the folution of opium into the heart ; and found, not only that this organ was inftantly deprived of its powers of ablion, but that in a few minutes the moft diftant rrrufcles of the limbs were extremely weakened. Yet this weaknefs was not owing to the want of circulation; for the frog could jump about for more than an hour after the heart was cut cut. In the firft of thefe two experiments, we obferve the fup- VoL. I. 2 ^ pofed

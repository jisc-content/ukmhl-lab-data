OF THE SKELETON. Part I, 66 —Behind each external angular procefs, the furface of the frontal bone is confiderably depreflVd where part of the tem- poral mufcle is placed. The foramina^ or holes, obfervable on the external fur- face of the frontal bone, are three in each fide. One in each fuperciliary ridge, a little removed from its middle tow-ards the nofe? through which a twig of the ophthal- mic branch of the fifth pair of nerves paffes out of the or- bit, with a fmall artery from the internal carotid, to be aliftributed to the teguments and mufcles of the forehead. -—Thefe veiTels, in fome ilculls, make furrows in the os fronds, efpecially in the bones of children, as has alfo been obferved of another confiderable vefiTel of this bone near its middle and therefore we ought to beware of tfanf- verfe incifions on either fide of the os frontis, which might either open thefe vtflels, or hurt the nerves, while they are yet in part within the bone: for when veflels are thus wounded, it is difficult to ftop the hsemorrhagy, becaufe the adhefion of a part of the artery to the bone hinders its contraction, and confequently ftyptics can have little efFecf j the fides of the furrow keep off compreffing fubftances* from the artery; and we would wifn to fhun cauteries or cfcharotics, becaufe they make the bone carious; and nerves, wdien thus hurt, fometimes produce violent fymp- toms.—^—But to return to the fuperciliary foramina, we mud remark, that often, inftead of a hole, a notch only is to be feen : nay, in fome flculls, fcarce a veftige even of this is left; in others, both hole and notch are obfervable, when the nerve and artery run feparately. Frequently a hole is found on 'one fide, and a notch on the other; at other times we fee two holes, or there is a common hole without, and two MiftinCt entries internally. The reafon of this variety of a hole, notch, depreflion, or fmootlihefs. (/•) Ruyfeh. Muf. Anat. theca D, repofit. 4. 3.

Chap. II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 213 motion in comparifon of what the other has, ami fcrves as a bafe to the moveable half; which can be extended back very little farther than to a flraight line with the fore-arm, but can be confid^srably bent forwards. As the bone^ that compofe the hand are of different fhapes and ufes, while feveral of them that are contiguous agree in fome general charafters ; the hand is, on this account, com- monly divided into carpus, metacarpus, and fingers; among which laft the thumb is reckoned, CARPUS. The carpus (2) is compofed of eiglit fmall fpongy bones, fituated at the upper part of the hand. I fhall defcribe each of thefe bones, under a proper name taken from their figure (a); becaufe the method of ranging them by num- bers leaves anatomifts too much at liberty to debate very idly, which ought to be preferred to the firfl number; or, W'hat is worfe, feveral, without explaining th&-order they obferve, apply the fame numbers differently, and fo con- found their readers. But, that the defeription of thefe bones may be in the fame order as they are found in the generality of anatomical books, I fhall begin with the range of bones that are concerned in the moveable joint of the wrift, or are connefted to the fore-arm, and fhall afterwards confider the four that fupport the, thumb and offa metacarpi of the fingers. The eight bones of the carpds are, Os fcaphoides, lunare, cuneiforme, pififorme, trapezium, trapezoides, magnum, un- ciforme. ~ The fcaphoides is fituated mofl internally of thofe that are articulated with the fSre-arm.â€”- The Jimare imme- diately {z) Krf/f.

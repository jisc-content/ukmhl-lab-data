[ 3 3 That little might be omitted of what was formerly done on this fubjeft, I have taken all the afTiftance 1 could fiom books; but have never aflerted any anatomical faftimi their authority, with- out confulting nature, from which all the dcfcriptlons are made : and therefore the quotations from fuch books ferve only to do juf- tice to the authors, who have remarked any thing in the flruc- ture of the parts that was commonly omitted, and to initiate you in the hiftory of anatomy; which I once propofed to make com- plete, fo far as related to this fubjeft: But not being able to pro- cure feveral books, and being fenfible how many more may have never come to my knowledge, I laid afide this defign, of purpofe omitted many I could have inferted, and in fomc places I have changed an older author for a later one who has more fully or clearly deferibed what I treated of. Befide anatomifts, I have al* fo named feveral other authors to confirm my reafoning by prafti- cal cafes ; of which it is not to be fuppofed my own experience could furnifli a fufficient variety. You will readily obferve, that I quote no paflages with a view to criticife or condemn them. This precaution of giving no of- fence, is very neceflary in thofe who are fufficicntly confeious of their being liable to lay themfelvcs open to juft cenfure; and ic prevents occafions of ufelefs wrangling, in vvhich generally both ^parties are lofers, and the public has little advantage. In this treatife I always make ufe of the moft common name of each part, and have put the fynonymous name to be met with in books at the foot of the page, that the reading might be fmooth- cr, and you might confult them at your lelfure to affift you in un- derftanding different authors. The deferiptions and reafonings arc blended, without which I always find young anatomifts art foon difguilcd with authors : Their imaginations cannot follow a long chain of deferiptions, efpccially when they are not taught at the fame time the ufes which the deferibed parts ferve : Their minds muft have fome re- laxation, by a mixture of reafoning, which never miffes to ftrike the fancy agreeably, and raifes a ftrong defire to underftand the principles on which it depends. The phenomena of difeafes are. all deduced in this eflay from A 2 the

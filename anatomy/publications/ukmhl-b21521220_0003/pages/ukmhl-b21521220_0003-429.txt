Part II. OF MUSCULAR MOTION. 387 fiich, that a given aÂ£lion of the will produces a new and determinate celerity in the nervous fluid. There are various means by which the motions of the mufdes are rendered more fafe, certain, and eafy. The Inrgc long mufcles, by which the greater motions of flexure are performed, being included in tendinous capfules or ca- fes, drawn and tightened by other mufcles, are thus fecu- red and (Irengchened ; and thus the mufcle, in a ftate of con- trafiron, remains prefled againft the bone ail the time that the limb is bent, and confequently avoids a confidera'ble lofs of its power. The long tendons, which are incurvated or extended over joints in their motion, are received and con- fined by peculiar ligaments, which retain them within their fiippery channels; and in thefe flieaths a particular liquor is feparated for the lubricating of the tendons. Nature makes a fimilar provifion for thofe mufcles which perfo- rate others in their courfe. In other parts, the tendons are either carried rouml certain -eminences of the bone, in order that they may be inferred at greater angles into the bone which they move ; or elfe they are inferted into an- other bone, from whence a different tendon defeends un_ der a larger'angle into the bone to be moved. In other parts, the mufcles which are derived from convenient fi- tuations, have their tendons carried round in a contrary diredlion by nature, fo that they pafs into the part to be moved as it were round a pulley. Nature has likewife fur- rounded the mufcles on all (ides with a confiderabie quan- tity of fat, which is fpread alfo between 'their bundles of fibres, and alfo between the fmall fibres themfelves : w.hich fat, being prefled out by the turgefcence of the mufcles and fibres, renders them fofc, flexible, fiippery, and fit for motion. Moreover, the power and adfion of one mufcle is deter- mined by the co-operations or oppofitions of others, which . 3 C 2 ferve

OF THE SKELETON. blood-veiTels and nerves which pafs upon it; and near tho end of each of thefe ridges, a fiuall fmooth protuberance may often be rerr.arked, w^hcre the two heads of the exter- nal gahrocnemius mufcle take their rife, and where fefamoid bones are fometimes found (c); and from the fore-part of the internal tubercle a flrong ligament is extended to the in- fide of the tibia. The lower end of the os femoris is larger than any other part of It, and is formed into a great protuberance on^ each Cdes, called its condyles; between which a confiderable ca- vity is found, efpecially at the back-part, In vduch the cru- ral vcffels and nerves lie immeiTed in fat. The internal condyle is longer than the external, which mull happen from the oblique poGtion of this bone, to give lefs obli- quity to the leg. Each of thefe procefies feem to be divi- ded Into its plain fmooth furface. The mark of diviGon on the external is a notch, and on the internal a fmall protuberance. The fore-part of this divIGon, on which the rotula moves, is formed like a pulley, the external Gde of which is higheft. Behind, there are tavo oblong large Leads, w'hofe greatefl extent is backvrards, for the motion of the tibia: and from the rough cavity between them, but near to the bafe of the internal condyle, the ftrong liga- ment, commonly called the crofs one, has its rife. A little above which a protuberance gives infertion to the tendon of the triceps. The condyles, both on the outer and inner fide of the knee, are made ilat by the mufcles palTing along them. On the back-part of the internal, a Gight depref- fion is made by the tendons of the gracilis and fartorius; and on the external fuch another is for.med by the biceps flexor cruris ; behind which a deep fofia is to be obferved, where the poplitxus mufcle has its origin. From the tu- bercle immediately before this cavity, a ftrong ligament goes V (c) Vcfal. lib. I. cap. jS. & 3c.

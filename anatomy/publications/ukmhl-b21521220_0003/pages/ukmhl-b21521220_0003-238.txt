OF THE SKELETON. 196 - Part I. and with the angle at the upper part of this fide about three inches, and the lower angle at a greater diilance, from thtfe procefles. The back-part of the fcapula has no- thing but the tliin ends of the ferratus anticus major and fubfcapularis mufcles between it and the ribs : But as this bone advances forwards, its diftance from the ribs incrcafes. Iheuppepor (horter fide, called xiw: fuptrior cofta^ of the fcapula, is nearly horizontal, and parallel with the feeond rib. The lower fide, whicJi is named the inferior cof.a^ is extended obliquely from the third to the eighth rib. The 'fituation of this bone, here dcf-.ribed, is when people are fitting or (landing in a date of ina(Sli\ity, and allov.’ing the members to remain in the mod natural eafy poflure. The inferior angle of the fcapula is very acute ; the upper one is near to a right angle •, and what is called the anterior does not deferve the name, for the two Tides do not meet to form an angle. The body of this bone is concave to- wards the ribsV «ind convex behind, where it has the name of dorftim (/)• Three procelTeS' are generally reckoned to proceed from the fcapula, d he firil is the large fpine that riles from its convex furface behind, and divides it une- qually. The feeond procefs Rands out from the fore part of the upper fide : and, from its imaginary refemblar.ee to a crow’s beak, is named coracoidcs (u). The third proceis Is the whole thick bulbous fore-part of tbe bone. After thus naming the fcveral conllitucnt parts of the fcapula, the particular defeription will be more eafily under- ftood. The bafe, which is tipped with cartilage in a young fub- je£l, is not all ftraight: for above the fpine it runs obli- quely forwards to the fuperior angle, that here it might jiot be too protuberant backwards, and fo bruife the muf- cles (<) Xt^UVIC/V^ («) Anchoroides, figmoides, digitalis, ancidroides.

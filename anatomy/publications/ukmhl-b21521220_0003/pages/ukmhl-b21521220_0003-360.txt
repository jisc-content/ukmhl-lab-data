Trapezius feu Cucularis, Arifest by a ftrong round tendon, from the lower part of the protuberance in the middle of the os occipitis be- hind ; and, by a thin membranous tendon, which covers part of the fplenius and complexus mufcles, from the rough curved line that extends from the. protuberance to- wards the mafloid procefs of the temporal bone •, runs down along the nape of the neck ; where it feems to arife from j » its fellow, and covers the fpinous proctlTes of the fuperior vertebrae of the neck; but rifes from the fpinous procefles of the two inferior, and from the fpinous procefles of all the vertebrae of the back ; adhering, tendinous, to its fellow, the whole length of its origin. Inferted, flelhy, into the pofterior half of the clavicle ; ten- dinous and flefhy, into the acromion, and into almoft all the fpine of the fcapula. I Ufe. Moves the fcapula according to the three different di- rections of its fibres ; for the upper defeending fibres draw it obliquely upwards, the middle tranfverfe ftralght fibres draw it directly backwards, and the Inferior afeending fibres draw it obliquely downw’ards and backwards.

IN GENERAL. Chap. I. rr.oiftened by fynovia, their external furface is ftlll fome- what cartilaginous, and they are not yet united to their bones. 3. At eighteen or twenty years of age the epiphyfes are entirely ofhfied, and have blended their fibres fo with the body of the bone, as to make them infeparable without vio- > lence. The knowledge of this part of the ofteogeny I think ne- ceflary to prevent dangerous miflakes in the cure of feve- ral difeafes. As for example; Without this knowledge, the reparation of an epiphyfe might be miftaken for a frac- ture or luxation. The interftice of two parts of a bone not yet joined might be judged to be a fiflure. A dia- ftafis, or reparation of fuch disjointed pieces of a bone, might be thought a fraflure.- The protrufion of one piece, or its overlopping any other, could be miftaken for an excrefcence or exoftofis. Such errors about the na- ture of a difeafe would give a perfon very different indica- tions of cure from what he would have if he really under- ftood his patientâ€™s cafe : And very often the k^^owledge of the different inequalities on the furfaces of bones, muft direct us in the execution of what is proper to be done to cure feveral of their difeafes. OF THE CONNECTION OF BONES. Having thus confidcred the bones when fingle, we ought next to fliew the different manner of their con- junftions (/). To exprefs thefe, anatoraifts have contri- ved a great number of technical terms; about the mean- propriety, and claffing of which, there has unluckily been variety of opinions.

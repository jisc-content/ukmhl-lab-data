74 OF THE SKELETON. Part I. the lower edge of each bs parietale, efpecia,lly near its an- terior angle, where a complete canal is fomeiimes formed. They afterwards divide into fmall furrows, in their pro- grefs upwards. -In fome (kulls a large furrow begins at the hole near the upper edge, and divides into branch- es, which join with thofe ^that come upwards; fhewing the communications of the upper and lower veflels of tho dura mater. In thefe furrows we frequently fee pafi'a- ges into the diploe ,*iand fometimes I have obferved canals going off, wdiich allowed a fmall probe to pafs a few inches into the lx>ny fubftance. Some (x) authors tell us, that they have obferved thefe canals piercing the bone towards the oc- ciput.—On the infide of the upper edge of the ofla parieta- lia, there is a large rinuolity, frequently larger in the bone of one fide than of the otlier, v'here the upper part of the falx is faflened, and the fuperior longitudinal films is lotl- ged—Part of the lateral finufcs generally makes a depref- fion near the angle, formed by the lower and pofterior fides of thefe bones; and the pits made by the prominent parts of the brain are to be feen in no part of the Ikull more frequent or more confiderable, than in the internal furface of thefe bones. ^ j The ofla parietalia are the moll equal and fmooth,. and .are among the thinnefh bones of the cranium ; but tliey enjoy the general ftruclures of two tables and diploe tiie completefl. , Thefe bones are joined at their fore-flde to the os frontis by the coronal future; at their long inferior angles, to- the fphenoid bone, by part of the future of this name; at their lower edge, to the ofla temporum, by the fquamous future, and its pofleiior additamentum ; behind, to the os occipitis, or ofl'a triquetra, by the lambdoid future ; and above, to one another, by the fagittal futute.

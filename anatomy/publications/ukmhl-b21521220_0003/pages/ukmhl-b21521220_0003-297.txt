That wherever the tendons and ligaments are firm- eft, the a£lions of the mufcles ftrongeft, and the com- preffion greateft, there fiich bones are moft commonly found. 2. That, caieris paribus, the older the fubje£l is in which they are fought, their number is greater, and their fize larger. 3. The more labour any perfon is inured to, he has, ceteris paribus, the moft numerous and largeft olTa fefamoi- dea. However, as the two at the firft joint of the great toe are much larger than any other, are early formed, and are feldom wanting in an adult, we may judge, that be- fides the more forcible caufe of their formation, there fliould alfo be fome particular advantage neceffary at this place, rather than elfewhere; which may poffibly be, to allow the flexor mufcles to fend their tendons along this joint, fecure from corapreffion in the hollow between the two oblong fefamoid bones ; while by removing thefc tendons from the centre of motion, and giving them the advantage of an angle at their infertion, the force of the mufcle is Increafed; and therefore the great fuperin- cumbent weight of our body in progreflion is more eafdy raifed.

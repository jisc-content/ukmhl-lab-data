SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. Partir. 374 brane is extended, as foon as the caufe of extenfion is taken off, it returns by a gentle effort to its former fhort- nefs. But it even fomevvhat refills the attempt to perpetual diftenfion ; and by a gentle, but continual, approach of its elements to pne another, it propells the contained fat, or wa- ter, or othey bodies accidentally introduced into it. The fame power alfo fee ms to limit the excretion of vapour; for the fibres an'd plates of the cellular texture being preternatu- rally relaxed, an immenfe quantity, either of fat or of watery humour, is depofited in that texture. And this de- bility feeras to be the principal caufe of a dropfy, The fame caufe being always efficacious, and at work in the heart, joints, and every where throughout the body of the embyro, brings into nearer conta£l the arteries, auricles, and ventricles; produces flexures; and contrafls the heart into the form qf a cone. The fame caufe, by an unknown or hidden power, feems to form the fliape of mod parts of .the human body ; and while it expels the gluten received into the cells, it brings the terreftrial particles nearer to one another, and gives the proper folidity, curvature, and fituation, to,the different parts. It is the nature of this power to adl continually by gentle but uninterrupted efforts. It is common for it alfo to be ex-, cited by poifons, in every membrane, fibre, and in the cellular texture but never by cutting or punefluring with a .fharp indrument. Thefe are the known properties of the red piufcular fibre. The flru£lure of this fibre, then, it is now neceffary for us to confidcr. By tlie'name of nuifcular or moving fibres in the human body, we call bundles of reddifh coloured threads, which perform all the motions vifible in the human body. When many of thefe fibres are colle£led together, and appear more evidently red, they are called a mufde. The ex- treme fimplicity ‘of the texture in thefe parts has been the caufi?

OF THE SKELETON. Panl. 182 In confequence, too, of this increafed obliquity of the lower ribs, each of their cartilages makes a greater curve in its progrefs from the rib towards the fternum ; and the tubercles, that are articulated to the tranfverfe procefles of the vertebrae, have their fmooth furfaces gradually facing more upwards The ribs becoming thus more oblique, while the fternum advances forwards in its dcfcent, makes the diftance between the fternum and the anterior end of the lower ribs greater than between the fternum and the ribs above; confequently the cartilages of thofe ribs that are joinejd to the breafl-bone are longer in the lower than in the higher ones. Thefe cartilages are placed nearer to each other as the ribs defcend, which occafions the curva- ture of the eartllages to be greater. The length of the ribs increafes from the firfl and up- permoft rib, as far down as the 'feventh ; and from that to the twelfth, it gradually dimiuifhes. The fuperior of the two plain, or rather hollow furfaces, by which the ribs are articulated to the bodies of the vertebrae, gradu- ally increafe from the firfl to the fourth rib, and is di- ininlfhed after that in each lower nb.—The dillance of their angles from the heacfs always increafes as they de- fcend to the ninth, becaufe of the greater breadth of the facrp- lumbalis mufcle (j-). The ribs are commonly divided into true and falfe. The true (t) coftje are the feven upper ones of each fide, whofe cartilages are all gradually longer as the ribs defcend, and are joined to the breaft-bone: fo that, being prefled conflantly between two bone's, they are flatted at both ends; and are thicker, harder, and more liable to offify, than the other cartilages that are not fubjeft to fo much pref- fure. Thefe ribs include the heart and lungs : and therefore are the proper or true custodes of life. The (j) Winflow, Expofition anatomiqiic des os fees, §64^. (/) rnis-/a/, Germans, legitim«.

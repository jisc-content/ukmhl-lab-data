Ruyfch (c) however affirms, that after injedlion he could trace the arteries into the hardell part of the teeth: And Leeuwen- hoek (t/j fufpe£l:ed the fibres of the cortex to be veflels. In children I have frequently injected the veffels of the teeth as far as their bafe ; ,and in fuch as are not entirely'offified, one can with a lucky injection fill fo many veflels as to make both the outfide and infide of the cortical part appear perfectly red. This plentiful fupply ofvelTels muft expofe the teeth to the fame diforders that.attack other vafcular parts ; and fuch teeth as have the greatell number of veffiels muft have the moft numerous chances of being feized wdth thefe difeafes. Every root of each tooth has a dlftin£l carral, with vef- fel and nerves> in it. Thefe canals in the teeth with more than one root, come nearer each other as they approach the bafe of the tooth; and at laft are only feparated by ve- ry thin plates, which, being generally Incomplete, allow a communication of all the canals; and frequently one com- mon cavity only appears within the bafe, in which a pulpy fubftance compofcd of nerves and veflels is lodged.—-The condition therefore of the nerves here bears a ftrong ana- logy to that of the cutaneous nerves which ferve for the fenfation of touching.

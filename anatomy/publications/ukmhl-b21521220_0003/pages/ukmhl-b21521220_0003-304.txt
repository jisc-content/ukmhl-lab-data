A fliort Account of the AUTHORj And of his WRITINGS. R JbHN Innes, author of the following Treatife, was borri at Callart, an obfcure village in the Highlands of Scot-i land. He came to Edinburgh at an early period of life, where he obtained the patronage and proteftion of Dr Alexander Monro, Profeffor of Anatomy ; who inftrudted him in the knowledge of the human bodyj and in the art of difleftion.

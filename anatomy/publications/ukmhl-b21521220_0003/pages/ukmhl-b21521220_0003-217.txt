Chap.IT. BONES OF THE TRUNK. '75 matter of debate. To me it feems evidently contrived for allowing a larger motion to the thigh inwards: For if the bony brims had been here continued, the neck of die thigh-bone mufl have ftruck upon them when the thighs were brought acrofs each other ; which, in a large flrong motion this way, would have endangered the neck of the one bone, or brim of the other. Then the veflTels which are diftributed to the joint may fafely enter at the finuofity in the bottom of the breach; which being, however, lar- ger than is neceflary for that purpofe, allows' the larger mucilaginous gland of the joint to efcape below the liga- ment, when the head- of the thigh-rbone is in hazard of prefTmg too much upon it in the motions of the thigh out- wards {d). Befides this difference in the height of the brims, the acetabulum is otherwife unequal; for the lower internal part of it is depreffed below the cartilaginous fur- face of the upper part, and is not covered with cartilage; into the upper part of this particular depreffion, where it is deepell and of a /emilunar form, the ligament of the thigh-bone, commonly, though improperly, called the round one, is inferted ; while, in its more fuperficial low'er part, the large mucilaginous gland of this joint is lodged. The greatell part of this feparate deprelTion is formed in the os ifchium. ' From what has been faid of the condition of the three ' bones compofing this acetabulum in new born children, it muft be evident that a confiderable part of this cavity is car- tilaginous in them. The oJa innominata are joined at their back-part to each fide of the os facrum by a fort of future, with a very thin intervening cartilage, which ferves as fo much glue to ce- , ment thofe bones together ; and flrong ligaments go from 'he (</) Petit.

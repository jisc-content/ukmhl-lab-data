And, laftly, its nafal procefs is conne£led to the nafal lamella of the ethmoid bone. The frontal bone ferves to defend and fupport the ante- rior lobes of the brain. It forms a confiderable part of the cavities that contain the globes of the eyes, helps to make up the feptum narium, organ of fmelling, &e.

The angle formed by this upper fide and the fore one, is fa extended, as to have the appearance of a procefs. Tlie external furface pf each os parietale is convex. Upon it, fornewhat below the middle height of the bone, there is a tranfverfe arched ridge, generally of a whiter colour than any other part of the bone ; from which in bones tliat have flrong prints of mufcles, we fee a great many conver- ging furrows, like fo many radii drawn from a circumfe- rence (<) Sopt/fnc, Paiia fyncipitls, verticisj arcu3Ua,.nerrali», cogitation is, ra.< tionis, bregnaatis, njadefaftioues.

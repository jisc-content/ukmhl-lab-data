OF THE SKELETON. 54 Part I. defending the brain and cerebellum, with their membranes, St vefTels, and nerves. ' The cavity of the cranium is' proportioned to its con- tents. Hence fuch ^ variety of its fize is obfervcd in dif- ferent fubje£ls; and hence it is neither fo broad nor fo deep at its fore-part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, ds' it is behind, where the large pofterior lobes of the brain, and the whole cerebellum, are con- tained. The roundifli figure of the Ikull, which makes It more capacious, and better able to defend its contents from ex- ternal injuries, is chiefly owing to the equal prelTure of thefe contained parts as they grow and increafe before it is entirely offified. It is to be obferved, however, that the fides of the cranium are deprefled below a fpherical furface by the firong temporal mufcles, whofe aftion hin- ders here the uniform protrufion of the bones, which is more equally performed in other parts where no fuch large mufcles are. In children whofe mufcles have not a£led much, and confequently have not had'great efleds on the bones, this depreffion is not fo remarkable; and there- fore their heads are much rounder than in adults. Thefe natural caufes, differently difpofed in different people, pro- duce a gre'at variety in the fhapes of fkulls, which is flill in- creafed by the different management of the heads of chil- dren when very young: So that one may know a Turk’s fkull by its globular figure, a German’s by its breadth and flatnefs of the occiput, Dutch and Englifli by their oblong fhapes, See. [d). Two advantages are reaped from this flatnefs of the Tides of the cranium, viz. the enlargement of our fphere of vifion, and more advantageous fituation of our ears for receiving a greater quantity of found, and for being lefs expofed to injuries.

Chap.II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 195 I one clavicle to the fame place of the other clavicle, ferves to keep each of thefe bones more firmly in their place. By the affiftance, however, of the moveable intervening cartilage, the clavicle can, at this joint, be railed or de- prefled, and moved backwards and forwards fo much as that the external end, which is at a great diflance from that axis, enjoys very confpicuous motions. The articulation of the exterior end of the clavicle fliall be confidersd after the def- cription of the fcapula. 4. The clavicles of infants are not deficient In any of their parts ; nor have they any epiphyfes at their extremities joined afterwards to their bodies, as mod other fuch long bones have, which preferve them from being bent too much, and from the danger of any unoflified parts being fe- parated by the force which pulls the arms forwards. The ufes of the clavicles are, to keep the fcapulse, and confequently all the fuperlor extremities, from falling in and forward upon the thorax ; by which, as in mod qua- drupeds, the motions of the arms M'ould be much con- fined, and the bread made too narrow. The clavicles like- wife afford origin to feveral mufcles, and a defence to large veffels. From the fituation, figure, and ufe of the clavicles, it is evident that they are much expofed to frailures ; and their broken parts mud generally pafs each other ^ and that they are difficultly kept in their place afterwards.

O^F THE SKELETON. Part I. find it.. The Inferior oblique procefTes of thif5 vertebra dentata anfwer exa6lly to the defcription given of thofe common to all the cervical vertebnc. The tranfverfe procefles of the vertebra dentata are fliort, very little hollowed at their upper part, and not forked at their ends ; and the canals through which the cervical ar- teries pafs are reflected outwards about the middle fub- ftance of each procefs ; fo that the courfe of thefe vefiels may be directed towards the tranfverfe procefles of the firft vertebra. Had this curvature of the arteries been made in a part fo moveable as the neck is, while they were not de- fended by a bone, and fixed to that bone, fcarce a motion could have been performed without the utmoft hazard of comprefTion, and a flop put to the courfe of the liquids, with all its train of bad confequences. Hence we obferve this fame mechanifm feveral times ufed, when there is any occafion for a fudden curvature of a large artery. This is the third remarkable inftance we have feen of it. The firfl was the pafTage of the carotids through the temr poral bones *, and the fecond was that lately defcribed in the vertebral arteries, turning round the oblique procefles of the firfl vertebra, to come at the great hole of the occipital fcone. The fpinal procefs of this vertebra dentata is thick, ftrong, and fliort, to give fufficient origin to the mufculi re£U majores. and obliqui inferlores, and to prevent the contuflon of thefe and other mufcles in pulling the head back. , This fecond vertebra' confifls, at the birth, of four bony pieces: For, befides the three which I have already men- tioned as common to all the vertebrte, the tooth-lIke pro- cefs of this bone is begun at this time to be offifled in its middle, and is joined as an appendix to the body of the bone.—Left this appendix be bent or difplaced, nurfes out to keep the heads of new born children from falling too

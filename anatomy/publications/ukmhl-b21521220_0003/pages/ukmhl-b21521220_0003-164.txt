OF THE SKELETON. Part I. 122 which the under-part of the mufculus buccinator is con- ne6led. Internally^ towards the upper edge of each fide another ridge appears, from which the mylo-hyoidei have their origin, and to which the internal membrane of the gums adheres. In the upper edge of both chin and Jides, are a great ma- ny deep pits or fockets, for receiving the roots of the teeth. The number and magnitude of thcfe fockets are various, becaufe of the different number, as well of the teeth them- felves, as of their roots, in different people, Thefe fock- ets in this lower jaw, as well as in the upper one, are lefs deep as old age comes on: when freed from the teeth by any means, they are fome time after filled up with an offeous net-work, which at laft becomes entirely folid, and as Dnooth as any other part of the bone; fo that, in a great many ' old jaws, we cannot obfcrve a veftige of the fockets : but then the jaw becomes lefs, and muck narrower (^r). Hence \Ve may know why the chin and nofe of edentulous people are much nearer than before the teeth were loft; while their lips either fall in towards their mouth, or ftand prominent -forwards. When new teeth are protruded, new fockets are formed (;■). The lower edge of the chin and fides is fmooth and equal, and is commonly called the bafe of the lower jaw.' '^I'he ends of the bafe, where the jaw turns upwards, are called its anglesthe external furface of each of which has feveral inequalities upon it, where the maf- fctcr niufcle is inferted •, as the internal furface alfo has, where the pterygoiJeus internus is inferted, and a ligament extended from the ftyloid procefs of the temporal bone is fixed. The procejfcs are two on each fide. The anterior ftiarp thin coronoid ones have the crotaphite mufcles infer- ted into them. The pofterior proceffes or condyles (j) terminate (y) Vefal.

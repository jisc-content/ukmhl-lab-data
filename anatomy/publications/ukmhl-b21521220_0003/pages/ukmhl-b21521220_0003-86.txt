! OF THE BONES Part I I i ing and confining the motion to fome one fide; fach are ii the crofs and lateral ligaments of the knee, the round one of |: the thigh, &c. j From this account of the ligaments, w'C may conclude, that, catcris paribus, in whatever, articulation the ligaments I are few, long, and weak, the motion, is more free and I quick; but luxations happen frequently; and, on the con- H traty, where the ligaments are numerous, fliort, and ftrong’, f the motion is more confined ; but fuch a joint is lefs ex- t pofed to luxations (/). Whence we may judge how ne- t ceflitry it is to attend to the different ligaments, and the s changes which have been made on them by a luxation, when j it is to be reduced. j Ligaments alfo fupply the place of boties in fevejral cafes i to advantage. Thus tlte parts in the pelvis are more fafe- ly fupported below hy ligaments than tliey could have beeti i by bone.— The ligaments placed in the great holes of the pfia innominata and, between the bones of the fore-arm and leg, afford convenient origin to mufcles.-^Immove- able bones .are firmly coime£led by them ; of which the conjunction of dip os facrum and linnonainatum is an ex- » ample. Tney afford a fockrt for moveable bones to play in, as we fee part of the allragalus does oa the ligament Ifretched from the heel-bone to the fcaphoid. Numerous inconveniences may arife from too long or fnqrr, flroug or weak, lax or rigid ligaments. ■ v:- U' O F T HE C A P. T !

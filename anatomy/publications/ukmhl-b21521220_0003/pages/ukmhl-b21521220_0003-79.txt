IN GENERAL. fewed together; and is formed by the fibres of two bones meeting while they are yet flexible and yielding, and have not come to their full extent of growth; fo that they mu- tually force themfclves into the interflices of each other, till, meeting with fu^i refiftance as they are not able to overcome, they are hopped from fprouting out farther, or are reflefted ; and therefore thefe indentations are very different both in figure and magnitude : thus the bones of the head are joined; thu^ epiphyfes are joined to the V bones, before their full connedtion and union with them. •Under this title of future^ the harmoma of the ancients may be comprehended *, fcarce any unmoved bones being joined by plain furfaces (y). 2. Gomphofts (z) is the fixing one bone into another, as a nail is fixed in a board : thus the teeth are fecured in their fockets. 3. Schindylefts or ploughing (a), when a thin lamella of one bone is received into a long narrow furrow of another : thus the proceflus azygos of the fphenoid, and the nafal procefs of the ethmoid bone, are received by the vomer. III. The third clafs, or Diarthrosis (h), is the arti- culation where the bones are fo loofely connedfed as to allow large motion. This is fubdivided into three kinds. 1. EnarthrofiSy or the ball and focket, when a large head is received into a deep cavity; as the head of the os femo- ris is into the acetabulum coxendicis. 2. Arthrodia^ when a round head is received into a fu- perficial cavity ; as in the articulation of the arm bone and fcapula. Thefe two fpecies of diarthrofis allow motion to all fides. 3.

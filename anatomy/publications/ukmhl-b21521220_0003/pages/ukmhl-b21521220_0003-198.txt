156 Part I. OF THE SKELETON. The hrft (d) vertebra, befides an oblong hollow in its lower edge, that affifts in forming the cavity wherein the fecond rib is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the firft rib formed in it. The fecond has the name of axillary (r), without any thing particular in its llruflure. The eleventh (y) often has the whole cavity for the ele- venth nb in its body, and wants the fmooth furface on each tranfverfe procefs. The twelfth (g) always receives the whole head of the laft rib, and has no fmooth furfaces of its tranfverfe pro- ceflcs, which are very ihort The fmooth furfaces of its inferior oblique prpcefTes face outwards as the lumbar do.-*—And we may fay in general, that the upper vertebrce of the back lofe gradually their refemblance to thofe of the neck, and the lower ones come nearer to the figure of the lumbar. The articulation of the vertebra of the back with the ribs, fliall be more particularly confidered after the ribs are defcribed. Only it may be proper now to remark, that the ligaments which ferve that articulation tilhll in connedling the vertebrtr. The lowefi: order of the true vertebrae -is the himlar (/j), which are five bones, that may be dihinguiflied from any others by thefe marks: i. Their bodies, though of a cir- cular form at their fore-part, are fomewhat oblong from one fide to the other; which may be occafioned by the preffure of the large yeflels, the aorta and cava, and of the vifcera. The epiphyfes on their edges are larger *, and therefore the upper and lower furfaces of their bodies are more concave than in the vertebrae of the back. 2. The • cartilages (</) Aofia, Guttiiralis.

Chap. XXII. 3'5 OF THE THORAX. life By means of thefe mufclcs, the ribs are equally rai- fed upwards during infpiration. Their fibres being oblique, : give them a greater power of bringing the ribs near each I other, than could be performed by llraight ones. But, by the obliquity of the fibres, they are almoll brought conti- ! guous: and as the fixed points of the ribs are before and I behind, if the external had been continued forwards to the Ifternum, and the internal backwards to the fpine. It would lhave hindered their motion, which is greateft in the middle, I though the obliquity of the ribs renders it lefs perceptible ; ;and, inftead of raifing the fibres fixed to the flernum and I fpine, would have deprtlTed the ribs. ' N. B. The portions of the external intercoflals which arlfe I from the tranfverfe procefTes of the vertebrae where the ribs tare fixed to them, and other portions that pals over one rib .and terminate in the next below it, Albinus calls Levatores ccojhrum longtores et breviores. The portions of the internal that pafs over one rib, and are iinferted into the next below it, are by Douglas called, Cojla^ t rum depreJJ'ores proprii Coivperit. Thefe portions of both rows affifl; in raifing the ribs in the {fame manner as the reft of the intercoftais. Supra coJJaleSy and Infra cojiales, Winflow. The mufcles within the> thorax are one pair, viz. Triangularis, or Sternocostalis, Arifes^ flcfhy, and a little tendinous, from all the length of tthe cartilago enfiformis laterally, and from the edge of the I'lower half of the middle bone of the fternum, from whence jits fibres afeend obliquely upwards and outwards. Inferted, generally by three triangular terminations, into tthe lower edge of the cartilages of the third,, fourth, and ffifth ribs, near where thefe join with the ribs. r 2 ' lTf(,

BONES OF THE TRUNK. >47 Chap. II. have fome particular dKTerences, which oblige us to confider -them feparateJy. The firft, from its ufe of fupporting the liead, has the name of atlas (y); and is alfo called epijirophea from the motion it performs on the fecond. The atlas, confrary to all the other vertebrae of the fpine, ^ has no body; but, inftead of it, there is a bony arch. In the convex fore-part of this arch a fmall riling appears, where the mufcull longl colli are inferted ; and, on eacli fide of this protuberance, a fmall cavity may be obferved, where the re£li interni minores take their rife. The upper and lower parts of the arch are rough and unequal, where the ligaments that connect this vertebra to the ms occipitis, and to the fecond vertebra, are fixed.——The back-part of the arch is concave, fmooth, and covered with a- cartilage, in a recent fubje£I, to receive the tooth- like projcefs of the fecond vertebra. In a firft vertebra, from which the fecond has been feparated, this, hollow makes the palFage for the fpinal marrow -to feem much larger than it really is : On each fide of It a fmall rough fmuofity may be remarked, where the ligaments going to the fides of the tooth-like procefs of the following verte- bra are faflened ; and on each fide a fmall rough protube- rance and depreffion is obfervable, where the traufverfe liga- ment, which fecures the tooth-like procefs in tlie finuofity, is fixed, and hinders that procefs from injuring the medulla fpinals in the fledlions of the head. ' The atlas has as little fpinal procefs as body; but Inflcad of it, there is a large bony arch, that the mufcles which pafs over this vertebra at that place might not be hurt in extending the head. On the back and upper part of this arch there are two deprelTions, where the re£ti poftici mi- nores take their rife; and at the lower part ar^ two other T 2 finuofities, Cy) I

OF MUSCULAR MOTION. 375 PartU. caufe of the obfcurlty in underftanding how a fraall fofc portion of flefli, can produce fuch ftrong and ample mo- tions as we fee in man, and more efpecially in the crufta- Cfous infefts. t In every mufcle we meet with long foft threads of fibreSy fomewhat elaftic, or extenfible, and almoft conftantly dif- pofed parallel with each other; and thefe,â€™'being furround- ed with a good deal of cellular fubllafrce, are by that fallened together into little bundles, called lacertitli; which \ are again tied together into larger bundles, by a more loofe cellular net-work, that contains fome fat; and between thefe we conftantly perceive membranous partitions and ftripes of the cellular fubftance removing them farther from .each other, till at laft a number of them combined together, either parallel or inclined, are furrounded with a more thin and denfe cellular membrane, continuous with that of their partitions; and this being again furrounded by a thicker plate of the cellular fubftance, parts the whole bundle from the adjacent flefti, and gives it the denomina- tionl of a fttigle or entire mufcle. In every one of thefe threads there appears a lefler feries of filaments, which, by oblique extremities, are cemented to others of the fame kind, forming together a large fibre *. The generality of the ipufclts but more efpecially tliofe which are inferted into the bones, have other fibres fixed to them; but thefe arc condenfed into a more flendcr,- hard, and fhining fubftance, of a filver colour, which has the name of tendon. When the tendinous fibres expand into a broad flat furface, they form what is called an apo- * Swammerdam, Lyonet, arid Roefcl, have elegantly painted the appear- ance of the mufcular fibres in frogs,^and other animals, which Lceuwcnhocck' Cowper, and Muyfs, -have (hewn in man. But their firufture is more par- ticularly deferibed and delineated in a fmall work by Profchalka, Dc OT/j'fi//<?n,publi(l)edat Vienna 1778.

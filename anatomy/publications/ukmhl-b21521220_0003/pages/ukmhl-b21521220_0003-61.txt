Chap. I. IN GENERAL. 19 principal ufe is to convey and fecern this oily matter. Af- ter thefe arteries have pierced the folid fide of a bone, they are divided into fevcral branches ; whicli are foon diftributed every where on the internal periofleum, and aftervi'ai^ds fpread their branches inwards on the medullary cells, and outwards through the tables of the bone. The blood which remains after the fecretion of the mar- row is returned by proper veins, which are collcdltd from the membranes into one or more large trunks, to pafs out at the fame holes or paflagcs at which the artery or arteries enter. The general rule of the fmall vefiTcls decreafing in their capacities as animals advance in age, to which many phe- nomena in the animal oeconomy are owing, obtains here: for though the trunks of the medullary vefl’els enlarge as animals turn older, yet the fmall branches become fmaller ; as is evident from injedfions, which cannot be made to pafs near fo far in thefe veflels of adults as of children. Hence the marrow is bloody in children, oily and balmy in middle age, and thin and watery in old people. By experiments made on the marrow when bones of li- ving animals are opened or cut through (c), and from the racking pain with which fuppurations within bones are fre- quently attended, we have fulTicient proof that the mem- branes here are fenfible, and confequently have nerves diftributed to them. Hippocrates (</) might therefore fay juftly, that a wound penetrating into the cavity of a bone may produce a delirium. The veffels of the marrow, wrapt up in one common coat from the periofteum, pafs through the bones by proper canals; the meft confiderable of which are about tite mid- dle of each bone, and are very oblique.

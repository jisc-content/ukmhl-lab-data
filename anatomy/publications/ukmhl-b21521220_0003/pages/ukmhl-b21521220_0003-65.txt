23 IN GENERAL. OH()p. I. have the fame effeiR In refifting any power applied to break them, as if the fum of all their forces was united in the refpe£tive centres of the tranfverfe feftions where the frac- tures are to be made. For, by hypothefis, the fibres be- ing uniformly difpofed in each, there is not any fibre in either bone that has not a correfponding fibre ; the fum of both whofe diftances from the axis of revolution (about which all the parts of the bone mull revolve in breaking) is equal to two femi-diameters of the bone : confequently each fibre, and ail the fibres, may be regarded as refifting at the diftance of one femi-diameter or radius from this axis, that is, in the centre. 3. Since the united force of all the fibres is to be regarded as refifting at a diftance from the centre of motion equal to the femidiameter, it follows that the total refiftance of all thefe fibres, or the ftrength of the bone is proportional to its femi-diameter, and confequently to its diameter. I have here taken for an example one of the moft finapic cafes for calculating the proportional forces of bones. But, were it not too foreign to the prefent defign, it might be univerfally demonftrated, that of whatever figure bones are, and in whatever manner their fibres are difpofed, their ftrength mlift always be in a ratio, compounded of the area of their tranfverfe fedfions, or,of their quantity of bony matter, and of the diftance of the centre of gravity of thefe fefUons from the centre of motion or fulcrum, on which the bone is fuppofed to be broken \g). Since, therefore, the ftrength of bones depends on their number of fibres, or quantity of matter, and the largenefs of their diameters, one may conclude, that the part of a bone formerly fradured, and reunited by a callusy muft be ftronger than it was before the fradure happened •, becaufe both (^) See the demonftration of this theorem by Dr Porterfield in the Edin- burgh medical clTays, vol. i. art. 10.

Part I, 104 OF THE SKELETON. tilages I OSSA NASI. Ossa nas^, fo named frdiYi their filuation at the root of the nofe, are each of an irregular oblong fquare figure, being broadefl; at their lower end, narrowed a little higher than their middle, and becoming fomewhat larger at tlic top, where they are ragged and thicked, and have a cur-, vature forwards, that their connexion with the frontal hone might be dronger Thcfe bones are convex exter- nally, and thereby better refid any violence from without j and they are concave internally, for enlarging the cavity of the nofe. The lower edge of thefe bones is unequal, and is dretch- cd outwards and backwards, to join the cartilages of the nodrils.—Their anterior fide Is thick, efpecially above, and unequal, that their conjunftion to each other might be ftronger •, and a fmall rifing may be remarked on their in- ner edge, where they are fudained by the feptum narium, —Their poderior fide, at its upper half, has externally a depredion, where it is a little overlapped by the maxillary bones, while its lower half covers thefe bones : By which contrivance, they do not yield eafily to prefliire applied to their fore-part or fides. A fniall bole is frequently to be obferved on their external furface, into which two,, three, or four holes, which appear internally, terminate for the ttanfmifllon of fmall veins : fometimes tire holes go on farther than the cancelli of the bones. ' The nafal bones are firm and folid, with very few cells of cancelli in them ; the thin fubdance of which they con- fid not requiring much marrow. They are joined above to the frontal bone, by the mid- ^ die of the tranfverfe future; behind, fo the maxillary bones, by the lateral nafal futures} below, to the car-

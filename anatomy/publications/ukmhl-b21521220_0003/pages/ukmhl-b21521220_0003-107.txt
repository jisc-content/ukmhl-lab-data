Chap. rr. BONES OF THE HEAD. 65 the fmaller part has procefTes, and depreflions, which make it of an irregular figure. The external furface of the os frontis is fmooth at its up- per convex part; but feveral procetTes and cavities are ob- fervable below; for at each angle of each orbit, the bone juts out to form four procefles, two internal, and as many cxtetnal; which, from this fituation, may well enough be named angular. Between the internal and external angu- lar procefies on each fide, an arched ridge is extended, on which the eye-brows are placed. Very little above the internal end of each of thefe fuperciliary ridges a protuhe- rance may be remarked, in mofl; ficulls, where there are large cavities, called finuft’s, within the bone; of which hereafter.—Between the internal angular procefies a fmall procefs rifes, which forms a fmall part of the nofe, and thence is named nafah Some obferve a protuberant part on the edge of the bone behind each external angular 'procefs, which they call temporal procefles j but thefe arc inconfiderable. From the unejer part of the fupetci- liary ridges, the frontal bone runs a great way backwards; thefe parts may juftly enough be called orbitar procefles, which, contrary to the reft of this bone, are concave externally, for receiving the globes of the eyes, with their mufcles, fat, &c. In each of the orbitar procefies, behind the middle of the fuperciliary ridges, a cOiifiderablc finuofity is obferved, where the glandula innominata Galeni, or lacrymalis, is lodged. Behind each internal angular procefs, a fmall pit may be remarked, where the cartilaginous pully of the nufculus cbliquus major of the eye is fixed.—Between the two orbitar procefles, there Is a large dlfcontinuation of the bone, in which the cribriform part of the 03 ethmoides is Incafed.——The frontal bone has frequently little ca- verns formed in it where it is joined to the ethmoid bone. ^ I. ■ I —Behind

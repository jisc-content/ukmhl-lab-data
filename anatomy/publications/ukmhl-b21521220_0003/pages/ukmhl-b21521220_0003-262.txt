Part I, OF THE SKELETON. 220 metacarpus. FIetacarpus {1) confifts of four bones which fuflain the fingers. Each bone is long and round, with its ends larger than its body. The upper end, which fome call the bafe, ' is flat and oblong, without any confiderablc head or cavity ; but it is however fomewhat hollowed, for the articulation with the carpus: It is made flat and fmooth on the fides where thefe bones are contiguous to each other. Their bodies are flatted on their back-part by the tendons of the extenfors of the fingers. The anterior furface of thefe bodies is a little concave, efpeciidly in their middle \ along which a fliarp ridge Hands out, feparating the mufculi interolTei placed on each fide of thefe bones, which are there made ‘flat and plain by thefe mufcles. Their lower ends are raifed into large oblong fmooth heads, whofe greatefl extent is forwards from the axis of the bone. At the fore-part of each fide of the root of each of thefe heads, one or two tubercles Hand out, ‘ for fixing the ligaments that go from one metacarpal bone to ano- ther, to preferve them from being drawn afunder : Rouhd the heads a rough ring may be remarked, for the capfular ligaments of the firH joints of the fingers to be fixed to; and both fides of thefe heads are flat, by prefling on each o- ther. The fuhjlance of the metacarpal bones is the fame with that of all long bones. At the time of birth, thefe bones are cartilaginous at both ends, which afterwards become epiphyfes. The* metacarpal bones are jained above to the ofla carpi and to each other by nearly plain furfaces.

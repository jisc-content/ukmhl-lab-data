Part r. 126 OF THE SKELETON. bones Intimately unite.—In each of thefe bones there are five or fix fockets for teeth, as in the upper jaw. After I have thus deferibe^ the incafement of the teeth ; .the infertion of fo many mufcles of the tongue, and of the os hyoides; the connection of the membrane of the tongue to the maxillary bone, and the motions of this bone ; it is eafy to fee, that the lower jaw mull be a principal inftru- ment in manducation, deglutition, and fpeech. T H E T E E T H. The teeth are the hard white bodies placed in the fock- ets of both jaws. Their number is generally fixteen above and as many below; though fame people have more, others have fewer. The broad thick part of each tooth which appears with- out the focket, is the bafe or body (y).—The fmaller pro- cefles funk into the maxillae, are tlie roots or fangs ; which become gradually fmaller towards the end fartheft from the bafe, or are nearly conical; by which the furface of their fides divides the preflure made on the bafes, to prevent the foft parts, which are ar the fmall points of the fockets, to be hurt by fuch prelTure. At the place where the bafe en^s and the roots begin, there is generally a fmall circular depref- 'm Con, v/hich fome call the neck or collar. ! Without the grums the teeth are covered with no mem'» i- *= 1 Wane, and they are faid to have no proper pcrlolleum j| within the fockets; but that is fupplied by the reflected d membrane of the gums, which after a good inje£lion may i be evidently feen in a young fubje£lr, with the veflels from j/ it penetrating into the fubflance of the teeth ; and it may be difeovered in any tooth recently pulled, by macerating || It in water (2;).

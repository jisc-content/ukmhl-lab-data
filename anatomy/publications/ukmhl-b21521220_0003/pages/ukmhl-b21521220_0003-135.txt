' Chap. II. 93 BONES OF THE HEAD. OS SPHENOIDES. Os SPHENOIDES (z), Or iijedge-lihe bone, fo called be- \ Caufe of its fituation in the middle of the bones of the cra- nium and face, is of fuch an irregular figure, that I know not any thing to which it may be compared, unlefs, per- haps, it bear fome faint refemblance to a bat with its wings extended. When we view the external furface of the os fphenoides,k two or three remarkable procefles from each fide of it may be obfcrved, which are all of them again fubdivided. The firft pair is the two large lateral procefles or wings; the upper part of each of which is called the temporal pro- cefsy becaufe they join with the temporal bones in forming the temples, und the feat for fome fliare of the crotaphite mufcles. That part of the wings which juts out towards the infide, fomewhat lower than the temporal apophyfes, and is fmooth and hollowed, where it makes up part of the orbit, isj thence named orbitar procejfes. Behind the edge feparating thefe two procefles, there is often a fmall groove, made by a branch of the fuperior maxillary nerve, in its paflage to the temporal mufcle. The Iqwefl; and back part of each ^wing, which runs out fliarp to meet the ofTa petrofa, has been ftyled the fpinous procefs : from near tl^e point of which a fharp-pointed procefs is frecjuently produ- ced downwards, commonly called Jlyliform^ that affords ori- gin to the ptery-ftaphylinus externus mufcle. From this ftyloid procefs a very fmall groove is extended along the edge of the bone to the hollow at the root of the internal plate of the following procefles, which forms, part of the Euflachian (z) Cuneiforme, re\vfiopfov, multifopme, paxillum, cribratum palati, cox Igtorii, cavilla, baliUre.

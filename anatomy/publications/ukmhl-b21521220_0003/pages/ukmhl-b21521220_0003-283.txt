At the ordinary time of birth, the rotula is entirely cartila- ginous, and fcarcely aflumes a bony nature fo foon as moft cpiphyfes do. Tlie parts which conftitute the joint of the knee being now defcribed, let us examine what are its motions, and how^they are performed. The two principal motions are flexion and extenfion. In the former of thefe^ the leg may be brought to a very acute angle with the thigh, by the con- dyles of the thigh-bones being round and made fmboth far backwards. In performing this, the rotula is pulled down by the tibia. When the leg is to be extended, the rotula is drawn upwards, eonfequently the tibia forwards, by the extenfor mufcles; which, by means of the protuberant joint, and of this thick bone w'ith its ligament, ^have the chord, with which they adl, fixed to the tibia at a confiderable angle, acl, on that account, with advantage ; but they are reftrained from pulling the leg farther than to a ftralght line with the thigh, by the pofterior part of the crofs li- gament, that the body might be fupported by a firm per- pendicular colurrm : For at this time the thigh and leg are as little moveable in a rotatory way, or to either fide, as if they werei one continued bone. But when the joint is a little bent, the rotula is not tightly braced, and the poflerior ligament is relaxed ; therefore this bone may be moved a little to either fide, or with a fmall rotation in the fuperficial cavities of the tibia; which is done by the motion of the external cavity backwards and forwards, the internal ferving as a fort of axis (r). Seeing, then, one part of the crofs ligament is fituated perpendicularly, VoL. I. II h and (r) Pare, liv. 15. 32. (r) Winflow, Expofition anatomique tlu corps humaln. traite ies os fees S 976.

152 Part I. OF THE SKELETON. on its fore-part a middle ridge, and two oblong cavities, for the ofla fefamoidea ; and on the external fide a depreflion is made by the following bone. Os metatarft of the fecond toe, is the longell-of the five, with a triangular bafe fupported by the os cuneiforme me- dium and the external fide produced into a procefs ; the end of which is an oblique fmooth plane, joined to the os cuneiforme externum. Near the internal edge of the bafe, this bone ha.s two fmall deprelfions, made by the os cuneiforme maximum, between which is a rough cavity. ——Farther forwards we may obferve a fmooth protuberance, which is joined to the foregoing bone. On the outfide of the bafe are two oblong fmooth furfaces, for its articulation with the following bone ; the fuperior fmooth furface being extended longitudinally, and the inferior perpendicularly ; •between which there is a rough folTa. Os metaiarfi of the middle toe, is the fecond in length.——— Its bafe, fupported by the os cuneiforme externum, is trian-: gular, but flanting outwards, where it ends in a fltarp- pointed little procefs ; and the angle below is not comple- ted. The internal fide of this bafe is adapted to the 'preceding bone j and the external fide has alfo two fmooth furfaces covered with cartilage, but of a different figure ; for the up- per one is concave, and being round behind, turns fmaller as it advances forwards ; and the lower furface is little, fmooth, convex, and very near the edge of the bafe. Os metatarft of the fourth toe, is near as long as the for- mer, with a triangular flanting bafe joined to the os cu- boides, and made round at its external angle ; having one ' hollow fmooth furface on the outfide, where it is preffed upon by the following bone ; and two on the internal fide, correfponding to the former bone ; behind which is a long narrow furface imprefled by the os cuneiforme externurti.

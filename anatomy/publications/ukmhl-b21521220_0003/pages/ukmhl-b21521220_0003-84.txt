OF THE LIGAMENTS. : ■ f; Ligaments (r) are white flexible bodies, thicker and firmer than membranes, and not fo ’hard or firm as cartila- ges, without any remarkable'cavity in their fubftance, difli* cultly flretched, and with little elaflicity ; ferving to conne£l one part to another, or to prevent the parts to which they are fixed from being removed out of that fituation which is ufeful and fafe.- After maceration in water, the ligaments can eafily be divided; and each ligamentous layer appears compofed of fibres, the largeft of which are difpofed in a longitudinal dire£lion. . r. . n The arteries of ligaments are very confpicuous after a ; tolerable injeclion, and the larger trunks of their veins iare j fometimes to be feen full of blood. . Such liga,ments as form the Tides of cavities, have nu- ! merous orifices of their arteries opening upon their inter- i nal furface, which keep it alw.ays moift. If we rub off that rnoifture, and tlien prefs the ligament, we can fee the i liquor oozing out from fmallpores; and we can force thin I liquors inje£led by the arteries into the cavities formed by : ligaments. d Thefe exhalent arteries muft have correfponding abfor- i bents, otherwlfe the cavities would foon be too full of liquor. 1 Ligaments, then, nruft be fubjeeft to the difeafes com- i mon to other parts, where there is a circulation of fluids, t allowance ; (»■) 'Sir/Sto-ftoiy eopulaB, vincula.

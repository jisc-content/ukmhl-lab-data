TO THE MEDICAL SOCIETY. Gentlemen, i I Embrace this opportunity of exprcfUng my gratitude for the many favours I have received from you, both in your col- Itftive and individual capacity; but I am unwilling to offend* cither by encomiums on the utility of your inllitution, or by ex- hibiting the private friendfhips with which I have been honoured by many of your number. In compliance with your felicitations, I lately publiflied a fhort Defeription of the Human Mufcles, which has been fortunate enough to receive your approbation. It was, however, your o- pinion, that a fet of Tables would render the deferiptiona ftill more perfeft and ufeful. 1 have, therefore, caufed the following plates to be engraved ; and 1 hope they will not altogether dif- appolnt your expeftations. The Tables of Alblnus, though accurate and complete, arc not, perhaps, on account of their fize, the prolixity of the deferiptions, and the number of references, fo fully fuited to the purpofes of private difTeftion as could be wifhed. To remedy this inconvenience, I have copied eight of Albinus’s tables on a fmaller fcale. Two of them contain a fore and back view of the flceleton ; and the otlver fix are reprefentatlons of the mufcles. To each plate I have prefixed an explanation ; and I have a- Toided, as much as was confillent with perfpiculty, loading the figures with an unnecefTary quantity of referring letters. For this purpofe,’ I have all along made ufe of one alphabet only. To prevent the defacing of the mufcles, and to enable the lear- ner to diltinguifh them without the affiftance of references, the figuies are only lettered on one fide. If this little woik be of ufe in facilitating your anatomical ftu- dies, it will give the greateft pleafure to, Gentlemen, Your very much obliged humble fervant, and Fellow-member, JOHN IN N E S.

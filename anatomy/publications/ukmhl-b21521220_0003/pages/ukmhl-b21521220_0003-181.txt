Between the bodies of each two adjoining vertebrtc, a fubftance between the nature of ligament and cartilage is interpofed; which feems to confift of concentrical curved fibres, when it is cut horizonally; but when it is divi- ded perpendicularly, the fibres appear oblique and decuf- fating each other (k) The outer part of the invertebral ligaments is the moll folid and hard, and they gradually become fofter till they are almoft in the form of a glairy^ liquor in the centre; and therefore thefe fubftances were not improperly called mucous ligaments by the antients (/)• The external fibrous part of each is capable of being great- ly extended, and of being comprefled into a very fmall fpace, while the middle fluid part is incompreffible, or nearly fo; and the parts of this ligament between the cir- cumference and centre approach in their properties to each other, in proportion to their more folid or more fluid tex- ture. The middle point is therefore a fulcrum or pivot, on which the motion of a ball and focket may be made, with fuch a gradual yielding of the fubftance of the ligament, in whatever diredflon our fpines are moved, as faves the body from violent fliocks, and their dangerous confequen- ces (m). This ligamento-cartilaginous fubftance is firm- ly fixed to the horizontal furfaces of the bodies of the ver- tebrae, to conne£l them; in which it is alTifted by a ftrong membranous ligament, which lines all their concave fur- face, and by a ftill ftronger ligament that covers all their anterior convex furface.

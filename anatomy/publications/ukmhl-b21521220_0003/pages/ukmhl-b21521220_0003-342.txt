OF THE MUSCLES where feme of its fibres are continued with thofe of the diaphragm and the intercoftal mufcles; by a ^^road thin tendon, connefted ,to the tranfverfe procefles of the laft vertebra of the back and the four fuperior vertebra of the loins t flefhy, from the whole fpine of the os ilium inter- nally, and from the tendon of the external oblique mufcle, where it intermixes with fome fibres of the internal ob- lique. Inferted into the cartilago enfiformis, and into the whole length of the linea alba, excepting its lowermoll part. Ufe.

Inferted into the cartilages of the three inferior true ribs, and often intermixed with fome fibres of the pe£loral muf- cle. It is generally divided by three tendinous interfedlions; the firft is at the umbilicus, the fecond where it runs over the cartilage of the feventh rib, and the third in the middle between thefe; and there is commonly a half In- terfe£lion below the umbilicus: Thefe interfe<rkions feldom penetrate through the whole thicknefs of the mufcle; they adhere firmly to the anterior part of the (heath, but very (lightly to the pofterior layer.

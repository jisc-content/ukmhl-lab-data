Chap, II. INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 245 efpecially on the upper furface, a rough fofla may be re- niaikecl, 1 The aftragalus is articulated above to the tibia and fibu- hi, which together form one cavity. Though in this iirti- culation the bones have prominences and cavities, fo fmall as might allow motions in all directions, yet the flexion and extenfion are the mofl: conllderable, the other motions be- ing confined by the malleoli, and, by the ftrong ligaments which go out from the points pf thefe proceiTes, to the a- ftragalus and os calcis. When the foot is bent, fo far as it commonly is when we ftand, no lateral or rotatory motion is allowed in this joint; for then the head of the qftragalus is funk deep between the malleoli, and the liga- ments are tenfe ; but when the foot is extended, the aflra- galus can move a little to either fide, and with a fmall ro- tation. By this contrivance the foot is firm, when the weight of the body is to be fupported on it; and when a foot is raifed, we are at liberty to direCt it more exaCUy to the place we intend next to ftep upon. The aftragalus is joined below to the os calcis ; and before to the os navlcu- lare, in the rnanner to be explained when thefe bones are de- feribed. A confiderable (bare of this bone is oflified in a new-born Infant. Calcaneum (w) is the largeft bone of the feven. Be- hind, it is formed into a large knob, commoly called the h(el: the furface of which is rough behind, where the ten- do Achillls Is iqferted ; and above that part it is hollow and fpongy. Farther forwards, on the upper furface of the calcaneum, there is an irregular oblong fmooth convexity^ adapted to the concavity at the back-part of the aftragalus: and beyond this a narrow folTa is feen, which divides it from two fmall concave fmooth furfaces, that are joined to (w) Os calcis, irreftK, calcar pedis.

22i( OF THE SKELETOt^. Part I. only it Is fomewhat more confined, and lefs expeditious, but ftronger and more fecure than fuch joints generally are. This bone in children in the fame ftate with the meta- carpal bones. The fecond bone of the thumb has a large bafe formed into an oblong cavity, whofe greateft length is from one fide to the other. Round it feveral tubercles may be re- marked, for the infertion of ligaments. Its body is con- vex, or a half-round behind •, but fliit before, for lodging the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, which is tied down by ligamentous flieaths that are fixed on each fide to the angle at the edge of this flat furiace. The lower end of this 'fecond bone has two lateral^ round protuberances, and a middle cavity, whofe greateft extent of fmooth furface is forwards. The articulation and motion of the upper end of this fe- cond bone is as Angular as that of the former.-:—For its ca- vity being joined to the round head of the firft bone, it would feem to enjoy motion in all directions; yet, becaufe of the ftrength of its lateral ligaments, oblong figure of the joint itfelf, and mobility of the firft joint, it only allows flexion and extenfion ; and thefe are generally much confin- ed. The third bone of the thumb is the fmalleft, with a large bafe, whofe greateft extent is from one fide to the other. This bafe is formed into two cavities and a middle pro- tuberance, to be adapted to the pulley of the former bone. Its body is rounded behind *, but is flatter than in the former bone for fuftaining the nail..—It is flat and rough before, by the infertion of the, flexor tertii internodii. This bone becomes gradually fmaller, till near the lower end, where it is a little enlarged, and has an oval fcabrous edge. The

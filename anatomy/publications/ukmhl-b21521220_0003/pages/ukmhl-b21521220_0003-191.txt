BONES O F THE TRUNK. j Chap. ir. 149 appears, that very little motion cart here be allowed to ei- ther fide ; and there mud be ftill lefs circular motion. In new born children this vertebra has only the two la- teral pieces ofhfied ; the arch, which it has at its fore-pait indead of a body, being cartilaginous. The fecond vertebra colli is called dentaia, from the footh-like procefs on the upper part of its body. Some au- thors call it epiflrophea ; but improperly, fince this defignatiou is only applicable to the fird, which moves on this as on an axis. The body of this vertebra is fomewhat of a pyranndal figure, being large, and produced downwards, efpecially at its fore-fide, to enter Into a hollow of the vertebra be- low ; while the upper part has a fquare procefs, with a fmall point danding out from ir, This It is that is imagin- ed to refemble a tooth (z), and has given name to the ver- tebra.—The fide of this procefs, on which the hollow of the anterior arch of the fird vertebra plays, is convex, fmooth, and covered with a cartnlage ; and it is of the fame form behind, for the ligament, which is extended tranf- verfely from One rough protuberance of the fird vertebra, to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it.—A ligament likewife goes out in an oblique tranf- ' verfe diredbion, from each fide of the procefius dentatus, ' to be fixed at its other end to the fird vertebra, and to the occipital bone ; and another ligament rifes up from near the point of the procefs to the os occipitis. The fuperior oblique procefles of this vertebra dentata are large, circular, very nearly in an horizontal pofition, and flightly convex, to be adapted to the inferior oblique pro- cefles of the fird vertebra.—A moveable cartilage is faid by 'fome authors to be interpofed between thefe oblique pro- CcflTes of the fird and fecond vertebra j but I could never find Conoidcs, pyrenoides, odonto'ul<^.

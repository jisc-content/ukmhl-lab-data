BONES OF THE HEAD. Chap. II. 105 tllages of the nofe;—before, to one another, by the anterior nafal future;—internally, to the feptum narlum. The life of thefe bones is to cover and defend the Voot of the nofe. In an infant the nafal bones are proportionally ftiorter, and lefs thick at their upper part, than in an adult; but are Otherwifc complete. OSSA UNGUIS, OR LACRYMALIA. Ossa unguis, or lacrymalia, are fo named, becaufe their figure and magnitude are nearly like thofe of a nail of one’s finger, and becaufe the tears pafs upon them into the nofe. Their external furface is compofed of two fmooth conca- vities and a middle ridge. The deprejfion behind forms a fmall fhare of the orbit for the eye-ball to move on j and the one before is a deep perpendicular canal, or fojfa^ larger above than below, containing part of the lacrymal fac and duft. This is the part that ought to be pierced in the great operation for the fiftula lacrymalis.- This folTa of the bone is cribriform, or has a great number of fmall holes through it, that the filaments for the membrane which lines it, infi- nuating themfelves into thefe holes, might prevent a fepara- tion of the membrane, and fecure the bone in its natural fi- tuation. The ridge between thefe two cavities of the 09 unguis is the proper boundary of the orbit at its internal can- thus 5 and beyond which furgeons Ihould not proceed back- wards In performing operations here The internal or po- fterior furface of this bone confifts of a furrow in the middle of two convexities. The fubjlance of the os unguis is as thin as paper, and very brittle j which is the reafon that thofe bones are often Voj.. f. O wanting

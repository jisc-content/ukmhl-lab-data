SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 219 to the fecurity and eafinefs of which, the reception of the os magnum into the cavity formed by the fcapholdes and lunare confiderably contributes: And the greateft number of the mufcles that ferve for the motion of the wrlft on the radius, being inferted beyond the conjun£Hon of the firfl; row of bones with the fecond, a£f equally on this ar- ticulation as they do on fiie former ; but the joint formed* with the radius being the moll eafily moved, the firft elFefl of thefe mufcles is on it; and the fecond row of the car- pus is only moved afterwards. By this means a larger mo- tion of the wrifl is allowed than otherwife it could have had fafely: for if as large motion had been given to one joint, the angle of flexion would have been very acute, and the ligaments mufl have been longer than was con- fiftent with the lirmnefs and fecurity of the joint. The other articulations of the bones here being by nearly plain furfaces, fcarcely allow of any more motion, becaufe of the ftrong connedting ligaments, than to yield a little, and fp elude the force of any external power ; and to render the back of the wrifl a little more flat, or the palm more hol- low, on proper occaflons. The articulations of the thumb and metacarpal bones fhall be e.xamined afterwards. The ufes of’the carpus are to ferve as a bafe to the luind, to protedl its tendons, and to afford it a free large motion. All the bones of Uie carpus are in a cartilaginous date at the time of birth. On account of the many tendons that pafs upon the lower end of the fore-arm and the carpus, and of the numerous ligaments of thefe tendons and of the bones, which have lubricating liquors fupplied to them, the pain of fprains here is acute, the parts take a long time to recover their tone, and their fwellings are very obflinate.

The clavicle, as well as other long round bones, is larger at its two ends than in the middle. The end next to the fternunri {m) is triangular : The angle behind is confider- ably protruded, to form a fliarp ridge, to which the tranf- verfe ligament^ extended from one clavicle to the other, is fixed (w). The fide oppofite to this is fomewhat round- ed. The middle of this protuberant end is as irregularly hollowed as the cavity in the fternum for receiving it is raifed : but, in a recent fubje£l, the irregular concavities of both are fupplied by a moveable cartilage*, which is not only much more clofely connetfted every where by liga- ments to the circumference of the articulation than thofe of the lower jaw arc, but it grows to the two bones at both its internal and external end ; its fubftance at the external end being foft, but Very ftrong, and refembling the intervertebral cartilages (0). From this' internal end, the clavicle, for about two fifths of its length, is bended obliquely forwards and down- wards. On the upper and fore-part of this curvature a fmall ridge is feen, with a plain rough furface before it 5 vvhence the mufculus fterno-hyoideus and fterno-maftoi-. deus have in part their origin. Near the lower angle a fmall plain furface is often to be remarked, where the firft nb and this bone are contiguous (/>), and are connec- ted by a firm ligament (q). From this a rough plain fur- VoL.

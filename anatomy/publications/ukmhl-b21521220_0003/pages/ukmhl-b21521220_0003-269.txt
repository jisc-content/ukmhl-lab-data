tchap. ir. INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 227 § I. ^he Thigh. The thigh (^) has only one bone; which is the longefi; In the whole body, and the largeft and (Irongefl; of any of the cylindrical bones. The fituation of it is not perpendicular; for the lower end Is Inclined confiderably inwards ; fo that thti knees are almofl: contiguous, while tliere is a confiderable dillance between the thigh-bones above; which is of great ufe, fince fuflicient fpace is thereby left for the external parts of generation, the two great clOacie of urine and faeces, and for the large thick mufcles that move the thigh inwards. At the fame time this fituati*^ of the thigh bones renders our progreffion quicker, furer, ftraighter, and In lefs room ; for, had the knees been at a greater diftance from each other, we mull have been obliged to deferibe fome part of a circle with the trunk of our body in ma- king a long Ilep ; and when one leg was raifed from the ground, our centre of gravity would have been too far from the bafe of the other, and we Ihould confequently have been in danger of falling ; fo that our fteps would neither have been ftraight nor firm, nor would it have been poflible to walk in a narrow path, had our thigh-bones been otherwife placed. In confequence, however, of the weight of the body bearing fo obliquely on the joint of the knee by this fituation of the thigh-bones, weak ricketty children become inn-knee’d. The upper end of the thigh-bone is not continued In a ftraight line with the body of it, but is fet off obliquely in- wards and upwards, whereby the diftance here between thefe two bones at their upper part is confiderably increa- fed. This end is formed into a large fmooth round head (z), which is the greater portion of a fphere unequal- ly divided Towards its lower internal part a round F f 2 rough (ji) Ml),Of, Femen, coxa, agis, anchse o$, cru5, femur.

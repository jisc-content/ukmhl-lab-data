384 Part IL SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. the mufcle fo as to excite it into action, feems not to be the foul, but a law derived immediately from God. For ani- mals newly born, or newly transformed, without any at- tempt, or exercife, know how to execute compound mo- tions, very difficultly to be defined by calculation j whereas the foul knows not how to perform any actions until flie lias learnt, by making experiments, the methods of per- forming them. A mufcle then is contracted when in a given time it receives more of the nervous fluid, whether that be occafioned by the will, or by fome irritating caufe ftrifing in the brain, or applied to the nerve. But though w'e may fuppofe the foul to be the caufe of the nervous motion, we cannot do the fame with regard to that arifing from the vis infita. The heart and intef- tines, and alfo the organs of generation, are governed by a vis infita, and by flimuli. Thefe powers do not arife from the will; nor are they lelTened, or excited, or fup- prefied, or changed by it. No cufliom nor art can make thefe organs fubjecl to the will, which have their motions from a vis infita; nor can they be made to obey the com- mands of the foul, like attendants on voluntary motion. It is fo certain that motion is produced by the body alone, that we cannot even fufpecl any motion to arife from a fpi- ritual caufe, befides that which wâ€™e fee is occafioned by the will; and, even in that motion wdiich is occafioned by the will, a flimulus will cccafion the greateft exertions, when the mind is very unwilling. There feems to be this difference between the mufcles o- beying the will, and thofe which are governed by a vis infi- ta ; namely, that the latter, being more irritable, are very eafily excited into motion by a gentle flimulus; as for in- ftance, the heart and intellines; which organs are mod manifeflly, and greatly, and conftantly, irritable. On the other hand, the mufcles, which obey the will, are neither endowed

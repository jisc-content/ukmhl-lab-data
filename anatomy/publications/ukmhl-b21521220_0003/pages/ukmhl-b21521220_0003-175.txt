*33 Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. the teeth are more liable, by their fituation, tja fall out (r), the grinders there have more numerous and more fepara- ted roots than in the lower jaw (r). The number, however, of the roots of the teeth of both jaws is very uncertain ; fometimes they are more, fometimes fewer ; frequently fe- veral roots are joined together; at other times they are all diftinft. The difpofitlon of fuch as are diftinfl; is alfo va- ^•ious; for in fome the roots ftand out flraight, in others they feparate, and in others again they are crooked inwards. When the roots are united, we can ftill diftinguifli them, by remarking the number of fmall holes at their points, which determine the number of roots each tooth ought to be reckoned to have. At the time of birth, only two dentes molares in each jaw have begun to olTify; and that at little more than the bafe, which has feveral fharp points Handing out from it. The temporaneous grinders are placed more dlredlly upon the internal fet than the other two clafles are: fometimes there is a piece of the bone of the jaws between the two fets; in other children, the two fets have no bone interpofed be- tween them. From what has been faid, the anfwers to the following queries may be given. Why are children fubjeft to falivation, fever, convulfion, vomiting, purging, &c. when their teeth are breeding or cutting the gums ? Why in children do the dentes inciforcs firft cut the gums, the canini next, and molares lafl; ? AVhy do children flied their teeth ? ^ Why have thefe temporaneous teeth generally no roots, or Very fmall ones ? Why have thefe firft teeth fometimes roots, and that more , (/•) Galen de oflib. cap. 5. (j) Fauchard. Chirurg. dent, chap. I. I

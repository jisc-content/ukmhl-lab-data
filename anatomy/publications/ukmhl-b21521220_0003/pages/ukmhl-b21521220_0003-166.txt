124 OF THE SKELETON./ Parti. expofed to injuries, the folid Tides of it are thick, compaft, and hard. Ihe lower jaw generally receives the root of fixteen teeth into its fockets, by gomphofts; and its condyloid pro- ceflcs covered with a cartilage, are articulated with the tem- poral bones, in a manner that is not commonly right de- fcribed : for, as was already mentioned in the defcription of the temporal bones, not only the fore-part of the cavity between the zygomatic, auditory, and vaginal procefles, but alfo the adjoining tubercle at the root of the zygomatic procefs of each os temporum, is covered with a fmooth cartilage for this articulation. Here alfo an intermediate moveable cartilage is placed ; which being thin in the mid- dle, and thick at the edges, is concave on both (ides i and is connefted fo firmly by ligaments to each condyle, as to follow the motions of the condyle; and fo loofcly to the temporal bone, as readily to change its fituation from the cavity to the tubercle, and to return again; while the common ligament of the articulation affords fpace enough for fuch a change of place backwards and forwards; but like other ligaments of the joints by ginglimus, is ftrong and fhort at the fides, to confine the lateral morions. When, therefore, the teeth of both jaws coincide, the condyles &re lodged fecurely in the temporal cavities; but their motions to either fides muft be confined both by the firmnefs of the ligaments and the rifing brims which are on each fide of the cavities.—When the jaw is brought di- re£Hy forwards, the condyle and intermediate cartilages defccnd and advance forwards upon the tubercles.—In this fituation, the lateral motions are a little more free than in the former one, from the want of rifing brims to flop the icondyles.—When the fore-teeth of the lower jaw are mo- ved forwards and to a fide, the condyle of the oppofije fide is either .advanced from the cavity to the tubercle, while ■ I

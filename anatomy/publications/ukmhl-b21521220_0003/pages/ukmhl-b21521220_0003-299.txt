FEMALE SKELETON. 257 The VoL. I. K k App. The depreJftonSy ride^es, fcahrous furfuces, and other in- equalities made by the mufcleSy are not fo confpicuous in them; becaufe their mtifcles are neither fo thick nor ftrong, nor fo much employed, as to make fo ftrong prints on their bones. The os frontis is more frequently divided by a conti- nuation of the fagittal future ; which depends on the firft and fecond general caufes alTigned above for the fpecial- ties in tli,eir bones, as will appear after refledling on the ac- count given formerly of the middle internal fpine of this bone. Their clavicles are lefs crooked ; becaufe their arms have been lefs forcibly pulled forwards ; which, in our European ■women, efpecially thofe of diftindiion, is more hindered by their garb. Their Jlernum is more raifed by long cartilages belo'W, that the thorax might be there widened in fome proportion to what it is fliortened by the preffure upon the diaphragm when they are with child. The defedl of hone, or the, hole, in the middle of the Jlcrnunty is ofteneft found in them ; to allow the paffage of the mammary veflels, fay fome. But, in my opinion, this is owing to a lax conftitution, by which the oflification is not fo foon completed as in men, where the adlion of the folids is vigorous, and the circulation of the fluids is brifk : for a much fmaller hole might have ferved this purpofe ; and the branches of the Intarnal mammary veflels which are fent to the external parts of the thorax, do not pafs here, but between the cartilages of the ribs, before tiiefe are joined to the fternuni. ‘ The cartilago xiphotdeSy is oftener bifurcated in women than in men, for the reafon afligned in the preceding paragraph, viz. a lefs forcible power of oftification.

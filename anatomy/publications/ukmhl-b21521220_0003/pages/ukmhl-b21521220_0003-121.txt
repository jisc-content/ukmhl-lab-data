Chap.II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 79 The firft, fituated between the zygomatic and maftoid procefles, is the orifice of a large funnel-like canal, which leads to the organ of hearing i and is therefore called wea- tus auditorhis extenms (A).—The fecond gives paflage to the portio dura of the feventh pair of nerves 5 and from its fituation between the mafloid and ftyloid procefles, is called foramnt Jlylo-maflo'ideum (i).-—Some way before, and to the infide of the ftyloid procefs, is'ithe third hole : the canal' from which runs firft upwards, then forwards, and receives into it the interital carotid artery, and the begin- ning of the intercoftal nerve •, where this canal is about to make the turn forwards, one, or fometimes two, very fmall holes go ofF towards the cavity of the ear, called tympa- num : Through thefe Valfalva [k) affirms the proper ar- tery or arteries of that cavity are feiit, On the anterior edge of this bone, near the former, a fourth hole is obfer- ' Table, being the orifice of a canal which runs outwards and backwards, in a horizontal dire£llon, till it terminates in the tympanum. This, in the recent fubjefl:, is conti- nued forward and inward, from the parts which I men- tioned juft now as its orifice in the fkeleton, to the fide of ■the noftrils; being partly cartilaginous, and partly liga- mentous. The whole canal is named her a palato ad eureniy or Eujlachhn tube.—On the external fide of the bony part of this canal, and on the’ top of the chink, in the cavity that receives the condyle, of the lower jaw, is the courfe of the little nerve, called chorda tympaniy and common- ly faid to be reflecSted from the lingual branch of the fifth pair, till it enters the tympanum, to irun acrofs this cavi- ty. The fifth hole is very uncertain, appearing fome- times behind the maftoid procefs; fometimes it is common (A) rio^Mf T»c ajtonf, o»)> TCi'v orav, feneflra aurium.

3^ OF THE BONES. , Part I. fary to retain, fince they ferve to exprefs the various cir* cumftances of the articulations, and to underftand the writers on this fubjeft. The AllTlCULA-TIONS are moft commonly divided into three clafl'cs, viz. Symphyfis, Synarthrofis, and Di* arthrofis. I. Symphysis, which properly fignifies the conception or growing together of parts, when ufed to exprefs the articulations of bones, does not feem to comprehend, un- der the meaning generally given to it, any thing relating to the form or motion of the conjoined bones ; but by it mod authors only denote the bones to be conne£led by fome other fubdance ; and as there are different fubdances which % ferve this purpofe, therefore they divide it into the three following fpecies. 1. ^ynchondrofis («), when a cartilage is the conneftlng fubdance : thus the ribs are joined to the dernum ; thus the bodies of the vertebrae are connedled to each other; as are likewife the offa pubis. 2. Synmurefts or fyndefmeftSy when ligaments are the connedling bodies, as they are in all the moveable articula- tions. 2. Syjfarcoftiy when mufcles are dretched from one bone to another, as they mud be where there are moveable joints. II. The fecond clafs of articulations, the SvNARTtyio- sis, which is faid to be the general term by w'hich the im- moveable conjundlion of bones is expreffed, is divided into I h 1 3 3 5 c three kinds.

Hence they either (land in need of the power of the will, or of a ftronger ftimulus *, when they are excited by a fti- mulus, they are animated to motion againfl the will. Thus it happens, that in apoplexies the mufcles which obey the M'ill languiOi, and become paralytic, as being diftitute or ^11 influx from the brain; while the vital mufcles, having no occafion for the operation of the brain, continue to be excited into contra£Hon by their ftimuli, independent of the will, as the heart by the blood, and the inteftines by the air and aliments. The ftrength of the mufcles is very conflderable in all perfons, but more efpecially phrenetic and robufl; men; fmce frequently, with the ufe of a few mufcles only, they •will raife a weight equal to, or much greater than, that of the whole human body. In a healthy man, very flen- der mufcles fuflice to lift 200 or 300 pounds. The mufcles of the back will even fuflain 3000. Notwithftand- ing this, we fee, that much the greater part of the force or power exerted by a mufcle is always loft without pro- ducing any vlfible efFe£l:. For all the mufcles are infertecl nearer the point or centre of motion, than the weights they are applied to; and therefore their aftlon is weaker, in the fame proportion as they move a fhorter part of the lever than that to which the weight is applied. Moreover, in moft of the bones, efpecially thofe of the limbs, the muf- cles are inferted at very acute angles ; whence again the cfFc£l which a mufcle exerts in aAion is proportionally lefs as the fine of the angle intercepted between the bone and the mufcle is lefs than the whole fine. Again, the half of all mufcular force is loft, becaufc a mufcle, like an extend- ed cord, exerts as much force at its fixed as at its moving extremity. Befides, many of tlie mufcles are feated in the angle of two bones; and when the joint is bent, the mufcle You L 3'C becomes

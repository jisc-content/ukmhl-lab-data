Part I. 133 OF THE SKELETON. what refemhles two unequal pyramids joined in a common bafe. It is not, however, ftraight j for its upper part being drawn backwards by ftrong mufcles, it gradually advances forwards, to fupport the cefophagus, veflels of the head, &c. Then it turns backwards, to make room enough for the heart and lungs. It is next bent forwards, to fupport the vifcera of the abdomen. It afterwards turns backwards, for the en- largement of the pelvis. And, lallly, it is reflected forwards, for fuftaining the lowed great gut. The fpine is commonly divided Into true and falfe vertebra; the former condituting the lon^ upper pyramid, which has its bafe below; while the falfe vertebrae make the diorter lower pyramid, whofe bafe is above. TRUE VERTEBRA. The true vertebrae'(/j) are the twenty-four upper bones of the fpine, on which tlie feveral motions of the trunk of our bodies are performed; from which ufe they have judly got their name. Each of thefe vertebrae Is compofed of its body and pro- celTes. The body Is the thick fpongy fore-part, which is convex before, concave backwards, horizontal and plain in mod of them above and below. Numerous fmall holes, efpe- cially on the fore and back part of their furface, give paf- fage to their vedels, and allow the ligaments to enter their fubdance. The edges of the body of each vertebra are covered, efpeclally at the fore-part, with a ring of bone firmer and more folid than the fubdance of the body any where elfe. Thefe rings feem to be joined to the verte- brae In the form of epiphyfes, but are alledged by fome (4) Srfffflif rfofiyyc!, Spondyli, ofla orbiculata, ofla vertebrata, verticula.

9 Chap. i. IN GENERAL. ter, are generally of a white colour; only in a living crea- ture they are bluifli, which is owing to the blood in the fmall veflTcls under their furface. The lefs therefore and fewer the veflels are, and the thicker and firmer the bony furface covering the veflels is, the bones are whiter. Hence the bones of adults are whiter than thofe of children ; and, in both young and old, the white colour of different bones, or of the feveral parts of the fame bone, is always in pro- portion to their veifels and folidities which circumflances ought to be regarded by furgeons, when they are to judge of the condition of bones laid bare. Bones are compofed of a great many plates (/), each of which Is made up of fibres or firings united by fmaller fi- brils (g); w'hich being irregularly difpofcd, and interwo- ven with the other larger fibres, make a reticular work. This texture is plainly feeii in the bones of foetufes, which have not their parts clofely compacted; and in the bones of adults which have been burnt, long expofed to the weather, or«whofe compofition has been made loofe by dif- eafes.—The chinks which are generally made according to the diredlions of the larger fibres of bones that have un- dergone the adtion of fire or of the weather, fhew the greater ftrength of thefe than of the fibres which connedt them. Numerous accurate obfcrvations of the different times in which exfoliations are made from the fides or ends of fimilar bones, might bid fair to determine what is the pro- , portional force of cohefion in the two forts of fibres. The plates are faid (/j) to be firmly joined to each other by a great fiumber of clavicull, or fmall bony proccffes, which, rifing from the inner plates, pierce through fome, and are fixed into the more external ones.

(Chap. ir. BONES OF THE HEAD. 127 thefe roots is ftrengthened by the fmall furrows obfcrvable on them. Each tooth is compofed of its cortex or enamel, and an internal bony fubftance. The cortex has no cavity or place for marrow ; and is fo folid and hard, that laws or files can with difficulty make impreffion on it. It is thickefl upon the bafe, and gradually, as the roots turn fmaller, becomes thinner, but not proportionally to the difference of the fize of the bafe and roots. The fibres of this ena- mel are all perpendicular to the internal fubftance ; and are ftraight on the bafe, but at the fides are arched with a con- ve.'c part towards the roots {a); which makes the teeth re- fill the compreflion of any hard body between the jaws, with lefs danger of breaking thefe fibres, than if they had been fituated tranfverfely. The fpongy fockets in which the teeth are placed, likewife ferve better to prevent fuch an Injury than a more folid bafe would have done.—Notwithftanding the great hardnefs of this cortex, it is wafted by manducation. Hence the fliarp edges of fome teeth are blunted and made broad, while the rough furfaces of others are made fmooth and? flat, as people advance in life. The bony part of the teeth has its fibres running ftraight, according to the length of the teeth. When it is expofeft to the air, by the breaking or falling off of the hard cor- tex, Ic foon corrupts. And thence carious teeth are often all hollow within, when a very fmall hole appears only ex- ternally. The teeth have canals formed in their middle, wherein their nerves and blood-veffels are lodged ; which they cer- tainly need, being conftantly wafted by the attrition they are fubje£led to in manducation ; and for their furtlaer growth, not only after they firft appear, but even in adults ; as is evident when a tooth is taken out: for then the oppo- fiti , (a) Havel’s Ofteolog.

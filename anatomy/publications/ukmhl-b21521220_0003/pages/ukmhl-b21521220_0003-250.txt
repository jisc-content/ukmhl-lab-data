203 OF THE SKELETON. Parti. ■where the beginning of the flexor digitorum profundus fprouts out. The body of the ulna is triangular—The internal angle, is very (harp where the ligament that conneds the two bones is fixed : The Tides which make this angle are flat and rough, by the ddion and adhefion of the many muf- cles which are fituated here. At the diftance of one-third of the length of the ulna from the top, in its fore-part, the pafTage of the rhedullary vcflels may be feen flanc- ing upwards. The external fide of this bone is fmooth, fomewhat convex, and the angles at each edge of it are blunted by the prelTure of the mufclts equally difpofed about them. As this bone defeends, it becomes gradually fmaller ; fo that its lower end terminates in a little head, Handing on a fmall neck. Towards the fore but outer part of which ' laft, an oblique ridge runs, that gives rife to the pronator radii quadratus. The head is round, fmooth, and cover- ed with a cartilage on its internal fide, to be received into the femilunar cavity of the radius; while a ftyloid procefs (r) rifes from its outfide, to which is fixed a ftrong liga- ment that is extended to the os cuneiforme and pifiform: of the wrift. ’ Between the back-part of that internal fmooth fide and this procefs, a finuofity is left for the ten- don of the extenfor carpi ulnaris. On the fore-part of the root oP^^e procefs, fuch another depreflion may be remarked for the palTage of the ulnar artery and nerve. The end- of the bone is fmooth, and covered with a carti- lage. Between It and the bones of the wrift, a doubly concave moveable cartilage is interpofed ; which is a con- tinuation of the cartilage that covers the lower end of the radius, and is conneded loofely to the root of the ftyloid pro- cefs, and to the rough cavity there ; in which mucilaginous glands are lodged. ^The (r) Tpafohin', Malleolus externus.

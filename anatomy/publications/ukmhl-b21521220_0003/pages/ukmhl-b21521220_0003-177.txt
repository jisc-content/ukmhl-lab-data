*35 BONES OF THE HEAD. Chap. II. In w'hat different manners ought the fevcral clalTes of teeth to be extraded when fiich an operation is ntccfl‘,iry Whence proceeds the violent obffinate hemorrhagy which foinetimes attends tlie drawing of teeth (a) ? Why is it more difficult and dangerous to draw the eye- teeth than any other ? What makes it impoflible frequently to draw grinder's without bringing a^ay part of the jaw-bone with them, or breaking the fangs ? Why do ^ecth foon replaced, after being extradlcd become again fixed in the fockets (^) ? According to ,the divifion made of the fkeleton, we ffiould now proceed to the delcription of the trunk of the body. But we muff; firff confider a bone which camiot well be faid to belong to either the head or the trank; nor is it immediately joined to any other, and therefore Is very fel- dom preferved with ficeletons. However, it is generally de- fcrlbed by authors after the bones' of the face. In obetiience, therefore, to the prevailing metliod, I fliall next examine the ffrudlure of the 'OS H Y O I D E S. The os hyoldes (r), is fituat^d' horizontally between the root of the tongue and the larynx. It is properly enough named hyoides, from the rtfcmblance it bears to the Greek letter u •, and may, for a clearer demonftration of its ffruc* ture, be diffinguiffied into its cornua, and appendices.

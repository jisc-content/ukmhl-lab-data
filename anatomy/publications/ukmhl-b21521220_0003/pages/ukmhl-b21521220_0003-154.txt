OF THE SKELETON. Part I. ri2 and Obferv. vol 5. art. 30, large aperture into the noftrils; but, in a recent fubjeft, it is fo covered at its back-part by the palate-bone, in the middle by the os fpongiofum inferius, before by a ftrong membrane, that one or fometimes two holes, fcarcely fo large as a crow-quill, are only left at the upper part; which, after a fhort winding procefs, open into the nof- trils betwee-n the two olTa fpongiofa. At the bottom of this cavity, we may often obferve fome protuberances, in which the fmall points of the roots of the teeth are con- tained (^). This cavern and the fockets of the teeth arc often divided by the interpofition only of a very thin bony plate, which is liable to be eroded by acrid matter collec- ted in the antrum, or to be broke in drawing a tooth (r). The fymptoms of a colle6lion of matter here naturally led ns to the pra£lice of pulling out the teeth, and piercing through this plate into the antrum, to procure an evacuation of the colle£led matter; by which confiderable fet^fice is fre- quently done {d). The maxillary fmufes have the fame ufes as the frontal and fphenoidal; and the fituatlon of the fmufes is fuch, that the liquor drilling from them, from the cells of the ethmoid and palate bones, and from the lacrymal duds, may always moif- ten all the parts of the membrane of the nares in the diffe- rent fituations of the head. Though the membranes which line the frontal, fphe- noidal, and maxillary fmufes, are continuations of the one •which covers the bones within the nofe; yet they arc much thinner than it is, and have fo much fmaller veffels, that the injedion which makes the membrane of the nofe red all over, fills only fome few velfels of the maxillary fi- nufes, and is fcarcely obferved in the frontal and fphenoi- dal.

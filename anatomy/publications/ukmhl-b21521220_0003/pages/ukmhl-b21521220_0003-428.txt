Many of them pafs over feveral joints, each of which t!\ey bend in fome degree, whereby a lefs part of their remaining force goes to bend the joint to wliich they are particularly deftined- Ihe flefliy fibres themfelvts of the mufcles frequently in- tercept angles wuth the tendon in which they terminate; w ence their force is diminifiied in proportion to the fine of the angle of their infertion. Finally, the mufcles move their oppoferl weights with the greateft velocity and expe- dition, fo as not only to overcome the equilibrium, but likewife to add a confiderable celerity to the weight. All thefe Ioffes of pow’er being computed, make it evi- dent, that the force exerted by mufcles in their contraction, is exceeding great, and almoll beyond any mechanical com- putation. . The effeCt is fcarce one-fixtieth of the whole force exerted by the mufcle, and yet only a fmall number of thefe mufcles, weighing but a few pounds, are able not only to raife fome thoufands of pounds, but alfo with a confiderable celerity. Nor is this to be reputed any defeCl of wifdom in the Creator : For all thofe lofies of power were necelTary for ^ jull fymmetry or proportion of the parts, and for various motions and celerities in different direftions. But we may, however, conclude from hence, that the affion of the nervous or animal fluid is very power- ful, fince, in aii engine fo fuull, it can exert a force equal to fome thoufand pounds for a confiderable time, even for many days together; nor does this feem to be otherwife ex- , .plicahle, than by the incredible celerity by which the influx of this fluid obeys the command of the will. But how or whence it acquires fuch a velocity, is not in our power to fay ; it is fufficient that we know the jaws of its motion, are fuchj

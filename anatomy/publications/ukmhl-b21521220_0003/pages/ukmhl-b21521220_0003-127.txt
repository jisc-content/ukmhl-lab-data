85 Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. of different Tides, or rather is owing to the adfion of the mufcles depreffing the bone on each fide of it, while this part is free from their compreffion. Thefe prints of the mufcles of this bone are very ftrong and plain in fome fubjeas, but are not fo diftind in others. All round the great foramen, tliii edges are unecjual, for the firmer .ul- hefion of the ftrong citcular ligament which goes thence to the firft vertebra. One end of each lateral or moderator ligament of the head, is fixed to a rough furface at the fore-part of each condyle, and the perpendicular one is conne£fed to a rough part of the edge of the great hole between the two condyles. Immediately before the con- dyles, two little deprelfions are made in the external fur- face of the cuneiform procefs, for the infertion of the re.Pi anteriores minores mufcles, which are unjuftly aferi- bed to Cowper: And ftill farther forward, near the fphe-. noid bone, are two other fuch depreffions, for the recep- tion of the reiTi anteriores majores. When we confider the fize of the prints of mufcles on the occipital bone, be- fore and behind its condyles, and at the fame time com- pare their diftances from thefe centres of motion of the head, we mull fee how much ftronger the mufcles are which pull the head backwards, than thofe which bend it forward ; and how much greater force the former ac- quire by the long lever they a£t with, than the latter which are inferted fo near the condyles, This great force in the extenfor mufcles is altogether neceffary, that they might not only keep the head from falling forward in an eiedl pofture, but that they might fupport it when we bow forward in the moft neceflary offices of focial life, when the weight of the head comes to a£l at right angles on the verte- bra of the neck, and obtains a long lever to a£l with. On the inner furface of the os occipitis we fee two ridges ; one ftanding perpendiculiirly, the other running horizontal-

28 OF THE BONES Part r. bryos when dlflefted : And how much more tender muft the bones be before that time, wlien neither knife nor eye is capable to difeover the leaft rudiments of them ? By de- grees they become more folid, then alTume the natute of griftles, and at lad cHOTify ; the cohelion of their plates and fibres always increafing in proportion to their increafed foliditics; as is evident from the time necefl'ary to un- ravel the texture of bones of peo^e of different ages, or of denfe and of fpongy bones, or of fhe different parts of the fame bone, and from the more tedious exfoliations of thc^ bones of adults than of children. After any part of a bone is fi^ offified, its fibres are extended little more in length at th.it part, though they in- ^creafe there in thicknefs, and though their fofter parts con- tinne to become longer (r). As the folidity of bones increafes, their periofteum more cafily feparates from them. When bones are membranous, the periofteum and they cannot be diftinguifhed ; they ap- pear to be the fame ^fubftance. When they are cartilages, their membrane adheres fo firmly to them, that it is diffi- cult to feparate it from them. Where the bony fibres are rigid, the periofteum is eafily taken off.—Is the fimilarity of ftruiffure and confequent greater attraflion of the mem- brane and fubftance it inejofes, while they are both flexible, the caufe of their greater adhefion ? or is it owing to the veffels that go from the one to the other being then larger't or do both thefe caufes combine to produce this effe£l ? or is the membrane or cartilage, which becomes bone after- wards, to be confidered as the fame fubftance with the per riofteum (/) ? and muft all thefe plates of bones be therefor# faid to be layers of the periofteum hardened {«/) ?

^FEMALE SKELETON. 257 The great hSeroJity of the ojpi ifchiufn Is flatter In women than In men, becaufe It Is more prelTed upon In the fedentary life which females enjoy. In confequence of tlie pehis of women being wider, the articulations of their thigh-bones muft be farther removed from each other ; and therefore a larger fpace Is left for the procreation and bitth of children (c)} which diftance of the thighs may be one reafon why women in running flauflle more from one fide to the other than men, to preferve the centre of gravity of their bodies front falling too far to a fide of the joint of the thigh that fupports them when the other is railed, which would endanger their tumbling to the ground.

Part I, OF THE BONES- 34 ture, let him confult Kerchlngius (9), who gives us the de- lineations of abortions from three days after conception, and, traces the oflification of the bones from three weeks and a month, till the time of the birth: To whom fliould be added Coiterus {p) and Eyflbnius [q). An account of this fubje£l might alfo be collcfted out of Ruyfeh’s works, where fome of the miftakes committed by the former au- thors are corredled ; and feveral more particulars, to make the hiftory of the ofteogenea more accurate, have fince been added by Nefblt (r) and Albinus (j). » I muft refer to the authors now quoted for the more curious part of the human ofteogeny ; not having prepa- rations enough to give fuch a full hiftory of it as is done by them. But I fliall endeavour to explain the more ufe- ful and neceftary part of the ofteogeny, by fubjolning to the defeription of each bone of an adult, its condition In ripe children ; that Is, in fuch as are born at the ordinary time j and fhall point out what parts of each are after- wards joined in form of epiphyfes. This, with the fol- lowing general rules, feem to me fiifficient for underftand- ing as much of this fubje£l as is neceftary in the pracHce of phyfic and furgery. 1. Wherever I mention any parts being cartilaginous, .or their being ftlll feparable from the other parts of the bone to which they belong, I would be underftood to hint, that, about feven or eight years of age, fuch parts are of- fified and united to their proper bones, unlefs when it is faid that they are afterwards formed into epiphyfes. 2. Such as become epiphyfes are generally olTified at fe- ven or eight years of age ; but, being for the moft part • raoiftened ' (0) Anlhropograph. ichnograph. et ofteogenea foetuum.

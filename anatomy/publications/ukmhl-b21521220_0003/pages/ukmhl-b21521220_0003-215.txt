173 Chap. n. BONES O F THE TRUNK. outwards towards the acetabulum j between thefe two ridges the bone is hollow and fmooth, for lodging the head of the peclineus mufcle. Immediately,below, where the lower ridge is to take the turn downwards, a winding niche is made, which is comprehended m the great fora- rnen’of a fkeleton; but is formed into a hole by a fubtend- ed ligament in the recent fubjtcR, for the paffige of the pofterior crural nerve, an artery, and a vein. The inter- nal end of the os pubis is rough and unequal, for the firm- er adhefion ' of the thick ligamentous cartilage that con- neefts it to its fellow of the other fide: The procefs which goes down from that to the os ifclnum Is broad and rough before, where the gracilis and upper heads of the 'triceps, or rather quadriceps, addudlor femorla have their ori- gin. The fubftance of the os pubis is the fame as of other broad bones. Only a part of the large pnd of this bone is oflified, and the whole leg is cartilaginous, in a child born at the full time. Between the os Ifchium and pubis a very large irregular ' hole is left, which, from its refemblance to a door or fiiield, has been called thproides. This hole is all, except • the niche for the pofterior crural nerve, filled up, in a re- cent fubjedl, with a ftrong ligamentous membrane, that adheres very firmly to its circumference. From this mem-? brane chiefly the two obturator mufclcs, external and in- ternal, take their rife. The great defign of this hole, be- fides rendering the bone lighter, is to allow a ftrong enough origin to the obturator mufcles, and fufllcicnt fpace for lodging their bellies, that there may be no dan- ger of difturbing the funftions of the contained vifeera of the pelvis by the a£lions of the Internal, nor of the exter- nal being bruifed.by the thigh bone, efpecially by its lefley ^rochariter,

30 OF THE BONES Parti. That the offifying of bones greatly depends on preflure, feems to be evinced from the frequent examples we meet with of other parts turning bony, when long cxpoftd to the prefling force of the furrounding parts, or when th^;y •are fubje£led to the like circumftances by their own. fre- quent and violent conira£lion. Witncfs the bones found frequently near the bafe of the heart in fome old men (y), and in feveral other creatures. Nay, the mufcular fub- Ilance of the heart has been oflified in fuch (z\ and the arteries of old men often become bony. The cartilages of the larynx are generally olTified in adults. In beafts of burden, the cartilages between the vertebrae of the back very often change into complete bones; and, being inti- mately united with the vertebrae, the ‘whole appears on« continued bone: Nor is the perioftcum'exempted from fuch an induration (a). To confirm this argument ftill farther, we may obferve, that bones begin their olTification at the places where they are moft expofed to thefe caufes, viz. in the cylindrical bones, from a middle ring; and in the broad ones, at op near their centre, from one or more dillindl points. The reafon of which is, TTiat thefe parts are continguous to the bellies of the mufcles annexed to the bones, where the fwd- ling of thefe moving powers is greateft. The elFecfs of this may be feen in fome of the bones, as the fcapula and olTa ilium, which are covered with mufcles on each fide; how compa£l: and thin they are in adults, where the bellies of the mufcles were lodged ; whereas in children they are thicker. But this being the middle part of thefe bones, where the greateft number of fibres is, this particular place would (j) Riolan. Comment de oflib. cap. 32—Bartholin. Hill, medic, cent. I. lift. 50.

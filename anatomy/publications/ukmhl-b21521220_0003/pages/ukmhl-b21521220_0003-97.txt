5S aap.II. BONES OF THE HEAD. The external furface of the upper part of the cranium is very fmooth and equal, being only covered -with the pe- rlofteum (common to all the bones, but in the fkull diftin- guilhed by the name of pericranium)^ the thin frontal and occipital mufcles, their tendinous aponeurofis, and with the common teguments of the body; while the external furface of its lower part has numerous rifings, depreflions> and holes, which afford convenient origin and infertion to the mufcles that are conne6led to it, and allow fafe palfage for the veffels and nerves that run through anA near it. , The Internal furface of the upper part of the fkull Is commonly fmooth, except where the veffels of the dura mater have made furrows in it, while the bones were foft. - â–  Surgeons fhould be cautious when they trepan here, left in fawing or raifing the bone where fuch furrows are, they wound thefe veffels. In the upper part of the in- ternal furface of feveraL fkulls, there are likewife pics of different magnitudes and figures, which feem to be formed by fome parts of the brain being more luxuriant and pro- < minent than others. In thefe pits, the fkull is fo much thinner than any where elfe, that it is often rendered dia- phanous, the two tables being clofely compared without a diploe; the want of which is fupplied by veffels going from the dura matter into a great many fmall holes ob- fervable in the pits. Thefe veffels are larger, and much more confpicuous than any others that are fent from the dura mater to the fkull; as evidently appears from the . drops of blood they pour out, when the fkull Is raifed from the dura mater in a recent fubjeft; and therefore they may furnifh a fufficient quantity of liquors neceffary to prevent the brittlenefs of this thin part. The knowledge of thefe pits fhould teach furgeons to faw cautioufly and flow- ly through the external table of the fkull, when they are I performing

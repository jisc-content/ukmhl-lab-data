236 Part I. OF THE SKELETON. and forwards. This liead Is protuberant and rough on its outfide, where a ftrong round ligament and the mufculus bi- ceps are inferred ; and, below the back-part of its internal fide, a tubercle may be remarked, that gives rife to the Rrong tendinous part of the folteus mufcle. Tlte body of this bone is a little crooked inwards and backwards: whicli figure is owing to the adlions of die mufcles ; but is ftill farther increafed by nurfes, who often hold children carelefsly by the*legs. The flrarpelt angle of the fibula is forwards ; on each fide of which the bone is « confiderably, but unequally, deprelTed by the, bellies of the feveral mufcles that rife from or a£t upon it ; and in old people, thefe mufcles make diftinfl finuofities for them- felves. The external furface of the fibula is deprefled obr liquely from above downwards and backwards by the, two peronaei. Its internal furface is unequally divided into two narrow longitudinal planes, by an oblique ridge extended from the upper part of the anterior angle, to join with the lower end of the internal angle. To this ridge-the liga- ment ftretched between the two bones of the leg is connec- ted. The anterior of the two planes is very narrow above, where the extenfor longus digitorum and extenfor longus pollicis arife from it ; but is broader below, where it has the print of the nonus Vefalii. The pofterior plane is broad and hollow’, giving origin to the larger fhare of the tibialis pollicus. The internal angle of this bone'has a ten- dinous membrane fixed to it, from which fome fibres of the flexor digitorum longus take their rife. The pofteri- or furface'of the fibula is the plainefl and fmoothefl ; but is made flat above by the folaeus, and is hollowed below by the flexor pollicis longus. In- tlie middle of tliis furface, the canal for the medullary veflels may be ieen flanting down- wards. I have taken particular notice of the entry and direction ■

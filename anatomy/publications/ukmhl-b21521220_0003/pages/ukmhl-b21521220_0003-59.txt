IN GENERAL. 17 Olisp. X. Left any imagine the falts and oils of bones, while in a natural ftate, to be of the fame acrid kind with thofe ob- tained from therti by the chemical analyfis, it is to be ob- ferved, that thefe principles may be extracted from bones in the form of a very mild jelly, by boiling them in water. The bones fuftain and defend the other parts of the body. Bones are lined within, as well as covered externally, with a membrane j which is therefore commonly called Pe- riosteum Internum. INTERNAL PERIOSTEUM. The internal periojleum is an extremely fine membrane j nay frequeittly, it has a loofe reticular texture; and there- fore it is compared by fome to the arachnoid coat of the fpinal marrow: fo that we cannot txpedl to divide it into layers as we can divide the external periofteum. We can, however, obferve its procefles entering into the tranfverfe pores of the bones, where probably they are continued to ' form the intermediate canals for the marrow diftributed through the fubftance of the bones; and along with them veflels are fent, as from the external periofteum, into the bone (y). Thefe procefles being of a very delicate tex- ture, the adhefion of this membrane to the bone is fo fmall, that it feparates commonly more eafily from the bone than from the marrow whicli it contains : wherefore one might call it the common membrane of the marrow, rather than by the name it now has. But whether the one or the other defignation ought to be given it, is not worthy a difpute. From the internal furface of the internal periojleum, a great number of thin membranes are produced ; which, pairing acrofs the cavity, unite with others of the fame kind, and form fo many diftimfl: bags, which communicate VoL.

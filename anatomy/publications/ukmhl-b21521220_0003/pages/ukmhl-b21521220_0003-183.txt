Chap. II, BONES OF THE TRUNK. i.\x The fubftance of the procefles is confiderably ftronger and firmer, and has a thicker external plate, than the bodies of the vertebrse thernfelves. The feven prosejfe^ form a -concavity at their fore-part, which, joined to the one at the back-part of the bodies, makes a great hole *, and the holes of all the vertebrae form a long large conduit (o), for continuing the fpinal marrow, -In the upper and lower edge of each lateral bridge, there is a notch. Thefe are fo adapted to each other in the contiguous vertebrae, as to form a round hole in each fide between each two vertebrae, through which the nerves that proceed from the fpinal marrow and its blood-veflels pafs. The arikulatiotis, then, of thefe true vertebrae are plain- ly double : for their bodies are joined by the intervening cartilage above defcribed *, and their oblique procefles, be- ing tipped with cartilages, are fo conneÂ£led by their liga- ments as to allow a fmall degree Df motion on every fide. Hence it is evident, that their centre of motion is altered in different pofitions of the trunk: for, when we bow for- wards, the upper moved part bears entirely on the bodies of the vertebrae; if we bend back, the oblique procefles fupport the weight; if we recline to one fide, we reft upon the oblique procefles of ihat fide and part of the bodies; if we ftand ereiSt, all the bodies and oblique procefles have their fliare in our fupport. Hence it follows, i. That becaufe the joints of which the fpine is compofed are fo numerous, the fpinal marrowy nerves, blood-veflels, &c. are not liable to fuch comprel- fion and over-ftretching in the motion of the trunk of the body as they would otherwife be, fince feveral vertebrae muft be concerned in every motion of the fpine ; and there- fore a very fmall curvature is made at the conjunction of any (o) Ufa (TiiiXNV,

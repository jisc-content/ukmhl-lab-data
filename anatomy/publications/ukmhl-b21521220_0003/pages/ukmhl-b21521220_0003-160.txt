OF THE SKELETON. ii8 Parti., Below the fpongy bones already mentioned, there are fometimes two others, one in each noftril, which feem to be a produ£lion‘ of the fides of the maxillary finus turned downwards (/). When this third fort of fpongy bones is found, the middle one of the three in each noftril is, the largeft, and the lowed is the fmalleft.- Befides all thefe, there are often feveral other fmall bones ftanding out into the noftrils, that, from their fliape, might alfo deferve the name of turbinata: but are uncertain in their bulk, fituation, and number (>^). The names of thefe bones fufliciently declare their fpon- gy fubftance, which has no firm external plate covering it. They are joined to the ofla maxillaria, palati, and un- guis, in all fubjefls, by a firm union of fubftance ; and as this often happens in people of no great age, fome au- thors (/) are of opinion, that they Ihould be efteemed part of the palate-bones *, others {m) think, that fince their upper edge is continued by a plate to a part of the os ethmoldes, they ought to be efteemed a part of this bone. Their ufe is, to ftraighten the noftrils, to afford a large furface for extending the organ of finelllng, to cover part of the antra maxillaria, and to alfift in forming the under part of the lacrymal du£bs, the orifices of which into the nofe are concealed by thefe bones. The olTa turbinata are nearly complete in a new-born infant. VOMER. Vomer, or bone refembling a plough-ftiare, is the thir- teenth of the upper jaw, and is without a fellow, forming the lower and back-parts of the partition of the nofe («).

IN GENERAL. 41 Chap. I. turns on another, as a wheel does on its axis. Thus tlie firrt vertebra of the neck moves on the tooth-like procefs of the fecond. This is the moll; proper kind of ginglimus. The fecond fpecies fhould be efleemed that articulation where feveral prominent and hollow furfaces of two bones move on each other within the fame common ligament 5 as in the knee, &c. The third fort of ginglimus is, when two bones are ar- ticulated to each other at^ different parts, with a diftinfl apparatus of the motory machines at each; fuch is the ar- ticulation of the 03 occipitis with the firft vertebra of the neck; of any two contiguous vertebrae by their oblique proceffes; of the ribs with the bodies of tranfverfe pro- ceffes of the vertebrse; of the radius with the ulna, tibia with the fibula, aflragalus with the calcaneum. Sec. I would entirely throw out what is commonly called the third kind of ginglimus; for in examining the conjunÂ£lion of a bone witli two others, as in the common example of a vertebra joined with the one above and below, the con- nexion of the middle one with each of the other two ought to be confidered feparatdy; otherwife wc niight, with the fame propriety, ellcem the articulations that the long bones, the femur, tibia, humerus, &c. have at their dif- ferent ends, as one articulation ; which is abfurd. If the moveable bones are not conneXed and kept firm by fome ftrong fubllance, they would be luxated at every motion of. the joints; and if their hard rough unequal fur- faces were to play on each other, their motion would not only be dilficult, but the lofs of fubllance from attrition would be great. Therefore ligaments arc made to obviate the fit ft, and cartilages to prevent the other inconveniency. But becaufe ligaments and cartilages turn rigid, inllexible, and rough, unlefs they are kept moift, a fulheient quanti- ty of proper liquors is fupplied for their lubrication, and VoL. 1. F to

200 OF THE SKELETON. Part I. 1 he fcapula anJ clavicle are joinedh'^ plain furfaces, tip- ped with cartilage {e); by which neither bone is allowed any confiderablc motion, being tightly tied down by the common capfular ligament, and by a very ftrong one which proceeds fropi the coracoid procefs ; but divides into two before it is fixed into the clavicle, with I'uch a direction, as can either allow this bone to have a fmall rotation, in which its pollerior edge turns more backwards, while the anterior one rifes farther forwards j or it can yield to the fore-part of the fcapula moving downwards, while the back-part of it Is drawn upwards ;• in both which cafes, the oblong fmooth articulated furfaces of the clavicle and fcapula are not in the fame plane, but Hand a little tranf- verfely, or acrofs each other, and thereby preferve this joint from luxations, to which it would be fubjedT: if either of the bones was to move on the other perpendicularly up and down wdthout any rotation.-—= Sometimes a move- able ligamentous cartilage is found in this joint; and fome- times fuch a cartilage is only interpofed at the anterior half of it: and in fome old fubjedfs I have found a fefa- moid bone here {f)> The fcapula is connedfed to the head,' os hyoides, vertebrae, ribs, and arm-bone, by mufcles, that have one end faftened to thefe bones, and the other to the fcapula, which can move it upwards, downwards^ back- wards, or forwards ; by the quick fuccefiion of thefe mo- tians, its whole body is carried in a circle. But being alfo often mo^'ed' as upon an axis perpendicular to its plane, its circumference turns in a circle whofe centre this axis is ig)- Whichever of thefe motions it performs, it always carries the outer end of the clavicle and the arm along with it. The glenoid cavity of this bone receives the os humeri, (;) Acromion, ItIf, Claufun. (y) Jac. Sylv. Ifagog. Anat. lib. i. cap. i. Sec Winflow, Mcmoircs de I’acad. dcs fcicnccs, I7J6.

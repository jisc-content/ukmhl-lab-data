OF THE SKELETON. Part 1. 90 gain (x). The falx is conneded to its ridge, and to the unperforated part of the cribriform plate. When the crifta is broke, its bafe is fometimes found to be hollow, with its cavity opening into the nofe (y). Immediately before the higheft part of this procefs, is the blind hole of the frontal bone, which, as was formerly remarked, is often in a good meafure formed by a notch in the fore-part of the root of the crifta. From the middle of the outer furface of the cribriform lamella, a thin folid plate is extended downwards and for- wâ€™ards, having the fame common bafe with the crifta galll. Generally it is not exaiftly perpendicular, but is inclined to one fide or other, and therefore divides the cavity of the nofe unequally. Its inclination to one fide, and flexure in the middle, is fometimes fo great, that it_ fills up a large fhare of one of the noftrils, and has been mlftaken for a polypus there. It is thin at its rife, and rather ftill thin- ner in its middle; yet afterwards, towards its lower edge, it becomes thicker, that its conjundHon with the bones and middle cartilage of the nofe might be firmer. At a little diftance from each fide of this external pro- cefs, a cellular and fpongy bony fubftancfe depends from the cribriform plate. The number and figure of the cells in this irregular procefs of each fide, are very uncertain, and not to be reprefented in words; only the cells open into each other, and into the cavity of the nofe : The up- permoft, which are below the aperture of the frontal finuf- es, are formed like funnels. The outer furface of thefe cells is fmooth and plain, where this bone aflifts in compo- fing the orbit; at which place, on each fide, it has got the name of os planum; on the upper edge of which a final! notch or two may fometimes be obfcrved, which go to the formation (*) Verruca pra:dnra, feptum oflis fpongiofi.

OF THE SKELETON. Pan I. From the roots of the anterior clinoid procefles the bone is 'extended on each fide outwards and forwards* till it ends in a fliarp point, which may have the name of the tranfverfc fpinous procefies.—Between, but a little farther back than the two anterior clinoid procefles, we fee a protuberance confiderably fmaller than the pofterior clinoid procefs, but of its fliape. Another procefs from between the tranf- verfe procefles, often forces itfelf forwards into the os eth- moides. Within the flcull, there are two ftmi(Jities in the internal part of each wing of the fphenoid bone, for receiving the middle part of the brain—One between the tranfverfe fpi- nous procefles, for lodging the part of the brain where the crura medullse dblongatae are.——Immediately before the third or middle clinoid procefs, a Angle pit may generally be remarked, from which a foflTa goes out on each fide to the holes through which the optic nerves pafs. The pit is formed by the conjoined optic nerves; and in the folTa thefe nerves are lodged, as they run divided within the Ikull. Between that third protuberance and the, pofterior clinoid procefs, the larger pit for the glandula pituitaria may be remarked. This cavity, becaufe of its refemblance to aTurkifti faddle, is always deferibed under the name of fella lurcicay or ephippium.—On the Tides of the pofterior clinoid procefs a foftir may be remarked, that ftretches up- "wards, then is continued forwards along the fides of the fella turcica, near to the anterior clinoid procefles, where a pit on each fide is made. Thefe folTse point out the courfe of the two internal .carotid arteries, after they have entered the fkull. Befides all thefe, feveral other foflie may be obferved, leading to the feveral holes, and im* printed by the nerves and blood-vefiels. The holes on each fide of the os fphenoides are fix pro- per, and three common. The firft is the round one im* mediately

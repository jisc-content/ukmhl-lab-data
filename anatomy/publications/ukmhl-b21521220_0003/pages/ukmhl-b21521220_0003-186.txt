The caufes, on which »fuch an inequality of thicknefs in different fides of the vertebras depends, may vary. For euhcr it may be owing to an over-diflenfion " of the vefsels of one fide, and from thence a preternatural increafe of the thicknefs of that part: or, which is more commonly the cafe, it may proceed from an obftruftion of the vefsels, by which the application of proper nourifii- ment to the bony fubftance is hindered; whether that ob- ftruftion depends on the faulty difpofition of the vefsels or ■ fluids^ or if it is produced by an unequal mechanical pref- fure occafioned by a paralytic weaknefs of the mufcles and ligaments, or by a fpafmodic over-a£fion of the mufcles on any fide of the fpine, or by people continuing long, or putting themfelves frequently, into any pofture declining from the ereft one: In all thefe cafes one common efFe6l follows, to wit, the vertebrae, or their cartilages, or both, turn thick on that fide where the vefsels are free, and re- main thin on the other fide w^here thefe vefsels are Rraighten- cd or ob(lru£led>—Whenever any morbid curvature is thus made, a fecond turn, but in an oppofite diredlion to the for- mer, muft be formed; both becaufe the mufcles on the convex fide of the fpine being flrctchedi muft have a ftrong- er natural contra61ion to draw the parts to w^hich their ends are fixed, and becaufe the patient makes efforts to keep the centre of gravity of the body perpendicular to its bafe, that the mufcles may be relieved from a conftant violent con-* tra£Hle ftate, w'hich always creates uneafinefs and pain. Whence once we underftand how thefe crooked fpines are produced, there is little difficulty in forming a juft prog- nofis;

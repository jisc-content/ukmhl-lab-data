i3 Part I. OF THE BONES with each other; and thefe again are fubdivided into com- municating veficular cells, in which the marrow is con- tained. Hence it is, that the marrow, when hardened, and viewed with a microfeope, appears like a duller of fmall pearls ; and that the hardened marrow of bones, bu- ried long under ground, or laid fome time in water, and then dried, is granulous (z).— This texture is much the fame with what obtains in other cellular parts of the body, where fat is colleded ; only that the cells containing the marrow are fmaller than thofe of the twuca adipofa or ceU lulofa elfewhere ; which probably is owing to their being inclofed in the bones, where they are not fo much ftrctched or extended as in other parts. > t. OF THE MARROW. The Marro’w is the oily part of the blood, feparated by fmall arteries, and depofited in thefe cells. Its colour and confiftence m'ay therefore vary according to the Hate of the veflels, and their dillribution on the membranes of the cells. The marrow, as well as the other fat of the body, che- mically analized^ yields, befides oil and water, a conGder- able proportion of an acid liquor, but no alkali {a). This may be the reafon of its being Icfs putrefeent than the blood or mofl other parts of animals [b); which is a necef- fary quality in a fubflance that is conllantly expofed to a confiderable degree of heat, and is more in a ftagnating condition than the other liquors. BeGdes the arteries, which I mentioned already, (p.'i2.) to be fent from the bones to the marrow, there is at Icaft one artery for each bone ; feveral bones have more, whofe • principal (s) Ruyfeh.

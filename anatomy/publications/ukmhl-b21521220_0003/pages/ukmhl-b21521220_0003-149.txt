BONES OF THE HEAD. Cha’3. ir. O 2 ture i procefTes by fome authors. The one at the external can- thus of the orbit, called the fuperior orhitar procefs, is the longefl; and thickeft. The fecond terminates near the middle of the lower edge of the orbit in a (liarp point, and is named the inferior orhitar procefs. The third, pla- ced near the lower part of the cheek, and thence called - inaxiUary, is the (hot-ttfi:, and neareft to a right angle.—— The fourth, which is called zygomatic, becaule it i3 ex- tended backwards to the zygoma of the temporal bone, ends in a point, and has one'fide ftraight and the other Hoping Between the two orbitar angles there is a con- cave arch, which makes about a third of the external cir- cumference of the orbit, from which a fifth procefs is ex- tended backwards within the orbit, to form near one third of that cavity; and hence it may be called the internal or- bitar procefs.—From the lower edge of each of the ofla malarum, which is between the maxillary and zygomatic piocelTes, the mafleter mufcle takes its origin; and from the exterior part of the zygomatic procefs, the mufculus % diftortor oris rifes j in both which places the furface of the bone is rough. < On the external furface of each cheek bone, one or more fmall holes are commonly found, for the tranfmifiion of fmall nerves or blood-vcfllds from, and fometimes into, tlie orbit.— Ou the internal furface are the-holes for the paflage of the nutritious vefiels of thefe bones. A notch on the outfide of the internal orbitar procefs of each of thefe bones alfifts to form the great flit common to this bone and to the fphe- noid, maxillary, and palate bones. The fubjlance of th.efe bones is, in proportion to their bulk, thick, hard, and folid, with fpme cancelli, ' Each of the oflii malarum is joined, by its fuperior and internal orbitar procell'es, to the os front is, arid to the or- bitar procefs of, the fpliengid bone, by the tranfverfe fu-

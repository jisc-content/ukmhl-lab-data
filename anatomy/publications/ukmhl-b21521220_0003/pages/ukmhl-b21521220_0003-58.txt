i6 Part L OF THE BONES the furface of a recent bone fra£lured tranfverfely, and the oozing of oil through the moll folid bones of a Ikeleton, which renders them greafy and yellow, are a confirmation of the ufe of thefe canals. Of what advantage this diftri- bution of the marrow through the fubllance of bones is, will be mentioned when the nature and ufe of this animal oil is inquired into. _Mofl bones have one or more large oblique canals form- ed through their fides for the paflage of the medullary vef- fels, which are to be deferibed afterwards. Bones expofed to a ftrong fire in chemical veffds, are refolved, in the fam,e manner as the other parts of animals, into phlegmy fplrity volatile falty fetid oil, and a black caput mcriuum. But the proportion of thefe principles varies according to the age, folidities, and other circumftances of bones. Young bones yield the larged proportion of phlegm ; fpongy bones afford mod oil; and folid ones give mod fait and black refiduum. Though this refiduum can fcarce be changed by the force of fire while it is in clofc veffels j yet, wlien it is burnt in an open fire, the tenacious oil, to which it owes its black colour, is forced away, and a wlrite earth is left that has little or no fixed fait in it (v). This earth feems to be the proper condituent folid part of bones, and the other principles give it firmnefs and tena- city : for the quantity of the earth is fo great, that, after all the other principles are feparated from a bone, its for- mer fliape and fize remain (‘Zi') *, but it is very brittle till it is mpidened with water or oil,'when it recovers fome tena- city. The increafe of the proportion of earth in old peoples bones, is one reafon of their being more brittle than thofe of young people. 2 ' Led (u) Later chemifts have difeovered this earth to be calcareous earth turated with phofphoric acid.

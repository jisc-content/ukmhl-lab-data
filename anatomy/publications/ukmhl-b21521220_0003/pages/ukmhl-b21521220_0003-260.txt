The convexity behind renders the whole fabric dronger, where it is mod expofed to injuries , and the large anterior hollow is necedary for a fafe paflage to the numerous veffels, nerves, and tendons of the fingers. The ftihjlance of thefe bones is fpongy and cellular, but drong in refped of their bulk. The three fird bones of the carpus make an oblong head, by which they are articulated with the cavity at the lower ends of the bones of the fore-arm, fo as to allow motion on all fides \ and by a quick fucceflion of thefe mo tions, they may be moved in a circle. But as the joint is oblong, and therefore the two dimenfions are unequal, no motion is allowed to the carpus round its axis, except what it has in the pronation and fupination along with the radius. -The articulation of the fird three bones of the fuperior row, w'ith the bones of the inferior, is fuch as allows of motion, efpecially backwards and forwards ^ to (k) Galen.

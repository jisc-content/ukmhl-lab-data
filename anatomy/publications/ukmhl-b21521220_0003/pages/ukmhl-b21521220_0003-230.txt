OF THE SKELETON. ' Tart I. ?88 turn thinner ; and in each a fuperficial cavity or a rough furface is to be feen, where the firft ribs are received or joined to the aernum. In the fide of the under end of this firft bone, the half of the pit for the fecond rib on each fide is formed The upper part of the furface be- hind is covered with a ftrong ligament, which fecures the clavicles; and is afterwards to be more particulatly taken no- tice of. The fecond or middle divifion of this bone is much long- er, narrower, and thinner, than the firft ; but excepting that it is a little narrower above than below, it is nearly equal all over in its dimenfiens of breadth or thicknefs. —- In the fides of it are complete pits for the third, fourth, fifth, and fixth ribs', and an half of the pits for the fecond and feventh ; the lines, which are marks of the former divifion of this bone, being extended from the mid- dle of the pits of one fide to the middle of the correfpond- ing pits of the other fide. Near its middle an unoflified part of .the bone is fometimes found ; which, freed of the ligamentous menibrane or cartilage that fills it, is defcribtd as a hole : and in this place, for the moft part, we may obferve a tranfverfe line, which has made authors divide this bone into two.—When the cartilage between this and the firft bone is not oftified, a manifeft motion of this upon the firft may be obferved in refpiratlon, or in raifing the fternum, by pulling the ribs upwards, or diftending the lungs with air in a recent fubje£l. The third bone is much lefs than the other tw'o, and has only one half of the pit for the feventh rib formed in it; wherefore it might be reckoned only an appendix of the fternum.——In young fubjects it is aUvays cartilaginous, and is better known by the name of cariilago xiphoides or enffortnis [e) than any other ; though the antients often called (0 Clypealis, gladialis, mucronata, malum granatum, feutum fiomachi* epiglottalis, cultralisj medium "''uis, feutiformis, cnficulata.

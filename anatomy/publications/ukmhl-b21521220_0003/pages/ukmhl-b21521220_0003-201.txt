They are dlllinguifhed from the bones already defcribed juftly enough by this epithet of falfe ; becaufe, though each bone into which they can be divided in young people refembUs the true vertebrae in figure, yet none of them contribute to the motion of the trunk of the body; they being intimately united to each other in adults, except at their lower part, where they are moveable ; whence they are commonly divided into two bones, os facrum, and os coccygis- Os Sacrum {/), Is fo called, from being ofiered in fa- crifice by the antlents, or rather becaufe of its largenefs in rcfpe£l of the other vertebrae This bone is of an irre.* gular triangular fhape, broad above, narrow below; con- vex, behind, for the advantageous origin of the mufcles that move the fpine and thigh backwards ; and concave before, for enlarging the cavity of the pelvis. Four tranfverfe lines, of a colour different from the reft of the bone which are feen on its fore part, are the marks of divifion of the five different bones of which It confifts in young perfons.

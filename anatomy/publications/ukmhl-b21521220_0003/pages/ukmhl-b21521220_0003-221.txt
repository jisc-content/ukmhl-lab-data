Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 179 a long foflfa, for lodging the intercoftal veflels and nerves ; on each fide of M'hich there is a ridge, to which the inter' coital mufcles are fixed. The fofla is not obfervablc, how- ever, at either end of the ribs ; for, at the pollerior or root, the vellels have not yet reached the ribs *, and, at the fore- end, they arc fplit away into branches, to ferve the parts between the ribs: Which plainly teaches furgeons one r;a- fon of the greater fafety of performing the operation of the empyema towards the fides of the thorax, than either near the back or the breafl. At the pollerior end (n) of each rib, a^little head is formed, which is divided by a middle ridge into two plain or hollow furfaccs; the lowell of which is the broadell and deepell in moll of them. The two plains are joined to the bodies of two different vertebrae, and the ridge for- ces itfelf into the intervening cartilage A little way from this head, we find on the external furface, a fmall cavity, where mucilaginous glands are lodged ; and round the head, the bone appears fpongy, where the capfular liga- ment of the articulation is fixed. Immediately beyond this a flatted tubercle rifes, with a fmall cavity at, and roughnefs about, its root, for the articulation of the rib wkh the tranfverfe procefs of the lowell of the two verte- brae, with the bodies of which the head of the rib is join- ed. Advancing farther on this epcternal furface, we ob- ferve in moll of the ribs another fmaller tubercle. Into which ligaments conne£ling the ribs to each other, and to the tranfverfe procefTes of the vertebrae and portions of the longiffimus dorfi, are inferted.—Beyond this the ribs ar? made flat by the facro-lumballs mufcle, which is inferted into the part of this flat furface farthell from the fpine, where each rib makes a confiderable curve, called by fome ife angle.—Then the rib begins to turn broad, and conti- Z nues (s) Kujrtoy, R^nilu?.-

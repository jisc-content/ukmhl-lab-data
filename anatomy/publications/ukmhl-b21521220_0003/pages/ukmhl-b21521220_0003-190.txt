-148 OF THE SKELETON. Part I. finuofities, into wliich the ligaments that conned this bone to the following one are fixed. The fuperior oblique procefs of ‘ this atlas are large, oblong, hollow, and more horizontal than in any other vertebra They rife more in their external than inter- nal brim ; by which their articulations with the condyloid proctlTcs of the os occipitis are firmer Under the ex- ternal edge of each of thefe oblique procefles is the foffa, or deep open channel, in which the vertebral arteries make the circular turn, as they are about to enter the great fo- ramen of the occipital bone, and where the tenth pair of nerves go out.——In feveral bodies I have feen this fofla covered with bone.- Fhe inferior oblique proceffes, extending from within outwards and downwards, are large, concave, and circular. So that this vertebra, contrary to the other fix, receives the bones with which it is articulated^ both above and below. The tranfverfe procefles here are not much hollowed oy forked; but are longer and lai^r than thofe of any other vertebra of the neck, from the origin and infertion of fe- veral mufcles ; of which thofe that ferve to move this ver- tebra on the fecond have a confiderable lever to ad with, becaufe of the diftance of their infertion from the axis of revolution. The hole for the fpinal marrow is larger in this than in any other vertebra, not only on account of the marrow being larged here, but alfo to prevent its being hurt by the motions of this vertebra on the fecond one. Tins large hole, and the long tranfverfe procefles, make this the broadeft vertebra of the neck. The condyles of the os occipitis move forwards and back- wards in the fuperior oblique proceflTes of this vertebra ; but from the figure of the bones forming thefe joints, it appears,

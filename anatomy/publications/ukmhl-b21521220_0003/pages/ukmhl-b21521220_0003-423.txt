Part ir. 381 OF MUSCULAR MOTION. nerve. Moreover, on irritating the nerve or fpinal mar- row, even in an animal that has been dead for fome time, the inufcle or mufcles which have nervous branches from thofe parts are mofl: vehemently convulfed. When the nerve of any mufcle is cut or tied, or the bafis of the fpi- nal narrow comprefled, or that part of the brain from •whence the nerve has its origin, the mufcle becomes para- 'lytic, and languillies, and cannot by any force be recalled into an a£l:ion fimilar to the vital one. But if the ligature be taken off from the nerve, the force by which the mufcle is put into a£lion is again recovered. The nerve being ir- ritated below the place where it is cut, the mufcle to which that nerve goes is contrafted. This appears from nume- rous experiments, efpecially thofe made on the phrenic and recurrent nerves. This force, called vis fiervea, is not the lame with the vis infita. The former comes to the mufcle from without: whereas the other refides conftantly in the mufcl6 itfclf. The nervous power ceafes when life is deftroyed ; the other appears, from certain experiments, to remain for fome time after death: it is alfo fupprefled by tying a ligature upon the nerve, by hurting the brain, or by taking opium. The vis infita fuffers nothing from all thefe circumftances ; it remains after the nerve is tied : it continues in the in- tellines though they be taken out of the body and cut in pieces: it appears with great ftrength in fuch animals as are deftitute of brain ; that part of the body is moved which has no feeling ; and the parts of the body feel which are without motion. The will excites and removes the I nervous power, but has no power over the vis infita. In the motiort of the mufcles, whether owing to the vis infita or the vis nervea^ the fibres are contracted towards the middle of their belly, and recede from one another outwards; they are alfo diverfified with various tranfverfe wrinkles»

Part I. 78 OF THE SKELETON. there is a rifing of the os petrofum, which fome authors have efleemed a procefs : and, from the appearance it makes with the ftyliform, have named it vaginalis.—Others again have, under the name of auditory procefs, reckoned among the external proccfles, that femicircular ridge, which run- ning between the root of the maftoid and zygomatic pro- ceflcs, forms the under part of the external meatus audttorius. The JmuoJities or depreffions on the external furface of each temporal bone are thefc : A long fofl'a at the inner and back part of the root of the mammary procefs, where the pollerior head .of the digaftric mufcle has its origin. Immediately before the root of the zygomatic procefs, a confidcrable hollow is left for lodging the crotaphite mufcle—^—Between the zygomatic, auditory, and vaginal proceflcs, a large cavity is formed; through the middle of which, from top to bottom, a fiflure is obfervable, into which part of the ligament that fecures the articulation of the lovA'er jaw with this bone is fixed. The fore-part of the cavity being lined with the fame: cartilage which covers the tubercle before it, receives the condyle of the jaw ; arid in the back-part a fmall fhare of the parotid gland, and a cellular fatty fubftance, are lodged.—At the infide of the root of the ftyloid apophyfe, there is'a thimble-like cavi- ty, where the beginning of the internal jugular v€in, or end of the lateral finus is lodged.—And as the finufes of the two Tides are frequently of unequal fize, fo one of thefe cavities is as often larger than the otlier (g) Round the external meatus auditdrius, feveral finuafities are formed for receiving the cartilages and ligaments of the ear, and for their firm adhefion.j: Tlie holes that^ commonly appear on the outfide of each of thefe bones, and are proper to each of them, are five. -—I'he {£) HunauW. in Mem. de I’acad. des fcienccs, 17 3°- 3

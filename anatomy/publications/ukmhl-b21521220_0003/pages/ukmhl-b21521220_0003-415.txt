( 373 ) o V MUSCULAR MOTION. , s Motion in the human body i3^ not performed by , one individual organ. In every animal and' vege- table fibre, even in hair, feathers, membranes, the cellu- lar texture, and in the humid mufcular fibre, in flrort, in animal and vegetable gluten, there is a contra£Vde or elaftic power, which preferves the fibre in its natural (late, pre- venting it'from being too much extended, and reftoring it again to its proper dimenfions, w^en the ftretching power is removed. This power never ceafes endeavouring to bring the elementary particles into the clofeft conta£l that the mechanifm of the part can admit. It continues even many days after death •, fo that fibres of a divided mufclc contrail: towards each extremity, leaving a wide gap in the middle. An artery, when cut, lihewife contrails itfelf in length. , This force may be called vis mortua, becaufe it conti- nues to be efficacious after death, and is different from the powers of life. In the living animal, indeed, it is foine- what brifker; for, both from cold and fear, the fkin trembles, grows harder,-and has-its papillse ereited ; and along with this hardnefs it contrails itfelf in length. A- gain, the cellular fibres are animated with this perpe- tual nifus to fhorten, always endeavouring to contrail themfelves. Hence, when the Ikin or any other mem- bran^

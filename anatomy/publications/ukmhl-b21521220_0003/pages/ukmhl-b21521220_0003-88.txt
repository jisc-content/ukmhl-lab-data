46 OF THE BONES PanL ' s CartUages feem to be principally kept from ofTifyingj ei- ther by being fubjedled to alternate motions of flexion and : extenfion, the efFe£ls of which are very cjiflerent from any [ kind of Ample preflure ; or by being conftantly moiftened [o). Thus the cartilages on the articulated ends of the great bones : of the limbs> and the moveable ones placed between the i moving bones in fame articulations, which are obliged to ; fuffer many and difiercnt flexions, and are plentifully ■ moillened, fcarce ever change into bone; while thofe of the ribs and larynx are often ofTified.——The middle angular part of the cartilages of the ribs, wl^ich is conllantly in an alternate ftate of flexion and extenfion, by being moved in i refpiration, is always the laft of becoming bony. In the larynx, the epiglottis, which is oftener bended and more moillened than the other four cartilages, is feldom ofllfied, while the others as feldom efcape it in adults. The cartilages fubfervient to bones are fometimes found on the ends of bones which are joined to no other; but are never wanting on the ends and in the cavities of fuch bones as are defigned for motion (p). Cartilages alfo are interpoftd between fuch other cartilages as cover the heads and cavities of articulated bones; nay, they are alfo placed between immoveable bones. The ufes of cartilages, fo far as they regard bones, are, to allow, by their fmoothnefs, fuch bones as are defigned for motion, to Aide eafily, and without detrition^ while,''by their flexibility, they accommodate themfelves to the feve- ral figures necefl'ary in different motions, and, by their elafticity, they recover their natural pofition and fhape as loon as the preffure is removed. This fpringy force may alio render the motion of the joints more expeditious, and may likewife Icflen the fliocks in running, jumping, 3 (o) Havers Ofleolog.

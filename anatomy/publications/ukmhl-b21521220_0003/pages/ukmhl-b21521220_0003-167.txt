BOl^ES OF THE HEAD. Chap. IT. 125 while the condyle of the fame fide remains in the cavity ; or, if both condyles are on the tubercles, when the jaw is moved obliquely to a fide, the condyle of the fide to which the motion is made Hides back from the tubercle to the ca- vity. When the mouth is opened by the defcent of the lower jfiw, the fore-par t of it, where the deprefling mufcles are fixed, is drawn backwards, as well as downwards, while rsfiftance is made to the angles moving backwards by the rnafleter and internal pterygoid mufcles, and at the fame time, the external pterygoid draws the condyles and their moveable cartilages forwards; and therefore, when the mouth is opened, the condyles are carried forwards upon the tubercles, and the axis of motion of the bone is a little above its angles. But in this fituation there is lefs refin- ance, than in any other, to the condyles luxating forwards ; a difeafe which feldom happens, except when people are gaping too wide ; and therefore the common practice of nurfes, who fupport the jaw of infants when they are yawn- ing, is reafonable—In chewing, there is a fucceffion of the motions above deferibed (at). Here a general remark may be made, that wherever moveable cartilages are found in joints, either the articu- lated bones are of fuch a figure, or fo joined and fixed by their ligaments, that little motion would be allowed with- out fuch cartilages •, or elfe fome motions are neceflary to the right ufe of the member, which the form of the arti- culation would not otherwife admit of. This will more fully appear after the other joints with fuch cartilages are deferibed. In a child born to the full time, the lower jaw is com- pofed of two bones, connedbed by a thin cartilage in the •middle of the chin, which gradually oflifies, and the two bones (k) For a more full account of tills articulation, vij.

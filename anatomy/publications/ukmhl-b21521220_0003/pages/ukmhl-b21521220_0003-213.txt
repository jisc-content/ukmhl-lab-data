Chap.ir. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 171 if- —Immediately below this procefs, a fimiofity is formed ' for the tendon of the mufculus obturator internus. In a recent fubjeft this part of the bone, which fcrves as a pul> ley on which the obturator mufcle plays, is covered with a ligamentous cartilage, that, by two or three fmall ridges, points out the interftices of the fibres in the* tendon of this mufcle.—The outer furface of the bone at the root of this fpinous procefs is made hollow by the pyriformis or iliacus externus mufcle. Below the finuofity for the obturator mufcle, is the great knob or tuberofity, covered w'ith cartilage or tendon (s). The upper part of the tuberofity gives rife to the in- ferior gemellus mufcle. To i ridge at the infide of this the external or pofterior facrofciatic ligament is fo fixed, that between it, the internal ligament, and the finuofity of the os ifchium, a paflage is left for the internal obturator ‘ mufcle. ^The upper thick fmooth part of the tuher^ called by fome its dorfum, has two oblique impreffions on it. The inner one gives origin to the long head of the bi- ceps flexor tibiae, and feminervofus mufcles; and the fe- mimembranofus rifes from the exterior one,-, which reaches higher and nearer the acetabulum than the other The low'er, thinner, more fcabrous part of the knob which bends forwards, is alfo marked with two flat furfaces j whereof the internal is what we lean upon in fitting, and the external gives rife to the larged hdt^d of the triceps adduftor femoris. Between the external margin of the tu- berofity and the great hole of the os innominatum, there i-r is frequently an obtufe ridge extended down from the ace- tabulum, which gives origin to tlie quadratus femoris- — As the tuber advances forwards, it becomes fmaller, and is rough, for the origin of the mufculus tranfverfalis and ^ eredlor penis.--The fmall leg of it, w’hich mounts upw'ards ■Y 2 to (a) Wyiflq^w, Erpofit.

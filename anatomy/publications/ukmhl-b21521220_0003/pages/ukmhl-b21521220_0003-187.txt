Chap. II. M5 BONES OF THE HEAD. uofis, and a proper method of cure may be eafiJy contrived, which mufl; vary as to the internal medicines, according to the different caufes on which the difeafe depends : But one general indication mufl be purfued by furgeons •, which is, to countera£f the bending force, by increafing the com- prcffion on the convex part^f the curvature, and dlminifliing it on the concave fide. The manner of executing which in particular cafes mufl be different, and requires a very accurate examination of the circumflances both of the difeafe and pa- tient. In many fuch cafes I have found fome fimple diredlions, as to poftures in which the patient’s body fhould be kept, of very great advantage. Though the true vertebrae agree in the general ftruc- ture which I have hitherto deferibed ; yet, becaufe of ftve- fal fpecialties proper to a particular number, they are commonly divided into three claffes, viz. cervicaly dorfaly and lumbar. The CERVICAL (at) are the feven uppermofl vertebrae ; which are diflinguiflied from the reft by thefe marks.—— Their bodies are fmaller and more folid than any others ; and flatted on the fore-part, to make way for the cCfopha- gus; or rather this flat figure is owing to the preffure of that pipe, and to the adlion of the longi colli and anterior re£li mufcles. They are alfo flat behind, where fmall pro- eeffes rife, to which the Internal ligaments are fixed. The upper furface of the body of each vertebra is made hollow, by a flanting thin procefs which is raifed on each fide : The lower furface is alfo hollowed, but in a different manner for here the pofterior edge is raifed a little, and the anterior one is confiderably produced.—Hence vet fee how the car- tilages between thofe bones are. firmly connefted, and their articulations are fecure.

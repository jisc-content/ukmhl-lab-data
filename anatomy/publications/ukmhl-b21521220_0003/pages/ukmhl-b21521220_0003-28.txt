xviii Compendious View of the Introd. and are fpread over all the parts of the body by filaments and ramifications. Each nervous rope may be confidered as a membranous vcflel, the cavity of which is filled by a great number of membranous longitudinal fepta, and by medullary filaments whn;h lie between the fepta. I are bundles of fibres, called by-anatomifts fibrte motrices, of a reddiflr colour, and of different lengths. The middle portion of the moving fibres is the principal, and differs from the extremities in being red, thick, foft, and capable of contraÂ£Hon. Tliis middle portion of each moving fibre is faid to be flefhy, and forms what is properly called fe/Is. The extre- mities are called tendinous^ and the fubftance formed by them tendons. Glands are clufters or moleculac, difUnguifliable from all the other parts of the body by their form, confidence, tex- ture, and connedlion. They are, in general, compofed of arteries, veins, nerves, and other particular veffels, and of a fubdance which u- nities all thefe together in their different folds, contor- tions, and intertextures, all inveded by a membranous co- vering. The office of glands is to feparate from the mafs of blood, by means of certain fecretory veffels, fluids, which they difeharge, either immediately, or by other veffels term- ed excretory ; and thefe fluids are cither accumulated in particular refervoirs, collected in the common cavities, or forced out of the body. ' Fat and marrow are equivocal terms. By the fird we ge- nerally underdand an oily, feft, white, or yellowiffi ffib- ftance, of different confidences, colle6led between the flein and the mufcles, in the interdices of the mufclcs about the vifeera, &c. and compofed partly of a ccllulous or fpongy fubdance,

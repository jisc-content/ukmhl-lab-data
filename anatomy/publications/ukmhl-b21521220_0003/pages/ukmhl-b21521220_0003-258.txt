OF THE SKELETON. 2i6 Part t. fs an oblong concave fquare, for receiving the following bone. The inferior furface is formed into a pulley; the two protuberant fides of which are external and internal. On this pulley the firft bone of the thumb is moved. At the external fide of the external protuberance*, a fmall oblong fmooth furface is formed by the os metacarpi indi- cts. The fore-part of the trapezium is prominent in the palmj and near to the external fide has a finuofity in ir^ where the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is lodged ; on the ligamentous (heath of which the tendon of the flexor tertii internodii pollicis plays: And (till more externally the bone is fcabrous, where the tranfverfe ligament of the wrifl; is connetled, the abduclor and flexor primi internodii pollicis have their origin, and ligaments go out to the firft tione of the thumb. Os trapezoides {g), fo called from the irregular quadran- gular figure of its back part, is the fmalleft bone of the wrifl; except the pififorme. The figure of it is an irregu- lar cube. It has a fmall hollow furface above, by which ' it joins the fcaphoides; a long convex one internally, where it is contiguous to the trapezium ; a fmall external one, for its conjun£tion wdth the os magnum; and an in*^ ferior convex furface, the edges of which are, however, fo raifed before and behind, that a fort of pulley is formed, w'here it fuftains the os metacarpi indicis. Os magnum {.h), fo called becaufe it is the largeft bone of the carpus, is oblong, having four quadrangular fides, with a round upper end, and a triangular plain one below. The round head is divided by a fmall rifing, oppofite to the conne<flion of the os fcaphoides and lunare, which to- gether form the cavity for receiving it. On the infide a fhort'plain furface joins the os magnum to the trapezoides.’ On the outfidc is a long narrow concave furface, where it b {g) Trapezium, multangnlum minus. {h) Maximum, capitatum.

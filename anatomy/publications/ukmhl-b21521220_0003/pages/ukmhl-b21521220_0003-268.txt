Part I OF THE SKELETON. 22(5 diftinguifliing marks ; and therefore the fecond and third phalanx of the fingers enjoy only flexion and extenfion. The upper end of this third phalanx is a cartilage in a ripe child ; and is only an epiphyfe after, till the full growth of the body. All the difference of the phalanges of the feyeral fingers confills iri their magnitude. The bones of the middle finger (r) being the longed and larged,—thofe of the fore- finger (j) come next to that in thicknefs, but not in length, for thofe of the ring-finger (/) are a little longer. The little finger («) has the fmalled bones. Which difpofitlon is the bed contrivance for holding the larged bodies ; becaufe the longed fingers are applied to the middle larged periphery of fuch fubdances as are of a fpherical figure (,v).

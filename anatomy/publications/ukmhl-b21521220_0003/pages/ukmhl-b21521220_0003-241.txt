Chap. II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 199 The inferted: from the external, one head of the biceps flexor cubiti rifes; and from the lower one, the coraco-brachialis has its origin. At the upper part of the root of this pro- cefs, immediately before the femilunar cavity, a fmooth tu- bercle appears, where a ligament from the clavicle is fixed. From all the external fide of this coracoid apophyfe, a broad ligament goes out, which becomes narrower where it is fixed to the acromion. The fliarp pain, violent in- flammation, and tedious cure of contufions in this part, are probably owing to thefe tendons and ligaments being hurt. From the cervix fcapulte the third procefs is produced. The fore-part of this is formed into a glenoid cavity (J), which is of the fhape of the longitudinal fedlion of an egg, being broad below and narrow above. Bet\veen the brims of this hollow and the fore-part of the root of tli^e fpine, a large finuofity is left for the tranfmilfion of the fu- pra and infra fpinati mufcles ; and on the upper part of thefe brims we may remark a fmooth furface, where the fecond head of the biceps flexor cubiti has its origin. The root of the fupercilia is rough all round, for the firmer adhe- fion of the capfular ligament of the articulation, and of the cartilage which is placed on thefe brims, w’here it is thick, but becomes very thin as it is continued towards the middle of the cavity, which it lines all over. The medullary veflels enter the fcapula near the bafe of the fpine. The fuhjlance of the fcapula, as in all other broad flat bones, is cellular, but of an unequal thicknefs : for the neck and third procefs are thick and ftrong ; the inferior cofta, and fpine, and coracoid procefs, are of a middle thick- nefs ; and the body is fo preffed by the mufebs, as to be- come thin and diaphanous.

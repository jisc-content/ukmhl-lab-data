The one be- hind is nearly a triangle, but not complete at the inferior angle, and is joined to the os naviculare. The external flde is an oblong fquare divided as it were by a diagonal } the upper half of it is fmooth, for its conjundion with the os cuboides: The other is a fcabrous hollow,^ and in its fuperior anterior angle a fmall fmooth imprelTion is made by the os metatarfl of the toe next to the little one. The internal fide of this bone is alfo quadrangular, with the fore-part of its edge made flat and fmooth by the os metatarfl of the toe next to the great one, and the back-part is alfo flat and fmooth where the os-euneiforme medium is contiguous to it. The fore-part of this bone is an oblong triangle, for fuS;aining the os metatarfl of the middle toe; Os cuneiforme medium, or mlmm^tn, is ftill more exa£Ily the fliape of a wedge than tlie former. Its fipper part is fquare ;—its internal fiile has a flat fmooth furface above and behind, for its conjundtion with the following bone; with a fmall rough fofla below ; and a confiderable fliare of it is rough and hollow. The external fide is fmooth and a little hollowed, where it is contiguous to the lafl; defcrib- ed bone;——Behind, this bone is triangular, where it is arti- culated with the os naviculare ; and it is alfo triangular at its fore-part, where it is contiguous to the os metatarfl of the tot? next to the great one. Os cuneiforme^ maximum^ or internum, differs from the two former in its fituation, which is more oblique than theirs. Befides, its broad thick part is placed below, t and the fmall thin point is above and outwards ; while its under broad furface is concave, for allowing a fafe pafliige to the flexor of the great toe.

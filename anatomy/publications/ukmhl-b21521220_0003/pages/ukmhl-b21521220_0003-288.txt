.24^ OF THE SKELETON. Part I. to the fore-part of the aflragalus.—Behind the pofterior of thefe fmooth furfaces, which is the largeft, a fmall fmuo- fity is made by the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus j at the fore-part of which a fmall rough protuberance ap- pears, that gives rife to the mufculus extenfor digitorum brevis. The external fide of this bone is fiat, with a fuperficial fofla running horizontally, in which the tendon of the, muf- culus peronaeus longus is lodged. The Internal fide of the heel-bone is hollowed, for lodging the origin of the mafia cornea Jac. Sylvii, and for the fafe palTage of tendons, nerves, and arteries. Under the fide of the internal fmooth concavity, a particular groove is made by the ten- don of the flexor polJicis longus ; and from the thin pro- tuberance of this internal fide the cartilaginous ligament that fupports the aftragalus, goes out to the os naviculare; on which ligament, and on the edge of this bone to which it is fixed, the groove is formed for the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus. The lower furface of this bone is prefied flat at the back- part, by the weight of our bodies; and immediately before this plane, there are two tubercles, 'from the Internal of which the mufculus abdu£tor pollicis, flexor digitorum fub- limis, as alfo part of the aponeurofis plantaris, and of the abdudtor minimi digiti, have their origin j' and the other part of the abdu£lor minimi digiti and aponeurofis plantaris rifes from the external. Before thefe protuberances this bone is concave, for lodging the flexor mufcles ; and at its fore-part we may obferve a rough depreflfion, from which, -and a tubercle behind it, the ligament goes out that prevents this bone from being feparated from the os cuboides. The fore-part of the os calcis is formed into an oblong pulley-like fmooth furface, which is circular at its upper external

The ilrength of thefe crofs bridges is very remarkable in the three upper bones, and is well proportioned to the Incum- bent w'eight of the trunk of the body, which thefe bridges fuRaln in a tranfverfe, confequently an unfavourable, fitua- tion, when the body is ere£l. There are only two oblique procefles of the os facrum j one aanding out on each fide from the upper part of the lira bone.—Their plain eredl furfaces face backwards, and are articulated with the inferior oblique procefles of the laa vertebra of the loins, to which each of thefe procefles is connedled by a flrong ligament, which rifes fiom a fca- brous cavity round their roots, where mucilaginous glands are alfo lodged.—Inflead of the other oblique procefles of this bone, four rough tubercles are to be feen on each fide of its furface behind, from which the mufculus facer has its origin. The tranfverfe procefles here are all grown togctlier in- to c.ie large flrong oblong procefs on each fide; which, fo far as it anfwers to the firfl three bones, is very thick, and divided into two irregular cavities by a long perpendi- cular ridge.—The foremofl of the two cavities has com- monly a thin cartilaginous Ikin covering it in the recent fubjeil, and is adapted to the -unequal protuberance of the os ilium ; and a flrong ligament conneifls the circumfe- rence of thefe furfaces of the two bones.—The cavity be- hind Is divided by a tranfverfe ridge into two, where flrong. ligamentous

6 OFTIIEBONES PartU > Hen a very great difference in the thicknefs and ftrength of the perlofteum of different bones, and even of the different parte of the fame bone. The intertial layer is every where nearly of a fimilar flrufture, and has its fibres in the fame dire£lion with thofe of the bone to which they are conti- guous. Ought not then the name periojieum to be applied, ftridlly fpeaking, only to this internal layer, to which the others are joined in an uncertain manner and number ? Some authors [b) endeavour to prove the internal layers of fibres of the periofleum to be derived from the dura ma- ter : For, fay they, fince the membrane covering the fkull is plainly a produ£Hon or continuation of the dura mater, which paffes out between the futures} and lince there are mufcles on the head, as well as in other parts, which might furnifh a periofleum; it is needlefs to affign different ori- gins to membranes which have the fame texture and ufes. They add farther, in proof of this dodlrine, that the pe- riofteum extends itfelf along the ligaments of the articu- lations from one bone to another; and therefore is con- tinued from its origin over all the bones of the body. While anatomifts were fond of the hypothefis of all mem- branes being derived from one or other of the two that cover the brain, a difpute of this kind might be thought of confequence : but now that the hypothefis is negledled as ufe- lefs, it is needlefs to examine the arguments for or againfl it. Except where mufcles, cartilages, or ligaments, are in- ferted into the periofleum, its external furface is connedled'^ to the furrounding parts by thin cellular membranes, which can eafily be llretched confiderably, but fljorten themfclves whenever the firetching force is removed.. When thefe membranes are cut off or broken, they collapfe into fuch a fir.all fpace, that the furface of the periofleum feems fmooth and equal. When (i) Havers, Oftcolog. Nov. dife. I. p. l6-

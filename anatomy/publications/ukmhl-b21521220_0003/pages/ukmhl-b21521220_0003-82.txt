Part I. 40 OF THE BONES often confined or enlarged by fome other caufc not imme- diately depending on the frame of the two furfaces of the bones forming the particular joint, which then is confi- dered. The firll fpecies of the diarthrofis, viz. the enartkrofiSy or ball and focket, I would define more generally than above, That articulation where a round head of one bone is received into a cavity of another; and confequently, without fome foreign impediment, is capable of motion to all Tides. Examples of this kind are to be feen in the ar- ticulation of the thigh-bone and ofl'a innominata; arm- bone and fcapula ; aftragalus and os naviculare ; magnum of the wrift with the fcaphoides and lunare; firfl bone of the thumb with the fecond, &c. The fecond fort, or the arthrodia^ differing from the cnarthrofis, in the preceding account, only in the cavity^s being more fuperficial, (which makes no effential differ- ence, efpecially that, in the recent fubje£l, cartilages or ligaments fupply the deficiency of bone), ought, in my opinion, to be called with Vefalius (A), that articulation of two bones adapted for motion, where it is not at firfl fight obvious which of the two has the head or cavity, or where they are joined by plain furfaces, or neatly fo ; fuch is the conjumSlion of the clavicle with the fcapula, offa cu- nciformia with the os naviculare, metatarfal bones with the’ offa cuneiformia, &c. From the nature of this fort of joint it is plain, that very great motion cannot be allowed, without the bones going further out of their natural fitua- tion than is convenient or fafe. G'wglimus^ I would reckon that articulation by the form of which the motion of the joined bones mufl be chiefly confined to two diredlions, as hinges of doors are. The firfl fpecies of this is the trochoi'desy when one bone (h) De corp, human, fabrica, lib. I. cap, turns

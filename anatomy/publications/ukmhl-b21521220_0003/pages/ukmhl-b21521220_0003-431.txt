Part II. OF MUSCULAR MOTION. 3^9 generally placed round any of the cavities of the body, pro- pel the blood contained in that cavity, and prefs it towards the heart. By too much exercife or a£lion, the raufcles themfelves grow hard and tendinous on all fidcs; they ren- der the parts upon which they are incumbent, cartilaginous, or elfe change thofe which are membranous into a bony nature; they increafe the roughnefs, protuberances, and procelTes, of the bones which lie next to them, and exca- vate their flat parts; they dilate the cells of the diploe, and incurvatc the bones. , ' The mufcle which the ftimulus has ceafed to irritate, or for the action of which the mind has no occafion, is re- laxed, and grows foft; its wrinkles grow plain ; its fibres are rendered longer, receding from the middle towards the fixed extremities; and its fwelling falls. Whatever is the caufe of additional contradUon is then taken away ; but the vis Infita remains. It may be afked, What becomes of the fpirit that is fent from the brain ? A part of it perhaps exhales; a part of it may be fufpecled to adhere to the fi- bre ; and thus it happens that the mufcles grow ftrong with exercife, and their brawny parts become thicker. “ The three noted clafTes of animal powers, elaJHcityy irritabilityy and feiiftbility, Dr Wrifberg obferves, have been and are yet too much confounded, although it is no difficult talk to diftinguifh thefe afFedtions from one ano- ther. The elaflicity and cohefion of the fibres, which in different degrees, are found in every part of the body, was fully known to Bellini, Baglivi, Stahl, Pacchioni, Juncker &c. That power, known to Stahl’s followers under the appellation of tone, has no fimilarity to irritability, fenfil bility, and what is called vital power. It either alone per- forms the various a£lions of the animal and vegetable bo- dy, or adds ftrength and vigour to them: the former is mauifell in the motion of the ribs and cartilages ; and the latter

Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. >31 In a neW-born infant, only the outer flicll of the body of thefe teeth is hardened. Afterwards, when the fta- mina of two fets are formed, each has its own focket, thofe neareil to the edge of the gums being placed more for- ward, and the others are lodged farther back within the jaw- boner. Canini (m), from the refemblance to dogs tulks, are one an each Gde of the incifores in each jaw. The two in the upper jaw are called eye-teeth, from the communication of nerves which is faid to be between them and the eyes. The two in the lower jaw are xiTKvncA cmgular or wike-teeth, becaufe they fupport the angles of the mouth. The canini are broader, longer,- and llronger, than the incifores Their bafes are formed into a fharp-edge^ as the incifores are; only that the edge rifes into a point at the middle. Each of them has generally but one long root, though fometimes they have two (Â«,). TluTroots are crook- ed towards the end. The canini of the upper jaw are lar- ger, longer, and with more crooked roots, than thofe of the under Jaw. The form of their bafe is fit both for piercing and cutting, and the long crooked root of each makes it fe- cure in the focket. The canini of a child are in much the fame condition the incifores are. The Deni'es Molares, or Grinders [o), which have got their name bccaufe they grind our food, are generally five in each fide of each jaw, in all twenty. Their bafes are broader, more fcabrous, and with a thinner cortical fubftance, than the other teeth. They have alfo more roots; and as thefe roots generally divaricate from each o- ther, the partitions of the fockets between them bear a R 2 large (ot) KovoJoyrff, Riibrii, fraflolii, collaterals, coliimcllares.'* (n) Fauchard, Chirurgien dentifte, chap, i, ^ (o) .MuXira,, yo/ijoi, yKXTu;, ^;arr')tr, MiixilJarcs, mcnfales, da- vales, buccarimi. /

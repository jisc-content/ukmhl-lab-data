BONES OF THE HEAD. Chap. ir. 8i The internal proper fcramina of each of thefe bones are, firft, the interival meatus auditorius in the pofterior plain fide <!f the petrous procefs. This hole foon divides into two; one of which is the beginn’ng of the aquedu£t of Fallopius; the other ends in feveral very fmall canals (»;) tliat allow a pafThge to the branches of the portio mollis of the feventh pair of nerves, into the veftibul'e and cochlea* Through it alfo an artery is fent, to be dillributed to the organ of hearing.—The fecond hole, which is. on the ante- rior plain fide of the craggy procefs, gives paflage to a re- fledted branch of the fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerve's, which joins the portio dura of the auditory nerve, ■while it is in the aquedutl («), fmall branches of blood- veffels accompanying the nerves, or pafling through fmal- ler hples near it.—The paflirge^of the cutaneous vein into the lateral finus, or of a branch cf the occipital artery, is feen about the middle of the large fofhi for that finus; and the orifice of the canal of the carotid artery is evident at the under part of the point of the petpous procefs. Befides thefe proper holes of the temporal bones which appear on their external and internal furfaces, t|rere are two others in each fide that are common to this bone, and to the occipital and fphenoidal bones ; which fhall be men,- tioned afterwards in the defeription of thefe bi»nes. The upper round part of tire fquamous bones is thin, but equal; while the low petrous part is thick and ftrong, but irregular and unequal, having the dillindlion of tables and diplce confounded, wiih feveral cavities, procefles, and bones within its fubltance, which are parts of the organ of hearing.' lhat a clear idea may be had of this beautiful, but intricate organ, anatomifts generally choofe to demon- llrate all its parts together. 1 tliink the method good ; and L therefore, (m) Valfalva de aure Humana, cap, 3. § n.

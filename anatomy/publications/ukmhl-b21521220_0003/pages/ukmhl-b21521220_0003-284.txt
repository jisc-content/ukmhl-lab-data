Part I. 242 OF THE SKELETON. and the pofterior part is ftretched obliquely from the In- ternal condyle of the thigh outwards, that pofterior part of the crofs ligament prevents the leg from being turned at all inwards ; but it could not'hinder It from turning out- wards almofl; round, was not that motion confined by the lateral ligaments of this joint, which can yield little. This rotation of the leg outwards is of good advantage to,us in crofling our legs, and turning our feet outwards, on feve- ral neceflary occafions ; though It is altogether fit this mo- tion (hould not be very large, to prevent frequent luxa- tions here.—While all thefe motions are performing, tlie part of the tibia that moves Immediately on the condyles is only fo much of it as is within the cartilaginous ring, which by the thicknefs on their outfides make the cavities of the tibia more horizontal j by raifing their external fide where the furface of the tibia Hants downwards. By this means the motions of this joint are more equal and Heady than otherwife they would have been. The cartilages being ca- pable of changing a little their fituation, are fit for doing this good office In the different motions and pollures of the limb, and likewife contribute to make the motions larger and On account of the very large furface of the bones form- ing the joint of the knee, and the many ftrong ligaments, connedling them, luxations feldom liappen here. But thefe very ligaments, the aponeurofis paffing over this joint, and the quantity of fat and mucilaginous glands neceffary for lubricating it, make it more fubje£l: to white fwellings, drop- fies, and fuch other diforders, than any other joint of the body. § 3. ^he FOOT.

Part I. OF THE SKELETON. 210 \ its internal and pollerlor furfaces j where it is alfo made round by the equal preffure of the circumjacent mufcles, particularly of the extenfors of the thumb ; but the fur- faces next to the ulna are flatted and rough, for the ori- gin of the mufcles of the hand ; and both terminate in a common fharp fpine, to which the ftrong ligament ex- tended between the two bones of the fore-arm is fixed. A little below the beginning of the plain furface, on its fore-part, where the flexor mUfcle of the lad joint of the thumb takes its origin, the paflage of the medullary veflels is feen flanting upwards. The radius becomes broader and flatter towards the lower end, efpecially on its fore-part, where its pronator quadratus mufcle is fituated. The lower end of the radius is larger than the fuperior; though not in fiich a difproportion as the upper end of the ulna is larger than its lower endâ€” Its back-part has a flat ftrong ridge in the middle, and foflae on each fide. In a fmall groove, immediately on the outfide of the ridge, the tendon of the extenfor tertii internodii pollicis plays. In a large one beyond this, the tendons of tlie in- dicator and of the common extenfor mufcles- of the fingers pafs. Contiguous to the ulna there is a fmall depreflion made by the extenfor minimi digit!. On the infide of the ridge there is a broad depreflion, which feems again fubdivided, where the two tendons of the bicornis, or ex- tenfor carpi radialis, aie lodged. The internal fide of this end of the radius is alfo hollowed by the extenfors of the firfl and fecond joint of the thumb; immediately above which a little rough furface Ihews where the fupinator ra- dii longus is inferted. The ridges at the fides of the grooves, in which the tendons play, have an annular liga- ment fixed to them, by which the feveral (heaths for the tendons are formed. The fore-part of this end of the ra- dius is alfo deprefled, where the flexors of the fingers and flexor

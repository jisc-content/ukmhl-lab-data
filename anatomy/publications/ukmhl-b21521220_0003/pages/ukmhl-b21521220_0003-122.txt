OF THE SKELETON. Part I. 8o to the temporal and occipital bones; and in feveral fkulls there is no fuch hole. The ufe of it, when found, is for the tranfmiflion of a vein from the external teguments to the lateral finus: But, in fome fubjefts, a branch of the occipital artery pafles through this hole, to ferve the back- part of the dura mater; in others, I have feen two or three fuch holes: but they are oftener w^anting than found. And we may once for all, in general remark, that the largenefs, number, fuuation, and exillence of all fuch holes as for the molt part allow only a paffage for veins from without to the internal receptacles, are very uncertain. The internal furface of the olfa temporum is unequal; the upper circular edge of the fquamous part having nu- merous fmall ridges and furrows for its cohjun£lion with the parietal bones ; and the reft of it is irregularly marked, with the convolutions of the middle part of the brain, and with furrows made by the branches of the arteries of th^ dura mater. From the under part of this internal furface, a larger trailfverfe hard craggy protuberance runs horizontally in- wards and forwards, with a (harp edge above, and two flat lides, one facing obliquely forw'ards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. To the ridge be- tween thefe two fides, the large lateral proccl's of the du- ra mater is fixed. Sometimes a fmall bone, like the fcfamcld, is found between the fmall end of this petrous procefs and,the fphe- noid bone (/). Towards the back-part of the Infide of the temporal bone, a large deep folia is confpicuous, where the lateral finus lies; and frequently on the top of the petrous ridge, a fur- row may be obfeived, where a fmall finus is filuated.

Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. l6^ the pelvis, and the lower part of the Tides of the abdomen. In children, each of thefe bones is evidently divided into three ; which'are afterwards fo intimately united, that fcarce the leaft mark of their former feparation remains ; They are neverthelefs defcribed as confifling each of three bones, to wit, the os ilium, ifchium, and pubis; which I fliall firft defcribe feparately, and then fhall confider what is common to any two of them, or to all the three. Os ILIUM (s), or hauvch-bof:e, is fituated higheft of.the three, and reaches as far down as one third of the great cavity into which the head of the thigh-bone is received. The external fide of this bone is unequally convex, and is called its dorfum ;â€”the internal concave furface is by fomc authors (but improperly) named its c^a. d'he femicircu- lar edge at the higheft part of this bone, which is tipped with a cartilage in the recent fubjeft, is named the fpine^ into which the external or defcending oblique mufcle of the abdomen is inferted ; and from it the internal amend- ing oblique, and the tranfverfe mufcles of the belly, with the glutaeus maximus, quadratus lumborum, and latifiimus dorfi, have their origin. Some writers {t) are of opinion, that it is only the tendinous cruft of all thefe mufcles, and not a cartilage, as is commonly alledged, that covers this bony edge. The ends of the fpine being more prominent than the futface of the bone below them, are therefore; reckoned proceftes From the anterior fpinal procefs, (he fartorius and fafcialis mufcles have their rife, and ^he outer end of the doubled tendon of the external oblique mufcle of the abdomen, commonly called Fallopius'^ or Poupart's ligament, is fixed to it. The infide of the pofte- rior fpinal procefs, and of part of the fpine forward from that,. (j) Aayovov Xfvfay, Scaphium, lumbarc, cluniiinfi, claviiim, anemias.

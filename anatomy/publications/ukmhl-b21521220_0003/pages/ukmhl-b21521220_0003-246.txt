OF THE SKELETON. PartL 204 this, a finuofity is made by the (horter head of the bi- cornis mufcle, upon which the mufcular nerve is placed. The internal condyle is more pointed and protuberant than the external, to give origin to fome part pf the flexor car- pi radialis, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum fublimis, and flexor carpi ulnaris. Between the two condyles, Is the trochlea or pulley ; which confifts of two lateral protuberances, and a middle ca- vity, that are fmooth and covered with cartilage. When the fore-arm is extended, the tendon of the internal brachiseus mufcle is lodged in the fore-part of the ca- vity of this pulley. The external protuberance, •\vhich is lefs than the other, has a fharp edge behind ; but forwards, this ridge is obtufe, and oply feparated from the little head, already defcribed, by a fmall fofla, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move. The internal protuberance ,6f the pulley is largeft and higheft; and therefore, in the motions of the ulna upon If, that bone ■would be inclined outwards, were it not fupported by. the radius on that fide. Between this Internal protuberance and condyle, a finuofity may be remarked, where the ulnar nerve paflTes. The fuhjlance and the Internal ftrudilure of the os hume- ri is the fame, and difpofed in the fame way, as in other long bones. The round head at the upper end of this bone is ariicu.^ latcd with the glenoid cavity of the fcapula ; which being fuperficial, and having long ligaments, allows the arm a free and extenfive motion. Thefe ligaments are, how- ever, confiderably ftrong* For befides the common cap- fular one, the tendons of the mufcles perform the office, and have been defcribed under the name of ligaments. Then the acromion and coracoid procefs, with the ftrong broad ligaments ftretched between them, fecure the articu- lation

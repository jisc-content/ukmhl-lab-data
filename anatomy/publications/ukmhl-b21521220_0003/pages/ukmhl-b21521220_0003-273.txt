Chap. II. INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 231 goes out to the upper part of the fibula.—Round this lower end of the thigh-bone, large holes are found, into which the ligaments for the fecurity of the joint are fixed, and blood- vellels pafs to the internal fubftance of the bone. All the procelTcs of the femur are cartilaginous in new-born children; and afterwards become fmall apophyfes, with large cpiphyfes. The thigh-bone being articulated above 'with the aceta- bulum of the oflii innominata, which affords its round head a fecure and extenfive play, can be moved to every fide ; but is reftrained in its motion outwards by the high brims of'the cavity, and by the round ligament; for other- wife the head of the bone would have been fretjuently thruff out at the breach of the brims on the infide, which allows the thigh to move confiderably inwards. The body of this bone enjoys little or no rotatory motion, though the head mofl commonly moves round its own axis; becaufe 'the oblique progrefs of the neck and head from the bone is fuch, that the rotatory motion of the head can only bring the body of the bone forwards and backwards. Nor is the head, as in the arm, ever capable of being brought to a flraight dire£Uon with its body ; fo far liowever, as the head can move within the cavity back- wards and forwards, the reft of the bone may have a partial rotation. When the thigh-bone refills the adlions of its mufcles more than the trunk of the body can then do, as in {landing, thefe mufcles have their effecl on the trunk, caufing it to bend forward, raifing it up, inclining it to the one or the other fide, twilling it obliquely, &c. for which the rolling of the acetabula of the offa innominata on the round heads of the thigh-bones is well fitted.- The os femoris is articulated below to the tibia and rotula in the manner afterwards to be defcrlbed.

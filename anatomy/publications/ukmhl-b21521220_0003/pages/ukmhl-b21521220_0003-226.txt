Parf I. OF THE SKELETON. 184 JoUd, the pectoral^ tlie iujified: But ihefe names arc of fo little ufe, that they are now generally neglecled. The firft rib of each fide is fo fituated, that the flat fides are above and below, while one edge is placed inwards and the other outwards, or nearly fo: therefore fufficient fpace is left above it for the fubclavian veflels and mufcles; and the broad concave furf^ace- is oppofed to the lungs. But then, in confequence of this fituation, the channel for the intercoftal veflels is not to 'be found ; and the edges are differently formed from all the other, except the fecond ; the lower one being rounded, and the other fharp. . The head of this rib is not divided into two plain furfaces by a middle ridge, becaufe it is only articulated with the firlt vertebra of the thorax. Its cartilage is oflified in a- dults, and is united to tl>e fternum at right angles. This fnfl; rib frequently has a ridge rifing near the middle of its poflevior edge, where one of the heads of the fcale- iius mufcles rifes. Farther forward it is flatted, or fometimes deprefled by the clavicle. 'â€¢The fifth, fixth, and feventh, or rather the fixth, fc- vcnth, eighth, and fonjetimes the fifth, fixth, feventh^ eighth, and ninth ribs, have their cartilages at leaft contigu- ous ; and they are frequently joined to each other by crofs cartilages ; and mofh commonly the cartilages of the eighth, ninth, and tenth, are connected to the former and to each o- ther by firm ligaments. , The eleventh, and fometimes the tenth rib, has no tu- bercle for its articulation with the tranfverfe procefs of the vertebra, to which it is only loofcly fixed by ligaments. The fofla in its lower edge is not fo deep as in tlrffe upper ribs, bccaufe the veflels run more towards the intcrflice between the ribs. Its fore-end is fmaller than its body, and its fliort fmall cartilage is but loofely connetSIcd to t.he cartilage of the rib -above. The

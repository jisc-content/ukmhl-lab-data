Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 9 This bone is articulated above to the laft vertebra of the Joins, in the manner that the lumbar vertebra: are joined ; and therefore the fame motions may be performed here. • The articulation of the loWer-part of the os facrum to the os coccygis, feems well enough a'dapted for allowing con- flderable motion to this lad bone, were it not much confi- ned by llgamehtsi Laterally, the os facrum is joined to the ofTa ilium by an immoveable fynchondrolis, or what almoft deferves the name of a future; For the cartilagi- nous cruft on the furface of the bones is very thin; and both their furfaces are fo fcabrous and unequal, as to be indented into each other ; which makes fuch a drong coti- nedtion, that great force is required to feparate them, after all the mufcles and ligaments are cut.—Frequently the two bones grow together in old fubjedts. The lifts of the os facrum are, to ferve as the common bafe and fupport of the trunk of the body, to guard the nerves proceeding from the end of the fpinal marrow, to defend the back-part of the pelvis, and td afford fufficient origin to the mufcles which move the trunk and thigh. The bones that compofe the os facrum of infants, have their bodies feparated from each ocher by a thick cartilage ; and, in the fame manner as the true vertebra:, each of them confids of a body and two lateral plates, connedted together by cartilages j the ends of the plates feldom being contiguous behind. Os CoceVGis («), or rumf-hone^ is that triangular chain of bones depending from the os facrum; each bone beco- ming fmaller as they defeend, till the laft ends almoft in a point. The os coccygis,is convex behind, and concave before; from which crooked pyramidal figure, which was thouglit to rcfcmble a cuckow’s beak, it has got its name.

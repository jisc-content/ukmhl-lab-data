Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. above Is generally a little rounded; the two lateral angles are more finiflied, but obiufe; and the lower one is ftretched forw'ard in form of a wedge, and thence is calleh by fome the cuneiform procefs.~If one would, however, be very nice in obferving the feveral turns which the edges of the os occipitjs make, five or feven fides, and as many angles of this bone, might be deferibed. • The external furface is convex, except at the cuneiform apophyfe, where It is flatted. At the bafe of this triangu- lar procefs, on each fide of the great hole, but more ad- vanced forwards than the middle of it, the large oblong protuberances, named the condyles, appear, to ferve for the articulation of this bone with the firft vertebra of the neck. The fmooth furface of each of thefe condyloid procefles is longefl; from behind forwards, where, by their oblique fituatlon, they come much nearer to each other than they are at their back-part. Their inner fides are lower than the external, by which they are prevented from Aiding to either fide out of the cavities of the firft verte- bra (/>). In fome fubjedbs, each of thefe plain fmooth furfaces feems to be divided by a fmall rlfing in its middle; and the lower edge of each condyle, next the great fora- men, is difeontinued about the middle, by an intervening notch: Whence fome {q) allcdge, that each of thefe apo- phyfes is made up of two protuberances. Round their root a fmall depreflion and fpongy roughnefs is obferva- ble, where the ligaments for furrounding and fecuring their articulations adhere—Though the motion of the head is performed on the condyles, yet the centre of gra- vity of that globe does not fall between them, but is a good way farther forward ; from whichumeclianifm it is evident, that the mufcles which pull the head back muft be in a conftant ftate of contradion i whiph is ftronger than ^ 2 tll3 {P) Galen. d« ulu part. l!b, la. cap. 7.

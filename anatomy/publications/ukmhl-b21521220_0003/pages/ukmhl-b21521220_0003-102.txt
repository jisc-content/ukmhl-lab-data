OF THE SKELETON. 6o Part I. one on each fide, a little above the ear, of a femicircular figure, formed by the overlapping (like.one fcalc upon an- other) of the upper part of the temporal bones on the lower part of the parietal, where,, in both bones, there are a great many fmall rifings and furrows, which are indent- ed into each other; though thefe inequalities do not ap- pear till the bones are feparated. In fome fkulls, indeed, the indentations here are as confpicuous externally as in other futures (z) ; ^nd what is commonly called the pofte- rior part of this fquamous future, always has the evident fertated form ; and therefore is reckoned by fome {o) a d‘i(lin£l, future, under the name of addi/ametitum pojierius future fquaniofa —I have feen two fquamous futures on the fame templ^, with a femicircular piece pf bone between them {b}. We ought here to remark, tliat the true fquamous fort of future is not confined to the conjundiion of the tempo- ral and parietal bones, but is made ufe of to join all the edges of the bones on which each temporal mufclc is pla- ced {c) •. For the two parts of the fphenoidal future which ' are continued from the anterior end of the common fqua- mous future juft now deferibed, of which one runs per- pendicularly downwards, and the other horizontally for- wards, aird -alfo the lower part of the coronal future alrea- dy taken notice of; may, all be. juftly faid to pertain tp the fquamous future. The manner how, I imagine, this fort of future is formed at thefe places is, that, by the ac- tion of the ftrong temporal mufcles on one fide, and by tlie preffure of. the, braj.u on the other, the bones are made ‘■o Cz) Coli>iiib. de rc anat. lib.

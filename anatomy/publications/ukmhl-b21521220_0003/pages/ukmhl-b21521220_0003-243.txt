Chap.II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. lol \ humeri, which plays in it as a ball in a focket, as will be more fully explained hereafter. The ufe of the fcapula is, to ferve as a fulcrum to the arm ; and, by altering its pofition on different occafions, to allow always the head of the os humeri a right-fituated, focket to move in : and thereby to affift and to enlarge greatly the motions of the fuperior extremity, and to afford the mufcles which rife from it more advantageous a£l:ions, by altering their dire£lion to the bone which they are to move. This bone alfo ferves to defend the back part of the thorax, and is often employed to fuftain weights, or to refill forces, too great for the arm to bear. The bafe, acromion, coracoid procefs, and head of the fcapula, are all in a cartilaginous ftate at birth ; and the three firft are joined as epiphyfes ; while the head, with the glenoid cavity, is not formed into a difl;in£l feparate bone, but is gradually produced by the oflification of the body of this bone being continued forwards. , t ! § 2. The Arm. The Arm has only one bone, belt known by the Latin name of os humeri {h) j which is long, round, and nearly ftraight. The upper end of this bone (r) is formed in a large round fmooth head, whofe middle point is not in a ftraight line with the axis of the bone, but Hands obliquely back- wards from it. The extent of the head is diftinguiftied by a circular foffa furrounding its bafe, where the head is United to the bone, and the capfular ligament of the joint is fixed. Below the fore-part of its bafe, two tubercles ftand out: The fmalkft one, which is fituated moft to the Vol. I.

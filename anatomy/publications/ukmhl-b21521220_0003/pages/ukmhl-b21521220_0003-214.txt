172 OF THE SKELETON. ^ Parti, % to join file os pubis, is rough and prominent at its edge, where the two lower heads of the triceps or quadriceps adduftor femorls take their rife. The upper and back-part of the os ifchium Is broad and , thick; but its lower and fore-part is narrower and thin- fubftance is of the flru£lure common to broad bones. The os ilium and pubis of the fame fide are the only bones ■which are contiguous to the os ifchium. The part of the os ifchium, -wLich forms the acetabulum, the fpinous procefs, the great tuber, and the recun'ed leg, are^all cartilaginous at birth.—The tuber, with part of the leg or procefs above it, becomes an epiphyfe before this bone is fully formed. ^ The Os Pubis (a), fiare-boncy is the lead of the three parts of the os irmoininatum, and is placed at the upper fore-part of it. The thick largeft part of this bone is employed in forming the acetabulum; from w'hich be- coming much fmallcr, it is flretched inwards to its fellow of the other fide, where it again grows larger, and fends a fmall branch dowmvards to join the end of the fmall leg of ' the os ifchium. The upper fore-part of each os pubis is tuberous and rough where the mufculus re£lus and py- ramidalis are inferted. From this a ridge is extended.along the upper edge of the bone, in a continued line with fuch another of the os ilium, which divides the abdomen and pelvis. The ligament of Fallopius is fixed to the internal end of this ridge, and the fmooth hollo\v below it is made by the pfoas and iliacus internus mufcles palTing with the anterior crural vcffels and nerves behind the ligament.— Some way below the former ridge, another is extended from the tuberous part of the os pubis dowmwards and outwards («) Pcilinis, pepis, ppcllbundum, fenellratum.

The external fide is formed into a fcmilunated fmooth cavity, lined with a cartilage, for receiving the 16wer end of the ulna. The loweft part. of the radius is formed into an oblong cavity ; in the middle of which is a fmal' tranfverfe rifing, gently hollow- ed, for lodging mucilaginous glands ; while the rifing it- f.lf is infinuated into the conjunftion of the two bones of the wrifi; that are received into the cavity.—The internal fide of this articulation is fenced by a remarkable proccfs («) of the radius, from which a ligament going out to the wrill, as the flyloid proccfs of the ulna with its ligana.ent, guard it on the outfide. The ends of both the bones of the fore-arm being thick- er than the middle, there is a confiderable diflance between the bodies of thcfe bones ; in the larger part of which a flrong tendinous, but thin ligament, is extended, to give a large enough furface for the origin of the numerous fibres of the mufcles fituated here, that are fo much funk ' ■» - tween the bones as to be protefted from injuries, to which they would otherwife be expofed. But this ligaonent is wanting near the upper end of the fore-arm, where the fupinator radii brevis, and flexor digltorum profundus, are immediately connefled (x). Both ends of the bones of the fore-arm are firfl; cartilages, and then epiphyfes, in children. As the head of the radius receives the tubercle of the os humeri, it is not only bended and extended along with the ulna, but may bp moved round its axis in any pofition ; and, that this motion round its axis may be fufliclently large, the ligament of the articulation is extended, further down than ordinary, on the neck of this bone, before it is connefled to it; and it is very thin at its upper and lower D d 2 part, (u) Malleolus internus, proceflus (lyloidcs.

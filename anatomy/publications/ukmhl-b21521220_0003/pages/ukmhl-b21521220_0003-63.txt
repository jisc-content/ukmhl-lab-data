Chap. I. 21 IN GENERAL. making foap. Hence, in acute difeafes, the marrow, as well as the other fat of^the body, is quickly walled, but mull be immediately fupplied by liquors from the vefl'els; feeing the cells within the bones, which have no afliftance to their contra£lion from the preflure of the atmofphere, cannot collapfe, as the tela cellularis under the Ikin does when the liquor in its cells is abforbed ; the bones there- fore are always full. Since it is the nature of all oil to become thin and rancid when expofed long to heat, and bones have much oil in their firm hard fubllancc, we may know why an ungrate- ful fmell and dark-coloured thin ichor proceed more from corrupted bones than from the other parts of the body ; and we can underftand the reafon of the changes of colour which bones undergo, according to their different degrees of mortification.—Hence likewife we may learn the caufe ^of a fpina ventofa, and of the difficulty of curing all ca- ries of bones proceedjng from an obftru£lion and confe- quent putrefaftion of the marrow •, and of the quick pulfe, thirfl, and heflic paroxyfms, fo often attending thefe dif- eafes. Thefe phenomena alfo teach us the reafon of the fatal prognofis taken from black fetid urine in fevers. Though bones fo far agree in their ftrifdlure and annexed parts, yet we may obferve a confiderable difference among them in their magnitude, figure, fituation, fubftance, connec- tion, ufes, &c. From which authors have taken occafion to dillinguifh them into as many clalfes us they could enumerate of thefe different circumflances. But thefe being obyious to every perfon that looks on bones, I fhall only mention one of them ; which comprehends very near the whole bones of the body, and at the fame time leads as to examine the mofl con- fiderable variety that is to be found in the difpofition of their conftituent parts, and in their ufes. It is this, that fome bones are bnadzx\A Jlaty while others are long and round. 3 ' THE

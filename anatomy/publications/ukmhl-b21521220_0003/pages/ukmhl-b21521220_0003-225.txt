Chap.ir. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 183 The five inferior ribs of each fide arc the falfe or ba- Jiard («), whofe cartilages do not reach to the fternum ; and therefore, wanting the refiftance at their fore-part, they are there pointed; and on this account, having lefs preflure, their fubftance is fofter The cartilages of tliefe falfe ribs are fiiorter as the ribs defcend.—To all thefe five ribs the circular edge of the diaphragm is connedled : and its fibres, inftead of being ftretched immediately tranf- verfely, and fo running perpendicular to the ribs, are pref- fed fo as to be often, efpecially in exfpiration, parallel to the plane in which the ribs lie: Nay, one may judge by the attachments which thefe fibres have fo frequently to the fides of the thorax a confiderable way above where their extremities are inferted into the ribs, and by the fituation of the vifcera always to be obferved in a dead fubjedl laid fupine, that there is conftantly a large concavity formed on each fide by the diaphragm within thefe baftard ribs, in which the ftomach, liver, fpleen, &c. are contained 5 which being only reckoned among the vifcera naturalia, have o'cca- fioned the name of bajiard cujlodes to thefe bones. Hence, in fimple fradlures of the falfe ribs, without fe- ver, the ftomach ought to be kept moderately filled with food, left the pendulous ribs falling inwards, fliould there- by increafe the pain, cough, &c. (x).—^—Hence likewife we may learn how to judge better of the feat of feveral difeafes, and to do the operation of the empyema, and fome others, with more fafety than we can do if we follow the common diredlions. The eight upper ribs were formerly (y) clalTed into pairs, with particular names to each two *, to wit, the crooied, tlie /aid, (u) Mctx3-axa/, y^ovSfot^oc, ax«v3-o«, x7fKf, foyi, Adultrinar, rptinx, ille- gitinix.

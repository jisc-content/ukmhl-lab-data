Part I. OF THE SKELETON. 198 the infra-fplnatus mufcle is placed, is convex, except a fofla that runs at the fide of the inferior cofta. The internal or anterior furface of this bone is hollow, except in the part above the fpine, which is convex. The fubfcapularis mufcle is extended over this furface, where it forms feveral ridges and intermediate depreffions, commonly n-ii(laken for prints of the ribs ; they point out the interllices of the bundles of fibres of which the fubfcapularis mufcle is compofed (,v). The fpine (y) rlfes fmall at tlie bafe of the fcapula, and becomes higher and broader as it advances forwards.—— — On the fides it is unequally hollowed and crooked, by the aclions of the adjacent mufcles. Its ridge (z)is divided into two rough flat furfaces : Into the upper one, the tra- pezius, mufcle is inferted ; and the lower one has part of the deltoid fixed to it. The end of the fpine, called a~ cromlcn (a), or top of the fhoulder, is broad and flat, and is fometimes only joined to the fpine by a cartilage [b).—— The anterior edge of the acromion is flat, fmooth, and co- vered with a cartilage, for its articulation with the external end of the clavicle ; and it is hollowed below, to allow a paflTage to the infra and fupra fpinati mufcles, and free mo- tion to the os humeri. The coracoid (c) procefs is crooked, with its point incli- ning forwards; fo that a hollow is left at the lower fide of its root, for the pafl'age of the infra fcapularis mufcle. —The end of this procefs is marked with three plain furfaces. Into the internal, the ferratus minor anticus is inferted: I (x) Winflow, in Memoires de I’acad. dcs fciences, 1722. ^xccTwv, Einincntia fcapularum. (z) Ptergium, crifta.

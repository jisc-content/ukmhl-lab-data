The bones of the upper jaw are joined to the bones of the fkull by the fchindylefts and futures already defcribed as comnionto the cranium and face, and they are conne£led to td.ch.otXxtvh'j gomphofts and fifteen futures. The gcmphofis is only where the teeth are fixed in their fockets, and the fchhid^lc^n is only where the edges of the vomer are joined to other bones. The futures are generally diltinguifhed by numbers, which Iiave been differently applied ; and therefore I join thofe (o) who prefer the giving names to each, which may be eafily contrived from their fituation, or from the bones which'they connect. The firfl; is the anterior nafal (p), which is ffraight, and placed longitudinally in the middle fore-part of the nofe. The fecond and third are the lateral nafal {q), which are at each fide of the nofe, and almofl parallel to the firfl; future. Each of the tvi^o lacrymal Is almofl; femicircular, and is placed round the lacrymal groove. The fixth and feventh are the internal orbltar : each of which is extended obliquely from the middle of the lower fide of an orbit to the edge of its bafe. The two external orbltars are continued, each from the end of the internal orbitar to the under and fore-part of the cheek. The tenth is the myftachial, which reaches only from the (o) Vander J^inden. Mcdicin. phyfiolog. cap. 13. art. a. § 10.—Rolfinc. Anat. lib. a. cap. 25.—Schenk. Schol. part. feft. ult. par. a. cap. J.

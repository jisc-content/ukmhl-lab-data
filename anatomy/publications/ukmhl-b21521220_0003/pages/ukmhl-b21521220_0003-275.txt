The middle of each of thefe cartilages is broad, and the ends of them turn narrower and thinner as they approach the middle protuberance of the tibia. The thick convex edge of each cartilage is conne£ted to the capfular and other ligaments of the articulation : but fo near to their rife from the tibia, that the cartilages are not allowed to change place far ; while the narrow ends of the cartilages becoming almofl; ligaments, are fixed at the infertion of the ftrong crdfs ligament into the tibia, and feem to have their fubftance united with it •, therefore a circular hole is left between each cartilage and the ligament, in which the mod prominent convex part of each condyle of the thigh-bone moves. The circumference of thefe cavities is rough and unequal, for the firm* connexion of the liga- ments of the joint. Immediately below the edge at its back-part, two rough flatted protuberances ftand out; in- to the internal, the tendon of the femimembranofus muf- de is inferred ; and a part of the crofs ligament is fixed to the externali On the outfide of this lafl tubercle, a finooth flightly-hollowed fiirface is formed by the adfion of the poplitceus mufcle. / Below the fore-part of the upper end of the tibia, a con- fiderable rough protuberance (g) rifes, to which the ftro;ig tendinous ligament of the rotula is fixed. On the internal fide of this, there is a broad fcabrous flightly-hol- lowed furface, ' to .which the internal long ligament of the joint, the aponeurofis of the vaftus internus, and the ten- dons of the feminervofus, gracilis, and fartorius, are fix- ed. The Icweft part of this furface is therefore the place where the tibia oUght to' be fawn through in an amputa- tion, fo as not to have too long and troublefome a flump, VoL.

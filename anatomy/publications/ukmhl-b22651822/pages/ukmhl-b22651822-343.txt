323 CHAPTER XIV THE SPOROZOA : I. THE GREGARINES AND COCCIDIA Under the common denomination Sporozoa are grouped together a great number of parasitic organisms extremely varied in form, structure, habitat, and life-history, but of which the most general though not invariable characteristic is that the propagation of the parasite from one host to another is effected by means of spores, in the primary sense of the word (see p. 165, footnote)—that is to say, resistant seed-like bodies within Avhich one or more parasitic germs are protected by a firm envelope or capsule, whereby they are enabled to resist the vicissitudes of the outer world until they pass, in one way or another, into the body of a suitable host; when this end is attained, the spore germinates—that is to say, the contained organisms are set free and a fresh infection is started. It is very obvious that propagation by means of resistant spores is a character very inadequate for diagnosing an extensive group of Protozoa. In the first place, many organisms, parasitic or free-hvmg, which are not included in the class Sporozoa, are propagated by means of resistant spores. In the second place, many forms included in the Sporozoa do not produce resistant spores^ being propagated by methods which render any such phase un- necessary. The class therefore ceases to be amenable to strict verbal definitions, and it is not surprismg that the limits assigned to it have varied at different times, and are even now debated. The class Sporozoa was origmally founded by Leuckart to comprise two closely allied orders—the Gregarines and the Coccidia. To this nucleus other groups were added, in particular the various forms termed vaguely " psorosperms "* — a word corned originaUy by Johannes MiiUer to denote the spores of the Myxosporidia, but soon extended to other parasitic organisms. Ihus 'Sporozoa" and " psorosperms " became practically synonymous terms, and the class to which these names were applied became a most heterogeneous assemblage of organisms * From the Greek xj^d^pa, mange, and o-Tr^p^a, a seed, on acponnf nf

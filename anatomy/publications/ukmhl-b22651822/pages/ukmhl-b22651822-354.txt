The small clear cells produced stud the opaque body of the sporont like pearls ; hence this stage is often spoken of as the " pearl-stage " {perlage, etc.). The remainder of the body of the sporont is left over as residua] protoplasm, which may contain nuclei, but which takes no further direct share in the development. The cells that are produced are known as the " prunary EiG. 147.â€”Stages of nuclear division in the cyst of Pterocephalus [Nina] gracilis.

The amount of transforma- tion which a gametid midergoes in becoming a gamete may be very considerable, or it may be practically nil. In some cases the male gamete develops a special structure, while the female remains

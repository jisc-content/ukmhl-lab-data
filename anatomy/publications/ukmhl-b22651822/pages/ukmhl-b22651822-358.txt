THE PROTOZOA 338 reproduce their like for many generations, but which finally produce mcro- zoites which grow up into paucinucleate sghizonts, and these produce mero- zoites which grow up into sporonts. The sporogony of this genus is also peculiar. Two sporonts associate, and the nucleus of each sporont divides into three ; the body of each sporont then divides into a smaller cell with one nucleus and a larger cell^with two nuclei; the small cell is a gamete, which is Fig. 149.â€”General diagram of the life-cycle of Schizocystis gregarionides, after Leger (617, ii.). A, Sporozoite escaping from the spore ; B, C, D, E, growth of the sporozoite into the multinucleate schizont, of which there are two types: the vermiform schizont {a), which attaches itself to the epithelium by its anterior end, and the massive schizont (6), which lies free in the gut of the host; F, division of the schizont into a number of merozoites, which may either grow into schizonts again {0^, 0^), or may grow into sporonts (G^); H young sporonts ; /, association of two full-grown sporonts; J, formation of a common cyst by two associated sporonts ; K, division of the nuclei in the sporonts ; L, formation of the gametes by the sporonts ; M, copulation of the gametes ; N, each zygote becomes a sporoblast and forms a spore. enveloped by the larger binucleate cell. The two gametes copulate, and the zygote becomes a single spore with the usual eight sporczoites; the two binucleate envelope-ceUs form a protective envelope to the spore dunng its development, and die off when it is ripe (Leger, 617, i.).

THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 205 R—s (b) Phototaxis and Effects of Light and Other Rays.—Many Pro- tozoa appear quite indifferent to light—at least of ordinary intensity; others show a very decided reaction, as ah'eady mentioned, either negative or positive. Thus many amoebae, Pelomyxa, etc., are negatively phototactic, and pass at once into a condition of rest and inactivity when exposed to light. According to Mast (176), a sudden increase in the intensity of the illumination inhibits move- ment in Amoeba proteus; but if the illumination remains constant, movement begins again in a few moments. If the illumination is very gradually in- creased, it produces no response. In strong hght Amoeba proteus orientates itself, producing pseudopodia only on the less illuminated side. Many flagellates, on the other hand, especially the holophj^tic forms such as Dinoflagellates, Phytomastigina, Eugle- noids, etc., show the opposite reaction, moving towards the hght or becoming active when exposed to it, and passing into a resting state in the dark. The A positive phototaxis of the holophytic JFig. 84.—^, Anterior Protozoa has an obvious bionomical sig- nificance, since the holophytic nutrition can only proceed in the presence of hght. In the majority of holophytic flageUates the phototactic reaction is associated with the possession of a special organ, the stigma or eye-spot." The stigma of Euglena consists oi a protoplasmic ground-substance forming a hue network, m which is embedded pigment m the form of drop-like bodies. The picrment granules are brightly refractUe, with a dfstmct outhne, and form a single layer. In some cases the granules are spherical and all of the same size; m others they are more irregular in form and of different mVp« TKo pigment appears to be a derivative of chlorophvU The ,H^^n contact with a well-marked thiVkpniL ^ i stigma is m close reaction of ^'^^ZeT^a to Lht S^^^^^ f^T' ^^^^ this way the light, but away from st?on?sunuX^ n .^""f'"^^'"^^^ ^owa^^s ^ moderate onflageUa^s'"^^^^^^^^^ spectrum exJrt the strongest stimulus ncarly^sefficient a whlL lil^^^ (P^) found the blue rays end of Flagel- Eiiglena viridis. f,., lum ; ces., CBSophagus ; °bl., thickening (blepharoijlast ?) on one of the two roots of the flagellum ; sL, stigma ; rh, the two roots of the flagellum passing through the reservoir {R)Qi the contractile vacuoles, two to be attached to its opposite side.

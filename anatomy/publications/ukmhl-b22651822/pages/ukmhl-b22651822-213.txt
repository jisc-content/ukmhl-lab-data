THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 195 vacuoles near, and under the influence of, the nucleus. In the coccidian partisite Caryotro'pha (p. 352), the nucleus of the parasite is connected by a Idnd of protoplasmic canal with the nucleus of the host-cell (Siedlecki, 653). In the astomatous Ciliata (p. 451) a diffuse nucleus is very commonly found, probably in relation to absorption of nutriment by the osmotic method. The process of nutrition in Protozoa may lead in some cases, not to growth of the protoplasmic body dh-ectly, but to the produc- tion and storage of reserve food-substances, which are precipitated ia the cytoplasm, and are utihzed at a later period for rapid growth dm-ing reproductive phases. The reserve-materials deposited in this way vary considerably in nature in different cases. Examples are the paramylum-grains of many flagellates; the paraglycogen- grains of gregarmes and cihates, similar in nature to glycogen, but with certain distinctive reactions ; the plastinoid granules of coccidia (p. 346) ; and other similar substances. In Radiolaria oil- globules and albumen - spheres occur. An important substance, acting apparently as reserve-material for the growth of the nucleus is volutin (p. 68). ' The effects of starvation on Protozoa have been studied by a number of investigators, most recently by Lipska (173), who gives a complete bibliog- raphy and resume of previous work on the subject. Lipska found that P^rameomm died after hye to seven days, a much shorter period than allowed by WaUengren (214) and others, indicating that Lipska's methods were more drastic and sources of food were more thoroughly excluded in her exjerimrt? fJ ^^y^ f ^T""'^ ° starvation the reserves ^ the endoplasm are^useTup Snu es mZ^^:1'' :T1 *^,f t^^^ «"^aUer endoplasm^ granules.

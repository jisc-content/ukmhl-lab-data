'^^ THE PROTOZOA or grain in the cell cannot be definitely identified as chromatin in an cases by .ny chemical or physical test, but only by its relation to the bfe anc development of the organism as a whole, and more especially to the function of reproduction and the phe'nomena o sex, as will be shown more fully by means of concrete instances in ubsequezit chapters. The sum of modern loaowledge with regard to the vital activities of living bodies and the life-liistories of organisms, whether plants or animals, Protozoa or Metazoa indicates that the chromatm exercises a regulative and determina- tive influence over the functions and properties of the cell-body Direct experimental proof of the all-importance of the nucleus for the life of the cell is obtained by cuttmg Protozoa mto pieces some contammg portions of the nucleus, others consisting of cytoplasm alone (p. 210, infra). Those pieces that contain nuclear substance are able to regenerate the lost parts of the body and to perform all the functions of life, and in particular those of assimilation, growth, and reproduction ; those, on the contrary, that contain no portion of the nucleus rapidly lose the power of assimilation, and are unable to regenerate the body, to grow or to reproduce; and though they remain for a time irritable and capable of movement, they soon lose these properties. There are a number of facts which Indicate that in the physiological activities of the cell the chief function of the nucleus is the formation of ferments ; it is therefore all-important in regulating the assimilative processes of the living substance (p. 194). The conception of chromatin as the directive and regulative centre of the cell-body renders intelligible a number of phenomena con- nected with it, such as the elaborate mechanisms which, as will be described in the next chapter, are gradually evolved and perfected for the exact partition of the chromatin in the reproduction of the cell by division, and the relation of chromatin to the sexual process. Further, the extremely variable nature of the chromatin-substance becomes at once intelligible on this view of its relation to the specific characters and properties of the organism; for since every species of living being—perhaps, even, every m- dividual of the same species—difEers to a greater or less extent from every other : then, if such differences are determined by the chromatin, it follows that the chromatin must also differ to a corresponding degree in each case, and that consequently uni- formity of character in different samples of chromatin cannot be expected to occur. Hertwig (67, 92) considers that a certain quantitative relation of nucleus and cytoplasm is necessary in any cell for the normal continuance of the vital functions. This nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio (" Kernplasma-Relation") is subject to variations at different

THE PROTOZOA 82 the kinetic activities of the nucleus, a function wliich may be re- garded as its primary and most characteristic role. It may act also, however, as the centre of other kinetic functions of the cell- body, especially in relation to motile organs such as flagella ; it then appears as the so-called " basal granule," from which the flagella take origin. The basal granule appears as a thickening at the base of the flagellum. It may be continued farther into the cytoplasm, or connected with the nucleus, by means of one or more root-like processes known as the rhizoplast. A centrosome which is in relation to a motor cell-organ is termed generally a blepharoplast. The rhizoplast may have various origins ; in some cases it represents the centrodesmose (p. 103) which connects the bleph- aroplast with the nuclear centro- some, or the remains of such a comiection ; in other cases it repre- sents the remains of the nuclear spindle of the previous nuclear division, as in the swarm-spores of Stemonilis flaccida (Jahn, 69) and ABC Fig. SS.—MasUgina setosa. after Gold- Fig. 39.—Connection of the flagellum Schmidt (41). n., Nucleus from which and the nucleus m Mashgma setosa. the long flagellum arises; the body A and 5 As seen m the living is full of diatoms and other food- state ; 0 after fixation and staining, bodies.

The relation of the nuclear to the kinetic apparatus is best studied in the Flagellata, where three principal conditions may be distinguished as follows : , • r ^--^^o 1 The cell-body contains but a single centrosome, which functions also as a blepharoplast ; these two names, then, denote two different phases of activity of one and the same body, which is a centro-

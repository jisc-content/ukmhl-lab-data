With further gro^vtli more chambers are formed givmg rise to a complex " polythalamous " shell composed of many chambers all occupied by the protoplasmic body (p. 232, infra). For a detailed study of the developmental mechanics of shell-formation, see Knumbler (35). 2. Internal Skeletal Structures.â€”In many cases in which the proto- plasmic body is naked at the surface, or bears only an extremely tliin cuticle, a definite body-form may be maintained by means of internal supporting fibrils or other similar structm^es (Koltzoff, 30, 31). In some cases such structures may be of temporary nature. A beautiful example of this is seen in the dehcate organic axes formed in the pseudopodia of Heliozoa (Fig. 22), in the form of slender needle-like rods secreted by the protoplasm to stiffen the pseudopodia, and absorbed agam when the pseudopodia are re- tracted. In other cases, supporting structures of orgaiuc natme may be permanent constituents of the protoplasmic body ; such are the axial rods, or " axostyles," found in many flagellates, such as Trichomonas (Fig. 6, ax.), Lophomonas (Fig. 45), etc., slender flexible rods of organic substance which form a supporting axis for the body. Previous to division the axostyle is absorbed, and new axostyles are formed in the daughter-mdividuals. The axostyles are stated to arise from a centrodesmose (p. 103, injra) formed in the process of division of the blepharoplast (Dobell, 236) or of the centriole of the nucleus (Hartmann and Chagas, 62) ; the centrodesmose per- sists after division is complete, and its two halves become the axostyles of the two daughter-individuals. In Trichomonas eberthi, however, Martin and Robertson (348) find that the axostyles arise after division quite independently of the centrodesmoses or other nuclear structures. In Octomitus (Fig. 116) two axostyles are present. From supporting structures of organic nature, such as the axostyles or the organic axes of the pseudopodia mentioned above, it is not difficult to derive the more rigid and permanent elements Imown as " spicules," in which the organic basis becomes uidurated by deposits of inorganic mineral substance. In some cases spicules may perhaps consist entirely of muieral substance deposited directly within the living substance without any organic basis. In

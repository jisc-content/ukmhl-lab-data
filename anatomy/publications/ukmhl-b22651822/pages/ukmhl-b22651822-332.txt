No other investigators have fouSd sexual processes of any kind in trypanoplasms. III. The Genus Crithidia. The distinctive structural feature of Crithidia (Fig. 135, A) is the relatively short undulating membrane which, with the single flagellum, arises in the middle of the body from the vicinity of a kinetonucleus situated beside, or in front of, the trophonucleus. The form of the body varies from a relatively long, slender type to the short, " barley-grain " form from which the name of the genus is derived. As alreadv pointed out, the application of the name Griihidia, as the denomination of a genus is involved in considerable confusion and perplexity—partly because the distinctive morphological characters shade ofE by imper- ceptible gradations into those of trypanosomes on the one hand, and leptomonads on the other, but still more because a certain number of the " species of Crithidia " are unquestionably de- velopmental stages either of tryjianosomes or leptomonads, and others are justly suspected of being so. In the present state of know- ledge, it is safest to presume that any " Crithidia" from the digestive tract of a blood-sucking insect is a stage of a trypano- some from the blood of a vertebrate, tmtil the contrary has been clearly established. At the same time the possibility must always be taken into accomit that a blood-sucking invertebrate may harbour flagellate parasites peculiar to itself in addition to those bl.

Such cases, while they minimize the gap between Ciliata and other Protozoa, do not bring the ciliates nearer to any particular class, since a similar type of syngamy and of preparations for it may occur either in Sarcodma or Mastigophora. As the most distmctive feature of the Ciliata there remains that wliich is implied in the name— that is to say, tho posses- sion of cilia. As has been pointed out above, how- ever, a cilium is similar to a flagellum in every essential point of structure and function. There can be no doubt that the ciliary covering represents a large number of flagella specialized in respect to size, number, arrange- ment, and co-ordination. It has been mentioned abov3 that some flagel- lates, such as the Triclio- nympJiida and allied forms, are regarded by some authorities as transi- tional from the FJagellata to the Ciliata. It is per- haps improbable, how- ever, that the transition from the one group to the other should have been through endoparasitic forms ; and it is on the whole more likely that free- living forms, such as the holoniastigote genus MuUicilia, arc the nearest representatives of the earlier ancestral forms of the Ciliata. Two interesting forms have been described which combine in some respects the characters of both Flagollata and Ciliata. Maupasia paradoxa (Fig. 189, B) is described by its discoverer, Schewiakoff (863), as having the body metabolic, with cilia in the anterior part of the bodyi and tho remainder covered with long flagella. At the hinder end of the body is a longer flagellum implanted close beside the aperture of the efl'ercnt duct of the contractile vacuole.

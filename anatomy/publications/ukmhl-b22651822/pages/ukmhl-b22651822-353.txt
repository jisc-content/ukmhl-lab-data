333 THE GREGARINES AND COCCIDIA The generative chromatin may organize itself into a definite secondary nucleus (" micronuclous ") during the break-up of the sporont-nucleus, as in Ptero- cepJuilus (Fig. 145); or the fu-st spmdle arises withm the sporont-nucleus before it breaks up, as in 0. ovala (Fig. 146); or a number of distinct chromo- somes are formed in the sporont-nucleus durmg the process of its disintegration, which pass to the exterior of the nucleus and form the equatorial pla,te of a spmdle of which the achromatiuic elements appear to arise chiefly outside the nucleus, as in Monocijstis rostrata. In either case the first spindle consists only of the generative chi'omatm ; the remainder of the original sporont-nucleus is disintegrated and absorbed, or is left over in the residual protoplasm of the cyst. The statement of Kuschakewitsch, to the effect that the primary nucleus of the sporont may break up into a mass of clu:omidia, from which a number of secondary (generative) nuclei are re-formed, has not received confirmation in any quarter. The mitoses in the sporont are remarkable, in most cases, for the very distinct centrosomes (Fig. 147), which appear at the side of the nucleus before B Fig. 146.-TWO stages in the formation of the first division-spindle of Greqarina ovata. showing its ongm irom a very small part of the primary nucleuf In A the spindle is seen within the primary nucleus ; in B the spindle is becoming free from it at one point, after which the remainder of the primai-v nudeu! degenerates.

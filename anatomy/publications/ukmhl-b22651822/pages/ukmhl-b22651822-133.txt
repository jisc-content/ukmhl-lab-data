THE REPRODUCTION OF THE PROTOZOA 115 the mechanism of division, is furnished by some examples of the Heliozoa, and especially by the nuclear divisions of Actinosphcerium, which have been the subject of extraordinarily thorough investiga- tion by Hertwig (64). In this form there are three difierent modes of karyokmesis, which, however, for present purposes may be classified under two heads : karyokinesis without and with centro- somes. In the ordinary nuclear division during the vegetative life of the organism, and also ui the divisions by which the primary -r G Fig, &2.—Achnos'phcerium eichhorni :_sta,ges of the ordinary, vegetative nuclear division, without centrosomes, ^^of free-living individuals (not encysted) A ii, i^ormation of the chromosomes within the nucleus, and of the "proto- plasmic polar cones outside the nucleus ; G, spindle-stage with polar cones {p.c), polar plates (r.p.), and equatorial plate of chromosomes (e.r)- V, stage with daughter-plates of chromosomes which have travelled towards the polar plates ; E~G, division of the nucleus, reconstitution of tne daughter-nuclei, and disappearance of the polar cones. After Hertwig (64). cysts divide into the secondary cysts (p. 138), centrosomes are absent, but they are present in the two divisions which produce the two reduction - nuclei thrown o£E from each seoondarv cyst. In the ordinary karyokinesis of Actinosphcerium (Pig 62) an equatorial plate is formed composed of a large number of small, rod-hke chromosomes, imperfectly separated from one another which divide transversely. The spindle arises from the achromatinic framework of the nucleus, and terminates in two conspicuous polar

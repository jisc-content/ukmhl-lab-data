Fig. 125.â€”Trypanosoma viega, from the blood of African frogs, fl.^. Marginal flagellum of the undulating membrane; fl?, free flagellum; m., myoneme-striations (it is doubtful whether the granular streaks or the clear interspaces correspond exactly to the actual myonemes); n, kinetonucleus; N, space in which the trophonucleus lies, but, not being stained, it is not clearly defined in the preparation. After Minchin, magni- fied 2,000; compare Pigs. 11 and 12 at the same magnification.

DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF THE PROTOZOA 9 method of subdividing them is purely arbitrary and artificial; it leads to the result that many forms are claimed by both sides, and are always to be found described in both botanical and zoological treatises. It is nevertheless convenient for many reasons to retain the group Protozoa, even though Ave are obliged to include in it some forms which are plants in every sense of the word. The systematist who deskes to give a rigidly logical definition of the Protozoa is, then, confronted with a dilemma : either to exclude from it forms with plant-like metab- olism which naturally belong to it, or, by admitting such forms, to impaii- the universal applicability of the definition given. Such difficulties arise in every attempt to apply rigid verbal definitions to natural groups of livmg things ; they are the direct outcome of the fact that all organisms have undergone and are undergoing a process of evolution, whereby they adapt themselves to new conditions of life and acquire new characters, as a result of which any two forms now distinct are or have been, connected by intermediate forms. ii N B Fici.

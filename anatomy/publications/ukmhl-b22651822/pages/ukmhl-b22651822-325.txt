THE H^MOFLAGELLATES AND ALLIED FORMS 30S parasite, keeping up the infection of the invertebrate host. In hunger-periods the flagellates may persist as simple, rounded, Leishmatiia-likQ forms. Sooner or later many, it may be the greater number, but not all, of the crithidial forms become modified into the trypaniform individuals, which represent (3) the propagative phase of the parasite, and pass forwards to be inoculated into the verte- brate host. Those crithidial forms which do not become trans- formed into the propagative individuals remain to multiply and replenish the stock. A very much debated question in this development is that relating to the occurrence of sexual phases and syngamy, which, j)urely on the analogy of the malarial parasites, are assumed almost universally to occur in the invertebrate host. Not in a single instance as yet, however, has the sexual act been proved satisfactorily to take place in the development of trypano- somes. The fertihzation described by Schaudinn (132) in " T. noctuce " is the well-known conjugation of Halteridium, which can be observed without difiSculty; and though Schaudinn described so-called " male " and " female " types of trypanosomes in the mosquito, he expressly stated that they did not and could not conjugate. The process of syngamy described by Prowazek (497) for T. lewisi in the rat-louse, though " confirmed " by Baldrey (396), Gonder (445-5), and Rodenwaldt, is almost certainly the agglomeration of degenerating forms (Swellengrebel, 516 ; compare Reichenow, 78, p. 268). Less biassed investigators, who have studied the developmental cycle of trypanosomes with great care, such as Chagas, Robertson, and others, have been quite unable to observe sexual processes of any kind. The habihty to error in the mterpretation of observations is greatly increased, first by the fact that trypanosomes divide longitudinally and often unequaUy, secondly by the phenomena of agglomeration (p. 128), which occur readily under un- lavourable conditions. Consequently the adhesion together of two trypano- somes may be due to quite other causes than sexual affinity. In some cases tbe aUeged occurrence of syngamy has been based merely on the fact that non-llageUated forms have been seen, which, on the analogy of the malarial parasites (p. 362), are termed " ookinetes " and interpreted as zygotes It IS certainly remarkable, m view of the paucity of data, that so many investigators, foUowing Schaudmn's lead, should persist in ascribing all form- aitterentiation m trypanosomes to sex, and should be miable, apparently, to conceive of any other cause of polymorphism in parasites which have to adapt tbemselves, in the course of theh life-cycle, to a great diversity of conditions (compare also Doflein, 430). It must be emphasized that the only true criterion of sexual polymorphism is sexual behaviour, and until that has been established it is premature to speak of sexual differentiation. borne investigators have upheld the mifashionable view that the syngamv of toypanosomes occurs m the vertebrate host; so Bradford and PhmnTer, and ?^LS.^ Ottolenghi, who has described in T. hruaii, T. eguinum, TwnT ' ^""^ T'P"''^'''^' foUowing process of sexual conjugation ?o onfSer hv f^""^"?'

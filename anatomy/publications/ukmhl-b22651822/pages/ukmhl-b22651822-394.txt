In other cases of similar transmission, such as that of trypanosomes, yellow fever, etc., it is known that the inverte- brate host once rendered infective, remains so for a very long time, probably lor the rest of its life. In the case of malarial parasites this point remains to be tested experimentally. The hffimamoebse of Primates have been studied by a number of investigators, and several species distmguished : Plasmodium kochi (Laveran) from the chim- panzee and various African monkeys ; P. pitheci from the orang-outang, and ^(^cacus spp. (Halberstaedter and Prowazek, Mathis and Leger, 4/J) ; P. cynomolgi from Macacus cynomolgus (Mayer, A.P K , xii p 314) • and P hrasilianum from the ouakari, Brachyurus calvus (Berenberg-Gossler)! Ihe schizogony appears to be generally similar to that of the species parasitic in man ; ring-stages occur, and the multiplication is in some cases similar to the tertian, m other cases to the quartan parasite. Binucleate trophozoites are of common occurrence, and binary fission also occurs (Flu, A.P.K., xii., P; .A striking feature of monkey-malaria is the comparative rarity of multiplicative phases, which may be in relation to the fact that these parasites cause no appreciable symptoms of disease in their hosts; in both respects they are comparable to non-pathogenic trypanosomes. Transmission is probably effected by anopheline mosquitoes (Mayer). In bats two distinct forms of intracorpuscular parasites have been described under distinct generic names : Polychromophilus, from Vespertilio and Miniop- terus spp., and Achromaticus, from Vesperugo spp. These two genera are distinguished by the fact that Polychromophilus produces melanin-pigment, and Achromaticus does not. Polychromophilus is apparently an ordinary hsemamoeba which should be included in the genus Plasmodium. Achro- maticus, on the other hand, appears, from the recent investigation of Yakimoff and others (753), to be a true piroplasm (see below). Plasmodium vassali from squirrels has ring-like young trophozoites, and its schizogony takes place by binary or multiple fission, more commonly the former (Vassal) ; some forms of the parasite figured resemble Piroplasma. The life-history of the Proieosoma-parasite of birds has been studied in detail by Neumann ; the principal phases of the parasite are essentially similar to those of the hsemamcebse parasitic in man. Experimenting with canaries, Neumann transmitted the infection by means of Stegomyia fasciata, but this mosquito was found to be less efficient as a host for Proteosoma than the species of Culex- Of Stegomyia only 11-4 per cent, developed ripe cysts, as against 85 per cent, of Oulex; the development of the parasite is accomplished in nine to eleven days in Oulex, in thirteen to fifteen days in Stegomyia ; and a far smaller number of the parasites succeed in developing in Stegomyia, in which the maximum number of cysts seen in the stomach of any mosquito was thirty-six, while in Culex much larger numbers, 500 to 1,000, are recorded. But little is known of the life-cycle of the reptilian haemamoebsG of the genus HcBmacystidixim. Aragao and Neiva have described schizogony of the

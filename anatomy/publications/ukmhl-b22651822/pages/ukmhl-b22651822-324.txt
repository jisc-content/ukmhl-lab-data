In some eases this culture in the probosc s aprars to bo the sole form of developmental cycle in the fly, as for ex'mnloTn T. cazalboui (Roubaud, 506, Bouffard), T. vivax (Bruee%Ti, m ) StvS IS termed by Roubaud evolution par fixation directe. In other spedes l^-^'^^P^^on T. pecaudi) the parasite multiplies first in the digestive tract Lt^rZ/nrRn K " f^9a<\s forward into the proboscis-ewZwiton par fixation indirecte of Roubaud; m this case, however, the possibihty does not seem to be excluded that the forms seen in the digestive tract may have belon-ed to the deve opmental cycle of a distinct trypanosome. Development of this Kind has only been observed in tsetse-flies. According to Bouffard, T. cazalboui can be transmitted mechanicaUv bv t^tomoxys, but goes through its developmental cycle only in the proboscis of Mossma palpalis ; Stomoxys may therefore cause epidemics of the disease { souma ), but endemic areas are always in regions where G. palpalis occurs. The tsetse-fly is not infective until six days after first feeding on an intected animal, and it then remains infective permanently, or at least for the greater part of its existence. Hence the proboseis-cycle is a rapid develop- ment, comparable, as regards the time it requires, to that of T. lewisi in the flea rather than to that of other trypanosomes in the digestive tract of the tsetse. Finally,* mention must be made of the cysts of T. grayi, described by Minchin (476), occurring in the hind-gut of Glossina palpalis. The cysts result from the encystment of a crithidial form, and are very similar to the ej'sts of Herpetomonas, described by Prowazek (Fig. 124), from the hmd-gut of the house-fly; their mode of formation indicates that they are destined to pass out of the rectum to the exterior with the faeces, and Minchin has suggested that a contaminative method of spreading the infection may occur in addition to the usual inoculative method. The possibility must "be reckoned with, however, that the cysts in question may be part of the cycle of a distinct flagellate parasite, perhaps peculiar to the fly alone, and may not belong at all to the life-cycle of T. grayi, which has now been shown to be the developmental form of the trypanosome of the crocodile (c/. Cystotrypanosoma, Roubaud, 557-5). According to Kleine and Taute, trypanosomes, not encysted, may be found in the faeces of infected tsetses. Apart from the somewhat aberrant development of the members of the &rMcu"-group, which require further elucidation, the cycle of a trypanosome in the invertebrate host appears to consist typically of three principal phases : (1) An initial multiplicative phase, wliich may be trypaniform, as in T. lewisi, or Leishmania - like, as in T. cruzi, or may take the form of unequal division of large trypani- form individuals to produce either small crithidial forms directly, as in fish-trypanosomes in the leech Hemidepsis, or rounded Leishmania-iorms which later become crithidial, as in T. raice and T. vittaoet; to this initial phase succeeds (2) a crithidial phase, which may pass farther down the alimentary canal, and which in any case multiplies by fission and constitutes the principal stock of the * The development described by Sbhaudinn (132) for T. noctuce is dealt mth in a subsequent chajDter (p. 390).

DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF THE PROTOZOA 11 always by some form of fission—that is to say, division of the body into smaller parts ; that the phenomena known as " syngamy " and " sex " occur, perhaps universally, throughout the group ; and that it is very characteristic of Protozoa, as compared with other Protista, to exhibit in their life-history a develop- mental cycle, more or less complicated, in. the course of which the organism may appear under very different forms at different stages in its develop- ment. The Protozoa, as thus under- stood, are commonly divided into four main subdivisions, termed "classes." Other methods of classifying the Protozoa have been suggested, which will be considered later ; for the present the old- established subdivisions are sufficient for our purpose. Class I., Sabcodina.*— Protozoa in which the proto- plasmic body is naked or non- corticate — that is to say, without a hmiting envelope in the form of a cuticle, membrane, or stiff cortical layer ; consequently the body tends to be either more or less spherical in floating forms, or to have an irregular, con- tinually changing shape in c reeping forms. 0 rgans serving for locomotion and capture of food are furnished by tem- porary extensions of the Uving protoplasm, termed pseudo- podia. A skeleton or shell may be present. Examples Fig. 10.—Acineta grandis. sL, Stalk ; lli., theca ; s., suctorial tentacles. After Saville Kent.

THE GREGARINES AND COCCIDIA 347 (b) The body of the female sporont rounds itself off and bursts the host-cell. At the same time the karyosome is expelled from the nucleus (Fig. 75, p. 146; Fig. 152, G It is then ripe for fertilization as a complete and mature macrogamete. The process of gamete-formation varies considerably in its details in other coccidia, though similar in all essential points to that of C. scliuhergi. The most important difference is that in many coccidia—as, for instance, in Adelea Fig. ISi.—Adelea ovata: association of sporonts and gamete-formation. A The two sporonts associated; in the male (J) the nucleus beginning to break up mto chromidia ; 5 the nucleus of the male sporont resolved into chro- mima ; O, formation of four secondary nuclei from the chromidia ; D in the ^f„i •^'V^t ^''^®-^"'''' microgametes are formed from the four secondaiT wf' f Ijye^ipus stage ; in the female gamete the nucleus has taken the torm of a fertilization-spmdle.

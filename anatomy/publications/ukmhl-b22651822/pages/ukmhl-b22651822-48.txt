The very first beginnings of a cortical layer are seen in some species of amoebfe, such as Amoeba verrucosa—species in which the X3rotoplasni, extremely viscid and slow-flowing, forms a delicate investing XDellicle at the surface. In these cases the pellicle is so thin that it does not hinder the amoeboid movement appreciably (Fig. 23). A further advance is seen in some of the Flagellata,

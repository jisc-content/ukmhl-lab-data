THE GREGARINES AND COCCIDIA 351 The germination of the spore takes place always, apparently, in the digestive tract of the specific host, and there alone; it may be in some special part of it, as in G. cunicvli, the spores of which, according to Metzner, germinate in pancreatic, bixt not in gastric, juice. The remarkable form Selenococcidium intermedium (Fig. 155), parasitic in the intestine of the lobster, described by Leger and Duboscq (646), differs from all other known coccidia in the character of its trophozoites and its schizogony. The trophozoites are vermiform, nematode-like organisms, extremely active in their movements, and frequently coiling themselves up and wriggling like worms (Fig. 155, A—D). The anterior end of the body is blunt, the posterior pointed; the surface of the body contains myonemes running spirally, visible in the living state at the anterior end as oblique striations. The youngest trophozoites have a single nucleus, but as they grow the nuclei multiply, until in the full-grown organism there are eight. The trophozoite is now a schizont, and penetrates into an epithelial cell of the intestine in order to multiply by schizogony. The vermiform body roUs uji within the cell into a compact oval mass (Fig. 155, E), and then each of its eight nuclei grows out into a tongue-like cytoplasmic process. In this way eight merozoites are formed round a central residual mass. The merozoites are set free as the uninucleate trophozoites (Fig. 155, F, G). This " in- different " type of schizogony may continue for several generations, until a final generation appears in which the schizonts are sexually differentiated; smaller, slender trophozoites with eight nuclei give rise to eight merozoites which grow into male sporonts, and larger, stouter forms with four nuclei produce four merozoites which become female sporonts. The male sporonts (gametocytes) arise from vermicules with clear cytoplasm, which penetrate into an epithelial ceU and roll up into an ovoid mass (Fig. 155, H); they may do this when they have but a single nucleus, but usually not until the nuclei have increased to eight. In the compact, intra- cellular gametocyte the nuclei multiply rapidly in a manner similar to that described above for the schizont of Adelea, by binary or multiple fission following division of the karyosome. In later stages of multiphcation the karyosomes become very small, and the peripheral chromatin of the nuclei increases greatly, so that they have the appearance of patches of granules (Fig. 155,7). When the multiphcation is complete, each such patch of granules forms the dense, comma-shaped nucleus of a microgamete (Fig 155 J) An enormous number of microgametes arise from each gametocyte ' but the structure of the free microgametes has not been made out.

If a Tocophrya bo starved the refrmgent bodies are slowly absorbed, and the protoplasm becomes quite clear (Pihpjev). Hence the refringent bodies tliat arise from the diges- tive vacuoles represent reserve-material; there appears to be no defecation of indigestible residues. The nature and origin of the tentacles of acinetans have been much dis- cussed, and some authors have sought to derive them from cirri or cilia bchuberg (44) points out, however, that the structure of the tentacles is quite tJae opposite of that of the cilia ; in a cilium the axial portion is of firm con- sistence, the superficial layer is fluid, while in a tentacle the axis is fluid and the superficial sheath is of firm texture. Collin (877) considers that the pre- hensile tentacles are modifications or adaptations of a pseudopodium-fike process ; on the other hand, he regards the suctorial tentacles as organs of quite a different kind, more like the cytostomo of a eiliate than anything else ; they may be considered each as a cytostome which has gro\\Ti out from the body on a slender process or stalk (compare also Hickson, 826). In correlation with their sedentary habits, the organization of the Acinetaria is greatly simphfied as compared with the Cihata, and the remarkable structural and functional differentiation of the ectoplasm seen in the Ciliata is wanting altogether in Acinetaria, in which the ectoplasm is relatively a feebly-developed layer. Con- tractile vacuoles are usually present, one or more in number. As in Ciliata, the macronucleus exhibits a great variety of forms. One of the most remarkable is seen in the colonial form Dendrosoma, where the macronucleus is branched to the same degree as the colony, throughout which it extends continuously. The methods of reproduction are more varied, and exhibit a greater speciahzation, in the Acinetaria than in the Ciliata. Simple binary fission in the adult condition is rare in acinetans. Collin (881), hoAvever, has observed division into two or four within a cyst in Podophrya fixa. The fission usually takes the form of bud-forma- tion. The buds may be formed either on the exterior of the body or. in the interior in special brood-cavities, and they may be pro- duced in either case singly and successively or in batclies or relays of several at a time. The bud is usually a simple outgrowth of the cytoplasm containing a prolongation budded off from the macro- nucleus, and one of tlie daughter-nuclei derived from a division of the micronucleus.

68 THE PROTOZOA general rule they are visible more or lass clearly iii the larger but not in the more minute, species. Thus, in trypanosomes, myonemes can be made out m large forms as delicate lines running parallel to the undulatmg membrane (Fig. 28), but in small species of trypano- somes it may be impossible to discover them, although the nature ot their movements may leave no doubt as to the existence of con- tractile mechanisms in the ectoplasm. In other cases, both motile species possessmg myonemes and non-motile species lacking them may occur within the limits of a smgle group, as in Gregarmes, where the motile species show a very distinct layer of myonemes (Fig. 29); while the non-motile forms have a much thinner ecto- plasm, represented practically by the cuticle alone, with no trace of myonemes.

In the ciliate Infusoria the myonemes run parallel to, and beneath, the rows of cilia, and in species of large size and great powers of contractility, such as Stentor, the myonemes are lodged in canals and show a transverse striation (Fig. 186, /). According to Schaudiim, these motile mechanisms, both flagella and myonemes, are derived from the achromatic spindle of a dividing nucleus. In the development of a trypanosome from a non-fiagellated condition, he describes the entire kinetic apparatus as arising from a nuclear spindle consistmg of two polar centro- somes connected by a centrodesmose (p. 103, injra), and by mantle

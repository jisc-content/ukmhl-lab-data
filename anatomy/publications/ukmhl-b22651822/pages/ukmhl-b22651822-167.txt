149 SYNGAMY AND SEX IN THE PROTOZOA period of active reproduction. Cliromidiogamy is a rar(^ but very interestiiig form of syngamy which, from the standpoint of general notions with regard to the evolution of the nucleus, may be re- garded as the most primitive type. It is known to occur also in Difflugia (Zuelzer, 85), where also copulation of swarm-spores takes place as an alternative method (p. 230). A ca.se must now be considered in which the chromidia represent vegetative, while the nuclei contain the generative, chromatin. An example of this state of things is furnished by Plasmodiophora brassicce, a well-known parasite of cabbages, turnips, etc., in which B Fig. 76.â€”Gamete-formation and syngamy in Plasviodiophora hrassicce.

After Prowazek (127)' magnified about 2,250 diameters. it produces a disease Imown as " fingers and toes " (Kohlhernie). According to the investigations of Prowazek (127) and others, Plasmodiophora goes through a development which may be briefly summarized as follows : At the end of the " vegetative " period of growth and multiplication, there are found within the cells of the infected plant a number of " myxamoebse," aanoeboid individuals (Plasmodia) each with many nuclei contaming distinct karyosomes (Fig. 76, ^). From the nuclei chromidia are given off into the cell, and during this process the karyosomes disappear and centro3omes make their appearance (Fig. 76, B, C). The chromidia are ab-

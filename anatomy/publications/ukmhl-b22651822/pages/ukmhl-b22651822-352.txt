Recent researches, however—more especially those of Sehnitzler on Oregarina ovata, Schellack (629) on Echinomera hispida, Leger and Duboscq (621) on Pterocephalus, Robinson on Kalpidorhynchus, Duke on Metamera, and especially Mulsow (123) on Monocystis rostrata—leave no doubt but that tho sporont contains a single large nucleus, which consists chiefly of vegetative chromatin and other substances, but contains also the generative chromatin, relatively minute in quantity in proportion to the whole bulk of tho nucleus.

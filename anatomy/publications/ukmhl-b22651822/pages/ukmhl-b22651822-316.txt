His groundslor S interpretation are, first, that in human blood the adult trypanosomes exhibit a dimorphism rare y found in guinea-pigs infected artificially, in which also schizogony in the lung is seldom observed ; secondly, that the invertebrate liost, Conorhinus, is always rendered infective if fed directly on infected human blood, but very rarely becomes infective if fed on guinea-pigs, even wiien these ainmals show an intense infection. He suggests that the greater resistance of tho human organism to the parasite stimulates the production hoSr"* trypanosome may cease to produce in a less resistant In the more familiar pathogenic species, such as T. hrucii, T. gamhicnse etc. the development m the vertebrate host takes the form mainly of continued multiplication by binary fission simply. Reproduction of this kind may pro- ceed until the trypanosomes swarm in the blood ; or, on the contrary the trypanosomes may be at all times relatively few in number, oven when fatal to their host. T. hrucii, for example, may produce in different hosts an acute or a chronic form of disease ; in the latter case the infected animal may live a long time, and tho parasite exhibits very limited powers of multi- plication. The behaviour of the parasite in the natural hosts to which it is harmless has not been studied. In many pathogenic species, periods of multiplicative activity, during which the trypanosomes are abundant, alternate with periods during which the parasites pass into a resting condition in the internal organs, and become scarce or disappear in the general circulation. In this phase they are alleged to lose their flagollum, diminish in size, and become small, rounded " latent bodies," which, according to Moore and Breinl (484), have only a single nucleus; but according to Fantham they are Leishmania-like, with distinct tropho- nucleus and kinetonucleus. From resting stages of this kind the active trypanosomes are developed again. Laveran (462), however, denies that there is a non-flageUatcd stage of development in the vertebrate host, and considers that the elements described as "latent bodies" represent involution-stages of the parasites—that is to say, forms which have become deformed in structure owing to unfavourable conditions, but not to such an extent as to be incapable of recovery if the conditions improve.

132 THE PROTOZOA by fission or gemination, as in Eoraminifcia (p. 235), Arcella (Fig. 80), etc.—so-called microgamy, which may be isogamous or slightly anisogamous. In the third case, syngamy is between two individuals showing the utmost disparity in size, a tiny micro- gamete and a bulky macrogamete, as in Coccidium (Figs. 69, 152); the result beiiag anisogamy of the most pronounced type. From these facts, it is abundantly clear that syngamy in the Protista cannot be regarded as related specially to reproduction, but as a process affecting the life-cycle as a whole, related equally Tig. 71.-Copulation of Actinophrys sol.

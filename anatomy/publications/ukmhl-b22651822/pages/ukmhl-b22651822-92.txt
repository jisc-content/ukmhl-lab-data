After L6ger and the living condition (Fig. 35) ; compare also Chagas (48 5). Hert- wig (64) has shown that the structure of the nucleus of Adino- sphcerium can be correlated with the functional activities of the cell. Thus a condition with the chromatin all concentrated to form a central endosome is found prior to division of the nucleus, and is also found when the animal is being starved ; on the other hand, when it is supplied with abundant nutriment and is feeding actively, the chromatui-grains spread over the whole nuclear space. Since, however, abundant food also leads to frequent nuclear division, the condition with the chromatin concentrated at the centre also occurs during active cell-metabolism, as well as during hunger-periods. In the simplest condition of the nucleus the grain or grains of chromatin are lodged in a space or vacuole, containing a clear fluid or nuclear sap, but not enclosed by a definite membrane. Nuclei of this simple type of structure are seen in some of the primitive forms, such as the small amoebae of the Zmaa;-type, in which the

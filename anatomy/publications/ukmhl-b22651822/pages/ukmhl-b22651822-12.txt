viii PREFACE tives (" achromatic," etc.) ; since, however, these adjectives have a totally different meanmg and use in optics, they have been altered to chromaiinic, etc., in so far as they relate to chromatin. New terms used in this book are chromidiosome (p. 65, footnote), endosome (p. 73), as an equivalent to the German Binnenkdrper, and gregarinula (p. 169). In conclusion, it is the author's pleasant duty to return thanks to those of his colleagues who have kindly rendered him assistance in his task. He is especially indebted for much help and many valuable suggestions and criticisms to Dr. H. M. Woodcock, whose unrivalled knowledge of recent bibUography has been throughout of the utmost assistance ; and to Dr. J. D. Thomson and Miss Muriel Robertson for many helpful discussions upon matters of fact or theory. Dr. A. G. BagshaAve, Professor J. B. Farmer, F.R.S., Mr. W. F. Lanchester, Dr. C. J. Martin, F.R.S., and Dr. P. Chalmers Mitchell, F.R.S., have kindly read through some of the chapters, and have given valuable advice and criticism. In justice to these gentle- men, however, it should be stated that they are in no way responsible for any of the theoretical opinions put forward by the author. The majority of the figures have been specially drawn from the original sources, or from actual preparations by Mr. R. Brook-Greaves and Miss Mabel Rhodes, to both of whom the author's best thanks are due. LiSTKR Institute of Preventive Medicine, Chelsea, S.W., July 1, 1912.

DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF THE PROTOZOA 7 seen to oecur amongst them. Although thcur metabolism is in general distinctly of a vegetative or saprophytic ty^e, it often exhibits peculiarities not found in any true plant. - In the second grade of the Protista, the organism possesses the characteristics of a true cell, in that the body shows a diffei-entia- tion of the living substance into two quite distinct pait -the cytoplasm, or general body-protoplasm, in which is lodged at least ono nucleus, a body representing a concentration and organiza- tion of the chromatin-substance. In some cases the nuclear sub- stance or chromatin may be in the scattered, cliromidial condition .N. \ ■-. \\ \ \ \ u I ////// ■./ /Av X \ \ I U I / / //// / / V //7//^//ll w Fig. 3.—Actinosphwrimn eichhornii. ecL, Ectoplasm; end., endoplasm ; c.v.'^, a contractile vacuole at its full size ; c.v.^, a contractile vacuole which has just burst if.v., f.v., food vacuoles ; D., a large diatom engulfed in the protoplasm ; ps., pseupopodia ; N., one of the numerous nuclei.

The body- protoplasm may be limited by a firm envelope, or may, on the other hand, be naked, in which case the body-form may be quite in- definite. Organs of locomotion, when present, are of various kinds ; and these organs may serve also for the caj)ture and ingestion of food. And, finally, the metabolism is always one of the four types * For a summary and review of different modes of metabolism among bacterial organisms, see article " Fermentation" in Thorpe's " Dictionary of Applied Chemistry " (Longmans).

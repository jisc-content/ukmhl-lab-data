369 THE H^MOSPORIDIA Labbe described for halteridiura a process of multiplication in the red corpuscle which has never been confirmed. He stated that the nucleus of the parasite divided into a number of small nuclei placed at the two ends of the halter-shaped body, which then divided up into two bimches of small merozoites. It is, of course, possible that the development may differ in different species. But it is more probable that the supposed nuclei at the ends of the body are merely metachromatinic grains, possibly the " alkaliphilous " granules described by Mayer (685, p. 234). 3. The Leucocylozoa.—Tlie true leucocytozoa—that is to say, the species of the genus Leitcocyiozoon of Danilewsky—are only known to occur in the blood of birds, as stated above ; they must be 158.—Ze«coc2/tozoo7i ztemarenj from the blood of the Little Owl, Athene noctua.

The leucocytozoa of birds are found in the blood as bodies usuaUy elongated and spindle-shaped, sometimes, however, rounded m form, which represent each a gametocyte, male or female con- tamed in its host-cell (Pig. 158). The exact composition of these bodies IS, however, a little doubtful; it is not quite certaua where the host-cell ends and the parasite begms. The centre of the body 24

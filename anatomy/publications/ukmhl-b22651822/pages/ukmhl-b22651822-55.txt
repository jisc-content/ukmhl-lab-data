THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PROTOZOA 39 BibliograpTiy.—For references, see p. 477. quently branched at their distal ends, are arranged like radii of the spherical body, projecting freely for some distance from the surface. In other cases the spicules may be disposed tangentially to the body, as in the family Collid(B amongst the Radiolaria, and m other forms belonging to this order. From a simple type of skeleton composed of separate spicules, more complicated types of skeletons are de- rived by fusion of the spicules to form a connected framework. The commonest type of this is a fusion of tangentially-disposed spicules to form a lattice-work ; an example of this is seen m Clathrulina (Fig. 19), in which a lattice-like skeleton is formed at the sm-face of the body, standing off from it like a shell. Skeletons of this type are especially characteristic of the Radiolaria, a group in which the architecture of the skeleton may reach a very high degree of complication and exhibits endless variety. The lattice- like framework, made up of tangentially-arranged spicules united together, may be further strengthened by radially-disposed beams. As the animal grows, it may outgrow the framework first laid down, and another lattice-work is formed concentric with the first, and connected with it by radial beams; later on a third and a fourth such framework is formed, as the organism continues to grow in size. Skeletons formed in this way may be " homaxon "—that is to say, built up on the axes of a sphere ; or " monaxon," with one principal axis ; or may follow various plans of symmetry, or may be asymmetrical (p. 250, infra).

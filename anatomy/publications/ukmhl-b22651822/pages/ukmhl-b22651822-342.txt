322 IBB PKOTOZOA to arise in other directions, as in the digenetic flagellate parasites of Euphorbiaceae. The biflagellate genus Trypanoplasma, on the other hand, com- prises species which, like those of Prowazekia, appear to have been primarily parasites of the vertebrate digestive tract, and which in some cases have established themselves in the blood and have acquired an alternation of hosts (they can hardly be said to have an alternation of generations), having become parasitic in an inter- mediate host, always, so far as is known, a leech, in which they pass through a simple type of development, consisting of little more than simple multiplication by fission. Their structure indicates affinities with heteromastigote types such as Bodo and Trichomonas, common intestinal parasites, rather than with miiflagellate forms. The suggestion is, therefore, that the flagellates parasitic in the blood of vertebrates have two distinct lines of ancestry : the one from heteromastigote forms such as Bodo and Trichomonas, origin- ally parasitic in the gut of the vertebrate and culminating in the genus Trypanoplasma ; the other derived from uniflagellate cer- comonad ancestors originally parasitic in the digestive tracts of invertebrates, and culminating in the genus Trypanosoma (compare also Senn, 358). It must be emphasized strongly, however, that any such conclusions are of a tentative nature, and can have no finality, but are liable to modification with every increase of know- ledge concerning these organisms.

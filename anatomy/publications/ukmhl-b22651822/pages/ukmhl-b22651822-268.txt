248 THE PROTOZOA encystment. Examples: Actinophrys (Eig. 46), Actinos'phoerium (Fig. 3), Camptonema (Fig. 47), etc. Suborder II. : Chlamydopiiora.—Body protected by a soft gela- tinous envelope, but without solid skeletal elements."^ Example: Astrodisculus. Suborder III. : Chalarothoraca.—Body invested by a soft envelope containing isolated spicules, usually siliceous, sometimes ehitinous. Examples : Acanthocystis (Figs. 18, 64, 68), Wagnerella (Figs. 48, 102), He'erophrys (Fig. 103). Suborder IV.: Desmothoraca.—Body invested by a continuous, lattice-like skeleton. Example : ClathruUna (Fig. 19). Fio. 103.—Heteroplirys fockei, Archer. c.,c., Contractile vacuoles ; s., radial ehiti- nous sj^ines surroundmg the envelope. A nucleus is present in the bodj-, but is not shown ; the bodies in the protoplasm represent zooxanthellse. From Weldon and Hickson, after Hertwig and Lesser. A certain number of genera must be mentioned which are of doubtful position, referred by some authorities to the Heliozoa, by others to other orders. Some of these genera perhaps do not represent independent, " adult " forms, but may be only developmental phases of other genera. Nuclearia, classed by some in the Aphrothoraca, by others in the Proteomyxa, has an amoeboid body and pseudopodia without axes. As described above (p. 177 and Fig. 80), a Nuclearia-stage occurs in the development of Arcella. Especially remarkable are certain genera which indicate a close relation- ship between Heliozoa and Flagellata. An account of several such forms is given by Penard (302), in addition to which the following may be noted: Ciliophrys, Cienkowski, has two phases ; in the one it appears as a typical Heliozoon with stiff radiating pseudopodia ; in the other it is a typical flagellate. In the process of transformation the Heliozoon-form retracts its pseudopodia, its body becomes ajnoebpid, .and a flagellum grows out; finally

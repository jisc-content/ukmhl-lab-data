THE PROTOZOA 264 subtilis (Fig. Ill) by Dobell (335). In this species the two gametes appear perfectly similar to each other, and are not, in fact, distin- guishable in any way from ordinary individuals of the species. Two such individuals come together and unite by their anterior or flagellar extremities. In one gamete the flagellum is lost, and the couple swims about by means of the re- maining one ; this is the only difference between the two gametes which could be interpreted as one of sex. While fusion of the bodies is still incomplete, the nucleus of each gamete divides by a simple type of promitosis (p. 109). One of each pair of sister- nuclei thus produced is a reduction - nucleus, which degenerates ; the other persists. The per- sistent nucleus of each gamete then divides a second time, but into two very unequal halves; the smaller nucleus in each case degenerates as a reduction - nucleus, while the larger persists as the pronucleus. The bodies of the gametes are now completely fused, and the fusion of the pronuclei follows. The zygote may become en- cysted at once, or may continue to live a free life. In the first case the fusion of the pro- nuclei takes place within the cyst, from which it is ultimately set free as an ordinary individual which feeds and multiplies vegeta- tively. In the second case the zygote becomes an ordmary free individual at once, the interlude of encystment being omitted. Pig. 111.—Life-cycle of Gopromonas subtilis.

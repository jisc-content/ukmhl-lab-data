THE PROTOZOA 190 According to Rhumblor (204), with a more fluid condition of the ectoplasm, the food is ingested by import or circumfluence; when the ectoplasm is stiffened to a membrane-hke consistence, the ingestion is effected by cii'cumvallation or invagination. Rhumbler maintains that all known methods of food-ingestion by amoebae, as well as their movements, can be explained mechanically by differ- ences of surface-tension in colloidal limiting membranes, and can be imitated artificially in substances that arc not living.

A-E Five stages of tiie process, semi-diagrammatic; diagrammatic fiaure'to show the direction of the currents on the surface of the body of tlio amceba during the process of ingestion. After Grosse-AUermann (245). In corticate forms the ingestion of food is hmited to one or more special openings or organs, in which a direct communication is estabhshed between the fluid endoplasm and the surromidmg medium, as in the cytostomes of FlageUata and CiUata and the suctorial tentacles of Acinetaria. The dic^estion of the food is effected within the protoplasmic body, and as a'nile the prey is taken bodily into the cytoplasm ; but the Acinetaria have the power, not fully explained, of sucking out

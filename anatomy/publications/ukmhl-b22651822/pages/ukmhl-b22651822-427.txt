THE HiEMOSPORIDIA 397 form probably used its flagellum for the purpose of attaching itseK to "le opitliium of the digestive traet, as leptomonads do now (oornpare Figs. 126, 137) ; cand from this primitive type of attach- ie7the epLerite of the gregarines may have been derived by secretion of chitm round the attaehmg flagellum ]ust as the px^tTve tuft of fixing ciha, the " scapula - of the prmutive VoXeUids appears to become converted into the chitmous stalks of such forms as (p. 441). .-, ^.

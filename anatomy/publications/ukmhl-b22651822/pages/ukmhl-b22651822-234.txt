THE PROTOZOA 216 between swarm-spores, either amoebulse or flagellulae. The microg- amy is isogamous or slightly anisogamous ; macrogamy, as in other cases, is perfectly isogamous. Microgamy occurs, as has been seen (p. 148), in Arcella in addition to chromidiogamy ; and, according to a recent note of Zuelzer (86, p. 191, footnote), syngamy between free swarm-spores occurs in Difflugia also. As regards the life-cycle of the Sarcodina, there remains still so much to be discovered that to generalize is both difficult and dangerous. Even in the commonest forms, such as Amoeba proteus, the complete life-cycle has not been yet worked out. In some Fig. 85.—Changes in the form of an amoeba under the influence of diiierencea in the surrounduag medium.

After Verworn. cases the life-cycle appears to be of comparatively simple type, and the species is monomorphic or nearly so, as in AclinosphcBrium ; in other cases there is a well-marked alternation of generations, with dimorphism in the adult condition, as in TrichospJmrmm (p. 182), the Foraminifera, etc. Classification.—The Sarcodina are subdivided into a number of orders, the distinctions between which are based prmcipally on the characters of the pseudopodia and of the skeleton, when present; in more highly differentiated forms, such as Radiolaria, the internal structure of the body is also taken into account.

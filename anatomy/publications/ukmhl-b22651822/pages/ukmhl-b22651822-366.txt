The merozoites (agametes), the daughter-individuals produced by schizogony, are set free from the remams of the host-ceU (cyto- cyst). Each merozoite is very similar to a sporozoite in form, structure, and movements, differing only in minor points of detail; for mstance, in C. schubergi the nucleus of the merozoite has a distmct karyosome, wanting in that of the sporozoite. The merozoites penetrate into epithelial cells, and become trophozoites which may develop in one or the other of two ways—(1) into schizonts again, repeatmg the schizogony already described; (2) into sporonts (gamonts), destined to produce gametes and resistant propagative phases. 5. The growth of the sporonts is slower than that of the schizonts, and differs in the two sexes ; in the male sporont (Fig. 152, Q S) the cytoplasm remains clear, free from enclosures, but in the female (Fig. 152, G ? ) it becomes crowded with reserve nutriment, stored up as a provision for the reproductive phases, in the form chiefly of so-called " plastinoid spherules." In G. schuhergi the female sporonts differ also from the spherical male form in being bean-shaped, but this is a specific peculiarity. In some species the female sporonts are very much larger than the male, as in Adelea ovata (Fig. 154), Orcheobius herpobdellce, etc. In the last-named species, parasitic in the testis of the leech Herpohdella aiomaria, the trophozoites which become schizonts are parasitic in the cytophores; but the merozoites destined to become sporonts are quite motionless, and lie free in the lymph, whence they are taken up passively by the lymphocytes, often several by one such cell. In the lymphocytes they associate in couples, a male and a female sporont together, and the female sporonts grow into long, monocystid-like bodies (Kunze). 6. When full-grown, the sporonts proceed to gamete-formation: (a) In the male sporonts (Fig. 50, p. 102 ; Fig. 152, J, / c?) the nucleus gives off chromidia into the cytoplasm, and the chromidia collect at the surface of the body ; the old nucleus, now much poorer in chromatin, and with its karyosome still distinct, remams in the centre of the body. The chromidia become condensed and con- centrated into patches to form secondary nuclei, which finally take shape as elongated compact bodies consisting of dense chromatin ; each such nucleus, together with an almost imperceptible quantity of cytoplasm, forms the body of a male gamete (microgamete), and is set free, while the greater part of the body of the sporont, together with its old nucleus, degenerates and dies off as residual protoplasm.

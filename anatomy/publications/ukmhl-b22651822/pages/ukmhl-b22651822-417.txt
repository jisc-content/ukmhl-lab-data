THE H^.MOSPORIDIA 387 From the foregoing it is seen that the development of piroplasms appears to be of a type essentially similar to that of the haem- amoeba; and hsemogregarines. In the present fragmentary state of our knowledge, however, it would be premature to generalize con- cerning the development of these forms. The most noteworthy feature of the development is the entire absence of flagellated forms from the life-cycle. The alleged flagellate forms of P. canis in the dog's blood described by Breml and Hindle have been dealt with above; it only remains to be mentioned that Miyajima obtained trypanosomes in cultures of the blood of calves suffering from piroplasmosis, an observation which led to the discovery of a trypanosome in calves not previously known to exist (see p. 283). Doubtful Genera of Hcemosporidia.—A certain number of blood- parasites have been described which at present are not sufficiently well known to make it possible to assign to them a definite systematic position. When more thoroughly investigated, many of them may turn out to belong to other groups than the H£emosporidia ; it is even possible that some of these bodies are not parasites at all, but merely some forms of cell-enclosures. The genus Toxoplasma was founded by Nicolle and Manceaux (754) for T. gondii, a parasite of the gondi {Cienodactylus gondii); other species have smce been described—namely, T. cuniculi, Carini, from the rabbit, T canis MeUo, from the dog, and T. talpce, Prowazek, from the mole. The organisms in question are parasites of the white blood-corpuscles, and occur most abundantly in the spleen or liver, causing a disease which is frequentlv fatal ihe parasite is a crescent-shaped body, with one end thicker than the other" and contamuig a single nucleus ; they multiply by bmary or multiple fission' NicoUe and Manceaux regarded them as aUied to Leishmania, but [their resemblance to this genus appears to be purely superficial, since in Toxovlasma no kmetonucleus IS present, and in cultures no flageUated stage is developed Mleipsisoma thomsoni is the name given by Franca (441) to a nara^if a he blood of moles discovered by ThoLon (624). It oUurs as a^amSboid mtracorpuscular parasite with a single nucleus situated at the margin of the body, which contams no melanin-pigment. Multiplication takes place ex clusively m the Imig, and is by binary or multiple fission, according to Franca the young forms are either vermiform, with the nucleus drawn out or oval' with a compact nucleus; they penetrate into the corpuscles ^d grow t£' Franga considers this form to be allied to Toxoplasma ^ 1 w "^f^^ ^"i^?""'^ S^^*^^ ^^^"5^ (440) to certam bodies in th« red blood-corpuscles of batrachia, first described by Todd.

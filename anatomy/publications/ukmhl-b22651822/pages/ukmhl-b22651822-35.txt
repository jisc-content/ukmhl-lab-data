19 THE MODES OF LIFE OF THE PROTOZOA or ui-iuary organs, etc., cither living free iu the cavity it inhabits, or attached to the linmg epithelium. As diverse as the modes of iDarasitism among Protozoa are the elTects they produce on then' hosts. Some parasites produce no perceptible disturbance in the well-bemg of then- host; oven when they destroy cells and portions of tissues, the damage may be slight, and is quickly made good without appreciable permanent uajury being done. From this condition of more or less perfect harmless- ness there is a continuous gradation in the ascending capacity for harmfulness, culminatuag m species which bring about the death of then- hosts with greater or less rapidity. Hence parasitic Protozoa are commonly distmguished as pathogenic or non-pathogenic ; but smce there is no precise limit to the degree of sickness or indis- position which justifies the application of the term " pathogenic," it is perhaps more convenient to distinguish them as lethal or non- lethal. It is not possible, however, to lay down hard-and-fast distmctions in these matters, since a parasite which is not lethal under some ckcumstances may become so under others ; for instance an animal living a free and natural life may be quite well able to resist the attacks of parasites to which it succumbs in captivity Moreover, it must be borne in mind that such terms as "lethal" or " pathogenic " can only be applied to a parasite in its relation to a particular host, smce, as wUl be shown below, a parasite which is harmful to one host may be harmless to another. It is far fi-om clear in what way the pathogenic effects of parasitic Protozoa are produced. If the action and reaction of host and parasite were relations dependent simply on the number or relative total bulk of parasites present in a given host, the problems of parasitism would be comparatively simple ; but in many cases this IS obviously very far from being the case.

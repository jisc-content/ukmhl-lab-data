I AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE PROTOZOA CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY â€” THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF THE PROTOZOA AND OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBDIVISIONS The Protozoa are a very large and important group of organisms, for the most part of minute size, which exhibit a wide range of variation in structural and developmental characters, correlated with the utmost diversity in their modes of life. Nevertheless, however greatly adaptation to the conditions of life may have modified their form, structure, or physiological properties, a certain type of organization is common to all members of the group. The most salient feature of the Protozoa is their unicellular nature ; that is to say, the individual in this subdivision of living beings is an organism of primitive character, in which the whole body has the morphological value of a single " cell," a mass of protoplasm containing nuclear substance (chromatin) concentrated into one or more nuclei. However complex the structure and functions of the body, the organs that it possesses are parts of a cell (" organella "), and are never made up of distinct cells ; and at least one nucleus is present, or only temporarily absent, as a constant integral part of the organism. The unicellular nature of the Protozoa, though a constant character, cannot, however, be used by itself to define the group, since it is also a peculiarity of many other distinct types of simple living things. As an assemblage of organisms of primitive nature from which, in all probability, the ordinary plants and animals have originated in the remote past by divergent processes of evolution, the Protozoa have always possessed very great mterest from the purely scientific and philosophical point of view. Of recent years, however, they have also acquired great practical importance from the relations that have been discovered to exist between Protozoa of parasitic habit and many diseases of man and animals. Hence the study of the Protozoa has received an immense impetus, and has been

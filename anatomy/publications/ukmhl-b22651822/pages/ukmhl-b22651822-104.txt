Pig. 43.-—Stages in the division of Polylomdla agilis. A, Resting condition of the cell; the four flagolla arise from four blepharoplasts which arc connected by a rhizoplast with the nucleus ; in the nucleus is seen a largo karyosome, which contains the centriolc and is surrounded by a peripheral zone of chromatin-grains in a nuclear reticulum. B, Early stage of mitosis ; the karyo- some is dividing to form a bar of chromatin occupying the axis of the achro- matinic spindle, at the equator of which a plate of chromosomes is formed by the peripheral chromatin of the last stage. C, Later stage; the karyosome has divided completely, forming two masses at the poles of the spindle con- nected by a centrodesmose. D, The spindle has become elongated, and the equatorial plate has split; the centrioles are seen connected by the centro- desmose. E. Division advancing ; the polar masses have become cap-shaped, and the daughter-plates of chromosomes have fused into conical masses ; centrioles and centrodesmose still visible. F, Division of body beginning. 0, Centrodesmose broken through, the two daughter-nuclei separate. H, I, J, Division of cell complete, one daughter-cell only represented, to show the reconstitution of the daughter-nucleus ; the polar cap becomes the Icaryosome, enclosing the centriole ; the conical mass formed in Stage E by fusion of tlie chromosomes in the daughter-plates becomes resolved gradually into chromatin-grains again, and so forms the peripheral zone of the daughter- nucleus • each daughter-cell has two of the four blepharoplasts and flagella of the parent, and the number is doubtless made up to four agani by division after the daughter-cells are set free.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAIN SUBDIVISIONS 469 respect between spirochaetos and trypanosomes and other flagellates. In the M'ords of Dobell, " the nuclear and cytoplasmic structures are wholly different; a trypanosomc has a flagollum, a spiroclitcte has none ; the crista is not an undulating membrane ; the cell-membranes arc not similar ; and, moreover, the method of division is quite different in the two organisms." Doflein (7) places the spirochsetes as a group named the Pro- flagellata, supposed to be transitional from bacteria to flagellates. Zuelzer (904) takes a similar view, rejecting, however, any affinity between spirochaetes and Hartmann's " Binucleata." Awerinzew (890) puts forward the remarkable suggestion that the Flagellata " pass on into different Binucleata, and end with the Spirochceia Fig. 194.—Stages in the division of Cristispira peclinis. A, D, Two successive stages of the incurvation ; C, incurvation complete ; D, division of the body at the point where it is bent back; E, F, separation of the two daughter- spirochastes. After Gross (897). {sic)," from which it would appear that he regards the spirochsetes as the last product of the hne of evolution that produced the trypanosonies and allied forms. For the various reasons that have been set forth above, it appears impossible to include the spirochsetes any longer in the Protozoa. Dobell regards them as "an independent group of unicellular organisms which show very little affinity to any other group." Gross, on the other hand, considers that the Spironemacea—^■.e., the genera Cristispira, Saprospira, and Spironema, in the sense in which this genus is understood by him (see above)—form a family which can be ranked in the bacteria, but which is related to the Cyanophycese, especially the Oscillatoriae.

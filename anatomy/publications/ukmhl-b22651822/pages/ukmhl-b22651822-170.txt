I'HE PROTOZOA 162 77^Diagram showing the successive stages of conjugation in Infusoria. A, The two conjugants attached, each with a macionucleus (N) and a micro- nucleus (w); B, G, the micronucleus of each conjugant dividing; D, each conjugant has two micronuclei which are beginning to divide again ; E, each conjugant has four micronuclei ; the macronuclei are beginning to become irregular in form ; in later stages they degenerate, break up, and are absorbed ; three of the four micronuclei of each conjugant are degenerating and being absorbed ; the fourth is dividing ; G, one half of each dividing micro- nucleus of the preceding stage has travelled over into the other conjugant as the migratory pronucleus ; H, I, fusion of the stationaiy pronucleus of each conjugant with the migratory pronucleus derived from the other conjugant to form the synkaryon {S.) ; J, the two conjugants now separate ; in each ex-conjugant the sjoikaryon [8.) divides ; the old macronuclei are now almost completely absorbed ; K, L, the synkaryon has divided into two nuclei, one of which grows large and becomes the new macronucleus, the other remains small and becomes the new micronucleus, of each ex-conjugant.

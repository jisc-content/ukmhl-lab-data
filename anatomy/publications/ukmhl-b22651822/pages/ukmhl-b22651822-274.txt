THE PROTOZOA 254 divides by a mitosis remarkable for the vast number of chromo- somes, of which there may be over a thousand, and the apparent absence of a centrosome. The more usual method of reproduction however, is formation of flagellated swarm-spores by a process of rap;d multiple fission within the central capsule. Two kinds of swarm-spores are produced, which are known respectively as " isospores " and " anisospores." The isospores (Fig. 108, A), which are probably agametes, are all similar in size and appearance, and frequently contain a crystal in their protoplasm, and are hence sometimes termed " crystal-spores." The anisospores (Fig. 108, Fio. 107.â€”Actinomma asteracanthion: semi-diagrammatic to show the mode of growth of the skeleton.

B, G), probably gametes, are of two kinds, smaller microspores and larger macrospores ; they differ in structure from the isospores, and lack the characteristic crystal. The swarm-spores vary in struc- ture in different species, but usually have two flagella. Isospores and anisospores are formed in different individuals, but it is still a moot point whether an alternation of generations occurs. Micro- spores and macrospores may be formed in the same individual in some species ; in others they are produced by different individuals. Previous to formation of the swarm-spores the extracapsular region of the body disintegrates, and the central capsule with its contents

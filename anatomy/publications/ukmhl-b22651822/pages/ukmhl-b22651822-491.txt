Ophryodendron. . ^ Affinities of the Acinetaria.—The presence of cilia in the young stages, the possession of distmct vegetative macronuclei and generative mieronuclei, and the process of conjugation, similar in all essential details to that of tJie binata, can leave no doubt as to the position of the Acinetaria in the class Infusoria, and their affinities with the Cihata. Collin, in a series of interesting studies, has drawn attention to many points indicating a close relationship between Acinetaria and Vorticellids, more especially the structural homologies between the larv£e of the one and the free-swimming stages of the other group ; for example, the peritrichous arrangement of the cilia, the rudimentary adoral zone at the posterior pole, and the fixation by means of a scopula like organ at the anterior pole, points especially well seen in the larva of Tocophyra cyclopum.

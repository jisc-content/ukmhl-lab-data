102 THE PROTOZOA stance appears to be the passive subject of the changes that are effected. With the achromatinic nuclear elements, extranuclear cytoplasmic substances/such as archoplasm, may collaborate. After A B Fig. 50.—Formation of microgamotes in Coccidium schubergi. A, Full-grown microgametocyte, with finely-granular cytoplasm and large nucleus con- taining a conspicuous karyosome ; freed from the host-cell. B, The nuclear membrane has disappeared, and the chromatin, in the form of minute chro- midial granules, is passing out into the cell. C, The chromidia have collected at the periphery of the body ; the karyosome is left at the centre, and has become jjale through loss of chromatin-substance. D, The chromidia, seen on the surface of the body, are collecting together into irregular streaks and clumps. E, The chromatin-streaks of the preceding stage are collecting together into patches. F, The patches of chromatin of the preceding stage have become dense and closely packed. 0, H. The patches of chromatin take on a definite form as the future nuclei of the microgamotes. /, Two flagella grow out from close to each microgamete-nucleus, and by their activity the microgamotes, consisting almost entirely of chromatin, break loose from the body of the gametocyte and swim away. J, Three micro- gametes, more highly magnified ; in each, two flagella arise from the thicker eind ; one of the flagella (the shorter) becomes free at once, the other (the longer) runs along the body and becomes free at the hinder end.

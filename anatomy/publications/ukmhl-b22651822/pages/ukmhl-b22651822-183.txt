POLYMORPHISM AND LIFE-CYCLES 165 thereby becomes denser in consistence, but of less specific gravity. Lastly, the cyst-membrane itself appears round the body, if it has not already done so ; it generally stands off distinctly from the surface of the body, and may vary in nature in different cases, from a soft, slimy or gelatinous coat to a firm membrane of variable thickness, often exceedingly tough and impervious. In the encysted state. Protozoa are able to withstand the many vicissitudes to which they are naturally subject. They can then be dried up, frozen, or sun-baked ; and since the protoplasm becomes much lighter, they can be transported great distances by winds, a fact which accounts for the appearance of Protozoa in infusions exposed to the air in any situation—a peculiarity from which the name Infusoria is derived. In general the function of encystment is to protect the organism against unfavourable conditions or violent changes in the environment—for instance, in freshwater forms, against drought and climate, the cold of whiter or the heat of a tropical summer. In parasitic forms it is an adaptation commonly connected with a change from one host to another. In parasites two types of cysts can be distinguished. In the first place, full-grown forms may produce relatively large, resistant cysts (Dauerzysten) of the ordinary type, almost invariably spherical or ovoid m form. In the second place, the smallest forms in the developmental cycle, the products of multiple fission or " sporulation," may secrete round themselves tough, resistant envelopes, within which they may multiply further ; in this case the envelope is termed a syorocyst, and the entire body a spore.* * The word " spore " has come to be used in two distinct senses, as applied to -Protozoa thereby producing a regrettable confusion and ambiguity. The word itselt IS denved from the Greek crwdpos, a seed, and was applied by botanists to those cases where plants produce seed-like bodies which are not true seeds • for mstance, the seed of an ordinary flowermg plant is a complete embryo, with'root and shoot distmct, encapsuled in protective envelopes, but the " seed " of a fern is merely a smgle cell enclosed in a protective membrane.

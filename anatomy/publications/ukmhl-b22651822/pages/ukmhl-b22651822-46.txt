30 THE PROTOZOA homogeneous-that is to say, of simUar nature in all parts ; if However, its surface be heterogeneous, and differs in different parts, local niequahties of surface-tension may be the result, and then a perlectly spherical form cannot be maintained so long as the surface remains heterogeneous. Thus an organism, such as an amoeba, in which the protoplasm is quite naked and exposed at the surface of the body, tends always to have a spherical form in the resting state ; but when it enters upon a phase of vital activity, it may assume various forms which can be explained by supposing that the surface- tension is altered at one or more regions of the surface as the result Fig. 13.â€”Tlialassicdla {Thcdassophysa) pelagica, Haeckel, an example of a species of floating habit combined with radiate symmetry and spherical body-form. OK, Central capsule ; EP, extracapsular protoplasm ; al, vacuoles in the calymma (see p. 251) ; ps., psoudoiJodia. The small dots in the calymma represent " yellow cells " (p. 252). After Lankester, magnified 25 diameters. of local changes in chemical constitution, brought about by the vital activity of the protoplasm (Rhumbler, 34, and j). 200 infra). In consequence, the spherical form characteristic of the resting state undergoes modification in various ways when the organism becomes active. In floating forms the sphere throAvs out radiating processes, so-called " pseudopodia," in all directions (Figs. 3, 13). In creeping species the body assumes the indefinite and constantly changmg form, with pseudopodia extruded in every direction, which is characteristic of the amoeba (Fig. 2), and hence commonly termed " amoeboid." In all such cases, when the animal passes into a

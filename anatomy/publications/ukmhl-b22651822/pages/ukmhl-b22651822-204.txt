CHAPTER X THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA The Protozoa, as has been seen in the previous chapters, exhibit a wide range of structural differentiation, from forms which exemplify a ceU reduced to its simplest essential parts, nucleus and cytoplasm, to others in which the cytoplasmic elements give rise in different parts of the body to a great variety of structures and organs, each subservient to some special function. In the Protozoa of simplest structure, therefore, the study of the physiological activities of the organism coincides, more or less, with that of the elementary properties of the living substance, protoplasm, its pecuhar powers of metabohsm and transmutation of energy ; while in Protozoa of comphcated organization the mechanism and mode of action of the various cell-organs must be considered in relation to their structure, so far as it can be made out. It is not possible to discuss adequately, in the limited space of a chapter, the intricate problems, for the most part still very obscure, of the vital mechanisms of elementary organisms. The matter can only be dealt with here on broad general lines, and those desirous of studying the subject fm-ther must consult the references given to special works or memoirs .* On the other hand, the special functions and mechanisms of the various ceU-organs (" organelW) have been considered in describing the structure of the organs themselves. In this chapter, therefore, it is intended rather to fiU the gaps left in previous chapters ; and the physiological problems presented by the Protozoa will be sketched in brief outhne under the foUowmg headings • (1) Nutrition and Assimilation ; (2) Respiration ; (3) Secre- tion and Excretion ; (4) Transmutation of Energy ; (5) Reactions to Stimuh and to Changes of Medium or Environment; (6) Degenera- tion and Regeneration. * For works dealing with the physiology of Protozoa iii a i^I^^I^iJ„t should consult especially Verworn, " Allgememe ^y^^-}'^^'^^^^^^^^ ^^Zs

37 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PROTOZOA either case the spicules grow by accretion—that is to say, by deposi- tion of fresh layers of inorganic substance upon that already laid doAvn—and if such accretion takes place at one end of a rod-shaped spicule, it may have the result that the opposite extremity of the spicule is pushed outwards by the continued growth, with the result that the oldest portion of the spicule projects freely far beyond the limits of the body. As regards material, spicules are usually either calcareous or siliceous—in the first case generally carbonate of lime, in the second Fig. 18.—Acanthocystis chcetophora, a Heliozoon with a skeleton of slender radiating siliceous spicules, each forked at the distal end. In the interior of the body- are seen numerous symbiotic algse (dark) and non-contractile vacuoles (clear); one vacuole of larger size is seen, probably the contractile vacuole, sp., sp., Spicules ; ps., ps., pseudopodia. After Leidy, magnified 750 diameters. case amorphous silica. In the family Acanthometridce among the Radiolaria the spicules are formed of a substance which was thought to be of organic nature, and was named " acanthin," but which has been found to consist of strontium sulphate. As regards their form and relation to the body, the spicules in the simplest cases are rod-shaped or needle-like elements disposed radially or tangentially, A simple type of spicular skeleton is seen in Acanthocystis (Fig. 18), in which elongated siliceous rods, fre-

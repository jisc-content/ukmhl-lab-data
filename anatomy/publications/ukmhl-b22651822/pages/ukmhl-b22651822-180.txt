162 CHAPTER IX POLYMORPHISM AND LIFE-CYCLES OF THE PROTOZOA A. Polymorphism. One of the most striking peculiarities of living beings is the infinite variety of form, structure, and appearance, which they present. There is, perhaps, no livmg individual of any kind which is exactly similar, in all respects, to any other. Nevertheless, the most uncultured intellect cannot fail to recognize that, in the case of all ordinary, familiar plants and animals there is a pronounced tendency to segregation into distinct kinds or species—that is to say, natural groups of individuals which, though they may vary greatly amongst themselves, yet resemble one another far more than they do the individuals of another species. It is not necessary to point out that species are not to be regarded as permanent or immutable entities. It is certain that a species may in course of time become modified so as to acquire characters different from those it origmally possessed, thus giving rise to a new species, or that a single parent-species may become split up into a number of groups which, by a similar process of modification, became so many daughter-species differmg from one another and from the parent- species to a gi-eater or less degree. The problem of the origin of species is one that it is not necessary to discuss here ; it is suflacient to point out that the mutability of species often makes it very difficult to define or delimit a given species exactly, of which a striking example is seen in the pathogenic trypanosomes of the 6mcn-group, probably to be regarded, as pointed out above (p 27), as instances of species in an incipient or nascent conditiom Some species are sharply marked off from others, some are much less so, and some are of questionable rank, regarded by one naturalist as distinct, by another as mere races or varieties—a state of thmgs perfectly intelligible if existing species are regarded as havmg arisen by descent, with modification, from pre-existing species. In the Protozoa the existence of distinct species is just as marked as in the higher plants and animals, and is universally recognized. As has been pointed out in the previous chapter, it is probably syngamy which is responsible for the segregation of mdividuals

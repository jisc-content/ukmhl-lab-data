THE PROTOZOA 96 chromatin-elements ; while the cell-nucleus proper would represent the trophic nucleus deprived of all kinetic elements. On the other hand, the condition in amoeba3 and similar or- ganisms, where the cell appears to contain but a single nucleus which includes the kinetic centres, is explained by supposing that here the kinetic nucleus is encapsuled in the trophic nucleus, and is represented by the karyosome with its centriole ; hence the supporters of this theory term the type of nucleus characterized by a large karyosome an " amphinucleus " or " amphikaryon," and, in their descriptions of such nuclei, they speak of the outer nucleus (peripheral zone of chromatin) and the inner nucleus (karyosome). The reasons against homologizing the karyosome and the extra- nuclear centrosome have been stated already. Against the theory of binuclearity it may be urged furtherâ€”First, that to regard the protokaryon-type of nucleus seen in the most primitive forms of Sarcodina and Flagellata as a secondary condition is a complete inversion of what is, to all appearance, the natural series of evolu- tion of the nuclear apparatus ; secondly, that the binucleate con- dition of trypanosomes and allied forms is clearly, by comparison with other Flagellates, a specialized condition ; the trophonucleus of trypanosomes also contains a karyosome and centriole, and would therefore be an " amphikaryon," on this theory ; thirdly, that the binuclear theory still leaves the centriole as a kinetic centre of achromatinic origin, which is present in both trophonucleus and kinetonucleus of trypanosomes, in both nucleus and central grain of Heliozoa {Wagnerella), etc. All that the binuclear theory is capable of explaining is the secondary elements of the extra- nuclear centrosomic complex. That the centriole is a body of intranuclear origin and formation is shown clearly by its presence in nuclei of the primitive karyosomatic type which arise, not by division of pre-existing nuclei, but by aggregation and organization of clumps of chromidia. It should be added that, in its most recent exposition by Hartmann (61), the theory of binuclearity has undergone considerable modification and restriction. Having considered now the structure and composition of the nucleus in its pruicipal types and morphological variations, it remains to attempt to establish a more precise conception as to what exactly is meant by a nucleus. It is evident, in the first place, that the essential component of a nucleus, never absent, is chromatin ; but it is equally clear, in the second place, that a simple mass, or several such masses, of chromatin, do not by themselves constitute a nucleus in the true sense of the word. The word " chro- matin" connotes an essentially physiological and biological con- ception, as it were, of a substance, far from uniform in its chemical

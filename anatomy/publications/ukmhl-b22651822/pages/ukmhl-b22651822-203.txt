185 POLYMORPHISM AND LIFE-CYCLES vertebrate host to another, it is probable that it could dispense alto- gether with the sexual cycle, which occurs only in the invertebrate host, so far as is Icnown. In the suborder Eugregarinse of the Gregarinoidea an opposite condition occurs, since these forms possess only the sexual cycle, sporogony, and there is no non-sexual schizogony. Whether this condition is to be regarded as a primitive state of things, or whether the Eugregarines are to be regarded as having dispensed with the non-sexual process of schizogony seen in the alUed suborder Schizogregarinse, must remain an open question. A further caution is also necessary with regard to the alternation of generations in Protozoa. From the known facts of the malarial hfe-cycle, in which an alternation of sexual and non-sexual cycles is correlated with an alternation of hosts, it has often been assumed, imphcitly or exphcitly, that a similar alternation of sexual and non- sexual cycles must occur in other cases where there is an alternation of hosts, as in the case of trypanosomes, and in particular that the sexual cycle must occur in the invertebrate host. This assumption is by no means justified, however, and has been the cause of much unsound or unwarranted interpretation of the facts, especially as regards the significance of the various forms of trypanosomes, which are continually ascribed to sexual differentiation on no other ground than the bare fact of form-differentiation, as pointed out in the previous chapters. Up to the present there is not a single case m which sexual phenomena in trypanosomes have been described m a perfectly satisfactory manner, free from all doubt; and, on the other hand, it has been asserted that the syngamy occurs in the vertebrate host in these parasites (Ottolenghi, 492).

THE PROTOZOA 106 chromatin is halved irregularly; no definite chromosomes are formed, but the grains of peripheral chromatin form clumps and masses of various shapes and sizes. A definite acliromatinic spindle Fig. 51.—Formation of the karyosome and division of the nucleus in the schizont of Coccidium schubergi. A, Nucleus of the sporozoite, with scattered grains of chromatin but no karyosome. B, C, D, Nuclei of young schizonts in which larger grains of chromatin collect together at the centre to form the karyo- some. E, Nucleus of older schizont with complete karyosome. F, Nucleus of full-grown schizont. G—M, Division of the nucleus of the schizont; the chromatin of the nucleus becomes aggregated into larger clumps and the karyosome becomes dumb-bell-shaped, with masses of chromatin at each pole {G and H) ; the two daughter-karyosomes, at first connected by a fila- ment or centrodesmose, travel apart, taking the polar clumps of chromatin with them (/) ; the centrodesmose breaks through and disappears, and the two daughter-nuclei travel apart, with formation of an intermediate body on the filament between them (J—L) ; finally the connecting filament breaks down and the daughter-nuclei separate (M). k^, Karyosome; F, F, daughter- karyosomes ; 1, intermediate body.

A, The it^ting nucleus; B, 0, D, clumping together of the ehromatin-granuies preparatory to division ; E, F, G, the nucleus elongates and becomes dumb- bell shaped; H, the nucleus has just divided into two hahes. After Schaudinn (99), magnified 2,250. also does not become difierentiated. As the daughter-karyosomes connected by a centrodesmose, travel apart, half the periphera chromatin follows one karyosome, half the other. This method of

THE PROTOZOA tion for developmental changes, especially in the female gamete m a manner analogous to yolk-grains in an ovum. Instances o^ bodies resultn.g from catabolic activity are waste-products of various kmds in the form of granules, crystals, pigment-grains, etc., often present m great numbers, and giving the endoplasm an opaque and coarsely-granular appearance. A" familiar instance of such waste- products IS seen in the grains of melanin-pigment formed in the bodies of the malarial parasites (Fig. 156) as a result of the absorp- tion and decomposition of the haemoglobin of the red blood-cor- puscle. Many bodies present in the protoplasm of Protozoa may be con- sidered as originally of metaplastic nature and origin but as utilized secondarily for various functions. Such are the oil-drops m the mtracapsular protoplasm of Radiolaria (p. 251), which appear to have a hydrostatic function, and also to serve as reserve food- material in the development. It is also highly probable that both mternal and external skeletons originated simply as excretions in the first instance —that is to say, as waste - products of the metabolism which have been utilized for the function of support, and subsequently adapted and modified in accordance with the special requirements of the organism. Finally, as bodies of hydrostatic function, though not to be included necessarily under metaplastic products, are the peculiar gas-vacuoles of Arcella, bubbles of gas which can be secreted, absorbed, and formed again, as circumstances may require, in and by the living protoplasm.

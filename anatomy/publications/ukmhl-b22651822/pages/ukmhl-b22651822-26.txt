THE PROTOZOA 10 The attempt, therefore, made in the following paragraph to give a diagnosis of the Protozoa must not be regarded as a definition of the group in the rigidly logical sense, but merely as the construc- tion of a general type^ the characters of which are liable to a certain amount of variation in special cases—a compromise between the claims of logic and the versatility of Nature. The Protozoa, then, are Protista in which the organization is of the cellular type, with nucleus distinct from the cytoplasm. They are uni- cellular, in the sense that the cell constitutes an entire individual, which may exist singly and in- dependently or in the form of cell- colonies ; but in the latter case the cells are not subordinated to the individuality of the entu'e ceU- aggregate by the formation of e.v.

The body protoplasm is naked or clothed with a fii-m envelope, which is usually not of the natm^e of cellulose. Proto- plasmic organs are usuaUy present for purposes of locomotion and for the capture and ingestion of food. Cldorophyll is usually absent as a cell-constituent, and the metabolism is usually of the animal type. To these characters it may be added, though not as special peculiarities of Protozoa, that reproduction takes place

161 SYNGAMY AND SEX IN THE! PR0T020A minute bodies reproduction by fission does not ijroduce differentia- tion in the fission-products. With increased size such differences may arise, at first to a minor extent, and capable of being adjusted by uiternal rearrangements of the livuig substance such as liave been described in. the larger Bacteria. Not until the process of natm-al evolution had gone so far as to produce the full complica- tion of structure seen in a true cell would localized differences in the living substance be brought about to a suflficient extent to lead to differences between the daughter-cells produced by fission, as a consequence of the imperfections of the process of cell-division. The differences produced in this way might be changes in the nucleo-cytoplasmic balance, as Hertwig supposes, or in the relative proportions of substances exertmg different physiological activities, as suggested by Biitschli, Geddes and Thomson, Schaudimi and Doflein, or possibly of all these and other changes yet unknown. In any case it is reasonable to suppose that the imperfect character of the primitive types of cell-division, described in the last chapter, might produce accumulated material or structural inequalities in the daughter-cells, such as could- only be rectified by the union of two cells differentiated in opposite directions, thus making syngamy a necessity for the continued existence of the species. This theory explains the necessity for syngamy recurring with greater frequency in forms havmg a high degree of structural differentiation than m forms of a primitive and simple type of organization. With increasing perfection in the process of the division of the cell, and especially of the nucleus, the primary cause of, or necessity tor, syngamy might be expected to disappear ; but at this stage in evolution other benefits to the species consequent on the process of amphimixis might be a sufficient cause for the retention of a process already well established. This conclusion appears to receive some support from the fact that intensive culture, whether artificial, or natural as m parasitism, seems to dimhiish the necessity for syngamy.

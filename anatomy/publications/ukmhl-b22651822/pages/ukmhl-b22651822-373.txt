The gregarines and coccidia 353 Legor proceeds to divide the two sections further by the number of sporozoites produced in the oocyst, but we venture to doubt if this is a method of classi- fication which is natural. In the section Adeleidea, Leger includes the hsemo- gregarines as a family, Hcemogregarinidce, characterized by producing one octozoic spore; but this is true only of two species, so far as is known at present, and certainly not of many others (see p. 378, infra). There remains for mention the family Aggregatidoe, comprising certain organisms, generally regarded as coccidia, parasitic upon Cophalopods of various genera {Sepia, Medone, Ociopiis, etc.). These parasites fall into numerous species, of which Moroff (94) enumerates. twenty-one, but thoy are comprised in a single genus which has gone tln-ough many vicissitudes of nomenclature, having figured at different times under the names Benedenia, Legeria, Legerina, and Eucoccidium; but when it had, apparently, settled down under the last of these names, it was discovered that the schizogony, formerly supposed to be absent in this genus of parasites, occurs in a distinct host—namely, a crab—where it had been seen by Frenzel and named by him Aggregata ; this name stands, therefore, as the " correct " name of this genus of parasites. Not less debatable than the name of these parasites is their systematic position. While, up to a comparatively recent time, their schizogonous phases in crabs had been regarded as those of coelomic gregarines, their sporogonous cycle in Cephalopods was accepted as that of a coccidian. Siedlecki (652) investigated the sexual phases, and foimd a type of sporogony quite m accordance with that of coccidia—namely, sporoats (gametoeytes) separated from one another, the male gametocyte producing a great number of microgametes, one of which fertihzed a macrogamete, with subsequent division of the zygote to form a number of sporoblasts and spores. Recently, however, Moroff published a note in which he maintained that the tertihzation was of a type quite different from that described by Siedlecki. Me asserted that the macrogametocyte gave rise before, not after, fertilization to a number of sporoblasts, and that the sporoblasts in question were the true macrogametes each of which, after being fertilized, gave rise to a smgle spore. In other worcb, Moroff described the fertilization as being of the gregarme-type, and not that characteristic of coccidia.

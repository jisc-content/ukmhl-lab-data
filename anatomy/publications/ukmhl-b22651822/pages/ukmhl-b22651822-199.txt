181 POLYMORPHISM AND LIFE-CYCLES number of amcsbulse which develop into the adult in the usual way (Fig. 80, M—Q). Arcella thus furnishes a surprising example of diversity both in the courses taken by the development and in the methods of syngamy. We may now consider some further complications of the life-cycle, which in other Protozoa takes usually a more definite and stereotyped course, less liable to the variations in one and the same species seen in Arcella. One of the commonest compHcations introduced into the hfe- cycles of Protozoa is the differentiation of sexual and non-sexual cycles. In the account given above of the life-cycle of Arcella, it has been seen that an adult may produce amoebulae which as agametes can grow up directly into the adult form without syngamy, or which as gametes copulate before developing further. The adult Arcellce, however, do not, so far as is Imown, exhibit any differentiation in relation to these developmental differences, the form that produces gametes being perfectly similar to that which produces agametes. But in other cases there may be two distinct forms of the adult individuals : the one, laiown as the sporont or gamont, which gives rise to gametes ; the other, termed the schizont or agamont, which produces agametes.* In this way an alternation of generations is brought about in which the life-cycle as a whole becomes a combination of two distinct types of developmental cycle —one known as schizogony, in which no sexual processes occur ; the other as sporogony, in which at one stage gamete-formation is followed by syngamy. An example of alternation of generations in a free-living form is seen in the life-cycle of Trichosphcerium (Fig. 81), as described by Schaudinn (146). The adult phase is a relatively large amoeboid form, approximately spherical in contour, and having the body surrounded by a gelatinous envelope in which at intervals there are apertures through which the lobose pseudopodia are extruded ; the " Ui^l-T^^'^ZTT^ ^ modification suggested by Butschli for the term fn^^na nl,'.

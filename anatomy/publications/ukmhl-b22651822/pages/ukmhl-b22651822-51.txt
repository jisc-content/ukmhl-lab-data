35 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PROTOZOA in the case of Difflugia the foreign particles used are taken up by the pseudopodia during the process of being retracted ; the surface of the pseudopodium then becomes wrinkled, and particles of debris are caught in these \n-inkles, and so drawn into the interior of the protoplasmic body, in which they are stored up in the fundus of the shell, like the plates in Euglypha, and are utilized in the growth of the shell, or in repairing damages to it, or in building a new shell when the animal reproduces itself by division. -Fig. 17.â€”Haliphysema iumanowiczii, a foraminifer which buikls up its house out of sponge-spicules. A, part of the protopLasm stained to show the nuclei (n.); B, a living specimen with expanded pseudopodia (p.). After Lankester (11). The simplest architectural type of shell or test is a simple spherical or oval capsule, usually with a largo aperture at one pole through which the protoplasm is able to creep out in order to capture food or perform the function of locomotion (Fig. 16). The wall of tlie test may be imperforate, or may have fine pores througJi which also the protoplasm can stream out. With continued growth of the organism, the original shell may become too small for Its requirements. Then the organism may reproduce itself by fission.

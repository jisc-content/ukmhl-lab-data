THE NUCLEUS 81 may be present. It is simplest in theory, and probably correct in fact, to regard the centriole as the primary, in many cases the sole, constituent of the centrosome—an element which may be capable, to a greater or less extent, of changes in size and structure, and which multiplies by division. To the primary centrosome or , .-.■^•t^ti'./j;.. Fig. Sl.—Achnosphoerium eichhorni: formation of the centrosome. A, Concentra- tion of the nuclear reticulum towards one pole of the nucleus, near which n appears free from granulations, forming the archoplasm ; B G,^ I), passage of a portion of the nuclear reticulum to the exterior to form the spongy centrosome " lying in the archoplasm ; B, spongy centrosome with striations passing from it through the archoplasm to the nucleus ; -f, Cx, the centrosome passes back again to the vicinity of the nucleus and undergoes a reduction of substance—the archoplasm also diminishes tem- porarily in quantity ; H, division of the centrosome. After Hertwig (64). centriole there may be added adventitious elements of protoplasmic or nuclear origin, thus forming a centrosomic complex which may attain a size relatively considerable in some cases. So far the centrosome has been discussed only in its relation to 6

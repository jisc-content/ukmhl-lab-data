356 CHAPTER XV THE SPOROZOA : II. THE HiEMOSPORIDIA In the order Hsemosporidia are comprised a number of organisms characterized by the following peculiarities : They are parasites of the blood-corpuscles, red or white, of vertebrates during a part of the life-cycle ; like the Coccidia, they exhibit an alternation of generations, non-sexual schizogony and sexual sporogony ; and, m all cases thoroughly investigated up to the present, the alternation of generations corresponds to an alternation of hosts, the schizogony taking place in the blood or internal organs of a vertebrate, the sporogony in the digestive tract or other organs of an invertebrate ; lastly, resistant spores are not, as a rule, produced in this order, being rendered unnecessary by the fact that the parasite is never, so to speak, in the open, but always sheltered within the body of one or the other of its two hosts during its entire life-cycle. The Hcemosporidia, as the name is generally understood, are a group which comprises a number of forms differing considerably amongst themselves. Some of the types referred at present to this order will, perhaps, when thoroughly investigated, be removed from the order altogether. The existence of these dubious forms renders the precise limits of the group uncertain and ill-defined. All that can be said at present is that the order contauis a nucleus of true Hiemosporidia presenting very obvious and close affinities with the Coccidia, and, in addition to such forms, certain others, the true affinities of which remain to be determined, but which can be ranked provisionally in the group. Under these circumstances, the occasion is not yet ripe for treatmg the c^roup in a comprehensive manner, as has been done with Gregtrines and Coccidia. The difficulty of dealing with these blood-parasites is enhanced by the fact that there is perhaps no crroup in the animal kingdom in which the nomenclature-purist has wrought such havoc as in the Heemosporidia. Matters have reached such a pitch that in some cases the popular names of certam forms are more distinctive than their strictly scientific appellations, so that the very raison d'etre of a scientific termmology has been stultified.

27 THE MODES OF LIFE OF THE PROTOZOA A further point of great interest in this connection is that T. hrucii in Africa appears, from the observations of Bruce, to occur as a natural parasite of Avild game, and to be as harmless to these its natural hosts as T. lewisi is to rats. The physiological difference between these two species is that T. lewisi is perfectly specific to its natural host, whereas T. hrucii is capable of flounsh- ing in others, with most deadly effects. Hence the pathogenic properties of T. hrucii would appear to be exerted on hosts to which Fro. 12.—Trypanosomes of the Irucii-gvoxcp.

The pathogenic properties of T. hrucii, and doubtless of other similar forms, may from this point of view be characterized as a disharmony associated with the first steps in the origin of species. The problem of the origin of diseases caused by parasites is essentially a problem of the same nature as the origin of species. The first step in the formation of new species is a process of varia- tion in an established species. Similarly, in the process of forma-

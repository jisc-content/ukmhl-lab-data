6 THE PROTOZOA result of degeneration aiid specialization. These organisms do not conform to the type of structm-e of the cell, as this word is usually understood, since they do not exhibit, speaking generally, a division of the living body substance into a nucleus distinct from the cytoplasm ;* but the cliromatin is distributed through the proto- plasmic body in the condition of scattered lumps or granules (" clu'omidia "), and in many cases it constitutes, apparently, the whole or a very large proportion of the substance of the body. A B j'jQ. 2.â€”Amwha proteus. A, An individual in active movement; the arrows indicate the direction of the currents in the protoplasm ; at r is seen a pseudo- podium which is nearly completely retracted and has assumed a miilberry- like apj)earance ; c.v., contractile vacuole ; /., faecal matter extruded at the end of the body posterior in movement; the nucleus is obscured by the opacity of the protoplasm. B, An individual in the act of capturing its prey (Pi), an Infusorian {Urocentrum) ; two pseudopodia have flowed round it, as shown by the arrows, and met at the point c, enclosing the prey ; another Infusorian (P^) is seen in a food vacuole in the body ; N., nucleus ; other letters as in ^. After Leidy (226), magnified 200 diameters. Further, the body in organisms of the bacterial type is of definite form, limited in many cases by a rigid envelope or cuticle, and special organs of locomotion are either absent or present in the form of so-called " flagella," structures perhaps different in natm-e from the flagella of truly cellular organisms. But the most remark- able and significant feature of organisms of the bacterial type is seen in the many different modes of metabolism and assimilation * The significance of the terms " nucleus," " cytoplasm," " chromidia," etc., w ill be explained more fully in subsequent chapters.

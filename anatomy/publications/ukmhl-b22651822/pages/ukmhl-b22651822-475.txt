THE INTTJSORIA 445 spiral of Vorticellids are formed each by the concrescence of three rows of cilia (Fig. 186, K, u.m.); in Glaucoma scintillans there is a " peroral" mem- brane built up of five rows, an " endoral " membrane of ten rows of fused cilia (Maier, 73). The membranellre of the adoral zone are formed each by the concrescence of two transverse rows of cilia (Fig. 186, O, ml.). In some genera (Sfentor, Spirostomum) the basal rim of each membranella is continued down into the endoplasm in the form of a fibrillar plate, triangular in form, with the apex continued into a terminal filament, which is attached at its proximal ex- tremity to a fibril running longitudinally, parallel to the row of membranellte. The nature of this basal fibril has been much discussed ; it has been regarded as a nervous element, co-cordinating the movements of the membranelte ; Maier, on the other hand, regards the basal lamella and its terminal filament as serving for the firmer attachment of the membranellse, and considers the basal fibril to be a contractile ele'ment; Schroder states that the basal fibril is really a broad band, and believes its function to be purely mechanical; Schuberg rejects the nervous theory of the basal system of the adoral zone of Stentor, but comes only to negative conclusions with regard to its function. The cirri of the Hypotricha are formed by concrescence of a tuft of cilia arising from a number of basal granules which are arranged to form a basal plate (Fig. 186, H, C). The posterior ciliary ring of Vorticellids is composed of " membranulse " (Maier), each formed by concrescence of a single row of cilia, three in each row. The two circlets of Didinium are also membranulse (Then). Closely connected with the bases of the cilia in position, and with the ciliary apparatus in their general arrangement, are the myonemes. The most superficial study of the Ciliata suffices to convince the observer that these animals have in many cases an extremely efficient contractile system. Such forms as Stentor, Vorticella, etc., contract with such lightning rapidity that it is almost impossible to kiU and preserve them expanded ; the spasmodic action of their contractile organs contrasts sharply with the slow contractility of lower Metazoa, such as polyps. Trachdocerca, according to Lebedew (93), contracts in an instant to one-twelfth of its length when expanded. In thek primitive arrangement the myonemes run parallel to the rows of cilia, immediately beneath the basal granules or close beside them (Fig. 186, B, m.). In Stentor the myonemes are broad and band-like, and composed of altematmg light and dark portions (Fig. 186, J); they are lodged in canals below the alveolar layer, running in the intervals between the " ribs " or pigmented strips of the body-surface ; the rows of cilia run above each myoneme-canal, slightly to the side of it (Fig. 186, /). The myonemes run the length of the body, from the foot to the adoral zone of membranella. At the extremity of the foot they bend inwards and form a cone or " foot- FiG. 186 continued: from a number of basal granules in a row forming the basal rim (h.r.) ■ below the basal nm IS the basal lamella (b.l), continued at its apex into the end- fibnl (e./.) which passes down to the basal fibril (6./.). seen cut in transverse section : Z, zoochlorella ; H. part of a section of the body of StylonycUa hiatrio, showing two tactile cilia {t.c.) on the dorsal surface, and on the ventral surface two cirn (0.) each composed of a fused tuft of cilia arising from a basal plate of granules ; /, section of the body-surface of Sfentor ccemleus. showin^r menf^d^' HWw'"^^^^^^^^ (^.m.) lodged in canals (cm.) between the pig° nf t.t " ' ^ ' «f *he longitudinal mvonemis oi Stentor,n surface view, showing the alternating light Ind dark portions ; detail from a longitudinal section of Evistylis plicatilis. showing the two undulating membmnes (u.m.) of the peristome in transverse section each composed of three fused cilia arising from three basal granules 2 ^)'fused together ; from each basal plate arises a fibril; the two fibrils jo^^ ind become toteSl"*'' °' longitudinal myonemes nmning^dow^ the bo^y AfKif!:^s^^:rtii^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^ •^■>f'- S^'^^^'i-

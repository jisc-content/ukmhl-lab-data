THE PROTOZOA 444 Fig. 186.â€”Details of the structure of the ciliary and contractile apparatus of Ciliata. A, Two isolated cilia of Stentor cosrvleus, showing the deeply-stained proximal portion, of even thickness throughout, and the lighter distal portion, tapering to a point ; magnified 2,250 diameters ; B, section through the surface of the body of Prorodon teres, showing the cilia arising from basal granules (b.g.), situated above canals {cm..}, at the base of which run the myonemes (in.), seen in transverse section ; C, section through the mouth of Prorodoii teres (Fig. 14), showing the rod-apparatus (i?.), each rod with two myonemes (m.r., m.r.^); N., nucleus ; D, section of the body-surface of Paramecium caudatum, showing the cilia arising from basal grains : T., trichocysts ; f.v., food-vacuole ; E, section through the mouth and oesophagus of Paramedum caudaturn, showing the undulating membrane (u.m.) in the oesophagus: other letters as in D ; F, section through the adoral zone of Nydothcrus cordiformis, showing the membranellce {ml.) cut across, each composed of two cilia arising from a pair of basal granules ; G, section of the adoral zone of Stentor niger, showing a membranella {ml.), composed of fused ciha arismg [Continued at foot of p. 445.

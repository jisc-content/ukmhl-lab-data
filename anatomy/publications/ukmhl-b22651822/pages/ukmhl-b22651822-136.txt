B, Pseudopodia withdrawn; nucleus in the spiieme-stage ; central grain dividing. G, Division of the central grain further advanced ; nucleus showing distinct chromosomes. D, Central grain completely divided into centrosomes, between which the nucleus is placed ; in the nucleus tlic membrane is becoming dissolved, the reticulum is becoming modifaod in arrangement to form the achromatin^c spindle (or a part of it), and the chromo- somes arc taking up their position in the equatorial plate.

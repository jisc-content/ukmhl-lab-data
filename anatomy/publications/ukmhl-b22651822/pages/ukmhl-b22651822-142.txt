124 THE PROTOZOA lata, on the other hand, the division of the body is usually longi- tudmal. In any case, the two products of fission may be equal or subequal m size, without perceptible difEerence of parent and young ; or they may be markedly unequal, in which case parent and offspring can be distinguished clearly. The various organs of the body may be doubled before division : either by splitting or new growth of one set; or, if there are many organs of a particular kind present, such as the cilia and tricho- cysts of Ciliata, they may be simply shared between the two daughter-organisms ; or, finally, any given organ present in the animal before division may be retained by one of the two daughter- individuals, while the other forms the organ in question anew after division. Thus, in Ciliata one daughter-individual retains the old peristome; the other forms a new one for itself. The greater the number of organs formed afresh in the daughter-mdividual, the more advanced is the transition from ordinary fission towards budding. In typical gemmation small portions of the parent-organism grow out, into which pass either nuclei, the products of the division of the parent-nucleus (Fig. 68), or of budding from the nucleus of the parent (Fig. 55), or chromidia, al one or together with a nucleus. Such buds may arise on the surface of the parent-body, or they may be cut off in the interior of the cytoplasm of the parent, and may remain for some time within its body. Endogenous budding of this kind is seen in the Neosporidia (p. 325), in the Acinetaria, where it is combined with nuclear buddmg, and in Arcella (Fig. 80) and some amoebfe, where it is combined with formation of secondary nuclei from chromidia.

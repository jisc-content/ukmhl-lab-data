THE MODES OF LIFE OF THE PROTOZOA 15 the Flagellata, where a given species may be either holozoic or holophytic,* according to circumstances. The bionomics of Protozoa—that is to say, their relations to their environment and to other organisms—constitute a very important branch of knowledge, both practical and theoretical, especially in the case of parasitic forms. Considering the subject from the point of view of the four modes of life already described, it is clear, in the first place, that the holophytic forms are entirely independent of all other living organisms, and require for their continued existence only sunlight and a suitable environment, containing the necessary inorganic substances, at a temperature which permits the continuance of vital processes and activities. Saprophytic organisms, however, in so far as they require for their sustenance materials produced by living bodies, are dependent directly or indirectly upon other organisms for their existence. Purely holozoic forms, also, cannot exist without other forms of life upon which, or upon the products of which, they can feed. But neither holozoic nor saprophytic organisms are dependent, as a rule, upon any other particular form of life, but only upon living things generally ; though in some cases such forms may be specialized in their nutrition to such an extent as to be unable to exist without some particular food. A parasitic form, on the other hand, is entirely dependent, as a rule, for its existence on some particular organism or limited group of organisms which constitute its host or hosts. It must, however, be understood clearly that an organism living in or upon the body of another organism is not necessarily a parasite by any means. In the first place, a distinction must be drawn between parasitism and symbiosis, by which is meant an association of two organisms for mutual benefit.j Good examples of symbiosis are seen in some of the Sarcodina, Radiolaria, and Foraminifera, the proto- plasm of which contains constantly intrusive organisms, known as zoocMorellce or zooxanthellce, according as they contain a green or a yellow pigment. Zoochlorellse are green algae of the order Proto- coccacece; zooxanthellse are holophytic flagellates of the suborder Cryptomonadma—e.(/., Cryptomonas schaudinni, symbiotic in the foraminifer Peneroplis (Winter, 28). These organisms penetrate * For example, the species GAromzi/ma ^amcaws.

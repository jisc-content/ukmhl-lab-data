462 CHAPTER XVIII AFFINITIES AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAIN SUBDIVISIONS—DOUBTFUL GROUPS In the foregoing chapters the Protozoa have been dealt with systematically, grouped in a somewhat conservative manner under the four old-estabhshed and generally-recognized classes. At the same time it has been pointed out that one class at least-namely the exclusively-parasitic Sporozoa—comprises two subclasses which are quite distinct from one another, and are descended, in all probability, from ancestors diflfermg greatly in characters and aflanities. And in the case of the three remainmg classes, con- sisting mainly of free-living, non-parasitic forms, two which exhibit more primitive characters—namely, the Sarcodina and Mastigophora —are connected with one another by transitional forms which render the distinction between them very arbitrary (p. 213) ; while the third, the highly-speciahzed Infusoria, are linked closely by structural characters and by transitional forms to the Mastigophora. Many authorities on the Protozoa have put forward schemes of classification which are intended to express the affinities and inter- relationships of the chief groups in a clearer and more satisfactory manner than the fourfold classification generally recognized. The systems proposed have taken the form either of subdividing the Protozoa into more than four classes or of uniting the recognized subdivisions into a smaller number of categories. Eolleston and Jackson (15) divide the Protozoa as a whole into three groups: (1) the Rhizopoda (= Sarcodina); (2) the Endoparasita (=Sporozoa); and (3) the Plegepoda, " referring to their mode of progression by means of a rapidly - repeated stroke {irXr^yrj) of vibratile processes," to comprise the Mastigophora and Infusoria. Dofiein (891) recognizes two principal stems in the Protozoan phylum: (1) the Plasmodroma, to include the Sarcodina, Mastigophora, and Sporozoa, organisms that make use of locomotor organs which represent true pseudo- podia, or their derivatives or modifications; and (2) the Ciliophora, comprising the Ciliata and Suctoria, in which the locomotor organellas are cilia. The obvious criticism of this scheme is that, whatever opiiiion may be held as to the desirability of drawing a line between the Infusoria, so highly specialized in many respects, and other Protozoa, the distinctive character chosen is not a happy one, since whatever may be predicated of flageUa as derivatives of pseu- dopodia applies, apparently, with equal force to cilia.

410 THE PROTOZOA Tho clovelopmont oi Sphmtinomyxon (Fig. 170) begins witJi a uninucleate amoebula (Fig 170, A), which represents- the planont phase, and doubtless multiplies by hssion, since these parasites, though rare generally, occur abun- FiG. 170.â€”Stages in the development of Sphceradinomyxon stolci. A, Amoebula with a single nucleus ; B, binucleatc amoebula ; G, the two nuclei of the preceding stage have each dmded, and the body is divided into four cells, two peripheral envelope-cells and two central germinal cells ; D, the space enclosed by the envelope-cells has become greatly enlarged, and the two germinal cells have divided into four; E, the germinal cells have increased in number by repeated division into sixteen, which as gametes are copulating in eight pairs ; F, 0, two stages in the fusion of two gametes ; H, the zygote has divided into two cells ; in one of these (on the left), which will form the germinal mass of the spore, the nucleus is at this stage undivided; in the other (on the right), which will form the accessory structures of the spore, the nucleus has divided to form six nuclei; /, further stage of the preceding; in the germinal cell (on the left) the nucleus has divided into several nuclei of unequal sizes; the sporal tissue (on the right) is represented by six cells, three peripheral, the parietal cells, and three central, the capsulogenous cells ; J, ripe spore, enclosed by a sporocyst composed of three valves meeting in sutures ; the germinal mass (g.). separate in the preceding stage, has migrated into the interior of the spore, and contains an immense number of nuclei; at the upper pole of the spore are seen the three polar capsules {p-c).

The planont phase is succeeded by a binu- cleate stage (Fig. 170, B), the origin of which is uncertain, but which most probably arises from an association and plastogamic fusion of two planonts, and which represents the spore-forming phase.

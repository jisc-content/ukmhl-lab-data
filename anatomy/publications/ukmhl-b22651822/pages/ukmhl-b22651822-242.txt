THE PROTOZOA 224 reSn? .n.? kmd, which occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and is the pathogenic agent of amoebic dysentery and liver-abscoss : t attacks and devours the tissues of the host, destroying the wall of the intestine, whence it penetrates into the blood-vessels and is carried to the liver, where it establishes itself and gives rise to liver-abscesses. These two species ot amcebse are distinguishable by structural characters. E. coli has a relatively fluid body, with ectoplasm feebly developed and with a fairly large spherical nucleus (or nuclei) lodged in the endoplasm. E. histolytica ■n Fig. 89.—Entamoeba coli.

After Casagrandi and Barbagallo. on the contrary, has a relatively viscid body with greatly-developed ecto- plasm, as is seen clearly in the formation of pseudopodia, which may consist entirely of ectoplasm ; it is smaller than E. coli, and its nucleus has a com- pressed form, stains feebly, and is lodged in, or immediately below, the superficial ectoplasmic layer. The life-cycles of these two species are also very different, as described by Schaudinn. ,r u- E. coli, ill the amoeboid multiplicative phase, reproduces itself by binary

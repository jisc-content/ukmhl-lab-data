298 THE PROTOZOA undergo the principal phase of their cycle. In the development of the trypanosomes of fresh-water fish in the leech Hemiclepsis the parasites do not pass farther back than the crop (Robertson, 603). l^mally, ni the many species of pathogenic trypanosomes which are transmitted by tsetse-flies of various species, two types of develop- mental cycle can be distinguished : in the one, the parasite invades Fia. 129.â€”Trypanosoma granidosum of the common eel: four different sizes, probably stages of growth. After Minchin (478), x 2,000. the whole alimentary canal of the fly ; in the other it undergoes the greater part of its development in the proboscis and pharynx alone. The details of the developmental cycle in the invertebrate host are very inadequately known, and have only been studied in a very few instances. As a rule the characteristic form of this part of the life-history is a crithidial or trypanomonad type, repre-

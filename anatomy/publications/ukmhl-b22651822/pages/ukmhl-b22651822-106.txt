88 THE PROTOZOA form two or more grains when there are numerous flagella. Thus, in Lopho7nona% Avhich shows the extreme of complication, there are numerous basal granules corresponding to the tuft of flagella (Fig. 45). Each basal granule in this case is divided into a proximal Fig. 44.â€”Diagrammatic representation of the possible phylogenetic origin of the different tyi^es of flagellar attachment in flagellates. For the sake of sim- plicity it is supposed that the animal has but a single flagellum. 0", Non- flagellated cell with a centriole in the nucleus ; 0^, in a cell like the last a flagellum arises from the centriole ; condition with a flagellum arisuig close beside the nucleus ; 1'', condition with the blepharoplast quite separate from the nucleus ; 2", division of the single centriole into a definitive centro- some and a blepharoplast, which becomes quite independent (2'') of the nucleus ; 3*, division of both nucleus and centriole to form distinct kinetic and trophic nuclei, each with its own centriole ; the kinetonuclear centriole remains within the nucleus ; 3S the kinetonuclear centriole becomes distinct from the nucleus ; 3"', condition with a single centriole in the cell; 3^ condition with a blepharoplast distinct from the centrioles of the two nuclei. and a distal granule, and the pairs of granules are arranged in a ring, interrupted at one point ; the tuft of flagella takes origin from the distal granules of the ring. When the nucleus divides, the daughter-centrosomes give rise to new rmgs of blepharoplasts,

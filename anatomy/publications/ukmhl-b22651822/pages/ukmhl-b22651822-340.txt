320 THE PROTOZOA Afjimiies and Phylogeny of the HcBmo/lagellales.—Two opposite views have been held with regard to the origin of the Flagellates para- sitic m blood and their aUies : First, that they have a double origin along two distinct lines of descent, some bemg derived from hetero- mastigote, the others from cercomonad ancestors (Woodcock Doflein, Senn) ; secondly, that the HiemoflageUates are closely allied to certain forms hitherto classed as Hfemosporidia (p. 388), and form with them a homogeneous group or order of the FlageUata,' the so-called Binucleata (Hartmann). The question of the Hsemosporidia will be discussed below (p. 389). It is sufficient here to deal with the Htemoflagellates alone. From the general survey of the " forms " or " genera " dealt with in this chapter, it is very evident that Trypanosoma, Grithidia, Leptomonas {Herpetomonas), and Leishmania, are very closely EiG. 141.—A and B, Prowazekia weinbergi, Mathis and Leger (473), magnified 2,400 ; G, Prowazekia parva, Nagler (585), magnified about 2,250. related to one another. Structurally the first three types shade off insensibly into one another, the dividing Ime between Trypano- soma and Grithidia, or between Grithidia and Leptomonas, being quite arbitrary, and far less definite in reahty than it appears when reduced to words ; while Leishmania is a resting non-flagellated phase of any of the three. Developmentally the four types, or any two of them, may occur as phases in the life-history of a single species, so that the selection of a given form as the " adult" in- dividual, by means of which the generic name is to be determmed, is also, in many cases, quite arbitrary. Phylogenetically an evolu- tionary series can be recognized begmning -with Leptomonas, and passing through Grithidia to Trypanosoma, of Avliich the central feature is the gradual development of an undulating membrane, which finally runs the whole length of a more or less sinuous and

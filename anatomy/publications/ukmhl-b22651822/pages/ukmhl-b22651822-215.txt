THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 197 products of metabolism, a primaiy necessity of anaerobic life. The question of size is also a factor, since deleterious substances may diffuse from the surface of the body, and in a small body tJie surface is greater in proportion than in a larger one. Consequently the conditions are more favourable for a smaller species, such as Paramecium, than for a largo form, such as Spirostomum. Excess of oxygen was found by Putter (198) to have an injurious effect on Spirostomum, affecting, however, only the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus, in the first instance. On the current view that the sjonbiotic vegetable organisms present in many Protozoa aid in the respiratory processes by absorbing the carbon dioxide, breaking it up, and setting free the oxygen, the experiments of Lipska (173) on a culture of Paramecia which contamed green algte (Proto- coccacese) in their endoplasm are of considerable interest. In two glass vessels of equal size there were placed, in the one Paramecia with, in the other without, the algse in their body. Hydrogen was circulated tlirough the vessels to di-ive out the air, after which they were hermetically sealed and exposed to the same conditions of light and temperature. After fifty hours the vessels were opened. The Paramecia without algaj were dead, but those contammg algse were stiU alive, though feeble in their movements, and they revived completely in about twenty-four hours after air had access to them. In another experiment two batches of Paramecia were kept in the dark • after eight days those without algse were dead, while those containing alga^ were perfectly normal. Old cultures of Paramecia containing algse showed no conjugation; Lipska explains this as due to the influence of the algaj since, by settmg free oxygen, they prevent the development of anaerobic bacteria which produce substances toxic to the Infusoria According to Popoff (185), the depression-periods of Protozoa (p. 208) are partly due to derangements of the respiratory processes and to accumulation 01 products of metabohsm in the cell. 3. Excretion and Secretion.—The waste substances excreted from the protoplasm may be either soluble or insoluble in nature If soluble, they may either pass out of the protoplasmic body by diffusion from the surface, or may be removed by the agency of the contractile vacuoles. ContractUe vacuoles are of common occurrence in free-living fresh-water Protozoa, but are usuaUy wantmg in marine forms, or, if Jhe^fcurln them differentiatfon (CO "pare kTIsCT o's"?' ^f^' T"^^ ^V"^*"^^^ believed at one time to Pmrvf^r^' V " . ^ contractile vacuoles were as circulatory organs bXhi^nlAr^ ^'^ '^^-^^f y' ^^^^ ^^^^t^^^^ «™Ply fully, it harLTrov'ed th ?thir J" Tu'"^ they have been studied drl Jennings, m, lCZkl m-l^"^ '"^^'^ themselves to the exterior (compare pre^ssSrfmakel t'llf'iZTr^K^^^^^ <i menting with GlaucoC coll7cm^^o^^^^ ^'^T ^'i^^' ^^P^"' increase in the frequencv of thr'nnW f-t produced at first an

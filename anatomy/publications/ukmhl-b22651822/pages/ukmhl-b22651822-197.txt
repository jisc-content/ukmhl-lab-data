POLYMORPHISM AND LIFE-CYCLES 179 the opposite ends of a diameter of the circular body, and an irregular ring of clu-omidia forming a dense chromidial net. Under certain conditions Arcella becomes encysted, forming a spherical cyst with a tough impervious membrane within the shell, closing the mouth of it. The adult Arcella reproduces itself by a variety of methods, Avhich, however, may be reduced to two principal types : binary fission, producing daughter-individuals (Arcellce) of approximately equal size ; and gemmation, producing small amoebulse such as have been described above as the starting-point of the ontogeny. The production of the amoebulse may or may not be in relation to syngamy, which, when it occurs, may be of one or the other of two distinct types—karyogamy between amoebulse, or chromidiogamy between adult Arcellce. Binary fission (Fig. 80, B—O) is the ordinary type of reproduction during the " vegetative " life in the summer months, when the animal is actively feeding, growing, and reproducing itself. In the process of binary fission, the two nuclei divide by a form of karyokinesis (Fig. 57, p. 110). A quantity of the body-protoplasm streams out through the mouth of the shell, together with some of the chromidia, and one of the two daughter-nuclei of each pair also passes out of the sheU. The daughter-^rceZ^a thus formed secretes for itself a new sheU, and separates from the parent-individual which retains the old sheU. Thus in binary fission both nuclei and chromidia take part, the former dividing by mitosis, while the latter are subjected to a roughly equal partition. The ordinary binucleate form of Arcella may become multi- FiG. 80~conlinued : ih^l f ^fig'^fes l)elow the level of D represent reproduction by gemmation • those to the left are reproductive processes not combined h =7^ * those on the right show the methods of syngamy '"'"'''''^^ syngamy; from^hrratTas^irX^far^'^^ ^^^^ - ^i'^-ated singly V^renf£^X't:X?:r^^^^ *° P-*«Pl-- of the J, Bud-formation external to the shell • the nrnlnnlnoTr, h^c 4- he^^th°"'^' ^^f'r^ P-«on.:oAtltiS SfpTmarrnS sheH ; the extruded protoplasm producing buds tith fLmat[roftoondai;; the shell and copulate (?) to produi ti; zyX llLbl^/) ^ "'^^ plafnr?v'itMS anl'^ ^^r }, the proto- over into the shell of the other O a^fr ^^t^ ^ nuclei of the one passes protoplasm becomes eTuX distribnt/d h ^ °* ^^'^ chromidii. the Modifiedjrom a diagram by Swarczewsky.

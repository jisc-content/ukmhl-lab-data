THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PROTOZOA 59 fibres, but with chromosomes apparently rudimentary or ab ent Such a spindle is stated to persist and to grow greatly i length, one pole of it finally projecting beyond the anterior end of the body The centrosome at the proximal pole of the spmdle becomes the blephLplast or basal gJanule of the flagellum ; the centrod-^^^^^ itself becomes the flagellum, or at least its axial elastic filament, Fig. 30.—Development of the locomotor apparatus of trypanosomes. ^ A—F, De- velopment of Trypanosoma nocluw: A, the single nucleus of the "ookinete is dividing into two unequal halves ; in each half a centriole is seen, connected -with its twin by a centrodesmose; B, the division of the nucleus complete ; the two sister-nuclei still connected by a centrodesmose uniting the centrioles; C, the smaller nucleus (n.) is dividing unequally to furnish a third nucleus (''.£7-) 5 D, E, the third nucleus is dividing to furnish a proximal and a distal {h.g.~) centriole, while the fibrils of the achromatic spindle become the myo- nemes (mij.);F, development of the trypanosome—iV, trophonucleus; n, kineto- nucleus; 6.7.^, basal granule (true blepharoplast) of the flagellum. In G the pigment (P) present in the earlier stages is being thrown off. After Schau- dinn (132). 0, stage in the development of the mcrozoite of Tri/fanosoma rolalorium into the trypanosome-form; N, trophonucleus, still connected by a cen- trodesmose with M, the kinctonucleus, which has budded off h.g., the basal granule of the flagellum. After Machado (469). the distal centrosome is carried out on the tip of the flagellum ; and the mantle fibres form the myonemes, stated in this case to be eight in number, of the body, which are continued on into the contractile sheath of the flagellum (Fig. 30). However fascinating the views put forward by Schaudinn, with regard to these points, may be, it must be stated that the greatest doubt attaches to the correctness

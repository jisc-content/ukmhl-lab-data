212 CHAPTER XI SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE PROTOZOA: THE SARCODINA As stated in Chapter I., the Protozoa are commonly divided into four principal classes. Of these, two—namely, the Sarcodina and Mastigophora—may be regarded as the more primitive groups, comprising the main stock of less specialized and typical forms from which the other two classes have been evolved. The Sporozoa are an assemblage of exclusively endoparasitic forms exhibiting clearly the modifications and adaptations induced by, or necessary for, their particular mode of life ; and it is practically certain that the Sporozoa are not a homogeneous class showing mutual affinities based upon a common ancestry, but that one section of the group is a specialized offshoot of the Mastigophora, the other of the Sarcodina, and that the two sections are united only by characters of convergence due to the influence of a similar mode of life. The Infusoria, on the other hand, are a specialized group in which great complexity of organization has been attained ; they are the highest class of the Protozoa, and furnish examples of the most extreme degree of structural differentiation of which a unicellular organism is capable. Wliile there is but little difficulty, as a rule, in defining the classes Sporozoa and Infusoria, or in assigning members of these groups to their proper systematic position, the case is different, very often, when we have to deal with the other two classes. The verbal distinction between them is based chiefly on the use of the word " adult ": Sarcodina are Protozoa which have no permanent organs of locomotion in the adult condition, but move by means of pseudo- podia extruded from the naked protoplasmic body ; Mastigophora, on the other hand, bear organs of locomotion in the form of flagella in the adult condition, whether the protoplasmic body is naked and amoeboid or corticate and of deflnite form. In both classes the youngest stages may be flagellate ; if, in an amoeboid form, the flageUa are retained in the adult, the organism is classed m the Mastigophora ; if lost, in the Sarcodina. The word " adult" when applied to the Metazoa has a meanmg which can be defined clearly, as a rule, by the criterion of sexual

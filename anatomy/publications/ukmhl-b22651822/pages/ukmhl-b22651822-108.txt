THE PROTOZOA 90 of this peculiar structure remains for the present problematical. In the spores of Derbesia, Davis ("Annals of Botany," xxii., pp. 1-20, plates i. and ii.) has described a condition very similar to that of LopJiomonas—namely, a double rmg of blepharoplasts, which, however, fuse together to form a ring of homogeneous appearance. The blepharoplast-grains are given off from the nucleus. Centrosomic bodies may be related, not only to flagella, but also to pseudopodia, especially in those cases in which the pseudopodia Fig. 40.—Actinojilmjs sol, showing the axial filaments of the i^seudopodia centred on the nucleus.

In this group the relationship of the nuclear apparatus to the pseudopodia exhibits two types of arrangement, which are analo- gous to the two arrangements described above m Masligina and Mastigella respectively, and which may be explamed by supposmg that in the one case the kinetic centre lies within, in the other case without, the nucleus itself. Thus, in Actinophrys (Pig. 46) the numerous pseudopodia are all centred on the smgle nucleus, in which the centrosome is contained. A variation of this type is described by Schaudinn (43), in the peculiar multmucleate form

398 CHAPTER XVI THE SPOROZOA : III. THE NEOSPORIDIA A TYPICAL member of the subclass Neosporiclia is a parasite of which the life-cycle is initiated by the hberation from the spore of one or more amoebulae within the body of the host, in the digestive tract in all known cases. For this initial amcebula-phase Stempell's term, planont {i.e., " wanderer "), may be employed conveniently, since in no case does it remain in the lumen of the digestive tract, but penetrates into the wall of the gut, and m most cases migrates thence into some organ or tissue of the host, where it lives and multiplies actively, bemg usually at this stage an intracellular parasite, in some cases, however, occurring free in the blood or lymph. The planont-phase is succeeded typically by a plasmodial phase, which arises in some cases by simple growth of the amoebula (probably then a zygote), accompanied by multiplication of its nuclei; in other cases by association together and cytoplasmic fusion of at least two distinct amoebulae, of which the nuclei remain separate. The plasmodial stage is very characteristic of this sub- class ; it represents the principal or " adult" trophic phase of the parasite, and is also the spore-formmg phase ; and, as the name Neosporidia implies, the production of spores begins, as a rule, when the plasmodium is still young, and continues during its growth. In some cases, however, no plasmodium is formed, but the planont-phase is succeeded by uninucleate " meronts " or schizonts, which multiply by fission and give rise ultimately to sporonts in which spore-formation sets a limit to the growth. In such forms the general course of the life-cycle is not essentially different in any way from that of a member of the Telosporidia, such as Coc- cidium. The tendency, therefore, of many Neosporidia to form spores during the trophic phase cannot be used to frame a rigorously- exact definition of the group. A more distinctive characteristic of the subclass is the complete absence of flagellated phases in any part of the life-cycle, and more especially the fact that

FiQ. 102.—Wagnerella borealis, showing budding and fission. A, Specimen with a single bud (&): e.g., central grain ; B, specimen with four buds (6); G, en- larged view of the head of a specimen containing two buds (b) in process of extrusion; D, specimen in which the head has multiplied by fission to produce a Rhaphidiophrijs-like colony; six individuals are seen, five of them eacli with nucleus and central grain, the sixth in process of fission, with two nuclei and two central grains. After Zuelzer (86), The Heliozoa are classified into four suborders : Suborder I.: Aphrothoraca.—Body naked in the active state; envelopes, sometimes with aiUceous spicules, only formed during

THE REPRODUCTION OF THE PROTOZOA 111 figure may be produced, as in Euglypha (Figs. 59, 60), only differing from that of Metazoa in that the whole mitosis takes place withni the nuclear membrane, and consequently without any co-operation of cytoplasmic elements. Chatton proposes for a mitosis of this type the term " mesomitosis," as distinguished from the more ad- vanced type, or " metamitosis," in which a collaboration of cyto- plasmic and nuclear elements is effected, and the entire karyokmetic mmmm Fig. 58.â€”Division of Hcematococcus pluvialis. A, Resting condition, the nucleus with a conspicuous karyosome and fine grains of chromatin in an achromatin'c reti- culum ; B, G, preparations for nuclear division, the chromatin jDassing from the karyosome into the nuclear reticulum; D, further stage, the kaiyosome in disruption and chromosomes beginning to bo formed; E, nuclear spindle ; F, division of the nucleus comjDlete, the karyosomes reconstituted in the daughter-nuclei, the cell-body beginning to divide; G, division of the cell, the daughter-nuclei of the normal resting type. After Reichenow (97-5). figure lies free in the cytoplasm after disappearance of the nuclear membrane. Before passing on, however, to this more advanced type, account must be taken of the more simple types of mitosis seen in granular nuclei. Instructive examples of the division of nuclei, in which the chromatin is not concentrated into a karyosome, but distributed evenly throughout the achromatinic framework, are seen in the nuclei

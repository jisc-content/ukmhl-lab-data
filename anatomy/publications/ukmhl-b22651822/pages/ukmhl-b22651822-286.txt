266 THE PROTOZOA generations—namely, the monad form, product of syngamy, and the adult, mastigamcsba-form, which ultimately produces the monad-like gametes. Hence the life-cycle in such a type is an alternation of generations (metagenesis), which, as in so many other Fig 112.—Life-cycle of Mastigella vitrea, diagrammatic. 1, 2, and 3 Different forms assumed by the adult " vegetative " type of individual; 3a, 2b, repro- duction by binaiy fission; 4—10, gamete - formation ; a (in each case) microsamete-formation, b. macrogamete-formation ; in the former the gamont becomes encysted, and the principal nucleus degenerates early in the process ; in the latter the gamont remains motile and the prmcipal nucleus persists to the last: 4—6, extrusion of chromidia from the nucleus and formation of secondary nuclei ; 7, 8, formation of the gametes round the secondary nuclei ; 9, extrusion of the gametes ; IQa, the small, non-flage lated micio- gametes; 106, the larger, flageUated macrogametes ; 11, «0P'f^^t;°" °J * ° gametes 12, 12a, 12&, multiplication by bmary fission of the mon-^™ fygote ; 13, 14, growth of the monad-form, after a period of multiplication, into the adult mastigamceba-form.

233 THE SARCODINA in some individuals, hence termed microspheric, the initial chamber of the shell is smaller than in others, which are known as megalospheric. This point ^vill be discussed further under the reproduction. It may be noted that if, in this order, a species were to forni no shell, whether from having secondarily lost the habit or as a primi- tive form which had never acquired it, then such a species would be classed in the order Amoebaea Reticulosa. It is very probable that many of the large marme " Proteomyxa " are allied to the true Fia. M.â€”Biloctdina depressa: transverse sections of (a) the megalospheric form, magnified 50 diameters, and (&) the microspheric form, magnified 90 diameters. After Schlumberger, from Lister. Toraminifera, as forms either primitively or secondarily without a test; and Rhumbler unites the Foraminif era proper with the naked forms in the section Reticulosa. The body-protoplasm exhibits no marked distinction of ecto- plasm and endoplasm. Contractile vacuoles are present in some of the fresh-water genera, but are not found in marine forms. The protoplasm contains metaplastic bodies of various kinds, and may become loaded with fsecal matter in the form of masses of bromi granules, termed by Schaudinn the " stercome " (compare also Awerinzew, 281). Periodically a process of defeecation takes place, whereby the protoplasm is cleared of these accumulations, often as a prelude to the formation of a new chamber (Winter, 28). The

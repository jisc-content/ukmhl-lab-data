THE GENEEAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 187 ]. Nutrition and Assimilation.—Living organisms, considered generally, exhibit a great variety of methods of nutrition, which may bo classified into two main groups ; bearing in mind, however, that in aU classifications of living beings, or of their vital properties, any groups or classes that can be distinguished are always connected by gradual and imperceptible transitions, and that consequently forms will present themselves which, owing either to their transi- tional nature or to the imperfect state of our knowledge concerning them, can only be assigned to one or the other group in a manner as arbitrary as the statement that the 21st of June is the first day of summer—a difiiculty which in no way invahdates the distinction between spring and summer. In the first place, many organisms can build up the complex protein-substances, of which the living protoplasm is composed, from simpler chemical materials. Of this type there are found among Protozoa, as already stated, two types of nutrition : first, the holo'plnjtiG, or plant-like, in which the organism is able, by means of special cell-organs, to utiMze the energy of the sunlight in order to synthesize its body-substance from the simplest chemical materials, such as water, carbon dioxide, and mineral salts, through a series of substances in an ascending scale of chemical complexity; secondly, the saprophytic type, in which the body contains no visible organs subserving the function of nutrition, but the organism is able to build up its protoplasm from food-materials consisting of organic substances in solution which are far less complex chemically than the body-proteins. In the second place, many organisms cannot build up their body- substance from materials of simpler chemical constitution, but are entn-ely dependent on a supply of protein-substance ready -made, which they obtain either by ingesting and digesting other Hving organisms m the holozoic method, or by Hving as parasites at the expense of other creatures. These two methods graduate into one another, since many parasites simply devour portions of the bodies ot their hosts m a holozoic manner, but the majority of parasites absorb fluid nutriment from their hosts in an osmotic manner • Hence it is convenient to distinguish holozoic and osmotic parasites'. Considering these various methods of nutrition, it is seen that Irom the pomt of view of the nature of the food, those which ingest It 1 ^""^ ^^l^f^' ^^'^^^'^^^ be distinguished from those which absorb then- food in a diffused or dissolved condition (holo- phytic and saprophytic forms and osmotic parasites). From the pomt of view of the structure of the organism, those which possess special organs of nutrition (holozoic and holophytic forms) can be

The free forms are rounded o^ spindle-shaped; the intracorpuscular parasites may be also of these two forms, but are more often pear-shaped.

(753), who regard the paraSe as a true Piroplasma. Neumann (745) states that in the balmite (Pf^^ vesverhUonis) the parasites midergo a transformation into flageUated organisms and considers Achromahcus alhed to trypanosomes. It is not improbabS that stages ot AchrormiUcus, both in the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts! have been confused with stages of the trypanosome found in the blood of the same vertebrate hosts. .3''/r'ff ""l^lJ'^'^'^^J'Pi'^Vlasnm^m^^^ (Fig. 161) has been studied in great detail by Nuttall and Graham-Smith (748), and by Christophers (732). The small rounded forms divide by simple binary fission of the ordinary type In the larger forms the division takes place in a peculiar manner, more akin to gemniation than to ordinary fission. Before division the parasites become amoeboid and irregular in form, and the nucleus has the form of a compact mass. The nucleus then sends out two buds which grow towards the surface of the body, and at this point two protoplasmic buds grow out into which the nuclear buds pass. The buds increase in size until they become two pear- shaped piroplasms, joined at their pointed ends by the continuaUy-diminishing remains of the body of the original parent-individual. The comiectinc^ mass dwindles to a mere point, and finally the two daughter-individuals separate. A modification of this method leads to the quadruple fission producing four buds and four daughter-mdividuals, as in Babesia mutans.

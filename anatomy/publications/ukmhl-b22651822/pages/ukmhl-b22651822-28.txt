THE PROTOZOA 12 are Amoeba (Fig. 2), Difflufjia (Fig. 16), AclinosphcBrium (Fig. 3), etc. Class II., Mastigophora.*—Protozoa in which the organs of locomotion and food-capture in the adult are flagella, slender fila- ments which are capable of performing active whip-Uke, lashing movements. The body-protoplasm may be naked or corticate. Examples are Euglena (Fig. 4), Trichomonas (Fig. 5), Trypanosoma (Fig. 6), etc. Class III., Sporozoa.—Protozoa occurring always as parasites of other organisms, and without definite organs for locomotion or ingestion of food in the adult condition. The reproduction takes place, typically, by formation of resistant seed-like bodies, termed spores, containing one or more minute germs, termed sporozoites. Examples are Gregarina (Fig. 7), Coccidium (Fig. 152), the malarial parasites (Fig. 156), etc. Class IV., Infusoria.—Protozoa in which the organs of loco- motion and food-capture- are cilia, small vibratile filaments dis- tinguished from flagella by their smaller size, by differences in their mode of movement, and by being present usually, in primitive forms at least, in great numbers like a fine fur over the whole or a part of the surface of the body. The cilia may be present tlxrough- out life (subclass Ciliata), or only in the early stages of the life- history (subclass Acinetaria). The body-protoplasm is always cor- ticate. Examples are Stentor (Fig. 8), Nyctotherus (Fig. 9), Acinela (Fig. 10), etc. Bibliography.—For a list of general works on Protozoa, see p. 476. • * Derived from the Greek juao-ri^, a whip, equivalent to the Latin flagellum.

As a rule, only the proximal portion of the flagellum is uavolved in the formation of Fig. 27.â€”Pleuronema chrysalis.

After SchewiakofF, magnified 660 diameters. the undulating membrane, and the distal portion projects freely beyond it; but in some cases a distal free portion of the flagellum may be quite absent, and then flagellum and undulating membrane are co-extensive (Fig. 12, J). Undulating membranes in Flagellata appear to be specially related to the endoparasitic mode of life, and in free-living species they are found rarely, if ever ; they may be regarded as an adaptation to life in a broth-like medium, such as the intestinal contents, or the blood of a vertebrate, containing many suspended particles or corpuscles. In such cases the membrane may assist the organism to force its way between the solid bodies suspended in the fluid medium. Undulating membranes may, how-

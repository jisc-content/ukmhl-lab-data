THE PROTOZOA 316 V. The Genus LEisHMANrA. This genus was founded by Ross to include two human parasites • the so-called Leishman-Donovan bodies, cause of tlie disease known in India as "Kala-azar" ; and Wright's bodies {L. tropica) cause of boils known by various local names, but termed compre- hensively " Oriental sore." To these a third specics-namely L. infantum—has been added by Nicolle (570), causing a disease in children ni Tunis, Algeria, and Italy, and foimd also in dogs, which are regarded by Nicolle as the primary host of the parasite and the source of the infection in human beings. In all cases the type of parasite found in the vertebrate host is very uniform (Fig. 138)— small bodies, usually rounded or oval, contained within ceUs and Fia. 138.—Leishmania donovani in cells.

Each parasite possesses two distinct nuclear bodies, which the development shows to be a tropho- nucleus and a kuietonucleus respectively. The cells which harbour the parasite are mainly, if not exclusively, of two classes—namely, leucocytes and endothelial cells ; the latter become greatly hyper- trophied, forming the so-called " macrophages " (Fig. 138, A), which may contain 150 to 200 parasites at a time. L. donovani was believed originally to occur also in red blood-corpuscles, and was first described as a species of the genus Piroplasma (p. 379). The balance of evidence, however, is against their occurrence in the hsematids. If set free by the disintegration of their host-cell, they

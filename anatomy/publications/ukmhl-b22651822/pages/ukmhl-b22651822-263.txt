243 THE SARCODINA Suborder 11.: Sorophora (Acrasiae, Pscudoplasmodida). — With no flagellate stage in the life-liistory; the amoebulas do not fuse completely to form a true plasmodiura ; the spores are formed in clusters (" sori "). Here belong various genera, for the most part found in dung, such as Dictyostelium and Copromi/xa. Acrasis occurs in bcer-ycast. In addition to the typical Mycetozoa belonging to these two suborders, there are a number of forms on the border-line, referred by some authorities to the Mycetozoa, by others to other orders, such as the Proteomyxa. It is only possible to refer very briefly to these genera here. In the first place, there are a number of parasitic forms, placed together by Doflem in the suborder Phytomyxinm, Schroter. In this suborder no sporangium is formed, the process of spore-formation being simplified, probably, in correlation with the parasitic mode of life. The typical members of this group are parasites of plants, but some recently-described parasites of msects have been assigned to Phytomyxinoi. The best known example of the group is the common Plasmodiophom brassicce, which attacks the roots of cabbages and other Crucifer£e, producing a disease known as " Fingers and Toes " (" Kohlhernie "), characterized by knotty swellings on the roots. Other genera parasitic on plants are Tetramyxa and Sorosphcera. In Plasmodiophora the spores germinate to produce flagellulse, which are liberated in water or damp earth, and which in some way penetrate into the cells of the plant, and there appear as the myxamoebse after loss of the flagel- lum. The youngest myxamoebae seen have two nuclei. They grow in the cell-contents with multiphcation of their nuclei, and fuse with one another to form plasmodial masses which fill the cell after absorption of its contents. In a diseased plant a number of cells are attacked by the parasite, and it is not certam whether the myxamoebse can pass from one cell to another, and so spread the infection, or whether all the infected cells are derived from the multiphcation of the first cell infected. The second view, mamtained by Nawaschm, is supported by Prowazek, and also by Blomfield and Schwartz with regard to the aUied genus Sorosphcera. ' When the host-cell is exhausted, the reproductive phase begms, accordmg to Prowazek (127), by the nuclei of the plasmodium throwing out numerous chromidia, and becommg m consequence very indistinct. In Sorosphcera at this stage (Blomfield and Schwartz) the nuclei disappear altogether being entu-ely resolved mto chromidia from which secondary nuclei are formed bpore-formation, preceded by sexual processes, takes place in the manner described above (p. 149, Pig. 76). In Sorosphcera, Blomfield and Schwartz louncl that, after reconstitution of the generative nuclei, the Plasmodium divides up into unmucleate cells, each of which divides twice by karyokmesis • after these divisions the cells become arranged as a hoUow sphere, the " soro- were'obseTver ' ^ ov syngamic processes As stated above, certain parasites of insects are referred to this order Lier fnri Hp«^ ^^^/^e genera Sporomyxa, Leger (295), M2jcetosporidium, i^egev and Hesse, and Peltomyces, Leger {G.B.A.S., cxlix., p. 239) Zoomvxa ZtiewZr'' ^''^l' P"^"^^^^ «^ t^'^^^' i« also tobe rSeS ometv& drbtfnl P^'^'T " n?"'^ ^'^^^ considered trt 7bp nffln f the suggestion fSL.lf.v, of PeZtom2/ce5 are rather with the Cnidosporidia (p 409) through the genus Paramyxa recently found by him (761 ^ ^ ArcLl anSSww n- "^^"^^ ^^^i^rkable genera Chlamydomyxa, By Skcstwin t^^^^^^^^ Cienkowski, the affinities of which are still obscure underthe I T f.^^'^V''' independent order of the Sarcodina thev nn ,1 r ^^^^^""thulidea ; by Dolage and Herouard (6) and others ChfZ P ^"'^o'-^er, Filoplasmodida, of the Mycetozoa.

THE PROTOZOA 250 structure of the body, and especially the skeleton, may depart more or less widely from the radiate symmetry wliich is to be regarded, probably, as primitive for the group. Hence three principal types of symmetry can be distinguished in these organisms : (1) Homaxon (Figs. 13, 105, 107), in which all axes passing through the centre are morphologically equivalent, the symmetry of the sphere; (2) monaxon (Fig. 109), in which the body has a principal or vertical axis round which it is radially symmetrical, the type of symmetry of the cone ; (3) bilaterally symmetrical (Fig. 106), in which the body Fig. 105.—Acanthometra dastica, Haeckel. sp., Radiating spinea of the skeleton (twenty in number, but only twelve are seen in the figure) ; ps., pseudopodia ; c, calymma ; c.c, central capsule ; N., N., nuclei ; x, yellow cells ; 7ny., myo- phrisks. After Biitschli, Leuckart and Nitsche's " Zoologische Wandtafeln." can be divided along a principal plane into equivalent right and left halves. With further modification the body may become asymmetrical. Sedentary forms are not known in this group, the species of which are exclusively marine, and occur on the open surfaces of seas and oceans, reaching in many instances a re'atively large size and a very high degree of structural differentiation. In the internal structure, the most salient feature is the division of the body by means of a membranous structure, termed the central capsule (Fig. 13, CK), into a central medullary region and a peripheral cortical zone—hence distinguished as the intracapsular

279 THE MASTIGOPHORA The best known form is the common Noctiluca miliaris of our coasts. The adult Noctiluca is about the size of an ordinary pin's head (1 to 1-5 millimetres in diameter). The spherical body consists chiefly of jelly, with at one pole a superficial concentration of the protoplasm containing the nuclei and giving off. the locomotor organs. From this central mass of protoplasm strands extend in an irregular network through the whole body, which is limited by a thin pellicle. Tlio central protoplasm bears the so-called " peristome," a deep groove containing the mouth-aperture near one end. The mouth is bordered by pro- jections known as the " tooth " and the " lip," and near it arise two motile organs—a small flagellum, and a large tentacle-like process which shows a transversely striated structure and performs twisting and lashing movements. The tentacle is sometimes named the " flagellum," and the true flagellum the " eilium " ; the former probably serves as the organ of locomotion, the latter for food-capture. The nutrition is holozoic. Noctiluca reproduces itself by binary fission, and also by multiple fission producing a brood of small flagellate swarm-spores. The formation of the latter has been stated to be preceded by isogamous conjugation of the adults, but the matter is open to doubt, and it is possible that the swarm-spores them- selves represent the gametes. Other genera of Cystoflagellata are Leptodiscus and Cmspedotella (Kofoid, 373), both remarkable for their superficial resem- blance to medusfe. No tentacle like that of Noctiluca is present in either of these forms, and locomotion is effected by rhythmic contractions of the disc-like body. Bibliography.—For references see p. 486.

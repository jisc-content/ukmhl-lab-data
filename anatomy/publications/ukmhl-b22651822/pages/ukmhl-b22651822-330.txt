THE PROTOZOA 310 former host. T. hdicis, according to Friedrich, passes from one siiail to another mechanically in the spermatophores during coitus Ihe lollowmg account refers mainly to the blood-inhabiting species • The body of a trypanoplasm is relatively broader and shorter' less smuous and serpentine, than that of a trypanosome, and is at the same time softer and more plastic, being limited by an extremely thin periplast. The contractile, often slightly metabolic body yields readily to pressure, and exhibits in consequence passive form-changes when moving among blood-corpuscles or B Fig. 134.—A, Trypanoplasma abramidis from the blood of the bream ; B and 0, T.

The principal structural feature is the possession of two fiagella, which arise close together at the anterior extremity from a pair of blepharoplasts or diplosome, or from a single basal granule (Martin). One flagellum i)rojects freely for- wards ; the other turns more or less abruj)tly backwards, and passes down the side of the body at the edge of an undulating membrane to the hinder end, beyond which it projects freely backwards to a variable extent in different species.

329 THE GREGARINES AND COCCIDIA of the Acephalina, the latter of the Cephalina. In either case, the first effect of the parasite is to produce a hypertrophy, often very great, of tlie cell attacked (Fig. 143, B) ; later, hoAvever, the cell atrophies, dies, and shrivels up (Fig. 143, G). {a) In the Acephalina the intracellular parasite is set free from the cell by its dissolution, and, if lodged in the epithelium of the gut, may pass out of the epithelium either on its inner side, into the lumen of the gut again, or on its outer side, into the bloodvessels or body-cavity, (6) In the Cephalina the relation of the parasite to the host- FiG. 143.â€”Lankesteria ascidice, parasite of Oiona intestinalis.

The sporozoite may merely prick the surface of an epithelial cell with its rostrum {e.g., Pterocephalus), or may dip a short stretch of its anterior end into the ceU {e.g.', Pyxinia), or may penetrate so far that the nuclear region of the parasite is within the ceU {e.g.,8tylor7iynchus), or, finally, may become completely nitracellular {e.g., Stenophora). Ultimately, in all cases the chief mass of the body of the gregarine projects from, or grows out of, the host-ceU mto the cavity of the digestive tract, and becomes the protomerite and deutomerite in septate forms ; the attached

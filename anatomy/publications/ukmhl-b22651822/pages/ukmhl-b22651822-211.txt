THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 193 In the second or alkaline period the vacuole enlarges rapidly to more than its original volume. The red colour produced by staining with neutral-red disappears. The clumped food-mass breaks up into smaller particles again. From the red-staining granules of the first period deeply-staining spheres arise, homogeneous, refractile, and apparently fluid (Nirenstein, 181). According to Khainsky (170-5) the grains or droplets which are formed gather at the surface and pass out into the endoplasm; they represent the first products of the assimilatory process in the vacuole, and their further chemical transformation takes place in the endoplasm itself (compare the refringent bodies formed^ in the process of digestion in acinetans, p. 458). According to Nirenstein, however, thespheres become smaller and smaller, bemg reduced to tiny grains which vanish completely, dissolved in the vacuole-contents. The vacuole now diminishes in size a second time, and passes to the anal region, where it fuses with other similar vacuoles, and is finaUy rejected from the anal pore. In other cases, however, no acid reaction has been demonstrated in the vacuoles at any time, as, for example, in Actinosphcenum—a. pecuHarity which is perhaps to be correlated with the fact that in this form the prey is kiUed when seized by the pseudopodia. It may be supposed that the processes which, in Infusoria, etc., go on during the first or acid period of the food-vacuole, take place in Actino- sphosnum and some other forms before the vacuole is formed in which case the vacuole itseH shows only the second or alkahne phase of the digestion. the^"ecS of ?oirrr."?.^f ^^T"^'"' '^^^ ^"S^^^^^ particles excite tne secretion of acid, but the true digestive vacuole is only foiled under the s nnulus supplied by nutritive matter.

97 THE NUCLEUS nature, which has certain definite relations to the life-history and vital activities of the cell. The word '' nucleus," on the other hand, as many authorities and more recently Dobell (52) have pointed out, is essentially a morphological conception, as of a body, con- tained in the cell, which exhibits a structure and organization of a certain complexity, and in which the essential constituents, the chromatm-particles, are distributed, lodged, and maintained, in the midst of achi-omatinic elements which exhibit an organized arrangement, variable in different species, but more or less constant in the corresponding phases of the same species. If this standpoint be accepted, and the nucleus be regarded as an essentially morpho- logical conception, it seems to me remarkable that Dobell, in his valuable memoir on the cytology of the bacteria, should apply the term " nucleus " to a single grain of chromatin, or to a collection of such grauos, and should speak of a nucleus " in the form of chromidia scattered through the cell," or " in the form of a discrete system of granules (chromidia)," phrases which are self-contra- dictory on the principles that he himself has laid down. We are confronted, nevertheless, with a considerable difficulty when we attempt to state exactly what amount of organization and structural complexity is essential to the morphological concep- tion of a nucleus. If, as is probable in phylogeny, and certainly occurs frequently in ontogeny (compare Fig. 32), the nucleus arises from a primitive chromidial condition of scattered, unorganized chromatin, at what point does the mass cease to be a chromidium and become a nucleus ? This is a question very difficult to answer at present, a verbal and logical difficulty such as occurs in all cases where a distinction has to be drawn between two things which shade oS, the one into the other, by infinite gradations, but which does not, nevertheless, render such distmctions invalid, any more than the gradual transition from spring to summer does away with the distinction between the seasons. Hartmann and liis school consider the possession of a centriole as the criterion of a nucleus (see Nagler, 76) ; but it cannot be considered as established, in the present state of knowledge, that all nuclei have centrioles or centrosomes. All that can be said is that, as soon as a mass or a number of particles of chromatin begin to concentrate and separate themselves from the surroundmg protoplasm, with formation of dLstmct nuclear sap and appearance of achromatinic supporting elements, we have the beginning at least of that definite organiza- tion and structural complexity which is the criterion of a nucleus as distinguished from a chromidial mass. In the first chapter of this book a distinction was drawn between organisms of the "cellular" grade, with distinct nucleus and cytoplasm, and those of the "bacterial" grade, in which the 7

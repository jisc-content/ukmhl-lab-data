93 THE NUCLEUS hardly likely that the basal granules would be of a different nature in the two cases. The whole question of the nature of the basal granules has been discussed in a recent memoir by Erhard (54). Fig. 48.â€”Wagnerella borealis, Mereschk. A, Whole specimen seen under a low magnification: H., head containing the central grain ; P, stalk ; N., nucleus contained in the basal plate of attachment. B, Enlarged view of the head, after fixation and staining with iron-ha3ma- toxylin: c, cuticle of the stalk; ps., pseudopodia; ax., axial filaments of the pseudopodia, each arising from a basal granule; e.g., central grain. After /^ Zuelzer (86). Few problems in cytology have been more discussed than the question of the nature and origin of the centrosome, and three opposed views have been put forward which may be termed, re- spectively, the achromatinic theory, the nucleolo - centrosomic theory, and the nuclear theory.

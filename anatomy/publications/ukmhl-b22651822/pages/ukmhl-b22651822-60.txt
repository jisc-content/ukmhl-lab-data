These two zones of the protoplasmic body are, in the more primi- tive forms, differentiations of the protoplasm more or less tem- porary and transient in nature. For instance, in an amoeba which IS ni active movement, fluid endoplasm is constantly flowing along the axes of the pseudopodia towards their tips, where it com'es into contact with the surrounding medium, the water or other fluid in Avhich the amoeba lives. Under the influence of the medium the endoiolasm is converted into ectoplasm, becomes of stiiier, less fluid consistence, and loses its coarse granulations. At the same time, at the hinder end of the amoeba, ectoplasm is continually passing into the interior of the body, where it becomes liquefied and granular in structure, and is converted into endoplasm (Rhumbler, 34). In Protozoa, however, which do not exhibit amoeboid movement, the ectoplasm and endoplasm may be two independent layers, well defined and perfectly separate the one from the other. The ecto- plasm is the seat of those functions which are connected with the relation of the organism to the outer world, to the environment in which it lives ; the endoplasm, on the other hand, is concerned specially with the internal affairs, so to speak, of the protoplasmic body. In the following two chapters the various organs of the Protozoa will be considered under the headings of the layer from which they are formed, and according to the functions they perform

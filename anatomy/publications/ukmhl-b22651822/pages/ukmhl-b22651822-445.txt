The spore as a whole (F g. 172, 16, r2 3) SSed, with one end, commonly termed " anterior," narrower than the othi. It contains two vacuoles, one near the anterior the other oo^ tT?A JnXrior end The single polar capsule is of relatively large size ; sTated^S: lyTn tl^^^^^^^ it oclipL its wLe length, and contains a polar mament of immense length, womid spirally in its mterior J^.f ^" a spore 6 in length may eject a polar fflament 150 long (Stempell, 784 while in PleistopJwra longifilis the fflament may measure as much as 510 mom than forty one time's the length of the spore (Schuberg) The e^stence STpolar capsule is denied by Schuberg, who mamtams that the fflament is coiled up within the posterior vacuole of the spore. The amoebula occupies the middle region of the spore, between the two vacuoles, and apparently separating them ; but in reality it has the form of a rine or girdle, wrapping round the axial polar capsule and fflament, and placed slightly nearer the anterior pole of the spore. The amoebula contams at first a single nucleus, which, according to StempeU, divides into two and then into four. Schuberg, however, maintains that the amoebula, and indeed the entire spore, contams but a single nucleus; he denies the existence of parietal and capsulogenous nuclei, and in his opinion the bodies that ha,ve been interpreted as such are in reaUty metachromatinic grams. Stempell s description of the development of the spore is, however, m accordance with that given by other investigators. i . ^, i When the spore germinates in the intestine ot a new host, the polar filament is shot out, and the amoebula creeps out through a pore at the anterior end ; there would appear to be at this point a smaU cap which closes the spore, and which is blown off by the explosion of the polar capsule (Fig. 172, 4). Accord- ing to Stempell, the amoebula emerges from the spore with two nuclei, leaving the other two behind in the sporocyst as reduction-nuclei; then the two nuclei of the amoebula copulate, in an autogamous manner, to form a synkaryon, and the uninucleate amoebula that results initiates the generation of planonts. It seems, however, not improbable that some process of copulation with other amcebulEe, liberated from other spores, may occur at this stage, and remains to be described. A life-cycle similar in the main to that described for Nosema bomhycis, with planonts, meronts, and sporonts, as successive phases, is probably Fig. 172 continued: 9—13, multiplication of the meront (schizont) in the cell, in two different ways, the one shown in the series 9a, lOct, 11a, 12a, 13a, the other in the series 96, 106, 116, 126, 12c, 12d, 136 : 13, a and 6, young sporonts ; 14, divisions of the nucleus of the sporont; two small nuclei which have been budded off at the lower end are the future parietal nuclei; from the principal nucleus the nucleus of the j)olar capsule is being budded off ; 15, 16, formation of tho spore, with two parietal nuclei, one capsulogenous nucleus applied to the polar capsule, and the nucleus of tho sporozoite, at first smgle (15), later double (10). After Stempell (785), slightly modified.

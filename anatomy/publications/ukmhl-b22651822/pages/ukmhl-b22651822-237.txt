THE SARCODINA 219 smaU amoeboid form which, like Pseudospora, preys upon algse (Fig. 86), devouring the contents of the cell, and multiplying m the free state by binary fission. It also encysts and breaks up within the cyst by multiple fission to form a number of amoebulse, which creep out and grow up into the adult form. A large number of other genera are referred to the Reticulosa, for the most part so little investigated as regards their develop- ment and life-history that it is impossible to deal with them com- prehensively in a brief space. For an account of them see Delage and Herouard (6, p. 66), Hickson (248), and Rhumbler (288). 2. Lohosa.—This suborder comprises a great number of organisms, which it is convenient to subdivide into—(a) Nuda (Gymnamoebse), Fig. 86.—Vampyrdla lateritia: various forms. A, Free Heliozoon-like phase ; B, creeping amoeboid phase ; C, amceboid form attached to a Gonferva-Giei- ment; D, a similar form ; it has broken the algal filament at a joint, and has emptied one cell of its contents. A and B after Hoogenraad ; G and D after Cash and Hopkinson. with no shell; and (&) Testacea (Thecamoebse, Thalamophora), with a shell or house. General Characters.—Fam.ilia,Y examples of the Lobosa Nuda are furnished by the species of the genus Amosha and allied forms. A very large number of free-Hving amoebae have been described and named, but it is very doubtful how far they are true species ; some of them, with pronounced and constant characteristics, such as Am(x:ha proteus (Fig. 2) and A. verrucosa (Fig. 23), are probably "good" species; others, such as A. Umax and A. radiosa, are probably forms that may occur as phases in the development of other species of amoebae or of other organisms, such as Mycetozoa.

430 CHAPTER XVII THE INFUSORIA The term Infusoria had originally a much wider apphcation than at present, being used to denote the various microscopic animalcules which make their appearance in infusions exposed to the air. Hence the Infusoria included any Protozoa, and even organisms distinct from them, such as Rotifers. Just as the word " insect " has been restricted in its zoological application to a smgle class—the Insecta Hexapoda—so the term Infusoria has become narrowed down to denote the Infusoria Ciliata and Suctoria, which constitute, taken together, one of the most defuiite and sharply-marked classes of the Protozoa, characterized by two principal structural features : first, the possession of cilia during the whole or a part of their active life ; secondly, the differentiation of the nuclear apparatus into a vegeta- tive macronucleus and a generative micronucleus (p. 153). The Infusoria fall naturally into two subclasses : the Ciliata proper, in which the cilia are retained throughout life; and the Acinetaria or Suctoria, in which cilia are present only during the early or larval phases of the life-history, and are lost in the adult organism, which is of sedentary habit, and in which food- capture is effected by special organs—suctorial tentacles. Subclass I.—Ciliata. The Ciliata, the most abundant and familiar of microscopic forms of life, may be considered in a sense the highest of the Protozoa, since in no other class does the cell-body attain to so great a com- plication of parts and organs or to so high a degree of structural differentiation. Not even in the Metazoa are single cells to be found of such visibly complicated structure, since in the Metazoa the cell is specialized usually for one particular function of a livmg body, while in the Ciliata the single cell performs all the functions of life. Moreover, the differentiation of the nuclear apparatus into generative and vegetative portions may be considered analogous with, and parallel to, the differentiation of germen and soma in the Metazoa ; and Lewin (172) regards the micronucleus as living inde-

Some genera have not, however been investigated sufficiently to make their systematic position certain Suborder I. : Prococcidia. Trophozoites free, vermiform, motile; schizogony similar in type to that of bchizogregarines. The only genus known at present is Sdenococcidium. iiie genus StedUckia should perhaps be placed here, perhaps in the Schizo- gregarines near Schizocystis ; its sporogony is as yet unknown. Suborder II. : Eucoccidia. Trophozoites typically intracellular, motionless, oviform, rarely free or vermiform ; schizogony of coccidian type. Section A.—Forms in which the sporonts do not associate prior to gamete- formation, and numerous microgametes are produced : Family 1 : Coccidiidce {Eimeridce).—The schizogony is of a simple type, as described in C. schubergi. Examples: Coccidium (Eimeria) and allied genera ; Barroussia (Barrouxia), with type B. ornata, from the gut of Nepa cinerea ; Cyclospora, including C. caryolytica, from the intestine of the mole; and other genera. Cryptosporidium muris, from the gastric glands of the mouse, has free trophozoites and produces a single tetrazoic spore. Family 2 : Caryotrophidce.—With double multiple fission in the schizogony. Example: Caryotropha mesnilii, parasite of the Annelid Polymnia nebulosa (Siedlecki, 653). Klossiella muris,* from the kidney of the mouse, should perhaps be referred to this family, possibly also Merocystis kathce (Dakin). Section B.—Forms in which the sporonts (gametocytes) associate prior to gamete-formation, and the number of male gametes is reduced to four: Family 3 : Adeleidce.—With sporocysts. Examples : Adelea, with several species, of which the best known is A. ovata, parasite of the intestine of Lithobius ; Klossia, with type K. helicina, from the kidneys of Helix spp. ; Orcheobius herpobddlce, from the testis of the leech Herpobdella (Kunze) ; and Caryospora simplex, from the intestine of Vipera aspis, in which the contents of the oocyst form a single octozoic spore (Leger, 644). Minchinia chitonis, from the liver of Chiton and Patella spp., should perhaps be referred to this family, but the gamete-formation is not yet known. Family 4: Legerdlidce.—Without sporocysts. Example: Legerella nova, parasite of the Malpighian tubes of Glomeris. A classification similar in the main to the above has been put forward by Leger (644), who terms Section A the Eimeridea, Section B the Adeleidea. * My friend Dr. A. C. Stevenson, of the Pathological Department, University College, who has studied Klossiella, informs me that he considers it possible that it may represent a stage of Hcemogregarina muscvli (p.;^377). I

THE HiEMOFLAGELLATES AND ALLIED FORMS 287 from a given spot. Many trypanosomes, especially the large stout forms, are very sluggish in their movements, and show but little power of progression. At the opposite extreme, in this respect, is the African parasite of cattle, well named by Ziomann T. vivax, which, according to Bruce and his collaborators (411, iii.), " dashes across the field of the microscope with such rapidity that it is impossible to follow its movements, cyclone-like leaving a clear path, the corpuscles in its track having been flung on either side. If it remains at the same spot for a time, as it sometimes does, it has an appearance of great energy and power, throwing the surrounding red blood-corpuscles about in wild confusion." In the foregoing paragraphs the terms " anterior " and " posterior," as applied to the trypanosome-body, have been used strictly with reference to its mode of progression. It is pointed out below, in the comparison with other types such as Trypawplasma and Crithidia, that the extremity Fig. 126.—a, Trypanosoma tincw of the tench ; note the veiy broad undulatiae membrane in this species; B, C, T. percoe of the perch, slender and stout forms.

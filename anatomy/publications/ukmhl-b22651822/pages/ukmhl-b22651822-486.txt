456 THE PROTOZOA stalked forms the body is raised up from the point of attachment on a straight, non-contractile stalk of secreted substance, similar to that of many Vortioellids, and the animal as a whole may resemble in its general contours an Episiylis or other VorticeUid (Pigs. 10, 190). Collin (877) finds that the stalk consists of a sheath, a cor- tical layer thickest at the base, and a medullary substance stratified longitudinally to the longitudinal axis. The base of the stalk rests on a cushion of secreted substanceâ€”the portion which is first formed, and which is produced by a special organ of the larva comparable to the scopula (p. 441) of the Vorticellids. The body is often protected by a secreted house or theca, con- tinuous with the stalk in the pedunculate forms. In Astrophrya arenaria the house is built up of foreign particles of various sizes (Awerinzew). As in the attached ciliates, colonies may be formed of considerable size and extent, and of various forms. The non- pedunculate genus Dendrosoma produces spreading colonies, which bear a considerable resemblance to a polyi)-colony. The characteristic tentacles arc stiff j)rotoplasmic jDrocesses con- sisting of a parietal layer of ectoplasm in the form of a tube en- closing a canal containing fluid. The apex of the tentacle usually terminates in a sucker-like laaob ; suctorial tentacles (" Saugten-

429 THE NEOSPORIDIA regularity with which the sporozoite in the Neosporidia has the form of an amoebula, as contrasted Avith the equally-constant gregarinula- form of the Telosporidian sporozoite. The characters implied in the terms Ama3bogeni8e and Rhabdogeniie appear to be more diagnostic of the two groups than any other. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the union of the Telosporidia and Neosporidia in one class—the Sporozoa—is a quite artificial arrangement, and that the two subclasses in question show distinct affinities, and are descended from distinct ancestral forms—the Telosporidia from Flagellata, the Neosporidia from Sarcodina.

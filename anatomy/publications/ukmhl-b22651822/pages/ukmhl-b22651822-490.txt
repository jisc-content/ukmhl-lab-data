460 THE PROTOZOA The conjugation of the Acinetaria conforms in general to the type of the process seen in CiHata, as regards cytological details. Conjugation may take place between two individuals fixed near Fig. 193.—Free-swimming larva of Dendrosoma radians. A, Side veiw ; B, viewed from above ; 0, older larva with the first rudiments of the tentacles beginning to appear. After Hickson and Wadsworth (886). together (Fig. 190, C) ; then a lobe or outgrowth may be formed from one individual, which meets a similar outgrowth from the other, thus establishing contact. On the other hand, as in Peri- tricha, conjugation may take place between a fixed, ordinary indi- vidual and a free-swimming bud or larva liberated from another adult individual (Martin ; Collin, 879). In Dendrocomeies the macronuclei come into contact during conjugation, but separate again (Hickson and Wadsworth). Classification.—The Acinetaria are divisible into eight families (c/. Doflein, 7). 1. Hypocomidce, for the single, somewhat aberrant genus Hypocoina, which is free-swimming, ciliated on one surface, and wnth a single suctorial tentacle— possibly a persistent larval form (see Collin, 877). 2. Urnulidai.—With or without a house, with, one or few tentacles.' Rhyn- cheta, Vrnula (Fig. 191). 3. Metacinetidai.—With a stalked house opening at the upper end for the exit of the tentacles.

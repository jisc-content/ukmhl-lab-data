Until further researches have been undertaken, the position of the drepanidia must remain uncertain. ^eresheimer (720) has described the penetration of the red blood-corpuscles by Lankesterella sp., a process in which remarkable phenomena are extnbited. When a Lankesterella, in approaching a blood-corpuscle, is within a distance from the corpuscle about equal to the length of the parasite, the eage of the corpuscle turned towards the parasite shows distinct amoeboid movements. As the parasite comes still nearer, two long processes are thrown out by the corpuscle, forming a deep bay, into which the parasite enters; as soon as it does so, the two processes approach each other, fuse and engulf the parasite, just as an amoeba ingests its prey. The parasite, after this point IS reached, appears to be drawn into the corpuscle without further exertion on its part; the protoplasm of the corpuscle closes up behind it, and the corpuscle regains its normal smooth contour, with the parasite lying within it. The whole process of penetration takes one or two minutes. Neresheimer compares the activity of the corpuscle to the " cone of reception " formed by an ovum when approached by a spermatozoon. From the foregoing account of the life-cycles of hajmogregarines, it is seen that the sporogony varies greatly, from the production of eight sporozoites in the oocyst of H. stepanowi and H. nicorice, to the condition of H. canis, H. muris, and H. gerhilli, in which a large number of spores are formed with a variable number of sporozoites. It is impossible, therefore, to accept as adequate the diagnosis given by Leger (644) of the " Hcemogregarinidce " as ■ producing a single octozoic spore (see p. 353, supra). 5. The Piroplasms.—The parasites of this type are minute organisms, capable of amoeboid movement, but generally of a definite form, which is usually pear-shaped or rod-like. They are contained, sometimes as many as a dozen or more together, within a mammalian red blood-corpuscle. They produce no pigment, but destroy the corpuscle in which they are contained, and set free the haemoglobin, which is then excreted by the kidneys of the host. In consequence of this, the diseases produced by these parasites, termed generally " piroplasmoses " (or " babesioses "), are of a very characteristic type, the most strikmg symptoms being an enormous destruction of blood-corpuscles and a red coloration of the urine by hsemoglobin (haemoglobinuria). From this peculiarity are derived popular names, such as " redwater," etc., applied to diseases caused by piroplasms.

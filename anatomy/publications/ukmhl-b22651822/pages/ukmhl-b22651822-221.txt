THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 203 to gases may be considered as equivalent to a sense of smell in higher organisms (osmotaxis). It has been shomi by many experiments that a given species is attracted towards certain chemical substances, repelled by others. Thus, Paramecium is attracted towards weak acids, but repelled by them in greater concentration. If a drop of acid of suitable strength is placed in the midst of a number of Paramecia distributed evenly in the water under a cover-slip on a slide, they tend to gather round the drop. As the drop diffuses in the surrounding water, the Paramecia arrange themselves in a ring in the region of optimum concentration. If, however, the drop of fluid employed is of a strength which represents the optimum of chemotaxis for the species. Fig. 83.â€”Diagram showing the course taken by a Paramecium which has entered a drop of fluid to which it is positively chemotactic. The forward movements of the Paramecium are radicated by arrows; its backward movements by dotted lines ; the outhne of the drop of fluid by a circle. Each time thi Paramecium, m its forward movement, reaches the confines of the drop it iTn wl^iS T*^ ^""'i l"?^"^!" ^"'^ positively chemotactic than the dl-op whioM ^.nl^f f backward (avoiding reaction), after et^'oi^thTc^op'^T^^^^^^^ --^^ time it reaches the the Paramecia gather within it, and in such a case the position taken up by each Paramecium depends on the avoiding reaction made by It when It comes in contact with a less attractive medium Thus If a Paramecium., swimming in a straight Hne, enters a drop of fluid which IS positively chemotactic to it, when it has crossed the drop to Its opposite boundary it comes to the region where it meets with fluid which IS less chemotactic to it; it then shrinks back with an avoiding movement; after a time it again moves forward, and comes again into the negatively chemotactic region, with the same result as betore. Thus its movements are as if caught in a trap (Fig 83) m which It IS held by the automatic movements called forth by the difference between the more and the less chemotactic fluids, until

THE NUCLEUS 89 from which daughtei-tufts of flagella grow out ; the old tufts, with then- rings of blepharoplasts, persist for some tjme after the new ones have been formed (Fig. 45, G), but ultimately they degenerate and disappear. The ring of blepharoplasts m Lophomonas is supported on the edge of a membranous structure, or " calyx," which in its turn is surrounded by a peculiar striated body, the " collar " of Grassi, or " parabasal apparatus " of Janicki (Fig. 45, d.). Janicki (71) has found a corresponding parabasal apparatus in other flagellates, especially in TrichonympJddce ; the significance

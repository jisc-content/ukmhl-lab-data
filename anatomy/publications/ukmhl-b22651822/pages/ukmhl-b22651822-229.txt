THE GENEEAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PROTOZOA 211 the merozoon which survived was not necessarily the one which contained the micronuclcus. Kogcnerated individuals multiplied for a number of genera- tions, producing a culture of " amicronucleato " Paramecia. If, on the other hand, a Paramecium in process of division was halved, each half regenerated the entire body and was capable of division. These experiments indicate that Paramecnim contains a division-centre independent of the nuclei, and that its presence is necessary for regeneration of the body. Prowazek (189) observed occasionally a certain power of regeneration in non-nucleated fragments of Stentor, but considered it possible that extra- nuclear chromatin might have been present. The same author (190) ob- served abnormal regeneration, leading to monstrosities with three hinder ends, in a culture of Stylonycliia mytilus during a depression-period which led finally to the extinction of the culture. The recent experiments of Lewin (172) on Stylonycliia mytilus show that, in the regeneration which follows artificial mutilation, multiplication of micronuclei may occur, with the result that the regenerated individual may have more micronuclei than the number typical of the species or race.

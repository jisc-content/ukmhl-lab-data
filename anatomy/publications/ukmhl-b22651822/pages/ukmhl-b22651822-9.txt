PREFACE This book, cas its name implies, is intended to serve as an mtro- duction to the subject with which it deals, and not in any way as a complete treatise upon it. The science of " protozoology," as it is now generally termed, covers a vast field, and deals with an immense series of organisms infinitely varied m form, structure, and modes of hfe. In recent years the recognition of the importance of the Protozoa to mankind in various ways, and especiaUy from the medical point of view, has focussed attention upon them, and has brought about a great increase of our knowledge concerning these forms of life. To set forth adequately and in full detail all that is now known about the Protozoa would be a task that could not be attempted in a volume of this size, but would require a work many times larger. The aim of the present work is essentially didacticâ€”that is to say, it is intended to furnish a guide to those who, having at least some general knowledge of biology, desire a closer acquaintance with the special problems presented by the Protozoa. First and foremost, it attempts to define the position of these organisms in Nature, and to determine, as far as possible, in this way exactly what should be included under the term " Protozoa," and what should be excluded from the group. Secondly, its function is to guide the student through the maze of technicalities necessarily surrounding the study of objects unfamiliar in daily life, and requiring, consequently, a vocabulary iriore extensive than that of common language ; and with this aim in view, care has been taken to define or explain f uUy aU technical terms, since confusion of thought can be avoided only by a clear understanding of their exact significance and proper application. Thirdly, it aims at introducing the student to the vast series of forms comprised in the Protozoa and their systematic classification, based on their mutual affinities and inter-relationships, so far as these can be inferred from their structural peculiarities and their life-histories. And, incidentally, attention has been drawn specially to those parts of the subject where the Protozoa throw

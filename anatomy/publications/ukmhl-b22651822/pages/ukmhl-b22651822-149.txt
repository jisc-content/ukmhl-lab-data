SYNGAMY AND SEX IN THE PROTOZOA 131 stitutiiig the complex body of a Metazoan individual; the other represented by the single cells of which both soma and germon alike are built up. The phrase " reproduction," whether sexual or non-sexual, as apijlied to the Metazoa, refers only to the complex multicellular body as a whole, and not to its constituent cells, which reproduce themselves uninterruptedly by fission during the whole life-cycle. In the comparison of a typical Protozoan life-cycle with that of the Metazoa, we may start in both cases alike from a single cell- mdividual which is the result of an act of syngamy. In Protozoa, also, the zygote multiplies, sooner or later, to produce numerous cell-individuals ; but in this case the cells remam separate from one another and independent, so that no multicellular body is produced, except in the colony-building species, nor is there any distuaction of somatic and germinal cells, save in rare cases, such as Volvox (p. 267). In Protozoa the phenomena of vital exhaustion, so-called " senility " (Maupas) or " depression " (Calkins, Hertwig)' appear to be as inevitable as in the cells of the Metazoan body (see pp. 135 and 208, infra); but if the derangement of the bodily functions and the vital mechanism has not gone too far, the organism IS able to recuperate itself by self-regulative processes, of which the most important and most natural are those involved in the normal process of syngamy. Consequently no cell - individuals among Protozoa are doomed necessarily and inevitably to decadence and death, but r 1 possess equally potential immortality—that is to say, the capacity for infinite reproduction by fission under favour- able conditions. The Metazoan individual is represented in the Protozoa only by the entire life-cycle, from one act of syngamy to the next, and not by any living organic individual In the life-cycle of a Protozoon, as there is only one individuality, so there IS only one method of reproduction-that, namely, of the cell by fission ; and it must be made clear that the reproduction m Protozoa, any more than in Metazoa ^ ^ It has been pointed out above that the life-history of a Protist Tr'' 1"™'^ and Voductt 1 1 those Piotozoa m which syngamy has been observed, it is found a period of reproduction, sometimes at the end of a period cf may be a difference between the two sexes of the same species ll l owT!n1 ''''' '^^^^'^y ^'^kes place be ween uU grown individuals of the species, as in Aclmophrys (Fig 71)- second case, syngamy is between the smallest individuals produced

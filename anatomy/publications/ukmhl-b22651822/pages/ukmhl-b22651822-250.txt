232 THE PROTOZOA just before. Hence a distinction must be drawn between mono- thalamous or smgle-chambered shells and polythalamous shells, made up of many chambers formed successively. In the latter type the new chambers may be joined in various ways to the old O.PIanorbulina 10 ll.Nummulires Fig. 93.â€”Shells of various genera of Foraminifera. In 3, 4, and 5, a shows the surface-view, and 6 a section ; 8a is a diagram of a coiled shell without supple- mental skeleton; 86, of a similar form with supplemental skeleton (,s.sk.); 10, of a form with overlapping whorls ; in lies half the shell is shown in hori- zontal section ; 6 is a vertical section. In all the figures a marks the aperture of the sheU; 1 to 15, the successive chambers, 1 being always the oldest or initial chamber. From Parker and Haswell. producing usually either a linear or a spiral series, and the utmost variety of shape and pattern results in different species (Fig. 93). Some polythalamous species exliibit a peculiar dimorphism (Fig. 94)

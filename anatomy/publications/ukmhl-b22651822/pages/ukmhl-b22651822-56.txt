CHAPTER IV 40 THE ORGANIZATION OP THE PROTOZOA {Goniinued)- THE PROTOPLASMIC BODY The substance composing the bodies of Protozoa was termed originally sarcode by Dujardin; but after it had been shown to be Identical in nature with the living substance of the ceUs of animals and plants, the same term was employed universaUy for both and the word 'protoplasm, coined by von Mohl to designate the living substance of plant-cells, supplanted the older term sarcode, which has now quite dropped out of current use. It would be impossible within the limits of the present work to discuss in detail the various theories that have been put forward with regard to the nature and constitution of protoplasm ; they can only be summarized in brief outline here. Protoplasm,' when seen under the microscope with powers of moderate strength, presents itself as a viscid, semi-fluid substance, sometimes clear and hyaline in special regions, but ahvays showing, throughout at least the greater part of its substance, numerous granulations, which vary greatly in size, from relatively coarse grains to those of the minutest size visible with the power of the microscope used. The most important of these granulations are the so-called " chi-omatin- gi-ains," which are discussed fully in Chapter VI. ; in this chapter only non-chromatinic granules are dealt with. The coarser proto- plasmic grains may be present in greater or less quantity, or may be entirely absent; they are to be regarded for the most part as so-called metaplastic bodiesâ€”that is to say, as stages in, or by- products of, the upward or downward metabolism of the organism. On the other hand, the minute, ultimate granules, or " microsomes," are never absent, except over limited areas, in any sample of proto- plasm. It is on the constant presence of granules that the so-called granular theory of protoplasm, especially connected with the name of Altmann, has been founded. On this view, each minute granule is regarded as an elementary organism, or " bioblast," capable in itself of all vital functions, and equivalent to a single free-living bacterium, just as a single ceU of a Metazoan body may be compared with a single Protozoan organism. Protoplasm, on this view, is re*

THE REPRODUCTION OF THE PROTOZOA 109 plate, which divides into two equally definite daughter-plates com- posed of distmct chromosomes ; Avhether this division is brought about by splitting of the individual chromosomes is not clear. When the nucleus is finally constricted into the two daughter- nuclei, the chromosomes are at first aggregated close beside their respective karyosomes, but soon distribute themselves in the manner already described. The simple types of mitosis described in the two foregoing para- graphs are examples of the so-called " promitosis " (Nagler, 95) Fig. 56.—The two methods of Duclear division in Amaiba diplomitolica. A, Resting nucleus ; B—G, first method ; H—K, second method. In F and G only one of the two halves of the nuclear figure is drawn. After Aragao (87). seen commonly in nuclei of the protokaryon-type. The nuclear membrane in this type is a negligible quantity ; it may be scarcely or not at all developed in the resting nucleus, and when a distinct membrane is present it may vanish entirely during the mitosis, as in the form just described. In any case, hoAvever, the entire mitosis goes on within the nuclear space. The chromosomes may show every possible condition in different cases, from complete irregu- larity in form, number, arrangement, and mode of division, to the

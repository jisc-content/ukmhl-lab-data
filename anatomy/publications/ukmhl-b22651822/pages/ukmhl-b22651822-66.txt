THE PROTOZOA 50 is probably of endoplasmic origin, and is pushed out from it in a centrifugal direction. As it grows out, the ectoplasm forms a sheath over it, and extends usually some way beyond it. When the pseudopodium is retracted, the axial rod is liquefied and absorbed by the protoplasm. Food-capture is effected by the pseudopodia in various ways (see p. 189). In forms with lobose pseudopodia they flow round the body to be ingested, enclosing it on all sides, and finally imprisoning the prey in a closed chamber of the living substance, together with a drop of water which forms the food - vacuole (Fig. 2, P\ P^) in which the prey is digested (p. 192, infra). A very noticeable feature of pseudopodia of all kinds is their adhesive- ness, due to the secretion of a slimy substance at the surface of the ectoplasm. In DiffLugia, if the pseudo- podia be touched gently with a glass rod, the slime can be dra-wn out into threads, like the mucus of a snail (Rhumbler, 34). The adhesive power of the pseudopodia is of service both in adhering to the surface upon which they creep and in the capture of their food. The slow-flowing amoebae, such as A. verru- cosa, do not as a rule flow round the body to be in- gested, but draw it into their interior, as if by suction. In this manner^, verrucosa absorbs and devours filamentous algae (Fig. 23), which are " imported " into the interior of the body and there coiled up and digested. Rhumbler has shown that this process can be imitated by drops of fluid; for instance, a drop of chloroform m water will draw in a thread of sheUac and coil it up in its interior m a manner similar to the ingestion of an algal filament by an amoeba.

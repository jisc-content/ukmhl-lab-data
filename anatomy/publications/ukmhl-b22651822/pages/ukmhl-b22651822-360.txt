THE PROTOZOA 340 Pfeflfer asserts that the young intracellular stages of the mealworm- gregarine multiply by fission. Porospora, with its remarkable schizogony, is apparently a septate cephaline gregarine of tlie Fig. 151.â€”Diagram of the life-cycle of Ophryocystis, after Leger (617, i.). A, The spore setting free sporozoites ; B, the sporozoite attached by its rostrum to the epithelium of the Malpighian tubule ; G, multiplication of the nucleus of the sporozoite, and growth to form D, the multinucleate or " mycetoid " schizont ; E, division of the multinucleate schizont into a number of mero- zoites (F), each of which may become a multinucleate schizont again, or {0, H) may become a paucinucleate or " gregarinoid " schizont; H, division of the paucinucleate schizont to form young sporonts (/, J); K, association of two sporonts ; L, formation of a common cyst round the associated sporonts, and division of their nuclei ; M, formation of three nuclei in each sporont; N separation of a gamete (g.) within the body of each sporont, while the rest of the body, with two nuclei, becomes an envelope-cell; 0. the two gametes have fused to form the zygote (z.) or sporoblast ; P. the sporoblast has as- sumed the form of the spore, and its nuclei have divided into four; lUtimately eight nuclei and as many sporozoites are formed. ordinary type. A character such as the possession of the power of multiplication by schizogony is clearly one of great adaptive importance in the life-history of a parasitic organism, and therefore

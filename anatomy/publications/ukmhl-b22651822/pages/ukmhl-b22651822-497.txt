CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAIN SUBDIVISIONS 467 ridge, commonly but wrongly termed an " undulating membrane," running the length of the body. The type of the genus is C. bal- hianii, originally named by Certes Trypanosoma halbianii, from the crystalline style of the oyster. 3. Saprospira, Gross (898), for free-living, saprophytic forms similar in structure to Grisiispira, but without the crest. 4. Spiroschaudinnia, the name proposed by Sambon for the many species of minute spirochaetes parasitic in the blood of verte- brates and in various invertebrates. Such are ;S^. recurrentis { = obermeieri), parasite of human relapsing fever; iS. dutloni, parasite of African relapsing fever ; 8. gallinarum of fowls ; 8. anserina of geese; and numerous other species from various hosts. In structure the body of these species appears to be little, if any- thing, more than a flexible thread of chromatin ; but the develop- ment indicates rather that, as in the genus Grisiispira, the interior of the body is divided into minute segments or chambers. The species parasitic in blood are transmitted by the agency of blood-sucking arthropods. 8. duttoni, for example, is transmitted by a tick-- Ornithodoros moM&ato—which lives in the mud-floors of huts or in the soil in spots where caravans camp habitually. The spirocha^tes are taken up from human blood by the adult ticks, and pass through the egg into the next generation of nymphs,* which transmit the infection to human beings. 5. Treponema, the name proposed by Schaudinn for T. pallidum, the spkocha3te of syphihs discovered by him. A second species— T. pertenue, the parasite of yaws (framboesia)—is also recognized. Structurally this type is very similar to the last.

155 SYNGAMY AND SEX IN THE PROTOZOA spermatozoon is not indispensable for supplying a developmental stimulus ; an unfertilized ovum can be induced by artificial stimuli of various kinds to start upon a course of development similar to that initiated, under natural circumstances, by fertilization with a spermatozoon. Hence, of the two results produced in the fertiliza- tion of Metazoa, amphimixis alone would appear to be that which is essential and peculiar in the process, and which only fertilization can bring about. From the above considerations, amphimixis is regarded by many thinkers as the essence of sjmgamy, a necessity for the evolution of livmg beings in that it supplies, by the intermingling of different hereditary tendencies, the conditions required for the production of " innate " variations in organisms in which the germinal substance is shielded from the direct influence of external conditions by its position withia a multicellular body. Apart from the question, however, whether any such innate variations exist in the Protozoa, where all cells alike are exposed equally to the direct action of the environment, the criticism has often been made that amphimixis gives only a teleological explanation of the sexual process, and as such cannot be invoked as a causal explanation of its origin. The intermingling of distinct hereditary tendencies, however useful to the organism or important in the evolution of living beings generally, cannot be regarded as the incentive to syngamy at its first appear- ance in the Protista. In other words, amphimixis must be regarded as a secondary consequence, not as a primary cause, of syngamy. It is necessary, therefore, to seek some explanation for the first origin of syngamy other than the benefits which it may confer through amphimixis, and it is undoubtedly among Protist organisms that the conditions under which sjoigamy first arose must be sought. It has been pomted out above that syngamy appears to have a strengthening or recuperating effect upon the cell-organism, and upon such grounds has been founded the theory of " rejuven- escence " (Verjiingung). According to this theory, connected chiefly with the name of Maupas, the cell-protoplasm, after many generations of reproduction by fission, tends to become effete and senile to an ever - increasmg degree, a condition which, if not remedied, ends in the death of the organism ; the natural remedy IS furnished, however, by the process of syngamy, which has the effect of renewing the " youth " of the cell and starting it upon a fresh series of generations, until senility, once more supervening, necessitates syngamy again. The rejuvenescence-theory has been criticized by many critics who have themselves done little more, in some cases, than give more precise meaning to the terms "youth" and "old age," terms that certainly stand in need of further explanation, since a

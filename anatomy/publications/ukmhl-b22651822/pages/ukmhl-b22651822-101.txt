83 THE NUCLEUS some when it is active in relation to the division of the nucleus, and a blepharoplast when it is in connection with flagella or other motile organs during the resting state of the nucleus. In this, probably the most primitive state of things, there are, further, two different structural conditions found to occur in different cases. First, the centrosome - blepharoplast maybe within, or closely attached to, the nucleus ; secondly, it may be quite independent of the nucleus, and some distance from it in the cell- body, during the resting state of the nucleus. In the first case—of which an example is seen in Mastigina (Figs. 38, 39), paralleled by collar - cells in the Leuco- soleniid type of calcareous sponges—the flagellum ap- pears to arise directly from the nucleus; in the second case, exemplified by Mas- tigella (Fig. 40), and by collar-cells of the Clathrinid type, the fiagellum takes origin quite independently of the resting nucleus. In both cases alike, the flagel- lum generally disappears before division of the nucleus begins; the blepharoplast becomes the centrosome, divides, and initiates the division of the nucleus ; the new flagella of the daughter- cells grow out from the two daughter - centrosomes dur- ing or after division of the (j nucleus, and in either case, when the two daughter-cells are completely formed, their centro- somes, as blepharoplasts, remain as the basal granules from which the flagella arise. 2. The cell-body contains more than one body of centrosomic nature—namely, a definitive centrosome, in relation to the single nucleus, and, in addition to this, one or more blepharoplasts in relation to motile organs. Then, when division of the cell takes place, one of two things may happen. ^.-S n.

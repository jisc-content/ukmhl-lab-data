THE NUCLEUS 91 Camvlonema nutans, in Avhich a pseudopodium arises directly from each nucleus (Fig. 47).* In Acanthocystis (Fig. 18) an example is seen of the second type, the evolution of which can be traced in the actual development; in the buds of Acantlwcyshs a centriole is contained in the karyosome of the nucleus, but during the growth a ^ ^ . .2 05 o <D O ^ .2 2 w (B c3 o.a ^ [-1 CD .a 05 c3 a ° 2 a § rv, o c3 a CD — o ■ ■ C3 o. t-H of the bud into the adult condition the centriole passes out of the nucleus, and becomes the so-called " central grain " of the adult, a corpuscle which occupies the centre of the body, and upon which * In Aclinosphcerium, however, there is no relationship between the iiseudopodia and the nuclei. From tlie researches of Hcrtwig (G4), it is evident that in this form the ccntrosomes arc lost altogether during the vegetative life, and arc formed only in certain phases of the development (p. 115).

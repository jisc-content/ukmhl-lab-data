After Schuberg. Corresponding with the two types of the parasite mentioned above, there are two methods of development to be distinguished in the trophic phase. As an example of the first, Nosema homhycis, of which the development has recently been described in full detail by Stempell (785), may be selected ; while Glugea anomala (Stempell, 784) is an example of the second type. The development of Nosema bomhycis in the silkworm (Fig. 172) begins with small uninucleate amoebulEe, which are found first free in the digestive tract, and later in the lymph-channels (Fig. 172, 5-8); they multiply by simple fission and wander all over the body, and are hence termed planonts (i.e., wanderers) by Stempell. After a time the planonts penetrate into cells, and there grow larger, assume a defijiite oval or spherical form, and become " meronts" or schizonts, which multiply by binary or multiple fission until they have filled and exhausted the host-ceU (Fig. 172, 9-13) ; but they do not pass into other cells. The multiplication of the meronts may

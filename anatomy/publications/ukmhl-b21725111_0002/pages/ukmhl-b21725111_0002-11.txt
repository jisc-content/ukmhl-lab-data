A NEW Edition of "Quain's Anatomy" having been required, the duty of editing the Descriptive Anatomy has been under- taken by Dr. Allen Thomson, Professor of Anatomy in the University of Glasgow, and by Dr. Cleland, Professor of Anatomy in Queen's College, Galway. The text of the pai-t now pub- Hshed has been thoroughly revised, and in a great measure recast, by Dr. Cleland, with the assistance and supervision of Dr. Thomson. New Figures have for the most part been substituted for those of the former editions, drawn on a larger scale, and it is hoped more illustrative of the objects. The duty of selecting these figures and superintending their execution has been performed by Dr. Thomson. All those of the Bones and most of those of the Joints have been drawn by the Artist from the natural objects. Many of the figures of the Muscles have also been drawn from nature, and most of the others, though founded upon the most approved published prints, have been modified and finished from actual dissections. The plan of inscribing the names of the parts on the figures was, after careful consideration, not adopted, since its advantage over descriptions in close proximity, by reference letters or numbers, was thought to be on the whole more specious than real, and it has the disadvantage of dis- figuring and obscuring the design. The General Anatomy is, as before, revised by Dr. Sharpey, and is paged separately. The present part will be speedily followed by the rest of the work, which, when complete, will form two volumes.

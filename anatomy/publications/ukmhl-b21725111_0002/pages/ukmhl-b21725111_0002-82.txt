20 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. f om an addi lonal centre. On Uie body of each sacral vcrlel.ra, epiphysial plates aie termed at a later period, as in other vertebrae. To complete the OHsificatiou or the sacrum, there are also formed on each side of it two flat and irregular plates, ot Which one extends over the fir,st three vertebrse, while the other connects the last two. Pig. 19. C Fig. 19.—Ossification of the Sacrum. A, sacrum of a foetus before six months, seen from the front, showing the ossific nucleus n the body of each vertebra, from 1 downwards. B, sacrum of a child at birth, showing three pairs of additional nuclei for the lateral masses, 2, 2, close above the sacral foramina. C, sacrum of a person of about twenty five years of age. At 3 & 3, epiphysial plates are stdl visible above and below the first vertebral piece, and the fissures still remain between the first and second and the second and third lateral pieces; at 4 & 4' are shown the lateral epiphysial plates. Each of the coccygeal vertebrae is usually ossified from a single centre; but occa- sionally one of the first thi-ee contains two granules placed side by side. Progress of Ossification in the Vertebral Column.—The deposit of bone in the arches of the vertebraa takes place first in those belonging to the upper end of the column, and gradually proceeds downwards. In the bodies, it first occurs in the lower part of the dorsal region (about the ninth dorsal vertebra); and from that the process is extended upwards and downwards, reaching last of all the atlas and the coccyx, neither of which ossify till after birth. But though the nuclei of tlie lower dorsal vertebrEe are the first to api^ear, they are soon surpassed in size by those below them; and in the foetus at birth the relative size of the nuclei corresponds with that of the fully-grown vertebrse. In the subjoined table are stated the ages at which the osseous centres of the vertebral column appear and the steps of union take place. But it is to be observed that it is only attempted to state these ages approximately, both because of the great ditficulty, in most instances, of determining the age of the human foetus with accuracy, and because of a certain amount of variety which probably exists in the rapidity of the growth of bone in different cases.

PERIODS OF OSSTFICATIGN OF THE VERTEBRJE, In the vertebrae generally— The three primary centres appear in the 7th or 8th week (foetal life). The epiphyses of the processes appear in the 18th year or later. The epiphysial plates of the body appear in (,he 18th or 20th year. The two centres of the arch unite in the first year.

GENERAL ANATOMY. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE TEXTURES. Enumeration of the Textures.—The human body consists of solids and fluids. Only the solid parts can be reckoned as textures, properly so called; stUl, as some of the fluids, viz. the blood, chyle, and lymph, contain in suspension solid organised corpuscles of determinate form and organic properties, and are not mere products or secretions of a particular organ, or confined to a particular part, the corpuscles of these fluids, though not coherent textures, are to be looked upon as organised consti- tuents of the body, and as such may not improperly be considered along with the solid tissues. In conformity with this view the textures and other organised constituents of the frame may be enumerated as fol- lows :— The blood, chyle, and lymph. Epidermic tissue, including epithelium, cuticle, nails, and hairs. Pigment. Adipose tissue. Connective tissue, viz. Areolar tissue. Fibrous tissue. Elastic tissue. Cartilage and its varieties. Bone or osseous tissue. Muscle. Nerve. Blood-vessels. Absorbent vessels and glands. Serous and synovial membranes. Mucous membrane. Skin. Secreting glands. Vascular or ductless glands. Organic Systems.—Ever j texture taken as a whole was viewed by Bichat as constituting a peculiar system, presenting throughout its whole extent in the body characters either the same, or modified only so far as its local connections and uses render necessary ; he accordingly used the term a 2

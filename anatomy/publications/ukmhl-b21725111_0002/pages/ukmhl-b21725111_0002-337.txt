275 QUADRICEPS EXTENSOR CRURIS. backwards as they descend, are inserted in a similar maimer into the tendon below, the superior tendon being prolonged on the anterior, the inferior tendon on the posterior surface of the muscle. The inferior tendon forma a broad band inserted into the upper surface of the patella.

Superiorly this muscle is overlaid by the tensor vaginae femoris, iliacus, and sartorius muscles; further down it is covered only by- fascia. The acetabular tendon lies beneath the gluteus minimus. b. The vastus externus arises by an extensive aponeurosis attached to the base of the great trochanter in front, and to a ridge on its outer side, also to the line extending from that process to the linea aspera, and to the outer border of the linea aspera itself; the aponeurosis is prolonged on the surface of the muscle and gives origin to numerous muscular fibres : further it arises along the line which passes from the linea aspera to the external condyle in its upper two-thirds, by means of muscular fibres attached to the inter- muscular septum lying between it and the short head of the biceps. The supe- rior fibres descend perpendicularly, the lowest are nearly horizontal, and the muscle, forming an expanded sheet appUed to the surface of the crureus, ia inserted by a broad flat tendon into the tendon of the rectus muscle, the patella, and the fascia lata on the front and side of the knee-joint.

MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 188 The inferior constrictor arises from tlio side of the cricoid cartilage, and from the oblique lateral ridge aud upper and lower borders of the thyroid cartilage, aud curves backwards, expanding as it proceeds, and unites with its fellow in the middle line behind the pharynx. The direction of the inferior fibres is hoi-izoutal, concealing and overlapping the commencement of the oesophagus ; the rest ascend with increasing degrees of obliquity, and cover the lower part of the middle constrictor. The outer surface of the muscle is in contact at the side of the larynx with the thyroid body, the carotid artery, and the sterno-thyroid muscle; and from this last, where the two muscles meet on the thyroid cartiliige, some fibres are continued into the constrictor. The two laryngeal nerves pass inwards to the larynx, close respectively to the upper and lower margins of this constrictor—one being interposed between it and the middle constrictor, the other between it and the oesophagus. The inferior constrictor was described by the older anatomists as two muscles which received various names, the most appropriate of these being thyro-pharyngeus and crico-pharyngeus. In some animals they are found quite distinct from one another. Fig. 164. Fig. 164.—View os THE Muscles op THE Pharynx, &.o.

The middle constrictor, smaller tlum the preceding, arises from the upper part of the great cornu of the os hyoides, from the smaller cornu and from the stylo-hyoid ligament: its fibres diverging greatly pass back to the middle

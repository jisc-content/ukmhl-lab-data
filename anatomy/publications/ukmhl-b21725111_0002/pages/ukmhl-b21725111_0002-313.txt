The anterior layer, as already mentioned, becomes inseparably united with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and the posterior layer is similarly incorporated with that of the trausversalis. The upper border of the posterior lamina is attached to the mai-gius of the seventh and eighth ribs, as well as to the ensiform cartUage. This division, however, of the aponeurosis into layers stops short a little above the middle distance between the umbilicus and the pubis, the aponeurosis below that level remaining undivided, and along with Fig. 198.—Latekali View of the Fig. 198.

The deficiency thus resulting in the posterior wall of the sheath of the rectus muscle is marked superiorly by a well-defined lu- uated edge, whose concavity looks downwards towards the pubes—the semilujiar fold of Douglas. The internal oblique muscle is almost entirely covered by the ex- ternal oblique. A small angular portion only near the place where its posterior fibres take their origin, under cover of the latissimus dorsi, is exposed between that muscle and the external oblique, and even this is not constantly found. The cremaster, a muscle peculiar to the male, consists of fibres lying in

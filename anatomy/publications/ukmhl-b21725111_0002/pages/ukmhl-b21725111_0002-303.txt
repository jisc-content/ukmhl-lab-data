Thin tendinous fibres having the same direction as the external intercostal muscles are continued forwards between the costal cartilages from the points wliere the muscles cease to the sternum, and there Cover the internal intercostals.

IV, the fourth dorsal vertebra ; V, V, the fifth rib and its cartilage ; 1, 1, the levatovea costarum muscles, short and long ; 2, the external intercostal muscles in the upper of the two intercostal spaces represented ; 3, the internal intercostal layer shown in the lower of the two spaces represented by the removal of the extei'ual layer, and seen in A in the upper space, where the external layer terminates in front : the deficiency of the internal layer towards the vertebral column is shown in B. The internal intercostal muscles, placed deeper than the preceding, are attached to the inner margins of the ribs and their cartilages. Com- mencing at the anterior extremities of the cartilages of the ribs, they extend as far back as a point within the angles of those bones. The iibres incline downwards and backwards, crospiog those of the external intercostals ; they are, however, somewhat shorter and less oblique in their direction. The intcmal arc separated from the external intercostal muscles at the back of the spaces by the intercostal vessels and nerves ; they are lined internally by the pleura. The levatores cosiarum, twelve on each side, arise from the tips of tho transverse processes of tho seventh cervical and eleven highest dorsal ver- tebrte. Corresponding in direction with the external intercostal muscles, on which they lie, they pass downwards and outwards, spreading as they R

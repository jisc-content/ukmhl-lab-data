78 BONES OF THE UPPER LIMB. Texture.—The interior of the clavicle contains cojirse cancellated tissue in its whole extent. It almost always presents a foramen for a meduUary artery on its posterior surface, and sometimes others. THE HUMERUS. i I* wk 'if The humerus or arm bone extends from the scapula to the bones of the forearm, with each of which it is articulated. It hangs nearly vertically from the shoulder, with an inclination inwards towards the lower end. It is divisible into a superior extremity, including the head, neck, and greater and smaller tuberosities ; the shaft ; and the in- Fig. 69. ferior extremity, including the external and internal supracondyloid eminences, and the inferior articular surface. In general form it is subcylindrical and slightly twisted. The superior extremity is the thickest part of the bone. The head is a large hemispherical articular elevation, directed inwai-ds, upwards, and somewhat backwards. The necTc, as described by anatomists, is the ring of bone which supports the head; inferiorly, it passes into the shaft; superiorly, it is a mere groove between the head and the great tuberosity. The neclc, as often described by sur- geons, is the part of the shaft immediately below the tuberosities. The great tuberosity is a thick projection, continued upwards from the external part of the shaft, and reaching neai'ly to the level of the upper margin of the head ; it is sur- mounted by three fiat surfaces, the uppermost of which gives attachment to the supra-spinatus muscle, the lowest to the teres minor, and the intermediate one to the infra-spinatus muscle. Separated from the great tuberosity by the com- mencement of the bicipital groove, the small tuberosity, rounded and prominent, looks directly forwards and gives attachment to the subscapxdaris muscle.

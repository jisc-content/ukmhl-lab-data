The synovial membrane, sometimes called from its looseness membrana sacci- formis, extends partly upwards between the radius and ulua, partly horizontally inwards Fig. 128. between the ulna and triangular fibro-carti- lage. A^^len the fibro-cartilage is perforated, as is occasionally the case, this synovial mem- brane is contiauous with that of the wrist joint.

The interosseous mem- brane or ligamentof the forearm is a thin, flat, fibrous membrane, the direction of whose fibres is for the most part ob- liquely downwards and inwards, and which extends between the contiguous borders of Fig. 129.—A, Front, and B, Back view op the Articulations op the Forearm, Wrist and Hand. ^ 1, the internal lateral ligament of the elbow joint; 2, the external lateral; 3, the anterior ; 4, points to the posterior ; 5, orbicular ligament of the radius ; 6, interosseous membrane; 7, oblique or round ligament; 8, internal lateral ligament of the wrist; 9, external; 10, anterior; 11, posterior ; 12, palmar, and 13, dorsal carpo - metacarpal liga- ments ; 14, ligaments con- necting metacarpal bones; 15, transverse metacarpal ligament; 16, carpo-meta- carpal ligament of the thumb; 17, lateral liga- ments connecting the pha- langeal with the metacarpal bones; 18, lateral ligaments of the phalanges.

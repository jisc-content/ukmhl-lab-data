CoMPiEXTTS AND TRANSVERSO-SPiSTALES.—The muscles of the complicated group comprising the complexus, semispinalis, and multifidus spince., present the feature in common of ascending with an inward inclination, and are thus distinguished from those last described. The most superficial, the complexus, not usually included ia this group, but obviously resembUng the others, has the longest and most vertical fibres, but is the shortest as a whole, being limited to the upper dorsal and the cervical region ; the muscle beneath it, the semispinalis, occupies the greater part of both these regions ; while the multifidus spina}, extending from the sacrum to the axis, has the shortest and most oblique fibres. The complexus {complexus major) arises by tendinous points from the transverse processes of the seven highest dorsal and seventh cervical vertebrae, and from the articular processes of three other cervical vertebrte, together with the capsular ligament uniting them ; and it is inserted into the large internal impression between the two curved lines of the occij)ital bone. It is narrower above than below, and its inner margin in the neck is in contact with the Ugamentum nuchie. Above the middle the muscle is partly crossed by a tendinous intersection. One interrupting tendon in particular, on the inner side, is so constant that the fibres connected with it, viz., those ascend- ing from the three or four lowest points of origin, are often described sepa- rately, under the name of biventer cervicis: this portion of the muscle is also frequently connected by a tendinous slip with one or two of the spinous processes belonging to the last cervical or first dorsal vertebra. The complexus muscle is covered by the splcnius, except at its lowest origins from the dorsal vertebrae and at the internal portion of its upper extremity; the trans- vcrsalis cervicis and trachelo-mastoid rest upon its scries of origins, and the semi- spinalis colli, the posterior recti, and the obliqui capitis, together with the deep cervical artery, are concealed by it. The semisjnnalis muscle consists of fibres extending from transverse processes to spines, each bundle crossing over about five vertebras. It arises from the internal tubercles of the transverse processes of numerous dorsal vertebr£e, usually the ten highest, and is inserted into spines from the axis to the fourth dorsal vertebra inclusive. It is described iu two parts :— a. The semispinalis colli ia the part under cover of the complexus. It arises from the upper five or six dorsal transverse processes, and is inserted into spmes of cervical vertebrsQ from the second to the fifth inclusive being thickest at its insertion into the second vertebra.

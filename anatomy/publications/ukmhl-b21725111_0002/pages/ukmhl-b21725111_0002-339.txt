277 ADDUCTOll MUSCLES. margin of tlio liuea aspera in its whole length, between the vastus in- tcnius and the adductor magnus. Fig. 212.â€”SuPEKFiciAL Muscles op THE Inxer Side of tue Thigh, AND Muscles on the Inker Wall OP THE Pelvis, 1, iliacus muscle; 2, part of the psoas magnus muscle; 3, obturator internus, with its fibres converging to- wards the lesser sciatic foramen; 4, pyriforrais, with three heads of origin, and its fibres converging towards the great sciatic foramen ; 5, a part of the lumbar aponeurosis covering the erector spinte muscle; 6, gluteus maximus; 7, sartorius, 7', its tendon inserted below the tuberosity of the tibia; 8, a partof the adductor longus ; 9, gracilis, 9', its insertion passing below that of the sartorius; 10, part of the adductor magnus; 11, semimembranosus; 12, semitendinosus, 12', its insertion, and between 9' and 12' tiie tendon of the semimembranosus passing to its in- sertion in the inner tuberosity of the tibia. This muscle is covered by the fascia lata, the sartorius, and the femoral vessels ; the posterior surface rests superiorly on the adductor brevis, and inferiorly on the adductor mag- nus. Externally it is separated by a small interval from the pectineus, and internally it is in apposition with the gracilis. The adductor brevis, thick above and broad beloTV, arises by a narrow origin, about two inches deep, in contact with that of the gracilis, from the anterior surface of the body, and the descending ramus of the pubes; directed obliquely backwards and outwards it is inserted by a flat tendon into the whole of the oblique line leading from the small trochanter of the femur to the linea aspera, immediately beliind the insertion of the pec- tineus. Fig. 21-2, Tlie adductor brevis k concealed at its origin by the adductor longus and at its insertion in part by the pectineus; it rests on the adductor magnus, and by its deep surface is in contact superiorly with the obturator extcrnus. The adductor magmts musclo arises from a part of tho body of the pubes

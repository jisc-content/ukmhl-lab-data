BONES OF THE HEAD. 32 THE PARIETAL BONE. The parietal bones form a principal part of the roof of the skull. They have the shape of quadrilateral plates, convex externally, concave internally. They are a little broader above than below, and the anterior inferior angle is the most acute. They articulate with one another in the middle line, with the frontal bone anteriorly, the occipital posteriorly, and the temporal and sphenoid below. Fig. 28.

Posterior snperior .angle ; 2, anterior superior angle ; 3, posterior inferior angle ; 4, ante- rior inferior angle ; from 1 to 2, superior border in the sagittal suture ; from 2 to 4, anterior bonier in the coronal suture; from 1 to 3, posterior border in the lambdoidal suture; from 4 to 6, the part of the inferior border in the squamous suture; from 3 to 6, the part in the ad- ditamentum suturaj squaraos.'E ; 5, the temporal or semicircular line above which is the parietal eminence. On the outer surface, the point of greatest convexity is called the parietal emi- nence. Below this a curved line is directed from the anterior to the lower part of the posterior margia ; it is the parietal part of the temporal ridge, and bounds a surface somewhat flatter than the rest, planum temjporale, which forms part of the tempo- ? ral fossa. ISTear the pos- vr^fwjWifyy^j terior and upper angle, w^UtiMi^t&hnnr,. 1 close to the middle line, there is often a small perforation of variable dimensions, the ^ja7"iefaJ foramen, which tnms- mits a communicating vein.

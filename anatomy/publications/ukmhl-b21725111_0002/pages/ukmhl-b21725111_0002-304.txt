MUSCLES OF THE THOllAX. 242 descend, and each is inserted into tlie outer surface of the rib beloncing to tlie_ vertebra below that from which it springs. The levator muscles Deiongmg to the lower ribs present some longer additional fibres which passing over one rib, are inserted into the next one below ; these fibres are sometimes distinguished as levatores longiores costarum.

ARTICULATIONS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. 127 Fie 116—Transverse Section similar to THAT represented IN FlO 113, WITH A SMALLER PORTION OP THE OCCIPITAL BoNE, THE Crucial Ligaments beinq remoyeu. 4 alar or odontoid ligament; 5, accessory atlanto-axial ligament; C, 7, cfPf''^i' liga- ments of the occipito-atlantal and the atlanto- axial articulations ; 9, placed on the head of the odontoid process ; 9, 9', superior or median occipito-odontoid ligament. The ligamentum suspensorium dentis or middle odontoid ligament consists of fibres which pass directly upwards from the summit of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum. Fig. 116.

J A, the lower part of the skull sawn transversely through the basilar process, with the atlas and axis, viewed from before. 1, the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament; 2, the middle thickened part or accessory occipito-atlantal ligament; 3, the anterior atlanto- axial ligament.

190 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. leading from the mouth to the pharynx, is called the isthmus of the fauces. The soft palate is acted on by five pairs of elongated muscles, two superior^ one in the middle, and two inferior. Of the two inferior pairs of muscles', one is common to the palate and tongue, the otlier to the palate and pharynx. ^ The palato-glossus or constrictor istlimi faucium occupies the anterior pillar of the fauces. Superiorly it is anterior to all the other muscles of the velum, and its fibres are continuous with those of its fellow of the opposite side ; inferiorly, it is lost on the side of the tongue.

The palato-pharyiigeiis, occupying the posterior pillar of the pharynx, arises in the soft palate by fibres connected with those of the opposite side, and passing partly above and partly below the levator palati and azygos muscles. As the muscle descends it becomes greatly expanded, and its fibres are found extended from the posterior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, back to the middle line of the pharynx posteriorly. The azygos uvulce (Morgagni), so called from having been supposed to be a single muscle, consists of two slips arising, one on each side of the middle line, from the tendinous structure of the soft palate, and, sometimes, from the spine of the palate-plate, and descending into the uvida. The two slips are separated by a slight interval above, and unite as they descend. The levator palati arises from the extremity of tlie petrous portion of the temporal bone, in front of the orifice of the carotid canal, and from the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube.

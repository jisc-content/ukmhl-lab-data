ARTICULATIONS. 317 of the anterior aspect of the knee-joint. The internal popliteal nerve furnishes the knee-joint with superior and inferior internal articular and azygos articular nerves, which accompany the arteries of the same name. The branch from the obturator nerve descends on the posterior aspect of the popliteal artery as far as the back of the knee-joint. At this point it leaves the artery and, inclining forwards, breaks up into several filaments which separately pierce the posterior ligament. ARTICULATIONS. The dissection of the knee-joint, the ankle-joint, the tibio- fibular joints, and the various articulations of the foot, may now be proceeded with. It is possible that the ligaments may have become hard and dry. If this be the case, soak the joints in water for an hour or two. Knee-joint.—In this joint three bones are in apposition, viz., the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia, and the patella. It is the largest and most complicated articulation in the body ; and if the bones be examined in the skeleton, the joint presents an apparent insecurity, because the bony surfaces show little adaptation the one to the other. In reality, however, it is very strong, and very rarely suffers dislocation on account of the strength of the ligaments which retain the bones in place. The ligaments on the exterior of the knee-joint are :— 1. The capsular ligament. 2. Two lateral ligaments—external and internal. 3. The ligamentum patella (or anterior ligament). 4. The posterior ligament. Dissection.—The popliteal vessels and nerves, and the muscles sur- rounding the knee-joint, must be removed. Portions of the tendons ol the biceps, semimembranosus, sartorius, semitendinosus, gracilis, and popliteus, together with small pieces of the heads of the gastrocnemius, should be left in place in order that their connection with the ligaments

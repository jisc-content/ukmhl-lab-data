THE LOWER LIMB. 280 pass under cover of the ligament. They lie between the extensor longus hallucis and the extensor longus digit- orum. PERONEAL REGION. The peroneal or outer compartment of the leg should now be opened by dividing, in a longitudinal direction, the fascia which covers it. Enclosed within it are :â€” 1. The peroneus longus. 2. The peroneus brevis. 3. The termination of the external popliteal nerve. 4. The musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Peroneus Longus arises from the head and from the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula in its upper two- thirds. A surface of origin is also afforded to it by the fascia which covers it, and by the two peroneal inter- muscular septa. It ends a short distance above the ankle in a long tendon, which is continued downwards behind the external malleolus. Gaining the outer margin of the foot, it proceeds forwards to the groove on the under surface of the cuboid, which conducts it transversely into the sole. Its insertion will be examined at a later period. The Peroneus Brevis arises from the lower two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula, below and in front of the peroneus longus, and from the peroneal intermuscular septum on either side of it. Its tendon descends behind the external malleolus, and then turns forwards on the outer surface of the os calcis to gain an insertion into the projecting base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe.1 On the back of the external malleolus 1 A small tendinous slip will, as a general rule, be observed to pro- ceed forwards from the tendon of the peroneus brevis to join the tendon of the long extensor on the dorsum of the little toe. This is the peroneus quinti digili.

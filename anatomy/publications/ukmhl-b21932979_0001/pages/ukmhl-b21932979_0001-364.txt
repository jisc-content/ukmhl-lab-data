340 THE LOWER LIMB. the external calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, but the interos- seous and plantar ligaments may be readily displayed. The cuboid, by an oval facet on its inner surface, articu- lates with the external cuneiform bone. Interosseous, dorsal, and plantar ligaments bind them together. By dividing the dorsal ligament and insinuating the knife between the two bones the interosseous ligament may be detected. It is the strongest of the three ligaments. The synovial membrane which lines the scapho-cuneiform articulation is prolonged into the cubo-cuneiform joint and also into the scapho-cuboid joint when this exists. Tarso-metatarsal Articulations.â€”The bases of the five metatarsal bones articulate with the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid bone, and are very firmly attached to them by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal ligaments are flat distinct bands which can readily be defined. One such ligament passes to the base of the first metatarsal from the internal cuneiform ; three, one from each of the cuneiform bones, proceed to the base of the second metatarsal; one extends from the external cuneiform to the base of the third metatarsal; two, of which one proceeds from the external cuneiform, and the other from the cuboid, go to the base of the fourth metatarsal; and one passes from the cuboid to the base of the fifth metatarsal. The plantar ligaments are not so regularly disposed. Those in connection with the first and second metatarsal bones are very strong. Some of the bands have an oblique direction, and those which go to the bases of the three middle metatarsal bones are more or less connected with the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and there- fore with the long plantar ligament. To bring the interosseous ligaments into view, divide freely the dorsal ligaments, and then forcibly bend the metatarsus downwards upon the tarsus. The interosseous ligaments will resist this proceeding, and on looking into the joints

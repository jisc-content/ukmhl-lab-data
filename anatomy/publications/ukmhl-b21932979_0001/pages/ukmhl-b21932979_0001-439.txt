ABDOMINAL WALL. 415 the body), a small gap or interval is seen to exist between the lower arched border of the transversalis muscle and Poupart's ligament. The membrane which fills up this interval is the transversalis fascia. At no part of the abdominal wall is the fascia stronger than here, and this accession of strength is obviously for the purpose of com- pensating for the deficiency in the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, which, at this point, do not descend so low as Poupart's ligament. In this interval the transver- salis fascia has an important relation to the spermatic cord. Here the fascia is pierced by the cord, but as yet no opening is visible. Take hold of the cord and draw it downwards and inwards. The margins of the aperture through which it passes will be observed to be prolonged downwards upon the cord in a funnel-shaped manner, so as to invest it upon all sides with a tube of fascia. This investment, which is thus seen to come directly from the fascia transversalis, is called the infundibuliform or i?iternal spermatic fascia. Dissection.—It must now become the object of the dissector to demonstrate the more important attachments of this fascia. For this purpose divide the fibres of the transversalis muscle along the outer part of Poupart's ligament and along the crest of the ilium, and, raising the muscle from the subjacent fascia, throw it upwards. It is not necessary to reflect the entire muscle. Attachments of the Fascia Transversalis.—When the fascia is cleaned with the handle of the scalpel, it will be seen to be attached laterally to the inner lip of the iliac crest. Along the line of this attachment, which is by no means firm, it becomes continuous with the internal oblique, transversalis. fascia transversalis. external oblique. Fig. 84.

THE UPPER LIMB. 132 proximal phalanx of the little finger. It is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The flexor brevis minimi digiti is composed of a single fleshy belly which springs from the hook of the unciform bone and the annular ligament, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of the little finger, in common with the abductor. This muscle is sometimes much reduced in size, and frequently more or less com- pletely incorporated with the opponens. Its nerve supply comes from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The opponens minimi digiti arises from the annular liga- ment, and the hook of the unciform bone and its fibres spread out to obtain insertion into the entire length of the ulnar margin of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. The deep branch of the ulnar gives it its nerve of supply. The Deep Branch of the Ulnar Nerve springs from the parent trunk on the anterior aspect of the annular ligament, and gives off a branch which supplies the three short muscles of the little finger. Accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar artery, it then sinks into the interval between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, and turns outwards across the palm under cover of the flexor tendons. Near the radial border of the palm the deep branch of the ulnar nerve breaks up into terminal twigs, which supply the adductor transversus pollicis, the adductor obliquus pollicis, and the first dorsal interosseous muscle. In its course across the palm it lies along the concavity or upper border of the deep palmar arch, and sends three fine branches forwards in front of the three interosseous spaces. These supply the interosseous muscles in those spaces, while the two inner also give branches to the deep surfaces of the two inner lumbrical muscles.1 1 The third lumbrical has frequently a double nerve supply, as it is not uncommon to find a second twig from the median entering its superficial aspect.

452 ABDOMEN. anterior sharp margin of the liver. The apex of this triangular area points to the left, and corresponds with the left extremity of the organ. The greater part of the anterior surface lies against the diaphragm, and under cover of the lower ribs and costal cartilages of the right side. Its left part lies under shelter of the costal arches of the left side; whilst in the ^-shaped interval between the costal cartilages of opposite sides it lies behind the ensiform cartilage, and, for coronary ligament left lateraV ligament.

Attached to the anterior and superior surfaces of the liver will be seen the broad peritoneal falciform ligament which maps out the organ into a right and a left lobe. The smooth glossy appearance of the three surfaces we have examined is due to the peritoneal investment of the organ. If the hand be passed backwards over the upper surface of the liver, its posterior surface will be observed to be in

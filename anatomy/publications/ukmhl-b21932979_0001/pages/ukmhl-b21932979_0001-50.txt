20 THE UPPER LIMB. The posterior wall of the axilla is somewhat longer than the anterior wall. It is formed from above downwards by the subscapularis muscle, the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and the teres major muscle. The subscapularis, lying upon the venter of the scapula, takes by far the largest share in the formation of this boundary. The narrow tendon of the latissimus dorsi lies in front of the teres major, so that only a very small part of the latter muscle is seen below it. The posterior fold of the axilla is formed by the lower border of this wall. The inner wall is constituted by the upper four or five Fig. 6.â€”Diagram of Section through the Axilla of the Left side. ribs with the intervening intercostal muscles; it is clothed by the corresponding digitations of the serratus magnus muscle. The outer wall is formed by the humerus and the con- joined origin of the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps. The apex of the space corresponds with the narrow com- munication between the axilla and the root of the neck. It is a triangular interval (which can readily be investigated by the finger when the space is dissected) bounded by the 1. Upper end of humerus. 2. Scapula. 3. Rib. 4. Pectoralis major. 5.

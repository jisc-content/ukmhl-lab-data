423 ABDOMINAL WALL. But these two scrotal tunics are not the only coverings of the testicle. Each constituent of the abdominal wall has been seen to contribute an investment to the spermatic cord, and these in turn are continued down so as to clothe the testicle. Presuming, then, that the skin and superficial fascia are reflected, the testicle and cord within the scrotum will still be found to be invested by— 1. The external spermatic or intercolumnar fascia from the aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremasteric fascia—the muscular element of which is partly derived from the internal oblique. 3. The infundibuliform fascia from the fascia transversalis. The dissector will find it difficult to demonstrate in every case these different investments of the testicle. In cases of large hernia; of old standing, however, they become thickened, and are more readily recognisable. From the above description the student will understand that there is only one tunic common to both testicles—viz., the integument; that the superficial fascia and dartos, and the investments derived from the abdominal wall, constitute special tunics for each testicle. Spermatic Cord.—The spermatic cord has been traced in its course through the inguinal canal, and has been observed to issue from it through the external abdominal ring. It is now seen as it lies within the scrotum suspend- ing the testicle. Before dissecting out the constituent parts of the cord, examine the extra-peritoneal fatty tissue which lies behind the internal abdominal ring.

Behind the internal abdominal ring the peritoneum shows a slight bulging forwards, and a slender fibrous band may be detected passing into the cord from the most prominent part of this bulging. This fibrous cord is the remains of the tube of

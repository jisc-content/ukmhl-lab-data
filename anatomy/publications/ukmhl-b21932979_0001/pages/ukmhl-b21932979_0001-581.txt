549 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. is in great part covered by the inferior vena cava, and on both sides the lumbar vessels pass outwards behind it. As a general rule, a small oval ganglion is formed upon the body of each lumbar vertebra. An external and an in- ternal series of branches will be observed to spring from these ganglia. The external branches connect the ganglia with the anterior primary divisions of the lumbar spinal nerves. Two will be found accompanying each lumbar artery. Trace them carefully backwards by cutting through the fibrous arches which bridge over these vessels, and scraping away the fibres of the psoas muscle. They join the lumbar nerves close to the intervertebral foramina. The internal branches are chiefly given to the aortic plexus, but some will be found passing downwards in front of the common iliac artery to join the hypogastric plexus. Several twigs are also given to the vertebrae and their ligaments. Dissection.—To bring the anterior primary divisions of the lumbar nerves into view, it is necessary to scrape away the psoas muscle. This has already been partially done in following the connecting sympa- thetic twigs backwards. An occasional branch, the accessory obturator, is liable to injury unless it be secured at once. When present, it will be found descending along the inner border of the psoas. Lumbar Nerves.—The anterior primary divisions of the lumbar nerves are five in number, and pass outwards in the substance of the psoas muscle. They increase in size from above downwards, and each nerve is joined by two twigs from the sympathetic cord. Branches are given by them to the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The first three lumbar nerves, with a part of the fourth, unite in a loop-like manner to form the lumbar plexus, whilst the remaining part of the fourth joins the fifth to form the lumbosacral cord. Lumbar Plexus.—This plexus is placed in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra in the substance

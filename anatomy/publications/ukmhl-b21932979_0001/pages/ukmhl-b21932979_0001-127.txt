FOREARM AND HAND. i°3 forearm, viz., the flexor profundus digitorum in relation to the ulna, the flexor longus pollicis in relation to the radius, and the pronator quadratus closely applied to the lower ends of both bones. Dissection.—The superficial group of muscles should now be dis- sected. The supinator longus, which lies along the outer side of the forearm, may be cleaned at the same time. In the lower part of the forearm the dissector will observe that the flexor tendons are enveloped by a loose bursal sac as they pass into the palm, under cover of the anterior annular ligament. A good view of this may be obtained by pulling the tendons upwards. If possible, the sac should be retained uninjured, in order that its full extent may be studied when the palm of the hand is opened up. At this stage it is also well to define the anterior annular ligament which bridges across the front of the carpus. The tendon of the palmaris longus passes in front of it, whilst close to the pisiform bone the ulnar artery and nerve are placed upon its anterior surface, and give the dissector the key to its depth. This vessel, with its accompanying nerve, are bound down to the ligament by a slip of fascia, which passes over them from the pisiform bone, and which the student is very apt to mistake for the annular ligament itself. This should not be disturbed in the meantime. Common Origin of the Superficial Muscles.—The five muscles which constitute the superficial group are very closely associated with each other at the elbow—indeed they may be said to arise by a common origin from the front of the internal condyle of the humerus. In addition to this they all derive fibres from the investing deep fascia of the limb near the elbow, and the strong fibrous septa which pass into the forearm from the deep surface of this in the intervals between them. The pronator radii teres, the flexor sublimis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris, have likewise additional heads of origin. The Pronator Radii Teres crosses obliquely the upper half of the front of the forearm. It arises by two heads, viz., a humeral and a coronoid. The humeral head con- stitutes the chief bulk of the muscle, and it springs from the upper part of the internal condyle of the humerus, and also slightly by fleshy fibres from the lower part of the

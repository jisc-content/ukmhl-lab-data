63 FRONT OF THE ARM. that it inclines backwards as well as inwards. In a well developed arm, when fully extended, the external condyle does not form a projection on the surface, but can be felt at the bottom of a slight depression on the posterior aspect of the limb. It becomes apparent to the eye as a promi- nence when the elbow is semi-flexed. The olecranon pro- cess of the ulna produces a marked projection on the back of the elbow between the two condyles. It is placed slightly nearer to the internal than to the external condyle. This is Fig. 15.—Posterior view of the upper limb, with the elbow- joint fully extended (Luschka). 1. Humerus. 2. Ulna. 3. Radius. Fig. 16.—Posterior view of the upper limb, with the elbow- joint flexed (Luschka). 1. Humerus. 2. Ulna. 3. Radius. more especially the case in children—an important practical point, seeing that in the young injuries of the elbow are particularly common. The loose skin which covers the olecranon moves freely over its subcutaneous surface, owing to the interposition of a synovial bursa. The different positions which are assumed by the olecranon, in relation to the condyles of the humerus in the movements of the forearm at the elbow joint, must be carefully studied and considered. This can best be done by placing the thumb

ABDOMEN. 6l2 detect the opening in the urethral floor. He will notice that the ducts proceed in the first place through the erectile tissue of the bulb, but towards their termination they lie immediately subjacent to the mucous membrane. The walls of the urethra are always in apposition except when urine is flowing through it. A transverse section through the spongy portion, except at its anterior part, would give the appearance of a transverse slit. In the fossa navicularis, however, the slit becomes vertical. Mucous Membrane of the Urethra.—The mucous lining of the urethra is continuous posteriorly with that of the bladder, and anteriorly with the integument covering the glans penis. It is likewise continuous with the mucous membrane which lines the various ducts which open into the urethra. It is everywhere studded with the mouths of minute recesses, called lacuna. These are particularly plentiful on the floor of the spongy part, and, as a general rule, they are directed forwards towards the meatus urinarius. One recess, specially deserving the attention of the student on account of its large size, is called the lacuna magna; it is placed on the roof of the fossa navicularis. Its orifice in rare cases is large enough to admit the point of a small bougie or catheter. Direction of the Urethral Canal.—The prostatic portion is directed downwards and very slightly forwards; the membranous part describes a slight curve behind the sym- physis, the concavity of which looks forwards ; whilst the spongy part at first ascends, and then curves downwards. The urethra, therefore, in the flaccid condition of the penis, takes a course in which there are two curves, like the letter CO reversed. In the erect condition of the penis the curve in the spongy part of the canal is obliterated, and there is now only one curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. Structure of the Prostate.—In the course of an ordinary dissection it is hardly to be expected that the dissector will

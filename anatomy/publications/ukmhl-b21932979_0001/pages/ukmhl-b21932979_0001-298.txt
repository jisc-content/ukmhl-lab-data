THE LOWER LIMB. 274 of its course it lies close to the inner side of the neck of the fibula, and appears in the present dissection immediately below the outer tuberosity of the tibia. On the front of the leg it takes a straight course downwards to the ankle-joint. Here it reaches the dorsum of the foot, and receives the name of dorsalis pedis. In the upper two-thirds of the leg the anterior tibial artery is very deeply placed. It lies upon the interosseous membrane in the interval between the tibialis anticus on the inner side, and the extensor longus digitorum and the extensor longus hallucis on the outer side. In the lower third of the leg where the muscles give place to their tendons the artery comes nearer to the surface. In this part of its course it rests upon the tibia and is overlapped on the outer side by the extensor longus hallucis. Imme- diately above the ankle-joint the tendon of that muscle crosses the artery and comes to lie on its inner side. Two vence comites closely accompany the anterior tibial artery, and send short communicating branches both in front of it and behind it. The a?iterior tibial nerve is also intimately related to it. It joins the artery a short distance below the knee and soon takes up a position in front of the vessel. Near the ankle-joint the nerve as a rule assumes a place on the outer side of the artery. On the front of the leg the anterior tibial artery gives off the following branches :â€” 1. Muscular. 2. Anterior tibial recurrent. 3. External malleolar. 4. Internal malleolar. The muscular branches are numerous and come off at irregular points along the whole length of the artery. They supply the muscles on the front of the leg. The Anterior Recurrent Tibial Artery springs from the anterior tibial immediately after it reaches the front of the leg. It turns upwards on the external tuberosity of the tibia in the fibres of the tibialis anticus muscle. Its terminal

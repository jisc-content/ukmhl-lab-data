On account of this, the body of the penis has a somewhat prismatic form. The corpus spongiosum is traversed throughout its whole extent by the urethra. If these three constituents of the body of the penis be traced backwards, the student will observe that opposite the lower part of the symphysis pubis they separate from each other and become attached to parts in the superficial area of Fig. 67.â€”Diagram of ihe three parts of the penis, and their relation to the pubic arch and the triangular ligament. T. Triangular ligament. the urethral triangle. The corpora cavernosa diverge widely from each other, and now they receive the name of the crura of the penis. Each crus is fixed firmly to the corresponding side of the pubic arch by an attachment which extends from the sub-pubic ligament backwards to the tuberosity of the ischium. Close to the point where it becomes continuous with the corresponding corpus cavernosum it shows a slight dilatation or bulging; from this to its posterior extremity it gradually tapers away. The corpus spongiosum is continued

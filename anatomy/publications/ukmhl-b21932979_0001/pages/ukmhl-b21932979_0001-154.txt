ISO THE UPPER LIMB. nerve are now exposed, and a favourable opportunity is given for study- ing the short muscles of the thumb and little finger. Short Muscles of the Thumb.â€”The abductorpollicis forms the most prominent and external part of the ball of the thumb. The superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis lies immediately to the inner side of the abductor, and by sepa- rating the one from the other, the oppoimis pollicis will be exposed. These three muscles lie to the outer side of the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. To the inner side of this tendon, and placed deeply in the palm, is a fan-shaped muscular sheet imperfectly separated into an upper and lower part by the radial artery as it enters the palm. The upper muscle is the adductor obliquus pollicis (deep head of flexor brevis pollicis of certain English text-books); the lower muscle is the adductor transversuspollicis (the adductor pollicis of certain English text-books). In dissecting these muscles the muscular branch of the median nerve must be traced to those which lie upon the outer side of the long flexor tendon of the thumb, and the deep branch of the ulnar must be followed, and its branches to the two adductors of the thumb secured. The abductor pollicis arises from the front of the annular ligament and the trapezium. It is inserted into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and slightly into the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the first phalanx. Its nerve of supply comes from the median. The superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis1 takes origin from the annular ligament, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is supplied by the median nerve. The opponens pollicis springs from the annular ligament 1 The term superficial heady applied to this muscle, suggests the presence of a deep head. Such a head is present. It is the interosseous primus volaris of Henle (v. p. 151)-

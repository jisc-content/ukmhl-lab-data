POPLITEAL SPACE' 195 Below, the space is bounded by the converging heads of the gastrocnemius. In the formation of the lower and outer boundary, the outer head of the gastrocnemius will be seen to be assisted by the" small plantaris muscle. The diamond-shaped space on the back of the knee-joint, which is brought into view by dissection, differs widely from the condition which is observed when transverse sections are made through this part of the frozen limb.

The space in this condition is rather under an inch wide at its broadest part. The popliteal artery, therefore, which traverses the space, is covered by muscles throughout its whole course, with the exception of a very small part immediately above the knee-joint.

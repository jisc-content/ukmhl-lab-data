ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 445 -SUBCOSTAL PLANE Subdivision of the Abdominal Cavity.—In dealing with so large a cavity, and one which contains such a diversity of contents, it is absolutely necessary for anatomists to sub- divide it into regions, in order that the precise position of each viscus may be accurately defined. In making the first subdivision, we take advantage of the brim of the true pelvis. That part of the cavity which is situ- ated above this is termed the abdomen proper ; whilst that part which lies be- low it is called the pelvic cavity. These two portions of the general abdo- minal cavity do not lie the one directly over the other. The long axis of the ab- domen proper is very nearly vertical; that of the pelvic cavity is very oblique, and directed backwards and downwards. In- deed, the pelvic cavity presents the appearance of a re- cess leading back- wards and downwards from the lower and back part of the abdominal cavity (Fig. 91). The abdomen proper is still further subdivided by means of four arbitrary planes of section. Two of these are supposed to pass through the body in a horizontal direction, and two in a vertical direction. The former are termed the INTERTUQERCULAR PLANE LINE OF PELVIC BRIM \ Fig. 91.—Outline of the abdominal cavity as seen in mesial section. The planes of subdivision are indicated by dotted lines.

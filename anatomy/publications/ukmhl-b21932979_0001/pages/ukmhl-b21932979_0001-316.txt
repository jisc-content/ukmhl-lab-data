292 THE LOWER LIMB. rests upon the interosseous membrane upon a deeper plane and between the fleshy bellies of the two flexors. The Aponeurosis covering the Tibialis Posticus is the second partition which crosses the posterior osteo-fascial compartment of the leg. It is a strong aponeurosis, which is attached on the one hand to the internal border of the fibula, and on the other to the vertical ridge which descends from the oblique line on the posterior surface of the tibia. To demonstrate these attachments, the flexor muscle of the toes must be pushed inwards and some of its fibres divided. The flexor longus hallucis must in like manner be pushed outwards. The aponeurosis will then be seen to serve as a surface of origin for both of these muscles ; and, on its removal, it will also be observed to give fibres by its deep surface to the subjacent tibialis posticus. The Popliteus arises by a stout narrow tendon, within the capsule of the knee-joint, from the front of the popliteal groove on the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur. The fleshy fibres are directed inwards and down- wards, and spread out to obtain insertion into the posterior surface of the tibia above the oblique line, and also into the aponeurosis which covers the muscle. The nerve to the popliteus has already been seen to arise from the internal popliteal trunk. It can now be seen hooking round the lower margin of the muscle to reach its deep surface. The Flexor Longus Hallucis is a powerful muscle which arises from the posterior surface of the fibula below the origin of the soleus, from the posterior peroneal septum, and from the surface of the aponeurosis covering the tibialis posticus. Its tendon occupies a deep groove on the posterior border of the astragalus, and turns forwards under cover of the internal annular ligament to gain the sole of the foot. The Flexor Longus Digitorum arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia below the popliteus, and

ABDOMEN. 642 pelvis (p. 593). Of course there is no prostatic plexus of veins in the female, and therefore the dorsal vein of the clitoris joins the vesical plexus. Both the vagina and uterus are surrounded by large tortuous veins, constituting a vaginal and a uterine plexus. From the former, the blood is drained away into the in- ternal iliac vein, whilst from the uterine plexus it is chiefly carried away by the ovarian veins. Pelvic Diaphragm. This is described at p. 594. The dissector should note, however, that the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle, which in the male are connected with the prostate, pass downwards upon the lateral aspect of the vagina and give it support (Fig. 144). Nerves of the Pelvis. Very little requires to be added to what has already been said regarding the nerves of the male pelvis (p. 595). There is no prostatic plexus; but a vaginal plexus, an ovarian plexus, and numerous uterine nerves are present in addition to those mentioned in the male. The uterine nerves proceed from the pelvic plexus, before it is joined by the twigs from the third and fourth sacral nerves. They ascend between the two layers of the lateral ligament along with the uterine artery, but, in their distribu- tion to the uterus, they do not rigorously accompany the branches of this vessel. The vaginal plexus is an offset from the pelvic plexus, and the nerves which compose it are not plexiform in their arrangement. The ovarian plexus is derived from the aortic and renal

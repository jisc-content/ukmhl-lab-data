593 PEL VIS. pierce the muscular coat and continue downwards, sub- jacent to the mucous membrane, and at the anus they end in a series of anastomosing loops. The superior hsemor- rhoidal anastomoses freely with both the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal arteries. Middle Sacral Artery (arteria sacralis media).—The middle sacral has already been observed springing from the posterior aspect of the termination of the abdominal aorta, between the two common iliac arteries. It runs downwards upon the body of the last lumbar vertebra and under cover of the left common iliac vein. Reaching the sacrum, it continues its downward course in the mesial plane till it arrives at the coccyx. Here it ends by anastomosing with the lateral sacral arteries, and by sending minute branches to the coccygeal body. From each side it gives off small twigs, which ramify upon the anterior aspect of the sacrum and inosculate with branches of the lateral sacral arteries. Veins of the Pelvis.—The arrangement of the veins in the pelvis corresponds in a great measure with that of the arteries; still there are some important points of difference, viz. :— (i.) The dorsal vein of the penis, instead of joining the pudic vein, proceeds backwards, divides into two, and enters the prostatic plexus of veins. (2.) The ilio-lumbar and the middle sacral veins, as a general rule, pour their blood into the common iliac veins. (3.) The veins around the prostate, bladder, and lower end of the rectum are exceedingly large and numerous, and constitute dense plexuses, which freely communicate with each other. The prostatic and vesical plexuses have already been noticed. They are directly continuous, and the blood is drained from them by the vesical veins. The hemor- rhoidal plexus surrounds the lower third of the rectum subjacent to the mucous membrane. From this the blood is drained away by three different veins—viz., the inferior hemorrhoidal, which carries it to the pudic vein ; the middle vol. 1.—38

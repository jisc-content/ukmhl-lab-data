ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 525 stituents, but these can only be made out by the aid of the microscope. The Kidneys.—The kidneys are situated behind the peritoneum, against the posterior wall of the abdomen—one on either side of the vertebral column. They are enveloped by a capsule of loose areolar tissue, the meshes of which are at certain points loaded with soft pliable fat. Clear this away, and be careful not to remove at the same time the suprarenal body, which lies upon the upper end of each kidney. The kidney is placed opposite the bodies of the last dorsal and the upper three lumbar vertebrae. It extends from the upper border of the last dorsal vertebra to the middle of the body of the third lumbar vertebra, and it lies obliquely—its upper end being somewhat nearer the mesial plane than its lower end. The kidneys lie for the most part in the hypochondriac and epigastric regions. As a rule the left kidney is entirely confined to these districts; but the right kidney, which occupies a slightly lower level, crosses the subcostal plane so that a small portion of its inferior extremity comes to lie in the right lumbar and the adjoining part of the umbilical region. This difference on the two sides is probably due to the great bulk of the right lobe of the liver. The average length of the kidney is four inches; its breadth two and a-half inches; and its average weight four and a-half ounces in the male, but somewhat less in the female. It is a solid organ, very pliable, and of a brownish- red colour. The form of the kidney is so characteristic that the term "reniform," or "kidney-shaped," has become common in descriptive language. The external surface looks outwards and forwards, and presents impressions corresponding to the viscera in contact with it; whilst the internal surface is directed inwards and backwards towards the side of the vertebral column, and is moulded accurately upon the parts which support it. The extremities are round,

1S1 GLUTEAL REGION. 5. Nerve to the obturator internus. to reach the digital fossa. By dealing similarly with the adjacent margins of the quadratus femoris and the adductor magnus, the small trochanter of the femur will be exposed. Lastly, the origin of the hamstring muscles from the tuber ischii and the upper part of the vastus externus arising from the root of the great trochanter of the femur on its outer aspect should be noted. In each interval formed by the adjacent margins of the muscles exposed, blood-vessels and nerves, or blood-vessels alone, are to be found. Before proceeding to the dissection of these, however, it is well that the student should renew his acquaintance with the skeletal peculiarities of this region. Let him obtain a dried pelvis with the ligaments in situ, and study carefully the position and boundaries of the great and small sciatic notches, and how they are converted into foramina by the small and great sacro-sciatic ligaments. Through these foramina most important structures issue from the interior of the pelvis into the gluteal region. In the interval between the contiguous margins of the gluteus medius and the pyriformis muscles, the gluteal artery and the superior gluteal nerve issue from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. In the interval between the pyriformis and the gemellus superior, two arteries and six nerves must be looked for as they emerge through the lower part of the sacro-sciatic foramen, viz.:â€” Arteries, / '^clatlC- L 2.

The huge great sciatic nerve, together with the sciatic artery and small sciatic nerve, proceed downwards in the hollow between the great trochanter of the femur and the tuber ischii. Nerves,

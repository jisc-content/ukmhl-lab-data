Reflection of Skin.—Incisions—(1.) Along the middle line of the body from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. At the navel the knife should be carried round so as to surround it with a circular incision. (2.) From the ensiform cartilage transversely outwards around the chest, as far back as the knife can be carried. (3.) From the symphysis pubis outwards along the line of Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and then backwards along the crest of the ilium (Fig. 76). The large flap of skin thus mapped out should be carefully raised

Posterior tibial nerve. (Popliteus. Flexor lonsnis hallucis. I lbiahs posticus. Flexor longus digitorum. 9. Internal annular ligament. Reflection of Skin.—The limb must now be placed on its anterior aspect, and the muscles of the calf rendered tense by flexing the foot at the ankle-joint. This position should be maintained by the aid of hooks, fastened to the toes and to the under surface of the table. Incisions.—(1) A longitudinal incision along the middle line of the leg on its posterior aspect to the extremity of the heel. (2) A transverse incision at the lower end of this, extending along the inner and outer margins of the foot for about two inches on either side. The two flaps of skin thus marked out must be raised and turned outwards and inwards. Superficial Veins.—The internal and external saphenous veins must be traced in the substance of the fatty super- ficial fascia. Both of these vessels have been seen in previous steps of the dissection. The internal saphenous vein has been observed to arise from the inner extremity of the venous arch on the dorsum of the foot, and it has been followed upwards for a short distance in front of the inner malleolus, and then upon the inner aspect of the lower part of the tibia. It has also been dissected upon

This fascial tunnel is called Alcock's canal. The student must for the present be satisfied with this partial view of these structures. To expose them would necessitate the division of the parietal pelvic fascia, and this should be kept entire until the pelvic fascia can be studied as a whole. Inferior Hemorrhoidal Vessels and Nerve.—The inferior or external hcemorrhoidal arteries are branches of the internal pudic. They are usually two or three in number, and, piercing the inner wall of Alcock's canal, they pass inwards through the fat of the ischio-rectal fossa to supply the lower end of the rectum and the muscles in connection with it, as well as the skin around the anus. They anastomose with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side, and with branches from the middle and superior hemorrhoidal arteries. They likewise send a few twigs round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, in company with the per- forating cutaneous nerve to supply the skin in the lower part of the buttock. The inferior hcemorrhoidal veins, when they become varicose, give rise to haemorrhoids. The inferior hemorrhoidal nerve accompanies the vessels.

Perforating the inner wall of Alcock's canal, it enters the ischio-rectal fossa, and then it breaks up into muscular, cutaneous, and communicating branches.

It is distributed to the

65 FRONT OF THE ARM. in two large flaps, outwards and inwards. In the fatty superficial fascia, which is then exposed, the superficial structures may be traced. It is well to begin with the nerves, as these are not so apparent, and therefore more liable to injury than the veins. But the dissection of the veins should be carried on concurrently with that of the nerves. Cutaneous Nerves.—These are very numerous, and are derived from several sources. In addition to the two internal cutaneous nerves, and the terminal cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous, which spring from the brachial plexus, there are three branches derived from the musculo-spiral, and one—the intercosto-humeral— from the second intercostal nerve. These seven nerves may be classified into an inner and an outer group as follows :— 1. Upper external cutaneous branch of musculo-spiral, . 2. Lower external cutaneous branch of musculo-spiral, . 3. Cutaneous part of musculo-cuta- neous, . ' . 1. Intercosto-humeral, 2. Internal cutaneous branch of mus- culo-spiral, .... 3. Lesser internal cutaneous, 4. Internal cutaneous, Distributed mainly upon the outer aspect of arm and forearm. Distributed mainly upon the inner aspect of arm and forearm. The two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral pierce the deep fascia about the middle of the outer surface of the upper arm immediately below the insertion of the deltoid, and in close relation to the external inter-muscular septum. The upper and smaller branch appears a short distance above the other. It follows the cephalic vein, and can be traced downwards as far as the elbow. Its filaments are distributed to the skin over the outer and anterior part of the lower half of the upper arm. The larger lower branch can be followed as far as the wrist, and not in- frequently its terminal filaments may even reach the dorsum vol,. 1.—5

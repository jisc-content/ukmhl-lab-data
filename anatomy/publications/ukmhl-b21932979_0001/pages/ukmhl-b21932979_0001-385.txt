MALE PERINEUM, 36i The central point of the perineum.—But what is the central point of the perineum ? It is a tendinous septum situated in the middle line of the body close to the posterior end of the bulb and a short distance in front of the anus. Towards this point, a number of the perineal muscles converge to obtain attachment. On each side it gives attach- ment to the transverse perineal muscles, behind to the sphincter ani, in front to the posterior fibres of the ejaculator urinse, whilst from above the anterior fibres of the levator ani descend to reach its upper aspect. Ejaculator urince, or bulbo-cavernosits.—This muscle is spread over the bulb and posterior part of the corpus spongiosum. It is composed of two symmetrical halves, and its fibres take origin from the central point of the perineum and from a fibrous median raphe which is pro- longed forwards between the two halves of the muscle. The insertion differs according to the point at which the muscle is examined. The posterior fibres are simply attached to the superficial aspect of the anterior triangular ligament; the middle fibres constituting the greater part of the muscle, sweep around the corpus spongiosum so as to invest it completely, and are inserted into a common aponeurosis upon the upper surface of this portion of the penis; lastly, the anterior fibres form two long narrow muscular bands which diverge from each other like the limbs of the letter V> ar>d, passing forwards over the sides of the corpora cavernosa, are inserted into an aponeurosis on the dorsum of the penis. Thus the posterior fibres partially embrace the bulb; the middle fibres embrace the corpus spongiosum ; whilst the anterior fibres embrace the body of the penis. The ejaculator urinse sup- ports the urethra during micturition, and by its contrac- tion it ejects the last drops of urine or semen from the passage. The erector penis or ischio-cavernosus muscle lies upon the crus penis. It arises by fleshy fibres from the inner

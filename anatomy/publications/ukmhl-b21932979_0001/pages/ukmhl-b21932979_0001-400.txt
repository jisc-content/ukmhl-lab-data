The labia majora enclose an elliptical fissure, which is termed the pudendal deft, or the uro-genitalfissure, on account of its containing the apertures of the urethra and vagina. Within this fissure a slightly marked crescentic fold of integument stretching between the hinder parts of the labia majora will be observed. This fold receives the name of the "fourchette" or "frcenulum pudendi." lLU£~u§yi!Jly D^uisdi&iksUabfiuis. Between the fourchette and the entrance to the vagina there is a depression which is known as the fossa navicularis. It may be well for the student to bear in mind that the term "perineum " in the language of the accoucheur is used in a very restricted sense. It is given to the narrow interval which exists between the anus and the fourchette. The Labia Minora or Nymphse represent the male prepuce. They are two pendulous folds of integument which lie within the labia majora. To display them fully the labia majora must be pulled apart. They are placed one on each side of the vaginal orifice. As they proceed forwards they become more prominent, and at the same time converge so as to approximate to each other more closely. Reaching the clitoris, each terminates by splitting into two divisions or folds. The smaller and lower fold is attached to the under surface of the clitoris, and receives the name of frcenulum clitoridis. The upper fold arches over the clitoris like a hood, and unites with the correspond- ing fold of the opposite side to form the preeputium clitoridis. The Clitoris is the homologue of the penis, and, not- withstanding its diminutive proportions, it presents a close resemblance to the male organ both in appearance and structure. It is a minute elongated projection placed below

ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 481 the abdominal aorta about a quarter of an inch below the cceliac axis. At its origin it is covered by the pancreas, and crossed by the splenic vein. Emerging from under cover of the pancreas, it crosses the third part of the duodenum, close to the duodeno-jejunal flexure, and then enters the mesentery proper. Between the two layers of the mesentery it takes a slightly curved course towards the right iliac fossa, where it ends by anastomosing with one of its own branches. The convexity of the curve which it describes is directed to the left, and the concavity to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein, which lies upon its right side, and by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves which surrounds it closely. The following branches proceed from the superior mesen- teric artery:— 1. Inferior pancreaticoduodenal. The inferior pancreatico-duode?ial takes origin from the superior mesenteric under cover of the pancreas. It has a curved course round the head of this gland, between it and the duodenum, and gives branches to both. It ends by anastomosing with the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery. The rami iniestini tenuis (arterias intestinales) spring from the convexity or left side of the superior mesenteric, and pro- ceed obliquely downwards and to the left, between the layers of the mesentery, to supply the jejunum and ileum. They are very numerous, from twelve to fifteen, or even more, in number, and, by their mutual inosculations, they form a very remarkable series of arches before they finally reach the bowel. At first they run parallel to one another, but soon they divide into two branches, each of which joins its neighbour, and in this way a succession of arterial arcades vol. 1.—31 2.

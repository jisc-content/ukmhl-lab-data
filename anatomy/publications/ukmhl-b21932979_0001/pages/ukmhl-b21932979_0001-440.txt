Close to the crest of the ilium the fascia transversalis is pierced first by the ascending branch and then by the terminal branches of the deep circumflex iliac artery. In front, in the inguinal region, its connections are more com- plicated, and must be studied at three different points—(i) between the anterior superior iliac spine and the femoral Fig. S5.—Diagram to illustrate the relation of the lower portions of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles to the inguinal canal.

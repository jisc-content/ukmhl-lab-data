Laterally, it is strong and dense, and in this situation it covers the inner surface of the obturator interims muscle.

In front of this, the line of attachment of the parietal pelvic fascia leaves the ilio-pectineal line; it descends obliquely along the superior border of the obturator internus muscle to the upper margin of the thyroid foramen, and, opposite the groove on the under surface of the ascend- ing ramus of the pubic bone, there is a break in its bony attachment.

There is thus a considerable part of the inner surface of the pelvis below the level of the ilio-pectineal line, and the crest of the pubis devoid of fascial lining.

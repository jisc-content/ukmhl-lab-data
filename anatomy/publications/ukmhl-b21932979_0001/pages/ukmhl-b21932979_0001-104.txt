THE UPPER LIMB. So In the upper arm the musculocutaneous supplies branches to the three muscles in this region. The branch to the coraco-brachialis is given off before the parent trunk enters the substance of the muscle ; the branches to the biceps and brachialis anticus issue from it, as it lies between them. The Coraco-brachialis is an elongated muscle, which takes origin from the tip of the coracoid process in con- junction with the short head of the biceps. It proceeds downwards along the inner margin of the biceps, and obtains insertion into a linear ridge situated upon the inner aspect of the shaft of the humerus about its middle. The Biceps Flexor Cubiti arises from the scapula by two distinct heads of origin. The short or inner head (caput breve) springs from the tip of the coracoid process in con- junction with the coraco-brachialis. The long or outer head (caput longum) is a rounded tendon, which occupies the bicipital groove of the humerus. Its origin cannot be studied at this stage of the dissection, because it is placed within the capsule of the shoulder-joint. Suffice it for the present to say, that it arises from an impression on the scapula immediately above the glenoid fossa. Both heads swell out into elongated fleshy bellies, which are closely applied to each other, and afterwards unite in the lower third of the arm. Towards the bend of the elbow the fleshy fibres converge upon a stout, short tendon, which is inserted into the posterior part of the tuberosity of the radius. This insertion will be more fully examined at a later period, but it may be noticed in the meantime that the tendon is twisted so as to present its margins to the front and back of the limb, and further, that a synovial bursa is interposed between it and the anterior smooth part of the radial tuberosity. The dissector has already taken notice of the bicipital or semilunar fascia, and has separated it artificially from the brachial aponeurosis above, and from the deep fascia of

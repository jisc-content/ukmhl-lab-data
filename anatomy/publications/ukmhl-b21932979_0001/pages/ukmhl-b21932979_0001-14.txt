viii PREFACE. room led the author to believe that it would be an advan- tage to introduce into this text-book his methods of dissecting the temporal bone. Most of the illustrations are new, but many have also been borrowed from the writings of well-known authors. In every case the source from which the latter have been obtained is acknowledged in the text. The author has specially to thank Dr. Symington and Professor Paterson for the generous manner in which they have supplied him with original drawings and wood-blocks. It is also the pleasing duty of the author to gratefully acknowledge the assistance he has received from different members of his staff of demonstrators in the preparation of this book. More especially is he indebted to Dr. T. E. Gordon for the preparation of dissections; to Dr. R. H. Woods for suggestions regarding the chapters on the larynx and pharynx; and above all, to Mr. G. J. Johnstone for assistance in the correction of the proofs. Trinity College, Dublin, 2nd October 1893.

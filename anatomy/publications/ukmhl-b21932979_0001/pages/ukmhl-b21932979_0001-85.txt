61 SHOULDER—SCAPULAR REGION. scapulae, and the ventral branches of the posterior scapular, join to form a network. The importance of this free communication between the blood vessels in relation to the scapula will be manifest when it is remembered that two of the main arteries, viz., the posterior scapular and the supra- scapular, spring indirectly from the first part of the subclavian ; whilst the third, viz., the subscapular, arises from the third part of the axillary. When, therefore, a ligature is applied to any part of the great arterial trunk of the upper limb, between the first stage of the subclavian and the third part of the axillary, this anastomosis affords ample means of re-establishing the circulation. Dissection.—Detach the subscapulars from the scapula and lift it out- wards to its insertion. This will afford a better view of its relation to the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and also of the subscapular bursa. In a well-injected subject the ventral anastomosis can likewise be made out. Suprascapular and Spino-glenoid Ligaments.—These are two ligamentous bands, which are placed in relation to the suprascapular artery and nerve. The suprascapular or trans- verse ligament bridges across the suprascapular notch of the scapula, and converts it into a foramen. It lies between the artery and nerve: the former being placed above it, and the latter below it. Not infrequently it is ossified. The spino-glenoid ligament is a weaker band, which bridges across the suprascapular artery and nerve as they pass through the great scapular notch. On the one hand it is attached to the spine of the scapula, and on the other to the upper part of the neck of the scapula.

The radial is a purely cutaneous nerve, and gives off no branches until it gains the dorsal aspect of the lower end of the forearm. Muscles.—The muscles on the front and inner border of the forearm are arranged in a superficial and a deep group. They comprise the flexors of the wrist and fingers, and also the pronators. In the superficial group we find the pronator flex, carpi radialis. xt. minimi digiti. anconeus. Fig. 25.—Transverse section through the upper third of the left forearm. P. L. Palmaris longus. E.C.D.

The fleshy belly of the flexor sublimis only partially comes to the surface ; the chief bulk of it is placed upon a deeper plane than the others. The deep group is composed of three muscles, placed in contact with the bones and interosseous membrane of the

PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 35 and this so abruptly that a crescentic margin is formed, which, on account of its being thicker and stronger than the rest of the membrane, is sometimes called the costo- coracoid, or bicornuate ligament. The lower connections of the membrane are somewhat indefinite, and difficult to establish with precision. In a good subject, however, it will be seen to join the sheath of the axillary vessels, and also to give a process of fascia to the sheath of the pectoralis minor. Four structures pierce the costo-coracoid membrane, and these should now be cleaned. They are :—(1) the thoracic as. Fig. 10.—Diagram of the costo-coracoid membrane. C. Clavicle. SUBS.

Dissection.—The costo-coracoid membrane should be removed, and the axillary space entered from above. With a little dissection the con- tents of the upper part of the space may be exposed. These are the axillary artery, with the axillary vein on its inner side, and partly over- lapping it. To the outer side, and to some extent above the vessels, are placed the great brachial nerves. All these important structures are enveloped in a loose, funnel-shaped sheath, which is prolonged into the axilla from the deep ce vical fascia. Crossing behind the artery, and

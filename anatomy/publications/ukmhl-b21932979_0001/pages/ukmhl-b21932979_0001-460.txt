436 ABDOMEN. Oblique inguinal hernia follows the course of the spermatic cord. The protrusion traverses the entire length of the inguinal canal, entering at the inlet or internal abdominal ring, and emerging (when the hernia is com- plete) at the outlet or external abdominal ring. Direct inguinal hernia only traverses the lower part of the inguinal canal. It pushes before it or bursts through that part of the posterior wall of the canal which forms the floor of Hesselbach's triangle, and, having thus gained the interior of the canal by a short cut, it emerges like the oblique variety at the external abdominal ring. The deep epigastric artery bears a different relation to each of these Fig. 89.â€”Diagram to show the relation of parts after an ordinary inguinal hernia has reached the bottom of the scrotum.

This vessel lies close to the inner margin of the internal abdominal ring, and it forms the outer boundary of Hesselbach's triangle; consequently, in oblique inguinal hernia, the protrusion, as it enters the inguinal canal, lies external to the vessel, whilst, in direct inguinal hernia, it lies internal to it. So important are these relations, that the terms external and internal are frequently employed to denote the two forms of inguinal hernia instead of oblique and direct.

THE UPPER LIMB. 110 As the median nerve enters the forearm it gives off numerous branches for the supply of muscles, and near the wrist it supplies the median palmar cutaneous nerve, which has already been dissected. The muscular branches supply the pronator radii teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor sublimis digitorum—all the muscles of the superficial group therefore, with the single exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It likewise supplies a long slender twig—the anterior interosseous—which goes to the deep muscles on the front of the forearm. Deep Structures on the front of the Forearm.—The connections of the deep muscles must now be studied, and at the same time the anterior interosseous artery and nerve must be followed. The flexor profundus is the large muscle which clothes the anterior and inner aspects of the ulna; the flexor longus pollicis is placed upon the anterior surface of the radius ; while the pronator quadratus is a quadrate fleshy layer closely applied to both bones immediately above the wrist. The artery and nerve proceed downwards in the interval between the flexor profundus and flexor longus pollicis. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum springs from the anterior and internal surfaces of the ulna in its upper three fourths. It likewise derives fibres from the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane and the aponeurosis, by which the flexor carpi ulnaris takes origin from the posterior border of the ulna. The fleshy mass gives place to four tendons for the four inner digits, but only one of these—that for the forefinger—becomes separate and distinct in the forearm. They proceed downwards behind the anterior annular liga- ment into the palm. The Flexor Longus Pollicis arises from the anterior surface of the radius, from the oblique line above to the upper border of the pronator quadratus below. It also

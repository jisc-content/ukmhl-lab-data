The vesical layer will be seen to pass backwards on each side of the symphysis, in the form of a strong, rounded, and cord-like band, which proceeds over the anterior surface of the prostate to the bladder. These cord-like bands are the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, or, if they are looked at merely in their relations to the pubis and the prostate, they are called the pubo-prostatic ligaments. In the layer. Fig. 131.â€”This diagram represents the pelvic fascia in section a short distance to the outer side of the mesial plane, beyond the point at which the parietal and visceral layers blend ; hence both are seen in section. middle line there is a very evident interval or recess between them, so deep in some cases that the tip of the little finger can be introduced into it. The dorsal vein of the penis passes backwards in this groove. The fascia is not deficient at the bottom of this furrow. It is prolonged from one side to the other over the dorsal vein, so as to hide it from view. In the accompanying diagram (Fig. 131), which represents a

ABDOMEN. 566 tjiis^Jo_^hak^igaiG£j^^ Traced forwards, it will be found to be fixed to the rami of the pubis and ischium (i.e., the side of the pubic arch) in front of the obturator internus. In this manner, therefore, it may be said to have an attach- ment to the pelvic outlet from the symphysis to the sacrum. When followed backwards, the fascia will be noticed to pass over and close the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and then to turn inwards at an angle to reach the parts on the front of the anterior aspect of the sacrum, or, in other words, to form the fascia of the pyriformis muscle. From the close relation which this lateral piece of the parietal pelvic fascia presents to the obturator internus muscle—covering it and having its extent very nearly de- termined by the area occupied by the muscle—it is very commonly called the obturator fascia. We have previously seen that the parietal pelvic fascia gives off from its inner surface a layer called the visceral layer, which proceeds inwards towards the viscera, and acts as a partition between the pelvis and the perineum.

It can always be seen by an examination of the outer surface of the pelvic fascia (Figs. 126 and 127).

But the "white line" has a still wider significance. It also indicates the fascial origin of the levator ani muscle. It must be ad- mitted, however, that in many cases the fibres of this muscle pass upwards beyond the " white line," and separate the visceral and parietal layers of the pelvic fascia from each other for a variable distance.

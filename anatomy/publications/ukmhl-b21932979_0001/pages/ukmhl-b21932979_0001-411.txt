THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 387 bulb, a branch of the internal pudic, which in this case is given to the bulb of the vagina, and the two terminal branches of the internal pudic artery, viz., the dorsal arlery of the clitoris, and the artery to the corpus caver?iosum. The internal pudic nerve ends by dividing into the per- ineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The. perineal nerve gives off—(1) the anterior and posterior superficial perineal branches to the skin covering the labium majus ; (2) muscular twigs to all the perineal muscles ; and (3) a branch to the bulb of the vagina. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris gives a twig to the corpus cavernosum, and runs forwards with the artery of the same name between the crura to reach the dorsum of the clitoris. Dorsal Vessels and Nerves of the Clitoris.—On the dorsum of the clitoris a little dissection will display the dorsal vein occupying the groove in the middle line, with a dorsal artery and nerve lying upon each side of it. The arteries and nerves should be traced forwards to their distribution in the glans. The dorsal vein takes origin in the glans. As it proceeds backwards it receives certain superficial veins and also tributaries from the corpora cavernosa. At the root of the clitoris it dips downwards between the crura, and, passing between the triangular and the subpubic ligaments, is con- tinued backwards into the pelvis to join the plexus of veins around the neck of the bladder.

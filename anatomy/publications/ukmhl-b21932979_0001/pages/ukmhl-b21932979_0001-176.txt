152 THE UPPER LIMB. covering it completely, except on its inner side. It arises from the deep depression below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and also from the external lateral ligament of the elbow and the orbicular ligament of the radius. From this origin the fibres sweep round the posterior, outer and anterior surfaces of the radius, and clothe its shaft as far down as the insertion of the pronator radii teres. The posterior interosseous nerve traverses the substance of the muscle, and separates it into two layers. ARTICULATIONS. Elbow-joint.—At the elbow-joint the trochlear surface of the humerus is grasped by the greater sigmoid cavity of biceps .. brachialis anticus median basilic vein brachial artery flexor carpi ulnaris. Fig. 34.—Vertical section through humerus and ulna at the elbow-joint. the ulna. The shallow depression on the upper surface of the head of the radius rests upon the capitellum of the humerus, and its slightly raised rim occupies the groove on the lower end of the humerus between the capitellum and the trochlea. The ligaments of the elbow-joint are arranged in the form of a capsule which surrounds the articulation on all sides. From the differences which this exhibits in

569 PEL VIS. that the anterior fibres of the levator ani arise. The visceral pelvic fascia now passes inwards upon the pelvic surface of the levator ani muscle to the side of the prostate and the base of the bladder, and divides into three layers, termed— —(1.) the vesical; (2.) the recto-vesical; and (3.) the rectal. These have different connections, according to the point at which they are examined. In the region of the bladder (Fig. 129), the splitting of the visceral pelvic fascia takes place at the outer margin of the vesicula seminalis, and the vesical, or highest layer, turns upwards upon the lower part of the side of the bladder, and Fig. 129. constitutes its "lateral true ligament." Upon the wall of this viscus the vesical prolongation gradually thins away until it is ultimately lost upon its coats. The recto-vesical, or intermediate layer, is carried inwards between the bladder and the rectum, and, in the mesial plane, it becomes con- tinuous with the corresponding layer of the opposite side. As it proceeds inwards it splits to enclose and form a capsule for the vesicula seminalis and the vas deferens. The rectal, or loivest layer, is prolonged downwards upon the side of the rectum—between it and the levator ani muscle— and then, turning backwards behind the gut, it becomes

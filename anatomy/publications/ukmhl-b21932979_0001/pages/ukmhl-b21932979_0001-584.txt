ABDOMEN. 552 external iliac artery, reaches the internal abdominal ring. Here it joins the other constituents of the spermatic cord, and, leaving the abdomen, is distributed to the cremaster muscle. In the female the genital branch is very small, and ends in the round ligament of the uterus and the labium pudendi. The crural branch runs downwards along the outer side of the external iliac artery, and, crossing the deep circumflex iliac artery, passes behind Poupart's ligament. It supplies a limited portion of the integument in front of the thigh. The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh emerges from the outer border of the psoas about its middle, and descends obliquely across the iliacus muscle to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. At this point it leaves the abdomen by passing behind Poupart's ligament. It supplies the skin upon the outer aspect of the thigh. The anterior crural nerve is the largest branch of the plexus. It runs downwards in the interval between the psoas and iliacus, and passes from the abdomen behind Poupart's ligament. It will be observed to give twigs to the iliacus muscle, and a branch to the upper part of the femoral artery. The obturator nerve emerges from the inner border of the psoas, where this muscle reaches the brim of the pelvis, and extends forwards upon the inner wall of the pelvis a short way below the ilio-pectineal line of the innominate bone. At the upper part of the thyroid foramen it joins the artery of the same name, and, escaping from the pelvis, enters the thigh.1 1 A small nerve, the accessory obttirator, is occasionally to be found. It may either spring directly from the obturator or from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It proceeds downwards along the inner side of the psoas, and it enters the thigh by passing over the pubic bone under cover of the pectineus. Here it gives branches to the hip joint, and unites with the obturator nerve. It also occasionally supplies a twig to the pectineus muscle.

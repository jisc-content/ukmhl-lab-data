The posterior wall of the tube is formed by the flat palmar surfaces of the phalanges ; the front wall is composed of the fibrous sheath which bridges over the tendons, and is attached on each side to the sharp lateral margins of the phalanges. The strength of this sheath differs very much at different points. Opposite the centre of each of the two proximal phalanges it is com-

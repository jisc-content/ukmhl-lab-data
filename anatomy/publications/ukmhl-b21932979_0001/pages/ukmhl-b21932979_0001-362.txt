33§ THE LOWER LIMB. of the cuboid behind its ridge. This ligament is broader than the long plantar ligament, and is apparent along its inner border even before the latter is reflected. The dorsal and internal ligaments connect the os calcis and cuboid bones upon the superior and inner aspects of the joint. The internal ligament, sometimes called inter- osseous, is to be sought for in the deep pit between the head of the astragalus and the fore part of the os calcis. The joint between the astragalus and scaphoid bone, and that between the os calcis and the cuboid bone, are sometimes referred to as the " transverse tarsal joint." It is here that the movements of eversion and inversion of the foot chiefly take place, and it should be noted that all the ligaments which connect these two segments of the tarsus together, with the exception of one, are attached posteriorly to the os calcis. They are— Inferior calcaneo-scaphoid, External calcaneo-scaphoid, Long plantar, Short plantar, Dorsal calcaneo-cuboid, Internal calcaneo-cuboid, Dorsal astragalo-scaphoid, Inter-cuneiform Articulations.—The three cuneiform bones are held together so firmly that very little individual movement is permitted. The chief uniting structures are two strong interosseotts ligaments which pass between the non-articular portions of their opposed surfaces. These can only be seen when the bones are separated from each other. Dorsal inter-cuneiform ligaments are also present. These are short flat transversely-placed bands. Scapho-cuneiform Articulation.—The three cuneiform bones articulate with the anterior surface of the scaphoid. They are held in position by dorsal ligaments, which pass from the dorsal surface of the scaphoid to the dorsal surface of each of the cuneiform bones, and by J>lantar ligaments, which are similarly disposed.

ABDOMEN. 560 dividing into' two lateral parts which are continued down- wards on the back wall of the pelvis, and along the inner side of the internal iliac vessels to the pelvic plexuses. Pelvic Fascia.—Now is the time to study the pelvic fascia, and it is a work which will require some care and patience on the part of the dissector. Much of the difficulty which is involved in the study of the pelvic fascia will be re- moved if the student will constantly keep before him two facts regarding it, viz., (1) That it constitutes a continuous lining for the inner surface of the pelvic wall. (2) That.it.sends g££2g^he_pdvic -Cajity -3 Jayer_ which acts as a partition betvy^gjij^jidyia^r^ The lining- portion of the fascia may be termed the parietal fiart* and the partition-portion the visceral part. If the pelvis con- tained no viscera, the arrangement would be exceedingly simple, and might be represented diagrammatically thus :— Fig. 124. The visceral layer, however, comes into relation with the viscera, and the connections which it forms with these give rise to the complexity of the membrane. In order to obtain a proper display of the pelvic fascia, it is necessary to dissect it from three different aspects, viz. (1) From above; (2) From below; (3) From the side. The arrows in the diagram indicate the directions in which

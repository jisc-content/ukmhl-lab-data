THE UPPER LIMB. 58 The Teres Minor is the small muscle which lies along the lower border of the infraspinatus. It arises from an elongated flat impression on the dorsal aspect of the axillary border of the scapula, and from the septa of the fascia infra- spinata which intervene between it, the infraspinatus and teres major muscles. It is inserted into the lowest of the three impressions on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and also, by fleshy fibres, into the shaft of the bone for about half an inch below this. Towards its insertion it is separated from the teres major by the long head of the triceps. The Infraspinatus arises from the whole of the infra- spinous fossa, with the exception of a small part of it near the neck of the scapula. It also derives fibres from the fascia which covers it. Its tendon of insertion is closely adherent to the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and is attached to the middle impression on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The Subscapularis arises from the whole of the subsca- pular fossa, with the exception of a small portion near the neck of the scapula ; it also takes origin from the groove which is present on the ventral aspect of the axillary border of the bone. Its origin is strengthened by tendinous inter- sections, which are attached to the ridges which are present on the venter scapulae. The fleshy fibres thus derived con- verge upon a stout tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus; a few of the lower fibres, how- ever, gain independent insertion into the shaft of the humerus below the tuberosity. As the muscle proceeds outwards to its insertion, it passes under an arch formed by the coracoid process and the con- joined origin of the short head of the biceps and coraco- brachialis. By dissecting between the upper border of the muscle and the root of the coracoid process, a bursa of some size will be discovered. This bursa communicates with the cavity of the shoulder-joint through an aperture in

558 ABDOMEN. downwards upon the sacrum and coccyx, to the concavity of which a portion of it is adapted. The bladder is placed in the fore-part of the cavity, and lies against the pubic bones. Behind the bladder, between it and the rectum, are the vesicidce seminales and the vasa deferentia, whilst embracing its neck is the prostate. At present, however, the bladder and the rectum are the only viscera visible. Peritoneum.—The peritoneum is continued from the posterior wall of the abdomen into the pelvis. Here it comes into relation with the rectum, to which it gives a partial covering. The first part of the rectum it invests completely, and connects by means of a fold called the meso-rectum to the anterior surface of the sacrum. Gradu- ally it leaves the gut, first disappearing from its posterior surface, then from its lateral, and finally from its anterior surface, and passes on to the lower and back part of the bladder. The point at which the peritoneum departs from the rectum may be stated to be about three inches above the anus, or, in other words, along a line connecting the middle points of the two vesiculse seminales—somewhat less than an inch from the base of the prostate. This is a point, however, which is subject to variation. It is not uncommon to find the peritoneum passing lower down ; and, in rare instances, it may even be seen to reach the base of the prostate before it is continued on to the bladder. The peritoneum now ascends upon the back of the bladder, and, reaching the apex, is conducted from it by the urachus on to the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall. On each side of the viscus it extends outwards as far as the obliterated hypogastric artery, along the line of which it quits the bladder, and is continued round the pelvic wall. Rectovesical Pouch.—As the peritoneum passes from the posterior wall of the pelvis to the back of the bladder, it is raised- in the form of two semilunar and horizontal

THE UPPER LIMB. the interosseous membrane it divides into two terminal branches, viz., the anterior and the posterior interosseous arteries. The ulnar carpal branches are two small arteries, which partially encircle the wrist. The anterior ulnar carpal runs inwards, under cover of the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum, and anastomoses with the anterior radial carpal artery. From the arch thus formed small twigs are given to the front aspect of the carpal bones and joints. The posterior ulnar carpal artery gains the dorsal aspect of the carpus by winding round the ulnar margin of the limb immediately above the pisiform bone, and under cover of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulnar Nerve.—The ulnar nerve, which was traced in the dissection of the arm as far as the interval between the olecranon and internal condyle of the humerus, enters the forearm between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It proceeds downwards upon the flexor profundus digitorum, and under cover of the flexor carpi ulnaris along the front of the ulnar side of the forearm. Close to the wrist it becomes superficial upon the outer side of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and it reaches the palm by passing in front of the anterior annular ligament. In the upper third of the forearm the ulnar nerve is separated from the ulnar artery by an interval, but below this it is closely applied to the inner side of the vessel. In the forearm the ulnar nerve gives off:— 1. Articular branches to the elbow joint. , . ("to the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner 2.

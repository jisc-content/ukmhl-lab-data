53° ABDOMEN. Ur B. nected with the kidney. As it approaches the hilum it expands into a wide funnel-shaped portion called the pelvis. This enters the sinus and divides into two, or perhaps three, large primary branches, and these again break up into a large number of short stunted secondary divisions called calices or infundibula, which are at- tached to the walls of the sinus. // Fig. 118.—Two different forms of the pelvis of the ureter.

The kidney should now be cut into two in the longitudinal direction. Use a large knife, and, entering it at the external border, carry it steadily through the gland substance to the hilum. R.P. An examination of the cut surface of the kidney will show that its substance is arranged in two parts—a medullary and a cortical. The medullary portion is seen to consist of dark-coloured, faintly-striated pyramidal masses, the bases of which are directed towards the periphery, whilst their apices are free and project into the sinus. On the sinus wall each of these appears in the form of a prominent mammillary projection, called a renal papilla, which projects into one of the calices of the pelvis of the ureter. . If the kidney be squeezed, fluid will be seen to exude from these papillse, showing that the tubuli uriniferi open upon their sur- FlG. 119.—Two renal papilla1. I P. Renal papilla. C.

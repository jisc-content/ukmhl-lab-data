62 THE UPPER LIMB. FRONT OF THE ARM. In this dissection the following parts have to be studied :— 1. Cutaneous vessels and nerves. 2. Brachial aponeurosis. 3. Brachial artery and its branches. 4. Median, ulnar, musculo-spiral, and musculo-cutaneous nerves and the branches of the last two. 5. Biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis anticus muscles. In conjunction with this dissection, it is convenient to study the triangular space in front of the elbow, and also to trace the cutaneous nerves to their ultimate distribution in the skin of the forearm. Surface Anatomy.—In a muscular limb the prominence formed by the biceps muscle along the front of the upper arm is very apparent. Everyone is familiar with the rounded swelling which it produces when powerfully contracted in the living subject. On either side of the biceps there is a feebly-marked furrow, and ascending in each of these there is a large superficial vein. In the outer furrow is the cephalic vein; in the inner furrow the basilic vein. The humerus is thickly clothed by muscles; but towards its lower part the two supracondyloid ridges, leading down to the condylar eminences, may be felt. The external ridge is the more salient of the two, and therefore the more evident to touch. But by far the most important objects for us to distin- guish are the bony points around the elbow. It is by a proper knowledge of the normal relative positions of these that the surgeon is able to distinguish between the different forms of fracture and dislocation which so frequently occur in this region. First note the internal condyle of the humerus. This constitutes a prominence, appreciable to the eye; grasp it between the finger and thumb, and note

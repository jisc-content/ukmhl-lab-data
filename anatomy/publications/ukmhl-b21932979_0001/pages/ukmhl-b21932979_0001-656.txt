Broad Ligament of the Uterus.—This is a wide fold com- posed of two layers of peritoneum which stretches from each lateral border of the uterus to the opposite part of the pelvic wall and iliac fossa. The superior border of the liga- ment is occupied by the Fallopian tube, the fimbriated free outer extremity of which opens into the peritoneal cavity. OST.ABDOM. FIMBR.OVARICA OS UTERI EXTERNUM Fig. 145.—The uterus, with the broad ligament stretch- ing out from either side of it (from Gegenbaur). The line which leads from LIGAM. OVARIO-PELV. on the left side points to the round ligament of the uterus. The peritoneal fold immediately beyond this is the ligamentum ovario- pelvicum. Here, therefore, a continuity is established between the mucous lining of the tube and the peritoneal membrane. At a lower level than the Fallopian tube two secondary folds will be observed in connection with the broad ligament. Of these one projects backwards, and contains between its layers the ovary and its ligament, whilst the other is directed forwards, and contains the round ligament of the uterus. In addition to these more conspicuous objects, the two

6 THE UPPER LIMB. from the middle line of the back. They reach the surface by piercing the latissimus dorsi muscle on a line with the angles of the ribs and outer margin of the erector spinse muscle. In every case the cutaneous branches derived from the dorsal nerves turn outwards in the superficial fascia, and may be traced for a varying distance in this direction. It is important to note that the area of skin supplied by these cutaneous nerves is in each case placed at a lower level than the origin of the posterior primary division from which they arise. In the lumbar region three cutaneous nerves reach the surface by piercing the lumbar aponeurosis at the outer margin of the erector spinse, a short distance above the ilium. They are the terminal twigs of the external branches of the posterior primary divisions of the three upper lumbar spinal nerves; and they differ from those above, inasmuch as they turn downwards over the crest of the ilium to supply the skin of the gluteal region. The cutaneous arteries which accompany these nerves come from the dorsal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries. Muscles connecting the limb to the dorsal aspect of the trunk.—These are five in number, and are arranged in two strata. Two form the superficial stratum, viz., the trape- zius and the latissimus dorsi. Both are broad, flat muscles which cover the greater part of the dorsal aspect of the trunk, from the occiput above to the ilium below. The trapezius lies over the back of the neck and the chest. The latissimus dorsi is placed lower down. The deeper stratum of muscles, composed of the levator anguli scapula? and the two rhomboid muscles, is placed under cover of the trapezius. Dissection.—The trapezius muscle should now be cleaned. This muscle belongs only in part to the dissector of the upper limb. The portion of it which lies above the prominent spine of the seventh

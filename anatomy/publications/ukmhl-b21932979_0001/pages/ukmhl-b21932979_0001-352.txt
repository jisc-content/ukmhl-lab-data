THE LOWER LIMB. 328 semilunar cartilage on the inner side of the extreme anterior part of the area. (2) The anterior crucial ligament and the anterior horn of the external semilunar cartilage: these are placed side by side, but the attachment of the former, which lies to the inner side, overlaps that of the external semilunar cartilage. (3) The posterior horn of the external semilunar cartilage on the summit of the tibial spine be- tween its two tubercles. (4) The posterior horn of the internal semilunar cartilage immediately behind the tibial spine. (5) The posterior crucial ligament at the hinder part of the area. THE ANKLE-JOINT. The ankle-joint is a diarthrodial articulation of the gingly- mus or hinge variety. The articulation takes place be- tween the bones of the leg and the astragalus, and the weight of the body is transferred through it to the foot. It is a joint of great strength; its stability being ensured not only by the powerful ligaments which surround it, but also by the close interlocking of the articulating surfaces. The bones which enter into the formation of the ankle- joint are the lower ends of the tibia and fibula and the superior surface of the astragalus. The lower ends of the leg bones are very firmly united together by an interos- seous and other ligaments which give the joint a certain amount of elasticity or spring. They form a deep hollow resembling a mortice. The upper surface of the astragalus is received into this cavity. The ligaments of the ankle-joint are : 1. The anterior. 2. The posterior. 3. The external lateral. 4. The internal lateral. Dissection.â€”The remains of the annular ligaments, together with the tendons which are in relation to the joint, should be removed and the ligaments defined. The anterior and posterior ligaments should be first dissected. They may then be removed in order to bring the powerful

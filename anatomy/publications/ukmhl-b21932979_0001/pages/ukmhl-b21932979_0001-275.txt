INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. 2Si nerve. It is very rare to find a twig given to the pectineus either by it or by the trunk of the obturator nerve itself. The Internal Circumflex Artery arises from the inner and back aspect of the profunda femoris at the same level as the origin of the external circumflex. It proceeds back- wards between the psoas and pectineus, and then between the upper border of the adductor brevis and the obturator externus to gain the back of the limb. Close to the small trochanter of the femur it divides into two termi- nal branches—a transverse and an ascending. From the main trunk before it divides are given off several mus- cular branches to the adjoining muscles, and an articular branch, which enters the hip-joint through the cotyloid notch. The terminal branches of the internal circumflex have already been examined in the dissection of the gluteal region (p. 186). Branches of the Femoral Artery.—In every region of the thigh the dissector has met with branches of the femoral artery. It is well now that he should revert to this vessel and study its branches systema- tically. The following Table may aid him in doing this :— Femoral. Superficial pudic. Superficial epigastric. Superficial circumflex iliac. Deep external pudic. Superficial inguinal. Profunda, or deep femoral. Muscular. ^ Anastomotica magna. External circumflex. Internal circumflex. First perforating. Second perforating. -| Nutrient. Third perforating. Fourth perforating, or terminal. The Adductor Brevis lies behind the adductor longus and the pectineus. It arises below the origin of the ad- ductor longus from the anterior aspect of the body and the descending ramus of the pubis. As it descends it

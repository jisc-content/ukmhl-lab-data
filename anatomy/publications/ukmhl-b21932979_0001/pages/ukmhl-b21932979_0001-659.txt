PEL VIS. 627 Pelvic Viscera. Eectum.—A detailed account of the rectum, as it is found in the male, is given at p. 574. It is only necessary, there- fore, to mention here the points of difference in the female. The relations and extent of the first part are similar in every respect, with one exception—viz., that the peritoneal ail-de-sac in front separates it, not from the bladder, but from the uterus. The second part is also separated, for a short distance, by the recto-vaginal cul-de-sac of peritoneum from the uterus and vagina. Below this, however, it is in apposition with the posterior wall of the vagina—a layer of pelvic fascia (the Fig. 146.—Two forms of the empty female bladder as seen in mesial section. (After Disse.) recto-vaginal) alone intervening. The connection between the rectal and vaginal walls is at first very loose, but after- wards much more intimate. This has an important bearing upon the manner in which prolapsus uteri takes place. It should be noted that whilst the greater part of this portion of the rectum is supported by the sacrum and coccyx, there is fully an inch of its lower portion which rests upon the ano-coccygeal body (Fig. 147). The third part or anal canal bends downwards and back- wards about one inch in front of the coccyx, so that an angular interval is left between the gut and the vagina—an interval to which the term perineum is restricted by the

GLUTEAL REGION. i83 sciatic artery, the two terminal branches of the internal circumflex, and the first perforating artery may be made out. The Small Sciatic Nerve arises from the sacral plexus within the pelvis. After escaping through the great sacro- sciatic foramen it extends downwards with the sciatic artery under cover of the gluteus maximus. Reaching the lower border of this muscle it proceeds vertically downwards on the back of the thigh, immediately subjacent to the deep fascia. It will afterwards be traced to the posterior aspect of the calf. In the gluteal region it gives off several cutaneous branches, viz.—(1) twigs which wind round the lower border of the gluteus maximus to supply a limited area of the skin of the buttock; (2) a few twigs to the skin on the inner side of the thigh ; and (3) the long pudendal nerve of Scemmerring. The long pudendal nerve turns inwards round the origin of the hamstring muscles to reach the perineum. The Great Sciatic—the largest nerve in the body—comes from the sacral plexus, and enters the gluteal region through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. At first it has the form of a flattened band, but soon it becomes oval or round, as seen in section. Covered by the gluteus maximus, the great sciatic nerve traverses the gluteal region in the interval between the great trochanter of the femur and the tuber ischii. From above downwards it lies on the innominate bone (at the lower margin of the great sciatic notch), the tendon of the obturator internus with its two gemelli muscles, the quadratus femoris, and the adductor magnus. In this region it does not, as a rule, give off any branch, but occasionally the nerves to one or more of the hamstring muscles issue from the main trunk as high as the level of the quadratus femoris. The great sciatic nerve frequently escapes from the pelvis in the form of two trunks, which enclose between them a portion of the piriformis muscle.

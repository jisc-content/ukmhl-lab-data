It may be noted that the outer edge of the erector spinse usually corre- sponds with the bare posterior surface of the colon at this level (Fig. 97). The sigmoid flexure extends from the crest of the ilium to the brim of the true pelvis, where it becomes continuous with the rectum at a point corresponding to the left sacro- iliac articulation. It forms a long single loop of intestine, which is bound to the left iliac fossa by an extensive fold of Fig. 97.â€”From a tracing of a transverse section through the abdomen, at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. p.\ and /.2 indicate the points at which the peritoneum is reflected from the descending colon on to the posterior wall of the abdomen.

The sigmoid flexure may, therefore, be defined as being that part of the great gut which is attached to the wall of the false pelvis; whilst the rectum is that part of the bowel which is fixed to the posterior wall of the true pelvis. The subdivision is somewhat arbitrary, seeing that the sigmoid meso-colon runs

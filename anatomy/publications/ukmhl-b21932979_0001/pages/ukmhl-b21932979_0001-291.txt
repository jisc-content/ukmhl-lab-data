267 THE LEG. foot, communicates with the external saphenous nerve, and then divides into two branches, which supply the contiguous margins of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. Therefore, with the exception of the adjacent sides of the great toe and the second toe, which are supplied by the anterior tibial nerve, and the outer side of the little toe, which is supplied by the external saphenous nerve, the musculo-cutaneous nerve furnishes twigs to the two margins of each of the toes.1 The anterior tibial nerve, or rather its internal terminal branch, pierces the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot in the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones. It receives a communicating branch from the inner part of the musculo-cutaneous, and ends by divid- ing into two twigs, which go to supply the adjacent margins of the great toe and the second toe. Deep Fascia.—The fatty superficial fascia should be removed in order that the deep fascia may be displayed. This aponeurosis does not form a complete investment for the leg. l£^js_ikbjsejr£_j3yj^ s_mfac^^£^th^jibja, aryi^js^jy^a^hjj^^ !J2JSI!£Jw]2fir4e^^ Ij^jsjdjj0^ab§e^^ triajigjfiaj^jsubc^ fibula, ljsing__jitt^!^ mJnDnJ>_JajTC^^ It is not equally dense throughout.

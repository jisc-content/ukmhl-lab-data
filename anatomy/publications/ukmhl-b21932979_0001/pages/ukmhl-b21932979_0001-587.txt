PEL VIS. ■ 555 called the ascending lumbar vein. By its upper end this venous trunk is connected with the corresponding azygos vein. Dissection.—The lower limbs having, by this time, been removed from the trunk, the pelvis may also be detached. Place a ligature around the aorta and vena cava at the level of the bifurcation of the former, and divide them immediately above this point. Then carry the knife through the intervertebral disc which intervenes between the third and fourth lumbar vertebra;, and, having cut the nerves and soft parts, complete the separation of the pelvis from the remainder of the trunk by means of the saw. PELVIS. The pelvis is the basin-shaped lower part of the abdominal cavity. It has already been defined as being that portion of the general cavity of the abdomen which lies below and behind the ilio-pectineal lines of the innominate bones. Its walls are, for the most part, rigid and composed of bone; behifid, it is bounded by the sacrum and coccyx ; whilst, in front and laterally, it is bounded by the two ossa innominata. The bony wall, however, is deficient at certain points ; thus, posteriorly, there is an interval on each side, between the sacrum and the os innominatum, which is partially filled up by the sacro-sciatic ligaments; again, laterally, there is the wide thyroid foramen, which is closed by the thyroid membrane ; and, in front, there is the gap left by the pubic arch, which is occupied by the triangular ligament of the urethra.1 Upon the inner aspect of these boundaries of the pelvis there are placed certain muscles. Posteriorly, upon the anterior aspect of the sacrum, are the two pyriformes muscles; laterally, upon the inner aspect of each innomi- 1 Let it be clearly understood that it is the inferior or superficial layer of the triangular ligament to which we refer, and not the "deep layer."

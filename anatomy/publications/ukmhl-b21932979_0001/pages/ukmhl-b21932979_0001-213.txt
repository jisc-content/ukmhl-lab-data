GLUTEAL REGION. follows accurately the middle curved line on the dorsum ilii, and at the anterior superior spine terminates by anastomosing with the superficial and deep circumflex iliac arteries, and with the ascending branch of the external circumflex. The latter has already been noticed passing upwards under cover of the tensor fasciae femoris. The inferior branch runs downwards and forwards towards the great trochanter. It gives twigs to the two gluteal muscles between which it lies, and some terminal offsets to the hip-joint. The Superior Gluteal Nerve emerges from the pelvis in company with the gluteal artery, and passing forwards between the gluteus medius and minimus, gives branches to both these muscles. Its terminal branch pierces the anterior fibres of the gluteus minimus, and ends in the tensor fasciae femoris. The Gluteus Minimus arises from the broad area on the dorsum ilii, which is included between the middle and inferior curved lines. The muscular fibres pass gradually into an aponeurotic tendon, which covers the superficial surface of the lower part of the muscle. This tendon as it descends narrows into a flattened band, which is inserted into a special impression on the anterior aspect of the great trochanter. It is intimately connected at its insertion with the capsule of the hip-joint. Parts under cover of the Gluteus Minimus.—The last step in the dissection of the gluteal region consists in the reflection of the gluteus minimus muscle. It must be detached from its origin and thrown downwards. Three objects are revealed by this dissection — (i) the capsular ligament of the hip-joint; (2) a bursa which intervenes between the tendon of the muscle and the great trochanter; (3) the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris. The capsular ligament will be seen to be only loosely attached to the posterior aspect of the neck of the femur, but very firmly to the acetabular brim. The synovial bursa should be opened and examined. The reflected tendon of

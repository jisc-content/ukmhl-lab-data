i8 THE UPPER LIMB. by the lower border of the pectoralis minor. The posterior fold is formed by the latissimus dorsi as it winds round the teres major muscle. Note at this stage that it is carried downwards to a lower level than the anterior fold. This, as we shall see later on, is a most important point in con- nection with the anatomy of the axilla. If the finger be pushed upwards into the axilla, the globular head of the humerus can be felt when the arm is rotated. One other point demands the attention of the student before the dissection is commenced, and that is, the position of the nipple. As a rule it lies superficial to the interspace be- tween the fourth and fifth ribs, and it is situated rather more than four inches from the middle line. Fig. 4. Reflection of Skin.—Incisions—(1) Along the middle line of the body from the upper margin of the manubrium sterni to the tip of the ensiform cartilage; (2) from the lower end of this vertical incision transversely outwards round the side of the body ; (3) from the upper extremity of the primary incision outwards along the clavicle to the extremity of the acromion process ; (4) from the lower end of the vertical and mesial incision {i.e., tip of the ensiform cartilage) obliquely upwards and outwards along the anterior fold of the axilla to the point at which this joins the upper arm. This last incision may, with ail van- tage, be carried vertically down the arm for two and a half or three inches.

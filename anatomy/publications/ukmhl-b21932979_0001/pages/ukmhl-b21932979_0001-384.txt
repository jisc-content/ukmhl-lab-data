ABDOMEN. backwards in the middle line of the body to within a short distance of the anus, and it gradually expands so as to form a bulbous posterior extremity. The corpus spongiosum, as it lies in the interval between the diverging crura, is therefore termed the bulb of the penis. The bulb rests upon the superficial aspect of the triangular ligament, and it is firmly bound down to this by an aponeurotic investment, which is prolonged over it from the ligament. Thej)os^ejMpx^x^rjnvi^ ofjhe^bjijbjsjipj^^ its originally double constitution. The bulb and the two crura together constitute the root of the penis, and each is provided with a special muscle, which at present hides it from view. Clothing the bulb the student will recognise a bipenniform muscle called the ejaculator urines, whilst moulded upon the surface of each cms is the erector penis muscle. These muscles should now be cleaned and their connections examined. Superficial Perineal Muscles.â€”Under this heading are included not only the ejaculator urinae and erector penis muscles, but also the transversus perinei. The superficial perineal muscles have been seen to lie within the pouch formed by the superficial fascia and the triangular ligament. When the superficial fascia is removed each will be found to be invested by its own delicate aponeurotic layer. The transversus perinei muscle is a narrow slip of muscular fibres which arises from the inner aspect of the ascending ramus of the ischium close to the tuberosity. It passes inwards and unites with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perineum. From this blending of the two muscles in the middle line it has occurred to some anatomists to describe them as together forming one digastric muscle, and certainly this mode of description is calculated to give a better idea of their action. By their simultaneous contraction they steady the central point of the perineum, and give support to the anus during defalcation.

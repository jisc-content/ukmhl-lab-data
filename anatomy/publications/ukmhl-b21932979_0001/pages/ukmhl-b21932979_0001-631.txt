599 PEL VIS. It also supplies the gemellus inferior and a branch to the hip-joint. The ftvigs to the pyriformis usually spring from the second and third sacral nerves. The visceral branches come from the third and fourth sacral nerves. Sacro-Coccygeal Plexus.—The fourth sacral nerve, as we have seen, sends upwards a branch to join the sacral plexus; it also sends a twig downwards to unite with the fifth sacral nerve. But in addition to these connecting branches, it gives off muscular and visceral branches, and also the per- forating cutaneous nerve. The muscular branches are distributed to three muscles —viz., the levator ani, the coccygeus, and the sphincter ani externus. The last of these has already been dissected in the perineum, under the name of the " perineal branch of the fourth sacral nerve." The visceral branches are numerous, and are directed inwards towards the viscera. Here they join with the pelvic plexus of nerves. Some, however, may be found entering the viscera directly. The third sacral nerve also gives off visceral branches. The perforating cutaneous nerve pierces the great sacro- sciatic ligament and then winds round the lower border of the gluteus maximus to gain the skin over the lower and inner part of that muscle. The fifth sacral nerve pierces the coccygeus. After being joined by the branch from the fourth sacral nerve, it turns downwards and unites with the coccygeal nerve. It supplies one or two minute filaments to the coccygeus muscle. The coccygeal nerve is a very delicate filament. It emerges from the lower end of the sacral canal, and makes its appear- ance by piercing the sacro-sciatic ligaments and the coccy- geus muscle. It is now joined by the fifth sacral nerve and runs downwards. Near the tip of the coccyx it is directed

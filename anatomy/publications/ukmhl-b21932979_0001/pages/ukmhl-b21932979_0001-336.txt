THE LOWER LIMB. 312 toes, and gives the collateral branches to their adjacent sides; and the fourth is disposed in a similar manner, and furnishes collateral branches to the contiguous margins of the second and third toes. Each of the inner three digital arteries, at its point of division, sends upwards in the interosseous space a minute anterior perforating branch, to join the corresponding dorsal interosseous branch of the metatarsal artery. Upon the sides of the toes the collateral branches are distributed in exactly the same manner as the correspond- ing arteries of the fingers. The Arteria Magna Hallucis (the plantar digital branch of the dorsal artery of the foot) corresponds with the arteria radialis indicis and the arteria princeps pollicis of the hand. It arises from the dorsal artery of the foot in the back part of the first interosseous space, and proceeds forwards to the cleft between the great toe and the second toe. Having supplied a branch to the inner side of the hallux, it divides into the collateral branches for the adjacent sides of the great toe and the second toe. The Deep Division of the External Plantar Nerve accompanies the plantar arch in its inward course across the sole, and ends in the deep surface of the adductor obliquus hallucis. In addition to this muscle, it supplies all the interosseous muscles, with the exception of those in the fourth space, the adductor transversus hallucis, and the three outer lumbrical muscles. The twig to the second lumbrical takes a recurrent course around the anterior border of the transversus pedis. Transverse Metatarsal Ligament. — The transversus pedis should now be detached from its origin, and thrown inwards towards the hallux. This brings into view the transverse metatarsal ligament — a strong fibrous band which stretches across the heads of the five metatarsal bones. It is attached to the inferior ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal joints. It differs from the corre-

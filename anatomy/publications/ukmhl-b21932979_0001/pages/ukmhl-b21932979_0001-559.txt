ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 527 both. The internal surface of each kidney lies upon the diaphragm in its upper third, and upon the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles in its lower two-thirds, separ- ated from these, however, by the fascia which covers them. The twelfth rib lies behind both. The right kidney does not, as a rule, extend beyond the upper border of this rib; the left kidney may reach the lower border of the eleventh rib, or even higher. The tipper end of each organ is capped by the suprarenal capsule, which also descends for a short distance on its anterior surface. The lower extremity is Fig. 116.—Outer surface of a model of the left kidney of a child of two years old. It shows the true form of the organ and the impressions for the viscera in contact with it. separated by a short interval1 of varying extent from the crest of the ilium. The relations special to each kidney may now be studied. Relations Peculiar to the Right Kidney.—The outer surface of the right kidney presents three impressions, viz., a 1 The extent of this interval is apparently dependent upon the level of the subcostal plane, or, in other words, the lateral depth of the thoracic wall. When the subcostal plane is placed at a high level the interval is wide; when it is placed at a low level the interval is very narrow, or perhaps the kidney is in actual relation to the iliac crest.

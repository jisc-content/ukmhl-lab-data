333 THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE FOOT. The bones which enter into these articulations are the seven tarsal bones, the metatarsal bones, and the pha- langes. The tarsal and metatarsal bones are bound to- gether by interosseous, plantar, and dorsal ligaments, and are disposed in the form of two arches, viz., a longitudinal and a transverse. The integrity of these arches is main- wm /.f 13 Fig. 62.â€”Vertical section through the foot, along a line stretching from the centre of the heel behind to the centre of the great toe in front.

Thick superficial fascia of heel. rained partly by the tension of the ligaments and partly by the direction of the articulating surfaces of the bones. The longitudinal arch presents a greater height and a wider span along the inner than along the outer side of the foot. The astragalus is placed on the summit of this arch and forms its keystone. The posterior pillar is short

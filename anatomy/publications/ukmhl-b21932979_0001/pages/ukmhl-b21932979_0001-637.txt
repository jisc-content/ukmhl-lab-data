605 PEL VIS. Coats of the Bladder.—The bladder presents the same coats as the intestine, viz. :— The serous covering is partial and confined to its superior part. The subserous coat consists of a thin stratum of areolar tissue which binds the peritoneum to the muscular coat. The vesical layer of pelvic fascia may be considered to thin away into this coat. The muscular tunic presents three layers of nonstriated muscular fibres, viz. :— The external longitudinal fibres, frequently termed the detrusor urince, give a continuous covering to the bladder, but are most apparent upon its anterior and posterior surfaces. In front, they may be considered to spring from the back of the pubic bones, the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, and the base of the prostate. From this they mount upwards and spread out upon the anterior surface of the bladder. At the apex, a few pass on to the urachus, but the majority are carried downwards over the posterior aspect and base of the bladder to the prostate, to which they are attached. The circular fibres give a very thin and sparse covering to the bladder. In direction they are more oblique than transverse. At the neck of the bladder they become con- tinuous with the fibres of the prostate. The internal longitudinal fibres constitute a very feeble layer. Over the lower part of the bladder the stratum is tolerably complete; but, as it is followed upwards, the fibres open out and become oblique.

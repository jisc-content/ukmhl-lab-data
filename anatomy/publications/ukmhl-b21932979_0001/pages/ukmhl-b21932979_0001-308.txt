284 THE LOWER LIMB. the inner aspect of the thigh and knee. It can now be exposed in its course along the inner side of the calf of the leg. It lies a short distance behind the internal border of the tibia. The external saphenous vein has been seen to arise from the outer end of the dorsal arch and to pass upwards behind the outer malleolus. It may now be fol- lowed as it ascends along the outer side of the tendo Achillis to the back of the leg, where it lies over the interval between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. When it gains the lower part of the popliteal space it pierces the deep fascia and joins the popliteal vein. Associated with each of these veins are certain cutaneous nerves, which must be displayed at the same time. The small sciatic is closely related to the external saphenous vein in its upper part, and the externa/ saphenous nerve accompanies it in the lower half of the leg. In company with the internal saphenous vein we find the interfial or long saphenous nerve. Cutaneous Nerves.—These are very numerous. On the inner side of the leg are—(1) the internal or long saphenous ; (2) the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous; and (3) the internal calcanean. The guide to the internal saphenous nerve is the vein ot the same name. It may now be exposed in its entire course along the inner side of the leg. The posterior branch of the ititertial cutaneous proceeds downwards a short dis- tance behind the preceding nerve. It usually ends about the middle of the leg. The internal calcanean is a branch of the posterior tibial nerve. Dissect for it in the interval between the prominence of the heel and internal malleolus. It pierces the internal annular ligament nearer the former than the latter. Its distribution to the skin of the heel and sole will be seen in a future dissection. In the middle line of the leg two nerves will be found, viz.—(1) the small sciatic, and (2) the nervus communicans tibialis. They have both been previously seen in the

ABDOMEN. 590 Branches of the Internal Iliac.—The branches of this artery spring from the two divisions into which it divides, and may be tabulated thus :— Anterior Division. Posterior Division. Parietal. Visceral. Parietal. Visceral. 1. Obturator. 2. Internal pudic. 3. Sciatic. 1. Superior vesical. 2. Inferior vesical. 3. Middle hemor- rhoidal. 1. Iliolumbar. 2. Gluteal. 3. Lateral sacral. Superior Vesical (arterise vesicales superiores).—Under this name are included two or three small twigs which spring from the pervious part of the obliterated hypogastric artery, and proceed forwards in the posterior false ligament of the bladder to the coats of that viscus. They supply the apex and the greater part of the body of the bladder, and from one of them a minute twig, the artery to the vas deferens (arteria deferentialis), is given to the seminal duct. Al- though exceedingly slender, this branch can be followed along the vas as far as the testicle. Inferior Vesical (arteria vesicalis inferior).—This artery will be recognised from its distribution. It ramifies upon the base of the bladder, and sends twigs to the vesiculas seminales. A branch called the vesico-prostatic also takes origin from the inferior vesical, and runs downwards upon the lateral lobe of the prostate to supply its substance. The middle hczmorrhoidal (arteria haemorrhoidalis media) almost invariably proceeds from the inferior vesical. It is given to the coats of the rectum, and anastomoses above with the superior hemorrhoidal termination of the inferior

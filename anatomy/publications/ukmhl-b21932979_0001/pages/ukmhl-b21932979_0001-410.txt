386 ABDOMEN. curve is directed forwards. So close is its relation to the anterior wall of the vagina, that it may almost be said to be embedded in it. At the present stage of the dissection, the urethral canal is seen to be covered by the fibres of the compressor urethrse muscle. The leading peculiarity of the female urethra is its great dilatability. Cases are on record in which vesical calculi weighing from two to four ounces have traversed it, and thus escaped from the bladder. It thus happens that in the extraction of foreign substances from the female bladder, it is rarely necessary to have recourse to the knife. Compressor Urethrse.—This muscle differs somewhat from the corresponding muscle in the male. It has the same origin (viz., from the inner aspect of the pubic arch at the junction of the pubic and ischial rami), and it also divides into two bundles; but these have not the same intimate relation to the urethra. The upper or anterior bundle spreads out upon the upper or anterior surface of the urethra, whilst the lower or posterior bundle spreads out upon the wall of the vagina. The Vagina will be fully described in connection with the pelvic viscera. Bartholin's Glands.—These glands are the representa- tives in the female of Cowper's glands in the male. They are two round or oblong bodies about the size of a horse- bean, placed one upon each side of the entrance to the vagina immediately behind the rounded end of the bulb, and under cover of the sphincter vaginas. A long duct pro- ceeds from each gland, and opens in the angle between the nympha and the hymen or caruncuke myrtiformes (Fig. 74,. P- 378). Internal Pudic Vessels and Nerve.—The internal pudic vessels and nerve have a precisely similar disposition to the corresponding vessels and nerve in the male (p. 369). If anything, they are somewhat smaller. The student must therefore look for the artery to the

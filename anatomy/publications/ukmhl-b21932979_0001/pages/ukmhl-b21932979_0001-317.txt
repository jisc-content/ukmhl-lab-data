293 POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. internal to the vertical ridge, which descends from the oblique line. It also derives fibres from the surface of the aponeurosis which covers the tibialis posticus. Crossing the lower part of the tibialis posticus, its tendon grooves the back of the internal malleolus on the outer side of the tendon of that muscle. It is continued under cover of the internal annular ligament into the sole of the foot. The Tibialis Posticus takes origin from the posterior sur- face of the interosseous membrane, from the posterior part of the inner surface of the shaft of the fibula, from the tibialis anticus. interior tibial vessels and nerve. ext. long, hallucis. ext. long, digilorum. peroneal artery, peroneus longus.

In Fig. 55 the compartment which it occupies is shown in a diagrammatic manner, and the surfaces from which it takes origin are indicated. To- wards the lower part of the leg the tibialis posticus inclines inwards under cover of the flexor longus digitorum, and its strong flattened tendon grooves the back of the internal malleolus to the inner side of the tendon of that muscle.

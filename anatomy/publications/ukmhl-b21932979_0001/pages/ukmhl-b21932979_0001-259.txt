FRONT OF THE THIGH. 235 inserted into the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, behind the anterior tubercle. By its lower border this tendon is connected with the fascia of the leg, whilst by its upper border it is joined to the capsule of the knee- joint. In its upper oblique part the sartorius muscle forms the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangle, and lies in front of the iliacus, the rectus femoris, and the adductor longus muscles. Below this, it is placed over the femoral vessels as far as the u.i. ue. Fig. 46.—Transverse section through Hunter's canal. / Femur. s. Sartorius. a.l. Adductor longus. v. i. Vastus internus. f.c.

At its insertion its expanded tendon lies in front of, and covers, the tendons of insertion of the gracilis and semitendinosus, but is separated from them by a bursa. Hunter's Canal.—When the femoral artery leaves Scarpa's triangle it is continued downwards on the inner side of the thigh, in a deep furrow, which is bounded on the outer side by the vastus internus muscle, and on the inner side by the

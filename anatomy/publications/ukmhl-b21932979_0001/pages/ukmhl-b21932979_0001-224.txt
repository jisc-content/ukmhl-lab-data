THE LOWER LIMB. 200 The branches of the popliteal artery are :â€” 1. Muscular. 2. Cutaneous. 3. Articular. The muscular branches consist of an upper and a lower set. The upper branches are distributed to the hamstring muscles near their insertions. The lower branches, termed the sural arteries, end chiefly in the two heads of the gas- trocnemius ; but small twigs also go to the soleus and plantaris. The cutaneous branch, called the superficial sural, usually arises from one of the sural muscular branches, and supplies the integument over the upper part of the calf of the leg. It lies in the groove between the two heads of the gas- trocnemius with the nervus communicans tibialis. The articular arteries are five in number, viz., two superior, two inferior, and one median or azygos. The Superior Articular Arteries spring from the main trunk as it passes between the condyles of the femur. One proceeds from each side of the popliteal, and they are called intertial and external, according to the direction which they take. They will be found resting directly upon the back of the femur, and will be observed to incline slightly upwards, and then to wind round the bone immediately above the condyles. The external artery is the larger of the two. The student is apt to mistake a muscular branch for one or other of these vessels; but their close apposition to the femur should in all cases be sufficient to distinguish them. The superior external articular artery (a. genu superior lateralis) runs outwards under cover of the biceps, and disappears from the popliteal space by piercing the external intermuscular septum and entering the substance of the crureus muscle. The superior internal articular (a. genu superior medialis) proceeds inwards under cover of the semimembranosus, and leaves the popliteal space by passing

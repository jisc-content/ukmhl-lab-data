ABDOMEN. 556 nate bone, is the obturator internus muscle; whilst, in fro7it, lying against the deep surface of the triangular ligament, is the compressor urethra muscle. But, in addition, there is a strong aponeurotic membrane, called the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, which forms a com- plete lining for the pelvis, and is placed upon the deep surface of these muscles. The pelvic wall may therefore be regarded as consisting of three strata, each composed of parts which lie in the same morphological plane, viz. :— 1. A bony, ligamentous, and membranous stratum. 2. A muscular stratum. 3. An aponeurotic stratum. The pelvic cavity is closed below, and separated from the perineum by the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which passes inwards to the viscera from the parietal layer of the same aponeurosis, and also by the pelvic diaphragm, which is placed upon the under surface of the fascia. This diaphragm consists of the two levatores ani muscles and the two coccygei muscles. The pelvic and abdominal cavities are directly continuous above and in front through the pelvic inlet. The contents of the pelvic cavity differ in the two sexes ; in both, however, the bladder occupies the forepart, and the rectum the back part of the space. The difference is to be found in the generative organs. It is necessary, therefore, to describe the male and female pelvis separately. Within tures:— Male Pelvis. the male pelvis we find the following struc- Viscera. 1. The rectum. 2. The bladder, with the lower portion of the ureters, the prostate, and the prostatic portion of the urethra. 3. Vasa deferentia and the vesiculce seminales.

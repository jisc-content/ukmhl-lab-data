100 THE UPPER LIMB. the supinator longus on the outside, and the flexor carpi radialis upon the inner side, and this'position it maintains as far as the wrist. Where these muscles are fleshy the artery lies at some depth from the surface; but when the tendons make their appearance it assumes a superficial position, and is merely covered by the integument and fasciae. Throughout its whole length it is closely accom- panied by the venaz comites, and the radial nerve lies along its outer side in the middle third of the forearm. Above this, the nerve is separated from the vessel by a slight interval, whilst below, the nerve leaves the artery by turning round the outer margin of the forearm under cover of the supinator longus. Posteriorly the radial artery is supported by the muscles which clothe and find attachment to the front of the radius. At its origin it rests upon the tendon of the biceps; next it lies in front of the supinator brevis, with some adipose tissue intervening; from this downwards it is in contact with the pronator radii teres, the thin radial head of the flexor sublimis, the flexor longus pollicis, the pronator quadratus, and lastly, the lower end of the radius. The radial artery is usually selected for the determination of the pulse. By placing the tips of the fingers upon the lower part of the forearm, in the interval between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, the pulsations of the vessel in the living person can readily be felt. Branches of the Radial Artery.—In the forearm the radial artery gives off the following branches, viz. :— 1. The radial recurrent. 2. The superficialis volte. 3. The anterior radial carpal. 4. Muscular. The muscular branches are very numerous, and proceed from the radial artery at irregular points throughout its whole course in the forearm. The radial recurre?it artery is a branch of some size. It

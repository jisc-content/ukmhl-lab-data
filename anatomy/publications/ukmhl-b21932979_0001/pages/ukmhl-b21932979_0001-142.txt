The nerve twigs to the two outer lumbricals must also be looked for carefully. They spring from the digital branches of the median, which go to the rajJiaJ_^jide_jDf^th^ jyid^_Jo__ih£__c^eft between the index and middle jinggrs. In order that the digital vessels and nerves may be traced to their distribution, the skin must be reflected from the fingers. This can be done by making an incision along the middle of each digit, and turning the integument outwards and inwards. As the skin is raised from the lateral aspects of the different digits the cutaneous ligaments of the phalanges (Cleland) will come into view. These are fibrous bands, which spring from the edges of the phalanges behind the digital vessels and nerves. They are inserted into the skin so as to form a strong fibrous septum on each side of each finger. They retain the integu- ment in proper position during the different movements of the digits. Superficial Palmar Arch.—The ulnar artery, when traced into the palm, is found to form the superficial palmar arch— an arterial arcade, which lies immediately subjacent to the deep fascia. Detach the slip of fascia which binds the vessel to the front of the annular ligament. The arch is now exposed in its whole length. The ulnar artery enters the palm by passing downwards in front of the annular ligament, close to the outer side of the pisiform bone. A short distance below this it curves outwards, across the palm, and, near the middle of the thenar eminence, it is joined by the superficialis volse branch of the radial, oi)l3!m£_jre£uemly^^ &e^£tsrja_ra4Mis_in^ The convexity of the arch is directed downwards towards the fingers, and its lowest point corresponds with a line drawn across the palm from the lower border of the outstretched thumb. Throughout its entire extent the superficial palmar arch lies very near the surface. Its inner part is covered by the palmaris brevis muscle; beyond this it is placed immedi- ately behind the central part of the palmar fascia. As it

THE UPPER LIMB. 84 BACK OF THE ARM. In this region the following are the structures which require to be studied :— 1. The triceps muscle. 2. The superior profunda artery, and the musculo-spiral nerve. 3. The inferior profunda artery, and the ulnar nerve. 4. The posterior branch of the anastomotic artery. 5. The subanconeus muscle. Dissection.—The skin has already been removed from the back of the arm. The deep fascia should now be raised from the surface of the triceps muscle, and its three heads cleaned and isolated from each other. To place the muscle on the stretch, the inferior angle of the scapula should be raised as high as possible, and the forearm flexed at the elbow-joint. The musculo-spiral nerve, together with the superior profunda artery, must at the same time receive the attention of the dissector. They should be followed backwards between the heads of the triceps and all their branches should be carefully preserved. Triceps Extensor Cubiti (m. triceps brachii). — This muscle occupies the entire posterior osteo-fascial compart- ment of the upper arm. It arises by a long or middle head from the scapula, and by two short heads, outer and innery from the humerus. The fleshy fibres of these three heads join a common tendon, which is inserted into the top of the olecranon process of the ulna. The superficial part of the muscle is, for the most part, formed by the long scapular head and the outer humeral head of the muscle. The inner humeral head is deeply placed; only a very small portion of it appears superficially in the lower part of the arm on each side of the common tendon of insertion. The long or scapular head (caput longum) of the triceps arises by a flattened tendon, which spreads out so as to enclose the muscular substance of the fleshy belly, from the rough triangular impression on the upper part of the axillary border and the lower aspect of the neck of the scapula. This tendon takes origin in the interval between

484 ABDOMEN. parts of the intestinal canal which are supplied by branches from the superior mesenteric artery, and also the right gastro-epiploic vein from the great curvature of the stomach. Leaving the mesentery, it passes upwards in front of the duodenum, and then disappears under cover of the pancreas. Here it unites with the splenic vein to form the vena porta. The Superior Mesenteric Nervous Plexus is a dense plexus of sympathetic twigs, which surrounds the superior mesenteric artery like a sheath. From it filaments are prolonged to the gut along the various branches of the artery. As the nerves approach the bowel, some of the twigs leave the vessels and effect a series of communications with each other in the intervals between the arteries. The superior mesenteric plexus is an offshoot from the solar plexus, and it distributes twigs to the jejunum, ileum, and to the right half of the great intestine. Mesenteric Lymphatic Glands.â€”These are very numerous, indeed considerably over a hundred in number. In health they rarely attain a size greater than that of a bean or a pea, and they are scattered between the two layers of the mesentery. The larger glands lie along the superior mesenteric artery, whilst the others are placed in the in- tervals between its branches. It should be noted that they are most numerous opposite the jejunum, and that the mesentery in the immediate vicinity of the gut is free from them. A few lymphatic glands will also be noticed in connection with the great intestine. The lacteal vessels enter the mesentery from the walls of the intestine in enormous numbers. As they proceed up- wards they pass through the succession of glands which they meet, and greatly reduced in numbers, although considerably enlarged in calibre, they usually terminate near the origin of the superior mesenteric artery in one or perhaps more large trunks which pour their contents into the receptaculum chyli of the thoracic duct.

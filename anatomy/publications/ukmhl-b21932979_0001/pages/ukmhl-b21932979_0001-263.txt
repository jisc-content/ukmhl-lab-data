239 FRONT OF THE THIGH. plane. The crossing from one side to the other takes place behind the artery and is very gradual, so that for a consider- able distance the femoral vein lies directly behind the femoral artery. For a distance of two inches below Poupart's ligament it is enclosed within the femoral sheath, of which it occupies the middle compartment. In its journey up the thigh the femoral vein receives tributaries which for the most part correspond with the branches of the femoral artery. At the saphenous opening it is joined by the internal saphenous vein. The dissector should slit it open with the scissors. Several valves will then be seen. One is almost invariably found immediately above the entrance of the vein which corresponds to the profunda artery. Anterior Crural Nerve.—The anterior crural nerve is a large nerve which arises within the abdomen from the lumbar plexus. It enters the thigh by passing downwards in the interval between the psoas and iliacus muscles and behind Poupart's ligament and the fascia iliaca. In the upper part of the thigh it lies to the outer side of the femoral artery, and is separated from it by a small portion of the psoas muscle and the femoral sheath.. A short distance below Poupart's ligament it divides into an anterior and a posterior portion, which at once resolve themselves into a large number of cutaneous and muscular branches. The following is a list of these :— Anterior division, Posterior division, Muscular branches, Cutaneous branches, Muscular branches, Cutaneous branch, Articular branches. f To the pectineus. \ sartorius. j Middle cutaneous.

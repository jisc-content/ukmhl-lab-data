INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. 255 insertion of the adductor magnus for the passage of the perforating arteries. The opening through which the femoral artery enters the popliteal space lies in series with these. It is a gap between the two portions of the muscle, and is situated in the lower third of the thigh. The adductor magnus has a double nerve supply. Be- hind, it is supplied by branches from the great sciatic, whilst in front it receives the greater part of the posterior division of the obturator. Dissection.—The adductor magnus should now be detached from its origin, in order that the obturator externus muscle and the obturator artery may be more fully examined. Obturator Externus—Obturator Artery.—The obturator externus is a flat, fan-shaped muscle, which is placed over the front of the thyroid foramen of the innominate bone. It springs from the inner half of the membrane which closes the foramen, and also from the inner and lower part of its bony rrrargin. It proceeds backwards and outwards below the neck of the femur and the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, and ends in a stout tendon which obtains inser- tion into the digital fossa at the root of the great trochanter. This tendon has already been noticed in the dissection of the gluteal region. The obturator artery appears in the thigh through the upper part of the thyroid foramen of the innominate bone. It at once divides into two terminal branches, which diverge from each other, and form an arterial circle upon the thyroid membrane, under cover of the obturator exter- nus. This muscle must therefore be detached in order that these vessels may be followed. Both branches give twigs to the neighbouring muscles, whilst the outer branch (i.e., the branch which runs round the outer side of the foramen) sends an articular twig through the cotyloid notch of the acetabulum into the hip-joint. When the joint is opened this twig may be followed, in a well-injected

54 THE UPPER LIMB. The Circumflex Nerve accompanies the posterior circum- flex artery, and supplies—(a) muscular branches to the deltoid and teres minor; (b) cutaneous branches to the skin over the lower part of the deltoid; and (c) an articular twig to the shoulder-joint. The following is the manner in which it is distributed. It springs from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and turning round the lower border of the subscapularis, proceeds backwards with the posterior cir- cumflex artery in the quadrilateral space. Reaching the posterior aspect of the limb, it divides into an anterior and Fig. 14.—Diagram of the circumflex vessels and nerve. H.

The articular branch takes origin from the trunk of the nerve, and enters the joint below the subscapularis muscle. The posterior division gives off the branch to the teres minor, and after furnishing a few twigs to the posterior part of the deltoid, is continued onwards as the cutaneous nerve which has already been dissected in the superficial fascia over the lower part of the deltoid (Fig. 14). The nerve to the teres minor is distinguished

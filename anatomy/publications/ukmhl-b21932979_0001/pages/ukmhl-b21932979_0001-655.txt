623 PEL VIS. reflected on to the posterior wall of the upper part of the vagina, upon which it ascends to the posterior surface of the uterus, which it covers completely. Reaching the fundus of the uterus, it turns over this and descends upon the anterior aspect of the organ. This surface of the uterus it only invests in its upper three-fourths, and is then reflected on to the posterior aspect of the blad- der. Whilst the vagina, therefore, receives a partial investment from the peri- toneum posteriorly, it is altogether destitute of it an- teriorly ; and, again, whilst the entire posterior surface of the uterus is covered, the lower fourth of its an- terior surface is bare, in so far as this membrane is concerned. From each lateral border of the uterus the peritoneum stretches outwards in the form of a wide fold, called the broad ligament. This connects the organ to the wall of the pelvis and the iliac fossa. Upon the bladder the peritoneum is carried upwards, and at its apex is conducted to the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall by the urachus. On each side of the viscus it extends outwards as far as the obliterated hypogastric artery, along the line of which it quits the bladder, and is continued on to the pelvic Fig. 144.â€”Horizontal section through the urethra, vagina, and anal canal, a short distance above their termina- tions.

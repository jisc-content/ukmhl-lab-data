ABDOMEN. 520 leads downwards into the gastric fossa on the under surface of the left lobe. This groove lodges the oesophagus. Beyond the oesophageal groove the posterior surface of the left lobe merges with the sharp margin of the organ. On the posterior surface of the right lobe—(i) the lobulus Spigelii; (2) the fissure for the inferior vena cava; and (3) an extensive bare area uncovered by peritoneum, may be recognised. The lobulus Spigelii is the portion of liver substance which Fig. 113.—Lower and posterior surfaces of a liver which has lost its proper form from being placed on a plane surface.

The Spigelian lobe forms the bottom of the vertebral hollow,

Superiorly, its walls are firmly attached to the substance of the uterus around its neck, upon which it ascends to a higher level behind than in front; on account of this, the cervix uteri has the appear- ance of piercing its anterior wall. The vagina is wider in the middle than at either end, and the anterior and posterior walls are closely applied to each other, so that in no respect can the vagina be regarded as an open tube or canal.

Below this it is in apposition with the second part of the rectum, the recto-vaginal layer of pelvic fascia intervening. Still lower down, it is separated from the third part of the rectum

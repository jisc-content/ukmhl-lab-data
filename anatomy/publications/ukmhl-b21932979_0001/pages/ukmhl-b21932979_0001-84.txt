6o THE UPPER LIMB. scapular branch of the axillary, and enter the triangular space. While here, it supplies one or two ventral branches, which pass under cover of the subscapularis muscle to the venter scapulae, and a larger infrascapular branch which runs downwards in the interval between the teres major and minor to the inferior angle of the scapula (Fig. 13). After these branches are given off, the dorsalis scapulae leaves the triangular space by turning round the axillary border of the scapula, under cover of the teres minor. It now enters the infraspinous fossa, where it ramifies and supplies branches to the infraspinatus muscle. Anastomosis around the Scapula.—A very important and free anastomosis takes place around the scapula. Three main blood vessels take part in this, viz.—(a) the supra- scapular ; (b) the posterior scapular; and (c) the sub- scapular. The posterior scapular artery runs downwards in relation to the base or vertebral border of the scapula, and dis- penses branches upon both the dorsal and ventral aspects of the bone. The subscapular artery runs downwards and inwards along the axillary border of the scapula, and at the inferior angle some of its terminal branches anastomose with the terminal twigs of the posterior scapular. The supra- scapular artery at the upper margin of the scapula is brought into communication with the posterior scapular by an anastomosis in the neighbourhood of the superior angle of the bone. But still more distinct anastomoses take place upon the dorsal and ventral aspects of the bone. In the supra- spinous fossa branches of the suprascapular inosculate with twigs from the posterior scapular; whilst in the infra- spinous fossa free communications are established between the dorsalis scapulae, the suprascapular, and the posterior scapular. On the ventral aspect of the scapula, the ventral branch of the suprascapular, the ventral branches of the dorsalis

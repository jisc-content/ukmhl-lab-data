ABDOMEN. 644 tube. The ligament of the ovary, a much more slender band, is a fibrous cord containing some muscular tissue derived from the wall of the uterus. It extends from the lower uterine pole of the ovary to the body of the uterus, which it joins immediately behind and a little below the entrance of the Fallopian tube. In all its length, it is enclosed between the two layers of the broad ligament. The wall of the uterus is very thick, and presents three well-marked coats, viz., a serous or peritoneal, a muscular, and a mucous. The serous covering has already been fully Fig. 153.—Interior of the Uterus (Luschka). studied. The muscular part of the wall constitutes its chief bulk. It is composed of involuntary muscular tissue, with a considerable admixture of areolar tissue. It is not equally thick throughout. Thus it becomes distinctly thinner towards the angles at the entrance of the Fallopian tubes. The mucous lining will be studied after the interior of the organ has been examined. Interior of the Uterus.—The cavity in the interior of the uterus is much smaller than would be naturally expected from the size of the organ. It is subdivided arbitrarily into

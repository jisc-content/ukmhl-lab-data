In each of the four fingers the same condition is found; the tendon of the flexor sublimis is inserted by two slips into the sides of the second phalanx, whilst the tendon of the flexor pro- Fig. 30.—Flexor tendons of the finger, with the vincula accessoria.

Tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis.—This tendon proceeds downwards in the interval between two of the muscles of the thumb (viz., the superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the adductor obliquus pollicis), and also in the interval between the two sesamoid bones 1 Where the margins of the two slips of the tendon of the flexor sublimis are united behind the tendon of the flexor profundus, a decussation of fibres takes place between the two slips, which greatly strengthens the insertion.

FOREARM AND HAND. 131 and the ridge on the front of the trapezium. Its fibres spread out, and are inserted into the entire length of the radial border of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its nerve of supply is derived from the median. The adductor obliqitus pollitis arises from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and likewise from the os magnum, the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis. From this origin the muscle proceeds downwards along the inner side of the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. A strong slip will generally be seen to deviate outwards from the outer border of the muscle. This passes under cover of the long flexor tendon, and joins the superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The adductor obliquus is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The adductor transversus pollicis has a wide origin from the anterior face of the lower two-thirds of the shaft of the middle metacarpal bone, and from the fascia covering the interosseous muscles. Its fibres converge as they pass out- wards, and are inserted along with the adductor obliquus into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. It is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Two sesamoid bones are developed in connection with the tendons of the short muscles of the thumb as they are inserted on either side of the base of the proximal phalanx. Short Muscles of the Little Finger.â€”The abductor minimi digiti lies on the inner and superficial aspect of the hypo- thenar eminence, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti upon its outer side. On separating these from each other, the opponens minimi digiti is seen on a deeper plane, and in the interval between them. The abductor minimi digiti arises from the pisiform bone, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the

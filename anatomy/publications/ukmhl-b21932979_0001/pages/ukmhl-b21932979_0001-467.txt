443 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. the artery is the dorsal nerve. On the dorsum of the penis, therefore, we find one vein, two arteries, and two nerves. The dorsal vein of the penis begins by several twigs from the glans and prepuce. It extends backwards in the middle line, and disappears between the two layers of the suspensory ligament. It gains the pelvis by passing under the sub- pubic ligament, and ends by joining the prostatic plexus of veins. The dorsal arteries are the terminal twigs of the internal pudic vessels. Piercing the triangular ligament, they pass forward between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, and, continuing their course on the dorsum of the penis, they terminate in branches for the glans penis. The dorsal nerves are branches of the internal pudic. They have a similar course to the arteries, and end in fine twigs to the papillae of the glans. ABDOMINAL CAVITY. The abdominal cavity may now be opened completely by carrying an incision from the umbilicus upwards to the ensiform cartilage. On throwing the two flaps thus formed upwards and outwards over the lower margin of the thorax, a strong fibrous cord, the obliterated umbilical vein, will be observed extending from the umbilicus to the under surface of the liver. The obliterated umbilical vein also receives the name of the round ligament, or ligamenlum teres, of the liver. As it ascends towards that organ, it gradually recedes from the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall, taking with it a fold of peritoneum, termed the falciform ligament of the liver. Shape and Boundaries of the Abdominal Cavity.â€”The abdominal cavity is ovoid in shape, its vertical diameter being the longest. Superiorly, it is roofed by the dome-

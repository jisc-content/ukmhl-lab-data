PERONEAL REGION. the tendon of the peroneus brevis lies directly under cover of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and therefore in contact with the bone. On the outer surface of the os calcis the tendon of the peroneus brevis is placed at a higher level than that of its fellow muscle. As the tendons of the two peronei muscles proceed downwards in the hollow between the external malleolus and the posterior prominence of the os calcis they are held in place by the external annular ligament, and their move- ments are facilitated by the presence of a common synovial sheath. On the outer surface of the os calcis each tendon is retained in position by a separate fibrous sheath, into which the common synovial membrane is prolonged. The peroneal tubercle of the os calcis intervenes between these two sheaths. External Popliteal Nerve.â€”This nerve has previously been traced as far as the neck of the fibula. At this point it disappears from view by passing forwards between the peroneus longus muscle and the bone. The muscle must therefore be carefully turned aside from its origin in order that the nerve may be followed out. It will be found to give off a small recurrent articular nerve to the knee-joint, and then to divide into the anterior tibial and musculo- cutaneous nerves. The recurrent branch accompanies the anterior recurrent tibial artery. It turns upwards in the fibres of the tibialis anticus. To the upper part of this muscle it gives several twigs, whilst its terminal filaments gain the front of the knee-joint. The anterior tibial nerve pierces the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum to reach the front of the leg, where it has already been dissected. The Musculocutaneous Nerve proceeds downwards in the substance of the peroneus longus. It reaches the interval between the two peronei muscles, gives branches to both, and lastly comes to lie between the peroneus

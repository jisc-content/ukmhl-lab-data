37S ABDOMEN. the anterior commissure, and surmounted by a sensitive rounded tubercle called the glans, but it is not traversed by the urethra. The manner in which its prepuce and frsenum are formed has already been described. To obtain a proper view of the clitoris the student must lay hold of the glans with the forceps and draw it out from the prepuce. Vestibule.—The dissector should next take note of a smooth triangular interval which exists between the clitoris and the entrance to the vagina. The term vestibule is given to this area. It is bounded laterally by the nymphse, and towards its lower part or base is seen the orifice of the urethra. The triangular outline of the vestibule is only seen when the labia are forcibly drawn apart from each other. In the natural condition of parts the labia are in close apposition, and the vestibule is then a deep recess which represents the bottom of the pudendal cleft, between the clitoris and the vagina. The Urethral Orifice lies close to the opening of the vagina, about one inch below the clitoris. It is circular in form, and the mucous membrane around it is prominent, pouting and slightly puckered, so that when the tip of the finger is passed over the vestibular area the opening can readily be distinguished by touch. The Vaginal Orifice, in the virgin, is partially closed by the hymen—a semi-lunar fold of mucous membrane at- tached to the posterior aspect and sides of the entrance to the vagina, and presenting a free concave margin towards the pubes. The form of the hymen, however, is very variable. Sometimes it is present in the shape of a septum attached around the entire circumference of the vaginal entrance, but pierced in the centre by a circular opening or a vertical slit; again, it may be cribriform or fringed along its free margin. Lastly, it may constitute a complete sep- tum across the opening of the vaginal canal. In this case awkward results ensue from the retention of the

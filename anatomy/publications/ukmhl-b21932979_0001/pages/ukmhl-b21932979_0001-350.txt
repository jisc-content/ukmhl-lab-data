326 THE LOWER LIMB. and outwards, to gain attachment to the posterior part of the inner surface of the external condyle of the femur. The posterior, crucial ligament springs from the posterior sloping part of the intermediate rough area on the upper surface of the tibia, behind the tibial spine, and behind also the attachments of the posterior horns of both semi- lunar cartilages. It proceeds upwards, forwards, and some- what inwards, and, crossing the anterior crucial ligament, is attached in the fore part of the intercondyloid fossa to the outer surface of the anterior oblique portion of the internal condyle. It receives one, or sometimes two, strong slips from the posterior horn of the external semilunar cartilage. The anterior crucial ligament is tight in extension, and the posterior crucial ligament is tight in flexion of the knee-joint. Semilunar Cartilages.—These are two crescentic plates of fibro-cartilage which are placed on the condylar surfaces of the tibia. They deepen the surfaces upon which the condyles of the femur roll, and, being movable, they fill up the gaps which would otherwise arise during the move- ments of the joint. Each cartilage presents two fibrous extremities, or horns, which are attached to the rough intermediate surface on the upper end of the tibia. They are thick towards the circumference of the joint, but thin away to a fine free concave edge in the opposite direction. Both surfaces are smooth and covered with synovial mem- brane. They do not cover the entire extent of the condylar surfaces of the tibia. The central parts of the latter, as well as the sloping surfaces of the tubercles of the tibial spine, are free. On raising the cartilages from the surface upon which they rest, distinct impressions similar in shape and extent are seen on the subjacent encrusting cartilage of the tibia. Dissection.—Carefully define the attachments of the fibrous horns of the semilunar cartilages. The external semilunar cartilage is usually somewhat

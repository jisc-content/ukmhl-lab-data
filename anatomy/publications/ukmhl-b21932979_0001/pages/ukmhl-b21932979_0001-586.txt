554 ABDOMEN. The Last Dorsal Nerve.—The anterior primary division of this nerve will be found running outwards in front of the quadratus lumborum, and under cover of the fascia spread over that muscle, along the lower border of the last rib. Near the spine it sends a small offset downwards to the first lumbar nerve, and at the outer border of the quadratus lumborum it pierces the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis, and then passes forwards in the abdominal wall between this muscle and the internal oblique. Its course and distribution in the wall of the abdomen have already been described (pp. 394, 407). Lumbar Arteries (arteriae lumbales).—These have been traced to the inner border of the psoas. They are now observed to pass backwards behind this muscle to the intervals between the transverse processes of the vertebrae. Here each ends by dividing into a dorsal and an abdominal branch. The dorsal branch runs backwards between the transverse processes, and, after giving a spinal branch, which enters the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen, ends in the muscles and integument of the back. The abdominal branches, with the exception of the first, proceed outwards behind the quadratus lumborum, and are then directed forwards between the abdominal muscles, where they anastomose, above with the intercostal arteries, below with the deep circumflex iliac and ilio-lumbar arteries, and in front with the superior and deep epigastric arteries. The first abdominal branch passes in front of the quadratus lumborum, in company with the anterior primary division of the last dorsal nerve. The Lumbar Veins accompany the corresponding arteries, and pour their blood into the inferior vena cava. The veins of the left side pass behind the aorta. In front of the transverse processes of the vertebra;, cross branches link together the different lumbar veins on each side of the vertebral column, and form a continuous longitudinal vessel,

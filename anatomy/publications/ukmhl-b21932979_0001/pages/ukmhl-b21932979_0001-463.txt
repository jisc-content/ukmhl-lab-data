It is consequently mainly the duty of the student who is engaged in the dissection of the lower limb, and within whose domain the femoral sheath lies, to in- vestigate the anatomical connections of this variety of hernia (p. 227). Still it is essential that the dissector of the abdomen should examine, from its abdominal aspect, the crural ring or aperture of communication be- tween the crural canal and the abdominal cavity, and give the dissector of the lower limb an opportunity of doing so likewise. The crural ring is placed immediately behind Poupart's ligament, in Fig. 90.â€”Diagram to illustrate the four different varie- ties of infantile hernia. (After Lockwood.) A.

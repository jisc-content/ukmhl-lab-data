524 ABDOMEN. of the organ, and cannot be said to have any course outside the liver, as they open directly into the vena cava inferior. The vena cava should be slit open, when the wide gaping mouths of the terminal hepatic veins will be displayed. Trace these veins for a short distance into the substance of the gland. They are remarkable for the tenuity of their walls, and also for the very small quantity of areolar tissue which separates them from the hepatic substance: indeed this is so scarce that it is hardly appreciable to the naked eye. In the case of the smaller veins it is altogether absent, and the hepatic lobules rest directly upon their wall. A section should now be made through the liver sub- stance and the cut surface examined. The portal veins can be readily distinguished from the hepatic veins. The following are the points of difference :— Portal Veins. 1. Are always accompanied by a branch of duct and a branch of hepatic artery. 2. Mouths usually collapsed. 3. Walls thicker. 4. Walls separated from the liver substance by Glisson's cap- sule. Hepatic Veins. 1. Are solitary and not accom- panied by any other vessel. 2. Mouths usually open and gaping. 3. Walls exceedingly thin. 4. Walls apparently in direct apposition with the liver substance. Structure of the Liver.—Very little of the structure of the liver can be learned in the dissecting-room. It is completely enveloped by a fibro-areolar coat. This is thick where the peritoneum is absent; but very thin where that membrane is spread over the gland. The liver substance presents a mottled appearance, and when torn or ruptured the surface exhibits a granular aspect. The minute particles which give rise to this appearance are the hepatic lobules. In the human liver these are not completely separated from each other. Each lobule may be regarded as a miniature liver; they are all built up of the same con-

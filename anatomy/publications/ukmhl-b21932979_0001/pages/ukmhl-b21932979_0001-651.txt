A slight amount of movement can take place—the sacrum moving round an imaginary line drawn transversely through its second piece from one side to the other. In the erect posture the promontory of the sacrum is with- drawn to the full extent from the symphysis ; in bending the body forwards, it approaches, in a small degree, the symphysis, and, in consequence, the tension of the sacro- sciatic ligaments is increased. Symphysis Pubis.—This is an example of an amphi- arthrodial joint. In addition to the intervening disc of A.L. P.L. Fig. 142.—Horizontal section through the symphysis pubis. (After Luschka.) A.L.

Supra-pubic. 4. Infra- or sub-pubic. The anterior pubic ligament is strongly marked, and consists of two layers of fibres—a superficial and a deep. The superficial fibres are oblique, and cross each other like

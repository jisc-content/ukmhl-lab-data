FOREARM AND HAND. 145 Dorsal Aspect of the Wrist and Hand. Upon the dorsal aspect of the wrist and hand we have still to examine— 1. The radial artery and its branches. 2. The posterior annular ligament. 3. The extensor tendons of the fingers. Eadial Artery.—It is only a small portion of the radial artery that is seen in this dissection. At the lower end of the radius the vessel turns backwards below the styloid process, and upon the external lateral ligament of the radio- carpal joint. Having gained the dorsal aspect of the carpus, it runs downwards upon the scaphoid and trapezium, and finally disappears from view by turning forwards through the upper part of the first interosseous space, and between the heads of origin of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. In the palm it takes the chief share in the formation of the deep palmar arch. While the radial artery rests on the external lateral liga- ment, it is deeply placed, and is crossed by the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and the extensor primi inter- nodii pollicis. On the carpus it lies nearer the surface, and is crossed obliquely by the third extensor tendon of the thumb, viz., the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. It is accompanied by two vence comites and some fine filaments from the musculo-cutaneous nerve which twine around it. The branches which spring from the radial artery in this part of its course are of small size. They are-— 1. The posterior radial carpal. 2. The first dorsal interosseous. 3. The two arterioe dorsalcs pollicis. 4. The arteria dorsalis indicis. The posterior radicit' carpal artery takes origin on the outer aspect of the wrist, and runs inwards upon the carpus, to vol.. 1.—10

ABDOMEN. 3S8 ABDOMINAL WALL. On the fifth day after the dissection of the perineum is completed, the body is placed upon its back, with blocks under the chest and pelvis, and the dissectors of the abdo- men begin the dissection of the abdominal wall (Fig. 76). External Anatomy.—It is well, however, before proceed- ing to the actual dissection of the part, that some attention should be paid to the general configuration and bony prominences of the region. If the subject is obese the abdomen presents a smooth, rounded, and protuberant appearance ; if, on the other hand, it is spare, the abdominal wall is depressed, and the lower margin of the thorax above, and the pubes, crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament below, stand out in marked relief. In the middle line, the student will notice a linear depression extending downwards towards the symphysis. This corresponds with the linea alba or the interval between the two recti muscles. It is a most important line to the surgeon, because here the wall of the abdomen is very thin and devoid of blood vessels, and, in consequence, it is chosen as the site for the incisions in the operations of ovariotomy, Csesarean section, and suprapubic lithotomy. In the same line the trocar is introduced into the abdomen in the operation of para- centesis abdominis or tapping. In this linear depression, rather nearer the pubes than the ensiform cartilage, is the umbilicus or navel. This is a depressed and puckered cicatrix, the floor of which is raised in the form of a little button-like knob. It results from the closure of an opening in the abdominal wall of the foetus, through which passed the constituents of the umbilical cord —viz., the umbilical vein, the two umbilical arteries, and the urachus. In powerful well-developed subjects the rectus muscle stands out on each side of the middle line, and its outer

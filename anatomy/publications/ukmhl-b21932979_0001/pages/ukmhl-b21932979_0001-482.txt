458 ABDOMEN. an-inch above the subcostal plane, and about four and a-half inches below the lower end of the gladiolus. As the stomach becomes filled it changes its position. It becomes more oblique in its direction, and the pyloric opening moves to the right until it comes to lie in close relation to the neck of the gall-bladder. The cardiac open- ing is the only part which is more or less fixed in its position. It is placed opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra, and on the surface of the body its situation may be indicated by placing the finger on the seventh costal cartilage of the left side, about one inch from its junction with the sternum. The slight range of movement which is allowed to this part of the stomach is due to the manner in which it is fixed by the oesophagus to the diaphragm. (Esophagus.—The portion of the gullet which is placed within the abdomen is very short, and occupies a groove on the back aspect of the left lobe of the liver. By pulling this part of the liver aside the gullet will be seen joining the stomach. Relations between Thoracic and Abdominal Organs.—At this stage it is useful to consider the relations which exist between the abdorhinal and thoracic organs which lie upon the different aspects of the diaphragm. We have seen that the right lobe of the liver occupies the right vault of the diaphragm, whilst the left lobe of the liver, the fundus of the stomach and the spleen occupy the left vault. The base of the right lung is in relation to the right lobe of the liver. The pericardium, in by far the greater part of its extent, lies above the left lobe of the liver, which therefore intervenes between it and the stomach; only a limited portion of the apex of the heart extends over the region of the stomach. The base of the left lung lies over the left lobe of the liver, the fundus of the stomach and the spleen (Fig. 96). The Small Intestine is that part of the alimentary canal which succeeds the stomach. It begins in the epigastric

ABDOMINAL WALL. 395 The superficial circumflex iliac proceeds outwards and upwards along the line of Poupart's ligament, and ends in the skin in the neighbourhood of the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The superficial epigastric takes a vertical course upwards, and, crossing Poupart's ligament, ramifies in the superficial fascia over the lower part of the abdomen. Its branches extend as high as the level of the umbilicus. The small veins which accompany these arteries open into the internal saphenous vein. The Muscles of the Abdominal Wall.—The abdominal wall is formed anteriorly and laterally by five pairs of muscles, and by the aponeuroses which constitute their tendons. In front are the two recti muscles and the two pyramidales muscles. The recti are placed parallel to the middle line, and extend in a vertical direction from the pubic bones to the lower margin of the thorax. On each side three fleshy and aponeurotic strata are met with as we dissect from the surface towards the abdominal cavity. These strata are—(i) the external oblique muscle; (2) the internal oblique muscle; (3) the transversalis muscle. The direction taken by the muscular fibres which compose each of these layers is different. The external oblique corre- sponds in this respect with the external intercostal muscles ; the fibres proceed obliquely downwards and forwards. Again, the internal oblique resembles the internal intercostal muscles in the direction of its fibres; they are directed upwards and forwards, and thus the fibres of the two oblique muscles cross each other like the limbs of the letter X- Lastly, the fibres composing the transversalis muscle pursue a horizontal or transverse course. This difference of direction in the fibres which compose these three strata is a source of strength to the fleshy part of the abdominal wall, and offers an insurmountable barrier to the protrusion of any of the abdominal contents. The two oblique muscles and the transversalis are prolonged

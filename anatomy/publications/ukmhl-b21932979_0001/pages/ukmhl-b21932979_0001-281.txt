257 HIP-JOINT. thorough manner in which the head of the femur is received into it; (2) upon the tension and power of the ligaments ; (3) upon the length and oblique direction of the neck of the femur; and (4) upon atmo- spheric pressure. The Ligaments in connection with the hip-joint are :— 1. Capsular. 2. Ligamentum teres. 3. Cotyloid. 4. Transverse. The capsular ligament and the ligamentum teres are attached to both bones entering into the construction of the joint. The transverse and the cotyloid ligaments are connected with the acetabular cavity; the former partially fills up the notch or deficiency in its inferior part, whilst the latter surrounds its circumference in a ring-like fashion, and serves to still further deepen it. Capsular Ligament.—This is exceedingly strong, and surrounds the joint on all sides. Superiorly, it is attached around the acetabulum; above and behind, directly to the innominate bone, just outside the rim of the cavity; in front, to the outer aspect of the cotyloid ligament; and below, to the transverse ligament. Inferiorly, it clasps the neck of the femur. In front, it is attached to the whole length of the anterior intertrochanteric line, and to the root of the great trochanter. This attachment is very firm and strong. Behind and below, it falls short of the posterior intertrochanteric line by about half-an-inch, and it presents a weak attachment to the posterior and inferior surfaces of the neck of the femur. If the capsule of the hip-joint has been carefully cleaned it will be seen that the fibres which compose it run in two different directions. The majority pass in a longitudinal direction from one bone to the other; others, however, may be observed to take a more or less transverse or circular course. The latter are only seen to advantage on the posterior aspect of the capsule, whilst the longitudinal fibres are massed on the front of the joint. Certain thickened vol. [.—17

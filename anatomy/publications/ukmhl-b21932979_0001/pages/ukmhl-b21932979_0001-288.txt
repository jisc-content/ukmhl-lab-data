THE LOWER LIMB. 264 bony projections in these that the surgeon is enabled to determine the point at which to enter the knife when he is called upon to perform partial amputation of the foot. Examine the inner margin first. Begin behind at the pro- jection formed by the internal tuberosity of the os calcis, and proceed forwards. About one inch below the internal malleolus the inner edge of the sustentaculum tali may be recognised, and about one inch or a little more in front of this we recognise the tubercle of the scaphoid. Then comes the internal cuneiform bone, and this is succeeded by the first metatarsal bone. None of these bony points can be said to form distinct prominences on the surface of a well-developed foot. In order to distinguish them the inner margin of the foot must be judiciously manipulated by the fingers. On the outer margin of the foot the tubercle on the base of the fifth metatarsal bone stands out as a distinct landmark. Behind this is the cuboid, and still further back the outer surface of the os calcis, which is almost completely subcutaneous. When present in a well- developed form the peroneal tubercle on this surface may be distinguished about one inch below and a little in front of the external malleolus. If the foot be strongly inverted the anterior end of the os calcis will be seen to project on the surface. Subdivision of the Leg into Regions.—In the dissection of the leg four distinct regions may be recognised, viz. :— 1. An anterior tibio-fibular region, in which are placed those structures which lie in front of the interosseous membrane, and between the two bones of the leg. 2. A tibial region, corresponding to the subcutaneous or inner surface of the shaft of the tibia. 3. A peroneal region, which includes the parts in relation to the outer surface of the fibula. 4. A posterior tibio-fibnlar region, in which are placed the parts on the back of the leg which lie behind the interosseous membrane and the two bones of the leg.

It is a matter for regret, however, that students so very generally neglect the opportunities which are afforded them during their dissections of gaining a practical know- ledge of the general architecture of the different organs which come under their notice. The connecting link between the dissecting room and the histological labor- atory is thereby lost. The spleen offers us a good example ; it is only when we deal with such an organ as a whole, and not with thin slices suited for the microscope, that we can obtain a proper appreciation of its framework, and the general disposition of its constituent parts. For the last three years a Committee appointed by the Anatomical Society of Germany, and comprising as members representatives from all the more important nationalities, has been engaged in the difficult task of endeavouring to obtain some uniformity in anatomical nomenclature. The final agreement as to the terms to be applied to the bones, muscles, and blood vessels have recently been published. Where these differ from those in common use in this country, the author has, in most cases, intro- duced into the text, within parentheses, the names recom- mended by the Committee. The chapter on the Organ of Hearing was written by Dr. H. St. John Brooks. The great attention which he has devoted to its proper demonstration in the dissecting

The anterior concavity is the more extensive of the two, and is adapted for the greater part of its extent to the posterior aspect of the cardiac part of the stomach. In its lower part it is also related to the tail of the pancreas, and to a variable extent to the splenic flexure of the colon. The posterior concavity is a narrow surface which is fitted Fig. 95.â€”(A.) Internal surface of the spleen. (Drawn from the model by His.) (B.)

The peritoneal connections of the spleen are such that this renal depression cannot be studied unless the posterior border of the organ is pulled forwards, so that we can see behind it. Passing from the fundus of the stomach to the inner sur- face of the spleen, in front of the renal depression, is the

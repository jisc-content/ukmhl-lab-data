169 THE LOWER LIMB. Interphalangeal Joints.—The ligaments connecting the phalanges are arranged upon a plan identical with that already described in connection with the metacarpophalan- geal joints. This should not be made an excuse however to slur them over. Movements.—The nature of the articular surfaces only admits of flexion and extension. Flexion of the second phalanges of the fingers is brought about by the flexor sublimis, and of the ungual phalanges by the flexor profundus. Extension of the phalanges at the interphalangeal joints is largely produced by the interosseous and lumbrical muscles acting through the extensor tendons, into which they are inserted. These muscles, therefore, whilst they flex the first phalanx at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, extend the second and ungual phalanges at the interphalangeal joints. In the case of the thumb, the long flexor and the extensor secundi internodii pollicis operate at the interphalangeal joint. THE LOWER LIMB. On the morning of the third day, after the subject has been brought into the Rooms, it is placed upon the table with its face downwards and its chest and pelvis supported with blocks (Fig. 1, p. 3). In this position it is allowed to remain for four days, and during this time the dissector of the lower limb has a very extensive dissection to perform. He has to dissect—(1) the gluteal region; (2) the popliteal space; and (3) the back of the thigh. With so much work before him, and being limited as to the time in which it must be done, it is very necessary that he should apportion the four days at his disposal so as to be ready for the turning of the body. The first two days he should devote exclusively to the study of the gluteal region ; the third day may be given

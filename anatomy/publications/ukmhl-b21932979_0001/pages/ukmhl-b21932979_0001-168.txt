144 THE UPPER LIMB. secundi internodii pollicis, it leaves the posterior interosseous artery, dips under cover of that muscle, and joins the anterior interosseous artery on the posterior aspect of the interosseous membrane. It will afterwards be traced to the back of the carpus, where it ends, under cover of the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum, in a gangli- form enlargement. The branches which spring from the posterior interosseous nerve in the forearm are given entirely to muscles. Before it pierces the supinator brevis it gives branches both to it and to the extensor carpi radialis brevior. After it appears on the back of the forearm it supplies the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor minimi digiti, the extensor carpi ulnaris, the three extensors of the thumb, and the extensor indicis. It therefore supplies all the muscles on the outer and back aspects of the forearm, with the exception of the supinator radii longus and the extensor carpi radialis longior, which derive their nerve-supply directly from the musculo-spiral. The anconeus also derives its main nerve of supply from the musculo-spiral, but it also fre- quently obtains a second twig from the posterior interosseous nerve. Terminal Branch of the Anterior Interosseous Artery.â€” The terminal or perforating branch of the anterior inter- osseous artery is a vessel of some size. It appears through the interosseous membrane, about two inches or so above the lower end of the forearm. Accompanied by the pos- terior interosseous nerve, it runs downwards, under cover of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and ends on the back of the carpus by anastomosing with the posterior carpal arch and the posterior interosseous artery.

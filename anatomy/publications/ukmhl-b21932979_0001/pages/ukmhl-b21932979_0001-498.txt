ABDOMEN. 47o arranged in two pouches.—a large pouch in front and a smaller pouch situated behind it. The large pouch is the one into which we have opened in opening the cavity of the abdomen. Now it must be clearly understood that these are simply compartments of one serous sac, and that they com- municate freely with each other through a narrow channel called the Foramen of Winslow. The best way to find the foramen of Winslow is to lay hold of the fundus of the gall- bladder with the left hand, and then pass the forefinger of the right hand backwards along it towards its neck. The finger will slip behind the gastro-hepatic omentum into the foramen. The foramen of Winslow has the following boundaries :— in front, the right free margin of the gastro-hepatic omentum, between the two layers of which are the hepatic artery, the portal vein, the hepatic duct, and some nerves; behind, the vena cava, and the right crus of the diaphragm, covered by the layer of the trans-verse meso-colon, which passes upwards on the posterior wall of the abdomen ; below, the duodenum and hepatic artery; and above, the lobulus caudatus of the liver. The lesser bag of the peritoneum extends downwards into the omentum, upwards to the posterior surface of the Spigelian lobe of the liver and back part of the diaphragm, and to the left as far as the spleen. It is closed in the following manner :—in front, by the two anterior layers of the great omentum, by the stomach, by the gastro-hepatic omentum, and the lobulus Spigelii of the liver; behind, by the two posterior layers of the great omentum, by the trans- verse colon, by the transverse meso-colon, and by the layer which ascends on the posterior wall of the abdomen over the pancreas, left kidney, left suprarenal capsule, and dia- phragm : on the left side, by the spleen and gastro-splenic omentum. In a favourable subject these points can be made out by dividing the two anterior layers of the great omentum along the greater curvature of

THE LOWER LIMB. 3°4 along the line of the external intermuscular septum; (4) twigs to the outer margin of the foot which anastomose with the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis. The Internal Plantar Nerve is the larger of the two terminal branches of the posterior tibial, and it takes origin in the hollow of the os calcis under cover of the internal annular ligament. It accompanies the internal plantar artery, and presents the same relations. After it emerges from under cover of the abductor hallucis, it gives off the digital branch to the inner side of the hallux, and then ends in the interval between the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum by dividing into three digital branches. The branches of the internal plantar nerve are :— 1. Cutaneous twigs to the skin of the sole. 2. Muscular branches. 3. Four digital branches. The cutaneous twigs to the integument of the sole spring from the trunk of the nerve, and pierce the deep fascia in the line of the internal intermuscular septum. The four digital branches supply both sides of the hallux and of the second and third toes, and also the tibial side of the fourth toe. The first or innermost digital nerve goes to the inner side of the great toe. The seco?id divides to supply the contiguous margins of the great toe and the second toe. The third deals similarly with the second and third toes; whilst the fourth supplies the adjacent sides of the third and the fourth toes. In its digital distribution, therefore, the internal plantar nerve closely resembles the median nerve in the hand. To the fourth or outermost digital branch a twig of communication is given by the superficial division of the external plantar nerve. The digital nerves should be traced along the toes. They are arranged in a manner very similar to that of the corre- sponding nerves of the fingers. The muscular branches go to four muscles of the sole,

4o THE UPPER LIMB. in the intermuscular interval between the pectoralis major and the deltoid. To both of these muscles it gives twigs. The Long Thoracic Artery (a. thoracica lateralis) takes the lower border of the pectoralis minor as its guide, and proceeds downwards and inwards to the side of the chest. It gives branches to the pectoral muscles, the serratus magnus, and the mammary gland, and anastomoses with twigs from the intercostal arteries. It gives off, as a rule, an external mammary branch, which winds round or pierces the lower border of the pectoralis major to reach the mammary gland.1 The Alar Thoracic supplies the fat and lymphatic glands in the axilla, and rarely arises as a separate branch from the axillary artery. Its place is usually taken by twigs from the subscapular and long thoracic arteries. Subscapular Artery.—This is the largest branch of the axillary artery, and it arises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis muscle. Following this, it runs down- wards and backwards, in company with the long sub- scapular nerve, to the inferior angle of the scapula, where its terminal twigs anastomose with the posterior scapular artery. Not far from its origin the subscapular artery gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapula (a. circumflexa scapulae) which winds round the axillary border of the scapula, in close contact with the bone, to reach its dorsal aspect. Numerous smaller twigs are given to the neigh- bouring muscles, viz., the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus magnus. Circumflex Arteries.—These are two in number, and as a rule they both arise from the axillary at the same level, a short distance below the origin of the subscapular artery. The posterior circumflex (a. circumflexa humeri posterior) is much the larger of the two. Only a small portion of it can 1 This branch may arise separately from the axillary artery. Some authors apply the term external mammary to the long thoracic artery.

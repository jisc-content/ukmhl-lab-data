The lowest subscapular nerve must now be looked for upon the surface of the subscapularis muscle. Axillary Artery.—It is the third part of the axillary artery which is now exposed, and the vein will be seen to lie upon its inner side, and also partly in front of it. It is important to note the position of the large nerves, with reference to the artery, before they are much disturbed by the dissection. E.C. P.C.

The nerve of Wrisberg (ike lesser internal cutaneous nerve) is also internal to the artery, but is separated from it by the axillary vein, to which it is closely applied. The internal cutaneous nerve, and the inner head of the median, lie in front of the artery; the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves are directly behind it ; while the median and musculo-cutaneous nerves are placed upon its outer side. The latter nerve vol. 1.—3

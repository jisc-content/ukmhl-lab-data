In the child the suspensory muscle is well marked and easily isolated, but in the adult it loses its distinctly muscular character, and becomes more or less blended with neigh- bouring tissues. Pancreas.â€”The pancreas is an elongated gland which stretches transversely across the posterior wall of the abdo- men behind the stomach. For the most part it is situated in the epigastric region, a small portion only of its left extremity being placed in the left hypochondriac region. It is usually described as consisting of a head, a body, and a tail. The head of the pancreas is its right extremity, greatly enlarged and bent downwards upon the body like the head of a hammer. It fits accurately into the concavity of the duodenum, and is moulded upon the vertebral column, in front of the first and second lumbar vertebra. Inter- vening between it and the spine are the crura of the diaphragm, the aorta, the inferior vena cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the commencement of the vena portse ; whilst running downwards on its posterior aspect, in close relation to the second part of the duodenum, is the common bile-duct. The superior mesenteric vessels, as they proceed downwards, emerge from under cover of the lower border of the pancreas, and the lower end of its head is folded to the left behind them, so as to enclose both the artery and the vein more or less completely in a deep groove or canal in the gland substance. In front, the head of the pancreas is covered by the layer of peritoneum which forms the posterior wall of the lesser sac, and is in relation to the pyloric portion of the stomach, whilst the upper end of this portion of the gland juts upwards beyond the pyloric portion of the lesser curvature of the stomach, in the form of a smooth rounded prominence, which lies behind the gastro-hepatic omentum,

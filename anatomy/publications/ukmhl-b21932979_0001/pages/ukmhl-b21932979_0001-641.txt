PEL VIS. 609 this structure. It is the widest and at the same time the most dilatable part of the canal, and further, it is fusiform, being wider in the middle than at either its commencement or termination. In connection with the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, there are certain very important features to be noted. The mucous membrane along the mesial plane is raised into a prominent ridge called the verumontanum} This commences a short distance in front of the uvula vesicae, and extends forwards for about three-quarters of an inch. Posteriorly, it rises to a considerable height, but anteriorly, it gradually fades away. On each side of the verumontanum, the floor of the urethra is hollowed out into a longitudinal depression, termed the prostatic sinus, into which numerous prostatic duds open. This may be rendered evident by squeezing the prostate, when fluid will be observed to exude into the two sinuses. These ducts belong to the lateral lobes of the prostate. A close inspec- tion of the floor of the urethra behind the verumontanum, will reveal the apertures of the ducts of the middle lobe of the prostate. Immediately in front of the highest part of the veru- montanum, the mucous membrane dips backwards and upwards behind the middle lobe of the prostate, and between the lateral lobes, so as to form a small recess or cul-de-sac. This is the sinus pocularis or the utriculus. Gauge its extent by means of a probe. It will be observed to be from a quarter to half-an-inch long, and to be very narrow at its orifice, but to widen out considerably towards its blind extremity. It is of interest, both from a develop- mental and a surgical point of view. It is the representative, in the male, of the uterus and vagina in the female. Practi- 1 Other terms are applied to this mesial ridge on the floor of the urethra—viz., crest of the urethra, colliculus scmiitalis, and caput gallinagiuis. VOL. I.—39

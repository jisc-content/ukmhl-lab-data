The body is now turned round so as to lie on its back. The pelvis is supported by two blocks, and the lower limbs are stretched out at full length upon the table (Fig. 4, p. 18). Surface Anatomy.â€”The anterior superior spine of the ilium should in the first place be recognised, and the crest of the ilium traced as it proceeds outwards and backwards from this. The boundary line between the front of the thigh and the region of the abdomen is formed by Poupart's ligament, which stretches from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis. Its course and position are marked on the surface by a faint groove. By running the finger along this when the thigh is fully extended the ligament may be felt. At its inner end the spine of the pubis should be determined, and then the finger may be carried inwards on the crest of the pubis to the symphysis pubis. The rami of the pubis and ischium, leading downwards and backwards to the tuberosity of the ischium, constitute the upper boundary of the thigh on its internal aspect, and their relation to the surface must there- fore be ascertained. Below Poupart's ligament in the extended position of the thigh, there is a faint depression corresponding in position to Scarpa's triangle. In the dissection of the front of the thigh, the skin is also reflected from the anterior aspect of the knee. The dissector should therefore take the present opportunity of studying the surface anatomy of this articulation. The patella forms a marked prominence in front of the joint. When the limb is extended and the extensor muscles on the front of the thigh are relaxed, the patella will be found

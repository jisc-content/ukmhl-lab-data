ABDOMEN. 568 arch, and in this situation it is generally known as the superior or deep layer of the triangular ligament. This con- sists of two lateral halves, each of which on reaching the urethra sweeps backwards around the anterior border of the levator ani, and joins the visceral layer (Fig. 128). Inferiorly, it is attached to the base of the triangular liga- ment, which, as we have seen, is on the same morphological plane as the bone; consequently this attachment is quite in keeping with the attachment of the fascia further back, bladder parietal pelvic fascia — obturator internus ... prostate „ sinus pocularis levator ani — ramus of pubis .. compressor urethras — triangular ligament — crus penis-- erector penis •■ superficial perineal „. vessels and nerves the fascia of Colles capsule of prostate. anal fascia. parietal pelvic fascia. ihyroid membrane. /'superior layer of -! triangular ligament ^ {i.e., par.pelv.fasc.) pudic vessels and nerves. .. crus penis. ejaculator urinae clothing the bulb.

Visceral Layer of Pelvic Fascia.—In the greater part of its extent the visceral pelvic fascia springs from the inner surface of the parietal pelvic fascia, along the white line. In front, however, it has an attachment to the back of the body of the pubic bone above the attachment of the parietal layer. It is from the portion of bone between these layers

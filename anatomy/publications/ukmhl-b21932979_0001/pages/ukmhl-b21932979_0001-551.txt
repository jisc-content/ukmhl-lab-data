The posterior impression, the impressio renalis, is moulded upon a variable extent of the anterior surface of the right kidney. It is much deeper than the colic impres- sion, and it looks more backwards than downwards. When the hollow viscera in the vicinity are empty, and the abdominal wall is in consequence retracted, this hollow becomes so deep that the kidney might almost be said to be sunk into the liver substance. The small internal impres- sion, the impressio duodena/is, lies immediately to the inner Fir,. 112.â€”Posterior surface of the liver. (Drawn from the model of His, slightly modified.) V.C.

The Posterior Surface of the Liver may now be studied (Fig. 112). It is moulded upon the front of the vertebral column, from which it is separated by the diaphragm. It presents, therefore, a deep hollow corresponding to the bodies of the vertebrae. Immediately to the left of the fissure of the ductus venosus there is a smooth notch or groove which

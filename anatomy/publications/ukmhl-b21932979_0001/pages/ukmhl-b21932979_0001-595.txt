PEL VIS. 563 great and small sacro-sciatic foramina and the structures which emerge from and enter the pelvis through these apertures. The section of the bone may now be made. This simply consists in taking away that portion of the innominate bone which bears the acetabulum. The first step is to saw through the spine of the ischium, close to its base. The bone must then be sawn through above and below the acetabulum—(1) the first cut should extend from the upper gluteal vessels and nerve pyriformis greats \ i?*ssm sciatic J- r.- nerve-' spine of ischium pudic vessels and nerve, and nerve to obtu- rator internus small sciatic nerve sciatic artery great sacro-sciatic '*' ligament external """/"" cutaneous nerve.

The direction in which the saw is to be carried in making these sections is indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 125. In the case of the first section, the direction will be somewhat influenced by the depth of the acetabulum. In no case, however, is it wise to

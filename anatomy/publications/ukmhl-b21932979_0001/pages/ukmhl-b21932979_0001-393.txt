369 MALE PERINEUM. tuberosity, and is accompanied by two veins and the two divisions of the pudic nerve. Of the latter the dorsal nerve of the penis lies above it and the perineal nerve below it. Reaching the base of the urethral triangle, the pudic artery insinuates itself between the two layers of the triangular ligament, and, gradually emerging from under cover of the bone, proceeds forwards along the edge of the pubic arch to a point about half-an-inch below the symphysis, where it pierces the superficial layer of the triangular ligament, and immediately ends by dividing into two branches under cover of the cms penis—viz. (1.) the artery to the corpus caver- nosum, and (2.) the dorsal artery of the penis (Fig. 72, P- 372). Branches of the Pudic Artery.—The pudic has already been seen to give off the inferior hemorrhoidal, the superficial perineal, and the transverse peri?ieal arteries, and to divide into its two terminal branches—the dorsal artery of the penis and the artery to the corpus cavernosnm. Between the layers of the triangular ligament it gives origin to the artery to the bulb. The artery to the bulb is a short wide vessel which springs from the pudic about a quarter of an inch above the level of the base of the triangular ligament. It passes tranversely inwards between the two layers of this ligament, and, giving a small twig to Cowper's gland, it enters the substance of the bulb. It supplies the bulb and corpus spongiosum with blood. The artery to the corpus cavernosum pierces the inner aspect of the crus penis, and is carried forward in the sub- stance of the corpus cavernosum, which it supplies with blood. The dorsal artery of the penis runs forward in the interval between the crura penis, and, passing between the two layers of the suspensory ligament, gains the dorsum of the penis, where it will be afterwards traced. The Pudic Nerve.—The pudic nerve is a branch of the sacral plexus. Following the internal pudic artery it enters vol. 1.—24

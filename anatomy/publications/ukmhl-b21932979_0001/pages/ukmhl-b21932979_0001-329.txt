SOLE OF THE FOOT. viz., the abductor hallucis, the flexor brevis digitorum, the flexor brevis hallucis, and the innermost or first lumbrical muscle. The branches which supply the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum arise from the trunk of the internal plantar nerve a short distance from its origin. The other two spring from the inner two digital nerves : thus, from the first digital nerve proceeds the branch to the flexor brevis hallucis; from the second, the branch to the first lumbrical. The External Plantar Nerve corresponds to the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand. It accompanies the external plantar artery and presents the same relations. In the interval between the abductor minimi digiti and the flexor brevis digitorum, opposite the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, it divides into a deep and a superficial part. The deep division follows the plantar arch under cover of the flexor tendons. The superficial division divides into two digital branches. From the trunk of the external plantar nerve proceed hvo muscular branches, viz., to the musculus accessorius and to the abductor minimi digiti. The first or outer digital branch of the superficial part of the external plantar nerve goes to the outer side of the little toe. It also gives muscular twigs to the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the interosseous muscles in the fourth intermeta- tarsal space. The second digital branch divides to supply the adjacent sides of the fourth toe and little toe. It likewise sends a twig of communication to the fourth digital branch of the internal plantar nerve. Dissection.—The abductor minimi digiti should be completely de- tached from its origin, and turned forwards in order that a good display may be obtained of the structures composing the second stratum of the sole. Second Layer of Muscles and Tendons.—As the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis enters the sole it grooves the vol. i.—20

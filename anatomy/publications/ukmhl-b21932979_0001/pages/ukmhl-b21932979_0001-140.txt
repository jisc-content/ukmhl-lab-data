THE UPPER LIMB. n6 Dissection.—The palmaris brevis should be reflected by detaching its fasciculi from their origin, and turning them inwards. In raising the muscle care must be taken of the ulnar artery and nerve, which lie under cover of it, and a little nerve-filament from the latter should be traced into its substance. The granular fat should next be removed from the palm, and the dense palmar fascia cleaned. Towards the roots of the fingers the digital vessels and nerves, together with the lumbrical muscles, appear in the intervals between the slips into which the palmar fascia divides. These should be defined, and it will be seen that they pass downwards under cover of the superficial transverse liga- ment. Having noted this point, remove the ligament. The digital arteries and nerves for the inner side of the little finger, and the outer side of the index, appear beyond the area of the central part of the deep fascia, higher up than the others, and are consequently liable to injury, unless it be remembered that they occupy this position. Palmar Fascia.—The deep fascia of the palm is com- posed of three portions—a central and two lateral. The lateral parts are thin and weak, and are spread over the muscles which constitute the thenar and hypothenar eminences on the outer and inner margins of the palm. The centralportio?i of the palmar fascia, on the other hand, is exceedingly strong and dense, and is spread out over the middle of the palm. It counteracts the effect of pressure in this region, and effectually protects the ves- sels, nerves and tendons, over which it is stretched. Its strength differs considerably in different hands, and it is seen to be'st advantage in the horny hand of a labourer, or of a mechanic who has been in the habit of handling heavy implements.

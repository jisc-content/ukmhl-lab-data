THE UPPER LIMB. 146 join the corresponding carpal branch of the ulnar artery. The arch thus formed is placed under cover of the extensor tendons, and gives off two branches which run down- wards in the third and fourth intermetacarpal intervals. They are termed the second and third dorsal interosseous arteries. The first dorsal interosseous artery arises, as a rule, from the radial trunk, although not infrequently it may be seen to spring from the posterior carpal arch. It extends down- wards in the second intermetacarpal interval. The three dorsal interosseous arteries are brought into connection with the arteries in the palm by communicating branches. They are joined by the three perforating twigs of the deep palmar arch. These make their appearance on the dorsum between the heads of the three inner dorsal interosseous muscles. Further, at the lower ends of the interosseous spaces the dorsal interosseous arteries usually send inferior perforating branches to join the corresponding digital arteries in the palm. The two dorsal arteries of the thumb run downwards upon either side of that digit. The dorsal artery of the index is distributed on the radial side of the index. Posterior Annular Ligament.â€”This has been seen to be an aponeurotic band which stretches obliquely across the wrist. It is merely a thickened portion of the deep fascia, and its attachments are so arranged that it does not interfere with the free movement of the radius and hand during pro- nation and supination. On the outer side it is fixed to the outer margin of the lower end of the radius, whilst on the inner side it is attached to the cuneiform and pisiform bones, and also to the palmar fascia. In the case of the anterior annular ligament one large compartment, or tunnel, is formed for the flexor tendons; not so in the case of the posterior annular ligament. Partitions or processes proceed from its deep surface, and these are attached to the ridges on the

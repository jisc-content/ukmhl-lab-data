SOLE OF THE FOOT. 3ii Dissection.—The adductor obliquus hallucis and the flexor brevis hallucis must now be detached from their origins and thrown forwards, in order that the entire length of the plantar arterial arch, and the deep division of the external plantar nerve, may be displayed. In raising the adductor hallucis the branch which is given to it by the deep division of the external plantar nerve must be secured and retained. The Plantar Arterial Arch is the continuation of the external plantar artery. It extends across the sole from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone to the posterior part of the first intermetatarsal interval, where it is joined by the dorsalis pedis artery. The plantar arch is deeply placed, it rests upon the interosseous muscles close to the bases of the metatarsal bones, and it is covered by the flexor tendons, the lumbrical muscles, and the adductor obliquus hallucis. It is accompanied by the deep division of the external plantar nerve and by two vena comites. The branches which proceed from the plantar arch are:— 1. Articular. 2. Posterior perforating. 3. Digital. The articular tivigs arise from the concavity of the arch, and run backwards to supply the tarsal joints. The posterior perforating branches are three in number. They proceed upwards in the back parts of the outer three intermetatarsal spaces. Each artery occupies the interval between the heads of the corresponding dorsal interosseous muscle. They end on the dorsum of the foot by joining the three dorsal interosseous branches of the metatarsal artery. The digital branches are four in number, and are arranged in the same manner as the digital branches of the super- ficial palmar arch in the hand. The first or outermost goes to the fibular side of the little toe; the second proceeds for- wards in the fourth interosseous space, and divides to supply the contiguous sides of the fourth and little toes; the third bifurcates at the cleft between the third and fourth

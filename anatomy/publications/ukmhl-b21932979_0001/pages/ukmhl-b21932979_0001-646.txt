614 ABDOMEN. and, at the same time, endeavour to make out the composi- tion of their walls. This can best be done under water. In addition to the recto-vesical fascia which ensheathes them, each vesicula has a strong dense fibrous tunic and a certain proportion of transverse and longitudinal non-striated mus- cular fibres. Open them up and expose the mucous lifting. This is remarkable for its honeycomb or reticular appear- ance. In this respect, therefore, it is not unlike the mucous membrane of the gall-bladder, only the meshes are finer and the pits smaller. Pelvic Articulations. The pelvis is attached to the last lumbar vertebra, and its several parts are held together by the following articu- lations :—(i.) Lumbo - sacral; (2.) Sacro - coccygeal; (3.) Coccygeal; (4.) Sacro-iliac; (5.) Pubic. Dissection.—The nerves and blood vessels of the pelvis must now be removed, and all adhering portions of muscle detached from the left innominate bone and the front and back of the sacrum. When this is done, the pelvis should be soaked for some time in warm water. By this proceeding the dissection of the ligaments will be rendered much easier. Lumbo-sacral Articulations.—The last lumbar vertebra is joined to the sacrum by one amphiarthrodial joint, which connects the body of the vertebra to the base of the sacrum, and by two diarthrodial joints, between the two pairs of articular processes. Capsular ligaments surround the articulations formed by the apposition of the articular processes, and each is lined by a synovial membrane. The anterior co??imon ligament of the vertebral column is continued downwards over the anterior aspect of the body of the last lumbar vertebra to the anterior aspect of the first segment of the sacrum. In a similar manner the posterior

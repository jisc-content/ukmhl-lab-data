POPLITEAL SPACE. 199 popliteal space. In its upper part it is separated from the femur by some fatty tissue; then it crosses the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and lastly it comes into contact with the fascia covering the popli- teus muscle. The popliteal vein is placed upon a more superficial plane, and crosses the artery. In the upper part of the space it is placed upon the outer side of the artery, whereas in the lower part it is situated upon its inner side. The two vessels, however, are in close association throughout, and are bound to- gether by a dense fibrous sheath. The internalpopli- teal nerve is super- ficial to both vessels, and crosses the artery from without inwards; in the upper part a short distance to the outer side the lower part it lies on the inner popliteal V. popliteal A. tendon of adductor magnus. superior internal articular artery, superior external articular artery. inferior external articular artery. inferior internal articular artery.

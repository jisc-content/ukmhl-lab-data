ABDOMEN. 502 or ileum. It is ten to twelve inches in length, and extends from the pylorus of the stomach to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. Here it bends forwards on itself in the form of the duodeno-jejunal flexure and becomes continuous with the jejunum (Fig. 108). The duodenum is adapted to the front of the vertebral column, and describes a curve like a horse-shoe, the convexity of which is directed to the right, whilst the concavity looks to the left and embraces the head of the pancreas. For convenience in description it is divided into a first part, a second part, and a third part. The first part of the duodenum is two inches in length, and is contained in the epigastric region. It is enveloped by the same two layers of peritoneum which invest the stomach, and consequently enjoys a limited degree of movement. Its position and relations are dependent upon the degree of distension of the stomach. When that viscus is empty, and the pylorus, in consequence, occupies the mesial plane, the first part of the duodenum passes backwards and to the right, with a slight inclina- tion upwards, until it reaches the neck of the gall-bladder. Here it ends by bending suddenly downwards into the second part. Under these circumstances the first part of the duodenum lies in close apposition with the lobulus quadratus of the liver. When the stomach, on the other hand, is distended, the pylorus comes into relation with the lobulus quadratus, and the first part of the duodenum is pushed to the right, and occupies a depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, behind and to the right of the transverse fissure. The relations of the first part of the duodenum are as follows : above, the under surface of the liver; below, the head of the pancreas; behind, the common bile-duct, the gastro-duodenal artery, and the portal vein. The second part of the duodenum takes a downward course from the under surface of the liver, and is usually about

SOLE OF THE FOOT. 297 (a) external malleolar; (l>) anterior peroneal; (c) posterior peroneal; and (d) tarsal. On the inner aspect of the joint the internal malleolar branch of the anterior tibial anastomoses with small twigs from the internal calcanean branch of the posterior tibial. SOLE OF THE FOOT. In this dissection the dissector will meet with the follow- ing structures:— 1. Superficial fascia and cutaneous vessels and nerves. 2. Deep plantar fascia. C Abductor hallucis. 3. Superficial muscles, -J Flexor brevis digitorum. I Abductor minimi digiti. 4. External and internal plantar vessels. 5. External and internal plantar nerves. 6. Tendons of flexor longus hallucis and flexor longus digitorum. 7. Musculus accessorius and lumbrical muscles. 8. Flexor brevis hallucis, adductor obliquus hallucis, and adductor transversus hallucis. 9. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. 10. Plantar arterial arch. 11. Arteria magna hallucis. 12. Tendons of peroneus longus and tibialis posticus. 13. Interosseous muscles. Reflection of Skin.—The limb should be placed upon the table, with the sole of the foot facing the dissector, and the ankle supported by a good-sized block. Two incisions are required—(1) a longitudinal incision along the middle line of the sole, from the heel to the root of the middle toe ; (2) a transverse cut, at the digital extremity of the mesial incision, across the sole at the roots of the toes. The skin should also be reflected from the plantar surface of each of the toes. This can be done by means of a longitudinal incision along its middle line. Superficial Fascia.—When the flaps of skin which are mapped out by the above incisions are reflected, the peculiar characters of the thick layer of superficial fascia become apparent. It is tough and granular, and in some respects

"5 FOREARM AND HAND. Superficial Structures.—The superficial fascia over the central part of the palm is dense and thin. The fat is subdivided into small lobules by fibrous septa which bind the skin to the subjacent palmar fascia. Towards the ulnar and radial margins of the hand the fat becomes softer, and the amount of fibrous tissue in its midst diminishes. In connection with the superficial fascia of the palm we have to study—(1) the palmaris brevis; (2) the super- ficial transverse ligament; and (3) the palmar cutaneous nerves. The palmaris brevis is a small cutaneous muscle em- bedded in the superficial fascia which covers the upper part of the hypothenar eminence. If it has not already been exposed by the reflection of the skin, carry the knife transversely through the granular fat on the ulnar margin of the palm immediately below the anterior annular ligament. The fleshy bundles of the muscle will come into view. When these have been cleaned, the muscle will be seen to consist of a series of distinct fasciculi, which in its lower part are frequently separated from each other by intervals of varying width. It constitutes a thin fleshy layer, which covers an inch and a-half or more of the hypothenar eminence. Externally it takes origin from the anterior annular ligament and inner border of the central part of the palmar fascia, whilst internally its fasciculi are inserted into the skin over the ulnar margin of the hand. The palmar cutatieous nerves are three in number, and they arise, as already noted, from the ulnar, median and radial nerves. They should now be traced to their ultimate distribution in the palm of the hand. The transverse superficial ligament is a band of fibres which extends across the palm at the roots of the fingers. It is intimately connected with the skin, and is enclosed within the folds of integument in the clefts between the lingers.

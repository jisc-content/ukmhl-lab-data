THE LEG. 279 Anterior Annular Ligament.—The dissector should again examine this ligament, and the arrangement of the structures which pass under it. The upper portion is at- tached to the fibula by its outer end, and to the tibia by its inner extremity. By dividing its fibular attachment, and throwing it inwards, it will be seen to give a separate and distinct sheath to the tibialis anticus. The loiver portion is the more important of the two. Its attachments have already been noted (p. 268). Examine closely the manner in which it holds the tendons in their tibialis posticus flexor longus digitorum posterior tibial vessels and nerve.

It consists of two layers, and these, by separating at certain points and becoming re-united at others, form th ree distinct compartments. Through the innermost passes the tendon of the tibialis anticus; through the middle one passes the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis; and through the outermost are transmitted the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius. On opening up these sheaths each will be seen to be lined by a synovial membrane. Lastly, note the position of the anterior tibial vessels and nerve as they

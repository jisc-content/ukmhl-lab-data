THE LOWER LIMB. 208 to be freely moveable when grasped firmly between the finger and thumb. Note its change of position when the leg is flexed on the thigh at the knee-joint. It passes downwards, and lies in front of the interval between the femur and tibia. The patellar surface of the femur can now be felt. The powerful ligamentum patellae which passes vertically downwards from the patella to the anterior tuberosity of the tibia can be easily distinguished. The massive condyles of the femur should next be studied and compared. The internal condyle is much the more pro- minent of the two, and immediately above its tuberosity the adductor tubercle can be recognised. The articular interval between the condyles of the femur and the head of the tibia is not visible on the surface, but it can readily be felt by the finger. The three tuberosities of the tibia should likewise be studied, and the position of the head of the fibula on the posterior and lower aspect of the external tuberosity ascertained.

59§ ABDOMEN. plexus resolves itself, there are various other twigs given off from it—viz., 1. Superior gluteal. 2. Inferior gluteal. 3. Small sciatic. 4. Nerve to the obturator internus and superior gemellus. 5. Nerve to the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus. 6. Branches to the pyriformis muscle. 7. Branches to the pelvic viscera. The superior gluteal nerve arises on the posterior aspect of the plexus by three roots from the lumbo-sacral cord and the first and second sacral nerves. It leaves the pelvis with the gluteal vessels through the upper part of the great sacro- sciatic foramen, and in the gluteal region is distributed to the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae femoris muscles. The inferior gluteal nerve is the special branch of supply to the gluteus maximus. It arises upon the posterior aspect of the plexus, from the first and second sacral nerves, and gains the gluteal region through the lower part of the great sciatic foramen below the level of the pyriformis muscle. The small sciatic nerve is often closely associated at its origin with the preceding branch. It arises on the posterior aspect of the plexus by two or more roots from the second and third sacral nerves, and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The nerve to the obturator internus springs from the anterior aspect of the sacral plexus. It accompanies the pudic nerve through the great sacro-sciatic foramen into the gluteal region, where it gives a twig to the superior gemellus. It reaches the obturator internus by passing through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, and ends by sinking into the inner aspect of this muscle. The nerve to the quadratics femoris arises from the anterior aspect of the plexus, and enters the gluteal region by passing through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen.

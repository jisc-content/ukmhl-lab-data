We are very far from having any positive in- formation respecting the state of absorption dur- ing infancy ; but if we judge by that of the lym- phatic glands, it would appear it must be most energetic : in fact, these glands are comparatively very much developed, they contain the focus of very active functions ; their degree of vitality at that age is more striking than will be found after- wards : hence a greater pre-disposition to disease. We are well aware that, until the age of puberty, or rather till growth is completed, these organs are the focus of numerous affections which entirely subside after that stage of life, and are to be deduced from the extensive series of those to which we are disposed. The following circumstances; 1st. The early, and proportionally the more considerable, deve- lopement of the lymphatic glands in the infant. Sdly. Their pre-disposition to diseases strongly characterized, most certainly denote a considera- ble degree of activity in their functions, because it implies a remarkable increase of the vital powers, and these being greater, must unavoida- bly preside over very energetic functions. In fact, if we only consider the organs whose functions have been ascertained, and which in infancy are, on the one hand considerably developed, on the

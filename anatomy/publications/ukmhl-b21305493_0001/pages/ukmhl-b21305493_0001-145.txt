CELLXJLAK SYSTEM. 3 them entirely. The former peculiarity of the struc- ture exists when these organs have one side free and the other adherent, as the skin for instance; the second, which is more general, is found when it is connected universally with the adjacent parts. Let us separately consider these two cases. The Cellular System, connecting the Organs only on one side. There are three membraneous organs, which are free on one side, and are clothed with cellular tissue on the other : these organs are the skin, the serous and mucous membranes. We may likewise mention that which lines the outside of arteries, veins, absorbents, excretories, which have none internally. As this tissue has also a place in the formation of these vessels, most authors examine it in treating of this subject. I judge it preferable to enter into a general consideration of the different parts of the cellular membrane. Subcutaneous Cellular Tissue. Besides the chorion, which is abundantly fur- nished, as we shall see, with cellular tissue, and which anatomists suppose is formed by a peculiar condensation of this tissue, the skin universally exhibits, wherever you examine it, a subjacent cellular layer, the quantity and density of which varies in different parts of the body. Along the median line, this tissue seems closer and more strictly adherent to the skin than in many other parts. This is easily ascertained by

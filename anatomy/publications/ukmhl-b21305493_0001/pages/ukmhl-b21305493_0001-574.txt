432 VASCULAR SYSTEM and the pulmonary artery in its proper membrane has a striking analogy with that of the other arteries, the veins now claim our attention; but we shall first take a general view of the common membrane, which is extended through the whole system of the dark blood. ARTICLE I. Situation, Form, Division, General Disposition of the Vascular System of the Black Blood. We shall now consider the veins in the same manner as we have examined the arteries, in their origin, their course, and termination, with this distinction only, that we shall follow them in- versely, in order to accommodate the ideas we are about to form of them, to the course of the blood that circulates in their cavities.

Here I shall only remark, that these vessels never arise from any organ into which

693 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. have denominated passive; they are so certain and copious upon the serous surfaces, that if a puncture were made the peritoneum would often be filled again with such excessive rapidity, that the fluid collected in a single day would require a month and more to be exhaled in the natural way. I do not pretend to say, that, in such cases, the absorbents are not also affected ; but the principal cause of dropsical complaints in such cases rests with the exhalants. I might produce other instances, but this will suffice. About four years ago, T had directed my attention towards the ab- sorbents ; it then struck me that these vessels, not- withstanding what several authors had asserted, were not always very apparent in dropsical sub- jects, and that they often admitted of an easier investigation in a very lean subject. This dis- tinction in dropsical cases had not then occurred to me; but on re-considering this system for the book I intend to publish on descriptive anatomy, I certainly shall attend to it, and compare the cases of its dilatation, and those of an opposite nature, with the cause of death. SECTION III. Termination of the Absorbents. All the absorbents that have been discovered, proceed to form two principal trunks. The first,

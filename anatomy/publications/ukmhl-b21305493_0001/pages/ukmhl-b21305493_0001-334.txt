NERVOUS SYSTEM 192 should sometimes be extended to an inch in dia- meter. Why do we not feel pain when an insen- sible part, adjoining next to the nerve, and even fixed to it, is irritated, whilst it is very acute in a part labouring under inflammation, although this may be at a great distance from the nervous cord ? The nerves in that case would also possess a sphere of activity in respect to motion. But why is not the contiguity of the nerves sufficient to produce it in the muscles ? Why is this the case in respect to sensation ? Animal Contractilityâ€”Influence of the Nerves on that of other Farts. The texture of nerves is completely deprived of this kind of contractility. In these no kind of sensible motion has been observed. I hey take, however, an essential partin this property, consi- dered in respect to the muscles of animal life. We shall see that thev are the essential agents that convey the principle of motion ; so that ani- mal contractility always supposes three actions successively performed ; namely, that of the brain, that of the nerves, and that of the muscles; Physiologists are of very different opinions re- specting the manner in which the influence of the nerves is propagated. Some have admitted a kind of vibration ; others a fluid which runs through the insensible canals of these organs. This last

Who is not aware that, between the dropsy of the tunica vaginalis and the encysted dropsy of the spermatic cord, there is the utmost analogy ; that the cura- tive means are the same, that the events are simi- lar, that in both cases the inflammation created by the injection of a foreign fluid, of wine for in- stance, is the same, and effects a cure by a similar mechanism ? If we open two subjects, each af- flicted with one of these diseases, and compare the state of the two bags in which the fluid had ga- thered, their aspect will be perfectly the same. Deprive the cyst in the melliceris of the fluid it contained, and but little difference will be ob- served between the hydropical cysts and serous membranes. The preceding considerations naturally lead us to establish a perfect similitude between cysts and serous membranes, the properties of which they partake, and into whose system they enter essen- tially, as well as into the cellular system. It is highly probable there exists a consent between the one and the other, and that when a cyst un- folds and supplies a more abundant exhalation, that of the serous membranes is diminished : how- ever this is not supported by direct proofs. Here an important question naturally presents itself,

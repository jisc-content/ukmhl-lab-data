409 OF THE RED BLOOD. blood ceasing totally to flow through the foramen ovrale, the ductus arteriosus, the umbilical arteries and vein; the latter on the formation of the red blood. This will be immediately considered. At the moment the foetus is born, it meets in all that surrounds it with causes of strong excite- ment. Its cutaneous surface, and all the organs of the mucous surfaces, are powerfully stimulated. The sensations they experience are even painful, because there is a great difference between the liquor amnii and the bodies with which the foetus comes in contact at the moment of the birth, and every abrupt transition in sensations is always at- tended with pain. Habit will soon destroy this ; but it is not the less real at birth, and it may be said in this respect, that the moment of birth is as painful to the infant as to the parent. Now as every lively sensation is always attended with great motions, a general agitation succeeds to the impression the foetus experiences after delivery. Every muscle, including the intercostals and the diaphragm, are all called into action. The air which already filled the mouth and the trachea, rushes through the lungs, imparts to the blood a reddish hue, is afterwards - alternately received and expelled until death. The first inspiration is then, in this first point of view, a phenomenon analogous to every motion which the change of external excitement suddenly produces at the event of birth in the voluntary muscles of the foetus.

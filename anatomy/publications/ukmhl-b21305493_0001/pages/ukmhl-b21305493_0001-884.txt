Both absorptions, the nutritive and the external, are then completely reversed in the two opposite stages of life : in infancy, the latter predominates over the former, in decrepitude it is quite the reverse. t In respect to external absorptions, such as those of the synovia, of the serous surfaces, of the cellu- lar tissue, &c., I am led to believe they predomi- nate in the aged subject, and that to this must be attributed several infiltrations and effusions that occur at that age, and which we observe in the dead body. Besides, we have not in this respect such substantial proofs as we possess in regard to the two others. section v. Accidental Absorption. Two things might be understood by this ex- pression : 1st. The absorption of fluids distinct from those naturally taken up by the absorbents, such as extravasated blood, &c.; I have already men- tioned this kind of absorption.

NERVOUS SYSTEM 198 nerves. The interior substance of the brain is scarcely ever inflamed. On the other hand, ex- amine the serous surfaces of the cellular mem- brane, where there is only a very minute portion of nerve ; on every occasion the capillary circu- lation is increased, and inflammation ensues. In the limbs of paralytic subjects, in animals, when you have divided a nerve to cause insensibility in a part, is not the capillary circulation carried on as actively as before, where nervous action has ceased ? Have we ever accelerated this circula- tion in a limb?- Have we ever produced inflam- mation in that part by convulsively increasing, through irritation, the nervous action of the limb ? Convulsive phenomena, and those of pal- sies, are perfectly distinct; they bear no analogy with those of inflammations, which, however, would unavoidably be the case if they were in- fluenced by the cerebral nerves. In the pheno- mena first mentioned it is animal sensibility that is injured ; in the others it is organic. This then is evidently independent of the cerebral nerves. 2dly. Exhalation is the second function over which this last property presides. I refer to the system of the Dermis, to ascertain that perspiration is independent of the nerves. Here I shall merely observe, that in the synovial membrane, where a very striking exhalation is carried on, there are scarcely any nerves; that the serous membranes and the cellular membranes, so very remarkable

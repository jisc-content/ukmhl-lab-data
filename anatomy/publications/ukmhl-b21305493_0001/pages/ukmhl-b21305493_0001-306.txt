However, I believe that their action is more effectual when this is in the raw state, than when it has been boiled, because in general all dissolvents act more effectually on that substance in the first of these cases. We know, that with the greatest part of carnivorous animals, the brain is a delicate morsel. Those that feed upon birds in which the skull is easily divided, devour the brain in the first instance.

209 OF ANIMAL LIFE. when worms in the stomach produce convulsions in children. In other instances, sensible organic contractility, which being increased in the heart by certain spasmodic pains of the stomach, brings on fever, frequently insensible organic contracti- lity and organic sensibility, as when the gastric affections are sympathetically increased, secretions take place upon the tongue, and cover it with a mucous fur. There are then such things existing as sympathies in animal sensibility and animal contractility, in organic sensibility and organic contractility. This being granted, let us examine the causes of each. 1st, When animal sensibility has been sympa- thetically increased in a part, it does not always proceed from the nervous communications, for the organs in which the material cause of pain exists, as the tendons, cartilages, &c. are not pro- vided with nerves; then it cannot communicate through them with those parts in which this pain is felt. On the other hand, we have noticed be- fore, that it is still very uncertain that the nerves are the sole agents which convey the internal sensations to the brain : then it would be incor- rect to say, that the afflicted organ first acts upon it through their means, and then re-acts on the part to which the sensation is referred, through those which are distributed there. Can it ever be admitted that the cellular membrane could become a proper agent for conveying pain, when that very texture is itself denied sensibility ? It

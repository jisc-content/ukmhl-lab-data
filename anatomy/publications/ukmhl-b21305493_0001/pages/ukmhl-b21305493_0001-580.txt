VASCULAR SYSTEM 438 equal in two different subjects, let their unifor- mity in respect to stature, age, &c. be what it may. If a living animal be selected for this purpose, besides the great difficulty it would be attended with, still no uniform result in this respect would be obtained, because the diame- ter of the veins varies in consequence of their being more or less filled. If we observe these ves- sels in subjects in which they may be perceived through the transparency of the integuments, they are sometimes more apparent than at others. Their volume is alternately doubled or rendered scarcely perceptible. There can be no doubt, that after copious drinking, when the dark blood has received a considerable supply of fluid, the vessels are more dilated than they are in the reverse state. Veins are remarkably contracted in subjects that have died of hunger. I have frequently observed the same phenomenon in cases of dropsies, con- sumptions, declines, &c. In general, whenever the mass of blood has been lessened, the veins are reduced by the contractility of texture. Arteries, on account of their firmness and tightness of tis- sue, are less subject than the veins to these varia- tions, but still they afford frequent instances of it. Let us then throw aside all calculation in re- spect to the proportions of capacity in organized canals. Whatever is permanent and invariable only can be admitted; but whatever varies at every instant can only be an object of general

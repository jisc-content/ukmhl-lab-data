343 OF THE RHD BLOOD. 0 uish the dilatations of arteries from those of every other system. Had they only compared the tex- ture of the arteries with that of the other sys- tems, they would have discovered the reason of this difference. From what has been previously stated, we may easily conceive why there is never any fat in the arterial texture; why in dropsical cases it is ne- ver infiltrated; why again no hydatids or cysts are found in its laminae ; why the various tumors which, as we have seen, are seated in the cellular texture, never interfere with arteries, &c. When- ever an artery has been wounded, either in the longitudinal or transverse direction, no granula- tions are seen to arise on the borders of the divided part; none, I believe, have been noticed by sur- geons in the operation of aneurism. In the fre- quent opportunities I have had in animal subjects of cutting arteries, and then leaving them free after having intercepted the course of the blood, 1 have never observed any thing similar. If an arterial trunk has been laid bare, the cellular tunic frequently furnishes granulations, but they have never been observed when the precaution of removing this tunic has been properly at- tended to.

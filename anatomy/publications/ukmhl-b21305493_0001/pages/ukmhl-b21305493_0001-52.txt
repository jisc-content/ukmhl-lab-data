GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Xll state of health, the motions which take place in di- gestion, and those in the circulation of the large vessels, at least in the venous and arterial circula- tions, excretions of urine, &c. In the state of disease all the phenomena of vomiting, diarrhoea, and the infinite changes of pulse, are ultimately referable to disordered states of sensible organic contractility. 3rdly. From animal sensibility all external sen- sations, as sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and all internal sensations, as thirst, hunger, &c. are derived in a state of health. In diseases, what a powerful part is filled by this property ! Pain and its innumerable modifications, such as irrita- tion of the skin, throbbing, pulsations, a sense of weight, prickings, dragging weariness, &c. all these are evidences of a change in animal sensi- bility. A hundred words would not suffice to ex- press the diversity of painful sensations that are excited by disease. 4thly. Animal contractility is the principle of voluntary motion, and the voice. Convulsions, spasms, palsies, &c. &c. arise from a perverted state of this property. If we examine all the phenomena of physiology and pathology, we shall not find an individual one among them that is not attributable to one , of the properties I have described. The indisputable truth of this assertion leads to an inference not less certain with regard to the treatment of diseases, namely, that all curative

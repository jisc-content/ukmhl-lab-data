561 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS* serum found in the peritoneum, the pleura, &c., whether it is that these two fluids are exactly mixed together, or that pus is suspended in flakes with the serum. Now this active exhalation of serum or pus, which appears in this case to be coagulated albumine, this exhalation then is evi- dently preceded by a considerable accumulation of blood in the capillary system ; an accumulation that has produced inflammation, and without which the exhalation could not have been per- formed : if, on the contrary, the increased serous exhalation, proceeding from weakness affecting the organization of the serous membranes, be exa- mined, we shall never find that blood has existed there in a larger quantity to produce the fluid. If the membranous pouches be opened subsequent to the diseases of the heart, to those of the womb, of the lungs, of the liver, of the spleen, &c., they are found filled with water, and still more trans- . parent than in their natural state, because they have received a less quantity of blood. 3dly. What I have stated respecting serous exhalations, ought also to be referred to the cel- lular ; some are active, such as those of pus and of serum that sometimes accompany the former: others are passive, as in leucophlegmacy after organic affections. Now in this case, as in the the preceding, accumulation of blood in the ca- pillary system attends the former, reduction in the quantity of that fluid characterizes the lat-

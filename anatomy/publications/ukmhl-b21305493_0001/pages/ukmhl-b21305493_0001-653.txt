OF THE DARK BLOOD. 511 <fee. are the general attributes of the veins in both circulations. There are., undoubtedly, ge- neral modifications depending upon situation. Thus, on account of the short extent of the pul- monary veins, their fluid is but very slightly in- fluenced by gravity; they are never subject to varices; the motion of the fluid is rather more rapid in their tubes, since they have merely to propel it to the capillary system of the lungs, &c. Thus has the pulmonary artery, the branches of which are less curved, afforded me less strik- ing pulsations than those of the aorta, &c.; but the general phenomena are always the same: these are only different modifications. This explains why the general disposition is nearly the same in veins and in arteries, whether they are intended for the circulation of the red or that of the dark blood. Thus, for in- stance, the two arteries project each from a ven- tricle through a single opening, indispensable for the unity of the impulse communicated to the blood, to the uniformity of its course in the divi- sions of the large vessels, and to the simultaneous pulsation in every division. Veins, on the contrary, supply the heart with the two species of blood by â€˜several distinct openings, which is quite immate- rial, since, as we have seen its motion in the veins is not uniform, but liable to be accelerated or re- tarded in any part, according to the impression received. Thus it may pass with rapidity into

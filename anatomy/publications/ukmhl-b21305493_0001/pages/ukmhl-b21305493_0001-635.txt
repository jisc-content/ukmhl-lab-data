OF THE DARK BLOOD. 493 Remarks on the Motion of the Dark Blood in the Veins. From what we have just stated, and will be afterwards included in treating of the capillary system, it follows that when the blood has entered the vein, it is evidently no longer influenced by the heart. It is then certain that pulsation cannot exist in these vessels. In fact, 1st. This pheno- menon proceeds from the sudden impulse conse- quent upon the contraction of the left ventricle ; the blood being poured from every part into the veins through the capillary system, this impulse is necessarily wanting, and the exciting cause of pul- sation does not therefore affect the veins. 2dly. Veins also do not possess either elasticity or re- sistance, indispensable faculties for its production in the tissue of the vessel in which that motion exists. They are not then susceptible either of the beating which causes the reflux of blood when the lungs are affected, the irregular motions of the heart, nor of the peculiar motion and undula- tion which take place when the arterial blood is made to circulate through their tubes ; but in either of these cases the heart is constantly the principle of motion, which, without this organ, could not exist. This is the manner in which motion takes place in the veins. The capillary

OF THE DARK BLOOD. 471 of these partly impeding its course, it loses by de- grees the motion it has received from the heart. The existence of valves is generally constant, but they vary considerably, both in number and situation; sometimes very near, at others times very distant. They display in this respect num- berless varieties. In the small trunks they are generally less distant from each other ; in the large trunks they are more sparingly distributed. They are seldom disposed three by three, more frequently in pairs, and sometimes insulated, which is particularly the case with small vessels; in those, for instance, of the hand, the foot, &c. Besides, in Hallerâ€™s book, very long descriptions, regard- ing the general disposition, the form and position of the vascular folds, we are now considering, will be found. These folds enact, as we shall see, a very im- portant part in the veinous circulations. It is the existence of these that, in a great part of our operations, supersede the necessity of tying the veinous trunks. In fact, were it not for the valves, the blood poured by the collaterals into the open vessel, might easily pass in a retrograde direction, and the effusion of that contained in the whole course of the vessel would be dangerous, whilst the only hemorrhage that can take place is that of the fluid contained between the incision and the first or second valve. Valves render veins essentially distinct from

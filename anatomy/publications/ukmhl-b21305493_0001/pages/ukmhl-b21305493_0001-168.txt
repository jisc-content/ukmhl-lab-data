CELLULAR SYSTEM. 26 Cellular Tissue of the Cranium, The contents of the cranium are but scantily supplied with this tissue, which is scarcely any where apparent. If, however, we raise the arachnoid membrane in those parts where the vessels dip into the substance of the brain, and those also where the nerves arise, we shall detect a small quantity of it, remarkable for its excessive fine- ness and transparency. The pia-mater is chiefly composed of this tissue, which appears to be continuous wTith that of the brain. It is very difficult notwithstanding to demonstrate this fact, although we macerate the brain ; indeed it is only visible in fungous tumours, and then, by no means clearly ascertained. The communications of the cellular tissue within the cranium are very numerous. 1st. Anteriorly, the membrane passes into the orbit by the foramen opticum and the fissura sphe- noidalis : from thence the redness and suffusion of the eye in cases of phrenitis, whose influence is propagated by means of such communications, as well as by the continuity of the membranes. It enters the nostrils by the foraminula cribrosa, &c., which explains the sense of weight and head-ache which is experienced in coryza, &c. Sndly. Inferiorly, the numerous foramina in the basis of the scull connect the cellular tissue of

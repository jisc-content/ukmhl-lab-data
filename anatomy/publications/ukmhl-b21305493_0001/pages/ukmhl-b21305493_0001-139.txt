GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XC1X organs are developed in this mucous substance, it is still visible for a certain time in their inter- stices, and presents the same aspect as the body of the embryo in the early stage of utero-gestation; it consolidates by degreesâ€”fills with cells and puts on the form of cellular membrane : from whence we may presume, that in this mucous state of the embryo the parenchyma of the nu- trition of organs exists only, and as this paren- chyma is the same in all, it is evident that the mass of the embryo must appear homogeneous in its nature. Nutrition commences when each in- dividual parenchyma appropriates to itself its peculiar substance, and all similitude of nature ceases. It is not difficult after these considera- tions, to perceive the uniformity of the nutritive parenchyma, as also its cellular, vascular, and, in some cases, nervous texture. I am well aware that this common parenchyma of nutrition which has been admitted, must itself be provided with the means of nutrition, and that consequently we must ascend still higher; but truth in physiology must be sought, and can be found only in secondary effects; in them we seek the lights of experience and of facts, and beyond them we meet only with the false illusions imagination. After having demonstrated that every organ is alike in respect to the common parenchyma of nutrition, it is needless to prove that they differ

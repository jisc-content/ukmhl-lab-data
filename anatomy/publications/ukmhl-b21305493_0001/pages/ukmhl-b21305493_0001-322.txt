180 NERVOUS SYSTEM in my experiments upon injections of black blood in the brain. At the moment the nerve is elevated and drawn to separate it from the carotid to which it is attached, the animal cries out, and is greatly agitated; but when this has been re- peated once or twice, he ceases to give signs of pain. If the nerve be not excited for an hour or two, sensibility is restored with a degree of energy when it is drawn again. These experiments produce a result analogous to those made on animal contractility in the muscles, and with which every physiologist is familiar. The animal sensibility of nerves has a peculiar character which distinguishes it from that of every other system. It is this very character which has impressed a distinctive one in respect to pain proceeding from the organs, which in no way resembles that seated in the skin, and in the mucous surfaces, &c. What has par- ticularly drawn my attention, in respect to the diversities of the pain of which each system is the seat, is the questions put by a man of very good parts and great presence of mind, whose thigh had been amputated by Desault, and who asked me, after the limb had been removed, why the painful sensation he experienced after the in- cision of the skin, was so different from that he felt when the fleshy parts were divided, in which the nerves, distributed in every direction, were affected by the knife ; and why this sensation,

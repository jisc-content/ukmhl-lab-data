Thus the spleen and the hollow organs, instead of dis- playing, as the serous surfaces, a vascular plexus, through which the blood is moved in different directions, according to the impulse received, merely present a spongy lamellated tissue, the na- ture of which we are not yet perfectly acquainted with, and in which the blood seems to stagnate in- stead of being circulated, &c. SECTION VIII. Circulation in the Capillary Vessels. There are two circumstances connected with the circulation of this system; 1st. The motion of fluids ; 2dlv. The changes they undergo. Motion of the Fluids in the Capillary System. These fluids consist of; 1st. The blood; 2dly. Other fluids differing from this in their composi- tion, although we can form distinctions from their appearance only. Let us examine the laws that regulate the motion of each. When the blood has entered the capillary sys- tem, this fluid is evidently no longer under the influence of the heart, and is circulated only by

OF ORGANIC LIFE. 271 of that of the cerebral nerves, whose filaments are merely in opposition with these vessels. The adhesion here is so very strong, that they may almost be considered as forming one body, and this naturally bespeaks a use in respect to circu- ' lation and other organic functions with which we are not yet acquainted. As these vessels dis- tribute every where the materials indispensable to these functions, of secretions, of exhalations, of nutrition, &c., organic nerves must, undoubtedly, have some influence over them. Neither expe- rience nor observation have hitherto discovered any thing on this point. Veins are not so plentifully surrounded with the accompanying organic nerves. It is the same with the absorbent trunks, which proceed almost every where in an insulated state from this system. The constant union of arteries with the organic plexuses, an union which bespeaks quite an op- posite 'disposition from that of the ganglions, must undoubtedly influence the action of the plexuses, or rather, that of the nerves proceed- ing from them, by the motion they receive from the blood. It is to be remarked in this respect, that in the same manner as nature has provided the basis of the brain with innumerable arteries to agitate it by an alternate motion, she has also placed the most considerable plexus of the whole organic system on such parts where the

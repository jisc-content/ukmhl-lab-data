VASCULAK SYSTEM 44 6 the brain, amongst the circumvolutions; in the muscles, amongst the fasciculi, &c. On issuing from the organs the ramifications of the veins plunge into the branches, which assume, as we have observed, two positions, the one sub-cutaneous, the other deep. The sub-cutaneous branches ramify in the limbs, between the apo- neurosis and the skin; in the trunk, between this and the abundant cellular layer, that incloses the muscles. The deep-seated branches are situate in the interstices of the organs, and attend the arteries in almost every part. The cerebral branches have a particular dis- tribution ; they are situate in the interstices of the dura-mater, and in common with these inter- stices, they form what is called the sinuses. The branches of the veins differ from those of the arteries, in being infinitely less flexible: this is remarkable both under the skin and in the interstices of the organs. This would prevent locomotion, admitting that an impulsive agent existed at the origin of the veins, and that their parieties were not of so lax a nature. It therefore follows, that a continuation of arterial tubes is actually more extensive than a corresponding continuation of veinous tubes; this facilitates the motion of the dark blood, which has less distance to overrun, and would find in the flexures causes of obstruction, which in respect to the red

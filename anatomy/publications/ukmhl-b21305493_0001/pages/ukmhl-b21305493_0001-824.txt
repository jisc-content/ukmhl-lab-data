ABSORBANT ^SYSTEM. 682 number of glands, which they cross in succes- sion. Forms of the Absorbents in tlieir Course. The absorbents differ essentially from the veins, in preserving the same volume for a consi- derable distance, whilst the latter progressively unite into larger trunks, and a branch scarcely extends a few inches before its volume is double ; but that of the absorbent remains the same. When injected, these vessels at a distance appear like white threads curling over the organs. From this it follows, 1st. That the lymph never circulates like the blood in considerable columns, but always in very minute streams. 2dly. That the absorbents are very much mul- tiplied ; their number compensating for the size : thus it is that every surface is crowded with them, whilst the veins, united into trunks, are more sparingly distributed. 3dly. That the absorbant system is not disposed in an arborescent form, like the arterial and vein- ous systems ; the mode of division is completely different. The absorbents are very often straight; whenever this is not the case, their curvatures are quite different from those of the arteries and veins. In fact, when these become as small as the absorbents, their frequent curvatures are in

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 632 is gorged and infiltrated, whilst on examining a serous surface, similarly affected, the blood is found contained in the capillary tubes. It is indeed a great error to consider that in- flammation is the same in every part presenting both the fluids, and their vessels, as constantly in the same state. Boerhaave, for instance, thought inflammation could not exist without the error loci, as it was termed. There are, according to the state of the parts, their structure, and vital powers, innumerable modifications in the new anatomical order which this affection imparts to the organs. What constitutes the essence of inflammation is, 1st. Irritation of the inflamed part. 2dly. The changes in the vital powers from this irritation. 3dly. The consequent stagnation of humours round the irritated parts. But in whatever manner these humours are fixed, whether they have ceased to circulate in the capillary system, or that their motion has been checked by the exhalants; or again, that they have been extravasated in the adjacent tubes, &c., they are as many different effects depending upon the different organization of the parts ; but the principle is always the same,it is invariably the same disease. If we could analyse accurately the state of every system in a state of inflammation, we might perhaps find that in each it is different.

VASCULAR SYSTEM 390 several judicious authors, particularly by Haller, Spallanzani, Weitbreck, Lamure, Jadelot, &c. or with new facts. I have just presented the rudi- ments of this work. We have seen how much the firm and elastic structure of the arterial texture is accommo- dated to the locomotions of arteries, and how the flexures of these vessels influence them, I shall add, that the loose adherence they contract with the adjoining parts, and that their con- stant position in the cellular texture, contribute essentially to this motion. If the red blood circulated in the veins, instead of pulsation, a kind of vibration would be left under the finger, as in varicous aneurism. There would be no motion, if the arterial parieties were formed of the dermoid, mucous, or serous mem- branes, &c.: the impulse would be productive of different phenomena. There are then two circumstances relating to the pulse. 1st. Impulsion of the blood, a sudden and general motion in the mass, by the contrac- tion of the heart. 2ndly. Locomotion of the ar- teries, an effect produced by this fluid on the arterial parieties that transmit it. The first is the most essential; in respect to the second, it would vary if the arterial texture that occasions it ceased to be the same: it depends upon this tex- ture, and is not essential to circulation. When an artery is removed from the extremity

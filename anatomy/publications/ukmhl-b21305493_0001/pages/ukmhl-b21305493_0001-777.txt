CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 635 circulation; but the blood might circulate through this system independent of this excitement, as my experiments, already stated, have proved. section in. Alteration of the Blood in the Capillary Vessels o f the Lungs. The very reverse of what exists in respect to the general capillary vessels takes place in these. We in reality know very little respecting the causes of this phenomenon, but it is my opinion that new experiments should be made before any explanation be attempted. This is of so much more importance, that if we were perfectly con- scious how the dark blood is converted* into red, a 7 we should soon find the reason why the red is also changed in colour. In my book on life and death, I have presented the phenomena relating to this process; it would be superfluous to repeat them here. Nu- merous particulars respecting the circulation in both capillary systems, which I shall also avoid repeating, will be found in the same work. 3 b 2

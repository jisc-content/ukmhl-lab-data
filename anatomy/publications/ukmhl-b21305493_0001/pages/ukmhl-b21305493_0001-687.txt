CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 545 they form a continuation to the arteries, and in the liver they give rise to the veins; I shall pass them over unnoticed in these present considera- tions, and regard only the general and pulmonary systems. These two capillary systems, especially the former, still claim our more particular attention, because ; 1st. The circulation is actuated in this system by laws quite different from those which in the other parts preside over that motion ; 2dly. Because the greatest number of the important functions of organic life, such as secretions, nu- trition, exhalations, &c. take place in it; 3dly. Because their minute canals are, in numerous cases, affected with diseases, and the focus of the various inflammations, metastasis, &c.; 4thly. That animal heat is especially produced in these capillary tubes, &c. The lower classes in the animal creation posi- tively possess nothing more than a capillary cir- culation ; their fluids are never united in consi- derable masses in canals that convey them to all the parts, and subsequently return them from these parts. There is merely an imperceptible oscillation, as it were, of these fluids, in very nu- merous and minute tubes. This mode of circula- tion is one of the links, or rather transitions, be- tween the animal and vegetable, which, deprived of a perceptible circulation, as the zoophy tes, evi- dently possess nothing more than insensible and

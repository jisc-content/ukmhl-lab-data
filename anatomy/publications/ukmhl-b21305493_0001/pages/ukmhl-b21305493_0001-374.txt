NERVOUS SYSTEM 232 cera predominate, an affection of these organs, &c. Thus it is that the very same passions that would cause jaundice or obstructions of the liver, &c. in the adult, in the infant would produce epilepsy, which attacks the brain. Not only the nervous functions are frequently disturbed by sympathies in the infant, but it is particularly at that age that organic diseases are more frequently met with in the brain, spinal marrow, the nerves, or in the organs that depend upon them. The cerebral fungous, hydrocephalus, spina bifida, &c. are a manifest proof of this. The large quantity of blood which is then conveyed to the nervous system has a great influence on this phenomena; and this remarkable quantity itself is solicited by the predominance of the vi- tal forces.

At the age of puberty, the empire of the brain, which has been insensibly effaced, gives place to that of the genital organs, which display a sud-

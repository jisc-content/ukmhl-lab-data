743 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 2dly. That which takes place in cysts that are formed against the natural order of the economy. Now this displays, by comparing it with acci- dental exhalation, rather a singular phenomenon : in fact it is performed but with difficulty. We rarely see the fluids of encysted tumours suddenly returned either wholly or in part to the circulating mass, which is not uncommonly the case with the serous collections of the peritoneum, which with- out cure are often alternately filled and emptied. Is there a physician that has not in such cases remarked the urine to flow in proportion as the ab- domen is depressed, or that fluid suppressed wThen it fills again ? Let us observe on the contrary, that exhalation is renewed with the utmost facility in encysted tumors; that if they are emptied, and their removal has not been attended to, they will soon, as I have stated, return again. Whether the ab- sorbents developed in these tumours are in pro- portion to the exhalants I cannot tell; but the fact is nevertheless correct; diseases prove it daily. END OF THE FIRST PART.

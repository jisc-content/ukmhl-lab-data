lxxiv GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. We have, I think, reached an epoch in which morbid anatomy is about to receive a new and unexpected impulse. This science does not only embrace that of organic derangement, produced by the slow and progressive deteriorations of chronic disease, whether they be causes or effects, but likewise a minute and careful examination of all such changes that the subordinate parts of the animal economy may experience, at whatever stage of disease it may be conducted. With the exception of certain kinds of fevers and nervous affections, every thing in pathology is in the reach and grasp of this science. How idle and insig- nificant do we find the opinions of physicians, and many too of high endowments and great repute, when we examine them not in their books, but in the dead body. The practice of physic has been long excluded from the circle of the exact sciences; but if the study of the dead body and its morbid appearances be combined with a constant, cautious, and rigorous observation of the living body in a state of disease, it will have a clear and undisputed title to be admitted among them, and especially in virtue of its diagnosis. This is the direct and undeviating line that rea- sonable minds now incline to pursue, and it will, I doubt not, be generally pursued. What may observation avail us if we know not the seat of the evil? We may make clinical notes from sun- rise to sunset for twenty years, on diseases of the

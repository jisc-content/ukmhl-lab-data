188 NERVOUS SYSTEM were to lose their action, the general feeling of touch would also be lost. It is the same with the organs of sensation. I believe then that nerves are actually neces- sary to exterior sensations, whatever may be their nature. Xiet it be remarked, that all the organs with which the external parts may be in contact, as the dermoidal system, all the organs of the mucous system, and those of the senses, are more or less provided with cerebral nerves. JVone of these receive nerves from the ganglions. This exterior part of the nervous system in ani- mal life is very considerable; added to that part, which proceeds to the voluntary muscles, it will constitute nearly the whole of the system, which has but very few connections with the organs of % O internal life. In respect to internal sensations, their pheno- mena are not so striking as in the former cases. That the brain is the central point of these sen- sations, as those which are external cannot be called in question; in fact, if by the influence of wine, opium, or by any other means the office of that organ be suspended, and acute pains affect the interior organs, they never can be felt. Thus in concussion of the brain, although the impressions of sound, light, and of smells, are conveyed as usual to the ear, eye, and nostrils, that remain uninjured, we are not sensible of them. But how are the impressions received by the interior or-

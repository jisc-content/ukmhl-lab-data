CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 603 addition, or by a subtraction of principles. Is it loaded with hydrogen and carbon ? or does it only divest itself of oxygen in the organs ? Are these two causes united to produce this change of colour from red into black ? I believe it will hardly ever be possible to resolve these questions that do not appear to me to admit of being sub- mitted to any positive experiment. However, as the arterial blood supplies all the organs with the materials for secretion, nutrition, and exhalation, it is to be presumed it deposits rather than bor- rows from these organs the principle of colour. Sometimes the red blood flows through the capillary system without losing its colour; for instance, when dark blood has for some time con- tinued to flow from a vein, the current sometimes becomes red, or nearly so. I have myself twice ascertained this fact, which I believe has been in- dicated by some authors. The blood acquires, in the general capillary system, more or less of a deeper colour. If the flow of blood has been at all regarded, the varie- ties of colour in the stream flowing from the vein must undoubtedly have been observed in diseases. Does this fluid flow from each part of the capillary system with different shades of co- lour ? It never appeared to me that there is any material difference in this respect. I have had frequent opportunities of opening the veins of the kidneys, the saphena), jugular veins, &c., and the z z 2

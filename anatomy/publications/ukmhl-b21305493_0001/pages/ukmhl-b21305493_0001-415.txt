OF ORGANIC LIFE. 273 and by irritating them comparatively with the lombar nerves, I have in every instance been led to this remark. We are well aware that in cases of sarcoceles, the immediate ligature of the sper- matic artery is hardly attended with pain, al- though it is covered by branches proceeding from ganglions, with a plexus in the form of a net, and which cannot possibly be removed. If we draw out a part of the intestines through a small aperture made in the abdomen, the irritation of the sub-mucous layer on the side of the vessels is hardly felt, although that part is amply sup- plied with the nerves proceeding from the gan- glions. I have had innumerable opportunities of acting in different ways upon the carotid artery, the upper part of which is supplied with branches from the superior cervical ganglion: but as long as I did not interfere with the par-vagum, the animal remained perfectly calm. I am far from being convinced, however, that the nerves of ganglions are absolutely devoid of sensibility; but undoubtedly under similar circumstances to those I have just mentioned, the cerebral nerves would have produced much greater pain in the animal. I am induced to believe, that in the morbid state this sensibility is considerably increased. It cannot be denied, that the solar plexus takes an active part in the. different sensations we ex- perience in the epigastric region. It is probable,

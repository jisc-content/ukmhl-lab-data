OF THE KEL> BLOOD. 427 tions began to weaken, then it contracted by a kind of general quivering of its fibres. In pro- portion then, as the contractions of the heart became weaker, the pulse continued to sink: as soon as the tremulous motion invaded its fibres, the beating of the artery was converted into that peculiar undulation, which indicates that every kind of motion will soon cease. I shall observe, in the system of the muscles of organic life, that the heart is possessed of several modes of contraction, the most remarkable are : 1st. That it is naturally endowed with, in which contraction and dilatation suddenly and regularly succeed each other. Sndly. That in which these two motions having remained in their natural state are irregularly connected. 3dly. Those in which the fibres only oscillate, by which the car- diac cavities not being sufficiently contracted, impart to the blood an undulatory motion, rather than a perfect shock, &c. Now, to every kind of motion of the heart, a peculiar kind of pulse corresponds, which is easily ascertained in living animals. I am surprised that authors who have argued so much upon the causes of this phenomenon have never thought of resorting to experiments to decide the question. There are, no doubt, nume- rous modifications of the pulse, which it would have been impossible for them to connect with mm2

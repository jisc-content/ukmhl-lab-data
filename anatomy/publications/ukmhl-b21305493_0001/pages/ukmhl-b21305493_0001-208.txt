CELLULAR SYSTEM. 66 only difference is, that they lie in closer contact with each other, and are distinct. From what I have stated above, it would ap- pear that the common cellular tissue is composed of two things, 1st. Of an infinitude of numberless thin transparent plates, occurring wherever the tissue is loose, susceptible of sudden distension from various causes, and readily retaining the fluids which are enclosed in its cells 5 2ndly. Fila- ments intermingled with those plates wherever they occur, but existing alone in other parts. These cellular plates and filaments have a pecu- liar tendency to absorb atmospheric moisture. This tendency is particularly obvious in dissecting- rooms, where a subject, that is perfectly dry and easily dissected in the morning, is often com- pletely infiltrated towards evening, if the weather has been humid. This infiltration then must have taken place in the cellular system, which in such cases may be considered as a true hygrometer. Composition of the Cellular Tissue. This tissue has been included by certain che- mists in the general class of white organs, or those that afford a large quantity of gelatine. In fact, it furnishes a certain proportion, and a remark- able precipitate may be obtained by means of a dissolution of tannin from water in which this

VASCULAR SYSTEM' 422 portionate increase of the organs to which they resort. Towards the fortieth year, the gastric viscera seem to acquire a more marked vitality; but this vitality does not influence the volume of the ar- teries that are distributed to them. Although the increase in height ceases about the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the increase in width still continues, so that the internal vis- cera continue to enlarge, and their arteries conse- quently expand till this mode of increase also terminates. I have constantly been struck with this phenomenon, on comparing the injected arte- ries in a subject of sixteen or twenty years old, with those of thirty-six or forty. In the latter, they are constantly much larger. This is the dis- tinction that suggested to me the first idea of dis- tinguishing the increase in the length, from that in the width of the body, because the'develope- ment of the arteries invariably implies a corre- sponding state of the organs. The period when the body ceases to increase in width is then very remarkableâ€”1st. For the want of increase in the calibre of the arteries. 2ndly. For the general equilibrium which takes place in their develope- ment. In proportion as arteries increase during the years succeeding to the growth of the whole body, their density and thickness is augmented, their fibres become more and more evident, their

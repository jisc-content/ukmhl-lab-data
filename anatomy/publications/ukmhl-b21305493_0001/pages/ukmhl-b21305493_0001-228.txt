86 CELLULAR SYSTEM. case I have just represented, is slowly and gradu- ally superinduced. In all acute diseases, we observe that the skin is exquisitely susceptible of the sympathetic in- fluence of disordered or diseased organs, and is alternately dry or moist at the same period, and often in the same day, I am clearly convinced that the cellular tissue undergoes the same changes ' as the skin, and if the eye could discern them, we should discover its cells at one time, more or less moist, at another, more or less dry, according to the peculiar mode of influence by which it is af- fected. To this we have, unquestionably, to refer the different state of subjects that have died of acute diseases, and present numberless varieties in the secretion of cellular serum. Physicians are disposed to consider most symptoms on too broad and general a scale, which are not, properly speaking, dependent (as they conceive) on the disease itself, but flow in various channels from the sympathetic influence of the diseased over the sound organs. The sound organs exhibit according to the manner in which they are affected, various phenomena, essentially foreign to the disease, which renders its features more or less complex, but do not constitute an essential part of it. They occur indefinitely, but in nowise do they influence the disease. We must remark that, the organic sensibility and contractility of this tissue, are almost invari-

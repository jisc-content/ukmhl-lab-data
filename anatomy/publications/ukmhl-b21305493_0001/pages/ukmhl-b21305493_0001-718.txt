CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 516 between them, which would be of no use in the capillary system. Although the anatomical disposition is the same in the dead and in the living subject, there is evidently a material difference in the latter, in respect to the course of the fluids through the capillary system. If different thin fluids be injected through the aorta, after having destroyed life, by opening that artery to adapt a cock to it, they are never seen to fill the capillary system, to shower from the exhaling, the excretory ves- sels, &c., as occurs when the subject has been for some time deprived of life. The organic sensi- bility of the part, repels the injection; this fluid can only circulate in large trunks that afford considerable space. I have frequently injected, although with other views, both the arteries and veins, but have never seen the capillary system ad- mit of the fluids; they circulate in the large vessels only, when the animal can bear them. Buniva has also made comparative experiments by injec- tions both of living and dead animals; in the former he found a degree of resistance not ex- isting in the latter. Now this resistance is in the capillary system, whose tubes reject a fluid not suitable to their organic sensibility.

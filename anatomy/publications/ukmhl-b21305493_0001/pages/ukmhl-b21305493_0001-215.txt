CELLULAR SYSTEM. 73 The appearances of the dead body thus in- jected are very fallacious ; they are produced by the mechanical propulsion of fluid in the exhalants; whereas, according to the degree of their sensi- bility, they rejected the blood in a living state. If we dissect the cellular membrane in a living animal, we shall find that it has the same whitish hue as in the subject, and that large trunks, which do not form any part of its organization, distribute in their course various branches and ramifications, which are obviously lost in this tissue. We distend the subcutaneous tissue by removing the skin from the subjacent organs, and in the middle we may discern various minute branches which terminate in it. This is remarka- ble in dogs. If we previously inflate the cellular tissue, the experiment will be still more successful. We perceive how the blood varies in these vessels. It frequently happens, when the tissue has been some time exposed to the action of air, that the number of these vessels which existed at the moment of denudation are more than doubled. Wherever we examine any part that is laid bare, we shall find striking varieties in its appearance. In such instances, it is the blood which is engaged in the exhaling vessels, and appears thus to multiply the number of the mi- nute arteries. VOL. 1. N

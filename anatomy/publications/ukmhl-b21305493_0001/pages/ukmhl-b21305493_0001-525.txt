OF THE RED BLOOD. 383 expelled ; from whence it results that a certain time elapses before the blood can be conveyed from the heart to the general capillary system, that it remains in the arteries during a particular number of contractions, and is expelled in suc- cession only ; a favourable circumstance to pro- mote the intermixture of the different principles it is composed of. From this manner of viewing the arterial mo- tion, and which is the only correct one, the only one that is admissible, it is evidently impossible that the curvatures should obstruct this motion, an inference that is likewise established by nu- merous facts. I also consider as void of foundation, all that has been set forth in books on physiology, in respect to the causes of obstructions in circulation. 1st. By its transition from a narrow canal into one more extensive, and by the conical form of the general arterial system ; 2dly. By friction ; 3diy. By the angles ; 4thly. By anastomosis, in which the im- pulse is opposed, &c. &c. All this would be per- fectly correct if the arteries were empty at the time of contraction, because then the blood would really undergo a progressive motion; but in the general and simultaneous shock received by the whole mass in the arterial system, these causes evidently do not exist. I shall again have recourse to the trivial but very correct simile of the syringe. Let us imagine that a tube

general considerations. Ixvii Since every organized tissue has every where a general arrangement, and, whatever its situation may be, retains the same structure and properties, <&c., its diseases must unquestionably be every where the same. It imports nothing whether it be the serous membrane which is called tunica arach- noides in the brain, or pleura in the lungs, or peri- cardium in the heart, or peritoneum in the abdo- men, &c. The membrane inflames every where the same ; its dropsies are every where alike, and throughout its whole extent it is subject to small grey tubercles, like millet seeds, which I have not yet described, although they deserve especial consideration. I have already remarked, and not unfrequently, that these tubercles, peculiar to the serous tissue, are, like most cutaneous eruptions, chronic in their course. I shall speak of them hereafter. The affections of the mucous tissues, whatever organs they belong to, wear almost always the same character, with some exceptions for the varieties proceeding from the difference of structure. It is the same with the fibrous and cartilaginous tissues, &c. The art is deeply in- debted to Pinel, who first divided inflammation according to the organs affected, and embraced in one sweeping and comprehensive view its different species as exhibited in the different tissues of the same organ. There are uniformly two distinct orders of symptoms in inflammation. 1st. Those depending

Both are remarkable ; 1st, Because their attachment at this origin from the brain is strongly marked, and on removing the pia-mater they can never be carried off; 2dly, They are much softer than the greater part of the other nerves. The tuber annulare, and its extensions, including those that proceed to the brain, that go to the cerebellum and that which begins the spinal marrow, furnish the gene- ral motors of the muscles of the eye, the pathetic, whose origin, although posterior, is evidently from the corpus annulare, the trigemini, the mo- tor externus of the eye, the fascial nerve, the audi- tory, the par vadum, the glosso, pharyngeal, and the great hypoglossal. All these nerves are re- markable for distinctive characteristics. 1st, As the medullary substance is in every in- stance exterior to the different eminences from which they proceed, they all evidently appear to be continuous with that substance ; 2d, Almost every one of them begin by several separate filaments from each other; at times these are found very numerous, as in the trigemini and in the par vagum. The preceding ones on the con- trary arise, the one from a single filament, the other from two; 3dly, Excepting the auditory nerve, all from their very origin have a more striking consistence than the preceding; 4thly,

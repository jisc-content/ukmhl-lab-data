CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 625 portion is not returned to the heart, because, as I have previously stated, the acceleration is in a reverse ratio to the capacity. Various causes at every moment determine the blood to the general capillary system, from the natural impulse by which it is conveyed from the arteries to the veins : these causes are especially the exhalations, secretions, and nutrition. The capillary system is, as I have previously stated, a common reservoir, from which the blood is con- veyed in various, and even quite opposite direc- tions, on one part towards the veins, on another towards the exhaling organs, on a third towards the excretory tubes, and finally, on a fourth into the nutritive organs. In the capillary system of the lungs, on the contrary, there is but one single impulse, a sole direction ; it is that which conveys the blood from the artery to the pulmonary veins: in this motion nothing diverts the fluid; for, on being changed in colour from black into red, the blood does not contribute to any function; there are no vessels towards which its motion is directed, ex- cept the pulmonary veins. This then is an impor- tant difference in the blood of the capillary vessels of the lungs, and that of all the other parts; namely, that the first is moved in one direction only; that the whole mass of that fluid which enters the lungs is instantly conveyed in that direction, whilst the other follows three or four different directions. Hence, this must necessarily oscillate

At least, Desault has had an opportunity of dissecting two subjects affected with this disease, in which the nerves were similar to those of the opposite side. This, however, requires a more accurate examina- tion, because it may happen, that in several in- stances, the internal substance of the nervous cord is a little injured; for I have the sciatic nerve of a subject who had experienced the most acute pains along its course, and which exhibits in its superior part a number of small varicous dilatations proceeding from the veins, by which it is pene- trated. Influence of the Cerebral Nerves on the Organic Properties of the other Parts. Do the cerebral nerves influence the organic sensibility of other parts?â€”I believe not, and this is the material difference by which it is dis- tinguished from animal sensibility, so little un- derstood, particularly in its natural state and in

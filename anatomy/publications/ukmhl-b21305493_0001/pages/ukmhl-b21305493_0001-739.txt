CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. i 97 blood,â€”even in those in which the mesentery is nearly as transparent as in frogs; in young Gui- nea pigs, for instance, it has appeared to me, that to trace the motion of the blood in the capillary vessels is infinitely more difficult. It is easily perceived, however, that all the phenomena of inflammation in the different erup- tions, in tumours, &c. are especially grounded on the facility with which the blood in the capillary system may flow in a great variety of direcions, according to the parts to which it is determined by irritation. From what has hitherto been stated, it is evi- dent, that sometimes the blood moves slowly through the capillary system; that at other times it is circulated in these vessels with more rapidity; how then can the connection, constantly the same between the arterial and veinous circulations, be accounted for? It is thus. These irregular oscil- tions seldom take place but in a particular part only of this system ; in no case whatever is the whole mass disturbed ; thus, if the circulating fluid be but gently moved in the capillary system of the skin, it will circulate with additional rapidity in those of the cellular membrane, muscles, &c. Such, in fact, is an invariable law in the vital powers, that if their energy be increased in one part, it is reduced in another. It might be said, that there is only a certain quantity in the whole economy which may be distributed in different proportions, but is never increased or decreased in the sum

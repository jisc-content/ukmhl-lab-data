NERVOUS SYSTEM 210 may also be remarked, that the parts that are the most abundantly provided with this mem- brane, as the scrotum, the mediastinum, &c. &c. are not those which sympathise the most. The same may be said of blood vessels, which, by their very nature, are unfit to propagate animal sensibility, and which besides are not always met with in every organ. It would seem that all sympathetic pains are nothing but an aberration from the internal sen- sitive principle that conveys to a part a sensation, the cause of which resides in another organ. Thus, when the extremity of a stump causes pain in a patient who has undergone amputation, the principal skin that feels does actually suffer. But he mistakes the part from whence it proceeds ; he refers it to the foot, which is removed. It is the very same when a stone irritates the bladder. It is the glands that feel the pain. Thus, all sym- pathy in animal sensibility is characterised by the perfection of the part to which we refer the sen- sation, and by the cessation of that sympathetic pain which ceases the moment that the cause ope- rating elsewhere has been removed. It is then probable, that when a part is sympathetically af- fected, that the part which is the seat of the es- sential cause of the pain, first acts upon the brain, either by the nerves, or by some means we are unacquainted with, and that when this viscus has perceived the sensation conveyed to it, it mis-

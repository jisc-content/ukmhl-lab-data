OF ANIMAL LIFE. 159 nomena takes place the soonest in these. On the contrary, the nervous substance seems to resist pu- trefaction for a much longer time. The nerves are even amongst those parts in the animal economy that are the least disposed to putrefy. During life,â€™they are frequently seen perfectly sound in a mortified limb, or in the very centre of an abscess, &c. In the dead body undergoing putrefaction, they still preserve their whiteness and their con- sistence, although surrounded on every part with putrefied substances, and in the very midst of ge- neral dissolution. I have observed that the water made use of in macerating nerves hardly exhales any smell; whilst that employed for the brain becomes foetid and offensive. These phenomena would evidently not take place if the medullary substance of the nerve yielded to putrefaction as easily as that of the brain. However, it is evi- dent that it is specially to the theca or nevrileme that the nerves are indebted for this kind of in- corruptibility ; for I have ^observed that the optic nerve, in which the eelhEtlltr substance predomi- nates, that the olfactory and the auditory nerves, thiiriieinxLlffEQijLVeiToTTfcl, undergo dissolution more y^speedily than others. I have also constantly ob- served, that whilst the white substance of the spi- nal marrow is corrupting, its sheath remains unchanged. 3dly.

ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 716 very striking redness, along the course of the sub- cutaneous absorbents in the inferior extremities, terminating all the inguinal glands, or even ex- ceeding them, producing the most acute pains, is a phenomenon frequently observed in diseases. In cuts with an instrument impregnated with any virus, in the acute pain attending the whitlow, &c., a very painful sensation is frequently expe- rienced along the absorbents of the upper extre- mities. In their natural state, when irritated in various ways, which is easily performed, the lymphatic glands do not appear to possess animal sensibility. Inflammation, however, is apt to develope it in these glands as well as in the absorbents, by in- creasing considerably their organic sensibility. Thus pain is very acute ; if these glands become inflamed subsequent to a puncture made with an infected instrument, or after a sprain, the acute sufferings that attend those of the arm-pit when they are obstructed and suppuration takes place* are sufficiently known ? Shall I mention those felt in the mesenteric glands when cancerous ? or what is much more common in buboes, &c. &c. Neither the absorbents nor the glands are pos- sessed of animal sensibility. The organic properties of the absorbents present the following disposition; Haller admits that sensible contractility exists in this system. He formed this opinion from having observed that the lymphatics readily emit the

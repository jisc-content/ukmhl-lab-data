444 VASCULAR SYSTEM circulations;â€”why these three reverse ones ; 1st. Strength in the parieties ; 2dly. Rapidity of mo- tion ; 3dly. A reduced capacity essentially cha- racterize the arteries of the two vascular systems. From this we may also conceive why, although the veinous and arterial circulations form in their whole extent but one continued column, and al- though the common membrane in which they move, is throughout both systems nearly the same, yet the organs superadded to this mem- brane are very different. The reverse connection, between the accelera- tion and the capacity of the vessels, appears to me so very evident, that, from the inspection of a vessel, the degree of rapidity with which the fluid circulates through it, might nearly be ascer- tained, if numerous causes did not at the time of death occasion numberless variations in the vascu- lar parieties. It is well known, that every cause, which lessens in the veins the rapidity of the blood, increases their capacity : thus it is that ligatures serve to increase them ; that pregnancy enlarges those of the lower regions ; that a fixed posture continued for some time will produce the same effect, &c. The following phenomenon must also be refer- red to the very same cause ; namely, that the connection between the arteries and the veins is not every where the same ; thus, the renal bron- chial veins, those of the thymus gland, &c. are

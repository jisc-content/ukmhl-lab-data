general considerations. XXXV11 Diseases, on the contrary, which affect organic life, more particularly as fevers, inflammations, &c. imbibe their elements as well from the fluids as from solids. On this account it is that these diseases are subject to crises, and are cured by evacuants, alteratives, &c. 2dly. To decide the question respecting the state of the solids and fluids in disease, it is necessary to distinguish the phenomena of those that are sympathetic from those that are pro- duced by a direct excitement. Every phenomenon of sympathy has its principle essentially and necessarily inherent in the solids ; in fact, the so- lids alone re-act on each other, and are connected together by these media which are yet unknown. Vomiting, febrile agitation of the heart, exhalation, secretion, absorption, by sympathy, are dependent on some change which has been wrought by the influence of a part more or less remote over these solids, which are the seat of these phe- nomena. If the skin be chilled in a state of perspiration, the pleura is immediately affected by sympathy. Cold water taken into the sto- mach whilst the body is heated, will frequently excite disorder in a distant organ. This is sym- pathy, and not repercussion of the humors. I have in this work adduced innumerable exam- ples of sympathies in the different systems, so that in no case I believe can we conceive a dis- tinct disease of fluids.

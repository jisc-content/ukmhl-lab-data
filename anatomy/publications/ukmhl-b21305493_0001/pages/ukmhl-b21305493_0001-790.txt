648 EX HALANT SYSTEM. stances to repair the waste, and that these sub- stances must necessarily require vessels to convey them. These vessels can certainly receive what they deposit from the capillary system only from which they proceed. If by injections or other means they cannot be accurately demonstrated, it appears to me that this argument would be suf- ficient for that purpose.. Physiologists have not hitherco arranged the different exhalations within the same class. Each was individually exposed on treating of the sys- tem in which it takes place. I have also produced such reflections respecting each in my exposure of the different tissues as the general anatomical order required ; but in books, or in physiological lectures, it is evident that these, as well as absorp- tion, should be represented in the same light. SECTION III. Difference of Exhalations. Although we are unacquainted with the struc- ture of the exhalants, yet it cannot be doubted that this structure must vary considerably in the different systems. These tubes being, as it were, elements in the organs they contribute to form, they must necessarily partake of the distinctive characters peculiar to each.

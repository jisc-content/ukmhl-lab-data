No exhalants in the economy pour out blood more frequently than the mucous : thus are these affections nearly characteristic of the mucous sur- faces, wherein they assumed different names ac- cording to the parts affected ; it is not my object to describe here these phenomena ; I shall only prove that they are actual exhalations. 1st. I have frequently dissected subjects that had died from hemorrhage, and in this respect I have had numerous opportunities of examining the surfaces of the bronchiae, the stomach, intestines, and uterus, but notwithstanding the precaution I had taken of washing them clean, and submitting them to maceration before I inspected them through the magnifying glass, the slightest ap- pearance of erosion could never be found. 2dly. The following is an experiment per- formed on the womb of subjects that have died during menstruation, or even at other times, and which will never fail: by pressing upon the mucous surface of the uterus, a greater or less number of minute drops of blood, evidently corresponding to the vascular tubes, which on being cleared away, leave no mark of erosion. 3dly.

549 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. To convey a correct idea of the capillary sys- tem in these kinds of organs, let us select one in which it maybe easily examined, that of the serous membranes, for instance. When laid bare in a living animal, the small quantity of blood con- tained in their capillary tubes is easily ascer- tained through the transparency of that mem- brane ; under this tissue numerous ramifications are met with, but they seem to be contiguous only with the system ; for instance, if in a young Guinea pig we remove the peritoneal coat of the stomach, the red arteries that at first sight had appeared inherent to this coating, remain uninjured : the whitish or greyish appearance of these membranes is undoubtedly owing to the small quantity of blood their minute tubes, arising from the subsequent trunks, contain. If after hav- ing thus laid bare a serous membrane, to ascertain the quantity of blood it contains in the natural state, it be irritated by any means whatever, after a longer or shorter space of time it will be covered with innumerable reddish streaks, so mul- tiplied even as to convert their whitish appear- ance into that peculiar to the mucous surfaces. If we inject a fine fluid into a dead body, it will so completely fill the capillary system of the se- rous surfaces, that of the peritoneum for instance, that these surfaces will appear completely black, and formed only of an intricate net-work, whilst m the living subject very few of these vessels

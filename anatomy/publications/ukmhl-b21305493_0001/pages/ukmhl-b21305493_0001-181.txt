39 CELLULAR SYSTEM. interstices or cells that are formed by its several laminae vary in size : they are particularly capa- cious in the eyelids and scrotum, and also in such parts as have little or no fat. The dimensions how- ever of these cells are exceedingly variable, and as they admit of contraction and dilatation, no- thing positive can be ascertained in this respect. When filled with fat or serum, they are many degrees larger than what they are when empty. It is these variations in the capacity of the cells of the system we are now examining, which determine the various differences in the general bulk of the body, from the state of cor- pulence to that of emaciation, in both which states the size of every muscular fibre and nervous filament remains almost entirely the same, and in which this system only undergoes a change. In cases of dropsy we observe the same variations when we compare the usual state of the body. The figure of the cells is also so various that they cannot be described in a general manner; some are circular, some quadrilateral, &c., and all curiously mingled together. The best way of investigating them, is to submit an infiltrated limb to congelation: a thousand small icicles will form and assume the shape of the containing cells. Inflation is again a useful method : I have frequently by this experiment ascertained the shape of cells in the markets where meat is in-

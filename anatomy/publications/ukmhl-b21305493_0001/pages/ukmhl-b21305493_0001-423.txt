Such is the disposition of the two folds by which it is separated, that even in cases in which the foramen ovale continues open after birth, the black blood cannot intermix with the red, and the two hearts ought to be equally con- sidered as independent, at least in respect to the circulation of the blood. This complete separa- tion of the two circulations is one of their most striking characteristics ; it proves alone how much the point of view in which I have represented cir- culation in general is preferable to that in which it is divided in large and small, which are evi- dently confounded and identified with each other. From what has been stated above, both the origin and termination of the two circulations exist in two capillary systems, which are, as it were, limits between which the two kindfc of blood are in motion. The lungs answer alone in this re- spect to different parts of the body. The capil- lary system it contains, is, (with a slight excep- tion in the parts from which the blood of the vena porta proceeds,) opposed to that of all the other organs. Each capillary system is then at the same time both an origin and a termination. The pulmonary is the origin of the circulation of VOL. II. c c

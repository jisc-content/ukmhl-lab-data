OK THE RED BLOOI). 3r/9 Phenomena relative to the Impulsion of the Heart. What part then do arteries take in pulsation ? The following is what takes place in this import- ant phenomenon : As arteries are incessantly filled with blood, the shock conveyed to them from the left ventricle is suddenly felt throughout the whole system to its most distant parts. Let us figure to ourselves a syringe, provided with an in- finite number of branches proceeding from the main tube, which branches successively produce a number of smaller ones ; by pressing the piston, all these ramifications being filled with fluid, it is evident that it will pass out on all sides from the open extremities at the moment the impulse is given. Now, let us suppose, that instead of the piston being forced, the side of the syringe could be suddenly made to collapse, the fluid would 1 • a . tJ: < -•.-v- <■ J'/lsGa- be instantaneously emitted through every issued Another simile may render this more obvious :— If we strike the end of a long beam, the move- ment is suddenly felt at the opposite extremity. From these instances, we may form a correct idea of what takes place at the very moment the left ventricle contracts. Much has been said about a flow of blood distributed in the whole arterial system, proceeding from the two ounces of blood conveyed to the arteries at every pulsation. The arterial motion might thus be conceived, if the 1 1 2

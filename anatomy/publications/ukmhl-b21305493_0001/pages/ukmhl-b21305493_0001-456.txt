31# VASCULAR SYSTEM just been examining, the arteries terminate in the general capillary system. To point out where this system begins, and where arteries terminate, would be# difficult task. We might easily prove that it is tfc(?re where the blood ceases to be en- tirely under the influence of the heart, and so cir- culates only by the power of the insensible or- ganic contractility of the vascular parieties; but how is it possible to make this distinctive line sensible to the eye ? Authors, in treating upon the termination of arteries, have viewed their continuity with the excretories, the exhalants, the veins, &c.; but it is evident that the general capillary system is intermediate to the arteries and to these vessels. Thus I shall treat of their origin in mentioning this system, which is distributed in all the organs, but which, in respect to its continuity with the arteries, displays essential distinctions according to the different systems. In fact, there are sys- tems where these vessels are distributed with pro- fusion, and in which consequently the general capillary system contains a considerable quantity of blood : such are the glandular, the mucous, the cutaneous, the muscular, both of animal and or- ganic life, &c.; 2dly. Other systems are but sparingly provided with arteries, as the bony, the fibrous, the serous, &c., and consequently that part of the general capillary system which belongs to them contains but little blood.

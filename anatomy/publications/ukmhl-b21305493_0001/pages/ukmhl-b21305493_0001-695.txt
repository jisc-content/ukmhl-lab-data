Although the capillary vessels exist in every part of the body, yet they are found more or less nu- merous according to the respective organs : how- ever indifferently the fine injections be introduced, they still clearly establish the fact. What anatomist has not been surprised at the prodigious number of vessels displayed by this means in the skin, in serous surfaces, in the cellular tissue, &c., when compared with those it presents in the fibrous organs, even in the very muscles, &c. ? I have sought for the cause of this difference, and had no difficulty in making the discovery ; by remarking that wherever a few capillary ves- sels only were ascertained by injection, the pro- cess of nutrition only was carried on : of this, the bones, the muscles, cartilages, and fibrous bodies, afford constant proofs; that, on the contrary, in all organs that admit of many fluids, besides nu- trition, other functions, such as exhalation and secretion, are effected. This explains why a serous surface, nearly as white in the living sub- ject as cartilage, acquires by injection a much deeper hue; why the skin, compared to the VOL. i. u u

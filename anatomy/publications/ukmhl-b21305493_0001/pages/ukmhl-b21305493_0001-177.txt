CELLULAR SYSTEM. 35 connected, first, with that of the pelvis round about the peritoneum, afterwards with that of the inferior extremities, by means of the various apertures, the abdominal ring and crural arch particularly. The first of these openings establishes a cellular communication between the abdomen and the genitals, particularly in man. These com- munications are easily brought into view by injecting a fluid into the abdominal cellular tissue of the subject, it penetrates with the greatest ease into the lower extremities while it requires some force to propel it into the superior. It is almost generally known, that there is scarcely any case of ascites which is not attended with infiltration in the lower extremities, whilst the upper remain unaffected. The cellular tissue then of the abdomen, as Portal and Bordeu have correctly remarked, is especially connected with that of the lower extremities, in the same way as the cellular tissue of the thorax commu- nicates with that of the upper extremities. It is to be observed however, that the former are much sooner affected by the diseases of the ab- domen, than the latter by those of the thorax. Cellular Tissue of the Pelvis. There are few parts in the animal oeconomy, in which the organ now commanding our atten- tion has been distributed with more profusion than the pelvis. It exists in great abundance

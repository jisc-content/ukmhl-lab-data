450 VASCULAR SYSTEM dent that the connection existing between them is remarkably visible, that it is subordinate to the mode of death, to the diseases that have preceded, to the habits of the subject, &c. Let us then, on this point, as well as on all others, lay calculations aside, which even if founded on solid grounds could answer no useful purpose. Injections are also deceitful when used to as- certain this connection; in fact, they dilate the trunks much more than the branches, and these more particularly than the ramifications. The internal jugular vein for instance, when injected acquires almost an enormous size, when compared with the sinuses that empty into it. The venae cavae, the azygos vein, the subclavian, &c. are rather less dilated than the jugular, but their vo- lume becomes very remarkable on injection, when compared with that of their injected branches. â€¢ Anastomosis. In general, veins communicate more frequently than arteries. 1st. In the ramifications, anasto- mosis is so multiplied as to form a perfect net- work. 2ndly. They are not so numerous in the smaller branches. 3dly. In the branches they are still less numerous, although in considerable quantity, and it is this which particularly distin- guishes the branches of the veins from those of the arteries, which are nearly ^always separate

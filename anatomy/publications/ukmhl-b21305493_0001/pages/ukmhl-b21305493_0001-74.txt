GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XXXIV dentally admitted through the medium of the lungs. This is an undoubted fact. Here is then a three-fold gate opened to disease, as we shall have frequent occasion of perceiving in the course of this work. 4thly, There is another accidental oneâ€”I mean, incised and lacerated wounds, which frequently convey some de- structive principles into the animal economy. These are four heads to which we must refer a multitude of cases in which the fluids are the primary causes of disease, are the essential me- dium of its principles, and become unnatural stimuli to the solids, producing in them pheno- mena contrary to the natural order. Thus it appears, that it is the fluids especially intended for the composition of our organs that convey morbific principles; they are the vehicles of disease. On the contrary, fluids intended for decomposition, rid the economy of noxious and offending matters. We have seen that these fluids are every where poured out from the mucous surfaces and skin, either by exhalation or secretion, as perspiration, urine, mucous juices, &c. It is then through their means that the crisis of disease takes place.

If these fluids are some- times the vehicle of disease, it is when they

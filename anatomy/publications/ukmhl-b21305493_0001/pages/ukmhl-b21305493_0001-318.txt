NERVOUS SYSTEM 176 merits separate, and lay by the side of each other. Thus distended, these filaments can sometimes convey sensations and motions ; on other occa- sions these two functions are completely annihi- lated. In general they are more effectually checked by a sudden distension than by that which is brought on gradually. For this reason, the head of the humerus, in luxations of the arm, frequently produces palsies; whilst in large chronic tu- mours of the arm-pit, this seldom happens. The spontaneous luxations of the vertebrae, which generally follow a chronic course, are seldom at- tended with paralysis,â€”an accident which is al- ways the result of those luxations occasioned by mechanical violence. Thus it is that in the brain osseous tumours and large fungouses, that increase slowly, but very slightly disturb its functions, whilst the least depression in any part of the scull, when it is the result of a fracture, completely subverts them. For the same reason, in hydro- cephalus, a large collection of serum will hardly ever injure sensibility ; whilst again, if a small proportion more than usual of this fluid be sud- denly exhaled in the ventricles, it will nearly an- nihilate it, as is the case in certain apoplexies. When some considerable region, as the abdo- men, has been distended, the nerves in these parts yield partly, because their flexibility has disap^ peared, and partly because they are really

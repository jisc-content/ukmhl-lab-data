279 OF THE RED BLOOD. which membrane, being extended through the pulmonary veins in the left cavities of the heart and in the whole arterial system, may really be considered as a general and continuous canal, strengthened externally in the pulmonary veins by a loose membrane, in the heart by a fleshy covering, thin in the auricle, and compact in the . ventricle, in the arterial system by a fibrous coat of a peculiar nature. In those varieties of organs that are adventitious to its structure, this mem- brane remains, as we shall see, almost every where the same. Circulation of the Dark Blood. The circulation of the dark blood takes place in an inverse manner to the preceding. It has its origin in the general capillary system ; it is in this system that the blood assumes the peculiar character that distinguishes it from the preced- ing ; and it is here that it is, as it were, regene- rated, owing, probably, to the subtraction of the aerial principles it has acquired at its termi- nation in the lungs. From this general capillary system it is received into the veins, which con- vey it to the right cavities of the heart, from whence it is propelled through the pulmonary artery to the capillary system of the lungs: this system is its real termination, as it is also the source from which the red blood flows; a general

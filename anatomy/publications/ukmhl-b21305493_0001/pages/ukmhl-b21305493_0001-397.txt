255 OF ORGANIC LIFE. I have submitted several ganglions to this experi- ment, on account of the opinion of Scarpa, who conceived that these organs were penetrated with this fluid, at least in corpulent subjects. Ganglions receive a great number of blood vessels. These penetrate them on every side ; at first they ramify in the kind of cellular coat which incloses them, then entering their substance, they divide and are lost in numerous anastomoses, and in continuation with the exhalants that con- vey the nutritive matter. Fine injections display a very great quantity of vessels in these little organs. Nutrition supposes within them the presence of exhalants and absorbents. SECTION III. Properties. It is very difficult to analyze the properties of the tissue in ganglions. As to the vital proper- ties they cannot be produced, exist, and be nourished, without organic sensibility, and in- sensible organic contractility. Animal, and the sensible organic contractility are not evident in these organs. In respect to animal sensibility: this is what I have observed on opening the ab- domen of any animal,â€”of a dog for instance ; he continues perfectly alive for some space of time, and even remains calm after the first moments of

OF THE RED BLOOD. 353 have different diameters; this depends solely upon the moment of death. If, for want of blood, the arteries have remained for some time con- tracted, they continue in that state, as may be seen in the heart when death is occasioned by hemorrhage. This is so true, that arteries of different diameters usually become equal by in- jection, which produces an uniform degree of extension they cannot exceed. 7thly. In the lon- gitudinal wounds of arteries, the ends of their divided circular fibres retract, by which a space, that always continues, is left between them. The greater part of authors have confounded the contractility of the arterial texture with irritability. It is not requisite to point out here how much they have been deceived. Not one of the preceding cases requires that a stimulant should be applied to the arterial tex- ture ; the only indispensable condition, is the want of extension, a distinctive characteristic of the contractibility of the texture ; besides, it is evi- dent that this property is manifested after death, although less sensibly than during life; whilst a few hours after life has ceased, all kind of irrita- bility has completely disappeared. I believe it is especially in the arterial system that the advan- tage to be derived from my division of the pro- perties of our organs may be seen. If we read all the authors on this system, we shall find that they do not understand each other, because they

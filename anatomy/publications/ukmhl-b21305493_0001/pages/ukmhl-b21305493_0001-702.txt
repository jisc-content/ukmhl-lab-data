560 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. secretion displays the contrary disposition. We shall begin with the exhalations. 1st. The cutaneous exhalation, as I have pre- viously stated, is active whenever it follows violent exertion, fever, the action of caloric on the body^ hard labour, &c.: in these cases the skin is more ex- panded, of a deeper colour, more blood is conveyed to it, &c. This excitement of the skin renders it more susceptible of being acted upon by external causes, to influence in turn the other organs. It is the suppression of these kind of perspirations that occasions so much mischief in the animal economy. If, on the contrary, the surface of the body be examined during the colliquative sweats of phthi- sis, during those occasioned by internal suppura- tions, those produced by fear, and all that are included under the denomination of colliquative, &c. the body will then be found paler than in the natural state ; it is not susceptible of being influenced, because its vital activity is then rather low, and its powers in a languid state. 2dly. Amongst the exhalations of serous sur- faces, some are essentially active : such is that of pus ; for we shall find that the secretion of this fluid in these membranes is attended with no kind of erosion, that it evidently flows from the exha- ling vessels in the place of serum ; these two fluids even, often flow together. Nothing in fact is more frequent than the milky and purulent

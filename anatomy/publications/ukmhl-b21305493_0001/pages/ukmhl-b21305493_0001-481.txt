OF THE RED BLOOD. 339 having previously intercepted the course of the blood above and below, such as the carotid for instance, I have never, I say, found the diminu- tive arteries to penetrate as deep as the internal membrane. To distinguish correctly the vessels of arteries, without the help of injections, it is requisite on one hand, to choose a large trunk, as the aorta, on the other hand, to take that trunk in a young animal, killed for the purpose by strangulation; all the diminutive arteries are then strongly injected with a very dark-coloured blood. If we examine the arteries of the foetus, particularly if at the event of birth death has been caused by asphyxia, we shall be amazed at the great quantity of blood vessels its arteries (which are sometimes livid with them) contain. The veins accompany every part of the mi- nute arteries in the walls of the arterial trunks; they have nearly the same distribution. I have never seen them become so completely varicous in the parieties of arteries affected with aneurism, as in the tumours of numerous other textures in the animal economy. Cellular Texture. The arteries are outwardly provided with two kinds of cellular texture, that which is external is loose, impregnated with fat, filled with a serous fluid, and composed of distinct layers,

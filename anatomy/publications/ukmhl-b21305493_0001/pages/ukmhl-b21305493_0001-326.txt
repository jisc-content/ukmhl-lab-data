NERVOUS SYSTEM 184 produce in a very distant part a host of pheno- mena, the causes of which frequently escape us, although the case might easily be discovered, were we only to reflect upon the distribution of the branches proceeding from the trunk that may have been injured. Why is it, that in these phenomena the animal sensibility of the nerve is always increased below the affected part ? Why does not this pheno- menon take place in that part towards the brain, although it is in this direction that sensation is conveyed in the state of health ? This I can- not account for. No other system amongst those in which all the parts, as in that of the nerves, are conjoined, pre- sents the same phenomenon. The arterial, the veinous, the absorbent, systems are never similarly influenced in their different ramifications, by the affections of any part whatever of their trunk. The cellular system is never found affected in a part remote from the diseased one. In the mucous system, which is continuous, the irritation of one part may be communicated to another, as when a stone in the bladder occasions pain in the ex- tremity of the glands ; but then, there is always an intermediate part more or less extensive, which is not painful: it is a real sympathy; whilst in this case, from the affected part to the very ex- tremities, all suffers in the nervous trunk.

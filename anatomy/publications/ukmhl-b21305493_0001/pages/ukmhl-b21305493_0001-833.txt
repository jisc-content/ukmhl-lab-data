ABSOKBANT SYSTEM. 691 For these reasons, it was requisite that the same means should exist to promote lymphatic circula- tion, as to facilitate that of the veins. Anasto- moses, in particular, afford these means, through them the former of these motions is continued, notwithstanding the pressure of our clothing, in different parts of the body, and of the viscera upon each other. Thus, the womb being much in- creased in pregnancy, weighs heavily upon the lower extremities, and frequently causes infiltra- tions in those parts. T see no other internal or- gan, that like this, might, on account of its situation, occasion, by its pressure, these general infiltrations. The liver and the other organs are not calculated to produce a similar phenomenon ; whenever dropsy proceeds from affections of these parts, it is rather from the increased action of the exhalants that the evil proceeds. Remarks on the difference oj Dropsies, accordingly as they are produced by an increase of Exhala- tion or deficiency of Absorption. This, in respect to dropsies, leads to a point that appears to me of the utmost importance, namely, to ascertain when these affections are produced by a want of action in the absorbents, and when they proceed from an increased action of the exhalants.

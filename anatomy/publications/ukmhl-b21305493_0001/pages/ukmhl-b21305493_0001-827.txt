ABSORBANT SYSTEM. G85 age, they are sometimes more apparent, at other times scarcely perceptible. In peculiar dropsies they are found increased to double, or even treble, their natural state. Several authors have stated that they have seen branches nearly equal in size to the thoracic duct, and superior to the trunk of the right ride. To ascertain accurately the immense number of the absorbents without the help of injections, we should select the lymphatic glands in different parts, then dissect with atten- tion the surrounding parts, and the absorbents that resort to these glands will be found without difficulty. We may then be convinced of the great variety in their size, and although not in- jected, they may, by this method, be traced to a considerable distance. Sometimes, in order to find the end of the thoracic duct, I used to select a gland near the second lornbar vertebra, then by following the empty lymphatics that proceed from this gland towards the duct, I have found it without the least difficulty. With those that are not in the habit of finding the absorbents immediately this method must in- fallibly succeed; it cannot, in fact, be made use of in the extremities; but in the chest, and in the abdomen particulary, it affords great facility : for instance, in passing from the inguinal glands, these vessels may be traced as far as the thoracic duct, either by injecting them, or even without

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 79 be a rapid and prodigious dilatation, ending quickly in death. It is the peculiar density of the surrounding sheath that secures the slow and insensible progress of these tumours. One of the most striking features, in effect, of this property, extensibility, as exemplified throughout almost the whole cellular system where the la- minae, and, consequently, the cells are united, is the instantaneous and unexpected manner in which it is called into operation. We have a very re- markable instance of this mode of extension in emphysema artificially produced, in consequence of which this tissue passes from a state of absolute collapse to the most powerful extension it is capa- ble of attaining. It is the same in artificial in- jections of fluids of various kinds. After frac- tures and contusions of the soft parts where swellings of an enormous bulk often suddenly disappear, a similar phenomenon is observable. The cellular tissue is unquestionably the seat of such enlargements as take place under the skin, but in nowise when they occur beneath the fascia, as the principle of extensibility is less active in the latter, and much less easily excited than in the former, and therefore resists such di- latation as is not slowly produced. Many other organs, for example, tendons, cartilages, and bones, having this principle in common with the cellular tissue, are like the fascia, equally slow of dilating. The softness of their original

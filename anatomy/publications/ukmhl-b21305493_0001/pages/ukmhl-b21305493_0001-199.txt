57 CELLULAR SYSTEM. on account of the state of the sub-cutaneous fat. In the foetus fat is accumulated in small glo- bules, more or less of a spherical form, which give it a granulated aspect. We find it fre- quently in considerable quantity in different parts. There is almost always, for instance, in this stage of life, a distinct mass or ball of fat be- tween the buccinater, masseter, and integument, which forms a distinct body from the surrounding substance, and which may be removed entirely by itself. It contributes powerfully to the plumpness for which the cheeks are remarkable at this period of early life. Fat gradually assumes a yellowish hue as the subject increases in age, and a peculiar and cha- racteristic odour withal. We perceive the dif- ference, on comparing the fat of veal with that of beef, prepared for our repast. In the dis- secting room, this distinction is not less striking between a subject ten years old and one of sixty. We frequently find a yellowish transparent fluid substance, of a jelly-like appearance, and approaching to albumen, substituted for fat in the neighbourhood of the heart, in subjects 'that have died of dropsy, 'phthisis, or long protracted visceral disease. It occurs also in other parts of similar subjects, but less frequently, appearing to partake more of the properties of gluten than oil. VOL. i. m

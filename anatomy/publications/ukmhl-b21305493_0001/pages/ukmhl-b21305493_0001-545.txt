403 OF THE RED BLOOD. it the less, to habituate it, undoubtedly, to the continued circulation for which it is intended after birth. The quantity of fluid then is greater in proportion to the time the pulmonary artery has existed, and less compared with that of the arterial canal. This disposition most evidently commands a corresponding one in the foramen ovale: in fact, if in proportion as the arterial canal contracts, this were not also reduced, the whole mass of the blood would finally ac- cumulate in the superior parts ; because instead of proceeding from these to the inferior parts, it would be wholly returned by the left auri- cle and ventricle. As the canal contracts, the foramen ovale undergoes the same change, the blood of the inferior cava, which can no longer pass entirely, begins to mix with that of the su- perior, and to enter the right auricle, then into the right ventricle ; after which, it returns by the lungs to the left auricle and ventricle, and to the aorta. What results from this ? that this artery begins to receive from the left ventricle a much greater supply of blood than can force its way through the carotids and subclavians: a part of that which reaches it flows back in its de- scending trunk, and is conveyed to the inferior parts. * In consequence of what we have just stated, it follows that the two kinds of blood in the foetus are

OF THE DARK BLOOD. 451 from each other. The communications between the branches of the veins first unite in a conspi- cuous manner their cutaneous with the internal division. Thus there is a communication between the cerebral sinuses,| and the temporal and occi- pital veins, &c. by the veins that are given off; between the internal and external jugulars by one and even two considerable trunks; between the basilic, the cephalic veins, and their nume- rous divisions, displayed in the fore arm on one part, and with the brachial, the radial, and cu- bital on the other, by different branches that plunge into the muscles between the saphenae and the crurals, tibial, peroneal, and by similar branches. Although separated from each other, the two grand divisions of the veins are then enabled to act as respective substitutes, by uniting their blood. This explains why ; 1st. By agitating the muscles of the fore arm, the current is increased in bleeding, although the muscles do not furnish many original branches to the punctured vein, which then receives the fluid from those which are compressed by the muscles; 2dly. Why in exter- nal pressure, that impedes and even prevents the motion of the blood in the superficial veins, cir- culation is continued as usual; why, for instance, if a ligature be long continued on the arm, the superficial veins previously swelled, are gradually

Sympathies. I shall divide what I have to say in respect to the sympathies of the nerves, in the same manner as what I have mentioned concerning their vital powers ; that is to say, I shall first examine the connections of every nerve with the other parts, and shall then speak of the general influence of the nervous system in sympathies, and the part it acts in such cases.

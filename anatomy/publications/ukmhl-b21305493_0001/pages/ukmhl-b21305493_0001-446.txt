304 VASCULAR SYSTEM very conspicuous by injections, particularly in the brain; but as they depend principally on the cel- lular tissue, they disappear in part when the vessel is entirely detached. Do these curvatures mode- rate the rapidity of the circulation, and is this augmented by the straightness of the arteries as much as is stated by physiologists? I think that the effects of the different directions of ar- teries have been exaggerated. The following are the proofs:—If in a living animal the hollow or- gans, as the stomach, intestines, &c. be alternately exposed when distended and when empty, we shall perceive that the circulation is equally ra- pid in both cases, although in the former the vessels are rendered almost straight by the dis- tention, and in the latter their curvature is con- siderably increased. 2dly. I opened the carotid artery of a dog, and after having examined the force of the cur- rent of the blood, the two sides of the chest were then brought into view, the lungs instantly collapsed, and the curvatures of their vessels were consequently much increased; notwithstanding this, no diminution in the force with which the blood, after having traversed the lungs, escaped from the artery, could be perceived. It was only by degrees,—and from the influence of causes, it is not my object to examine,—that it abated ; 3dly. If, in any other animal, after hav- ing opened an artery, an incision be also made in

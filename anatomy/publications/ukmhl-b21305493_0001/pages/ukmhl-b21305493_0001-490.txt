VASCULAR SYSTEM 348 us observe what happens on injecting the abdo- minal branches of the vena porta, which, being destitute of valves, can be injected as the arteries. On propelling the fluid, nothing like the locomo- tion I have just mentioned is ever seen to take place. I have frequently caused arterial blood to circulate in veins by the means of curved tubes adapted to the vessels of a living animal; for in- i stance, by establishing a communication between the carotid artery and the external jugular vein. In veins circulating arterial blood, a kind of pul- sation answering to the beating of the heart, or a sensible vibration, may be observed, but there is no real locomotion. The locomotion of arteries implies three things: 1st. An impulsive agent that impresses a motion more or less considerable to their contained circu- lating fluid. £dly. A disposition to bend, that enables the blood to straighten them by striking against their parieties. 3dly. The firmness and elasticity of these coats facilitating this direction. On the other hand, these should not be too firm. Thus, the cartilaginous texture would not be cal- culated for such locomotion. The elasticity of arteries is as striking after death as during life ; it is very essential to dis- tinguish it properly from the contractility of the texture. There are numerous points of distinc- tion ; the following are the most essential:— 1st. The contractility of the texture can only be

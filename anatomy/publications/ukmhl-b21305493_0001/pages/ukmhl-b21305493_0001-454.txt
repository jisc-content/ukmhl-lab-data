VASCULAR SYSTEM 312 between the origin of two branches be examined, either when injected or divided perpendicularly when empty, or again by taking the dimensions when it is filled with blood, it is always found to be cylindrical. Undoubtedly when viewed in its whole extent it has a conical form, in conse- quence of the progressive diminution it undergoes by projecting branches; but even in this sense it is less of a cone than a continuation of cylinders successively added to each other, and gradually decreasing. Viewed in a general sense, the arterial system on the contrary, as I have already stated, forms absolutely an inverted cone, that is to say, the basis is extended to all the parts, the summit to the heart; so that the diameter of the aorta is proportionally less than that of the sum total of its branches united together. This can be ascer- tained by comparing a trunk with two succeed- ing branches. These will exceed it in diameter; and the connection being invariably the same in all the subdivisions, we must conceive that the capacity of the arterial system progressively in- creases. This comparison, however, between the trunks and ramifications has been exaggerated by the mathematical physiologists, who have attributed to the latter a much greater preponderance over the former than in reality exits. One cause of error on this point, may consist in having mea-

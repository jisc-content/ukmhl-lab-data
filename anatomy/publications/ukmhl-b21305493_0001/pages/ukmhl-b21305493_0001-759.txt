617 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. the time when animal heat subsides varies asto- nishingly ; that the corpse remains warm for a longer or shorter space of time, particularly amongst those who have died suddenly from acute affections, the delirium of particular fevers for instance, from a fall, &c. &c. Such as have died in consequence of chronic disease lose their heat almost immediately* The difference com- pared with the former, is often three, four, or even six hours. This phenomenon proceeds from the following cause, that whenever death is sudden, it suspends the important functions only; the tonic action of the parts is still continued for a longer or shorter time. Now this action still separates some caloric from the blood that stagnates in the general capillary system. Thus, subsequent to violent death, absorption is still continued for a limited time after the subject has expired: the muscles still tremble, and the glands perhaps borrow for a few hours longer, from the blood stagnant in their capillary system, the ma- terials intended for their secretions. This difference of heat in the dead body can only proceed from the cause I have ascribed; for whenever the production of caloric has ceased in the body, that which remains sinks to a level with atmospheric air, and follows the general laws respecting it. Now these laws being uni- form, their effects must be the same in every in- vol. i. 3 a

ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 718 have contributed to undeceive me. This un- doubtedly proceeds from the vital heat, and not the artificial heat, being required for the exercise of this function, or rather vital heat and absorption are two effects of a common cause ; namely, of organic properties. As long as these properties remain adherent in the solids, they retain caloric and will absorb; the instant they disappear, heat disappears, and absorption ceases at the same time. It would be useless to expose bodies de- prived of life to the action of caloric ; they may be warmed, but will never produce any vital phenomenon. In the same manner if heat be perpetuated for some length of time in an animal recently killed, by substituting artificial for na- tural heat, it is to no purpose. It is the de- cline of organic sensibility and insensible con- tractility, that should be prevented in order that absorption may be continued, and whenever this power is retained it can only be by previously maintaining these properties. Notwithstanding what Mascagni and many others have said, ab- sorption cannot be relied upon when the animal is cold : in such instances I have frequently but un- successfully attempted to put it in action ; gene- rally speaking, I have never observed it to act more than two hours after death. Organic sen- sibility in the absorbents is connected with diffe- rent fluids, which perfectly distinguishes it from the other systems; for instance, from the glan-

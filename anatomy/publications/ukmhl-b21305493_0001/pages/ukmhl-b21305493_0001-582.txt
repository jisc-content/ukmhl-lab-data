440 VASCULAR SYSTEM that these at every moment can vary their ca- pacity, whilst the others ever remain in the same state. In the living subject the right side of the heart is almost in every instance larger than the left, because it contains a greater quantity of blood. Here then are two facts generally applicable, namely ; 1st. That the great tree which termi- nates the system of the red blood, is in general less in capacity than that which forms the com- mencement of the other ; 2dly. That the same observation is applicable to the two sides of the heart, corresponding to each of those trees. In respect to the tree which terminates the sys- tem of the dark blood, when compared with that beginning the system of the red, it is not ex- actly the same. The pulmonary artery, and the veins of that denomination, present a dispro- portion in capacity less, it is- true, than in the other parts, but really existing; and which, not- withstanding what several authors have set forth, is to the advantage of the latter. How does this happen ? It seems that since the one is a conti- nuation of the veins, that it propels the same fluid, it ought to partake of the same proportions in dia- meter, and that since the others are continued with the arteries, their capacity should also be in a relative proportion to these. This arises from the degree of rapidity with which the blood flows: in fact, this fluid circulates more rapidly

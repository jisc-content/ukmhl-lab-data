From whatever part these substances are taken, in order to try the experiment, the result is the same. Alkalies, also, act powerfully on the medullary substance of nerves, which, as I have already mentioned, has been of great service to Reil, in prosecuting his experiments. 8thly. Thouret and Fourcroy have made us familiar with the singular property that brains which have been buried, possess of changing, (after being condensed into a smaller volume than that they exhibited before,) into a brittle substance, which softens between the fingers, can be diluted in water, exhales an insipid smell, presenting the cha- racteristics of ammoniacal soap, and resembling very much the spermatic matter of the whale.

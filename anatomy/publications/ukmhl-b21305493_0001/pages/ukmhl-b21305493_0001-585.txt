143 OF THE DARK BLOOD. the pulmonary artery. 3dly. Why these four veins are not exactly proportioned to the aorta, although it is the actual continuation of them. 4thly. Why the venae cavae and coronaries are so disproportionate with the pulmonary artery, which is a continuation of them ? If there existed no impulsive agent in the two systems of the arterial and veinous circulations, their respective capacities would prove every where nearly the same, because the rapidity of the fluid would be every where alike. This is pre- cisely the case in the system of the dark abdo- minal blood, in which the hepatic part of the vena porta is nearly as large as the intestinal, because there exists no heart intermediate to them. In the general and pulmonary veins, circu- lation is slower, because their extremity is not provided with an impulsive agent; there is only a capillary system. The opposite reason accounts for the rapidity of circulation in the gene- ral and pulmonary arteries. We have found in the preceding system, that the existence of an impulsive agent at the origin of the two great ar- teries, requires a remarkable degree of resistance in this tissue, whilst the want of this organ re- quires from the veins but little resistance. We can now very easily conceive why these three facts, 1st. Weakness in the parieties; 2dly. Slowness in the motion ; 3dly. Extensive capa- city, are within the attributes of the veins in both N N 2

589 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. tliat their appearance is quite different. Let me be allowed this expression ; it is, in fact, the same individual, but assuming a different mask accord- ing to the organs he invades, so that he cannot be recognized. When will medical science have made sufficient progress for the treatment of dis- eases, to coincide with these varieties ? A general treatment is certainly required in inflammation ; but it should be differently modified, accordingly as it is intended for phlegmon, erysipelas, ca- tarrhs, &e. What follows is a convincing proof of the pe- culiar character inflammation assumes in each part. The facility and rapidity with which the blood flows in a determined part of the skin, in consequence of any irritation whatever, is suffi- ciently known ; if a part be pricked or rubbed it immediately becomes red, which is also the case in rrmcous surfaces, although in a less striking degree. This, however, is not equally observable in the serous membranes, as I have repeatedly as- certained in living animals, in which I laid these surfaces bare, to irritate them in various ways. The afflux of blood was never immediately subse- quent to the irritation; there was always a greater or less interval between the two; the least included a full hour.

general considerations. lxxxiii it. It is, consequently, to study them more care- fully, and to appreciate them with more nicety, that, in organic life, I separate the two kinds of contractility from sensibility. In the natural state they are inseparable. This explains why the pas- sive sympathies of animal sensibility are totally distinct from those of contractility of the same species, and form two separate classes, whilst the passive sympathies of organic sensibility can never be disunited from those of organic con- tractilities. Pain affects us by sympathy, and spasms by sympathy are felt distinctlyâ€”these two things are almost always separate : on the other hand, sensation and motion, in organic sympathies, are inseparable. I could, by a thousand other instances, prove that all disputes and differences of opinions, con- cerning vital properties, proceed solely from the not distinguishing those which preside over the functions of one life, from those that govern the functions of the other. Let us return to my physiological division ; I annex a table of it, which by representing it in the same point of view, will convey a more precise idea thereof. It contains, 1st, the prole- gomena or preambles of the science ; 2dly, a statement of the functions. In the prolegomena, every thing is referred to two great considerations, on one hand, to organic texture viewed in a gene- val manner, on the other, to life, considered also m its important attributes.

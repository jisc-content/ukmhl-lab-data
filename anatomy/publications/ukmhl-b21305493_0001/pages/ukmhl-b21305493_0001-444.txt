VASCULAR SYSTEM 302 that which is communicated to tumours situate in the course of a large artery, &c. &c. The trunks and branches are accompanied by veins, and in general surrounded by a quantity of fat, a circumstance that has appeared to favour the opinion of those who considered this fluid to be exhaled from the pores of the arteries. We have already stated what should be thought of this opinion. The direction of the trunks and branches is subject to variation. It is generally straight in the trunks, as in the carotid, the common iliac, and abdominal arteries, which renders the circu- lation less sensible. When these are laid bare in a living animal, no kind of locomotion is per- ceived, as in trunks that are distinctly curved. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule with regard to the direction of the trunks; the arch of the aorta is an instance, as well as the in- ternal carotid, which present numerous curves, that are erroneously thought necessary for the purpose of preventing the impetus of the blood from impairing the delicate structure of the brain. This direction being more tortuous in the branches, produces the arterial locomotion that, according to many physicians, almost exclusively constitutes the pulse.

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 12 serum, suffers no distension in dropsies, and in all diseases preserves its original state. When this out- ward tissue is removed layer by layer from the pari- eties of the veins, one may perceive that it is there dryer than in other parts. I have often been dis- posed to think it does not, like that of the arteries, excretories, and mucous surfaces, exhale that al- buminous fluid which lubricates the other parts of the cellular system. We shall find that its organi- zation is distinct in nature, and forms a manifest exception in this system. In examining the cellular sheath of veins and arteries, and particularly the latter, we must take care not to confound its filaments with the numerous nervous threads which are supplied from the ganglia, and form a plexus around them. The cellular tissue is whiter, and the nerves more of a greyish hue ; an appearance which is particu- larly striking after a few days maceration. I can say nothing of the tissue external to the absorbents, they are, doubtless, furnished with it like the veins; but such is the exquisite delicacy of these vessels, that we can avouch nothing concerning them that is supported by experience and dissection. Cellular Tissue external to the Excretory Ducts. The ducts of the salivary glands, kidneys, tes- ticles, liver and pancreas,&c. are clearly enveloped

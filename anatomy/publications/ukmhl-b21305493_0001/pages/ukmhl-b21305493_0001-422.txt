280 VASCULAR SYSTEM membrane, every where continuous, lines the whole passage of the dark blood, and affords it a general and extended canal, through which it is habitually conveyed from every part into the interior of the lungs. Nature has furnished the external part of this general canal with a loose membrane in the veins, fleshy fibres in the heart, and a peculiar fibrous texture in the pulmonary artery; but like that of the arteries, it remains nearly always uniform, notwithstanding the difference of the organs to which it is united externally. It is this general membrane which, being reflected, forms the valves in the veins; it serves to compose all those of the right side of the heart, whose cavities it lines in the same manner as the preceding in respect to the formation of the valves of the left side, which are formed by the lining membrane. Difference of the two Circulations. From the general idea I have just given of the two circulations, it appears that they are per- fectly independent of each other, excepting at the origin and termination where the red blood and the black undergo an alternate change, communi- cating together for that purpose by means of the capillary vessels. Throughout the whole of their course they are perfectly distinct. Although the two portions of the heart are united in one entire

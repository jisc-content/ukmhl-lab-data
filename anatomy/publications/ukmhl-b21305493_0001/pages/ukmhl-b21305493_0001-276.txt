134 NERVOUS SYSTEM Communication of the Cerebral Nerves at their Exit from their Bony Cavities. 1st. The two cerebral nerves proceed without communicating with any others, to their respec- tive destination. 2dly. Those of the annulary pro- tuberance, and of its appendages, begin to form communications, which are the more striking as they are observed in the inferior parts. That the par vagum and great hypoglossal nerves, in leaving their respective foramina, send forth nume- rous filaments to the neighbouring organs; whilst in the upper parts, the general motors, the pathe- tics, and even the trigemini, have this disposition in a much less degree; the auditory nerve does not communicate with any other. 3dly. The spinal nerves, are those whose communications at their exit, are the most striking, particularly in their anterior parts. The deep cervical plexus, the brachial lumbar, and sciatic, are the result of such communications, which the intercostals display in a less sensible manner. These kind of plexus present a peculiar dis- position. They are produced in the following man- ner :â€”In proceeding from the foramina, every nerve sends a branch upwards and downwards; then it receives some ; so that the cords which succeed to those projecting from the foramina, proceed from two or three of these. These second cords, on dividing, send branches upwards and

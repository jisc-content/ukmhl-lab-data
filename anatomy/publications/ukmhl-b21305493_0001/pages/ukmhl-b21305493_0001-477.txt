OF THE RED BLOOD. 335 pellicle that secures the ossified layers, when increased, arises from the excessive brittleness that we have observed in the common membrane, from which it depends. I have never found these bony layers completely loose, and left free in the artery. Every part of the arterial system is liable to ossi- fication ; it is as frequently met with in the branches as in the trunks: we are sensible how very often in feeling the pulse of an aged subject we find the radial artery ossified. Ramifications appear to be less frequently the seat of such incrustations, and they never take place in the capillary sys- tem ; a circumstance that rather induces me to believe that the common membrane of the arte- ries does not extend so far as that system, but gradually degenerates into a different texture. It is not in the common membrane of the arte- ries only, that this saline substance is deposited. This frequently occurs in the very heart itself, particularly in the aortic and mitral valves. It is not so common in the internal surfaces of the left ventricle and auricle ; in the pulmonary veins, however, I have some instances of it. This gene- ral tendency for ossification in its whole course sufficiently proves that its nature is every where similar, and that, notwithstanding the distinctions pointed out, I was perfectly correct in viewing it â€¢ m an uniform light, from the capillary system of the lungs, to that of the whole body; for as I

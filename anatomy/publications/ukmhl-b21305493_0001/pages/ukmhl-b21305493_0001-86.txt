Xlvi GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. are especially the agents of the first; the action of neutral salts, air, alcohol, &c. chiefly produce the second. These two contractions vary essentially in their results. In fact, the state to which the first reduces the organs soon changes if the cause be not withdrawn. Thus fire, in continuing its effects upon solids, soon reduces them to a hard and carbonaceous mass. 2dly. Boiling water, long applied, destroys by degrees the hardness which solids immersed suddenly acquire. As this hardness diminishes, the boiling process goes on by degrees; it attains its highest degree when the soft parts submitted to its action lose their consistency and are reduced to a complete pulp. 3dly. In the same manner organs being suddenly contracted by acids, and consequently hardened, are soon softened by it, and become pulpy. This double phenomenon, which boiling water produces on one hand, and strong acids on the other, has the strongest analogy. One with the other it seems to depend on the same principles; the only diffe- rence is, that the softness produced is infinitely more sudden and much more extensive in the latter than the former. The slow and insensible contrac- tion, or more properly hardness, produced by the contact of neutral salts, as alum,.muriate of soda, &c. air, alcohol, &c. affords a phenomenon distinct from the first. It is not changed to a state of softness by the prolonged action of the cause which has i

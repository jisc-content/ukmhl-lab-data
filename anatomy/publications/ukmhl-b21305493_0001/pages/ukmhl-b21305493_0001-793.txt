liXHALANT SYSTEM. 651 latter are identified with the former. Thus it happens, 1st. Why each separates the fluid it is peculiarly connected with ; why, consequently, when from copious drinking a great quantity of water has been admitted into the circulation, it is the cutaneous exhalants, and never the serous, that appropriate the fluid to themselves, and sub- sequently separate it from the blood. After run- ning swiftly, when the circulating mass is vio- lently agitated by the power of the heart, the cutaneous vessels, more especially excited than the serous, the synovials, &c. separate more perspi- ration, &c.: 2dly. Why the serous exhalants do not convey fat, the medullary serum, &c. although the vascular mass that enters the capillary tubes, with which they are continued, is every where the same: 3dly. Why, whenever the exhalants pour out different fluids, or whenever their natu- ral fluids are adulterated, these essentially differ from each other ; why, again, for instance, sub- sequent to inflammation on the serous surfaces only, a milky serum is to be found; why nothing similar to pus flows from the medullary mem- brane, when in a state of inflammation; why the fluids resulting from inflammation of the synovial membranes, are very distinct from those produced by the serous surfaces, &c.: 4thly. Why peculiar exhalants have more tendency than others to receive the blood, and to transmit it to their respective surfaces, an instance of which is 3 c 2

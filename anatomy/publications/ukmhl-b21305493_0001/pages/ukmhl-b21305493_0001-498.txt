356 VASCULAR SYSTEM Several authors have quoted instances of such cases. Sabatier, in particular, in his work, has mentioned several instances. section in. Vital Properties. Properties of Animal Life—Sensibility. Are arteries possessed of animal sensibility ? The following is what we learn from facts in this respect:— 1st. The ligature of an artery will cause, at times, a painful sensation ; but more frequently there is none. It is particularly in the spermatic artery that pain is sometimes smarting ; but this might be referred to nerves. 2nd. I can affirm, without exaggeration, that upon more than a hundred dogs I have made experiments, in which the carotid artery has been employed to convey different substances to the brain: but in whatever manner I irritated it, either with the knife, acids, or alkalies, &c., the animal never gave the least token of pain. Nu- merous authors have obtained analogous results. I have even observed, that it is a further proof of the kind of insensibility in the nerves of organic life, which, as we have seen, are nearly every where distributed over the arteries.

246 NERVOUS SYSTEM are none similarly disposed ; sometimes* however, a small one is observed at the basis of the heart. Besides the ganglions constantly observed, ac- cidental ones, if I may be allowed the expression, are frequently met with ; such are those some- times found in the hypogastric plexus, even in the solar plexus, at a small distance from the semi-lunar plexus, in the middle of the neck, &c. On the other hand, some of those generally observed are wanting; for instance, some of the lombar, of the sacral, the maxillary, &c.; so that in respect to existence, there is certainly an essential difference between ganglions. The superior cervical, the semi-lunar, the ophthal- mic, &c., are always present; they appear to be essentially necessary for the action of the organs, which they supply with nerves. On the contrary, the greater part of the others can be dispensed with, and the deficiency supplied by those around, or by others formed contrary to the usual ana- tomical order. In general all ganglions are deeply seated; though unprovided with a bony covering analo- gous to that of the brain, they are not the less de- fended against the action of external bodies. It is this deep position which places them without the reach of our experiments ; from such, at least, as may require that the animal should survive the

CELLULAR SYSTEM* 23 or fibre, or nervous filament, every portion of fascia or ligament, every glandular particle, &c. are enclosed in a sheath and peculiar cellular texture, which, in respect to these parts, fulfils the same purpose as the larger envelope we have mentioned does in respect to the whole organ. Thus, the life of each fibre is insulated by this membrane, which, like that of the entire organ, forms round it a kind of atmosphere calculated to secure and protect it, and may be notwithstand- ing accessory, like the general membrane, and even more so, on account of the closer juxta- position, to the communicating diseases from one fibre to another. The motion of each of these fibres is astonishingly promoted by the cellular membrane : accordingly, these organs which, like muscles, have an apparent motion in their several parts, abstractedly considered, possess much more within than those which, like tendons, ligaments, glands, have no sensible motion but that which is communicated to them. The cellular tissue lining each organ, assumes but little of the character of vitality which dis- tinguishes the organ ; it preserves almost all its general properties; it is in the structure of the different parts a material that unites the others without assimilating them. It is void of sensibility in the nerve, of contractility in the muscle, and has no concern with secretion in the gland. Thus it is frequently affected without deranging the

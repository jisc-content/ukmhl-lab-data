OF ANIMAL LIFE. 197 the external sensations, without the nervous in- fluence intermediate to the brain, and the part which receives the impression. To prove this assertion, let us examine the functions that de- pend upon organic sensibility. They are, 1st. circulation in the capillary system ; 2dly, secre- tion ; 3dly, exhalation ; 4thly, absorption ; 5thly, nutrition. In all the phenomena of these func- tions, the fluids produce upon the solids an im- pression with which we are not familiar, and in vir- tue of which these solids re-act. It is through the means of organic sensibility that solids receive the impression ; it is through insensible contractility they re-act: then, in none of these cases do the nerves appear to take an active part. 1st. Capillary circulation is carried on in car- tilages, tendons, ligaments, &c. where the nerves of animal life do not enter. Inflammation, which is nothing else but a defect, an exaltation in this capillary circulation, takes place in these organs as in those that are more essentially provided with nerves. Nay, where nerves are more abun- dant, this affection is not frequently met with : of this the muscles are an example. The tongue, whose surface receives nerves four or five fold more than the same extent of a mucous mem- brane, is not so liable to inflammation as the other parts of that system. The retina that is entirely nervous, is seldom inflamed. Nothing, as I have stated, is more rare than inflammation of the

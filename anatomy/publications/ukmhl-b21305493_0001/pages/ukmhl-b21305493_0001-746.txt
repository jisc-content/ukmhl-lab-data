604 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. blood has appeared to me every where nearly the same. I was anxious to ascertain whether that returned from an inflamed part was more or less dark, and I have consequently made several inci- sions close to each other in the posterior limb of a dog, and left them exposed to the air : after three days the inflammation being apparently at its height, I have opened the saphenae, and the crural veins above, both in the diseased and in the sound limb, in order to compare the blood, but could perceive no difference. A short time ago, I caused a man to be bled who had a whitlow, attended with an inflammatory abscess extending over the hand and the lower part of the fore arm : the blood appeared to me of the natu- ral colour; but as the veins also return the blood from the sound parts, this would require more accurate investigation. One object that should be ascertained with ac- curacy, is the change that takes place in general diseases in the deep colour of the blood, and the symptoms with which particular alterations coin- cide. Our investigations have hitherto been re- stricted to ascertaining, that in some cases it is darker, and lighter in others.

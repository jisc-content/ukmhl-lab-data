ABSOKBANT SYSTEM. 722 Difference of the Vital Properties in the Absorbents and their Glands. Although at the same time we have treated of the vital properties in the glands, and in the ab- sorbentsâ€”although anatomy represents the former as an assemblage of numerous vascular folds and windings, yet it cannot be doubted that they are possessed of a peculiar mode of vitality, which distinguishes them from the absorbents that resort to them. It is this peculiar mode that makes them liable to certain diseases that are not so in the absorbents : scrofula seems to affect them in particular. In the innumerable cases of ob- structions which arise after organic diseases of these organs, the tissue of the absorbents does not appear simultaneously injured. It even appears that in a number of cases, the numerous windings of their tubes in the glands are not organically affected; in fact they transmit the lymph as usual. Nothing is more common than to find the abdominal and thoracic obstructions of these glands unattended, in infants, with serous infiltrations, even in their most advanced periods. I have fre- quently been struck with this phenomenon in dis- secting young subjects. The lymphatic vessels are apparently not more than usually dilated. It rarely happens that at this stage of life we can discover them for the purpose of injection.

734 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. SECTION III. Motion of the Fluids in the Absorbents. When once absorbed from the different surfaces we have mentioned, the fluids move successively till they reach the common trunks that transmit them to the veinous system. We are ignorant of the laws of this motion. It is evident, however, from several observations previously adduced, that it bears a striking analogy to that of the veinous system, but it is also dis- tinguished from this by a variety of differences. In general it appears slower in its progress. The thoracic duct, if opened when filled with chyle, does not emit so large a stream as that from a vein. The motion of the lymph does not appear like that in veins, to be liable to a reflux on approach- ing the heart; for instance, the venae cavae, and jugular veins, &c. may be so much the more di- lated, that the lungs, obstructed more than usual, oppose a greater obstacle to the blood, which retrogrades. Now I have never observed in in- jecting the thoracic duct between its dilatation and contraction, and the state of the pulmonary or- gan, the least contraction. <)n the other hand,

At that stage, the blood of the umbilical vein, and that of the vena porta, or a great part of them, are evidently united in the common trunk. Are these fluids of a similar nature ? Experiments have proved nothing in this respect. But Bau- dalocque has told me, he had frequently observed that the fluid of the umbilical vein is redder; that this fluid even approaches the arterial blood. I have not strictly observed this fact in any other animal than in the young Guinea pig, in which the transparency of the cord does not exhibit any material difference between the blood of the arteries and that of the umbilical vein ; but this distinction may be more striking in man. Now, in this case, the blood of the umbilical vein seems to acquire this reddish hue in the liver, for most undoubtedly it is uniform in the circulation of the foetus beyond this organ, as I have frequently ascertained. At the time of birth, the biood ceasing to flow through the umbilical vein, the liver is no more then than the boundary of the dark abdominal bloody a kind of revolution then takes place in this viscus. The different canals that conveyed to it the blood of the umbilical vein do not close,

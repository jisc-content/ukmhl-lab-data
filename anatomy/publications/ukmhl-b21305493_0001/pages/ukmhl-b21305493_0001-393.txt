Why has not nature provided the nerves of the extremities with gan- glions, as well as those of other parts ? 5thly, If a ganglion be nothing more than the re-solution of a nerve into very diminutive filaments, why is there never any proportion between the filaments that enter into it on one side, and those which pass out on the other ? In fact, those which pene- trate the superior cervical from above, have no other office than to expand their filaments in this ganglion, and then to re-unite them to form those which project from the lower part. There should undoubtedly be some equality of volume between the one and the other; every ganglion should exhibit this constant connection between the nerves on one side, and those on the other; but, inspection will suffice to prove in almost every one of these organs, a disposition quite the reverse; 6thly. Ganglions ought, in every in- stance, to be proportioned to the size of the nerves that form them, by the expansion of their filaments. Why then, are the intercostal gan- glions so small, and the trunks that unite them, or rather, by which they are formed, and project again according to the admitted opinion,â€”why are these, I say, so large ? Why, on the other hand, is the superior cervical ganglion so large, A A 2

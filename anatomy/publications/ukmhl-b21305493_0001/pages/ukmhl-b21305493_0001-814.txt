672 EXHALANT SYSTEM. saliva, semen, <&c. whilst it is frequently the case in respect to serum, as in incysted dropsies, to fat, as in steatomatous and other tumours presenting a greasy substance similar to that fluid, or to synovia, as in the ganglions, whenever they are not synovial dilatations, but present cysts accidentally produced, &c. From whence proceeds this difference ? The reason is, because, that the secreted fluids should be thus accident- ally separated from the blood, it would be re- quisite that glands should be also accidentally formed in the body. Now the structure of these organs is too complicated, their organiza- tion admits of too many conditions for this de- velopement to take place. The simple organiza- tion, on the contrary, of the exhalant surfaces in which there are merely vessels continuous with the arteries, without any intermediate organ, require much less labour to be thus accidentally produced in parts in which they were unknown before. Sometimes the preternatural fluids are not col- lected in a cyst, they always flow externally : such is the case with fistulas and other natural or ar- tificial issues. Then the cellular tissue always pre- serving the accidental modification of sensibility produced in a part by an abscess or any other cause, still continues to pour a fluid different from that exhaled in the natural state.

OF ANIMAL LIFE. 221 membranes that infold it are indebted to this substance only for their early extension. One might be induced to say, that nature, in thus creating first the heart and the brain, and in causing their developement to precede that of the other organs, intended to form a basis for the or- ganization of two lives; for in one instance it is the brain that is the centre of animal life : to this centre all sensations are referred ; from this viscus all voluntary motions proceed. On the other hand, in propelling blood towards all the organs, the heart evidently presides over circula- tion, the secretions, exhalations, nutrition, &c., which in their mass compose organic life. When once these two essential bases have been laid na- ture begins to build, or rather to develope around her, the double organic edifice, which, on the one part, must enable the animal to communicate with external bodies; and, on the other, provide it with nutritive substance. Notwithstanding this early developement, the brain is not, as the heart, in a state of permanent activity ; its two essential functions, in respect to sensation and motion, hardly exist. For this reason the intellectual functions are so very ob- scure, that it is still a doubt if they have really commenced ; the brain may then be considered, in some measure, as in expectation of the event, it does not act; it requires to be excited by ex- ternal bodies. I do not, however, mean to say,

It appears then, that in both states of health and disease, albumen is one of the essential principles of the fluid of cellular tissue. I have extracted a considerable quantity of this tissue of the scro- tum from different subjects, separating it from fat, and I have boiled it with an equal propor- tion of tendinous matter; at the instant of boiling, a white froth has risen to the surface of the water, but in the vessel which contained some prepa- rations of minutely dissected tendons, very little appeared. Is the cellular fluid of the same nature as the lymph, which circulates in the absorbents ? There is no doubt that this species of vessels reabsorbs the fluid from the cells, but other substances may pos- / sibly be mingled with it, and especially those produced by nutrition, which changes its nature. We can ascertain nothing by chemical analysis on this head. SECTION III. Of Cellvlar Fat. Fat is the other fluid contained in the cellular tissue. Natural proportions of Fat. Fat is verv abundant under the skin, about V

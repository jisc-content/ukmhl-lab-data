CAPILLARY S.Y STUMS. 588 cannot be doubted. Let their duration and sta- bility in the bones be compared with their rapi- dity and mobility in muscles, or rather in fibrous bodies, affected with rheumatism. The effects of inflammations are as variable as their nature; if resolution do not ensue, each has its peculiar mode of suppuration. Let us only compare together the pus in erysipelas, that of phlegmon, the milky or slimy humour of the serous membrane, the whitish or greyish matter of the consistency of mucus, proceeding from that membrane subsequent to catarrhs, the dark sanies flowing from bones in a state of suppura- tion, &c. &c., we shall find that some organs do not suppurate as fibrous bodies. When gangrene has taken place, it is every where the same, since it only consists in the ab- sence of life, and all dead organs have the same properties. But according to the degree of or- ganic sensibility each organ is possessed of, that organ is more or less inclined to be destroyed by inflammation in the midst of others that re- tain their vitality. Who is not aware that the carbuncle, which soon produces death of the parts where it exists, is confined to peculiar systems; that the bony, the cartilaginous, the nervous sys- tems, &c. are never affected with it, &c. ?

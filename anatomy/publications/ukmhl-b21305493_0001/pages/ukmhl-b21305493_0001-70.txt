We shall perceive them in the course of their manifestations, following the laws of nutrition and growth, affecting the nervous and vascular systems, more particularly in the infant, the pulmonary organs in youth, and the abdominal viscera in the adult. But we must proceed to other subjects. SECTION IV. of Vital Properties, and their Phenomena, ex- amined with respect to Solids and Fluids. Every organized body is a compound of fluids and solids. The former are materials on the one hand, and the residue of the latter on the other. 1st.

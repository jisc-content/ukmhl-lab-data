VASCULAR SYSTEM 344 Exhalants and Absorbents, Are arteries provided with exhalant vessels ?—• The circumstance of nutrition, without doubt, im- plies their existence ; but, as I have before stated, it is not probable that any open on their internal surface. In respect to absorbents, I once thought that the deficiency of blood in arteries, after death, proceeded from their lymphatic vessels, which still retaining for some time the power of absorption, removed the serum, that is, sepa- rated it from the coagulated part; but later ex- periments have undeceived me. I have secured blood, water, the fluid of dropsical subjects, &c. between two ligatures, applied above and below, on the common carotid, which had been separated in such a manner as not to injure the vessels that might join it, but after a sufficient interval have never found any diminution in then fluid, absorp- tion, consequently, had not taken place. I must observe, in this respect, that the carotid, being unprovided with collaterals, is, on this account, the vessel best calculated for such experiments and for numerous others analogous to these. We are aware that the absorbents abound in such parts as are best supplied with the cellular texture, and that in general there are none in

367 OF THE RED BLOOD. the want of that property in the arteries. In fact, to be enabled to perform motion of itself, an organ must be endowed with a principle of mo- tion, that is to say, must possess one of the two evident vital contractilities, the organic, and the animal; for no other vital forces have been found to exist in the organs of the animal creation, and it cannot be said that nature has especially formed one intended for arteries. Grimand ad- mitted in these vessels a kind of active dilatation, that enabled them, according to his idea, to open of themselves, to receive the blood without the help of its impulsion. We shall find that both in the heart and in the organic muscles, this kind of motion may be correct to a certain degree. In this instance, however, it is quite a different thing, the heart will dilate of itself when it is empty, as is seen when taken from within the chest of a liv- ing animal, and then deprived of its contained fluid, because that organ has within itself the cause of its dilatation. In no instance whatever have I seen arteries thus submitted to an alternate mo- tion, when empty, but they have constantly been contracted. 2dly. If arteries were by their vital contraction enabled to produce pulsation, irregularity of mo- tion in aneurismal tumours would be unavoidable, since the arterial texture being in an un- natural state, must be deprived of part of its contractility, or this property must at least be

735 ABSORB ANT SYSTEM* this canal is never found so filled with lymph as a vein is with blood, when in the last moments the course of the fluids is impeded. How does it happen that in the reflux that forms the pulsation of the jugular veins, the blood does not enter either of the absorbent trunks ? The valves so disposed as to prevent the entrance of this, which in the natural state flows towards the heart, are evidently of no use here. This phenomenon can certainly be ascribed only to the connection between the orifice of these trunks and the dark blood, in the same manner as the orifice of the larynx, unconnected with external substances, rejects every fluid except air. Blood is never found in the thoracic duct. There is evidently in the veinous blood an un- interrupted motion from the capillary system up to the heart. It proceeds, as it were, from this system, to be directed to that organ. The motion of the lymph, on the contrary, is incessantly in- terrupted by the glands, each of which, as I have already stated, actually displays in respect to the vessels that cross them, a minute capillary sys- tem. On reaching each gland, the impulse of the motion is unavoidably changed. Now, as the state of these glands admits of numerous varie- ties, it will be easily conceived how the motion of fluids, circulating through the absorbant sys- tem, must necessarily admit of numerous varia- tions ; that this motion may be rapid in one part.

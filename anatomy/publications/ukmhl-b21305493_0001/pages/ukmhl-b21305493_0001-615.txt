473 OF THE DARK BLOOD. Operation of the re-active Substances on the Veinous Tissue. This tissue, in drying*, becomes rather yellow, remains supple, and bends in all directions; so that these veinous cords are, in this respect, fit for uses to which arteries in the same state are not adapted. This tissue putrefies quicker than that of the arteries, but less so than the others, and particu- larly the muscular. To ascertain this, I have submitted arterial trunks, and portions of intes- tines, or of thin muscular layers, to the action of damp air. The veinous tissue is less capable of resisting maceration than the arterial, and more than that of many other parts; the water, in which it has undergone this process separately, is less foetid than that in which an equal portion of muscular tissue has been macerated. The shrinking of the veinous fibres is remark- ably striking when immersed in boiling water, or in strongly concentrated acids. In these cases, they contract more than half their length, on which ac- count, they become more conspicuous, and are also rendered fitter for investigation ; I have frequent- ly profited by this state; their contraction also thickens the parieties of the vein. If, when in this state, they are placed in boiling water, or in VOL. I. p p

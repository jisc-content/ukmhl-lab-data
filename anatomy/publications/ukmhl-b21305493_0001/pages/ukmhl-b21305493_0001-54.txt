XIV GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. case, relaxant in another, refrigerant in a third, the same medicine has been alternately employed in different, nay, in directly opposite views; so true it is, that the mind of man ever wanders from its right course when misled by vague and uncer- tain opinions. There have been no general sys- tems in the materia medica; but this science has been alternately influenced by the prevailing theories of physic. From hence proceeds that in- definiteness and uncertainty which marks it even in the present day. It is an incoherent mass of incoherent opinions, and probably of all phy- siologic sciences, that in which the inconsistencies of the human mind are most glaring. What do I say ? It is not a science for a methodical and philosophic mind ; it is an incongruous combina- tion of erroneous ideas, observations often puerile, means at the best fallacious, and formulae as fantas- tically conceived as they are preposterously com- bined. It is said that the practice of combined physic has something repelling in it. I will say more : in those principles which connect it with the materia medica it is absolutely revolting to a rational mind. Let us expunge from our classes those medicines that have been closely watched and accurately ascertained, as evacuants, diuretics, sialogogues, anti-spamodics, &c. these, indeed, that act on any determined function, and what knowledge shall we be found to possess of the remaining functions? It is doubtless very difficult to class medicines

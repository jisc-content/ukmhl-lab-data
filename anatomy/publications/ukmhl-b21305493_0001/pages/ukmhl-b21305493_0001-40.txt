PREFACE. pathology, what proceeds from the one and what from the other ; to determine, therefore, in the most accurate and decisive manner which of the natural and morbid phenomena are regulated by those of animal life, and which are produced by those of organic ; and lastly, to point out when the animal sensibility and contractility, or where organic sensibility or contractilities, sensible or insensible, are called into action : sugIi is the general doctrine of this work. One glance will con- vince us that it is impossible to define the prodigious influence of vital properties in physiology, without considering them in the points of view I have represented them. It may be said that this manner of investigating them is still theory : to which I answerâ€”the doctrine that demonstrates the laws of g ravity, elasticity, and affinity, that proves them to be first principles of all the facts observed in physics, is in this case itself a theory. The relation of properties as causes, with pheno- mena as effects, is an axiom in philosophy, chemistry, astronomy, &c. it is in these days scarcely worth while to repeat; and if this work establishes the like axiom in the physi- ological sciences, it will have attained its end.

ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 684* because the contact of air, by contracting them, will soon conceal them from the sight. Besides, I do not believe, that during life in any instance whatever, the absorbents are as much distended by serum as they are by mer- cury, subsequent to injection. When, injections have completely succeeded, a very distinct plexus of vessels is seen over several parts. Nothing similar to this, on the contrary, is ever met with in living animals. However quickly the greatest part of the surfaces that cover the serous mem- branes may be examined, surfaces that can never be laid bare without an effusion of blood, nothing can be perceived, except occasionally a few small transparent striae, which soon disappear. If the absorbents were filled during life, as they are when injected from their transparency, contrasted with the surrounding parts, it would be impos- sible they should not be conspicuous. I had se- lected very large dogs, the better to ascertain the course of these vessels, and I believe that their size is at least doubled by injections. Capacity of the Absorbents in their Course. The capacity of these organs varies remarkably: in the dead body it absolutely depends upon the state of these vessels at the last moments. In two different subjects, similar both in stature and

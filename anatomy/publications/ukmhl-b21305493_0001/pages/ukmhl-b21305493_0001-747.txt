605 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. SECTION IX. The Capillary Vessels considered as the Source of Heat. Every one is acquainted with the innumerable theories set forth by certain physicians (mechanici- ans) respecting the production of animal heat. Mo- dern chemists, in proving the insufficiency of such theories, have substituted another, attended with no less difficulty. The lungs have been considered by these as the focus from whence heat proceeded; and the arteries as tubes that serve to convey it throughout the body. According to this the pro- duction of this important phenomenon belongs exclusively to the capillary system of the lungs. I believe, on the contrary, I have even professed, in my Lectures on Physiology, and also main- tained, before I commenced lecturing, that it takes place in the general capillary system. I will not stop here to refute the hypothesis of the chemist. When we place on one side all the phenomena belonging to animal heat, and this hy- pothesis on the other part, its insufficiency to ex- plain them is so very obvious, that I believe every regulated mind may perceive it without being di- rected. The following are these phenomena. 1st. Every living and organised being, either anL mal or vegetable, is endowed with a degree of temperature peculiar to itself.

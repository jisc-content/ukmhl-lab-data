OF THE RED BLOOD. '113 quently obstructs the fluid of the inferior venae cavee, which was proceeding to enter it: this flows into the right auricle. When, however, this auricle contracts to transmit the blood to its ventricle, in- stead of propelling it through the foramen ovale, it unavoidably forces the two valves against each other, and obliterates them. In examining with due attention the state of the heart in the foetus, it is evident that when the blood enters the left auricle through the pulmonary veins, the right through the venae cavae, and that the valves have crossed each other, it is impossible, either at the time of contraction or of dilatation, that the blood should pass through it. Although the foramen ovale still remains open after birth, the dark blood has ceased to flow through it,—I will say more,—that this foramen may remain free during the whole course of life. Several authors have produced instances of it. I have myself seen a great number, although the assertion may at first appear exaggerated. Now, by the very disposition of its two valves, it is impossible the blood should pass through. When the two auricles contract at the same time, the blood thus propelled inwardly by the auricles applies the valves together, and forms itself the obstacle. In the greater number of instances the adherence of the two valves crossed over each other, is remarkably slight; they are rather attached than continuous ; so that, by introducing

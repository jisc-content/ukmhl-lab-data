105 CELLULAR SYSTEM. tumours to point out those to the formation of which the cellular tissue contributes. We may then consider the cellular tissue as forming the' general basis, the parenchyma of nutrition of almost every excrescence; first it shoots and grows over the part where the tumour is to be formed, and afterwards incrusts itself with divers foreign subtances, the different nature of which constitutes the diversity of tumours. These phenomena are perfectly analogous to those of common nutrition. In effect, all organs resem- ble each other in their nutritive basis, their pa- renchyma of nutrition, which is vascular and cellular; they differ from each other in the nutri- tive substances that are deposited in this paren- chyma. In like manner all tumours are cellular. It is their common character. Their individual charac- ter is derived from the substances separated by the tissue accordingly to the morbid alterations of which it is the seat, modifying in various ways its vital powers, and placing it in connection with such and such substance. Thus, as it has already been stated, all internal cicatrices resemble each other in their first stage, presenting differences, in pro- portion as they become impregnated with the nutritive substance of the organ to which they From these principles it is obvious how very regular nature is in her operations, how an uni.

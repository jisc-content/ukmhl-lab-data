CELLULAR SYSTEM. 93 nomena: small florid excrescences spring up in the form of irregular tubercles unequally scattered over the surface of the wound ; they are not fleshy as the name they bear, (bourgeons charnus) owing no doubt to their colour, might seem to import. They are but small vesicles, full of a thick, and, as it were, unctuous substance, which is hither- to unknown, and ought to be submitted to chemi- cal analysis. The cells are so replete with this sub- stance, that if we inflate the tissue subjacent to a wound, either in the dead or living animal, the air cannot be made to penetrate the granulations. The whole mass of them will be raised from the surface, but not one undergoes that distension and increase of calibre which the cells do that are void of this substance. The granulations remain the same amid the general tumefaction of solids. I have repeatedly made trial of this experiment on ani- mals that I had expressly wounded for this pur- pose. Gradually as granulations complete their growth on a bare and exposed surface of cellular tissue, they are seen to unite, to adhere together, and constitute by their union a sort of provi- sionally membrane, which excludes the contact of air from the subjacent parts, while the true and permanent cicatrix is beginning to form. This provisionary membrane of wounds, this species of epidermis, which is furnished expressly for the protection of these parts during the process

Nay, if the diameter were the same, circulation could not take place ; in the same manner, if the size of the aorta were equal to that of the venae cavse and coronaries united together, and the fluid re- tained the same degree of rapidity, circulation could not exist. The union of the pulmonary veins forms a wider trunk than that of the aorta, which, however, trans- mits the whole quantity of blood conveyed to them. What is the reason ? Because the impulse given by the left ventricle, causes more fluid to flow through the aorta in a limited space of time, than through the four pulmonary veins. The follow- ing circumstances, 1st. The rapidity of the fluid. 2dly. The capacity of the cavities through which it flows, are then reversed in the two trees op- posed to each-other, each forming a vascular sys- tem. In that of the red blood, there is less ra- pidity, and more capacity, from the capillary sys- tem of the lungs to the heart; from this organ down to the general capillary system, there is, on the contrary, more rapidity and less capacity. In the system of the dark blood, the motion is more gentle, and the space is greater from the VOL. i. N N

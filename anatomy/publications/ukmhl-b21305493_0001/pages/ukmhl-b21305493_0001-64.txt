GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XXIV their sense is not accurately defined. Suppose, that in the physical sciences some vague and general terms had been invented, which cor- respond alone to the non-vital properties, and conveyed only general and indefinite ideas, if we were to introduce these words every where, if we did not mark what belongs to gravity, what to affinity, and what to elasticity, &c. we should never be understood. The same may be said in the physiological sciences. Our art is deeply in- debted to several physicians of Montpellier for having driven the Boerhaavian theories from the schools, and embraced the opposite ones of Stahl; but in their departure from the false track they were pursuing, they have chosen in turn such wild and tortuous paths, that I doubt much if they will ever find an outlet. Minds of an ordinary cast dwell in books on every isolated fact they contain; they do not grasp at once the sum and substance of the prin- ciples on which they are founded. The author himself often unconsciously follows the impulse that science has received at the epoch in which he writes; but it is this very impulse that arrests and absorbs a mind of superior endowments; so that the doctrines must be absolutely different in physiologi- cal and physical books. A different language is in some measure required, for the greatest part of the words which we transfer from the latter to the former are perpetually recalling ideas that

264< NERVOUS SYSTEM suddenly produced, it is like a muscle implanted in a tendon ; the best method to ascertain this distribution, is to divide in a longitudinal direc- tion the superior cervical ganglion and the cord it sends to the inferior one : the change of nature in both beconj.es then very conspicuous ; or if the ganglion must be conceived as the union of nu- merous filaments of nervous cords, the sudden change these threads undergo in proceeding from the cord to the nerve is readily ascertained. 4thly. The dense cellular coat which envelopes the ganglion extends along the origin of the nerve, and gives it in this part an additional de- gree of consistence. It must be carefully removed before we can arrive at the nerve: then, every filament is distinctly seen to proceed from the ganglion. After it has passed out, it is sometimes found in an insulated state, which is the case with the semi-lunar, the lombar, and the ophthalmic, whose extensions are extremely fine. Sometimes several of these filaments unite and form a cord, of which the two cervicals, the great and small splanchnic, &c., afford us instances. I have never been able, by boiling, maceration, or acids, to destroy the adherence of the nerve to the ganglion, in the same manner as the muscle is parted from the tendon, and this from the bone, &c.

VASCULAR SYSTEM 424 the bone hardly produces any blood, whilst it was so very abundant with the foetus: why the mu- cous surfaces fade, and muscles become tarnished, &c. Every anatomist is aware that injections are less perfect in proportion as the subject is more advanced in years; that in extreme old age, the trunks only will fill; that the fluid never penetrates into the ramifications. In small sub- jects it is quite the contrary; that even the coarsest injections will penetrate these vessels in such a manner, that dissection is attended with difficulty. I have dissected several old animals, when alive, and the small quantity of blood con- tained in the minute vessels, compared tq what is observed in those of the young subject, was very remarkable. The general position I have already set forth, namely, that solids tend progressively to predominate, is strictly correct; this oblitera- tion of the small vessels is remarkable even in the parieties of large arteries; it is observed in the dead body ; I have ascertained it in the living subject. The diminished quantity of the red blood in old age, relates particularly to nutrition, which in the infant is comparatively nothing. It may * also be remarked, that in addition to the absence of power in the motion that animates the blood, it is also the cause why there is so little excite- ments throughout the body in advanced age. In fact, circulation is not only intended to convey to

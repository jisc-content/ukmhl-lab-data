398 VASCULAR SYSTEM ovale, and of the ductus arteriosus, are disposed. This separation divides the vascular masses into two. In this respect the circulation of the blood in the foetus is performed as follows :â€” 1st. All the blood received by the trunk of the inferior vena cava, either from the ca- pillaries of the lower parts, from those of the abdomen, or from the placenta' by the um- bilical vein, instead of proceeding as in the adult to the right auricle, completely enters the left through the foramen ovale, whose superior orifice is so disposed, that no part can be mixed with the blood of the superior vena cava, so that, upon proper investigation, it is seen that it is actually with the left auricle that the inferior cava is continued. This is the reason why this auricle is proportionally as much dilated as the right, for if it only received the blood of the pulmonary veins, this supply being very sparing, it would be very much contracted. From this auricle the blood proceeds to the left ventricle, which transmits it to the aorta, from thence it enters the carotid and the sub- clavian divisions, aud these in turn impel the fluid through numerous ramifications in the ca- pillary vessels of the head and of the upper ex- tremities. <2dly. After having remained some time in this system, the blood returns through the various branches of the superior vena cava to the right

480 VASCULAR SYSTEM water, or fatty substances, &c. veins acquire an enormous size. In the living' subject we perceive the varicous dilatations, such as those of large trunks, which produce obstacles to the course of the blood in the lungs, whilst arteries in general cannot be distended to twice their diameter, with- out both their common and proper membranes being torn. Veins may exceed even five times their diameter, without giving way. We find, however, numerous instances of such accidents. Haller, in his important book, has quoted several. During pregnancy, then, rup- tures have been noticed in the veins of the inferior extremities, and instances are not wanting where that had taken place in the veins of the head, where there has been violent pain of that part. The vena cava, the jugular, and the sub- clavian veins have been suddenly ruptured, and produced death. We are well acquainted with the hemorrhage consequent to the rupture of the hemorrhoidal veins. &c. I believe that the ex- âœ“ cessive tenuity of the parieties of the cerebral veins, must frequently expose them to laceration in wounds on the head, when blows are inflicted on that part, &c. Undoubtedly, when the effu- sion is in the cavitv of the tunica arachnoida, it can proceed from no other source than from the veinous trunks, which, clothed with a fold of this membrane, crosses this cavity to proceed to the cerebral sinuses. Now, we know that this is not

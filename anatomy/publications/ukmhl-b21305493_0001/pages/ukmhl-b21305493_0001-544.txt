VASCULAR SYSTEM ‘102 to alter, and approaches more, as we shall see, to that of the infant. This first mechanism, however, still predomi- nates for some length of time; from whence it results, that during the greater part of the time the infant remains in the parent’s womb, it is the left ventricle that propels the blood to the supe- rior parts, whilst the inferior parts are supplied by the impulse of the right ventricle, but as the parieties of the first are evidently much thicker than those of the second, and as the heart is more distant from the lower than from the upper parts, these receive a more powerful impulse than the others. From thence, may be derived a new source of the difference between the two regions of the body ; from thence, the more ac- tive nutrition in the superior part; from thence, the degree of vital energy it continues to possess long after birth, and which exposes it, in the head particularly, to a much greater number of affec- tions than the inferior is liable to. The more we approach the moment of birth, the more will the pulmonary artery convey blood to the lungs, and the less will this fluid be admitted through the arterial canal, be- cause it is only gradually, as T have stated, that the whole mass contained in the body will, at the event of birth, flow through the lungs. Although prior to this it has undergone no change in this viscus, yet it has not circulated in

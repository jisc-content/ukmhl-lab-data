392 VASCULAR SYSTEM by injecting a very irritating fluid into arteries. These sympathetic motions are very easily distin- guished from those of pain in an animal struggling to extricate itself: they consist of violent tremors, or contractions, like those of tetanus. It is not necessary to say, that the carotids should never be selected for such experiments, because the irritation of the brain, from the direct application of the injected fluids, would produce convul- sions, as an immediate consequence, and not sympathetically. Besides, the experiment would instantly terminate in death, if the carotid were selected for that purpose. On the other hand, as arteries have no sensi- ble organic contractility, scarcely any animal sensibility and little tone, other organs would have little power to produce sympathies in this system through their influence, because to bring a vital property in play in any part whatever re- quires that this vital property should exist in that part, and even to a considerable degree. Thus the innumerable variations of the pulse, which are the produce of sympathies, are all essentially seated in the heart, and not in the arteries. Sym- pathies then cause the heart to contract and in- terupt its motion, as stimulants or sedatives when applied directly over this organ ; that is to say, by acting on its sensible organic contractility. When an aneurism is ruptured in a fit of passion, or in the act of coition, an instance of which I

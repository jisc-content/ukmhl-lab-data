CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 581 that binds the heart with all the parts, and has, in inflammation, nothing peculiar but the par- ticular modification it admits of. The afflux of blood is produced in inflammation in the same manner as it is on incision. In the latter case the divided point has been irritated, by the instrument; blood instantly flows from the surrounding parts, and issues through the wound. This afflux is so evidently a result of irritation, that in a slight cut scarcely any flows at the moment the integuments have been divided, be- cause little of that fluid only was contained in the divided part, but soon after irritation will pro- duce its effect, and the blood flows in a quantity quite disproportionate to the incision. When the alteration in organic sensibility that produces inflammation varies in intensity only, the inflammation itself differs only in degree. The nature of the alteration, however, is fre- quently different, being often a typhoid charac- ter superadded ; the heat of the part is less, the colour lighter, &c. Other modifications also are remarked, but they all proceed from the differences in the alterations of the organic sen- sibility ; at least, these alterations are always pri- mary. The influence of these alterations is not less striking when inflammation subsides, than when it is produced ; if organic sensibility has been in- creased to such a degree as to be exhausted as it were, then the solid dies, and the fluid being no

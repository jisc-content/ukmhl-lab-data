Vicq-d’Azyr had substituted another, which afforded but few advantages, insomuch as it disunites certain phenomena that are akin to each other, and converts properties, such as sen- sibility, irritability, &c. into functions. Since this author’s time several others have given the au- thority of their names to other divisions, which are not more methodical, and equally remote from the natural concatenation of vital phe- nomena. I have laboured as much as possible, in classify- ing functions, to follow the track that nature has marked out herself. In my work, on life and death, I laid the foundations of the classi- fication which I followed before I had published the present one. Aristotle, Buffon, &c. dis- cerned two orders of functions in man, one that connects him with the material world, and another that is subservient to his nourishment. Grimaud revived this idea, which is as sublime as it is true, in his lectures on physiology, and his notes concerning nutrition ; but in viewing it on too general a scale, he did not analyse it with minute precision; sensations and motions were all the external functions that he acknowledged. He did not hold the brain as the centre of such functions, and, above all, omitted to include the

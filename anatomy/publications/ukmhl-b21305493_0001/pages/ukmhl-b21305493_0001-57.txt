It is important to distinguish these two actions of medicines on animal sensibility; they are perfectly distinct from each other. 4thly. Medicines also exert a certain influence over animal contractility. Such as produce a strong stimulus externally, as blisters, friction, urtication, Sec. frequently restore that property when suspended by paralysis. All these sub- stances, which benumb the cerebral action, inter- cept its influence from the muscles of animal life ; when the muscles, therefore, are in a state of con- traction, these substances are real anti-spas- modics. In submitting these reflections to the public, I do not intend to offer a new plan of Materia Medica. The modus operandi of medicines is much too complicated for them to be reduced to a new system without ample consideration, which, I must confess, I have not yet given them. Besides, an inconvenience, common to all classifications, obtrudes itself here : the same medicine frequently acts on different vital properties. Emetics, in ex- citing the sensible organic contractility of the stomach, likewise excite the insensible contrac- tility of its mucous glands, and frequently the animal sensibility of its nervous system. The same observation is applicable to stimulants of c c2

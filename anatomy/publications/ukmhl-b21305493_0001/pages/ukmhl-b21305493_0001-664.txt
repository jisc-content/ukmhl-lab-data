It is then the same motion that is continued from the gastric viscera to the liver ; besides, with re- spect to this motion as well as the former, many difficulties must be removed. On reading what has been written respecting the motion of the ge- neral veinous blood, no judicious mind feels sa- tisfied. It cannot be denied that external agents in- terfere a good deal with this circulation as well as with the other. The habitual elevation and de- pression of the diaphragm, the corresponding motion of the abdominal parieties, the alternate dilatation and contraction of the hollow viscera of the abdomen, the continual locomotion of the small intestines, &c.; all these causes undoubtedly influence the motion of the dark blood of the ab- domen. I even believe that the deficiencv of a */ great part of these contribute as much as the per- pendicular position, in lessening the motion in the hemorrhoidal veins, and in producing varices in these parts. This influence,however, is not such asBoerhaave had thought, that circulation could not be per- formed without it. In fact, the abdomen of an animal being laid open, the blood is equally trans- mitted to the liver, and flows in the same manner from an open vessel; but after a short time a striking feebleness is seen even before the general circulation begins to be languid.

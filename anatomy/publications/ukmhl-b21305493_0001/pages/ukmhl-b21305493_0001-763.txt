621 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. The temperature, on the contrary, never exceeds that of the natural state of the body more than a few degrees. In cases even where on touching the parts we suppose a material difference, the thermometer shows that it is in fact but trifling. In concluding this chapter, I shall observe, that I have not attempted to decide in what manner caloric is produced in the capillary system, in what proportion it is evaporated, nor how far it is connected with the circulation of the dark and the red blood, &c., nothing of this can be sub- mitted to experiment. Let us be satisfied then, in our theories, with pointing out the general princi- ples, and particularly with tracing analogies be- tween functions, the nature of which is known, and those we are endeavouring to account for, by presenting a general outline ; but let us never hazard a strict explanation. It has been tried of late, to determine precisely what quantity of oxygen was absorbed, what was required to , produce the water of respiration, the quantity of carbonic acid gas produced, the caloric exhaled, &c. This accuracy would prove advantageous if it could be attained ; but not a single phenome- non in the living economy can admit of it in the explanations they give rise to: chemists, and those in pursuit of natural philosophy, accustomed to study the phenomena over which physical powers preside, have transferred their theoretical calculations to the laws of vitality; but it is no

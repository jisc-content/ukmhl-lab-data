In the foetus and in the infant a greater quantity of this fluid is observed ; hence in part proceeds the redness that characterizes the or- gans at that stage of life. It is not known whe- ther these glands are supplied with nerves, and if some of the numerous ramifications that pro- ceed from the ganglions in the adjacent parts, the mesentery particularly, penetrate their tissue: I have never traced any.

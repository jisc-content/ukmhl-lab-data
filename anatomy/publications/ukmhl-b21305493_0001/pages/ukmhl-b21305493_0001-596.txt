454 VASCULAR SYSTEM sent a real net-work, in which the communica- tions are so very numerous, that the course of a given branch cannot possibly be traced. Not- withstanding this, these two parts of the veinous system are frequently the seat of varices; few even are so often found dilated, on account of the difficulty the blood experiences in ascending con- trary to gravity. This leads us to a general consideration respect- ing the anastomosis of the veinous system; that is to say, to demonstrate how essential it is that such communications should be more frequent in this system than in the arterial. In fact, if we compare the course of the dark blood with that of the red, we shall find that it is liable to be affected by a greater variety of causes. The dark blood evidently obeys in particular cases the laws of gravity. 1st. When a person remains standing for some length of time, the veins swell, particularly after diseases, when strength is much reduced; this swelling will soon subside if the leg be bent; but will increase if it remain perpendicular. 2nd. In numerous instances, in which the strength is much reduced, circulation cannot be properly performed but when the legs are bent, or kept in an horizontal position. The influence of position over several tumours or ulcers, which affect these limbs, cannot be doubted. 3rd. We are aware, that the first effect of atti-

613 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. the modifications of the vital powers in each part. Tt is in consequence of this mode of heat, pe- culiar to each system, that in inflammation each conveys, as it were, a different sensation. Let us compare the sharp smarting heat of erysipelas to that sensation in the lungs, the peculiar obtuse pains, preceding organic affections, with the acute heat of the different inflammations, and if in different fevers we apply the hand to the skin, we shall find that each is almost characterized by a peculiar heat. These varieties in the nature of heat are only met with in animal forms; mine- rals afford only varieties of its intensity. From the principles above stated, we may form an idea not only of the local alterations of heat, but also of the general disturbance that takes place in its production, from a number of dis- eases, whether it be that this production has in- creased or diminished, or again, that it is irregu- lar, as in peculiar fevers; for instance, in pul- monary consumption, when the palm of the hand and the face are warmer than on other occasions, &c. Who is not aware that the extreme parts are frequently chilled, whilst the patient feels an intense heat inwardly ? The different changes in the powers of the capillary system are sufficient to produce different modifications of heat. The variations of heat, in fact, are as frequent in diseases as those of secretion and exhalation, and

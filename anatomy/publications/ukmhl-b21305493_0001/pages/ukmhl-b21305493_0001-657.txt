OF THE DARK BLOOD. 515 decrease, &c., and the firm tissue of that organ pro- tecting the vessels, the blood does not require the means of deviating from one part to another. Thus the two great divisions of the pulmonary artery and veins, which immediately plunge into the lungs where they are wholly imbedded, have communication. Thus, again, the branches of all the arteries and veins, contained in the internal parts of aviseus, are in general not provided with anastomosis. In the small branches of the abdo- minal tree they are very frequent. Along the course of the small intestines, arches exactly simi- lar to those of the mesenteric arteries are found; less numerous on the large intestines, they are still very apparent, as well as on the stomach; they are wanting in the branches, and in the trunks. In the system of dark blood in the abdomen, anastomosis is rendered indispensable by the frequent obstructions to which this fluid is liable; for it must be observed, this circulation, in respect to the abdominal parts, follows the same laws that regulate the motion in the other veins, that the power consequently, which causes circulation, is liable to yield to the slightest obstacle. Now, in the various motions of the small intes- tines, a fold, rather too strongly bent on the veins by the pressure of these organs filled with food, when laying on the back or on the sides, and the veins are situate on a resisting surface, this, and a number of similar causes, will obstruct

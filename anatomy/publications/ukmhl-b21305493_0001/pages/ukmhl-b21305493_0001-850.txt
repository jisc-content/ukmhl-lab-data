There are no parts, however, where this colour is more frequent than on approaching the lungs. Cruik- shank, to prove the passage of the lymphatics through the glands, asserts that he has found those adjoining the liver in jaundice, of a yel- lowish colour, in which it is probable that bile was absorbed. This remark, however, is of little importance, , since every part in the economy, without exception, is in this affection of the same colour, only it is more striking in the cellular parts.

During digestion at the time the lacteals transmit the chyle, those of the mesentery become nearly as white as that fluid, and when this is completed, they soon acquire their usual colour: a similar phenomenon is produced by filling the absorbents with mercury. Parts in Common. The structure of those parts common to the lymphatic glands is as follows:â€”they are inclosed

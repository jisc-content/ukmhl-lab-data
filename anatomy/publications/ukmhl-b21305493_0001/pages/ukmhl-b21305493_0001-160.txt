18 CELLULAR SYSTEM. quickly inflame them ; thus it happens, that when inflammation has lasted for some time, the whole surface is found diseased, though pains have only been referred to one spot. I am convinced that the cellular atmosphere of organs, is not only the medium of propagating diseases, but also of communicating the beneficial effects of medicines. Howt is it that in rheuma- / tism a blister applied to a distant part is found frequently ineffectual, whilst placed on the integu- ments covering the diseased muscle or tendon it will produce almost a sudden effect ? How is it that stimulating cataplasms applied to the scro- tum, frequently exert a decided influence over a diseased testicle, although there exists no vital connection between the skin and this gland ?â€” why again do many other substances, applied also to the skin, act powerfully on the subjacent parts ? Assuredly it is the cellular membrane that is the means of communication, as also in various applications made to the mucous membranes. Gar- gles are found useful in inflammation of the ton- sils, an emollient injection reduces that of the pe- ritoneum, &c. Thus these means are not directly applied to the diseased organ, but their effects are transmitted by the sub-mucous tissue. Notwith- standing the advantages of such applications, either on the surface or mucous membranes, their effects on organs of a different nature and such as are subjacent to these surfaces, have been too much

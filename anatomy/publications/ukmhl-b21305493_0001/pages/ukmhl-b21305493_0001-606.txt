VASCULAR SYSTEM 461 rial fibre. Is it muscular ? it does not seem irri- table, as I shall state; its appearance is not the same as that of the muscular fibres. I am inclined to believe it is possessed of a peculiar nature, es- sentially distinct from that of every other tissue, possessed of peculiar properties of vitality, and organization. I do not believe it capable of much motion. In other respects, however, we have but little information on this head, the veinous fibre, although infinitely more extensible than the arterial, is, however, capable of greater resistance; without lacerating, it will bear a much greater weight, as Wintringham has ascertained in his ex- periments. In the superficial veins, and those of the lower regions, this resistance is particularly striking. There are numerous varieties in the veinous fibre, according to the individuals in which it exists. In some these fibres are remarkably apparent: in others, they are so disseminated on the large trunks, as to be hardly perceptible; but then, they are always obvious in the branches, particularly in the superficial ones. There are parts in the veins, in w hich there are evidently neither external fibres, nor even exterior cellular texture; such especially are, the cerebral sinuses, which present the following disposition. When the jugular vein has reached its receptacle, it is divested of its peculiar tissue, and retains the common membrane only, and plunging into the lateral sinus lines it, and is extended below in

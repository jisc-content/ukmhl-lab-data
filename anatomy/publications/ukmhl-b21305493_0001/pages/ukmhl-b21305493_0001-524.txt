382 VASCULAR SYSTEM the capillary system, are three things that take place at the same moment. This simultaneous mo- tion is precisely similar to the stroke of the beam, which is felt at one end at the same time that it is communicated to the other. A very correct idea of circulation might be conceived, by ex- amining the mesenteric arteries through the pe- ritoneum ; when the abdomen of the animal has been laid open, they are seen simultaneously to rise and pulsate both at their origin and extre- mities. It is impossible ever to form a correct idea of the arterial motion, by considering the volume of blood spreading at each contraction in the arte- ries, and then arriving successively at the extre- mities. If we read every author on circulation, we shall find that no point has been so frequently and so extensively discussed as the course of the arterial blood, and yet none admits of more doubts and is more involved in darkness. Why is this? Because all have set out on a wrong principle, and all consequences are naturally incorrect when the principle itself is erroneous. It is not the stream of blood emitted from the ventricle at each contraction that is impelled into the capillary system, but that part of the fluid that was contiguous to this system at the time of contraction ; the same as in the syringe ; it is the part that rests in the extremity of the tube, and not that with which it is in contact, that is

128 NERVOUS SYSTEM They are very slightly attached to the corre- sponding cerebral portion, so much so, that they are always separated when the pia-mater is removed. Thus the greatest care is requisite not to tear from the brain any of those nerves in raising it from its bony receptacle. The adhesion is parti- cularly slight in respect to the pathetics, the motores communes, and the fascial nerves. One would even be led to suppose, if the case was but slightly considered, that they were only conti- guous. The spinal marrow gives birth to thirty or thirty-one pairs of nerves under the name of cer- vical, eight in number dorsal, twelve in number lumbar, five sacral, five or six and further to the nerve which returns to the scull to pass out again under the appellation of spinal. The characteris- tics of these nerves at their origin, are as follows : 1st, Like the preceding ones they are continuous with the medullary substance; 2nd, They form two cords, the one anterior, the other posterior. These two draw their origin by several filaments placed one over the other, most generally isolated and always very distinct from each other; 3rdly, The attachment of these nerves at their origin is much stronger than that of the preceding ones, a circumstance which depends upon a cause we shall shortly point out; 4th, The consistence of the spi- nal nerves is also very palpable in their canal. In consequence of what we have just mentioned, it is

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 37 and extravasations of urine have extended to the lower parts by such communications. We can fill the pelvis with air by inflating the inferior extremities, and particularly the intermuscular tissue. The cavity of the pelvis is covered ex- ternally with much cellular tissue, but more la- terally than posteriorly, and particularly at its anterior part, where the generative organs of either sex are furnished with a plentiful production of this substance, especially the labia and dartos. section nr. Cellular System of the Extremities. In both the superior a'nd inferior extremities, the quantity of cellular tissue gradually decreases from the upper to the lower parts. It is ex- tremely abundant in the neighbourhood of the two great articulations. The cavity of the axilla, to which the head of the os humeri cor- responds, and which is sufficiently capacious, is almost entirely filled with it. The flexure of the groin is plentifully supplied, although not in so great a proportion as the axilla. The arm and thigh have considerable spaces between their muscles which are occupied by this substance. We find much less, comparatively speaking, at the elbow than in the ham, in whose hollow a great quantity is lodged : an arrangement which is pre- cisely the reverse of that of the axilla compared vrith the groin. In the fore arm and leg where the muscles are more compact in their arrangement the

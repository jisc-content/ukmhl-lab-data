411 OF THE RED BLOOD. perienced by the foetus, from those which result from a kind of instinct, from a cause we are unac- quainted with. It'is my opinion that the act of respiration arises from these two causes, and more particularly from the latter. I shall now proceed to the mechanical pheno- mena respecting circulation. At the instant the lungs change to a red colour the dark blood re- ceived through the pulmonary arteries, they also claim in some measure the whole quantity of this fluid which still continued to flow through the arterial duct; this no longer transmits any thing to the aorta, which, in several instances, is still found more or less dilated; for we must observe, that at the moment of birth it is hardly ever completely obliterated. I have even noticed that its contraction at this time varies astonishingly. How then can it be accounted for, that blood circulates in it no longer ? By the very same reason that food is not received into the ductus choledocus, the lacteals, or the pancreas, although it crosses their orifices, undoubtedly because the peculiar sensibility of this canal repels the new veinous blood of the foetus, which is no longer conveyed from the placenta, because that part, coloured in the lungs, will no longer mix with it. It is certain that no mechanical reason can be produced for this change in circulation ; it really exists, howT- ever, and is evidentlv connected with the laws of L L 2

18.5 OF ANIMAL LIH'. Influence of the Nerves on the Animal Sensibility of all the Organs. After having considered animal sensibility in the nervous system itself, we must examine what part that system acts with this property, consi- dered in respect to every other organ, in which it is frequently the agent of transmission between the organ that receives the impression of sensation and the brain which perceives that impression; whenever, as in the preceding cases, any particu- lar point of the nervous system suffers, the por- tion that lays between the injury and the brain, still serves to convey impressions. Thus in ani- mal contractility, nerves are always the interme- diate agents between the brain, which is the prin- ciple of motion, and the muscle which performs it. The first mode of transmission is, however, attended with more difficulties than this, which, to be properly explained, requires that two kinds of sensations perceived by the interior sensitive principle, should be distinguished: 1st, The ex- ternal ; 2dly, The internal. The external sensations are of two orders : 1st, Those which are general ; 2dly, Those which are particular. General sensations, as we perceive, proceed from the touch ; they, bespeak the pre- sence of bodies that are in contact with the ex- ternal organs ; they convey the general impres- VOL, I. U

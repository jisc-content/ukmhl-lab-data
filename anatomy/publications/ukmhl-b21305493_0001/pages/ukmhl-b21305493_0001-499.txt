Contractility. > / Animal contractility is totally wanting in the arteries. In fact, it could only arise from a con- nection between these vessels and the brain, through the medium of the nerves. Now, 1st. Any irritation whatever produced in this last viscus, by causing convulsions in the organs submitted to the will, has no influence whatever upon the arteries. 2nd.

If the spinal marrow be laid bare, and irritated or com- pressed, the arteries will neither increase nor slacken their action ; whilst convulsions and palsies are produced in the voluntary muscles. 4th.

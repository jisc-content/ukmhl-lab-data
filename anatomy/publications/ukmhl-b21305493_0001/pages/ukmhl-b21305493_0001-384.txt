NERVOUS SYSTEM 242 I began to consider each ganglion as the special centre of a small nervous system, perfectly dif- ferent from the cerebral, and even distinct from the small nervous systems of the other ganglions. In considering the functions of the nerves pro- ceeding from these centres, I was still more con- vinced, that they in this respect belonged to the cerebral system. In fact, these nerves, as we shall perceive, have properties very distinct from the cerebral; they are not the agents of sensa- tion ; they are never connected with voluntary motion; they are only to be met with in the or- gans of internal life ; and this explains why they are found concentrated in the trunk, particularly in the breast and abdomen ; why scarcely any are found in the head, where almost every organ is dependant on animal life ; and why the extre- mities which belong exclusively to animal life are not provided with them. Distributed in almost every organ of interior life, the ganglions and their nerves must naturally par- take of its character ; this is, in fact, what is ob- served to be the case : 1st. They are not symmetri- cal. Thus the nerves, in every plexus of the abdo- men, in the cardiac plexuses, &c. are very irregular; 2dly. There are innumerable varieties in the form of these plexuses, and in that of the ganglions; scarcely two are arranged alike. Thus the plexus that is beneath the diaphragm is sometimes of a lenticular form, at other times it is triangular.

569 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. the injection is conveyed, filtrates into the cel- lular tissue ; then there is a continuity of tubes from the artery that has received the injection to the excretory and exhaling vessels, or to the vein that transmits the fluid. The communications in the capillary system account for the skin becoming livid in that part on which the corpse has rested for some length of time ; in the back for instance : they also explain why, in placing the subject with the head low, this part becomes gorged with fluid; why, on the contrary, by fixing in an upright posture the body of a person that has died from apoplexy or suffocation, the capillary system of the face is actually disgorged of the infiltrated blood ; why erysipelas can no longer be traced in the dead body, when the blood fixed, during life, in a part of the skin, is disseminated after death through- out the surrounding parts ; why every similar red- ness of the skin, and even of the serous sur- faces should disappear because the blood proceeds through the communications in the capillary sys- tem to the adjoining organs. During life, this fluid is retained by the tonic power in a particu- lar part ; after death, being subjected to the laws of gravity and to other physical causes, it soon, in consequence of the innumerable communica- tions existing in the general capillary system, dis- appears from the part in which it had accumu- lated.

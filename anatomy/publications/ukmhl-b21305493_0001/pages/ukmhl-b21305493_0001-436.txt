In general, there are a variety of distinctions between the phenomena that occur in the upper and those in the lower parts of the body. We shall find that the capillary system of the skin is much more susceptible of being penetrated by the blood than that of the inferior parts, which is proved in asphyxia, apoplexy, submersion in the different cutaneous eruptions, and even injections, w^hich in young* subjects darken the face more than the inferior parts of the body. Now, this difference is owing evidently to the relative position of these parts with the heart. We have no general considerations to bring forward here respecting the first tree and the impelling agent of the circulation of the red blood : in fact, those belonging to the lungs and heart will be examined in the descriptive anatomy. It is, then, the second or the arterial tree that at present more especially demands our attention. In this article, then, its origin, course, and termi- nation, will be successively considered. SECTION i. Origin of the Arteries. This article comprises the origin of the aorta in the left ventricle of the heart; of the trunks

276 NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ORGANIC LIFE. are found in a thousand different shapes in their various classes; on the contrary, the ganglions are constant. Even in those species in which the cerebral system is imperfect, that of the gan- glions, with respect to its organization, is fully de- veloped. In the greater part of insects, in worms, &c., and generally in those animals which are not provided with vertebrae, animal life decreases and is confined in a striking manner; then the brain and its nerves become less evident in pro- portion as this life is less perfect. In animals, on the contrary, organic life is fully developed ; the ganglions and their nerves are also very con- spicuous. I have been struck with this remark, on reading the researches of various authors, re- specting the anatomy of the lower classes of animals : Now, if ganglions were not the centres of certain important functions with which we are not yet acquainted, why should they be so unvariable in the animal organization ?

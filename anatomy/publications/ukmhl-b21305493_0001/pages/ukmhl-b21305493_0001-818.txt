676 ABSORB A NT SYSTEM. and regular manner, an essential distinction be- tween them and the preceding. The interior ab- sorptions incessantly acting, take up at the same time the same quantity of fluids ; their action ex- actly corresponds with that of the exhalants. It may be noticed, that there is a two-fold, and essen- tial difference between the external and internal absorptions; namely, that on one hand the first act upon fluids distinct from those deposited on their surfaces, and that on the other hand they are liable to variations and constant irregularities, whilst the others, on one part, always take up the fluids effused over their surfaces, and on the other, are incessantly and regularly performed, at least in the state of health. When treating of the mu- cous and cutaneous systems, I shall point out the cause of this important distinction. 3dly. In respect to the nutritive absorptions, we are not quite so familiar with them as with the preceding; but nutrition evidently demon- strates their presence. In this function, in fact, there are actually two motions, one of composi- tion, the other of decomposition ; each organ, each part of an organ, are no longer at a certain epoch formed with the same elements they were composed of previously. The ancients sup- posed, but the opinion was unsupported by posi- tive proofs, that the body was renewed every seven years. Whatever may be the epoch of this restoration, it cannot be disputed but it is habi-

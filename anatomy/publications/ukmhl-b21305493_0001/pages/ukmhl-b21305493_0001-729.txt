CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 587 Inflammation, on the contrary, is seldom met with in the muscular, bony, cartilaginous, fibrous, arterial, and veinous systems, &c. where there are but few capillary vessels, and in which organic sensibility, presiding solely over nutrition, must unavoidably exist in a less degree. As the capillary tubes form also an integral part of the systems in which they are situate, and every system is possessed of its peculiar mode of organic sensibility, it is evident, that their respec- tive sensibilities must partake of this mode, and as it is on this property all the phenomena of inflammation revolve, they must in each system present quite a different aspect. Of this we shall have frequent opportunities of convinc- ing ourselves when viewing each system ; at pre- sent, it will be sufficient to trace the general out- lines of this essential point on which authors have not insisted. Let us begin with the systems that are most liable to inflammation ; we shall find, that phlegmon is the inflammatory mode of the cel- lular, erysipelas of the dermoidal, and catarrh of the mucous system. We have not yet adopted a general denomination to express that of the serous membranes, yet we are fully aware how much it differs from the others. In systems that are seldom affected with inflam- mation, it is by no means so well known as in the preceding; but that there is an essential difference Y Y 2

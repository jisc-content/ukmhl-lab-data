OF THE DAUK BLOOD. 467 tied it will not break, unless the constriction has been very considerable ; it is nearly as supple as the cellular tunic, a circumstance that renders it more easy to dissect than the common membrane of arteries. 2dly. It appears much thinner than the latter ; a proof of which is presented by the valves, which are so thin, that when pressed against the inter- nal surface of the vein, they frequently escape notice. 3dly. This common membrane is never found ossified in the aged subject, as is the case with the arteries; its organization seems not to admit of its being impregnated with calcareous phosphates. Whenever this occurs it is an unnatural state, whilst the ossification of the common membrane of the red blood is in old age, as I have said before, a natural consequence. This difference between the two common membranes of the red blood and the dark blood, gives to the diseases of the heart a distinctive character. Ossification is ne- ver seen in the tricuspid valves, nor in the sig- moid valves of the pulmonary artery, whilst it is so very frequent in the left side. This is the con- stant result of observations made in the Hospital de la Charite; and the dissections of aged sub- jects have invariably afforded me similar results. The pulmonary artery, although analogous to the aorta in its proper membrane, is never the seat of such ossifications, because its common

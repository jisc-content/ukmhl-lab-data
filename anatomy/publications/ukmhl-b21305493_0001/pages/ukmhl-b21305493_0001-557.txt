OF THE RED BLOOD. 415 llxlOs < the u refer repel urine iirthe venereal organs ? It has been the fault of all authors to seek only for mechanical causes in the phenomena of circula- tion. Undoubtedly, the course of the blood is a mechanical phenomenon, but the laws that govern it are vital: it is like a bone moved by muscular contraction; the effect is produced by the me- chanism of the lever, but the cause is vital. The blood having ceased to flow through the arterial duct, this soon diminishes from the contrac- tility of its texture ; it becomes a kind of ligament, that maintains the aorta and pulmonary arteries in their respective positions. In regard to the obliteration of the foramen ovale, it is not governed by this property ; it is not produced by contraction, but by an actual agglutination of the two valves, between which, at the time of birth, it is obliquely situate. This agglutination seems to proceed from the contrary pressure of the blood contained in each auricle, on the partition common to both. In fact, the fibres of the auricle are so disposed as to contract from without. Now, by this contraction, the blood on each side is pressed against this parti- tion, and, consequently, the two valves against each other. Besides this agglutination may always exist, whilst the contractility of texture, never failing to act when the parts it animates have ceased to be distended, the arterial duct is constantly obliterated.

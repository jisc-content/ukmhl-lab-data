43 CELLULAR SYSTEM. its cells, but also through the pores which con- stitute a necessary part of it as well as the solids; hence the transudation we observe from the integu- ments of the back, in bodies that have remained a long time on that part; hence also the oozing out of bile, which escapes through the tissue that separates the gall bladder from the duode- num, and deeply colours this intestine, &c. &c., but these phenomena have no connexion with such as are exhibited in the living subject. SECTION II. Of the Serum of Cellular Tissue. The first of the two fluids in this system, seems to be perfectly the same as that which is fur- nished elsewhere by the exhalants, and taken up again by the absorbents. The former deposit it in the organs, and the latter resume it. Ac- cordingly, when we expose a certain part of the cellular tissue in an animal recently slain, and preserving heat, to atmospheric air, condensed by cold, we observe a vapour to arise, which is occasioned by the dissolution of serum on its contact with air, a vapour perfectly analogous to the cloud that is produced from our lungs and skins in winter, or that which arises from - an aqueous flnid ot a high temperature, and ex- haled from a large surface, on its exposure to

166 NERVOUS SYSTEM they have no occasion for a peculiar texture, be- cause I shall prove hereafter that this sense does not require a peculiar mode of animal sensibility, but that this general property suffices, since it is from the mechanical shape of the hand that its precision particularly depends. With regard to the nerves that proceed to the voluntary muscles, as these are every where analogous, and fulfil si- milar functions ; I believe there exists no distinc- tion in their medullary substances. But in the par vagum, whose destination is so dissimilar, why should not the varieties of internal organisation coincide with those of the texture so remarkable on dissecting this nerve ? I might say as much in respect to several nerves which proceed to such parts whose sensibility is quite differently modified. Here then is a parallel between the cerebral pulp and the medullary substance of the nerves, and which may throw some light on their differences and their analogies. I have not gone through all the particulars of the chemical expe- riments hitherto made upon the brain. I have merely pointed out the phenomena of the effects that divers re-actives will create, phenomena that I have repeatedly verified myself. The medullary substance in the nerves is not distributed into filaments. It seems analogous to the white substance of the spinal marrow, which is a real pulp, stationary in the canal of the pia- mater, that serves to contain it. Besides, in the

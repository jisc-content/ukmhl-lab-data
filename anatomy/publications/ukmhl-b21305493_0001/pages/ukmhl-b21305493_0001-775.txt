633 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. Besides the diversity of symptoms this disease unfolds—a diversity I have already stated—evi- dently proves that the state of the solids and fluids is not the same. How is it, then, that the whole vascular mass in peculiar cases of phthisis, in which the lungs are reduced to half their usual size, flows through this organ ? I shall observe in this respect, that the large vessels contain less blood in proportion as the lungs are more ulcerated. The reduced state of this fluid, in respect to quantity, is very remarkable in many organic affections ; but more particularly, as Portal has observed, in this. If, in phthisis, the same quantity of blood were circulated as before, the circulation could not be continued, or there would be a constant re- flux towards the right auricle. We are aware that in this complaint the pulse is weak, feeble although frequent, particularly towards night ? Compare this pulsation with that in inflam- matory fever, in which plethora is evident, and they will prove to be quite reversed. I shall even state a general observation in this respect, which is, that whenever the powers are declining in our organs, vitality becomes lan- guid ; there is almost constantly a proportionate diminution of blood, so that allowing this fluid to be the resisting power opposed to that of the vessels, the proportion between this power and this resistance always remains the same —a due vol. i. 3 b

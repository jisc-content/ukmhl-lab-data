384 VASCULAR SYSTEM winding in a thousand directions, forming num- berless angles, asperities, and internal projections, &c. be adapted to it: If the tube and its branches are full at the moment the piston is pressed, the fluid will instantly project from this tube as per- fectly as if it had been straight and short. It is true that all those causes of opposition that might have some effect if the arteries were empty, at the moment the blood is conveyed into their canals cannot operate when in their or- dinary state, and that a number of judicious physiologists, who had even admitted of obstruc- tions in circulation, have found by their experi- ments that the motive was every where the same either in the ramifications or in the trunks. How is it theh that this did not undeceive them ? We are well aware that pulsation is the same in every part of the arterial systemâ€”but how could this coincide with obstructions ? The opinion re- specting the rapidity of the course of the red blood has retarded the progress of physiology with regard to circulation. This degree of rapi- dity cannot be properly ascertained, because the motion is not successive, because, correctly speak- ing, the blood does not flow ; it is abruptly pro- pelled by a general shock that evades all kind of calculation. Physicians have paid great attention to that mo- tion of the fluids in which, as in the stream of a ri-

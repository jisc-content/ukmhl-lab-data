Ossification seldom' takes place; however, there are some instances of it. The phenomena pre- sented by the effect of divers re-actives are pro- duced with much greater difficulty than in the adult subject, and particularly in the infant. Dis- solution, by means of alkalies, is a remarkable proof of this. It cannot be doubted, that this organic state of the brain at the approach of decrepitude has the greatest influence on the preceding phenome- na : to this, likewise, must be attributed the dull- ness of painful sensations at that age. A cancerous tumour in an elderly subject, perfectly analogous in its situation, its shape, volume, and nature, to that in an adult, does not cause the same degree of pain. Cancers in the womb, in the stomach, in the breast, &c., are striking instances. In the numerous experiments which I have made on living animals, I have constantly ascertained that the young ones, when sensible parts were divided, underwent the most acute pains; whilst the old ones, under similar circumstances, appeared to suffer much less. I cannot avoid making another observation in this respect: it is, that the breed in dogs seems in a certain degree to have some influence on the acuteness of their sensations. All the large species make but little noise, and z 2

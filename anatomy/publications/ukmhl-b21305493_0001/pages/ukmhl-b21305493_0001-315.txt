From this method of regarding the production of the nervous medullary substance, it is evident that it does not proceed from the brain, and that it is formed in every nerve by means of the neighbouring vessels. This explains why the inferior part of a divided nerve never withers; why a ligature, in intercepting the communica- tions with the brain, does not destroy nutrition in nerves; why, in the greater part of palsies, where the nervous system has ceased to cor- respond with that organ, it is still as usual sup- plied with nourishment. From this, and from several other considera- tions, Reil has regarded the nerves as enjoying an existence completely insulated, as separated bodies, communicating only, on one part, with the brain, on the other with the various organs. This assertion is correct, in respect to nutrition : as it relates to the functions it is partly erroneous, for most assuredly nerves are nothing but con- ductors ; it is from the brain that motions ema- nate, and to which sensations are conveyed. In white-blooded animals, and even in those in whi<^i the blood is red and cold, these functions cen- tered in man, and the approaching species in

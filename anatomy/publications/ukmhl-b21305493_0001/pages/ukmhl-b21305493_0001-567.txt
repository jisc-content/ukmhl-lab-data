OF THE RED BLOOD. 425 the different parts, the materials for secretion, ex- halation, nutrition, &c., we shall also perceive, that it maintains them in an habitual state of excitement by the shock it communicates, the source of which is evidently seated in the heart. Now this shock evidently proceeds: 1st* From the quantity of fluid. Sndly. From the degree of force with which it is propelled. In these re- spects, excitement must gradually decrease as age advances. All the functions of the child, either organic or animal, are characterized by a degree of vivacity, a kind of impetuosity, quite at variance with the slowness and want of energy attending every motion in old age. In proportion as age increases, the arterial texture becomes condensed, the lamina formed by the fibres becomes dryer, and barren even, if I may be allowed the expression. I have stated that the internal membrane is frequently the seat of a peculiar ossification, which hardly ever influences circulation, unless it takes place in the origin of the aorta. Arteries do not dilate in old age; the arch of the aorta generally experiences a dilatation, which is more or less considerable, and which being al- ways affected without laceration of the fibres, naturally implies, that these fibres are possessed of extensibility: this undoubtedly depends upon the habitual and direct impulse of the blood, against the concavitv of the curve.

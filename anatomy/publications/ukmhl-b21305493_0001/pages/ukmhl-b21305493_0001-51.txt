general considerations. XI Physical properties, in addition to vital orga- nic properties, and animal vital properties, in animals. Man, and the neighbouring species, which are the peculiar objects of our researches, evidently then enjoy all the vital properties; some of which belong to his organic life, and others to his animal life. 1st. Organic sensibility, and insensible con- tractility, in the state of health, have evidently all the phenomena of capillary circulation, se- cretion, absorption, exhalation, and nutrition, under their influence, &c. Therefore, in examin- ing the functions, we must always bear these pro- perties in mind. In the state of disease, all phenomena denoting disorder of the functions, evidently arise from some injury done to these properties. Inflammation—formation of pus— scirrhus resolution — hemorrhage—preternatural increase or suppression of the secretions—increase of exhalation, as in dropsies—diminution, or to- tal suppression—as in adhesions, absorptions, de- ranged in a similar manner—imperfect nutrition in producing unnatural phenomena, as tumours, cysts, &c.: such is the series of morbid symptoms, that indicate a disordered and disturbed state in the two above properties. 2dly. Sensible organic contractility, which is not, like the preceding, separable from sensibility of the same nature, governs particularly in the

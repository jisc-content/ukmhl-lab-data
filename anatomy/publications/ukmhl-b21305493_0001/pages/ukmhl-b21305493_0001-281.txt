OF ANIMAL LIFE. 139 from the anastomoses, in which two nervous threads, projecting from opposite parts, are inter- mixed and indentified with each other, which is observed in those of the face, of the sub or- bitar, in those of the chin, &c. Trunks of the Nerves. After having thus communicated at their exit, the nerves separate from each other, and proceed to their respective organs. They form at first considerable trunks, which, in a course of greater or less extent, traverse the great cellular inter- stices. The form of these trunks is sometimes flattened, as in the sciatic, but more frequently it is rounded ; although this form does not influence the nervous action, since nerves which are na- turally round when flattened by a tumor fulfil their office as usual. In general, whenever it does not interfere with the object, nature makes choice of the rounded form for the organs of animals. I observe even in this respect, that these forms require a system generally diffused* and destined to fill up the spaces which must una- voidably result from the juxta-position of these circular organs. This system is the cellular. It would be much less necessary, if square surfaces were those our organs exhibit, because less space would be left between them. Nervous trunks differ in length.

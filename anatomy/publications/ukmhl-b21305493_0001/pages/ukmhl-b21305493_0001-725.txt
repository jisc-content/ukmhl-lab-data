583 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. It is only after this property has forsaken the part that the process of putrefaction is com- pleted ; but then its progress is very rapid, be- cause it had began during life. In the same man- ner will the bodies of those who have died from fever be more rapidly decomposed than such as have perished from other diseases, because putre- faction had actually begun before death. Inflammations that are attended with a livid hue, a slight degree of heat, prostration of powers in the part, and, finally, gangrene, are evidently very characteristic of adynamic fever, as phleg- mon is with regard to inflammatory fever, irri- tation in the gastric organs, called bilious dis- position, in respect to the meningo-gastric fe- ver, &c. I believe, that if local affections and fevers, generally speaking, were properly studied, a kind of fever, corresponding in its nature to some local affection, would always be met with. But let us return to inflammation. If this affection terminate in suppuration, it is evident there exists again a different change of organic sensibility to produce pus. In induration there is a similar phenomenon. When it termi- nates by re-solution, it is because this property has returned to its natural type. If all the pheno- mena of inflammation be accurately investigated in succession, we shall find, that in every instance a peculiar state of this property always precedes the changes that take place.

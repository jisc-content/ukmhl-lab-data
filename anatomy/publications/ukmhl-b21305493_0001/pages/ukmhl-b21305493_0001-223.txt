81 CELLULAR SYSTEM. is a uniform fact in long established cancers of the uterus and other organs. Contractility. The contractility of tissue is brought into ac- tion in the cellular system whenever its extension ceases. Thus in atrophy, after the dispersion of cedematous and other tumours, the shells shrink, and lose a great part of the capacity they had ac- quired,â€”in wounds too, that involve some portion of the cellular tissue with the skin, the edges do not unite, but a space is left between them owing to the contraction of its cells. The integuments of old people are remarkably flaccid and wrinkled, and especially when they are in any degree emaciated. The subjacent cellular tissue, in effect, loses its power of contraction ; the in- teguments are, therefore, detached from the soft parts and no longer adhere to them. In a young man, on the contrary, however emaciated, the skin continues firmly attached to the muscles, and retains its natural tension, owing to its being brought into close contact on all sides with the parts beneath; the muscles form the outer lines or prominences on different parts of the surface of the body. We must take care to distinguish these prominences which in the face form what is called thin features, from the wrinkles of the skin.

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 547 hence it follows, that this system is not merely intermediate to the arteries and the veins, but that organs of exhalation, secretion, &c. arise from it. It is this system also that gives rise to such vessels as are intended to convey the nutri- tive substance to all our organs; it should be re- garded as existing in parts where the arteries pe- netrate, as well as in those to which they do not extend. SECTION i. General Division of the Capillary Vessels. Since this system is not solely intended to unite the arteries with the veins, to convert the dark blood into red, it is evident that other fluids besides the blood must circulate through them ; this, in fact, is proved by observation. There are numerous parts in the animal economy in which white fluids are exclusively circulated. The hy- pothetical opinions of Boerhaave respecting white arteries, decreasing vessels, &c. are sufficiently known ; they are met with in every book. Here I shall only state what can be strictly demon- strated. That in the general capillary system there are parts in which the blood circulates, others where there are white or greyish fluids only, as may be ascertained by inspection, and requires no further proof. But what is the proportion of these fluids in the various organs?â€”such is the object of our researches. Now there are parts in the capil-

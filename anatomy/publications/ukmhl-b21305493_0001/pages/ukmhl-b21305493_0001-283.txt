OF ANIMAL LIFE. 141 In consequence of these divisions, the filaments that compose the cords of each nerve, and even these very cords, differ in length; the shortest separate first, then the intermediate ones; in short, the longest of all continue the whole ex- tent of the nerve, and terminate only with the same. The brachial and crural nerves present this distribution in a striking light. The nervous branches are most generally ac- companied with an artery or a vein, particularly in the extremities, for in the trunk there are some exceptions to this rule. In the neck, for in- stance, arteries will frequently form an angle with the nerve, instead of accompanying it in its course. In the head, several arterial branches are seen perfectly apart from those of the nerves. This circumstance is sufficient to make us attach less importance than some authors have required to this state of juxta-position, so frequent in the nervous and arterial systems; besides, if this juxta-position were so essential, it would appear in the smaller branches and filaments. But this is scarcely ever the case. section III. Termination of the Nerves, By this expression I imply the spot where each filament terminates, and not that only where the entire trunk ceases; so that the sciatic will termi-

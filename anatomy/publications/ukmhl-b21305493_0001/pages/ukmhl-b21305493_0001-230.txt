CELLULAR SYSTEM. 88 in the cellular system. In this respect it is far superior to the other organs with which it has been classed, as the fascia, tendons, cartilages, ligaments, &c.â€”organs that are remarkable for the obscurity of their vital powers and the in- ertness of their functions. The phenomena of inflammation, [for this reason, run their career with greater celerity in this system ; their course is very rapid when compared with that of the different tumours which attack the several sys- tems already described. Suppuration in this tissue takes place with a sud- denness of which few organs afford a parallel. We are all perfectly acquainted with the fluid which results from suppuration; its colour, consistence, and its external qualities, constitute a characte- ristic type, to which we refer the ideas that we conceive of pus ; so that, in fact, whatever does not resemble it, is generally held to be of ill quality, or is, in medical phraseology, called sanious. This opinion is decidedly incorrect. Undoubtedly pus which is discharged from a bone or a muscle, from the skin in erysipelas, from the mucous membranes in inflammation, is of a healthy nature whenever inflammation has passed regularly through its several stages, yet it is totally different from the pus that is secreted from the cellular tissue. As the latter is more frequently observed, particu- larly in cases of surgery, we have formed a

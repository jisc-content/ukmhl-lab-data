130 NEKVOUS SYSTEM of the tongue, one nostril, are not deprived of sen- sation, in the same manner as the muscles on one side have lest the faculty of moving. We do not become suddenly paralytic on one side in respect to sensation, as is the case in hermiplegia in respect to motion. Experiments cannot clear up this point, since we cannot so easily discover the alterations of sensibility as those of motion. How- ever, in compressing the brain of two dogs, and rendering them paralytic on one side, and then, shutting alternately one eye at a time, to see if they could distinguish objects, and presenting by turns ammonia or other spirituous emanations to each nostril, I have not observed in the first pro- perty an alteration corresponding to that of the second. In the sensitive organs of man a dis- cordance is frequently observed. One ear is more perfect than the other, one eye perceives objects at a greater distance than its companion, &c.; from thence proceeds the imperfection of hearing, from thence also proceeds a kind of strabismus, &c. ; but the cause of such discordances seem to rest in the organ itself, and to be perfectly inde- pendent of the brain. Besides, it does not appear that each hemi- sphere always corresponds in a necessary manner with the nerves of motion on the opposite side. In fact effusions or injuries of the cerebral sub- stance have often been noticed in the right side, without being attended with alterations in the

342 VASCULAR SYSTEM of cellular texture, nor, as I have previously men tioned, do they even contain any in their inter- stices, a distinctive character of all other systems. It cannot be discovered by the most minute dissection. Whenever the fibres are separated from each other, we observe they are only in juxta-position, or united together by diminutive elongations of the same nature. I have also related, although Haller has affirmed the con- trary, that the absence of cellular texture is like- wise ascertained between the proper membrane and that which is common to the arteries. I believe that this deficiency of cellular tex- ture essentially contributes to the kind of brittle- ness that so particularly distinguishes the arterial texture, and which, as I have observed, renders it amongst all animal textures the most unfit to resist the force of the ligature without breaking. To this circumstance must also be referred the difficulty, nay, even the impossibility of arterial dilatations, of formation of cysts by the arterial walls. Real aneurisms, as we are well aware, never exist. Whatever may be the size of these tumours, the two membranes of the artery give way, and the cellular tunic only is dilated. From thence the necessity of the peculiar structure that distinguishes the cellular texture situate round the arteries, and gives to it a degree of resistance which in most parts it does not possess. Authors have been amazed at those ruptures that distin-

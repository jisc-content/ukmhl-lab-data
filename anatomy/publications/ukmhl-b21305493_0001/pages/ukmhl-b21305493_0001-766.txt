624 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. where extended, the part through which the blood is circulated is much more confined than would appear at first sight. In the first place, a great number of vessels in this system contain fluids differing from the blood, and moved in a variety of directions. Besides, where they are especially filled with this fluid, as in the muscles, mucous surfaces, &c. a considerable part of it, particularly of its colouring substance, is in a combined state, and does not circulate. If in an animal a muscle be divided transversely, inspec- tion will evidently demonstrate this phenomenon, which, added to the preceding, instantly reduces more than half the mass of blood which at first appeared to circulate in the general capillary system. It is evident, however, there always remains more in this system than what is contained in that of the lungs, and to be convinced of this it is only requisite to divide the lungs of a living animal. Hence it is clear, that if the heart presided over the motion of the blood in the general system, that, if, consequently, all that it contained were propelled into the veins at each pulsation, the capillary vessels of the lungs would not be capa- ble of transmitting it; but an assigned quantity, and proportioned to what the lungs can receive, only, is always conveyed. The same thing oc- curs as when the veins are considerably dilated, they contain more blood, and yet a greater pro-

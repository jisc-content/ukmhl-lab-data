INHALANT SYSTEM. 644. If the injection be not carried too far, it will be restricted to the capillary system, but if it suc- ceed, it will shower from every quarter oh the surface where exhalation occurs in the natural state. This effusion perfectly resembles that pro- duced in the living subject by the tonic powers of the part; for, as I have before stated, if it transuded, infiltration would ensue in the ad- joining tissues, whilst from the syringe that con- veys the injection up to the exhaling vessels that pour the fluid, nothing except the arteries, the capillaries, and exhalants, are filled. Besides, whenever active hemorrhage takes place, the ca- pillary tubes, from which the exhalants arise, evidently, as I have before stated, contain more fluid than usual. From these considerations, and many others, that will be occasionally and successively brought forward in treating of this system, I am led to believe that the exhalants may be represented as arising from the capillary system, by means of which they are continued with the arteries that supply them with the materials for exhalation. But to undertake to ascertain the extent of these vessels, their form, how they act in the track they overrun, is evidently an impossibility ; here, indeed, imaginary descriptions would begin. Their orifices are not distinguished without the utmost difficulty. On the skin innumerable mi- nute pores, evidently proving a communication

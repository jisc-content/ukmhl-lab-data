VASCULAR SYSTI'.M 44 2 general capillary system to the heart; from this organ to the pulmonary capillary system, there is more rapidity and less space. Without these reverse dispositions, it is evident that circula- tion could not exist. In this respect, however, an essential remark ought to be made ; it is that the capacity of the four pulmonary veins taken together, far less ex- ceeds that of the aorta, than the two vena cava and the coronaries exceed in diameter the pulmo- nary artery. I account for this as follows :â€”On the one part as the pulmonary veins have to pass but a short distance, the impulse which the red blood has received from the capillary system of the lungs, is longer continued; on the other part, this fluid is not exposed to the numerous causes of de- lay to which the blood of the venae cava? and the coronaries is liable ; then the rapidity must be greater and the capacity less. If the lungs were situate in the pelvis, the pulmonary veins would undoubtedly be more spacious, because the blood, having a longer distance to overrun, its motion would be more retarded. . We may now easily conceive the cause of seve- ral circumstances that have given so much labour to a number of anatomists; namely, 1st. Why the sum total of the arteries proceeding from the aorta, is less in capacity than that of the veins resorting to the right auricle. 2dly. Why the four pulmonary veins also exceed, in diameter.

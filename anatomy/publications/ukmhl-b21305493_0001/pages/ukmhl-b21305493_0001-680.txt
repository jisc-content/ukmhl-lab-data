VASCULAR SYSTEM 5 38 centre, *where both arrive from opposite sides, and where they are confounded as it were in one common trunk. The two columns of blood they convey, do not directly meet their respective directions, forming a very remarkable angle. When the opening of the arterial duct is at- tentively examined in the common trunk of these two veins, it is found naturally open to the um- bilical fluid, and that the blood of the vena porta, on the contrary, cannot penetrate it: in fact, there is a small fold, in the form of a valve, though not so strongly marked as many others. This is nothing more than a kind of projection, situate between the end of the vena porta and the veinous canal, which reduces the opening of the latter to such a degree, as to become evidently narrower than the diameter of its canal. The blood flowing from the vena porta, and running along this fold, applies it against the opening, and forms an obstacle to itself; the fluid proceeding from the umbilical vein, on the contrary, falling perpendicularly upon this aperture, displaces the projection, and penetrates into the canal. From hence it follows that the veinous canal is evidently intended to convey into the vena cava the residue of the blood of the umbilical vein: I say the residue: in fact, as this vein is very large, and the canal small in proportion to its diameter, it is evident that the greatest part

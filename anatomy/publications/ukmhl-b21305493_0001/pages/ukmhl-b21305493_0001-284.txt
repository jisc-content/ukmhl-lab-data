nervous system 142 nate in the thigh, in the leg and foot, but not exclusively at the extremity of this last. In fact, in consequence of what I have already said, and of what I shall state hereafter, the re-union of the filaments into cords, and that of the cords into trunks, are nothing but a disposition which is unconnected with their functions, and every filament must be examined. From thence it fol- lows, that the filaments of a nerve have three distinct terminations. They proceed ; 1st, With other filaments of the same system ; 2dly, With those of the system of ganglions, from thence result anastomosis; 3dly, They are lost in the organs. Anastomosis with the same System. I have already observed how essential it is to distinguish real anastomosis from the conjunction of a cord which passes to a nerve more or less distant from that to which it belongs, and which merely joins the filaments of the latter, to form together the nervous cords. Thus there is no anastomosis in the plexus, in the union between the cord of the tympanum and the lingual nerve, &c. In the same manner, although the filaments of the different cords of a nerve fre- quently proceed from the one to the other, so as to give the nerve the texture of a real plexus, and not as anatomists pretend, a mere thread-like

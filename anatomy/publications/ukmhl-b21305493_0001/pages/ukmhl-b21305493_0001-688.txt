CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 546 capillary circulation. I shall first consider the general capillary system* and afterwards that of the lungs. ARTICLE I. General Capillary System. This system exists in every organ ; all* in fact* are composed of a considerable number of capil- lary vessels that cross* unite* separate, and ulti- mately re-unite, by communicating with each other in numberless different ^directions. The larger vessels of those amongst the arteries through which the blood is circulated by the influence of the heart, and those amongst the veins* corre- sponding with the former* do not actually inter- fere with the structure of our organs; they wind in their interstices* and are imbedded in the cellular tissue that separates their lobes; but the capillary tubes alone are essentially a part of these organs* so intimately combined with them as in reality to form a part of their tissues. It is in this respect the animal body might* in truth* be considered as an assemblage of blood vessels. From this first glance, it is evident that the extent of the general capillary system is immense, that it embraces the most minute divisions of our parts, that the smallest particle can hardly be conceived without including these vessels; from

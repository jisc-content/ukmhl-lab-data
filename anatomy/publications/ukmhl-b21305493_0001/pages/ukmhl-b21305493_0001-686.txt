CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. The two great vascular systems of the red and the dark blood arise from, and terminate, as we have previously stated, in capillary vessels, that form in the lungs, as well as in all the other parts, their respective limits, and in which the fluids are mutually changed. Hence, there are evidently two capillary systems, perfectly distinct and op- posed to each other; the one generally extended throughout the whole system, disseminated in every viscus, is that in which the red blood is transformed into black : the other exclusively restricted to the lungs, presents the reverse phe- nomenon ; in its divisions the dark blood is con- verted into red. The capillary vessels affording both an origin and a termination to the dark abdominal blood, are intermixed on both sides with those of the general capillary system, since in the abdomen

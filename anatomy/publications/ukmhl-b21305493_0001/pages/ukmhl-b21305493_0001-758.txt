CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 616 into the blood with the heterogeneous substances* supplies with materials that which is produced in the general capillary system. Now, the com- bined caloric is perfectly independent of tem- perature ; an equal quantity of sparks will flash from the flint in the coldest as well as the warm- est climate. The whole quantity of caloric combined with the red blood is not disengaged whilst this fluid passes through the general capillary system ; more remains in combination with the dark blood. Hence, in the first degree of asphyxia, and pre- vious to death, although from the interruption of respiration, the whole mass of blood transmitted by the arteries to the capillary system being black, heat is still continued for some time, even when the contact of the dark blood has sus- pended all the essential functions, such as those of the brain, of the muscles, of the heart, of the lungs, &c. It appears, that even then, the dark blood still experiences in the capillary system a kind of oscillation, by which some caloric is emitted. Thus it is, that subjects suffocated by charcoal, that have been hung, or have died from apoplexy, and animals killed by the air-pump, &c. still retain their heat for some time after death, as every medical man must have observed. This phenomenon, besides, is not peculiar to the case we are now considering. On opening bodies, in the Hotel Dieu, I have observed, that

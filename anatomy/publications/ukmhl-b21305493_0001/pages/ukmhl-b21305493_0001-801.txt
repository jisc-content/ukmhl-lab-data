659 EXIIALANT SYSTEM. from the bladder; those again, which in violent coughs arise from the bronchial surfaces; those which are seated in the stomach, when different poisons have been conveyed into this organ, &c.; let us only compare, I say, these different hemor- rhages, and many others similar, which I could enumerate with those produced spontaneously on the mucous surfaces; and we shall find, that neither their phenomena, nor their duration, have the least resemblance; that their suppression does not give rise to others; that they are com- pletely independent of any kind of sympa- thetic influence; that our passions, which so powerfully influence the rest, are in no way con- nected with their suppression, nor their produc- tion. From all these considerations, let us conclude, that all mucous discharges, either active or passive, are real exhalations. Hence we perceive, that between the former and inflammations, there is not such essential difference as would at first ap- pear. In the former case, in fact, there is an ac- cumulation of blood in the capillary system, then transudation of the fluid through the exhalants that are continuous with this system. In the lat- ter, the first phenomenon only exists. The symp- toms, the accidents, &c., are certainly quite dif- ferent, because the modifications of the organic sensibility are not the same, but the respective state of these minute vessels, and of the blood, are

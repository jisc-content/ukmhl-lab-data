OF THE DARK BLOOD. 539 of the blood penetrates the liver through the different ramifications that enter its substance. The vascular system of the abdomen is propor- tionally less developed in the foetus than at a later period, and consequently carries less blood to the liver: it is, in this respect, similar to the other veins; I have observed, however, that its deficiency in the liver is not proportionate with the surplus admitted in the adult, in respect to the umbilical vein. This organ then, in the foetus, is constantly impregnated with a greater quantity of fluid than at any other age; this explains why, 1st. The nutrition of this organ is so complete, and its volume so considerable: 2dly. Why,again, in proportion to its size, it is heavier than in the ensuing ages: odly. Why, when it is cut in slices, a greater quantity of blood comparatively flows from it; why, as I have stated it before, when the liver of a foetus cut in slices, has been dried, they are reduced to a small compass, although of the same thickness as those taken from the liver of an adult, or of an aged subject. The disproportion of the volume of the liver in the foetus is so much the more striking as it draws nearer to conception; it is the same as in respect to the brain, the nearer the foetus ap- proaches birth, the more this organ also ac- quires the proportions it will bear to the other organs in the adult. From Portalâ€™s observations, it is ascertained that this predominance of the t t 2

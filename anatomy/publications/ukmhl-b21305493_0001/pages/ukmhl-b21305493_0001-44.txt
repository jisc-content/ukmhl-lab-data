GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. IV It is only of late that these sciences have been thus considered. Every fact individually ob- served, was in some measure the subject of a particular hypothesis. Newton was one of the first who remarked that, however variable phy- sical phenomena were, they were all derived from a certain number of principles. These prin- ciples he analyzed; and proved, above all, that the power of attraction was one of the principal agents amongst them. Attracted by each other, and by their sun, planets describe their eter- nal curves. Attracted to the centre of our globe, water, air, stones, &c. move, or have a ten- dency to move towards it. Sublime was un- doubtedly that idea which has spontaneously laid the basis for all the physical sciences. Let us thank the immortal Newton, he first discovered the secret of the Creator ; namely, the simplicity of causes united with multiplicity of effects. The era of that great man was the proudest and most memorable in the annals of human understanding. From it we date the establish- ment of principles, whence facts have been de- duced as consequences. But that epoch so pecu- liarly remarkable for the progress of physical sciences, achieved nothing for physiology. What do I say ?â€”It retarded its course. From that time we heard of nothing but attraction and im- pulsion in vital phenomena. Of a bright and felicitous genius, Boerhaave suffered himself to be dazzled by a system that

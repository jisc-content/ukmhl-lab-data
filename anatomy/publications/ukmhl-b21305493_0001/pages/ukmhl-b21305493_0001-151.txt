9 cfllulak systkm. organs, whose obliteration would soon take place if in dropsy the sub-mucous tissue admitted of the same degree of distension as the sub-cuta- neous. u Is it to the difference of texture in these two portions of the cellular system in general, that we must attribute the greater frequency of phleg- mon observed in the latter than the former tissue, or does it proceed from the latter being less ex- posed to the action of surrounding bodies ? I should suppose both may contribute to it in like degree. I am disposed to ascribe it the more forcibly to the first, as the throat, which exceeds all other organs in the looseness of its sub-mucous tissue, (and particularly in the neighbourhood of the tonsils) presents the greatest degree of liability to phlegmonous inflammation. To con- clude, it is the firm and dense texture of this tis- sue that enables it to give at once origin and ter- mination to the numerous fleshy fibres which constitute the muscular coats of the stomach, bladder, and intestines, and to fulfil the same office with them that the tendons do with the muscles of animal life. Sub-serous Cellular Tissue. We find under almost every part of the serous system, as well as the two preceding tissues, a cellular layer, generally very abundant and very loose, as may easily be ascertained by examining vol i.

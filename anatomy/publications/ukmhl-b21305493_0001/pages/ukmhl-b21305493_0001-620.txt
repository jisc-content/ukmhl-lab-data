VASCULAU SYSTEM 478 pears to possess as many nerves as that intended for the red, which proves, that these organs do not influence contraction, since such contrac- tion is evidently weaker in the right side than in the left, whilst with the same proportion of nerves, an equal power should also exist. 3dly. The pulmonary artery displays but very few nerves. I am not yet perfectly acquainted with the con- nection existing on this side, between this vessel and the veins of the same description. From this general view, it follows that the system of the red blood is evidently provided with more nerves than that of the black. In fact, things being nearly equal in the heart, and the dif- ference being very striking between the branches of the aorta, and the veins that proceed to the right auricle, although the pulmonary artery, which I think rather probable, might be in some degrees better supplied than the corresponding veins, yet, the short distance these two species of vessels have to pass, would still leave an ob- vious disproportion.

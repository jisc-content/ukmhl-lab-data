From what has been previously stated, it is evident that the nerves which proceed from the ganglions are of two kinds, in respect to organi- zation : 1st. Those which are identified with the cerebral system, by their whitish colour, by the possibility of separating their trunks into distinct cords, and these into filaments, which like the preceding, appear to be provided with a nevri- . leme and a medullary substance ; Qdly. Are those which seem merely composed of diminutive fila- ments, insulated, of a reddish or greyish appear- ance, of a soft nature, and found in considerable numbers in the plexuses, provided with a theca and medullary substance?â€”it is impossible to decide. In organic nerves, it is difficult to ascertain the properties of the texture. In respect to the vital properties, it cannot be doubted but that animal sensibility in these nerves is not carried to such an extent as it is in those of animal life. I have frequently laid bare the abdominal plexus, then, by allowing the animal a few moments rest,

695 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. contained in the former flows through the latter. Now, if during the process of digestion, the thora- cic duct be examined in a dog, an investigation easily effected by opening suddenly the right part of the chest, and lifting up the lungs in that part, and by dividing the pleura in the course of the aorta, by which means that canal which, on ac- count of the chyle that circulates within, has a whitish appearance, is instantly perceived; if, I say, the thoracic duct be studied when in action, circulation will be found to take place nearly in the same manner as in veins. On dividing it then, a larger stream does not denote a more rapid motion than that of the dark blood. 2dly. It might be said, that during life, the tho- racic duct is sufficiently dilated to correspond with all the absorbents; but observation proves the very reverse. This canal, filled with chyle, is certainly rather more dilated than in the dead body, but I have ascertained that the difference is not very material. 3dly. By supposing that not- withstanding its very limited capacity, a consider- able quantity of fluids may flow through the tho- racic duct, the vena cava superior should be more dilated between this organ and the heart; however, it is nearly the same after the junction. 4thly. Heuson, by emptying the lymphatic vessels, has proved that the contained fluid is analogous to that of the serous surfaces: its transparency, which is not, however, a positive reason, when

31 CELLULAR SYSTEM. tremely loose, and secretes a fluid frequently of a reddish hue. The spine externally is clothed behind with a mass of muscle, but very little cellular tissue. Abscesses of this part are accordingly rare, and not so liable to produce sinuses as elsewhere, owing to the muscles attached to the processes of the vertebrae being closely compressed together, and the cellular tissue consequently which sepa- rate them from each other. This tissue, on the contrary, is very abundant along the anterior part of the spine, or in the neck where it accompanies the carotids, /in the trunk and abdomen where it attends the aorta, the large trunks which arise from it, the venae- cavae, et azygos, &c. There is no part in the animal ceconomy more frequently liable to sinuses than this is. We frequently see abscesses, that have formed at the anterior part of the thorax and abdomen, discharging themselves at the groin by means of those sinuses whose tract is exposed by dissection. It is chiefly by these cellular com- munications, and those that exist under the inte- guments, that the upper parts of the body corre- spond with the lower, and vice versa. 6 Cervical Cellular Tissue. The neck, which is furnished abundantly with muscles, contains a considerable proportion of

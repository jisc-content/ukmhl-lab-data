168 NERVOUS SYSTEM or sheaths. When a nerve has been inacerated for any space of time in diluted nitric acid, the cords separate from their sheaths, which is in respect to them individually what the layer we have just mentioned is to the whole nerve. Thick nerves frequently contain fat in their cellular canals ; in the sciatic it isalwaysbo be found. This explains why, on drying these organs, there is almost always, as I have observed, an oily exudation from their surfaces. Why, when dipt in any al- kaline lee, they become unctuous, and more evi- dently of a soapy nature ? Finally, new ramifications projecting from the cellular canals which enclose the cords, also surround the filaments with sheaths of a still smaller description. Here fat and serum are ne- ver produced, and the cellular membrane partly borrows that peculiar nature which characterises the sub-arterial, the sub-veinous tissues, &c. The theca or nevrileme is perhaps nothing more than this tissue rather more condensed: however, the cellular membrane unites so closely both of these, the cords of the nerves, and the filaments of the cords, that no motion whatsoever can take place. Blood Vessels. Every nerve receives its blood vessels from the neighbouring trunks, whose ramifications pene- trate them internally in every direction. The

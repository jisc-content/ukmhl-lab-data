CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 620 pends upon the propagation of heat, with which we are not yet perfectly acquainted. It may be asked, why, in the natural state, a certain quantity of caloric only is disengaged to produce an habitual temperature of so many de- grees by the thermometer ? I shall answer, by the very same cause that produces nearly a spe- cial number of pulsations in each second in the natural state, that makes the usual respiration to consist in a certain number of alternate elevations and depressions of the ribs, &c. &c. There are phenomena invariably united to the immutable order originally established, and which it is impossible to explain, only it appears that this immutable order depends upon the primitive type impressed upon the vital powers, a type which, when neither increased nor diminished, will continue to produce phenomena nearly uniform ; but as numberless causes may occasion them to vary, so will pulsation, respiration, caloric, &c., vary. I shall, however, observe, in respect to the latter, that these variations are more narrowly circumscribed than those of several other func- tions. If, for instance, we compare the usual quan- tity of fluids exhaled and secreted in the natural state with the increase it admits of in peculiar cases, the general state of the pulse with its ex- acerbation in numerous fevers, &c., we shall find that between the natural state and the contrary one there is frequently an astonishing difference.

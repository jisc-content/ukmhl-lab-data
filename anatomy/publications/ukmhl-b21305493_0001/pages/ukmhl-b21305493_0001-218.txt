The drying up of ulcers on the surface, de- pending, no doubt, on the action of the absorb- ents of Ihis system. In phthisis often, the sup- purating parts of the lungs are suddenly emptied of their contents, and after death, which quickly follows such a change, we see nothing more than the mere cavities which were filled with pus. I have lost two patients in the course of my practice, owing to this sudden absorption of mat- ter, which is precisely correspondent to that which takes place in superficial ulcerations. 6thly. We find the greatest number of absorbents where the abundance of cellular tissue is the greatest, as well as a larger proportion of follicles. In those parts where the tissue is most scanty, as for instance the brain, we observe the very fewest number of absorbents. The cellular system may be considered then as the main origin of the absorbents, and especially those that serve to convey lymph. These vessels, in union with the exhalants, appear to form the principal part of its texture. Some have the hardihood to assert that it is composed exclusively of them; but such a position has neither observation nor dissection for its grounds. We can distinguish a transparent and filamen- tous tissue, and nothing more. Each particular cell is an intermediate receptacle placed between the

In the brain and in the tuber an- nulare, it has no general rule; but in the series of the spinal nerves, that direction is almost perpen- dicular to thg medulla at the top of the cervical region,â€”becomes gradually more and more oblique to the end of the lumbar region. These three things, the length in the canal, thk thickness and oblique direction of the nerves of the spine, go on encreasing from top to the bottom, in a graduated manner, with some exceptions in respect to thick- ness. Each pair of nerves, in proceeding from the brain, from the protuberance and its appendages, and from the spinal marrow, diverge into the two trunks of which they are formed ; the olfac- tory only converge, and those of the spine ascend in a direction nearly parallel. SECTION II. Course of the Cerebral Nerves. In proceeding from the bony cavities which en- close their origin, the nerves exhibit different dis- positions.

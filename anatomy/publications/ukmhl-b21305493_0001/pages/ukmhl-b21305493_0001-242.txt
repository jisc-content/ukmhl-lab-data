100 CELLULAR SYSTEM. of remaining in the substance of the granulations, instead of penetrating, incrusting, and consoli- dating this substance, as the phosphate of lime and gluten penetrate and encompass the bones, !t is expelled as extraneous matter, and in nowise conducive to their union ; so that in the internal organs, first exhalation, and then consolidation, of the exhaled fluid takes place, and in the ex- ternal parts, exhalation and afterwards excretion of that fluid. To conclude, an internal wound that involves the cellular tissue and suppurates, seems to me perfectly analogous to the serous surfaces, which in consequence of inflammation are covered with a purulent exudation. The thin pellicle that lines the granulations, is of the same nature as the pleurae or peritoneum when inflamed, that is to say, essentially of a cellular nature. Pus in both cases is nearly the same, and resembles that in phlegmon, whereas if the skin only is affected, this fluid is totally dissimilar in its nature, as is observed in erysipelas. The exhalation of pus on the surface of a wound, and that of divided membranes, appears to me to hold considerable analogy with that of the white matter that is (con- tained in certain cysts. Fourth Stage. Suppuration exhausts by degrees the whitish substance that fills the granulations â€¢ their cells, at

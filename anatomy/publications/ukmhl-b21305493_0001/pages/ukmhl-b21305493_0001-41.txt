general anatomy. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. There are in nature two classes of beings, two classes of properties, and two classes of sciences. Beings are organic or inorganic, properties vital or non-vital, sciences, physiological, or physical. Animals and vegetables are organic. What are called minerals are inorganio. The vital proper- ties are sensibility and contractility. The non- vital are gravity, affinity, and elasticity. The physiological sciences are composed of animal physiology, vegetable physiology, and physic. The physical sciences are astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, &c. These two classes of sciences belong ex- clusively to phenomena. Two other classes corresponding to them embrace external and internal forms, and their description. Botany, anatomy, and zoology, constitute the sciences that treat of organic forms ; mineralogy, that which treats of inorganic forms. The first will occupy us particularly when we come to examine the connections of living bodies with one another, and those that are inanimate. b 2

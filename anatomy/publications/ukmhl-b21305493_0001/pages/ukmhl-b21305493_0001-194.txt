CELLULAR SYSTEM. 52 two fluids are in an inverse ratio to one another. We must conclude then, from the preceding facts, that if a moderate exhalation of fat denotes strength, its superabundance denotes weakness, and that there is in this respect, as I have already stated, a certain relation between se- rous and adipose infiltrations. We must remark nevertheless, that dropsies, almost invariably, pro- ceed from organic derangement of some viscus; especially the heart, lungs, liver, womb, and spleen, from whence it results that they are hardly ever subdued but usually terminate in death : which is the unavoidable consequence, not of dropsies, but the organic disease. On the con- trary, it rarely happens that superabundance of fat, which is not incompatible with longevity, is attended with such like change of structure. If there were no other change in dropsy but cellular weakness, I am convinced that it would not in- terfere with the regularity of the functions. Considerable collections of fat are frequently the immediate result of some outward cause of at- mospherical influence: for instance, thus a fog- will, in the space of twenty-four hours, fatten thrushes, ortolans, red breasts, &c. to such a degree, that they can scarcely fly from the sportsmanâ€™s gun. This phenomenon, which is not unfrequent in Autumn, is rarely apparent in man. The decrease of fat is as frequent as its increase,

4 04 VASCULAR SYSTEM nearly separated during the first months; the whole of the blood proceeding from the inferior vena cava passes the ascending aorta, and all that flows from the superior cava is thrown into the descend- ing part of that artery, the lungs receiving hardly any other supply for their nutrition than that of the bronchial arteries. But in proportion as we approach towards birth, these two species of blood begin to mix together, and circulation takes an intermediate course between that of the adult, and what takes place in the first months after conception. At the instant of birth, the foramen ovale and the arterial canal being considerably contracted, circulation is carried on in the womb of the mother nearly in the same manner as it is afterwards continued; the only difference exist- ing, is, that the fluid is of the same nature, be- cause respiration has not commenced. The sudden change of circulation at the instant of birth re- lates particularly to the introduction of the red blood in the economy. In respect to the me- chanical phenomena, they have been gradually brought on by the regular contraction of the two openings of communication. The blood has ceased by degrees to move from the inferior to the superior capillary vessels, and has been ac- customed to proceed reciprocally from both to those of the lungs. It would be difficult to account for the pheno-

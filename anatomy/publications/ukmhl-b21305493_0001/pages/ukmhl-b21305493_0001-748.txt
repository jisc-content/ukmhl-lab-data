CAPILLAIIY SYSTEMS. 606 2nd. In animals, this temperature is nearly the same at every stage of life. 3rd. It is completely independent of the tem- perature of the atmosphere, remaining the same in the midst of a warmer or a colder medium. 4th. In the state of health caloric is frequently more abundant in some parts than in others. 5th. In inflammation there is evidently more local heat. 6th. The vital powers, tone in particular, pos- sess a powerful influence upon the production of heat. 7th. Each organ is possessed of its peculiar degree of temperature, and it is from these that the general temperature results. 8th. There is often an immediate connection between the phenomena of respiration and circu- lation and those of the production of heat; at other times these connections do not exist. If under these phenomena we place the theory of Lavoisier, Crawford, &c., I do not believe we can bring them to coincide, and conceive how caloric, formed in the capillary system of the lungs, can possibly, as they have conceived, be extended throughout the animal economy. On the contrary, by admitting this fluid to arise in the general capillary system, the supposition is easy. But let us first lay down this mode of con- ceiving the production of animal heat. The blood receives from two principal sources

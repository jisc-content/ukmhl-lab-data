CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 618 stance. Such are phenomena, which, in common with those above stated, are evidently in opposi- tion with every theory that does not admit of calo- ric being produced in the general capillary system. Sympathies, as we know, have the greatest in- fluence upon the degree of heat. Accordingly as such or such a part is affected, more or less of this fluid is produced; in some syncopy is fre- quently attended with an icy coldness. Ulcera- tion in the lungs produces a burning sensation in the palm of the hand. In other affections, the head seems to be the active focus of heat. In fever, the patient often feels chilled in one part, and heated in another. How can this be ac- counted for ? the following lines will explain it: The affected organ acts sympathetically on the tonic powers of the part, these by increasing cause a greater production of caloric than in the natu- ral state : it is similar to what occurs in the sym- pathetic secretions and exhalations, whether the vital powers be increased, either by a direct sti- mulus, or by the sympathetic influence they re- ceive in a part, it is exactly the same in relation to the effect. This sympathetic increase of heat should be distinguished from such as are produced by an aberration of perception, as when we imagine that we feel excessive heat or cold in a part, and even experience a sensation perfectly similar to the natural one, although the part to which this

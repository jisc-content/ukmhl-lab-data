697 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. sufficiently correct. It appears to me, that this question might easily be decided by applying a liga- ture during digestion, to that part of the thoracic duct where it enters the jugular vein: we might find it at the lower part of the neck, where its whitish appearance would prevent a mistake, and no essential part would be injured. This experi- ment would cast a strong light on the general question respecting the absorbents. 2dly. Very liquid fluids injected into the meseraic vein, are diffused over the peritoneum; from this fact, it has been concluded, that the ab- sorbent s terminate in this vein : but as the veins terminate in the capillary system, and from this the exhalants arise, the injection by crossing its innumerable anastomoses might easily have found a passage that did not exist during life, but which from the laxity of the parts and the want of sen- sibility is open after death. 3dly. The compression of the superficial veins produces infiltration of the extremities, but as such compression operates at the same time upon the absorbents, no inference in regard to veinous absorption can be deduced. 4thly. Kaw and JBoerhaave having injected the intestinal canal with water, the fluid was found in the meseraic veins; but this experiment re- peatedly tried since, has never been attended with the same result. 3 f VOL.

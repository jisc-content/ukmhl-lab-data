418 VASCULAR SYSTEM quantity of blood; so that, as I have before stated, the two extreme stages of life, present, in respect to the fluids and solids, quite an oppo- site disposition. The former are so much the more abundant as we draw nearer to the moment of conception. The latter are gradually increased as age advances. The predominance of the sys- tem of the red blood is obvious, till the cessation of growth. The necessity of such predominance to distribute to all the parts the substances for their nutrition and increase, is easily conceived. In fact, in the adult, the arteries contain onlv what is intended for the first process; in the infant they convey also what is indispensable to the second. > This unavoidably requires that the calibre of the arteries should be proportionally larger than af- terwards, to contain a greater quantity of blood. It is, in fact, demonstrated by injections ; and in this respect young subjects areas fit for the study of the arteries as for that of the nerves; in these the vessels are more predominant, only the neigh- bouring parts being less developed, the connec- tions cannot be so readily ascertained. In proportion as the infant increases in age, an equilibrium in the system of the red blood is gra- dually established. In the head, the arteries of the face become more striking, and with regard to their developement, are placed by degrees on a level with the cereoral arteries. In the chest, the thymus gland decreases progressively as the

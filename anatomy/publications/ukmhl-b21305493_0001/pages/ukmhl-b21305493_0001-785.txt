643 EXMALANT SYSTEM. fluence of the vital powers, since it constantly varies in a part accordingly as these vital powers also Vary; besides, if exhaled fluids transuded through inorganic parieties, it would be requisite, that not only the vascular parieties, but also those of the serous surfaces which receive this fluid, should be perforated with innumerable minute holes; but why is it then, that the fluids, for which they form reservoirs, do not transude into the cellular tissue ? Let us then lay aside all kind of opinion unsupported by anatomical ob- servation, and endeavour, according to this obser- vation, to discover what exhalants are. To form a correct idea of the organs, always concealed from us by their excessive tenuity in the natural state, is undoubtedly attended with great difficulty. By means, however, of experi- ments and strict reasoning, it appears to me that this end might be attained. We have seen that the existence of a capillary system terminating the arteries, is indisputably proved by experiments with injections, by in- flammations spontaneously produced, and by those formed at will in parts where exhalation takes place, as well as in others, in such a manner even, that a serous, a cutaneous surface, &c. where nothing appeared before, is in the first case in- stantaneously covered with an innumerable num- ber of small vessels, and also in the second, after an interval of time more or less variable.

516 VASCULAR SYSTEM circulation in a branch, and force the fluid to re-flow through the anastomosis to another. It may also be remarked, that an obstacle which cannot influence the arterial circulation, on ac- count of the power that propels it, may materially affect that of the veins, which is but feebly con- ducted. The blood of this system, like that of the pre- ceding, is influenced by gravity. Hence we find, that the hemorrhoidal veins, being more exposed to this influence than the others, are more fre- quently affected with varices; dilatations even are seldom met with in the superior mesenteric, gastro-epiploic, splenic, veins, &c.; whilst, in no part are they so frequently observed as in the hemorrhoidal vessels : thus we have very seldom found the preceding system dilated in the upper, but frequently so in the lower parts of the body. The system of the dark abdominal blood has but little communication with the general system. If anastomosis exist, it is only in the last divisions; yet this is a question. I believe these two fluids should be considered as distinct from each other. i Organization, Properties, $c. Many authors (Haller particularly), believing that the system we are now considering is not provided with an impulsive agent, have admitted that these tubes possess a solidity ol struc- 4\ * . \ V

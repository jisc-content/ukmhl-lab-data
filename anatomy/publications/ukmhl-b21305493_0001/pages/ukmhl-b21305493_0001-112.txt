Ixxii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Morgagni, to whom we owe so much on this head, and many others to whom the art is not so deeply indebted, have adopted the general order used in descriptions. They have studied the affections of the head, chest, the belly, and extremities, but it is impossible, in pursuing such a method as theirs, to form a general idea of the alterations common to the various tissues. It must of necessity, restrict ourjdeas to too circumscribed a compass, since it only presents us one single isolated part of a sys- tem which comprehends many more. If, notwith- standing this, we arrive at a general knowledge of the affections of each system, we must, doubtless, study them separately, according to the general notions we have of the whole. It appears to me infinitely more easy first to con- sider diseases common to each system, and after- wards to study the peculiarities of each organ in the cavity which it occupies. I divide then morbid anatomy into two parts. The first, comprises the description of the altera- tions common to each system, whatever be the organ concerned, or the cavity occupied. It is necessary, at first, to explain the different morbid changes of the cellular tissues, the arterial, venous, nervous, bony, muscular, mucous, synoval, glandu- lar, cutaneous, &c.; to examine closely their modes of inflammation, suppuration, gangrene, &c. to describe the various tumours they are subject to, and the various organic alterations they sustain, &c. Some, in this point of view, as

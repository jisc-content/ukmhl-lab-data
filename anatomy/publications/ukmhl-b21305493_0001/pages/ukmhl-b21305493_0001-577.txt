OF THE DARK BLOOD. 435 SECTION II. Course of the Veins. On issuing from the general capillary system, as we have just stated, veins take different direc- tions. 1st. In the limbs and in the external organs of the body, they are continued in two sets, the one internal that attends the arteries ; the other external, which is the sub-cutaneous. 2dly. In the internal organs a similar observation is frequently ^pade: Thus, there are superficial veins for the loi&E, and deep veins accompanying the arteries. All these, however, are often united - to those which attend the artery. The cutaneous division of the veins is very remarkable in the extremities, where it displays considerable branches; namely, the saphenae in the inferior ; the cephalic, the basilic, and their numerous divisions in the superior extremities. In the trunk and in the head, such a considerable number of sub-cutaneous branches are not ob- served, except in the neck, where the external jugular vein is seen ; but there are a number of branches smaller in proportion to the ramifi- cations that resort to these parts. The external parts are then remarkable for the predominance of trunks carrying dark blood over

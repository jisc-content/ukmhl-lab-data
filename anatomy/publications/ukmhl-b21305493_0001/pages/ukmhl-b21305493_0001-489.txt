OV THE RED BLOOD. 347 excessive softness, is very remarkable in arteries ; it is this by which they are especially distinguished from veins. This elasticity keeps their coats dis- tended, although they are void of blood. They are . the only tubes, together with those composed of cartilage, as the trachea, the auditory passage of the foetus, Ac. which are also endowed with elasti- city, that keep open of themselves. All the others collapse whenever they are not distended by the fluids that pass through them. To the elasticity of the arterial parieties must be attributed the sudden return to their natural state, whenever their cavities have been oblite- rated by pressure, the instantaneous longitudinal direction assumed by an arterial tube that has been curved, &c. This property also takes an essential part in the kind of locomotion which arteries undergo at the approach of the blood. In fact, if a curved arterial trunk be laid bare in a living animal, we shall perceive it to rise entirely at every pulsation, to relinquish its station and to straighten, parti- cularly in the parts that are bent. At the moment injections penetrate into a small and lean sub- ject, a locomotion of all the winding arterial branches of the face is very distinctly ascertained through the integuments. Now it is evident, that if arteries were not composed of a firm and elas- tic membrane, they could not thus sustain the motion to which they are subjected; besides, let G G 2

307 OF THE RED BLOOD* safety of these organs. In fractures of the lower jaw, they prevent the laceration of the artery that passes through that bone, a laceration with- out these would be unavoidable: through these the arterial system is protected from injury, in the violent, and frequently unnatural motions the limbs perform. The extensibility of the arteries would not be sufficient to allow of such motions; in fact, when- ever a straight artery has been extended its diameter contracts. In accommodating themselves to the motions of parts, the circulation would be impeded, because less space would be afforded to the blood for this fluid to move in. This explains why, on the surfaces of every part, subject to alternate distentions and contrac- tions, the arteries being constantly tortuous, are calculated without any actual extension to be variously elongated. I have remarked, in this respect, that the locomotion in arteries, ascer- tained by Veitbrecht, is much more striking during the contraction of the hollow organs, or the flexion of the limbs, than during the dilatation of the one, and the extension of the other. I have repeatedly made this remark in living ani- mals. By emptying or distending the intestines, the stomach, the bladder, &c., the pulsation of their arteries is more or less increased.

NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ANIMAL LIFE. 123 respiration, and the secretions, depend in a more particular manner upon organic life, where it acts a more obscure part than that of the preceding. Neither of them are strictly limited to the organs of either of these lives. Thus the cerebral nerves send some ramifications to the glands, the invo- luntary muscles, &c. In like manner the nervous system distributes some branches to the voluntary muscles. It is upon the general disposition and the abstraction of particular exceptions, that the division of the two nervous systems is grounded, between which I do not intend to draw now a dis- tinctive line to establish their difference, because the simple exposition of each is sufficiently de- monstrated. The nervous system, like all the organs of that life, is exactly symmetrical. The brain and the medulla oblongata, which are the double sources of this system, exhibit this character in an eminent- degree. Nerves exactly alike start from each of them ; from thence the appellation of pairs, by which the double corresponding trunk is de- scribed, a term which generally cannot be applied to the system of ganglions. There are then two nervous systems in animal life, the one on the right, the other on the left side ; they are sepa- rated by the median line. This distinction is ap- parent, not only in dissection but likewise in dis- eases ; at times one lateral half of the body is perfectly deprived of motion, and the whole of one q 2

712 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. like that of every similar gland ; that their vo- lume, however, distinguishes them from all the others. I have remarked that the dark colour of these glands, and of the continued fluid, is little af- fected by the action of acids, alkalies, or by boiling. The absorbents ramify in the proper tissue of the lymphatic glands; after having entered it in a certain number, and each of them by numer- ous ramifications, they divide on their exit in several other branches, which give rise to an infinite number of ramifications. Each gland may in this respect be considered as a centre of two small capillary systems, opposed to each other, and anastomising together. In the interior of these glands these ramifications, excessively flexible, are folded together in different ways, occupy a considerable part of the peculiar tissue of these organs, so that several have in consequence been thought to be nothing more than the inter- weaving of the absorbents,â€”an idea without foundation, since this tissue has not yet been properly investigated. I have observed that it is less susceptible of contraction than the greatest part of the other animal tissues : it approaches in this respect that of the real glands, but differs from it in this respect, that, instead of becoming harder by boiling, it soon softens, and is converted into a pulp, and on pressure dissolves under the finger. Acids, after having caused this tissue to skrink.

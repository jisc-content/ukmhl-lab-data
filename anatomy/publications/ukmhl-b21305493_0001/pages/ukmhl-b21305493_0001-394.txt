NERVOUS SYSTEM 252 and its branches so very small? 7thly. In what manner could we account for the frequent inter- ruptions existing amongst the ganglions of the human species, and for those constantly ascertained in a considerable number of animals, if there were a continuation between the nervous filaments that enter into the ganglion above, and those which proceed from it below ? 8thly. How is it that ganglions and their nerves do not follow in their developement an exact proportion with the cerebral nerves, if it be by the expansion of these that they are produced ?â€”and 9thly. Why do not painful sensations bear the same characteristics in these two kinds of nerves ? I have formed no opinion in respect to the na- ture and the functions of ganglions, because I am unprovided with facts to support it; but most un- doubtedly, their texture admits of something more than the mere expansion of the nervous filaments. Scarpa admits of a peculiar matter, which separates these filaments; but that sub- stance ought then to predominate very consider- ably, since the bulk of the ganglion exceeds by far, that of the nerves to which its origin is attri- buted. Now, I have never seen this substance; I do not know what it is: divide a ganglion, and it is perfectly solid. I am then induced to be- lieve, that in admitting, to a certain degree, the interior conformation, which that author has ob-

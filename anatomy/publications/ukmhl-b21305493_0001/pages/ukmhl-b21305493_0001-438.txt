296 VASCULAR SYSTEM when, after having removed the valves, we shall readily distinguish, by the transparency of the internal membrane, and the opacity of the three festoons at the commencement of the aorta, the construction I have just described. From this it follows, that if, after the artery is accurately dissected, we detach from below upwards the in- ternal membrane that forms the great canal for the circulation of the red blood, this vessel sepa- rates entirely from the heart. This evident separation of the aortic fibres, and those of the heart, would furnish strong grounds for supposing that they are not of the same nature, if it were not fully established by numerous other considerations. Origin of the Trunks, Branches, and Ramifications, The aorta, arising in the manner already men- tioned from the left ventricle, almost imrne- diately divides into two tersefees-; an ascending one, which proceeds to the neck, head, and the superior extremities ; the other, descending, which supplies the chest, pelvis, and the inferior extre- mities. The former, subdividing directly into four principal trunks, differs in this respect from the latter, which forms for a considerable length one continued trunk. This, having to pursue a longer course than the other, more effectually

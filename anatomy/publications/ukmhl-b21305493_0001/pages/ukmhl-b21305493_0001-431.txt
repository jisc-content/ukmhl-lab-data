The great trunks of the absorbents are in- cessantly adding the lymph of the cellular tissue, and of the serous surfaces ; the residue form the nutritive matter of all the organs, the supera- bundant fat, sinovia and marrow. 2dly. Every thing within, that is to be rejected, is received by it. The chyle produced by digestion, is first in- variably carried into the great canal, where it cir- culates. In the second place, with this, are ming- led the atmospheric principles that traverse the lungs in the act of respiration. Finally, when- ever cutaneous or mucous absorptions take place, the dark blood is always the first to receive the produce. From thence it follows, that the circulation of the dark blood, is, if I may so express myself, a general reservoir into which every thing that is to be expelled the body, and that enters it, is first deposited. In this respect it acts a very essential part in diseases; in fact, it cannot be doubted, 1st. That noxious substances may be introduced with the chyle into the economy, and by circulating with the fluids, produce disorders more or less sensi- ble. To produce this effect, it suffices, that the organic sensibility of the chyliferous vessels be impaired; they will then admit what they had

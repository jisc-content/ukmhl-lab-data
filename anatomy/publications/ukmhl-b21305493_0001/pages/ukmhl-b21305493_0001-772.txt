CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 630 is infinitely less sonorous in the morning' than in the evening. Two months ago a patient died in the hospital, the distinction was very striking in this subject from hour to hour. In the greatest number of cases the progress is certainly less rapid, it cannot be called in question; but the dark blood had contributed to produce this state of the lungs. No organ whatever in the animal economy acquires by inflammation greater size and weight in so short a time, of which all who are in the habit of opening the dead body are convinced. When divided in those who have died from peri- pneumony, we are induced to say it is the solids that have increased: in respect to weight, it fre- quently resembles the liver, but if submitted to maceration, the whole will become fluid. Now if we examine comparatively the skin, the stomach, the liver, the kidneys, &c., after acute inflammation, followed by death, they ex- hibit nothing to be compared to this enormous increase of fluid with which the substance of the lungs is loaded ; from inflammation, not only the spaces in the cells are filled, but the organ is also considerably dilated. I have had frequent opportunities of dissecting the bodies of those who have died of peripneumony, in which I found one of the lobes perfectly sound ; but the dispro- portion in weight between the sound lobe and the other was incomparably greater than that between

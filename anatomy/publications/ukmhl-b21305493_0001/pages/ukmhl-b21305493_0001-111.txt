lxxi general considerations. skin, may be acute or chronic ; but if we generalise it, it becomes illogical and absurd. An inflamma- tion of the mucous membrane would be chronic if it lasted two-months ; but this is, neverthe- less, the period of an inflammatory attack in the bones. A chronic affection of the same kind would last a whole year or more. Wounds of the soft parts rarely exceed five or six days if they heal by the first intention, but a bone or carti- lage requires thirty or forty days for the perfect union of the divided parts. A disease then, as to duration, cannot be divided into acute or chronic, unless it be considered locally in parts of the same organ: if generally considered, the distinction ceases. Physicians take a narrow and abstract view of "almost all diseases. If they speak of inflammation, they represent redness, tension, throbbing, and pain, &c. as its inseparable and uniform properties. If it be suppuration, they take that of the cellular mem- brane in phlegmon for a common type, without recollecting that this is only one of the modifica- tions of suppuration and its products. The same in respect to gangrene, scirrhous, &c. Nothing is more loose, more unsystematic, and indefinite, than thÂ§ general ideas advanced in lectures on disease: they are hardly applicable to one or two tissues. The anatomy of systems not only reflects a strong light upon the history of diseases, but it also alters m some degree our views of morbid anatomy.

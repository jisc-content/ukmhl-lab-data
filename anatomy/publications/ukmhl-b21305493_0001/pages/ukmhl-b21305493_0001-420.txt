278 VASCULAR SYSTEM SECTION I. Division of Circulation. 1 divide circulation into two kinds: the one conveys the blood from the lungs to every part of the body, the other returns it to the lungs ; the first is the circulation of the red blood: the second, that of the black. Circulation of the Bed Blood. The circulation of the red blood has its origin in the capillary system of the lungs, where it as- sumes the peculiar character that distinguishes it from the black, in consequence of the principles which it borrows from air. From this system, it passes into the first divisions, and, subsequently, into the trunks of the pulmonary veins; these pour it into the left auricle of the heart, which transmits it to the ventricle, from whence it is propelled into the arteries and distributed through the general capillary system, which may indeed be considered the termination of its course. The red blood is then continually conveyed from the capillary system of the lungs to the capillary system in general. The cavities that contain it are all lined with one continued membrane,

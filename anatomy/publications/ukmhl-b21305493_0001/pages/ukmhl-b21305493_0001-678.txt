536 vascular system constant with man. I have not dissected a single dog in which this has not proved to be constantly the case, when the stomach was empty,, and par- ticularly, if that state had been continued for some time. Dead bodies are not very proper subjects for resolving this question, because the nature of the disease almost unavoidably affects the course, the nature, and the colour of the bile. I shall explain, in the next volume, what consequences are to be drawn from this observation, in respect to bilious vomitings. In the state of fulness, it has appeared to me impossible to ascertain the reflux of the bile; at other times, I have seen between the alimentary pulp and the parieties of the stomach, yellowish gastric fluids, but this mass is never impregnated with this colour. The bile that re-flows into the stomach has constantly, from its light colour, appeared to me the hepatic bile. I have opened, I believe, a suf- ficient number of living animals, to affirm that in the state of health, that very green fluid charac- terized, resembling, as it is said, the colour of leeks, which evidently proceeds from the gall bladder, and is vomited in peculiar diseases, is never found in the stomach. The reflux of this bile appears to proceed from this affection. This observation accords with that above stated,namely, that the hepatic bile alone flows into the duodenum during abstinence. This only, then, as in fact is

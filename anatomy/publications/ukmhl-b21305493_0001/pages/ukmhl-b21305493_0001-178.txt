36 CELLULAR SYSTEM* about the bladder, rectum, and womb. This ap- pears to depend on the following cause : as on one hand these three organs are subject to great increase of capacity, and on the other the bony parieties of the pelvis can in no wise accommo- date themselves to their dilatation, as is the case with the parieties of the abdomen, it was neces- sary that something should be substituted so that the cavity of the pelvis should be filled up, what- ever might be the state of the above organs. This liberal provision of cellular tissue is accordingly devoted to this particular use. If the motions of the brain, like those of the latter, were alternately to increase and diminish the bulk of the organ, nature, undoubtedly would, on account of the hard and unyielding cavity in which it is lodged, have provided it abundantly with cellular tissue. To conclude, we well know the influence of this increased proportion of the cellular tissue in the pelvis, in abscesses adjacent to the anus, extravasations of urine, arising from some breach in the bladder, or urethra, &c. We are aware of the facility with which pus and urine extend in such parts, and the danger that attends their ravages. This tissue communicates with that of the in- ferior extremities through the ischiatic notch, under the arch of the pubis, &c. Several authors have related cases where fistulous sinuses

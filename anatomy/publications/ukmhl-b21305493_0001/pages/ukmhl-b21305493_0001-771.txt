629 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. ference between this membrane and all others similar, a difference it is indebted to the organ it envelopes. Various causes contribute to this remarkable propensity to pulmonary inflamma- tions; 1st. Amongst the internal organs the lungs are the most exposed to direct irritations, either by air that habitually penetrates them, and may cause irritation, or by heterogeneous sub- stances of which it is the vehicle, or still more from the alternate changes of heat and cold; 2dly. This organ is connected with the other systems, the cutaneous for instance, by numerous sympathies, so far even, that perhaps in regard to inflammation, the lungs alone are more influ- enced by a suppression of perspiration than all the other organs together, which undoubtedly depends upon this organ answering alone to all the other capillary vessels. When the lungs are affected with inflamma- tion, is it the red blood of the bronchial artery, or the dark blood of the pulmonary artery, that flows to the irritated part ? I rather think this question could not be easily resolved by experi- ment, but the inspection of dead bodies seems to prove that the latter takes a very active part: in fact, this organ is frequently filled with such rapidity, that it is not easy to attribute this to the former; sometimes, which however is not always the case, we might, as it were, follow the pro- gress of this surcharge by the percussion, wThich

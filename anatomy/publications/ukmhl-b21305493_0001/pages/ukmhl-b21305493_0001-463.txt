321 OF THE RED JJLOOD. then should it be the only one that requires it ? This phenomenon alone would be sufficient to distinguish the arterial texture from the muscu- lar. In fact, the preceding experiment, perform- ed on a part of the intestines where the fibres are disposed, as those of the arteries, will occasion a depression or a contact of these fibres, but will not divide them. Besides, let us compare the properties of the arterial texture with the muscular; then their vital properties, by associating the chapters in which I have explained these properties; let us oppose to each their respective developements, and particularly the various morbid alterations to which both are liable, and we shall find that they have not a single point in which there is the least analogy. Aneurism of the heart, and that of the arteries, have nothing in common but the name. In the one, there is laceration of the arterial fibres and dilatation of the cellular cover- ing ; in the other, an unnatural increase, a real developement of muscular fibres, that retain both their appearance and properties. Notwithstanding the facility with which, in cases of aneurism, the arterial fibres lacerate, they possess in the natural state a very considerable degree of strength, and are capable of affording great resistance : another characteristic of fleshy texture.

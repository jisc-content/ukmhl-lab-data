CELLULAR SYSTEM. uniform halves, is a general attribute of the or- gans of animal life, an attribute that distinguishes them from those of internal life, which are re- markable for their irregularity : it is in this light, and not in that which Bordeu has placed it, and which runs manifestly counter to anatomical facts, that the median line should be viewed. In other parts of the body, the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue varies considerably in its texture. 1st. The density of this texture is remarkable in the hairy scalp of the skull, which, on this ac- count is not easily separated from the subjacent fascia and muscles. Such as are familiar with the dissection of apoplectic subjects, are well aware / that the head and neck are in an emphysermatous state. I have already seen this phenomenon in four bodies. The face is accordingly much inflated, the hairy scalp not at all, or at least in a very small degree, 2dly. In the face the sub-cutaneous tissue is very loose, and extremely abundant. 3dly. It is equally loose in almost all parts of the trunk, and accommodates itself easily to the motions of its wide and powerful muscles. 4thly. In the extremities, the sub-cutaneous cel- lular tissue, situated between the apounerosis and the skin, observes almost in every part an equal proportion and laxity. It is only in the palm of the hand, and the sole of the foot, that its texture, increasing in density, there is stronger adhesion of the fascia to the skin, an arrangement highly favourable to the uses of these two parts, which

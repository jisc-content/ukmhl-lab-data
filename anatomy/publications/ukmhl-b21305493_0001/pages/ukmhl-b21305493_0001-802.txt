A proof, that in active he- morrhage, it is the organic sensibility which, being differently modified, allows or refuses the blood to pass through the exhalants, that previous symp- toms almost constantly exist, continuing more or less, and evidently denoting a defect in the vital powers, and especially of the organic sensibility. We are familiar with the sensation that precedes hemorrhage from the nose, the titillation and burning sensation previous to those of the chest; sometimes, according to the varieties of alteration in the organic sensibility, it first suffers serous fluids to transude, and afterwards those of the nature of blood. This is evident during menstrua- tion, in which the exhalants frequently pour out for a few moments their pure blood. In respect to passive hemorrhage, it is certain that organic sensibility, as well as the insensible organic contractility, have been reduced; we might suppose that these minute vessels cannot contract sufficiently to retain the blood ; that it is the very same thing occurs as with injections which shower from the mucous surfaces, because vitality is no longer an obstacle to the transuda- tion. It may also be remarked, that whenever these hemorrhages proceed from an organic dis- ease, it is,constantly fBe'caneel thf part of the mu- cous surface that approaches nearest to the organ is influenced by it. Thus, in the last stages of the diseases of the heart and of the lungs, blood

OF ANIMAL LIFE. 179 reason why the mere contact without compres- sion, is hardly attended with pain; why a nerve may almost with impunity remain immerged in a purulent or ichorous fluid, in the sanious matter even of a cancer; why contact of air is scarcely felt when the nerves are merely laid bare, as I have had numberless opportunities to ascer- tain on animals; why, in numberless cases different tumours in the vicinity of which nerves are situate, have little influence over them. The membrane of each filament is in reality in all these in- stances a kind of shelter protecting their me- dullary substance, which is eminently the seat of sensibility. In respect to the cellular texture, which con- curs to the formation of nerves, it is, as in every other case, a stranger to this property. Why can we, as I have frequently done on living ani- mals, separate with the point of a very fine scalpel, the different filaments of a large nerve ; the sciatic, for instance, when they have been previously laid bare, without the animal expe- riencing much pain. In these experiments it is easy to be convinced of the deficiency of sensibi- lity in the sheath of every nervous filament. It must be cut across, and the medullary substance must be injured to produce pain. In experiments, the animal sensibility of the nerve seems by degrees to be exhausted, and finally to cease. I have ascertained it in the eighth pair,

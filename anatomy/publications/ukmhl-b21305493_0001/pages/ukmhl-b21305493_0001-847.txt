70 5 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. tery they seem excessively multiplied along the vertebral column. The whole of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, viewed in any other part than anterior to the spine, is also abundantly supplied. A number of these glands are found accumulated in the mesentery, at the origin of the lungs, round the bronchiae and in the pelvis. From such dis- position we perceive that, 1st. The lymphatic glands are in general more multiplied in such parts where the cellular tissue, in which they are in some measure im- merged, is more abundant; a very remarkable connection, for which we can assign no precise cause. There are few parts in the economy in which this tissue is abundant that do not also contain these kind of organs, and reciprocally wherever the tissue is deficient the absorbant glands are wanting^ 2dly. It is also observed that such parts as are more distant from the common absorbents, as the head, the extremities, &c., are more sparingly provided with them ; that the nearer we approach these common trunks, the more these glands are multiplied; so that it might be said they form around them a kind of limit by which they are separated from the absorbents of a second order, insuring at the same time the means of communi- cation between them. The size of the lymphatic glands varies from

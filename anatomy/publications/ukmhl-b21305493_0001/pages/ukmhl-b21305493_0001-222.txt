80 CELLULAR SYSTEM. formation may have some influence in modifying their extensibility. The cellular tissue when dis- tended to its utmost, grows thinner, and then breaks. It is impossible for any motion of the frame in the living state, however powerful, to produce a rupture therein. I have remarked, for instance, that it is necessary to exert a force three times greater than that which acts in the elevation of the arm to produce this effect on cellular tissue taken from the axilla. There is, 4 moreover, a species of locomotion peculiar to it which prevents such an accident, so that when it is much stretched, it displaces the contiguous tissue, draws it along with it, and is thus less distended itself. This is strikingly exemplified in enlargements of the testicle, in hydrocele of some bulk, &c. In this case the integuments covering the lower part of the abdomen, the thigh and perineum, are forcibly drawn over the tumour, the covering of which they help to form. I have remarked that the cellular tissue, when inflamed, loses this property in degree, and is easily ruptured in the dead body. This also happens in the various indurations of which it is the seat,—that portion for instance, which sur- rounds the uterus in a state of cancer, being much enlarged, loses all power of extension, it is even, if I may so express myself, grown perfectly brittle,—the least effort occasions rupture. This

699 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. experiments. In this respect, as well as in many others, physiology is still in the dark. In fact, we find ; 1st. An enormous disproportion between the absorbents and their common trunks. 2dly. The impossibility of conceiving accurately, the lymphatic circulation from the analogy of veins, with the apparatus displayed by injecting these vessels. Sdly. There are numerous probabilities against, and a few in support of veinous absorption. 4thly. No other means of communication, besides the trunks above stated, for fluids pene- trating from the absorbents into the blood, are yet ascertained. In the different theories adduced to resolve this question, there is nothing but obscu- rity and contradiction. ■' t '/ . »i SECTION IV. Structure of the Absorbents. This structure, admitting of investigation in the large trunks only, for instance, in the thora- cic duct, first displays in its common organiza- tion, a layer of that dense cellular tissue, already so frequently described, and still to be noticed, which is found around the arteries, the veins, the excretories, under the serous surfaces, &c. &c. 3 f °>

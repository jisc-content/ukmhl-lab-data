OF THE DARK BLOOD. 489 same thing1 as when, in the dead body, a syringe being adapted to a vein, and this completely filled, if the piston be a little withdrawn, the fluid instantly returning, the vein contracts ; or, as when the blood is discharged by a puncture, the vein does not contract; yet this does not imply any irritability. I believe, that in some instances this reflux may proceed from an irregular motion of the heart contracting in a direction contrary to its na- tural one, although no obstacle exists in the lungs. What induces me to believe this is, that very fre- quently during experiments, at the moment the animal begins to suffer severely, the reflux takes place before the lungs could have been affected. The quickness with which pain affects the motions of the heart, rendering them more frequent, irre- gular, &c. is in general very remarkable. By giving the animal pain, the respiration may al- ways be regulated at will; but the acceleration of the pulse constantly precedes that of respira- tion, which it seems to determine. I am con- vinced, that if the diseases of the heart were as frequent in the right side as in the left, they would very often produce this reflux and pulsation in the veins. The limits of the reflux of the veinous blood varv. Haller has observed this reflux as far as in the iliac veins. In general, on account of the valves, it does not go beyond the large trunks. VOL. I.

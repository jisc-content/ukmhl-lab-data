518 VASCULAR SYSTEM lections, &c. I have frequently irritated in vari- ous ways, the mesenteric veins, (to which easy admittance is obtained), by drawing a part of the intestinal bundle, through a slight incision in the abdomen: the results have always been the same as in the preceding system, with this distinc- tion only, that when air is introduced, the animal does not struggle, apparently suffers no pain, and the experiment is not attended with dangerous consequences, which proves still more, that it is not its contact with the veins of the heart that proves fatal, but its action upon the brain. The common membrane of the system we are now considering, is distinguished from that of the preceding, by being completely deprived of valves. This seems to proceed from two causes, 1st. The course of the blood being shorter, the fluid can better dispense with this support. 2dly. The middle portion of this system being unpro- vided with an impulsive agent, there is no reflux, as in the preceding. In fact, at each contraction, the right auricle, as I have stated, returns a part of its fluid in the veins, which by means of the valves form an obstacle to it; here, on the con- trary, the course of the fluid is constantly uniform from one capillary system to another,â€”there is nothing to cause a retrograde motion. /

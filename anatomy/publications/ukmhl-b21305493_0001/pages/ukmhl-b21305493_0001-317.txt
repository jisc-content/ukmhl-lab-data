175 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Nerves. Does the theca receive small nervous branches? Do these small branches penetrate the nerves in the same manner as the minute arteries ramify in the parietes of the large arteries ? Anatomical in- spection proves nothing of the kind. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Nervous System in Animal Life. SECTION I. Properties of the Tissue. Few systems are possessed of this property in a less degree than this. If a nerve in a living ani- mal be drawn in opposite directions, it stretches with difficulty, affords considerable resistance, and is rendered, in a trifling degree only, longer than in its natural state. This appears to proceed especially from the theca; the medullary substance would yield with much more facility. We know how great an extension that of the brain admits of in dropsies of the ventricles. If a large trunk be stretched by a subjacent tumour, as in popli- teal aneurism, swellings in the axilla, &c. it is compressed in the shape of a ribbon; its fila-

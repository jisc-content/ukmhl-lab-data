ABSORBANT* SYSTEM. 709 in a slack, extensible, and very abundant cel- lular tissue, that accommodates their motion, and admits of their being* displaced when pushed by the finger. Hence that very remarkable mo- bility observed in the greater part of these organs in the early periods of their obstructions, when that tissue has not itself been yet affected, they partake of the injury, gradually become less flaccid, and adhere to the surrounding parts. Thus, at first moveable in cancer, these glands are subsequently fixed: they are generally im- movable also in cases of acute inflammations, be- cause the adjacent tissue has partaken of the disease. The cellular tissue besides supplies the glands with a dense membrane that envelopes them in a more direct manner, and which membrane, not being provided with fat and serum, appears of the same nature as the cellular covering of the absorbents. It is this membrane, that in the natural state gives to the gland in general a smooth and polished appearance, for, when in- jected, mercury discloses in these organs a few asperities, owing to the projection of the ves- sels with which they are internally supplied. A few slight depressions are also observed over their surfaces; these depressions are to the glands, what the furrows of the concave surfaces of the liver, spleen, and the lungs, are to these

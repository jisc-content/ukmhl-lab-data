355 OF THE KEU BLOOD. uess. 2dly. To have it held by an assistant. 3dly. To introduce the bistoury between this and the vascular mass. 4thly. To cut first this mass, leaving the canal uninjured. 5thly. Then to apply the ligature to the artery which is indicated by the stream of blood. Gthly. When this is completed, to remove also the ms deferens. It is evident that by this division, performed separately, we have the advantage of applying the ligature with- out a fear from the contractions of the artery, since the vas deferens to which it adheres, and which is not removed till the artery is tied, suffices to secure it. I have never performed this opera- tion myself, but it is evident there is nothing to prevent this mode of operating, since the parts are sound where it is performed. Besides, I have always taught the pupils to operate in this way with facility, when the cord, in consequence of disease, having extended, must be removed very near io the ring ; this mode of operation has ap- peared to me to afford great advantages. I believe that the retraction of arteries that have been drawn out, and then their contraction, act an important part in the absence of he- morrhage attending most wounds produced by lacerationâ€”a singular phenomenon, by which such wounds are especially distinguished from those produced by a cutting instrument, even vhen some considerable vessel has been divided.

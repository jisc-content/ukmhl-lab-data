Others, as the ten- dons, muscles and nerves, are less frequently disor- ganized in structure. We shall find hereafter that nutrition alone is performed in some ; that others, on the contrary, are employed besides in exhalation, absorption, secretion, &c.; func- tions that denote no small energy in the insen- sible contractility and organic sensibility which preside over all alterations of structure.

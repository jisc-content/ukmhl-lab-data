25 CELLULAR SYSTEM. tissue becomes very apparent, because the organ is thereby deprived of its closeness of texture, and assumes one of a looser and more spongy sort, that allows the cellular substance found in the interval of its fibres to be exposed with greater precision and delicacy by the knife. ARTICLE II. The Cellular System considered independently of the Organs. After having considered the cellular system, in connection with the organs, we shall pass over those parts it surrounds and penetrates, and investigate it merely as a continuous body, extend- ing in every direction, and filling up the spaces between the organs, being analogous, in this point of view, to almost every other primitive system. Let us follow it in the head, trunk, and extremity. SECTION i. Of the Cellular System in the Head. The cranium and face differ exceedingly in structure with regard to the cellular tissue ; in the former it is very scarce, and in the latter, abundant in proportion. VOL. i. k

OF THE DARK BLOOD. 457 but as this trunk merely returns the blood from the heart, we shall, in these general considerations, take little notice of it, as well as of those minute veins that pass separately to the same auricle. Some authors have conceived that the venae eavee continued together, forming a single vessel only; but it is easy to perceive how very diffe- rent are their directions. This distinction is most obvious in the foetus, since one corresponds to the right auricle, and the other to the left. At the back of the right auricle, there is certainly a kind of continued membrane between them : it is the membrane of the dark blood common to both, and which projects from the inferior to the su- perior vessel; but in this respect they are not more continuous than the right side of the heart and the pulmonary artery, or the left and the aorta, &c. In considering the whole of the trunks, and of the branches, as forming a cone, we may then say there exist two large veinous cones, distinct from each other ; the one intended for all the parts situate above the diaphragm, the other for those below it. Then the vena cava ascendens does not always answer to the whole of the arteries that form the aorta, of the same description, which is only intended for the head, neck, and the superior extremities, whilst this appertains also to the chest through the azygos vein.

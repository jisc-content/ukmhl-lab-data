OF ANIMAL LIFE. 183 because two days ago I had run a pin through one of the anterior nerves, taking care to pene- trate the medullary filaments in the experiment. This precaution is essential; for having transfixed the cellular membrane which separates the filaments of the sciatic nerve, I obtained no result; how- ever, I must confess, that these experiments are not always attended with success, and that on irritating a nerve in any part whatever, I have sometimes not been able to produce any parti- cular occurrence; 5thly, The tying of nerves has scarcely ever been attended with bad conse- quences, because the communication to the brain is intercepted by the cause that produces the irritation, and also because the medullary sub- stance is compressed, and its sensibility extin- guished. Accidents, however, have frequently occurred from tying the nerve, in the operation for aneurism ; and although there is no real danger in this method of using the ligature, yet all the best practitioners recommend it to be avoided. These different considerations establish, in a positive manner, the influence that an irritated part of a nerve may have on the animal sensibi- lity of all the subjacent ramifications. Physicians do not sufficiently attend to this cause of painful sensations, which are sometimes felt to a very considerable extent, without any apparent injury. A nerve irritated in a case of fracture of the ribs, m that of a limb, in a wound, tumor, &c. may

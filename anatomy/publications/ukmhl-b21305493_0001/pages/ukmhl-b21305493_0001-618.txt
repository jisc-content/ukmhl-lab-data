VASCULAR SYSTEM 476 mon membrane, that seems to contain a quantity, and which, perhaps, is partly indebted to this cir- cumstance, for the remarkable extensibility it possesses. I have observed, that the existence of the cellu- lar tissue in the parieties of the veins, is a distinc- tive and decisive character, that separates them from the arteries, with which, in other respects, they have not the slightest analogy. Exhalants and Absorbents. It appears, that no kind of exhalation takes place on the internal surface of the veins. This surface is constantly moist in the dead body, even though the vessels are empty ; but as in the arte- ries, I attribute this phenomenon to a transudation that takes place after death. In fact, if a fluid had been exhaled, it would prevent the ad- herences between the veinous parieties, when during life the blood has ceased to pass through them, but every vein that has remained empty, closes, forming a kind of ligament, an effect, which, under similar circumstances, applies also to the arteries. Absorption is also wanting in the internal sur- face of the veins. To ascertain this, I have at- tempted on the internal and external jugular veins, &c., the very same experiment before-mentioned, as performed on the carotid artery: I obtained a

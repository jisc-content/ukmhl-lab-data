The secretory, circulating, and pulmonary organs, &c., may then be specially affected in their peculiar membranes, and inde- pendently of the nerves they admit; but it is certainly a most interesting object of research, and there is too great a difference between y-the phenomena of both these orders of affections, for their primary seats to be the same.

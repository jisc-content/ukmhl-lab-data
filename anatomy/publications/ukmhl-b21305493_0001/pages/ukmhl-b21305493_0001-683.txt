This trifling increase, however, is no com- pensation for the loss of blood from the umbilical vein. Thus, the volume of the liver decreases in a sensible manner. In respect to the veinous canal, it closes by the contraction of its tissue. The blood flowing through the vena porta has no tendency, as I have before stated, to flow in this canal, because it is not in its direction ; it passes in preference through the hepatic vessels, and then the circula- tion in the liver begins, as it is ever afterwards continued. Such then, is the difference caused by birth in the hepatic circulation : 1st. Less blood, and but one kind of this fluid reaching the lungs: 2dly. Interruption of all kind of communication between the dark abdominal blood and the rest: 3dlv. A proportionate reduction in the volume of the liver. Hence, a reverse phenomenon at the mo- ment of birth, in respect to this organ and the lungs ; this increases both in activity and size, the other decreases. The immense quantity of blood that previous to birth reaches the liver, and the size of this organ, when compared to the small quantity of bile that flows from it, are evident

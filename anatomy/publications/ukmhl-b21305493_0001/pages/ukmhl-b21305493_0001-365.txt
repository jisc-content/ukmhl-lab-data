OF ANIMAL LIFE. 223 dullary parts of that substance are afterwards much less distinct, because the latter is not quite so white. At this stage of life it is readily dis- solved, by means of caustic alkali. Its first effect before complete dissolution takes place, is to con- vert the cerebral substance into a glutinous, vis- cous, and transparent matter, of a reddish hue, and ropy, almost like the white of an egg. I have observed nothing similar in my experi- ments upon the brain in the adult subject, under the same process.* Acids coagulate the cerebral substance in the foetus, which, however, is not rendered so hard as at a more advanced age. The excessive softness of the brain in the foetus renders its dissection very difficult. The nerves of animal life have a proportional increase with that of the brain. They are all very remarkable in size, compared to the other parts. Thus the foetus, and the infant, when not too young, are fit subjects for the study of the nervous system, which is rendered more obvious by the slight developement of the other system. Their medullary substance, like that of the brain, and of the spinal marrow, is excessively soft, even dissolving under the finger, as may be seen on the anterior part of the optic nerve, where it is very striking, although inclosed by the ducts of the theca ; in the posterior part of the same nerve; in the olfactory, in which it is seen in an insulated state ; in the auditory, where

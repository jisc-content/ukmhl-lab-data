170 NERVOUS SYSTEM ) have ascertained that, most generally at least, â€¢ their branches do not pass from the nerves in the same part where the arteries are admitted. This disposition is analogous to that of the brain, in which these penetrate in the inferior part, and the others proceed from above. Several authors, particularly Reil, have exag- gerated the quantity of blood that reaches the nerves, because, to judge of it, they have em- ployed fine injections, that have penetrated into the capillary system, where, in general, no red blood is contained. I have been convinced how deceitful are these means, both in this case as in others; dissecting the nerves in living animals is the only method of forming a correct idea of what takes place in the natural state. The blood that penetrates the nerves is like that which reaches the brain, a stimulant that sustains their action. When this stimulant is augmented, the nervous excitability is also in- creased, as Reil has ascertained, by rubbing the nerves of a frog so as to give them a reddish hue, from the increased quantity of blood which is directed to them. If that fluid be conveyed in some considerable quantity to the nervous sys- tem, it interrupts its functions, which happens in the brain, in cases of sanguinous apoplexies. Amongst the great number of bodies that I have opened, I have not as yet'had an opportunity of ascertaining this fact in a very positive manner.

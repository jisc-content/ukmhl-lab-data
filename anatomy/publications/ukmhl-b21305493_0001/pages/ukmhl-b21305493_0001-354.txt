212 NERVOUS SYSTEM a muscle of animal life is put in action by the irri- tation of some distant organ, by the distention of the ligaments of the foot, for instance ; this organ first acts upon the brain, which then re-acts, by means of the nerves, on the voluntary muscles, producing convulsions in them. I shall here also mention an experiment, by which I am convinced how much the cerebral and nervous influence is indispensable in the sympathies we are now examining. I cut all the nerves of one inferior extremity in divers animals. I have then irritated, in a variety of different ways, very sensible parts, as the retina, the pituitary membrane, the marrow of the bones, &c. I produced in that manner a thousand sym- pathetic phenomena ; sometimes organic contrac- tility, as vomitings, involuntary evacuations of urine, of faeces, <fcc.; at other times animal con- tractility in the muscles whose nerves had re- mained untouched : but these muscles from which they had been divided, were in no instance brought into action. I have very frequently re- peated these experiments, which would undoubt- edly have produced results, if, without the inter- ference of the brain, the nervous communications could make the muscles of nnimal life contract. I have observed, in this respect, that in experi- ments on sensibility, sympathetic phenomena have not been sufficiently attended to. I even do not believe, that these phenomena have ever been the objects of any experiments on animals,

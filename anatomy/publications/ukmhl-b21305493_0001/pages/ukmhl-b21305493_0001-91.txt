All organs are essentially contractile ; but these specific causes which occasion contraction, act only on certain tissues. Contraction alone has a general effect. SECTION vi. Remarks on the Organization of Animals. The properties whose influence we have in- vestigated, are not exactly essentially inherent in the particles of matter wherein they reside. In fact they disappear as soon as these particles lose their organic arrangement. To this arrangement they exclusively belong, and it is therefore necessary to consider it in a general point of view. All animals are compounded of various organs, each of which exercising a separate function, and in a manner peculiar to itself, concurs to the pre- servation of the whole. These organs are so many distinct and collateral machines, subordinate to the great, and general machine. Each individual machine accordingly is itself composed of several tissues differing in nature, and constituting the real elements of these organs. Chemistry has its si in-

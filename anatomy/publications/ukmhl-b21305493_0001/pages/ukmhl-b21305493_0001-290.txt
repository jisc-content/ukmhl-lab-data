NERVOUS SYSTEM 148 may be easily ascertained by comparing his work with this chapter, in which nothing will be found inserted but what is supported by strict observa- tion. I have suppressed all the theoretical ideas which Reil had associated with his facts. Two things are to be distinguished in every nervous filament. 1st. An external membrane of a tubular form, which contains the marrow. 2dly. The nervous marrow itself; each of which 1 shall treat of separately. Of the Theca or Nevrileme,* and its Origin. This membrane supplies every nervous filament with a real canal, which contains the marrow in its cavity in the same manner as veins or arteries contain the blood, except that the marrow is stationary, and the blood circulated. The origin of the theca, or nevrileme, is very conspicuous in the spinal marrow ; it is continued with the dense and thick membrane that en- clothes its white substance, and which is called the pia-mater, although it does not bear the least resemblance to the membrane of the same * Nevrileme is a word Bichat has formed from the Greek: he has introduced it in the science to express the system of the theca, and no author, I believe, has made use of it before him. As it is perfectly intelligible as French, and no other word could be sub- stituted for it in English, except that of theca, I have let it remain^ and employed them at pleasure for the same purpose.

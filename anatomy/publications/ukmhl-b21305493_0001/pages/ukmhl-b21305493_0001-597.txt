OF THE DARK BLOOD. 455 tude on the head bent backwards, is a giddiness produced by the difficulty the blood meets with in ascending against its own weight. 4th. The valves are particularly intended to counteract the force of gravitation. Every violent motion communicated to the dark blood, and, independent of gravity, may also disturb its course ; thus it happens that, after turning violently in a circular direction, a central motion, as it were, is communicated to the vein- ous blood of the brain, which, diverting it from its natural destination, and preventing it from being completely returned to the heart, produces a stagnation, and hence the vertigo that is ex- perienced. It is not only gravity and all other external causes for motion, that influence at every instant that of the blood in the veins ; but also internal and external pressures, with a variety of other mechanical causes. The fluid in arteries, on the contrary, is quite independent of the greatest part of these causes, of gravity in particular, and of the internal motion. Why is this ? because such is the rapi- dity of motion impressed by the heart on the red blood, that the influence of gravity, or of all other analogous causes, is necessarily lost. Let us make use of a simile. The greater the impulse by which a projectile is forced in an

EXHALANT SYSTEM. 663 frequently recommend bleeding in cases of he- morrhage, have thought that they were caused by plethora only, and that the vessels containing too much blood, some should be abstracted; but there are many more cases in which passive he- morrhages are not attended with the least symp- toms of plethora, than cases in which, these signs exist. Admitting that there is a real deficiency of this fluid in the large vessels, and that the ex- halants of a part by their mode of sensibility are connected with it, they would pour out blood with the same abundance as if plethora existed. It is similar in this respect to the increase of the secretions, to that of natural exhalations, &c. If plethora in the large vessels exist or not, from the moment the mode of sensibility of the secre- tory or of the exhalants is increased by the local affection, these organs attract the blood in abundance. The influence of plethora over the increase of the different fluids that are separated from the blood, is evidently a remnant of the Boerhaavian opinions. If the fluids in every part were under the influence of the heart, if the blood and serum, &c. that flow from the exhalants, the secreted fluids issuing from their tubes, were propelled by this organ, this influence of plethora would necessarily exist; but since all the fluids that arise from the capillary system are not influenced by the action of the heart,

OF THE RED BLOOD. 337 culty of respiration, frequent suffocation, cough, irregularity of the pulse, the necessity of a con- stant vertical position of the trunk, and in the last moments, with infiltration and serous effu- sions of the thorax, expectoration of blood, &c. and in which I found nothing more than the ossification of the mitral valves, less considerable than the bodies of aged subjects, daily present in our dissecting rooms. I must even acknowledge, that this natural tendency in old age of the common membrane of the veinatts system to ossify, had led me to believe that we have somewhat exaggerated the cases in which this ossification in the adult, and even in elderly subjects, when existing in these to a great degree, is considered as the cause of the whole series of phenomena, whose assem- blage, according to the greater part of phy- sicians, constitutes asthma. But the practice of the Hotel Dieu, convinces me every day, that those cases of ossification, of aneurism, and of all other affections that have their seat in the heart, form a class of disorders nearly as numerous as that of the chronic diseases of the lungs, to which before Corvisart, every symptom of disease in the chest was generally attributed.

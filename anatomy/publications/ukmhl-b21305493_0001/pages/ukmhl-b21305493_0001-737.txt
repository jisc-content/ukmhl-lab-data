595 / CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. dently form the first class; the different erup- tions, tumours, inflammations, &c. the second: but although numerous circumstances connect the latter with the former, it does not essentially pro- ceed from it, as the following* lines will prove. Fever can evidently take place only in animals possessed of large vessels, in those in which the blood is circulated in a mass; it does not there- fore occur in the zoophytes and plants that pos- sess a capillary circulation only: these inferior classes of animals, howrever, and all vegetables, are liable to every affection that is seated in the capillary circulation; thus we find a number of tumours formed on plants; thus their wounds unite ; two parts of the same contract adherences, which is proved by ingrafting. Such diseases as are seated in their capillary system certainly differ from those of animals, both in their course and nature; but they continually display the same general character, because they proceed from the same properties, namely, from organic sensibility and insensible contractility. Since the diseases of the capillary system are not essentially connected with those of the gene- ral vascular system, they do not therefore arise from them. Circulation in the first is indirectly subordinate to that of the second;â€”hence the reason why the two circulations may be divided; why more than the half of organized beings are possessed of a capillary circulation only. This is the most important, since it directly conveys

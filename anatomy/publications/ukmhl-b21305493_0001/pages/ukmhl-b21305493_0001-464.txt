VASCULAR SYSTEM 322 The following' lines prove this resistance both in the transverse and in the longitudinal sense. 1st. When a ligature has been applied on the upper part of the carotid artery, and a fluid is then in- jected, it requires a considerable degree of strength to break the texture. The very same thing is ob- served when the artery is inflated instead of in- jected. Very frequently the efforts of one man are insufficient to cause laceration : thus, the force of the heart can never occasion it suddenly ; so that the formation of aneurism only takes place by gradual and long continued action on the arterial coats ; even then I doubt if these tumours could be produced solely by the impulse of the circulating fluid against the feeble parieties of the arteries without a previous change in the arte- rial texture. 2dly. The resistance of these coats is also ascertained to exist in a longitudinal direc- tion. If the two ends of an artery and of a mus- cle be drawn in opposite directions, the first will part with more difficulty than the second, when the dead body is the subject of this comparative experiment. But in the living subject it is quite the reverse, the vessel will give way to any very considerable power: to divide the muscle would require an exertion incomparably greater. This difference is derived from the vital properties of the latter, which then violently contracts, whilst the artery can only oppose the nature of its

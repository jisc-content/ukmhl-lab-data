CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 600 does not act upon that on a level with the cup- ping-glass, raises and considerably distends the skin. Sudden changes in the atmosphere will produce over the whole body, although in a less degree, the effect of cupping. If the air be rare- fied, the whole external capillary system becomes fuller; the veins, even the sub-cutaneous ones, enlarge, and a considerable part of the blood ex- periences a disturbance in its motion between the arterial and veinous circulations. The harmony that exists between these two systems is ob- structed ; hence, weariness, the sensation of hea- viness, &c., from which we are instantly freed by a change of atmosphere. Evacuation of blood will also, although not precisely in so striking a degree, establish dis- tinctions in the capillary system. There are two methods of bleeding: the one reduces the mass of blood in the circulation of the large trunks, sometimes it is the red blood, as in alterio- tomy, but more generally it is the black that is drawn. The other extracts the blood from the capillary circulation; it is performed by the application of leeches, the cupping-glass, &c.; either will produce a different change in the course of the blood. Physicians in former times were engaged in considering which vein should be punctured. 1 believe it would be much more im- portant to know when bleeding should be directed to the general circulation; or when, on the contrary, it should act on the capillary system.

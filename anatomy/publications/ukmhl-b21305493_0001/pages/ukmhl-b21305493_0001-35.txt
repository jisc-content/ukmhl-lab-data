Properties, Functions, Developement of the Exhalant System. Sect. I.—Properties.—Those of the tissue not yet ascertained.—The organic remarkably conspicuous - 649—650 Characters of the Vital Properties.—Vary in each system Conse- quences as they relate to the functions - - 650—652 Sect. II.—Of Natural Exhalations.—All derived from the vital pow- ers.—They consequently vary, as these properties.—Proofs.—Sympa- thetic exhalations - - - 652—655 Sect.

Thus, in confining ourselves to the most rigorous observation, it is evident, that this division is the only one that can be admitted ; and, I believe, that no other can be employed until our knowledge becomes suffi- ciently extended, to authorise us in classifying them according to the causes from which they arise, and not from the results they afford. Besides, I could not too strongly recommend, to distinguish perfectly that which belongs to them, from what belongs to the natural connec- tions of functions.

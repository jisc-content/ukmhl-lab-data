CELLULAR SYSTEM. u organ, of which it constitutes a part. In many organic diseases of the liver, we meet with steato- matous tumours that give this organ a peculiar irre- gular form, and which occupying only the cellular tissue, do no prejudice to the glandular tissue, which as usual secretes the bile, whose chemical composition is unchanged. It is a very singular phenomenon, that there is often considerable derangement of structure without any distur- bance in the secretion of bile. We may compare it to changes not less remarkable, that the lungs are subject to in consumption where respiration, despite the violence of disease, is carried on with almost the same regularity as in a state of health. The tissue of certain organs is so very close, that the cellular tissue can hardly be discerned; some authors even have been inclined to deny its existence. In many of these organs however it may be made perfectly distinct by maceration, which insensibly softens and separates their fibres, as in the tendons and fibrous membranes. Boiling deprives some of their nutritious matter, gelatine for instance, and leaves a membranous residue, which is evidently cellular. In all, even bones and cartilages, &c. granulation, the production of which, as we shall find, is specifically of a cel- lular nature, proves the existence of this internal tissue, of which there are so many processes. It is the same in mollities ossium, and fungous tu- mours of other organs, diseases in which this

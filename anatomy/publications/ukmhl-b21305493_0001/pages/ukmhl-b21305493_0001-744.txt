602 CAPILLAUY SYSTEMS. as in those called white organs, the progress of their motion is very slow, because sensibility in these organs is very obscure and languid. Thus, the different tumours they contribute to form nearly always display, as we shall perceive, a chronic course. In the animal economy those tumours, com- monly called lymphatic, are frequently met with, although we are completely unacquainted with the fluids by which they are formed. They are generally produced near the articulations; but these white tumours are sometimes seated ex- clusively in cartilages, in the cellular tissue, in bones, &c. To ascertain the characters by which these are distinguished, and those in which blood is chiefly admitted, would be very advantageous. Phenomena of the Changes that the Fluids undergo in the Capillary System. We have just been examining the phenomena respecting the motion of fluids in the general ca- pillary system : let us now consider the changes they undergo in this system. The blood displays an important phenomenon in the general capillary system: from red, as in the arteries, it is converted into black. How is this phenomenon produced? It can only take place in two different ways, namely, either by an

520 VASCULAll SYSTEftf flux in the veins of the abdominal system, which are observed in the preceding, are ever seen; 2dly. Why nearly the same quantity of blood is constantly found: 3dly. Why, consequently, we never observe, either in the common trunk that corresponds to the heart, or in the branches, any of those numerous varieties of dilatation and con- traction, which are so frequently observed in the right side of the heart, and in all the large veinous trunks, so that in this respect, scarcely two subjects are found alike, whilst here it is always pretty nearly the same: 4thly. Why the liver is not subject to that immense variation of volume, which the lungs undergo. This even merits a particu- lar consideration. However few bodies we may have opened, we must have observed that this last viscus is hardly ever found twice to contain the same quantity of blood; its weight varies con- siderably in this respect. Now all this proceeds from the greater or less obstacles the fluid has ex- perienced in crossing the lungs at the moment of death. We may render it lighter or heavier in an animal, on destroying it by strangulation or hemorrhage, consequently by filling, or de- priving of blood the extremities of the pulmonary artery. On the contrary, whatever may be the cause of death, the hepatic extremities of the ab- dominal system always contain nearly the same quantity of blood; besides, admitting that at the instant of death, this system contained more than

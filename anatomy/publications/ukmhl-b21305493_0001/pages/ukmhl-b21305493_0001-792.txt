650 EXHALANT SYSTEM. Who has ever attempted to ascertain the respec- tive diameters of the vessels with the particles of the fluids? We may remark, that all these ex- pressions, thin fluids, gross fluids, &c. still made use of by many physicians, have been introduced into medical practice by this theory, and have been continued, although the theory itself has been acknowledged false. I have frequently said, and I shall again repeat, the only cause that prevents the red particles from being admitted into the vessels intended to contain the white fluids, is the want of connection between the na- ture of the fluid and the sensibility of the organ. The properties of animal life have evidently no connection with the exhalants. Amongst those of organic life, they possess the greatest degree of organic sensibility, and the correspondent insen- sible contractility. On these powers alL their functions revolve. Characters of the Vital Powers. Although organic sensibility is possessed by all the exhalants, yet it varies remarkably in each system ; that of the mucous system is not the same as that of the serous. In general, these vessels be- ing, as it were, component parts of the tissue of each system, they absolutely partake of the or- ganic properties of that system, or rather, the

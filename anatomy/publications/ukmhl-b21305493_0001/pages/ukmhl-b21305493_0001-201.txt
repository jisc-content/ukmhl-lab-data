CELLULAR SYSTEM. 59 produced in the dead body, but never takes place in the living. In short, if we expose one of the arteries of a living animal, and se- parate it distinctly from the surrounding tissue, we shall not find on examining it for what- ever space of time, that there is any oozing out of fat through its parieties, although the circula- tion of blood be carried on as usual. There are an infinite number of arteries which penetrate the cellular tissue, without ever depositing this sub- stance, as we see in the scrotum, eyelids, &o. Now in these parts the arteries are on the one hand organised as elsewhere, and on the other, fat must be formed in equal proportion in the blood that they convey, consequently, according to Haller, we must suppose that fat also trans- udes through them. Besides, we shall find in the chapter on exhalation, that this transuda- tion through the arterial pores, whatever be the fluid supposed to transude, is utterly at variance with the laws of the animal economy. I must refer to this chapter for the proofs which I have advanced, to shew the falsity of Hallerâ€™s doc- trine. We shall also find in the same chapter, that fat is separated by a process of exhalation, purely analogous to that of all other exhaled fluid, that is to say, by vessels of a peculiar or- der, intermediate between the arterial extremities and the cellular tissue. Some authors have af- fected to see distinct vessels circulating fat, and m 2

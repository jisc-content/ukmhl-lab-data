CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 552 There may indeed habitually exist in this sys- tem empty vessels, intended, in peculiar circum- stances, for receiving fluids: thus, the ureter, the excretory vessels, in some cases the lacteal orifices, during the intervals between digestion are empty. The rapidity with which the blood is conveyed into the capillary tubes of the face, and in those of the other parts of the skin, could hardly be conceived if these vessels contained a fluid to be expelled before the blood can enter : in short, nothing grounded on experience can be produced to resolve the question. Organs in which the Capillary Vessels contain no Blood. These organs are not so numerous as the pre- ceding. Such are the tendons, the cartilages, the hair, and a few ligaments, &c.; they are dissected in the living animal without the slighest effusion of blood : capillary vessels, however, exist in these parts : this is ascertained by proper injections. In inflammations they are also frequently filled with blood. In the plica polonica this fluid pe- netrates the hair; consequently, the non-vascular appearance of these organs in the living subject is illusory; it is because their fluids are divided into such very minute streams, because their cir- culation is very slowly performed and their colour is different from that of the blood, that they are imperceptible.

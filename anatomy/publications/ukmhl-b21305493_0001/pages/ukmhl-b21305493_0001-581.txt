Besides, where is the advantage of as- certaining the strict proportions, that a number of physicians have attempted to establish between our parts ? they are useless in respect to the ex- planation of the phenomena concerning health and diseases.

The same observation may in general be ap- plied to the two sides of the heart, one of which is joined to the veinous system, the other to that of the arteries. The right side is generally larger than the left, not exactly in respect to the fleshy texture, but to the fluid that distends it; this is so correct, that if in an animal whose chest is laid open, the blood, by means of liga- tures, be confined in the left side, and the right be emptied by making a few punctures, it will be reduced to a less volume than the other.

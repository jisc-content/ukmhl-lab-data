733 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. It may be said that thousands of passages are always open in our organs to admit noxious principles. Placed as a centinel at their orifice, the organic sensibility, according to the manner it is affected, warns the insensible contractility when they are to be opened or contracted. It is exhalation that contributes to form the greatest part of tumours; it is absorption that effects the cure. If I intended to follow the phenomena of ab- sorption through the different stages of life in the sexes, in the seasons and climates, I should be continually showing the differences of organic sensibility that always precede the variations of this function. I shall speak of it in respect to the different ages. The causes that alter the natural type of sensi- bility in the absorbents, are, as in respect to every other function, either direct or sympathetic. 1st. Direct, as when by friction on the skin the absorbents are excited and brought into ac- tion, which would not otherwise have been the case. 2dly. Sympathetic, as when the absorbents par- taking of the affection of a distant part increase or diminish their action accordingly as they are influenced. We have treated of this phenome- non amongst the sympathies in the different systems.

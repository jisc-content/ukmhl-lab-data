I have hitherto ascer- tained nothing in this respect. As to the pre- tended compression of the origin of the nerves by the blood which resorts to the brain or the spinal marrow, whoever has examined the connections between nerves and blood-vessels, in the basis of the cranium, will undoubtedly not admit of such compressions. Besides the greater part of the foramina, through which the small arteries pene- trate in the very interior of the viscera, have a larger calibre, so that however full they may be, they cannot be pressed against their sides. We cannot conceive a compression at the origin of the nerves, but from effusions at the basis of the cranium. Exhalants and Absorbents. These vessels baffle inspection in nerves; but nutrition bespeaks their existence. It would seem that this function is performed in the fol- lowing manner: the exhalants receive from the arteries with which they are continuous the medul- lary substance they deposit in the canal of the nevrileme, which is, if I may thus express myself, a reservatory for this substance, and which sub- stance is afterwards taken up by the absorbents. Several have thought that the theca is the se-

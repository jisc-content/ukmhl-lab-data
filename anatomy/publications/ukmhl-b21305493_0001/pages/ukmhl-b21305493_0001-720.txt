CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 578 in contact with any internal organ laid bare,â€”in wounds, for instance, &c. 2nd. By a continuity of organs ; for instance,, as when a part of the skin, the pleura, &c., are inflamed, the adjoining parts will also become affected, and the course of the blood is directed in the same manner as when an organ is diseased, and the next partakes of the morbid state, through the medium of the cellular communication. 3rd. By sympathies: thus when the skin is chilled by cold, the pleura becomes sympathe- tically affected ; its organic sensibility is increased, and the blood rushes to it from every direction. If this property be affected in the capillary system by any of these means, the resulting phe- nomena will be exactly similar ; for instance, if it be increased in the pleura, either because, from a wound in the chest, the air is admitted to the membrane, or because the lungs it envelopes have been previously affected, or finally, because the skin has been chilled when in a state of per- spiration ; the consequence is nearly similar in respect to the approach of blood in the capillary system. It is, then, the change that occurs in the or- ganic sensibility that constitutes both the essence and the principle of the disease ; it is this change that produces more or less pain in the affected part: sensibility, at first organic, becomes ani- mal ; the part was previously sensible to the

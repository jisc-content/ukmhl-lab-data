601 CAPILLARY SYSTEM Si, 111 numerous cases of local obstruction, it does not follow that we reduce the quantity of blood in a part of the capillary system by diminishing the mass of this fluid in the large trunks, admitting even there is a fourth part less in the economy* If a part has been irritated, the same quantity will flow to that part. On the contrary, if we double, by transfusion, the quantity of blood in an animal, local inflammations will not ensue, because, to occasion a flux of blood in a particular part of the capillary system requires a previous irrita- tion. x The fluids distinct from the blood, that are cir- culated in the capillary system, 1st. Are like that evidently independent of the influence of the heart. 2dly. Their motion is governed by the tonic powers. 3dly. These are, consequently, liable to undergo irregular oscillations, accord- ingly as the capillary vessels are differently af- fected. We are ignorant of the greatest part of these fluids, because it is impossible to submit them to our experiments. It is with these, that the ligaments, tendons, aponeurosis, hair, the carti- lage, fibro-cartilage, part of the serous, mucous, and cutaneous surfaces, &c., are permeated: they communicate with the blood from whence they arise in the capillary systems, and are then circulated in their own.

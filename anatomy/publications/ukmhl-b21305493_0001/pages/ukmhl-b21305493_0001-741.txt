capillary systems. 599 fluid in winter. There are, then, constant varie- ties in the mode of circulation through the general capillary system ; each system transmitting, in turn, more or less of this fluid accordingly as it is affected. When we see the glands frequently secrete in a very short space of time a considerable quantity of fluid, and those of the serous, cutaneous, and mu- cous exhalants, &c., are much more abundant than in the natural state, we are surprised how circula- tion can at the same time be carried on with the same precision ; and not less so when, on the contrary, we find all the evacuations suppressed, the animal solids secreting nothing: now, in all these cases, it is the capillary system whose pow- ers, variously modified in the different parts, re- establish the general type, which would unavoid- ably be lost if the heart were the impulsive agent that expels the exhaled and secreted fluids, and propels the dark blood in the veins. Sometimes, however, almost a general de- rangement takes place in the capillary system, particularly on the surface of the body; it is caused by the sudden changes of the atmosphere ; although the vital laws actually preside over ca- pillary circulation, yet the degree of compression from the surrounding air may, in some measure, modify this circulation : this is proved by cupping, or by any other means that produce a sudden vacuum upon the body; the fluids then pressed in the surrounding parts by the external air, which

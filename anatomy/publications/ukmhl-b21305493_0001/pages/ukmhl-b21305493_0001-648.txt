60 6 VASCULAR SYSTEM which circulation is performed in the veins in which the fluid imperfectly moved from a want of power in the capillary system, is disposed to stagnate, and even to dilate their parieties, as I have previously stated; thus it might happen that a less quantity of dark blood being returned from the organs, more might still be found in the veins than in those of the adult: this would pro- ceed from the rapidity of the circulation being di- minished. Then what takes place in respect to a single case of varix, that, for instance, in which the fluid accumulates because its progression is slower, would be extended throughout the whole system. It is not then requisite to believe that the superabundance of the dark blood in old age implies a real plethora, as that existing in the red blood of the infant, in which the arteries contain more fluid, and the blood is propelled writh greater energy. From this we may perceive that the dilatation of the veins in old age is a further proof in support of the principles before stated, namely, that the capacity is constantly in a re- verse proportion to the rapidity of the fluids that circulate through them. May I be allowed a simile, in some degree imperfect, but which may tend to elucidate what takes place in the veinous system : when the bed of a river is very wide above a bridge, it flows gently ; but this being much confined under the arches, the rapidity of its course is considerably increased, that an equili-

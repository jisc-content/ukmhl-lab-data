It is sometimes said, that the extremities of nerves become callous: a vague expression in- deed, to which we have never been able to attach the least sense. When will medical language be no longer an index of the defect and incorrect- ness of the hypotheses of which it was formerly composed ? The greater part of these hypotheses have passed away, and yet almost all the ex- pressions to which they have given birth still remain. In old age, the nervous system and the brain lose in advance a part of their functions: from this proceeds hemiplegia, which at this age is almost as frequently met with as convulsions, their opposites, are in the infant. These senile hemiplegias must be distinguished from those which affect the adult; they are of the same na- ture as the senile cecity and deafness, the disÂ« tinction rests only in the injury to sensation, or to motion.

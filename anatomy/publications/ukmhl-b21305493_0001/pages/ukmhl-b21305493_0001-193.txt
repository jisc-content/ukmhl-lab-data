CELLULAR SYSTEM. 51 will give rise to a considerable increase of bulk: as inaction, rest, violent hemorrhages, and con- valescence after certain acute diseases, in which, although the living powers are not quite restored, adipose substance already abounds; 4thly, when- ever muscles are loaded with fat, they are mani- festly in a state of actual debility ; 5thly, I have frequently convinced myself on examining limbs in a state of atrophy, that the little bulk they preserve is partly owing to the fat which they contain, and which is comparatively almost equal to that of the healthy organs, while all the other parts are shrunk and wasted, parti- cularly the muscles. Castration, which deprives the vital powers of part of their activity, and nutrition of part of its energy, is very frequently attended with excessive corpulence; 7thly, on the other hand, as generation requires a certain degree of developement in the vital powers, cor- pulent subjects being deprived of such a degree of energy, are generally unfitted for this function; in the female this is -a very remarkable fact, and not less so in the man. The same observation applies to animals. In proportion as fowls are fattened for our meals they become less fit for laying eggs; the greater number of domestic animals are subject to the same law. We might suppose that there is a strong and uni- form relation existing between the secretion of semen and deposition of fat, and that these

CAPILLARY systems. 579 impression of blood, but did not convey that impression to the brain. In this last instance it does, and that sensation is painful. If in a living animal the pleura, in a healthy state, be irritated, it gives no signs of pain ; but if this membrane, on the contrary, be irritated when inflamed, it will produce the most acute pain. Are we not perfectly aware, that, in general, more or less pain is felt in an inflamed part before it becomes red? Now this sensation bespeaks a change of organic sensibility; it may even exist some time without producing any effect: this, which is owing to the afflux of blood, is con- secutive. It is the same in respect to heat. I shall state hereafter how it is produced. It is sufficient here to say, that, similar to the passage of the blood in the capillary system, a consequence only of the organic sensibility. Now, this is evident; since in every case it is subsequent to this change. The very reverse, then, to what Boerliaave had supposed takes place in inflammation. In fact, according to this author, the blood accumulated in the capillary vessels, and propelled by the heart a tergo, as he used to term it, was the actual and immediate cause of inflammation, whilst, from what I have stated, it is only the effect. However little we reflect upon the innumerable causes that may alter the organic sensibility of the capillary system, the astonishing variations

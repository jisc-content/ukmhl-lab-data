OEliLtLAK SYSTEM. si observation is verified, by comparing the cellular substance, which is found in considerable masses about the heart, the large arterial vessels, eye, womb, bladder, the large joints, as in the axilla, &c., to that external to tendons, fasciae, bones, &c., this is generally very rare. The extension and compression of which its cells admit, gives it the power of adapting itself to the extensive motions of the organs, particularly to those of dilatation and contraction, that are facilitated besides by the fluids it contains. Those organs, on whose ex- ternal surface very little cellular substance is dis- coverable, and which execute many motions, as the stomach, intestines, and brain, &c., are fur- nished with serous membranes, for the supply of this defect. These membranes, and the cellular tissue, are, in fact, the two great and sole means that nature has provided organs with, for the facility of their motions. There are certain organised parts possessing scarcely any motion, and surrounded nevertheless with a large quantity of cellular substance : we see a striking instance of this in the kidneys. The testis, and its membranes, are also buried in an accumulation of it; the thyroid gland is plenti- fully supplied therewith, as also the pancreas and salivary glands, which are separated by the limits it forms from the neighbouring organs. In ge- neral, almost all immoveable parts, notwithstand- ing the unimportance of their functions, when they t

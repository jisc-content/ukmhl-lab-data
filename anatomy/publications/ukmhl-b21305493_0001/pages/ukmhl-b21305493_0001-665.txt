Several authors perceiving that the volume of this organ is enormous, when compared with the fluid it emits, have suspected that it is intended for other uses besides that of separating the bile. This suspicion seems to me a certainty. In fact, if we compare the excretory canals and the hepatic reservoirs to the same organs in the kidnies, the sa- livary glands, and even in the pancreas, we shall find they do not exceed them, that they are even inferior to those of the former ; then compare the mass of the liver with that of the loins, of the salivary glands, &c. and we shall perceive the dif- ference. If on the other hand we examine the bile that is expelled with the faeces, if the intestines be opened at the different periods of digestion, as I have done to ascertain the quantity of this fluid they contain; if we starve an animal in order that it may accumulate separately in the intes- tines ; if the ductus choledochus be tied to re- tain the bile, &c. it will be impossible not to be s s2

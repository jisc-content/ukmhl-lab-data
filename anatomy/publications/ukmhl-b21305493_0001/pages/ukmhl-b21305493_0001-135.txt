XCV GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS, are alike in respect to their parenchyma, or at least they bear the strongest analogy to each other. If it were possible to deprive parts of their nutritive matter without injuring the pa- renchyma, we should detect varieties in forms, in bulk, in the intermixture of the layers of cellular membrane, in the vascular or nervous branches, but not a single shade of difference in their nature or composition. At an early period of conception, the mucous mass which the foetus presents, appears to be nothing else but a compound of the general sys- tems. Each organ is as yet endowed with no more than its nutritive parenchyma, which nature has moulded into the shape of the organ about to be developed. As this pulp increases and expands, the nutritive substances penetrate it, and every organ, until then resembling the others in its nature, and forming with them one homogeneous mass, begins to assume a distinct character, and enters into a distinct existence; thus each borrows from the blood the substance fitted to its growth. This addition endues it with the properties of bulk, density, &c., but the increase of the parenchyma, and its tendency to extend itself, are always an- terior to it. Whilst inorganic bodies increase by the addition of particles, there exists originally in these an expansive power, from which, length and breadth naturally proceed, and afterwards ex- VÂ°L. 1. h

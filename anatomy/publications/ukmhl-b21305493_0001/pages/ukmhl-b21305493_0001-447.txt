OF THE RED BLOOD. 305 the trachea, and by means of a syringe adapted to the opening, the air be suddenly withdrawn from the lungs, that organ is instantly reduced to a very small volume; the vessels must then be rendered very tortuous, and yet, I have noticed, that in this case the blood continues for a con- siderable lapse of time to flow with the same force from the artery as before: 4thly. After having opened the abdomen of a living animal, I have alternately folded and extended the me- sentery, in which several arteries had previously been opened; no difference in respect to the current of blood was observable in either of these instances. Let us conclude from these experiments, that the direction of arteries does not influence the course of the blood so considerably as is com- X monly believed, and that all the speculations of mathematical physicians, in respect to obstructed circulation proceeding from this cause, have no solid foundation. Undoubtedly, when the fore arm is strongly bent the pulse is weakened, or even stopped, and to take care that the arm be extended, is a precaution that should not be neg- lected in feeling the pulse of a patient; but this phenomenon does not proceed from the curve of the artery, it is caused by the fleshy parts, which by their pressure, lessen, and even obliterate its canal. This is so correct, that the different cur- vatures of the internal carotid are much more

266 OF ORGANIC LIFE. SECTION II. Course, Termination, Plexus. The nerves having proceeded from the gan- glions are disposed different ways, which will now be considered. 1st. There are always some that instantly pro- ceed to the system of animal life. The ophthalmic ganglion sends branches to the common motors, and to the nasal nerves with its ramifications. The spheno-palatine sends communicating branches to the superior maxillary nerve ; the superior cervical to every surrounding nerve ; namely, above to the external motor; inwardly, to the great hypo- glossal, to the par-vagum, to theglosso-pharyngeal, to the spinal, &c.; backwards, to the first cer- vical pairs. All the ganglions, placed the one above the other along the vertebral column, send communicating branches to every pair from the foramena with which they correspond. The par- vagum communicates with the semi-lunar, &c.; then there actually does not exist a single gan- glion from the nerves of animal life. From thence is derived the expression habitually made use of, indicating that a ganglion proceeds from such or such a pair, or is found in their course, expres- sions that are very incorrect. Thus, the ophthal- VOL. i. B B

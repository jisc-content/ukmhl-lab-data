014 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. similar to the latter, they invariably display a previous discordance in the vital powers. Let chemists apply their theories to these morbid changes of heat, and they must necessarily find an insurmountable obstacle, whilst, in regarding this phenomenon as I have represented, these changes are the necessary consequence of the state of the vital powers at the moment. After running swiftly, or when the blood is excessively agitated during fever, more caloric is formed than at any other time. Does this prove that the ' general circulation is intended for its production, and that it takes place in the large vessels ? No, no more than in the same case, the abundance of perspiration proves it is expelled by the heart. The capillary and the exhaling sys- tems being strongly excited by the impetus of the red blood suddenly increased, their action is increased ; and from these two effects result, 1st. More heat is disengaged; 2dly. The exhalation is increased. If heat be increased when respiration is more rapid, it appears to proceed from the circum- stance of this being hardly ever accelerated with- out the other being equally so. This assertion is so perfectly correct, that if inspiration and respi- ration be continued in more rapid succession for some time, the temperature is not thereby in- creased ; besides, why should heat be actually increased by the rapidity of respiration ?

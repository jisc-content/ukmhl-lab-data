84 CELLULAR SYSTEM. name of sensible organic contractibility, by others denominated tonicity, &c. The connections between the cellular and the other systems, are numerous and multiplied ; but they are not easily detected. In effect, as it is diffused throughout the different organs, and con- stitutes a portion of their structure, it is difficult to distinguish its properties from those of the parts with which it is mingled. These con- nexions, nevertheless, are clearly manifested in certain conditions, in acute affections for instance, as well as chronic diseases, it is peculiarly suscep- tible of the morbid influence of other organs. I would not be understood to speak of such changes as arise from contiguity, or continuity of parts, which, as I have shewed, are sufficiently common, but I advert strongly to those that take place in particular divisions of the cellular tissue, that have no known or acknowledged connexion with the organ affected. In those acute diseases that are seated in a particular organ, as the lungs, stomach, or intes- tines, the cellular tissue is frequently affected by the laws of sympathy, it becomes the seat of inflammations, sinuses, &c. Critical abscesses in general, are dependent upon the real though unknown relation that subsists between organs af-

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 6 must therefore mould themselves to bodies, seize, grasp, and hold them. This closeness of texture, is a substantial reason why they do not swell like other parts in dropsies, and preserve their natural appearance, although the rest of the sub-cutaneous tissue has been filled for a considerable period with fluid. I saw two subjects affected with elephanteasis, who had the whole of the integu- ments and the subjacent tissue of the inferior extremities enormously swollen, except in the sole of the foot; the contrast that this part ex- hibited in its natural state, with the back swelled to an astonishing bulk, gave the foot that peculiar aspect which has been noticed by authors. The texture of the sub-cutaneous cellular mem- brane is dense about the capsular ligaments, for which reason the adhesion of the skin is stronger : hence those contractions we observe at these parts in the extremities of infants, very little fat being admitted into the condensed cells. The sub-cutaneous cellular tissue fulfils many purposes. From it the skin borrows the great* freedom of motion it enjoys over the organ it covers,and which is particularly observable in the muscular action of the extremities and trunk, in the shocks that the skin receives from outward bodies, in the different tumors that attain any conside- rable size, as in sarcocele, which is frequently covered at the expence of the integuments of the penis, the lower part of the abdomen and thigh ;

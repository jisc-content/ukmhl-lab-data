It is in the brain, that the immediate cause of apoplexy exists, and animal life is in consequence speedily interrupted; when also, the attack is violent, the brain having lost the power of acting upon the intercostal muscles, their movements are stopped, the mechanical, and then the chemical actions cease, the circulation cannot go on, and organic life is destroyed. It may then be per- ceived, that in all the phenomena of such affec- tions, the injury sustained by one organ, induces, by a natural consequence, the suspension of action in the others. In sympathies it is quite different. Thus, the functions of the skin being suspended, sometimes the lungs, sometimes the stomach, or the intes- tines, may partake of the injury and become af- fected : These sympathetical phenomena may or may not take place; on the contrary, what- ever may be the cerebral, pulmonary, or cardiac actions that are disturbed, it is impossible that the others should not be affected in consequence.

ABSOKBANT SYSTEM. 688 the thoracic duct and the absorbents, and the very same subject has probably experienced, during life, all these varieties. If in the same subject life could be frequently re-produced and annihilated, the variations of the veinous and absorbant systems would probably be as nu- merous. From these considerations, it is seen how use- less have been all those idle comparisons of pro- portions between the capacity of vessels with which books on physiology are crowded. If the assemblage of the veins be compared with that of the absorbents, from what I have just stated, it is certainly very difficult to obtain any accurate information, but some approxi- mation might be admitted. Now the absorb- ents do not appear much inferior to the veins: for instance, the sum of the lymphatic vessels in the inferior extremities, compared wTith the capa- city of the veinous trunks, is not much less. It is the same in every other part, the veins being larger, but the absorbents more numerous, the disproportion is not very material. From this, it would appear, there should be no great difference between the trunks in which the veins terminate, and those which form the boun- dary of the exhalant system ; this difference how- ever, as we shall see, is enormous.

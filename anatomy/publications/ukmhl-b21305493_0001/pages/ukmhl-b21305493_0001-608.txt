I 466 VASCULAR SYSTEM In those parts where each cerebral vein opens into a sinus, the common membrane of this sinus penetrates its tube, and lines it to its most dis- tant parts. I have heard of no author, who had thus considered the cerebral sinuses as presenting the common membrane of the dark blood, ex- tended in the separation of the dura-mater. If the internal surface of a sinus is ever so slightly examined, it is still easily seen, that this surface differs as much from the tissue of the dura-mater as it approaches the appearance of the internal surface of veins. The cerebral veins that reach the sinuses are, by the excessive tenuity of their parieties, analo- gous with the arteries in that region; a tenuity apparently proceeding from the absence of the cellular covering, and which is such, that it might induce us to suppose it is only the common mem- brane. Circular fibres are never met with in veins. Common Membrane of the Dark Blood. This membrane, extended from the general ca- pillary system to that of the lungs, is every where nearly of the same nature, it essentially differs from that of the red circulation in a great variety of particulars. 1st.

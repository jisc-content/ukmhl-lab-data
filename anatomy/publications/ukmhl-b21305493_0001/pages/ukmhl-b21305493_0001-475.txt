333 OF THE UE1) BLOOD. a se])arate texture in the economy, a texture ex- clusively possessed of distinctive characters. When the common membrane of arteries under- goes dessication separately, it is much more sup- ple than the other. Instead of acquiring the deep hue of this last, it retains its transparency. In respect to the phenomena of the other re-actives, excepting the contraction, they arc nearly the same. Amongst all organic systems, this membrane is particularly remarkable for its singular tendency to ossify in old age. I can affirm that out of ten subjects, seven, at least, after the age of sixty, will present instances of such incrustation. These incrustations, which are never connected with the peculiar fibrous membrane, always commence on its external surface, which is the part prin- cipally affected, for there always remains on the incrustation a kind of slight pellicle, that se- parates it from the blood, and which belongs to the membrane ; the calcareous substance ,is never found in contact with the circulating fluid. Such incrustations in no respect follow the com- mon rules of ossification. They are very seldom preceded by the formation of cartilage. The sa- line substance is instantly deposited on the exter- nal part of the common membrane by means of the exhalants. It is always by insulated layers, more or less extensive, that this exhalation is per- formed ; the whole of the artery seldom forms a

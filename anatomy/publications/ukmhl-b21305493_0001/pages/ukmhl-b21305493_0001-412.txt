NERVOUS SYSTEM 270 tissue; they follow its course without visibly in- termixing with each other. 2dly. The others form, as it were, a new tunic exterior to the former, adhering intimately, and so intermixed, that they might be mistaken for a real theca sur- rounding the artery. When the artery runs but a short distance, these two orders of branches remain perfectly dis- tinct from each other till they reach the organ, as may be seen round the splenic, the hepatick, the renal, &c.; but if its course be more extensive, the exterior branches gradually pass into the ar- terial plexus, where they are totally lost. This plexus may be followed on the large trunks; it divides at every branch and is still apparent; but such is its tenuity on the ramifications that it is completely lost: the spermatic is amongst those arteries in which it can be distinguished at the greatest distance. The arteries of the limbs do not appear to be provided with them: in gene- ral, it is upon the arteries which resort to the central organs of interior life that this net work is the most obvious. If we deduct from the sum total of the filaments proceeding from the ganglions, those by means of which they com- municate on the one part with each other, on the other part with those which resort to the nerves of animal life, it will be found that the re- mainder are ultimately intended to accompany the arteries. This disposition is quite the reverse

352 VASCULAR SYSTEM Examined in the first point of view, contrac- tility is much more striking than extensibility. Whenever the artery ceases to be distended by the blood, it evidently contracts. To this con- traction, the following phenomena must be re- ferred. 1st. The umbilical artery and the arterial canal become, after birth, by the adherence of their walls that have contracted, a kind of liga- ments. 2dly. If a ligature be applied to an artery, the whole part included between this ligature and the first collateral branch soon displays the same phenomenon, which is proved by the operation of aneurism. 3dly. If a part of the carotid be included between two ligatures, and the fluid be then drawn by a puncture, it will instantly be re- duced to half its diameter. 4thly. In dogs, into which I had transfused blood to produce artificial plethor, I have observed, that the diameter of the arteries was nearly double that which these ves- sels presented in dogs of the same size, and which I had bled profusely. If two animals of the same size be killed, the one by bleeding, the other by strangulation, they will afford the same distinc- tion. 5thly. These experiments no longer per- mit me to doubt, in respect to one of the causes for an elevated or a reduced pulse, causes that are also admitted by most physiologists. 6thly. However few may be the bodies we have opened, we must undoubtedly have been astonished to find, that in those of a similar stature the arteries

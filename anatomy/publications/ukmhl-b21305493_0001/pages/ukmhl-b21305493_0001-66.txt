GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XXVI them. This fire is the symbol of vital properties ; as long as it burns life is sustained ; but extinguish it, and life ceases with it. It is, then, a part of the essence of these properties to animate nature only for a certain space, and this comprises the neces- sary limits of life. On the contrary, the physical properties being inherent in matter, never forsake it. Accordingly inert substances have no other limits to their existence but those assigned them by chance. Nutrition is unceasingly employed in conveying the particles of inanimate bodies to those en- dowed with life, and vice versa. We can thus easily conceive how matter is and has been con- stantly acted upon by physical properties in the immense cycle of ages. These properties took possession of them at the very instant of creation, if I may be allowed the expression, and will only forsake them when the world ceases to exist. In passing from time to time through the living bodies, during the space which separates these two epochs, space measured by immensityâ€”in pass- ing, I say, through the living bodies, matter was penetrated at different intervals with the vital properties, which are found in combination with the physical ones. There is then a wide dif- ference in matter with respect to these two kinds of properties : some it enjoys only for an inde- finite period, others it possesses in secula secu- lorum. I might add to these considerations numberless

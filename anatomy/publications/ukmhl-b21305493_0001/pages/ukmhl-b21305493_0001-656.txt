514 VASCULAR SYSTEM This common trunk soon divides again into several branches, which plunge into the liver by numerous ramifications, which are lost in the tissue of that organ. It displays then the same general arrangement as the preceding, being composed of two trees, united in their opposed summits, which are inter- mixed. Suppose a fleshy impulsive organ in these summits, and it will be perfectly similar. The blood moves from one capillary system to another: first divided in very minute threads it unites into a mass which gradually increases till it reaches a fixed point, then divides again, and is lost in imperceptible streams like the former. In the abdominal portion, the ramifications, branches, and trunks follow nearly the same order as in the general veinous system: the rami- fications are situate in the organs, the largest in the interstices that separate them ; the greatest part of the branches, placed between the lamellae of the peritoneum, attend the arteries in these parts, and the trunks wind through the subjacent cellular tissue. In respect to the hepatic part, completely immerged in the liver, it is divided there nearly in the same manner. In this system anastomosis display the following disposition : 1st. The hepatic portion apparently has none ; all the branches and ramifications pur- sue separate courses. As the circulation in the liver is not liable to undergo alternate increase or

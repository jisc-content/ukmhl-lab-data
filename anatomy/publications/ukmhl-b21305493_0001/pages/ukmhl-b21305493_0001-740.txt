CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 698 total. This principle is so evident a result of all the phenomena of the economy, that I consider it unnecessary to bring forward proofs in support of it. Now admitting this as an indisputable fact, it is evident that when, in any part whatever of the capillary system its action is increased, at the expense of the other parts, the whole mass of blood, transmitted by the arteries to the veins, always remains nearly the same. Every system, then, acts, as it were, in this respect, as an aux- iliary to another. If nothing be conveyed through the capillary tubes of the one, it is of no conse- quence if the vessels of another transmit twice the quantity of fluid compared with that in their na- tural state. If we consider the blood in the capillary vessels of the skin, previous to the accession of intermit- tent fever, it has forsaken these vessels as it were ; the surfaces, previously coloured, become pale, but the capillary vessels of the other systems make up for the temporary deficiency. W ho can tell if, under numerous circumstances in which the skin is highly coloured; if, when this mem- brane is permeated with a large quantity of blood, there is not in the other systems a paleness analo- gous to that of the skin, during the cold fit of fevers ? I not only consider this as highly pro- bable, but even do not suppose it admits of a doubt. The external capillary vessels certainly contain more blood in the summer season, whilst those of the internal organs receive more of this

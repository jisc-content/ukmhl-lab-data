VASCULAR SYSTEM 308 Anastomosis of the Arteries in their Courses. # Anastomosis implies the union of several branches,by which the columns of blood are formed into a single stream. There are two modes of anastomosis. Sometimes two equal trunks are united, on other occasions a large trunk is joined to a smaller branch. In the first mode there are three varieties; 1st. Two equal trunks are some- times united in an acute angle, to form but one: it is thus, that, in the foetus, the arterial canal and the aorta are confounded with each other, that the two vertebral arteries give rise to the basilbary, &c. &c.; 2dly. Two trunks communi- cate in particular parts by a transverse branch, such are the two anterior cerebrals before they immerge from between the hemispheres; 3dly. Two trunks inosculate to form a single arch, such are the mesenteric, and then the branches arise from the convex part of the arch. From this we may perceive, that of the three modes of anastomosis between branches of equal descriptions, there is one in which two columns of blood unite and take a medium course with respect to their original position; another, in which two columns, after uniting, continue in their original course ; finally, a third, in which two columns proceeding in opposite directions meet at their extremities, and from which the blood afterwards issues through secondary vessels.

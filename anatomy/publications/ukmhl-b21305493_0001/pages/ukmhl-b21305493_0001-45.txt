V general considerations. fascinated alike all the spirits of his age, and wrought in physiological sciences a revolution akin to that which the vortices of Descartes in- troduced in the sciences of natural philosophy. His exalted and illustrious name, and the capti- vating qualities that were combined with it, se- cured to this revolution an empire which was long mouldering to decay, though undermined in all parts of its weak and dangerous foundations. Less brilliant than profound, rich in those ar- guments, that convince the understanding, with- out the sophistry that deceives the imagination, Stahl formed for physiological sciences an epoch more worthy of remark than that of Boerhaave. He felt the want of harmony between the phy- sical laws and the functions of animals ; and it was the first step towards the dicovery of the vital laws. This discovery, however, he did not make. The soul was every thing to him in the pheno- mena of life ; it was something, however, to have laid aside attraction, impulsion, &c. Stahl felt what was not the truth, but the truth escaped his notice. Several authors have followed him in referring to one sole principle, variously called by authors, every vital phenomenon. This prin- ciple, termed vital by Barthez, archaeus by Van- helmont, &c. is an assumption as void of truth as to suppose one sole acting principle govern- ing all the phenomena of physics. Amongst the latter some are derived from gravity, others from elasticity, and others from affinity, &c. So

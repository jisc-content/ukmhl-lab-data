612 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. mine the feet of birds, in which these white parts only exist: they are much colder than the re- mainder of the body. The different degrees of heat in each system, situate internally, has not yet been analyzed. I am convinced that, if this were done with pre- cision, separating such as admit of it, so as to let them communicate through the vessels, it would be found that each emits a different quan- tity of caloric, that consequently, in the general temperature, there are as many partial degrees of heat as there are organized systems. I am convinced that ligaments, cartilages, &c. approach, in this respect, the organs of cold blooded animals; and that if the human being were composed of organs similar to these, his temperature would be very much inferior to what it is naturally. The systems in which more calo- ric is formed, supply with this fluid those which possess less. If the hair were situate within the body, it would be as warm as the surrounding parts, although possessed of an independent tem- perature ; it always remains inferior to that of the body, because it is separated from it. Each system then has its peculiar mode of heat, in the same manner as each gland has its peculiar mode of secretion; each exhaling surface, its peculiar mode of exhalation, each tissue its peculiar mode of nutrition, and all this directly proceeds from

The uterus in the aged female, would be nothing more than a mass of cicatrises, if rup- ture took place during menstruation. 5thly. In active hemorrhage, in which there evidently exists a previous congestion of blood, the laceration of these minute vessels might be supposed ; but in passive hemorrhage, in those in which the organic sensibility is annihilated, seems to admit only of a transudation through the exha- lantsâ€”how could such lacerations be conceived ? 6thly. How an evacuation frequently produced with the utmost rapidity, subsiding in one part, and instantly re-produced in another, liable to every sympathetic influence, could be produced by laceration, is difficult to conceive. 7thJy. Menstruation sometimes continues for a few moments, and then ceases, and in particular affections, these alternate changes occur twenty or thirty times a day; it would then require that the wounds should re-open and be cicatrised at every change. 8thly. Besides, if we compare the hemorrhages evidently produced by a laceration of the mucous surfaces, as those which in wounds on the head, pro- ceed from the nostrils, the ears, &c., those which from a fall on the buttock will sometimes proceed

EXHALANT SYSTEM. 653 rated ; it is there converted from red into black; its different elements are separated, combined anew, and in the changes they undergo their caloric is suffered to escape. It is subsequent to these alterations, these different transformations, that each bxhalant claims and selects, as it were, the parts with which its sensibility is connected, and rejects the rest. From hence it follows, that whenever the organic sensibility of a system in which exhalation takes place is altered, the ex- haled fluid must also varyâ€”an effect that is con- stant. There is never any derangement in the process of exhalation, without a preceding one in the sensibility of the vessels. Let us, for instance. take the changes of transpiration, and we shall find that cold, heat, dryness, humidity, friction, &c.y always exert an influence upon the cutaneous sensibility, and that the derangements of exhala- tion are merely consecutive. The organic sensibility in the exhalants, as well as that in every other part, may be variously affected. 1st. By a direct stimulant, such as when cold causes the skin to contract, or when an excessive cold beverage acts upon the stomach, &c. 2dly. Through sympathies, as when the acute affection of the fibrous and muscular organs pro- duces perspiration in a rheumatic complaint. 3dly. The vital powers in a part are often dis- turbed without our being able to account for it,

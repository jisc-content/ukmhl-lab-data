lxxviii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. quently occur to the man of genius who studies physiology ; but that it might be made the basis of a methodical classification. It was neces- sary to this classification, I remarked, that all functions should be previously referred to two grand classes, the first relating to the individual, the second to the species; that these two classes had no other connections between them but the common bond which unites all the phenomena of living bodies; but that numberless properties distinguished them in such an eminent degree, that it would be impossible to separate them. These two first classes being accurately deter- mined, and their boundaries fixed by nature, I sought to divide each into orders equally natural: this was no difficult task in the functions relating to the individual. In fact, the general doctrine, both of Aristotle and Buffon, &c., was here evi- dently admissible, but could not be applied in a general manner; it remained as a matter of importance, carefully to decide the nature and relations of the functions peculiar to each order. I call animal life, that order of functions which connects us with surrounding bodies ; signifying thereby, that this order belongs only to animals ; that it is superadded in them to those it shares with vegetables ; and finally, that it is this ex- cess of functions which forms the line of de- marcation between these two parts of the creation. I call organic life, that order which is

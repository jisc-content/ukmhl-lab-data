It appears that the liver always separates a certain quantity, which is however increased during digestion. 2nd. The bile furnished during abstinence is shared between the intestine, continually dyed with it, and the gall bladder, that retains it with- out pouring any part through the cystic canal; and, in this case, it acquires a deep hue, and an acrid character, without doubt necessary for the digestion that is to follow. 3rd. When the food, having been digested by the stomach, passes into the duodenum, the whole quantity of bile which, till then, was divi- ded, flows into the intestine, and even in greater quantity. On the other hand, the gall bladder also pours that which it contained on the alimen- tary pulp, which is thus completely imbued with this fluid. 4th. After the intestinal digestion is completed, the hepatic bile lessens, and begins to flow partly into the duodenum, and partly to reflow into the gall bladder, where on being examined it is found

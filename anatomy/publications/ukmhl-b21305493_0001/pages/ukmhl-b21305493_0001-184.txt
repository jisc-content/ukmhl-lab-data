CliLLULAtt SYSTEM. 42 one that is not natural to them. I have never found a drop of fluid in the cellular membrane of animals immediately after drinking. I have submitted several dogs to the experiment, after having deprived them for a length of time of water, and then compelled them to drink a great quantity. The cellular tissue about the stomach and intestines, and particularly that part behind the mesentery which communicates with the pelvis at the seat of the bladder, having been attentively examined, has appeared to me to contain no fluid ; it was precisely analogous to that of other parts of the body. Besides, as we shall ascertain hereafter, these phenomena admit of a more natural explanation. It is evident then, that the cellular tissue is only permeable to fat and lymph, and rarely in any unusual degree in the ordinary state. These two fluids remain in their cells until they are re- moved, or rather resumed by absorption, and are never seen to proceed from the one to the other, but are, if I may so express myself, stagnant. It is only in serous infiltrations, in collections of pus, in a word, it is only in a morbid slate, that the permeability of the cellular tissue evinces itself. We can only then regard the cellular tissue as a reservoir for the formation of fat and serum. After death, the cellular tissue affords a quick passage to fluids, which not only penetrate into the different openings of communication between

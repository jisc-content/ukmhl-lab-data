83 CELLULAR SYSTEM. mentitious fluids, that inflammation is frequently the immediate result, but such a case is never followed by absorption. Amongst extraneous fluids, water injected is absorbed. Wine, and all other stimulating fluids, excite suppuration, , and are expelled with the pus. It is well known, that in the operation for hydrocele, abscesses of the scrotum frequently arise from the accidental passage of the injection into the cellular tissue. Experiments on living animals perfectly accord with this fact. All other stimulating fluids, di- luted acids, alcaline solutions, &c. will produce the same phenomenon. The existence of insensi- ble organic contractility is indisputably proved in the cellular tissue, by the processes of exha- lation and absorption taking place there. It is a well known fact, that the scrotum contracts in a remarkable manner on the application of cold, that it undergoes different degrees of contraction and relaxation, according as it is stimulated or remains in a natural state; that it contains no- thing else but cellular substance under the skin, whose filaments, it is true, have a peculiar as- pect, and appear to differ in their nature from those of the other parts of this system. This con- traction certainly bears no comparison with that of the muscles ; but undoubtedly it is its first de- gree ; it is of the same nature, or rather it is intermediate between them and those insensible oscillations, which are best designated by the

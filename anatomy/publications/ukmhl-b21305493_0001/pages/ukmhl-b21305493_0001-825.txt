ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 683 proportion to the size of the vessels. The flexures of the absorbents, on the contrary, are large ; when they are not straight, they are seen to twine in large folds over the extremities; viewed inter- nally, the absorbents are not always perfectly cylindrical. When injected, they frequently dis- play knobs, which undoubtedly proceed, in a great measure, from the valves. Several others have represented them as a succession of contractions ; this, however, is only correct to a certain de- gree. Those I have frequently met with in living animals, in dogs in particular, were visible dilata- tions, a kind of vesicles, occupying the course of a lymphatic, and containing serum. It was on the concave surface of the liver, and on the ve- sicles, that I have most frequently made these observations. On puncturing these vesicles with a lancet, the fluid passes out, and they instantly disappear. On trying experiments with other views, I once saw two or three of these small dilatations near the gall-bladder ; having dropped the liver to examine the intestines, I was much astonished, shortly after, to find them no more: they had disappeared undoubtedly from the con- traction of the vessel. I have remarked in this respect, that the liver is the organ in which these kinds of vessels are better ascertained in living animals ; but at the very moment the abdomen is opened, the concave surface must be examined, 3 e 2

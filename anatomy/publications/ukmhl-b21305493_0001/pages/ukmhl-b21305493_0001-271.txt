OF ANIMAL LIFE. 129 evident that the nerves do not arise deep in the cerebral substance, at least apparently, but that they take their origin from the external surface of this lnombyanc. Several physiologists, however, have admitted a more distant origin than that which inspection demonstrates. They believed that the nerves of one side sprung from the opposite one, and that a kind of decussation in each pair took place not only in the brain, but also in the spinal marrow. This opinion is grounded on a singular phenomenon, namely, that paralysis ge-_ nerally takes place on the side opposite to that in which the brain has been compressed, a pheno- menon of which diseases frequently afford an in- stance, and rendered likewise striking by experi- ments, as Lorri has ascertained. On the contrary, it is said that convulsions take place on that side where the brain has received the injury. But this fact is infinitely more uncertain than that of para- lysis, which is indisputable. I do not believe that our actual knowledge can enable us to state any thing in support of this last case, and the anato- mical opinion above stated is evidently contra- dicted by the first glance. I shall make one single observation in respect to this singular phenomenon; which is, that it relates particularly to the nerves of motion: those of sensa- tion are hardly ever affected by it. In fact it is well known that in wounds of the head, after apoplexy, See. one of the eyes, one ear, one side

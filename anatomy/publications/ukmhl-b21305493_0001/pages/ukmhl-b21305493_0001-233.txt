It forms granulation from its sur- face; 3rdly. It suppurates; 4th!y. It contracts ; 5thlv. It is covered with a thin and delicate skin, red at first, but afterwards of a whitish hue, becoming white at different stages. First Stage. The instant that a wound is received, inflamma- tion takes place. It is the unavoidable offspring of the irritation that is excited by the instrument that produces it, contact of air, accidental particles of dress, or surrounding substances. Before the accident, the greater proportion of these parts involved in the breach of continuity being un- exposed, possessed only organic sensibility, but afterwards these same parts concurring to form the surface of the body, have animal sensibility su- peradd ed to it, or that principle which transmits received impressions to the brain ; the effect then of inflammation upon organs endued only with the first kind of sensibility, is to exalt it to such a degree, that it is placed on an equal footing with the second, and like it receives the faculty of transmitting perceived impressions to the brain. o 2

45 CELLULAR SYSTEM. Having* laid bare the cellular tissue by these means, I have frequently satisfied myself, that it does not contain so large a quantity of serum as is generally thought. 1 have found, that the cellular serum is much increased or diminished during digestion, or after sleep, when the skin is in a copious state of perspiration,â€”circumstances under which I have repeated these experiments. This fact perfectly coincides with that I have stated in my treatise on membranes, respecting the fluid which lubricates the serous surfaces, and is almost always found in the same pro- portion. It is well known that in cases of anasarca the quantity of cellular serum is very much in- creased, and is entirely suspended in inflamma- tion, &c. This fluid appears to be absolutely albuminous in its nature, as is proved by chemical experi- ments made in dropsical cases ; but may it not have been changed in its properties by disease ? To ascertain this fact, I inflated a dead animal so as to dilate the cells, for the purpose of affording an easy passage to an injection of alcohol, which I afterwards introduced by means of a syringe. Having stript it of its integuments, a few mo- ments after I observed here and there divers whitish flakes in the subjacent tissue. I have made the same observation on immersing into diluted nitric acid, a small portion of the cellular

627 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. to reach the capillary vessels, and consequently to flow through them; and the blood proceeding from the right ventricle must take much less time to reach the left auricle, than that supplied by the left ventricle will require to be returned to the right auricle; then, although in what is com- monly called the small circulation, the rapidity is not greater, the distances over-run being less, the time required is also less; then again, the sur- plus of fluid contained in the divisions of the aorta, in the general capillary system, and in the general veins, over the quantity contained in the pulmo- nary arteries, veins, and capillary system of the lungs, is counterbalanced by the length of time the latter requires to complete its course, which is short, when compared with that required for the former. From this we find, why, in these classes of the animal creation, in which the lungs in re- spect to circulation are opposed to the whole body, nature has constantly placed that organ next to the heart; if the one were placed in the head, and the other in the lower region of the pelvis, the harmony would be necessarily destroyed.

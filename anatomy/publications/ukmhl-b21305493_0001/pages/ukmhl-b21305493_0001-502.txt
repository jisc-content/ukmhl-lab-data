VASCULAR SYSTEM 360 should have neglected it. I have therefore repeated that experiment ten times at least on the carotid artery: it was constantly attended with the following result:—the tube included be- tween the two ligatures, and filled with blood, was actually impressed with real motion; but it was part of the general locomotion only of which it partakes with the whole artery, and which is produced by the impulse of the blood against the ligature corresponding to the heart. To be con- vinced of this, it is only requisite to lay bare that artery to some considerable extent, and we shall evidently perceive that the whole tube, either the part that is towards the heart, that included by the two ligatures, or the other, is agitated by the same general motion. 8th. Instead of blood, I have secured various kinds of irritating fluids in a portion of an artery: the same insensibility, the same deficiency of contraction in the coats, but the same general locomotion were the result. 9th. Several authors have produced con- traction in arteries, by stimulating them with concentrated acids • this is true;—and I have also produced the same effect; but this is not the result of contractility—it is mechanical shrink- ing. It must also be noticed, that after such contraction, the arterial texture can never be restored to its primitive state ; that the alkalies, which are in every respect as irritating as acids, whenever the vital powers are to be excited, pro-

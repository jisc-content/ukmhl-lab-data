general considerations. lxxix ' subordinate to the habitual composition and de- composition of our parts, because this life is com- mon to all organised beings, animals or vege- tables ; because the only condition required to enjoy it is organisation ; and lastly, because it constitutes the limits between organic or inor- ganic substances, in the same way as animal life â€¢ constitutes the limits between the two classes that form the first. Animal life is composed of the actions of the senses, which receive impressions from without of the brain that perceives them, thinks and wills; of the voluntary muscles and larynx which execute its will, and the nerves which are the agents for its transmission. The brain is truly the central organ of this life. Digestion, circu- lation, respiration, exhalation, absorption, secre- tion, nutrition, calorification, or production of animal heat, compose organic life, whose principal and central organ is the heart. I have placed animal heat in this order, because it is evidently, as I shall prove in my chapter on the capillary systems, a function analogous to secretion, exhalation, and nutrition. It is in effect an evolution of combined caloric from the mass of blood; it is, if you will, a secretion, or an ex- halation of this fluid, in every part. Until now I had not in my physiological classification as- signed it this place, but on re-examining the vol. i. G

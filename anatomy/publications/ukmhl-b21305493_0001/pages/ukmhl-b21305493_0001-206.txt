CELLULAR SYSTEM. 64< been describing on the envelope of each cell with- out any of those filaments which pervade other parts of the membrane. These plates have not, invariably, the same thickness; they are sufficiently dense when the cellular tissue is close and contracted, but become so slight and delicate when it is distended with air or any other means, that it is impossible to conceive any thing like organization in this thin etherial substance. It does, however, really ex- ist, in spite of opinions that have been entertained to the contrary. In fact, what is a tissue, I would ask, which is nourished like other parts, in- flames or suppurates, is the seat of distinct vital functions, and has an inherent property of life, if it be not an organic tissue ? All these indefinite notions of concrete juices, inorganic gluten, coa- gulated juice, that have been founded on the cel- lular tissue, rest on no individual observation or experiment, and must be discarded and banished from a science where imagination goes for nought, and facts are every thing. The cellular tissue displays marked varieties of organization : wherever fat or serum is deposited, we find the cells in form of minute pouches or bags, which communicate together, and form so many receptacles, the parieties of which are com- posed of the transparent and non-filamentous plates of which we have spoken;â€”it is in these bags that fat and serum are secreted.

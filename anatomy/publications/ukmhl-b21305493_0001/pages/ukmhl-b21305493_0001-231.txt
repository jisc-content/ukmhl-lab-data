89 CELLULAR SYSTEM* general idea of laudable as well as sanious or unhealthy pus. In the skin, mucous surface, or the bones, this secretion is vitiated to a certain degree, and differs in the various or- gans as much as the changes in the vital pro- perties from which it is produced. The changes too in the qualities of this secretion, are as widely different in different organs as the se- cretion itself. Does the cellular tissue assume the peculiar mo- difications of the vital properties which take place in the organs of which it is a subordinate part ? From what I have said above, this should seem very improbable. What I have just remarked, is particularly applicable to the cellular tissue found in the spaces between the organs, but not when it enters into combination with them. It is possible, however, that the activity of its vital principle may be diminished in cartilages, tendons, &c. and increased in the skin, and that the same principle may have a tendency in common to harmonize and consort with that of the organs where it is resident. But these are purely con- jectures, unsupported by any positive evidence. One fact, however, we must not pass over here in silence. I allude to the striking: differ- ence that exists in the vitality of the cellular tissue, which is composed of layers and filaments almost every where diffused, and that which is entirely filamentory, and lies external to mucous vol. i. o

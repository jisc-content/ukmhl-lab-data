OF ANIMAS- LIFE. 187 the peculiar mode of sensibility each organ is pos- sessed of. If vve now examine the parts the cerebral nerves perform in these two kinds of animal sensi- bility, it would appear that they are equally es- sential to each other: 1st; This, in respect to the organs of the senses, cannot be doubted. Sight, hearing, smell, or taste, have never continued to subsist after the optic, the auditory, the olfactory and gustatory nerves, have been materially injured. I do not allude to the touch, which does not re- quire, as the other senses, a peculiar modification of animal sensibility, nor more than the general fact, but merely a peculiar form in the organs calculated for it, in order to adapt themselves to the conformation of exterior bodies; 2dly, In re- spect to general sensations, every time that the cutaneous nerves in any part of the skin cease to be totally active, they become perfectly insensible ; it may be pinched, irritated, burnt, &c. without perceiving it. A complete state of paralysis in respect to feeling, exhibits in the human species this phenomenon, which may be artificially produced in animals, by dividing or tying every nerve that resorts to a limb. When the pituitary membrane, after having lost its peculiar faculty, is still sensible to the touch, the olfactory nerve only is paralyzed. If those nerves that enter through the spheno-palatine foramen, by the anterior and posterior nostrils, u 2

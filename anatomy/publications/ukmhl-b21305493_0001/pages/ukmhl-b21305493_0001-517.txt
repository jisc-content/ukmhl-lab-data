OF THE RED BLOOD. 375 textures, &c. It was to prevent arteries from disturbing by their movements the unity of the impulse, that nature has thus reduced them to a passive state. Let us suppose that they are en- dowed with the same degree of vital powers as the intestines, what would become of life ? The least convulsive contraction rather too strong in the aorta, or in the large trunks, by contracting their calibre too much, would obstruct circulation, and by acting in opposition to the heart, produce the most fatal consequences. In the intestinal tube this phenomenon would only produce vomiting. In the arterial system, it would cause instant death. The more this sub- ject is accurately considered, the more we shall be convinced how necessary it is that there should be, in respect to the arterial system, but one impelling agent, and that this system always inert should not impede the progress of the fluid. I do not intend to say, that arteries cannot, in peculiar cases, contract from the vital influence; the skin that is not irritable is very much wrinkled by cold. But such cases must be very scarce ; when they do exist, they cause an inequality of pulsation in both sides: an inequality that is scarcely ever observed in disease.

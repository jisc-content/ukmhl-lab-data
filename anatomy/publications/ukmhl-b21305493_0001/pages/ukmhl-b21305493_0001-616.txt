They are sooner boiled than the arteries, and seem to admit of being reduced by a long continuation of this pro- cess to a pulpous state, a state of which arteries under similar circumstances are not susceptible. Caustic alkali appears also to have rather a powerful action on veins. After having remained’ for a short time in this alkali, they become diapha- nous, as it were, less bulky; do not completely dissolve, it is true, nor diffuse, as when immersed in acids, but visibly lose part of their elements, leaving a remarkable sediment, and the strength of the liquor is always reduced by the new com- binations it has undergone. \ SECTION If, Parts common to the Organization of the System of the Dark Blood. Blood Vessels. The veins contain in their tissue, minute arte- ries and veins, which follow nearly the same directions as in the arteries,—they first ramify in the cellular membrane, give off small branches to the adjoining parts, then penetrate into the veinous fibres, winding in a variety of different

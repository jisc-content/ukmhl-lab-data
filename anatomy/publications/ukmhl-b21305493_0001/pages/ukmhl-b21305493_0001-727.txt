CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 585 we have seen these organs do not seem to be connected with organic sensibility. This is as- certained by the most careful observations ; the nervous power, at least such as we observe in other parts, has, in inflammation as in secretion, exhalation, and nutrition, scarcely any influence. In this affection there is a change in organic sen- sibility, and nothing more. The species of blood varies in inflammation ; and in this respect we might, I believe, lay down what follows as a general rule: whenever or- ganic sensibility is excessive, and attended with an increase of vitality in the part affected with inflammation, it is the red blood that stagnates in the capillary system, and the degree of heat is much increased. When inflammation, on the contrary, approaches the typhoid character, the part is dark and livid, the capillary vessels are filled with dark blood, and the temperature is much reduced. In general, a lively hue, florid, in every kind of eruption analogous to inflammatory tu- mours, denotes an increase of organic sensibility. Every livid aspect, on the contrary, bespeaks its deficiency : petechise and scorbutic spots are livid. In tumours, a livid hue always precedes gangrene. If we are desirous to know when cold acts as a stimulant ? It is when it reddens the nose, ears, &c. When these parts become livid, other phe- nomena at the same time denote its action to be sedative. This corroborates my experiments re- VOL. i. y Y

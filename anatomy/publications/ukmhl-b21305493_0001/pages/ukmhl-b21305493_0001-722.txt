In respect to inflammations, a scale of inten- sity may be formed. In taking the cutaneous inflammations for an example, we shall find, at the bottom of the scale these flushes, which come and go from the slightest external irritation of the dermoi'dal system, in which there is merely an afflux of blood, and which may in this respect be produced at will; then, those rather more intense, producing cutaneous efflorescences, and lasting a few hours only, but unattended with fever ; then again such as are attended with some fever, that are formed and disappear in the course of a day ; afterwards the erysipelas of the first order; then, such as are more intense, up to those which soon terminate in gangrene.

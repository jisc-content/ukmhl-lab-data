Remarks on the Course of the Bile. Notwithstanding this question is in some degree unconnected with my subject, yet, as the dark blood of the abdomen may really influence the secretion of bile, (as my experiments, besides, on this head accurately determine the course of this fluid,) I do not think it useless to relate them here. Whatever more is to be known respec- ting the uses, the mechanism, &c. of this secre- tion, is related in the books on physiology, to which I refer. It has been long disputed if there exist a cystic bile and hepatic bile ; if their nature be different; if their quantity varies, or increases, *fcc.: various and even opposite opinions, as Haller has judi- ciously observed, have all been supported by nume- rous experiments performed upon living animals; these experiments, although contradictory at

lxii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. the affection soon becomes more or less general, according to the ample evidence that dissection affords. 8thly. Acute and chronic affections of the bladder, and even the womb, have nothing in com- mon with the inflammation of that part of the peritonaeum corresponding to these organs. 9thly. It is well known that the diseases of the periosteum, are distinct from those of the bony structure, and inversely, that the medulla may be a long time affected without participation of the bone or membrane. It is certain that the bony, medu- leary and fibrous structures have their peculiar dis- eases which must not be confounded with those of the bones. The same remark applies with great force to the intestines, stomach, &c., in respect to their mucous, serous, and muscular tissues, &c. lOthly. Although the muscular and tendinous structures be united in the same muscle, yet their diseases are separate. 11th. In the same manner the synovial mem- brane is not subject to the same affections as the ligaments which surround it, &c. It is my opinion, that the more deeply we study diseases and their phenomena after death, the more forcible and impressive our conviction will be of the necessity of considering local diseases, not with respect to the viscera, the whole of whose structure they do not attack, but to the different tissues which are separately af- fected.

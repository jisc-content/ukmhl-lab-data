XXV GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. have no association with the phenomena they describe. If we look at the living bodies, we shall find them wasted and supplied, incessantly receiving and rejecting new substances, while inert bodies rest uniformly the same, and preserve the same elements till friction or other mechanical causes destroy them. In like manner, we shall see in the elements of inert fluids an unvarying regularity and determined identity in their prin- ciples, which are perfectly known when once analyzed; whilst these principles continually changing in the fluids of living bodies demand a thousand analyses, made under every possible circumstance. We shall perceive glands and exhaling surfaces shedding, according to the de- gree of their vital power, numberless varieties of the same fluid. What do I say? They shed varieties of fluids essentially different; for do we not discern two distinct fluids in the perspiration and urine that are furnished in one state of the body, and the perspiration and urine that are secreted in another ? A thousand examples might be produced to prove this assertion. The vital properties are by nature prone to ex- haustion, and are impaired by time in the same body. They are active and unworn in infancy ; fixed and stationary, as it were, in manhood; and decrease and decay in old age. It is said, that Pro- metheus having formed some statues in the image of man, stole lightning from Heaven to animate

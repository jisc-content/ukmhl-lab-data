VASCULAR SYSTEM 490 I have demonstrated in my researches on death, that the colour of those who have died from strangulation, submersion, &c. does not proceed from this cause, because it evidently could not extend as far as the general capillary system; but this receives the dark blood from the arteries, which in such cases convey this kind of fluid. The reflux of the dark blood in the veins, pro- duced in the preceding cases, either by an ob- struction in the lungs, or by the sudden disturb- ance in the action of the heart, take place also in the natural state, although in a much less de- gree. In fact, when the right auricle contracts, the whole of the blood does not enter the cor- responding ventricle; the mouths of the veins being free, a part reflows into them. It is difficult to determine the limits of this natural reflux, which all authors have noticed. When the chest has been laid open it is easily observed; its ex- tent might even then be ascertained; but in this instance respiration being no longer performed, as in the natural state, it is evident, that from this circumstance we are unable to judge of what takes place in the natural state. Insensible Contractility. This property, as well as organic sensibility, which, no more than the preceding, is ever sepa- rated from it, exists as well in the veins as in the

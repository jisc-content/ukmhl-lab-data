CELLULAK SYSTEM. 82 SECTION If. Vital Properties. The animal properties do not reside in cellular tissue in its natural state. You may divide it as you will with the scalpel, draw it out in every direction or distend it with gases. The animal, when submitted to these experiments, shews no signs of pain ; if any be felt, it is produced from the threads of nervous tissue that supply it, and may perchance have been accidentally injured. In a morbid state, on the contrary, the sensibi- lity of the part is increased to that degree, that it becomes the seat of the most acute pains. We have an obvious instance of this in phlegmonous inflammation. The organic properties are strongly marked in the cellular tissue. Fat and serum could not be removed by absorption, were it not for its organic sensibility which is excited by them into action. I should remark with respect to this property considered in the cellular system, that it is not affected in like manner or degree by all substances. Among the animal fluids, blood, lymph, and milk, whether extravasated or injected, do not augment it sufficiently to prevent absorption, whose system of vessels acts on them in common with fat and serum. This property on the other hand is so far changed by the action of urine, bile, saliva, and other excre-

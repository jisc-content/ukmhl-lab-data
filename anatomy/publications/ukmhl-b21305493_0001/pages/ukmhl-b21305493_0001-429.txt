It does not convey the materials for se- cretion, exhalation, and nutrition; but in this re- spect merely transmits what it has itself received from the lungs. SECTION II. Reflections on the General Uses of the Circulation. This leads us to some reflections on the gene- ral differences of the uses of both circulations, differences that fully establish the necessity of presenting the sole function that results from considering them in the point of view which I have suggested, and not in that generally used in physiological works. These differences are as follows: General Uses of the Circulation of Red Blood. It is the circulation of red blood that furnishes the materials of the secretions, excepting, how- ever, the bile, a fluid that claims further exami- nation. From this circulation the serous, cellular,

We shall always find; 1st. That the solids have lost their vital powers ; 2dly. That the fluids have yielded to putrefaction ; the former circumstance never suc- ceeds the latter. When organic sensibility begins to fail, the blood, induced by inflammation, may rea- dily putrefy, but putrefaction is always preceded by a deficiency of power in the solids. This local affection is the same as the general one in fevers of a typhoid type. It cannot be denied that in these fevers the blood has a tendency to decomposition and putrefaction. I shall go further. I will say, that this fluid frequently displays the first degree of dissolution. Now the indication of this change is constantly the general state of the powers (anfll Â°f~ the solids; they first loose their energy; symp- toms of debility appear before those of putre- faction. Every animal fluid has a tendency to putrefy; this is unavoidable whenever life has forsaken the solids through which they circulate. This tendency then may gradually increase as the solids are divested of their powers. The first de- grees of putrefaction of the fluids during life then, is not more unlikely as a general occurrence than as a local one. We have stated, namely, that the blood in an inflamed part begins to be putrid, and the part consequently to become fetid, before organic sensibility has completely left the solid.

700 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. This filamentous tissue, unconnected in some de- gree with the vessel, strengthens it, however, by forming an exterior membrane, superadded to that peculiar to its structure. If, as Cruikshank has done, the duct be turned backwards, and a glass tube rather superior to it in diameter be introduced, this membrane breaks. It is the very same thing as when a ligature applied to an artery, divides the internal membrane, and leaves the cellular one uninjured; a similar phenomenon is produced by inflation, a much more powerful exertion is then required to divide the cellular tissue than to lacerate the proper membrane of the thoracic duct. No fleshy fibres are ever observed, at least in a conspicuous manner, in the absorbents. A few authors have admitted them, but their assertion has been contradicted by inspection, even in the thoracic duct. It is probable, that the parieties of the absorbents are over-run with blood vessels; in common injections, they are frequently evident on the thoracic duct, but it is not known whether they are provided with nerves; if we judge by analogy with the veins, to the structure of which they bear a striking analogy, they must be very obscure, admitting that they exist. The internal membrane that forms the tissue peculiar to the absorbents, is continuous with that of the veins, and forms with this an uninterrupted continuation of minute tubes. Delicate and

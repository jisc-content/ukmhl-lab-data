In fact, on one hand nerves are formed at the same time as the brain ; they are rather the organs of com- munication with that viscus than its real exten- sions. On the other side, if we consider the functions of a part of the nervous system with that which relates to sensations, we shall see that it terminates in the brain, and that the origin is exterior. Is it not said that the nerves proceed to such and such a part, that the arteries run, wind, &c. ? These are nothing more than so many metaphorical expressions, of which the least reflection suffices to rectify the sense. The nerves of animal life have their origin in three principal portions of the cerebral mass; 1st, From the brain; 2dly, From the tuber an- nulare, and from its extensions; Sdly, From the spinal marrow. The cerebrum produces none. This circumstance, which should not be over- looked, in examining the functions of each part of the brain, and which may perhaps, one day or other, throw a light on the difference of these functions, is sufficient to make us appreciate the opinion of several physicians of the last century, who lixed the source of the involuntary motions

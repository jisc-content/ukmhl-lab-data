CELLULAR SYSTEM. 41 extends to the sides of the chest; 7thly. in- jections of any kind of fluid into the cellular tissue of the dead body will produce artificial dropsy. The permeable state of this tissue has been much exaggerated, or rather it has been re- presented under a very different aspect from that in which nature displays it. Thus it is, that several physicians supposing it might ad- mit indiscriminately the passage of all the fluids of the animal oeeonomy, have considered these fluids as currents flowing more or less regular- ly in different directions. Thus perspiration has been considered as an exudation of the albuminous fluid of the cellular tissue through the skin, which, in the opinion of some modern authors, is thrown off with the caloric, that is constantly dis- engaging itself from the surface. Thus, also, the permeability of this tissue has been assigned to account for the rapidity with which fluids are conveyed to the bladder, and perspiration is ex- cited by warm diluents, &c. Such theories as these, that inspection never faite to disprove, are totally repugnant to the known laws of the living ceconomy, laws that shew us these fluids constantly circulating in the vessels, by the agency of the vital powers, of the organic sensibility and contractility of these vessels, and never exuding from those which afford them a proper channel to enter into VOL. 1.

320 VASCULAR SYSTEM last rings of the aorta cannot be perfectly sepa- rated from the first of each iliac. In arteries there are no longitudinal fibres. What is the nature of the arterial fibre ? The generality of anatomists identify it with the mus- cular : but however slightly these are examined, it is easy to be convinced of their difference. It is not, undoubtedly, the absence of the reddish hue that establishes this difference, since even in the human subject, in some parts that are really of a muscular nature, as the intestines, this colour is wanting. But the muscular texture is soft, loose, and can be very much extended ; on the contrary, the arterial texture, hard and solid, will sooner part than yield. This may be ascer- tained by tying an artery strongly. The two in- ternal coats will be divided : the cellular coat alone resists the pressure of the ligature, although it is applied to it. On opening the artery, a sec- tion corresponding to the thread is found: this division is perfectly similar to that performed by a cutting instrument. This experiment, pointed out by Desault, I have frequently repeated, both on the corpse and on living animals: its result, which is very constant, accounts for the frequency of hemor- rhage attending the operation of aneurism. There is undoubtedly no texture so fragile, if I may be allowed the expression, as the arterial, conse- quently none less fit to bear the ligature ; why

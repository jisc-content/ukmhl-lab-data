These communications do not resemble those of the arteries, in which conti- guity always exists between the branches that communicate. Here there is nothing but contigu- ity, and this is the way in which each of these cords, forming a nervous trunk, is, as we shall see, com- posed of filaments. It is then these filaments, which frequently straying from the cord to which they belong, proceed to the neighbouring one, so that after a pretty long course, the cords which begin the nerve are not composed of the same filaments as those by which it is terminated : in proceeding on, the whole is intermixed. Thus, the cords of the branches of the brachial plexus are not dis- tributed in the same manner as those which ter- minate it; for there exists this difference between the plexus, which are very apparent, formed by the nerves themselves, and those which are less evident, formed during their course in their inte- rior : that in respect to the first, it is the separation of the cords that form the net-work; whereas, in the second, it is formed by the filaments. I once employed myself in tracing attentively, and to some extent, all the filaments of the sciatic nerve, and found that those which above com- posed the exterior cords, below were for the most part in those of the centre. This remark proves that there are not some R

OF THE RED BLOOD. 377 minute vessels, the received impression is un- doubtedly weakened, and thus insensible orga- nic contractility supplies the deficiency ; however, I am induced to believe that the motion which the blood has received from the heart is not entirely lost until it arrives at that point where the trans- formation takes place, so that it may be established as a general principle, 1st. That in the large trunks, in the branches, and even in the ramifi- cations, the heart is all in respect to the motion of the blood. !2dly. That in the ramifications, the motion is produced partly by this organ, and partly by their vital powers. 3dly, and finally, That this vital action of the vessels exists only in the general capillary system. Pulsation then only exists to its full extent in the large trunks and the branches; in the ramifications it visibly declines and ceases in- the capillary system. The arterial texture of the large trunks is un- doubtedly provided, as we have seen, with in- sensible contractility. But on one part, the im- pulse received from the heart is so very powerful, and the column of blood so considerable, that the influence of this kind of contractility is useless ; irritability only might have had some influence, but it does not exist in the arteries. On the con- trary, in the capillary vessels, on the one hand, the shock impressed by the heart having gra- dually subsided, on the other hand, the streams of blood being very fine, require for their motion VOL.

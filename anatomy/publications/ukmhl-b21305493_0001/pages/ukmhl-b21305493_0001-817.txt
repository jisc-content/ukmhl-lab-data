67 5 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. Let us return to these different absorptions. Here I shall not enter into minute particulars to prove their existence, because these proofs will be produced in every system from which the ab- sorbents arise; 1st. The external absorptions do not exactly correspond with the exhalations of the same nature : in fact, it is not sweat, nor the imperceptible perspiration exhaled by the skin, that are taken up by the cutaneous absorbents; these fluids are excrementitious. In the same man- ner the mucous absorbents suffer the pulmonary perspiration to evaporate, and the other fluids ex- haled over their surfaces to mix with the food, to be afterwards expelled. The substances which the atmosphere and surrounding bodies contain, are, as we shall see, those selected by these vessels from an excessive irregular absorption, except, however, that of chyle, which is not absorbed in an uninterrupted manner, but is sometimes rejected, at other times taken up with remark- able activity. 2dly. The internal absorptions, on the contrary, correspond in all the parts with the analogous ex- halations. Thus the absorbents take up serum, from the serous system, serum and fat from the cellular system, marrow from the medullary sys- tem, synovia from the synovial system ; fluids which ha.d all, as we have seen, been exhaled and retained for a time upon their respective surfaces, and such absorptions are performed in a constant

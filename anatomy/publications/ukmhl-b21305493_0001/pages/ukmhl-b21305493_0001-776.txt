CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 634 balance must exist. If the blood were transfused in consumptive cases, it would produce death, be- cause the powers of the solids would not corre- spond with the consequent increase of action. Circulation in the capillary vessels of the lungs, is like that in other tubes ; they are influenced by the tonic powers of the part, and not by the im- pulse of the heart. This impulse terminates with the ramifications of the pulmonary artery. In cases then of inflammation in the lungs, the blood is not mechanically obstructed in this or- gan ; bleeding is not intended to reduce the vis a tergo. Forty ounces of blood might be drawn from the patient without in general the lungs being lessened. They would be less excited on account of the diminished afflux of this fluid ; but that stagnated in the capillary system will still remain. As long as irritation subsists, that irrita- tion will be, as it were, a loadstone that attracts the blood, and completely diverts it from its in- tended course: previously, this course was from the artery to the veins; now, it will be exclusively to the irritated part. Bleeding, then, acts, 1st. By reducing the quantity of blood that reaches the lungs, and consequently, by unburthening the diseased organ. 2dly. By lessening irritation in the solid ; an irritation that attracts the blood, and fixes it in the part. The habitual excitement impressed by the air on the capillary system of the lungs, promotes its

11 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. SECTION I. General Remarks on Physiological and Physical Sciences. These distinctions are founded essentially on the difference that exists between the properties presiding over the phenomena which are the subject of each class of science. Such is, in fact, the immense influence of these properties, that they are the first cause of all these phenomena. Let us investigate those of astronomy, hydraulics, dynamics, optics, accoustics, &c. and ultimately we shall be led by a long deduction of causes to gravity and elasticity, as the period of our re- searches. In the same way the vital properties are uniformly the primum mobile to which we must ascend, whether the phenomena we study are those of respiration, digestion, secretion, cir- culation, inflammation, or fever, &c. Nature, in bestowing existence on each indi- vidual body, has endowed it wifh a certain num- ber of properties that characterise it in particu- lar, and in virtue of which it contributes as far as its faculties extend, to all the phenomena which are incessantly developing, connecting themselves together, and succeed each other in the universe. If wTe cast our eyes around us, or direct them towards the most distant objects; if we take the telescope and survey those bodies that are floating in space, or the microscope, and look into the world of atoms, whose extreme

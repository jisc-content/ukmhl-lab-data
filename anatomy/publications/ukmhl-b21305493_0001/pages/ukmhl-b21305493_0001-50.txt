X GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. veloped, with more or less plenitude. Vital pro- perties necessary to the exercise of these new func- tions are then super-added to those above. Animal sensibility, and animal contractility, scarcely perceptible in the lowest species, attain different degrees of perfection the nearer we approach quadrupeds : accordingly, sensations and locomo- tion are more perfect. Sensible organic contrac- tility is increased, likewise, and in proportion, di- gestion and circulation in the large vessels, &c\, over which it presides, are developed in an in- creasing ratio. If we were closely to follow the immense se- ries of living bodies, we should see vital pro- perties gradually increasing in number and energy, from the lowest plant to the highest of animals —man ; we should see the lowest plants under the influence of vital and physical properties, and all plants subject only to those which belong to in- sensible contractility and organic sensibility; the lowest animals would be observed to have sensi- ble organic contractility engrafted on these pro- perties, animal sensibility and animal contracti- lity always increasing as they ascend. The phrase by which Linnaeus designated minerals, vegetables, and animals, is well known. This would be more correct:—1st. Physical proper- ties in minerals ; — 2dly. Physical properties, in addition to vital organic properties, (sensible contractility excepted,) in vegetables;—3dly.

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS* 574 ized vessel then is essentially active, it will either admit or reject the approaching fluid according to its susceptibility. The varieties in capacity have no connection with this phenomenon ; that of a vessel might be four times larger than the particles of the fluid it rejects, if this be repug- nant to its sensibility. It was in this respect that Boerhaaveâ€™s theory proved so very deficient. At the time this author published his work, the vital powers had not been analysed. Physi- cal powers were unavoidably produced to explain vital phenomena: hence the reason why his theo- ries were as incoherent. In fact, theories bor- rowed from this source to explain the vital phe- nomena, would prove as deficient as the vital laws would be inapplicable to those of natural philo- sophy. What should we think of irritability and sensibility being set forth to explain the revolu- tions of planets, and the courses of torrents ? We should smile at the idea; so must we if, to explain the animal functions, we should resort to gravity, impulsion, variety in capacity, &c. It is worthy of remark, that the physical sci- ences had made no progress until the simple laws that govern their innumerable phenomena had been analvzed. The same remark applies to medicine and physiology, which had no real grounds for their explanations, until the vital powers had been analyzed, and produced in every instance as the principles of phenomena. Let us

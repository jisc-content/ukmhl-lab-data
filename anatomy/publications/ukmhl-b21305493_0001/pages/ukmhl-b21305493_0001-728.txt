CAPILLARY SYSTEMS* 586 specting life and death ; in which I have ascer- tained, that the dark blood interrupts every func- tion, weakens, and even interrupts motion in the parts whenever it is conveyed through the ar- teries. % Varieties of Inflammation according to the different Systems. \ From what has been said in respect to inflam- mation, it appears to be seated in the capillary sys- tem, and consists principally in the alteration of the organic sensibility of this system, producing a determination of blood to vessels that did not previously receive it, and consequently an in- crease of caloric, &c. Wherever then the capil- lary system predominates, and the organic sensi- bility is more striking, inflammation must be more frequent, which is really the case. This affec- tion is most common in the cellular, serous, mu- cous, and dermoidal systems, and in these very liquid injections display an intricate plexus of capillary vessels much superior to that of the other systems. On the other hand, as not only nutrition, but also exhalation, and frequently se- cretion, take place in these systems, they na- turally require more organic sensibility, a pro- perty from whence all these functions are de- rived.

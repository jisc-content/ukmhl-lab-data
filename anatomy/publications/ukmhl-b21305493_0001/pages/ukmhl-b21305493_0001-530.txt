VASCULAR SYSTEM 388 traded at the moment the pulse ceases to beat, it is not because they contract to expel the blood, but because the blood that has passed to the ca- pillary system does not sufficiently dilate them, it is contractility for want of extension. This shows how the flow of arterial blood proceeding from an opened artery, corresponds with the di- latation of these vessels and the lessening of the stream with their contraction. But according to the opinion commonly admitted, quite the reverse should be the case. The dilatation and contraction of arteries being very trifling, and even nearly wanting in their natural state, it appears that the essential cause of pulsation consists, as Weitbreck has judiciously ob- served, in the motion of the arteries, a locomotion general and spontaneous throughout the whole arterial system ; but not consecutive, as that au- thor has understood it. I shall not now relate the proofs of this motion, they are every where to be met with I shall only observe that it is so striking in living animals, that whenever circula- tion has been attentively observed through their means, it is impossible to deny that it exists. Besides divers causes may produce alterations in the pulse; these causes are, 1st. Those relating to the heart, nearly the sole impulsive agent; thus the sensible organic contractility of this organ, being increased,diminished, or affected, sympathe- tically by any cause whatever, may occasion it to

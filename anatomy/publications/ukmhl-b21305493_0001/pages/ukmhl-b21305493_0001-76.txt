XXXVI GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. portance to mark the distinction in these two cases. It is contained in the following remarks: 1st. I divide diseases connected with the ques- tion we are discussing into two differest classes : 1st, into those which disturb animal life in parti- lar; 2dly, into those which especially affect or- ganic life. I say, especially ; for such is the intimacy of relation between these two lives, or species of life, that it is hardly possible for one to be changed without impairing the other. Thus fe- vers that disturb organic life excite an irritable action in the brain, which affects animal life. Thus primary affections of the brain influence circulation and respiration through the medium of sympathy, &c. &c. But undoubtedly it cannot be denied that there are affections whose principal and primary character denote disordered states of animal life, as convulsions, spasms, palsies, mania, epilepsy, catalepsy, &c. Therefore it ap- pears that the principles of these diseases are almost exclusively seated in the solids, and that for the greater part the fluids are by no means affected. Let us observe likewise, that crises also occur in these diseases. Hypochondriasis, hysteria, me- lancholy, &c. though appearing to reside more particularly in the solids, in some degree, how- ever, appertain to the fluids, as we see in many instances.

222 NERVOUS SYSTEM that it is in a state of complete inaction. It may undoubtedly perceive certain motions which take place inwardly, and particularly the sensations of pain that are produced there: for if organic defects are observed in the foetus, if it frequently dies in the womb of the mother, why should it not suffer by her diseases ? Perhaps the brain perceives pain with so much more facility, as it is not diverted by the external senses. We have seen that the first are constantly conveyed through the means of the nerves, and that in the second this mode of transmission is doubtful. On the other hand, the phenomena, the sensation, the impression, &c., are not in both, so that the ex- amination of their connections and of their dis- tinctions is indispensable. This examination will have considerable influence in respect to the knowledge of the kind of animal life the foetus may enjoy. Whatever this may be, it cannot be doubted that it is infinitely more limited than after birth. The softness of the brain is excessive in the foetus; it may rather be considered as a kind of softish fluid, which the arteries, or rather the exhaling vessels that arise from them, deposit in their intervals. These arteries are then exces- sively numerous. Thus it is that the brain is strongly tinged with a reddish hue. If cut into slices, numerous streaks of the same colour are seen in its substance.

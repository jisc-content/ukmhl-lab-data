OF THE RED BLOOD. 429 SECTION V. Accidental Developement of the System of the Red Blood. I shall speak (when treating of the organic muscles) of the accidental enlargement of the left side of the heart. As to arteries, new ones are never formed; but in numerous instances those which exist admit of a very considerable increase, arising from two causes :â€”1st. From an obstruction in the course of the blood. 2nd. From the production of some tumour. 1st. The dilatation of arteries from obstructed circulation, is shown by the tying of arteries in aneurism, and in the spontaneous cure of aneurisms, a phenomenon of which a tolerable number of cases have within a few years been published. Sometimes the great collateral trunks are enlarged; on other occasions, their diameter un- dergoes no change, and it is through the ramifica- tions that communications are effected. When- ever the branches are dilated, the thickness of their parieties increases, in proportion to the diameter; at least, I have twice ascertained this fact, which is analogous to that presented by the left ventricle when affected with aneurism. 2nd. Every tumour does not produce a dilata- tion of the arteries: this dilatation is seen in can- cers, as in those of the breast, of the uterus, &c., in the osteo sarcomatous tumours, spina bifida, in the divers funguses, &c.

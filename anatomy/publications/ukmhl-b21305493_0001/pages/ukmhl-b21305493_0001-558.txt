VASCULAR SYSTEM 416 At the same time that the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale have ceased at the moment of birth to transmit the blood, this fluid no longer circulates through the umbilical artery and vein. Why has the blood ceased to flow through that artery, although its diameter at birth is still con- siderable ? The chief cause appears to me to consist in the nature of the red blood, which is no longer connected with the sensibility of that artery. A proof is, that, after the respiration ceases for a time, after having taken place, and the blood has again become dark, the umbilical arteries will begin to beat again, and if the ligature be loosened, a considerable hemorrhage will ensue. Baudelocque has repeatedly seen this occur. In general, whenever respiration is properly performed, the blood ceases to flow through the umbilical artery, and, in this respect, the ligature might be dispensed with. On the contrary, as long as this function remains imperfect, the he- morrhage of the artery is to be dreaded. I rea- dily grant, however, that other causes might exist for this interruption in the course of the red blood. The four following casesâ€”1st. The absence of the blood in the umbilical vein ceasing to take place. 2nd. The interruption of the course of that in the vena cava inferior, through the foramen ovale. 3rd. The cessation ol the

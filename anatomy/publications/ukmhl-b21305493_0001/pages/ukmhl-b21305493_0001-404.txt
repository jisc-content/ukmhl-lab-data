262 NERVOUS SYSTEM I must confess I am rather at a loss how to classify these organs; it is impossible to deny but that they have the utmost analogy of structure with the others. They are also distinguished by another circumstance ; this is, that the nerves, in project- ing from their textures, almost immediately form plexuses, which we have already pointed out un- der the appellations of cervical, brachial, lombar, and sacral, in the same manner as the soliar, car- diac, mesenteric, &c., are formed by the nerves of organic life at the moment they project from their .respective ganglions; however, these last nerves are the conductors of very different properties. If in a living animal the superior cervical gan- glion be irritated, or even the inferior one, which is attended with more difficulty, although it may be accomplished, the muscles which they provide with nerves will not be affected: the same phe- nomenon is observed when the nerves themselves are excited. On the contrary, all irritation of a filament proceeding from the vertebral ganglions, instantly produce convulsions in the correspond- ing muscles. Sensibility is also perfectly diffe- rent in both these species of nerves. Besides the manner in which the nerves pass in every direc- tion from the vertebral ganglions, and that in which the other ganglions furnish theirs, do not admit of any analogy. Until further experiments enlighten us in this respect, let us be satisfied in explaining what strict observation supports.

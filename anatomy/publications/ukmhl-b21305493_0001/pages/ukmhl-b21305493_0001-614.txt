4?'2 VASCULAR SYSTEM arteries, and it may be remarked, that the ab- sence of them in these last vessels, is a further proof their tissue is not provided with vital con- tractility. In fact, if these, as the heart, con- tracted to propel the blood, this fluid would, in consequence, have as much tendency to return towards that organ as to proceed to the distant parts, and valves would be requisite at different distances in the arterial tubes, to check the first of these motions; but it is only in the origin of the aorta that they are found. Why is this ? Because in arteries, the effect of the contractility of the tissue only is to be counteracted, which being performed without exertion, and by simple contraction, can return but a very small quantity of blood to the heart. One single obstacle, then, was required in the origin of the arterial system, to prevent a disturbance in circulation, which might be produced by the reflux, occasioned during the time of the systole from the contrac- tility of the arterial tissue, a reflux that only takes place in peculiar cases; for generally, the contraction of arteries is the consequence of their containing less blood, which has been expelled during the time of the diastole. For this reflux to take place, it would be requisite that the effect of the contractility should during the systole, ex- ceed the quantity of blood lost by the arteries during the opposite state.

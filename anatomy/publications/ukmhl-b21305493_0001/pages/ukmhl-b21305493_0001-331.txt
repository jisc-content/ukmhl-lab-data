189 OF ANIMAL LIFli. o'ans conveyed to the brain ? Here are different phenomena which cannot possibly be well ac- counted for. If we admit that the nerves are commissioned to transmit these impressions ex- actly as those experienced by the exterior organs : 1st. Some organs are very sensible to the slightest contact, which, however, are supplied with nerves hardly perceptible, as the medullary membrane in long bones ; 2dly, Several organs, in which the ce- rebral nerves evidently penetrate, as the liver and the lungs, may be irritated, without causing apparently any pain ; 3dly, The muscles of animal life, into whose structure so mail}7 nerves* enter, and which, in respect to animal contractility, take such an active part, hardly ever cause pain when their texture is divided, without including in the division the nervous filaments by which they are penetrated ; 4thly, Ligaments into which no nerves enter, produce (as my experiments have proved) the most violent pains when extended. It is the same with tendons and aponeuroses, &c. ; 5thly, Every organ in the structure of which the nervous system is evidently not concerned, will, however, when inflamed, convey to the brain the most painful sensations, &c. &c. I could bring forward numberless other facts which the antagonists of Haller have so care- fully collected ; but these already noticed are so convincing, that we cannot but acknowledge that

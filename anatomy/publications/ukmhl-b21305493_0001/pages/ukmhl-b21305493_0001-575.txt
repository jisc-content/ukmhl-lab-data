483 OF THE DA UK BLOOD. arteries do not penetrate ; such as the tendons, cartilages, hair, &c., which evidently proves, that blood Â«mnot formed witlrrmij the general capillary system. In this system the fluid leaves the principles, from which it received its reddish hue ; probably borrows others: in a word, it is therein modified, but never produced. The egress of the veins from this system is not so easily distinguished as the entrance of the minute arteries, because the valves prevent injec- tions penetrating so far into these vessels. In sub- jects killed by asphyxia, apoplexy, &c., the ramifications of the veins are more readily ascer- tained. In these subjects they are seen to divide soon into two kinds: some attend the last arte- ries, the others are distinct from them. In the greatest number of our organs, the trunks of the veins pass out at the same part where the arteries penetrate. This rule, however, ad- mits of some exceptions; in the brain, for instance, the arteries enter it below, the veins pass out from above. In the liver, the one penetrates into the inferior part, the other escapes from behind, &c. In general, this circumstance is immaterial to cir- culation, which is performed in the same manner, whatever may be the connections between the ar- teries and the veins. In those parts where the ar- teries enter and the veins pass out, more or less cellular texture sometimes serves to unite the small vessels that are in juxta-position, at other

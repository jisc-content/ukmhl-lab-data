The changes that ganglions may undergo from diseases are but very imperfectly ascertained. In diseases of the heart, of the liver, of the stomach, / of the intestines, I have frequently examined the ganglions that give off nerves to these viscera: they did not appear to me to have undergone any change. In the worst cases of cancer of the stomach, when the whole of the adjoining cel- lular membrane is obstructed, and the lymphatic glands are considerably enlarged, I have con- stantly found the semi-lunar ganglion uninjured, excepting, however, one case, in which its volume was increased, and its substance rather more dense. In another instance, I found in a subject, brought to the Hotel Dieu for periodical mad- ness, the same ganglion, the size of a filbert, and containing a small cartilaginous body in its cen- tre.

Two subjects, how- ever, that I have lately dissected, have exhibited no alterations in these organs, although, during

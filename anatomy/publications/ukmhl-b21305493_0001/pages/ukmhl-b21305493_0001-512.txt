370 VASCULAR SYSTEM below the tumour, frequently beats with additi- onal force. If we remove the arm from a corpse, and render it flexible, by steeping it for some time in a warm bath, then adapt a small tube to the brachial artery, and place the other extremity of the tube within the carotid of a living dog, one of the large species, the heart of this subject will instantly propel the blood into the amputated limb, and the artery will experience a kind of pul- sation, undoubtedly less than in its natural state, but sufficiently strong to be felt, even through the integuments. I have frequently repeated this singular and astonishing experiment, which I shall occasionally mention hereafter. It had been suggested to me by another, which I have explained in my treatise of the membranes, and which consisted in causing the red blood to circu- late in the veins, without locomotion it is true, but with a vibration evident to the touch, and a degree of rapidity nearly equal to that in the arteries. This last experiment would be suffi- cient to prove that the heart is almost the sole impulsive agent that causes the blood to circulate in arteries. In fact, every stream of blood pro- ceeding from the veins is uniform, because the capillary system propels the circulating fluid gently into these vessels; whilst, on the contrary, it is thrown into the arteries by jerks, produced by the contractions of the heart. But, if a vein

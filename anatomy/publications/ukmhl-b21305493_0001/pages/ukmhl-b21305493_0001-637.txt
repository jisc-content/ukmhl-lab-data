OF THE DARK BLOOD. 495 heart; but on the other hand, this, in regard to circulation, would be attended with inconveniences that would continually impede the motion. It appears it is not the insensible contraction of the capillary system alone, that forces the blood into the veins, but also that the roots of these vessels are possessed of a kind of absorbing faculty, by means of which they draw the fluid into this system. Now the insensible motion proceeding from this power of attraction, is evidently per- formed from the roots towards the trunks, as is the case with the lymphatic vessels : hence, since on one part the blood has a tendency to be pro- pelled into the veins, and on the other, it is in some measure attracted by these vessels, it is evi- dent that the original cause of the motion is the capillary system. This impulse, communicated to the blood, is little more than the resistance this fluid meets with in its motion : thus, the slightest cause, the least resistance, checks this circulation. From hence, as we have seen, the necessity of anasto- mosis, and from hence, also, the necessity of aux- iliary means to promote this motion ; such as, 1st. The muscular action, the influence of which cannot be called in question, on seeing the stream of blood, in bleeding, accelerated by the motions of the muscles in the fore arm, or by the palpitation of the heart, when the blood rushes towards this organ after violent exertion, and on observing that

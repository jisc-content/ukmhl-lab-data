646 EXHALANT SYSTEM. The first includes those which reject fluids that are not intended to be returned into the body. Such are, 1st. The cutaneous exhalants from which perspiration flows. 2dly. The mucous ex- halants that form a part of the pulmonary per- spiration, the greatest part being^^sugglied, as I shall state, by the dissolution of thejluids of tbebf- mm. respiration ; that pour out also the gastric, intestinal juices, &c. In the second class are contained the exhaling vessels that reject the fluids which remain for some time on particular surfaces, or in cells, and which, subsequently claimed by absorption, are, by means of the lymphatics, returned to the course of circulation. To this I refer, 1st. The serous exhalants, which leave on their respective surfaces the serum that lubricates the membranes, and facilitates the motions of such organs as they cover. 2dly. The cellular exhalants that deposit in the cells the serum and the fat. 3dly. The medullary exhalants, that convey in the interior of the bone the medullary juices. 4thly. The synovial vessels that spread synovia both over the articulations, and in the tendinous junctures. The third class comprehends the exhalants that convey to every organ the nutritive substance in- tended to repair losses, and which is subsequently taken up by absorption, to leave room for a new supply. The division just stated, I have adopted in my

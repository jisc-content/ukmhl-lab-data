607 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. the substances that repair the losses it has sus- tained ; these are—1st. Digestion ; 2nd. Respira- tion. The former pours the chyle into the blood, the latter mixes with this fluid different atmo- spheric principles. Sometimes the matter absorbed from the skin is also added to its different sub- stances. The intermixture of the blood with the new substances it receives constitutes hemafosis. Now, these new substances incessantly bring with them in this fluid a supply of caloric; for, as all bodies are impregnated with this fluid, there can scarcely exist an addition of substance without an addition of this principle. In hematosis, then, the caloric is combined with the blood, but is not disengaged; it forms a part of the fluid ; it is one of its elements. Thus loaded with combined caloric, the blood reaches the capillary system ; it is there distri- buted throughout, where it becomes changed. It is, in fact, in this system that it is converted into the nutritive substance—into those of the secre- tions, the exhalations, &c. Every function in which the nature of this fluid is changed, in which pecu- liar principles are separated from it to constitute particular substances especially intended for such or such purposes, must necessarily deprive it of part of its caloric. I cannot pretend to say precisely how this is performed—whether it proceeds from the internal changes which the blood undergoes

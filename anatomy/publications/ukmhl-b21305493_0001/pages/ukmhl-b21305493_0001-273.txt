OF ANIMAL LIFE. 131 motions of the left; and reciprocallyâ€”The fol- lowing is the manner in which the cerebral mem- branes are disposed at the origin of the nerves ; the dura mater forms a species of sheath in the fora- men or fissure through which they pass, then quits them entirely, being partly lost in the cellular tis- sue, and in part reflected upon the borders of the opening to be continued with the periosteum. The optic nerve only affords an exception to this general rule; it is accompanied throughout its course with a fibrous sheath which extends to the sclerotic coat, which through its means commu- nicates with the dura mater; 2dly, The arach- noid membrane surrounds each origin of nerves with a fold most generally in the shape of a funnel, whose widest orifice is towards the origin. In lifting up the brain with caution, or in removing delicately the dura mater from the spinal canal, this covering, which continues as far as the bony aperture through which the dura mater is admitted, is easy distinguished. It is then re- flected on the surface of this membrane, corre- sponding to the brain, forming a kind of cul-de- sac between it and the nerve. Sometimes, as in the optic nerve or external motories, it penetrates the fibrous canal of the dura mater in accompanying the nerve, which it only quits at the middle of that canal, and which in consequence of reflexion, is thus partly clothed by the arach- noid membrane, and partly corresponding to cel-

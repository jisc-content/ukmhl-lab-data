CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 568 found even the coarse injections to return through the veins ? The communication by means of the capillary system, between these vessels and the arteries, is now an anatomical axiom. It Jias been much talked of. It has been asked if there is an intermediate agent for the arteries and the veins. Dissection has proved that it exists in the capillary system. Hence we ought to represent to ourselves the capillary system as a kind of general reservoir, in which the arteries enter on one part, and from whence, on the other part, the exhalants for nutrition pass into every organ, into some of these certain peculiar exhalants, such as those in- tended to separate the perspiration, lymph, fat, <&c.; into others the vessels of secretion, &c. It is, in short, a common reservoir, if I may be allowed the expression, where the red blood is received, and from which the dark blood, the exhaled and secreted fluids, &c. pass out. This idea is not grounded on supposition. It is fully established by the injections I have just mentioned. It should not be termed a mechani- cal transudation, similar to that of bile through the gall bladder. If this were the case, not only very liquid injections would unavoidably flow from the execretories, the exhalants, and be returned through the veins; but would also, by penetrating the pores, fill the whole cellular tissue. Nothing, on the contrary, round the vessels through which

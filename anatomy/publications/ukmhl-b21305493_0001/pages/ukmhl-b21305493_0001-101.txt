I never saw this membrane exclusively disorganized in one of the abdominial viscera, and healthy in its immediate vicinity ; its affection extends itself to an inde- finite distance beyond, nor can I conceive why authors have suffered its inflammations to pass almost unnoticed. They have charged the subjacent viscera, with what truly belongs, in the greater number of instances, to the peritonaeum alone.

Most frequently that part of the peritonaeum corresponding to a certain organ, is more particularly inflamed; as is exemplified in the stomach : This happens also in cases of sup- pressed lochia and catamenia, where that portion C;1 it lining the pelvis is primarily affected; but

726 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. glands above only being- tumefied, and several other similar proofs, that have induced me to consider these serous infiltrations as passive ex- halations, analogous to those produced in the he- morrhage, no longer admit of this opinion. It is very important to form a proper distinc- tion between the swellings of the lymphatic glands, in consequence of disease in the adja- cent organs, from those which form the tumid belly of infants, and other scrofulous affections. 1st. In the latter instance, the tissue of the gland is always first affected; in the former, never but in an indirect manner. 2dly. This swelling is peculiar to infancy; the preceding one embraces every stage of life. 3dly. When a gland swells from sympathy with another organ, it generally retains its natural texture and colour. It is only in the latter periods that the tissue becomes harder, cartilaginous, and even suppurates, but there is not that change of the tissue, which takes place in the mesenteric and bronchial glands, swelled by scrofulous affections. The appear- ance and texture are quite different. The lat- ter presents in that case a white substance, not very abundant at first, so that by dividing the gland, this substance is readily distinguished from the tissue, which is found in its natural state. At a later period, this white matter invades the whole gland, and the texture has disappeared. In phthisis, however, and sometimes, although not

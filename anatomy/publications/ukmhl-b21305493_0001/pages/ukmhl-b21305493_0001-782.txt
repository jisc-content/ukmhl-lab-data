This two-fold distinctive character in both species of these fluids, appear to me decidedly conclusive. 3dly. The exhaled fluids are poured out by an innumerable quantity of minute vessels separate from each other; the secreted fluids, on the con- trary, are gathered in one or several principal tubes, that pour them over the. surfaces to which they resort. 4thly. The greatest part of the former, after being exhaled, are returned into the circulation ; the latter, on the contrary, seem essentially in- tended to be expelled inwardly. Sthly. Numerous parts receive the exhalations; they are deposited upon the serous, mucous, sy- novial, cutaneous surfaces, in the cellular tissue, and even in every organ that interferes with nu- trition. The mucous and cutaneous surfaces, par- ticularly the former, are the only organs over which the secretions are spread. From all these considerations it results, that

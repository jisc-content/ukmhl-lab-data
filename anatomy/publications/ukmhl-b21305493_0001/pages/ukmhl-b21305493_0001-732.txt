590 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. SECTION VII. Structure, Properties of the Capillary Vessels. What is the structure of the capillary vessels? Such is their tenuity, that in this respect we can certainly state nothing grounded on experiment and open to inspection. It is highly probable how- ever, it is even certain, that this structure is diffe- rently modified in each organ; that it is not the same in tendons, aponeurosis, muscles, &c.; that this tissue really partakes of the nature of the or- gan, of which it actually forms an integral part. The membrane that lines the excretory vessels, the arteries, the veins, the exhalants, &c., vessels that either resort to the capillary system, or arise from it, is actually similar to that of these capil- lary vessels, but undoubtedly it is not the same. It is the diversity of structure of the capillary vessels, that, according to the organs in which they exist, essentially influences the distinctions of the vital properties, organic sensibility, and in- sensible organic contractility in particular; hence the peculiar modifications in every disease over which these properties preside, and which are seated particularly in the capillary vessels, as in- flammations, tumours, hemorrhage, &c. 9The varieties of structure in the capillary system

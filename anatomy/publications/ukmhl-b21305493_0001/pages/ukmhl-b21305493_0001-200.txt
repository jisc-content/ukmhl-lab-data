58 CELLULAR SYSTEM. Exhalation of Fat. Divers hypotheses have been advanced as to the manner in which fat is separated from the blood. Malpighi averred the existence of certain glands and excretory ducts that no other anato- mist has perceived since his time, and no one be- lieves in the present day. Haller supposed that this substance was entirely formed in the arterial system, circulated with the blood, and floated on the surface of the blood, owing to its being specifically lighter. Thus circulating, it escapes, according to his opinion, through the pores of the arteries, and oozes out into the cellular tis- sue. Such an opinion implies two things: 1st. The existence of fat entirely formed in arterial blood, an existence that is proved by no posi- tive fact, and of which I have never been able to convince myself by the minute inspection of red blood taken out of the vessels, and which never- theless, if this were the case, would infallibly ex- hibit numerous small particles floating on the sur- face of the liquid at the moment it is drawn. In my experiments on the colouring principle of blood, I have repeatedly ascertained this fact. I have also observed it in the blood of maniacs upon whom arteriotomy was performed in the Hotel Dieu; 2dly. Hallerâ€™s opinion is founded upon transudation wholly mechanical, that is quickly

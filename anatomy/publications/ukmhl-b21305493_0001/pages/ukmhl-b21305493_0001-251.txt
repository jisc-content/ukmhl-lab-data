CELLULAR SYSTEM. 109 fluid that exhales from it, exhibiting a smooth and polished surface contiguous to this fluid, another rough, flaky, and continuous with the adjacent cellular tissue, 2dly. Analogy in structure, cysts being always formed of a single sheet, as the mucous mem- branes have all, like these, a cellular texture, which is proved by inflation and maceration. Thus, they arise constantly in the midst of the cellular organ, particularly where it is most abun- dant. They are scantily provided with blood vessels, and are strongly characteristic of the exhalent system. 3dly. Analogy in the vital properties. Animal sensibility, though not present in the natural state, is very active in inflammation, organic sensibility always very obvious, firmness characterised by a slow and gradual contraction subsequent to the evacuation, either natural or artificial of the con- tained fluids, &c. Such are the characters of cysts: they also appertain, as we have had oc- casion to mark it, to the serous membranes. 4thly. Analogy in functions. Cysts obviously are the secreting or rather the exhaling organ of the fluid they contain. Exhalation is particularly striking, when, subsequently to the evacuation of such fluids, the removal of the membranous bag, or the producing artificial inflammation, has been neglected. Absorption manifests itself in the spon-

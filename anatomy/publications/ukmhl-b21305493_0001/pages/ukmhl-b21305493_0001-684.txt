VASCULAlt SYSTEM 542 proofs that it was intended for other purposes than the secretion of this fluid. No kind of doubt can remain in this respect; it is a further proof that in the adult the disproportion of the organ with the fluid, although not so considerable, also implies that this viscus is intended for some other important function, with which we are unac- quainted . At birth there must exist a precise connection between the obliteration of the veinous canal, the foramen ovale, and that of the arterial canal, be- tween the increased action of the lungs and the reduced action of the liver, &c. We judge of this connection without being acquainted with it, because, as I have previously stated, the circula- tion of the foetus is still involved in obscurity. I only observe, that the predominance of the liver anterior to birth, does not imply a similar state in the system of the dark abdominal blood; it depends exclusively from the umbilical vein: thus the proportionate volume of this organ gradually decreases, particularly in the left side, where this vein was extended, as Portal has observed. It is a very delicate matter indeed, to fix the period when the equilibrium is generally established. In youth, the system of dark abdominal blood, as well as the general one, is rather deficient in activity. It is towards the thirtieth or fortieth year that it seems most active; this is the period for gastric diseases, for piles, for melancholy,â€”a

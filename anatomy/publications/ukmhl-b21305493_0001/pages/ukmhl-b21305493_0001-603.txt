In the heart it is fleshy; in the pulmonary artery it is analogous to the tissue in the division of the aorta ; in veins it has a pecu- liar character ; this last, especially, will be imme- diately considered. Proper Membrane of the Veins. To view this membrane, 1st. The loose cellu- lar tissue that unites the veins to the adjoining parts; 2dly. The cellular layer of a peculiar na- ture, which directly covers them, and has been mentioned in the Chapter on the cellular sys- tem, should first be removed ; then, longitudinal fibres, parallel, and forming a very thin layer, not always perceptible at first, but in every instance existing, are discovered in the large trunks. When veins are considerably dilated, these fibres being more separated, are less striking than in the state of contraction. In the trunk of the inferior vena cava, these longitudinal fibres are more evident than in that of the superior ; in general, it may be granted, that they are also more strik- ing in every division of the former than in those of the latter vessel: Of this I have been convinced by numerous dissections. It undoubtedly proceeds from the greater facility with which the blood cir- culates in the second, than in the first of these

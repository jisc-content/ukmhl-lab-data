CELLULAR SYSTEM. 98 who arrives at this stage by the two final ones of inflammation and cicatrisation. Third Stage. There is no stage of suppuration in the cicatri- sing of bones, in that of divided cartilages, la- cerated muscles, and rarely in the union of most organs divided without an external wound. It is necessary then, in the first place, to shew what relation subsists between these cicatrices and those of external organs ; for one individual principle is found to preside over all the operations of na- ture, differ, as they may, in their outward form and aspect. In a fractured bone, the two first stages of its union are precisely the same as those of external organs, the ends inflame and are covered with fleshy granulations ; in the third stage these granu- lations previously united assume the nature of a secreting or rather an exhaling organ, which at first separates the gluten that surrounds it, and gives the appearance and character of cartilage to the callus, afterwards effuses phosphate of lime, and subsequently completes its transformation into bone. In the cicatrization of cartilages, glu- ten, in divided muscles, febrine is exhaled; in a word, the cellular tissue is the common basis of the healing process in all internal organs: as granula- tion is every where the same, the process by

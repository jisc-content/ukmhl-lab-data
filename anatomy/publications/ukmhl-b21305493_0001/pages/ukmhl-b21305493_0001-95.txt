general considerations. lv if veins are analogous in their nature, &c. Let us compare the result of my experiments upon the tissues, and the question will be straightly re- solved. It should seem at the first glance, that all these researches into the intimate structure of the organs, conduct us to no great results; but I believe they have accomplished a very essential end, that of determining with precision the limits of every organized part; for as the very nature of these textures is unknown, it is re- quisite to mark them specifically, according to the different results they produce. 3rdly. Nature has not only granted a different organic arrangement to every part, but endowed it also with different properties. We shall observe in the sequel of this work, that those we ascribe to what we call tissue, display infinite degrees of variety from the muscles, skin, cellular membrane, &c. which enjoy them in the highest degree, to the cartilages, bones, tendons, &c. which are almost destitute of them. Need I speak of vital pro- perties? We find animal sensibility prepon- derating in the nerves; animal contractility in the voluntary muscles ; sensible organic con- tractility constituting the especial property of the involuntary muscles; insensible contractility and sensibility of the same species, which, is not more easily separable from it than the pre- ceding, strongly developed in the glands, the skin,

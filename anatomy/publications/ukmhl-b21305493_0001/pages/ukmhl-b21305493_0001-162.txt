CELLULAR SYSTEM. 20 by sympathy on distant organs, whilst it has no effect on the surrounding ones with which it has no relation : for instance, a bath will check spasmodic vomiting, without tranquillizing in. any degree those pains that have their immediate seats in the sub-cutaneous organs in general. The vital powers of an organized part generallv undergo a specific change, and its disorders conse- quent are produced in three distinct ways; 1st, by direct irritation, as when the tunica conjunctive is inflamed by exposure to cold air, or air loaded with moisture and exhalations; 2ndly, by sympa- thy, as when one eye being diseased the other lias its structure involved in the same affection without any apparent essential cause ; 3rdly, by cellular communications,as in carious bones, where the integuments appear of a dull livid hue, and swoln. Why is the cellular membrane, in some in- stances, an agent that nature employs to defend the organs from the influence of that which is diseased, whilst in others, it serves to propagate disease ? Let us confine ourselves, on this point, to the evidence of facts; the enquiry of causes is merely matter of conjecture. The cellular atmosphere of the organ is not only connected with the immediate phenomena of its vitality, but also with the different motions this organ performs: consequently, it is more abun- dant as these motions are more extensive.

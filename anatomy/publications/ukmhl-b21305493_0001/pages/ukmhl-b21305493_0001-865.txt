723 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. The absorbant system is very liable to be sym- pathetically influenced by the other organs. This disposition relates; 1st. To the glands; 2dly. To the vessels. One of the phenomena the most frequently disclosed by dissection, is the swellings of the lymphatic glands in organic affections of the im- portant viscera. This phenomenon is observed, 1st. In the neck, in respect to the jugular glands, from the affections of the thyroid gland, and sometimes, from those of the larynx. 2dly. In the chest, in the axillary glands, and frequently in those of the mammae; from cancer in the breast, and in those which surround the bronchiae ; from every species of phthisis, but seldom or ever from diseases of the heart, whether aneurism, ossi- fication, or affections of the valves. 3dly. In the abdomen, in cancerous diseases of the stomach, particularly of the pylorus, and in the greatest part of those in which the tissue of the liver is altered, the mass of glands that attend the biliary vessels, and those which surround the pan- creas are tumefied; so are the mesenteric glands, in cases of schirrous of the intestines, and of the urethra, which is generally rare. In diseases of the womb, of the rectum, of the bladder, the glands of the pelvis become tumid, and in schir-

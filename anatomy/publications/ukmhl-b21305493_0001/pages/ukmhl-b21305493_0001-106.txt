IxVI GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. penis, &c. We observe phthisis merely producing in the beginning, a few small tubercles in the pulmonary structure, and afterwards often at- tacking the pleura, and bronchial membrane, &c. If we examine the bodies of those that have died of chronic diseases, in their different stages, we shall easily ascertain the following fact, namely, that the disease of one tissue in an organ will extend by degrees to the others, and we should judge very inaccurately of its primary seat, if we were to estimate it from those parts where it is seen in the moment of dissection. In acute diseases, the continuity of structure is of itself sufficient to create different symptoms in parts that are not affected. When the peritoneum only is inflamed vomiting ensues. Cough, and even copious expectoration are sometimes symp- toms, when the pleura only is diseased. Inflam- mation of the tunica arachnoides is attended by delirium, although this membrane has no concern with the intellectual functions. Diseases of the pericardium frequently derange the action of the heart, &c. We cannot therefore deny, that the affection of one single tissue in an organ will frequently suffice to disturb the functions of all the others; but it is not less on that account the original and sole source of the disease. I shall now proceed to further considerations, on the influence which the anatomy of organic structure has over diseases.â€”

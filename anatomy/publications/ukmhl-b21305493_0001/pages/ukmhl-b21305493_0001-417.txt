275 OF ORGANIC LIFE. tility, since, as we shall afterwards perceive, they may be cut, divided, or irritated, without annihi- lating or increasing the motion of the muscles to which they resort: but, although aware of the functions they do not fulfil, we are still igno- rant of those for which they are really intended. I have already mentioned, that the difficulty of making experiments upon the ganglions and plexuses will very much impede the progress of science: we have scarcely any branches exter- nally upon which we can act. Scarpa, in respect to the uses of ganglions, hav- ing united the opinions of his predecessors with his own, I shall refer to him on this subject; as the general point of view under which he repre- sents these organs, and that under which I have presented them, differ essentially. The exposure I have just made of the nerves of organic life ne- cessarily bear a general character quite distinct from that of his work ; a work, however, which (like every thing that author has published,) does the greatest honor to the anatomical epoch in which we live. I shall conclude this chapter by an impor- tant reflection. If nerves only divided in the ganglions, if these disclosed within nothing more than a division of their filaments, ex- cessively multiplied,â€”why should they be so constantly met with in animals ? Nu- merous organs are wanting, they differ, and

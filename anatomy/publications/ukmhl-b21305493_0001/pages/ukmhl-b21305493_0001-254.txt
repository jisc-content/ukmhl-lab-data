112 CELLULAR SYSTEM. accounted for, that, if the cells compressed and cemented together, form the unnatural bags, the adjacent cellular tissue does not diminish, and even totally disappear, when they attain a consi- derable size ? 4thly, If on the one hand cysts are formed by a compression of the cellular tissue, if on the other hand it is true (which cannot be doubted) that they exhale their own fluid, it must be admitted that the fluid pre-exists in the organ by which it is separated from the blood. I would almost as soon assert that the saliva pre-exists in the parotid gland, &c. I am induced to think, that the immediate con- sequence of the preceding reflections infers, that the manner in which the formation of cysts is generally accounted for, is diametrically oppo- site to the general process which nature follows in her operations. How then do these sacs arise and increase ? In the same manner as all tumours that we see arising externally, or manifesting themselves within, for there hardly exists any other distinction between these two species of un- natural productions, but the form each assumes. The major part of tumours expel through their external surface the fluid separated by them. In the cyst, on the contrary, that fluid is^exhaled through its internal surface, and is deposited in its cavity. Only suppose a fungous tumour in a state of suppuration suddenly converted into a

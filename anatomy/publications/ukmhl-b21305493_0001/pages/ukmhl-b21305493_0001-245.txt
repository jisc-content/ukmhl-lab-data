CELLULAR SYSTEM. 103 this difference is, that in the latter there is neither the second stage, the growth of granulations; nor the third, which is that of suppuration; nor the fourth, which is that of contraction. Union immediately follows the first stage, namely, of in- flammation. From what has been above stated, it is mani- fest that the cellular tissue is the essential agent in the production of the cicatrix ; that it consti- tutes both its basis and its inherent principles; that without it it could not take place; and that it is essentially dependant upon the property of growth and expansion with which that tissue is endowed. Influence of the Cellular Tissue in formation of Tumours. In the formation of the cicatrix, the cellular tissue seldom rises above the level of the divided part more than a few lines; the cells that it forms in its re-production are, generally speaking, very inconsiderable in their magnitude. This however is not the case when it happens to de- viate from the ordinary laws of cicatrisation, and some accidental cause perverts and vitiates its vital properties; it is then observed to shoot forth very extensive granulations, and which often con- tain greater abundance of this tissue than the parts from which they spring. All the various

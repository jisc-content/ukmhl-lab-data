290 VASCULAR SYSTEM previously rejected, in the same way as glands, from a change of their organic sensibility, fre- quently secrete fluids that are not common to them. 2dly. It cannot be doubted, that besides the principles that give colour to the blood, the poison of miasma is received into the lungs and produces diseases, as my experiments on asphyxia have elsewhere proved. The intestines, the lungs, and the skin, are then a triple door open on many occasions to various morbific causes: now these causes, which thus enter the economy, are all in the first place received into the dark blood ; it is only subsequently that they are received into the red, A stinking proof of this assertion is, that phe- nomena, perfectly analogous to those resulting from the causes already noticed, may be produced by injecting artificially into the dark blood such substances as are introduced by the natural pas- sages. Thus, a purgative or emetic infusion thrown into the veins, &c. produces evacuations and vomiting, in the same manner as when the solid parts of these fluids are introduced through the medium of the skin by friction. The experi- ments of numerous physiologists leave no doubt on this subject. I am convinced that it is possible to produce artificial diseases in animals, by intro- ducing into their circulation different substances from injecting the veins. I shall treat of these experiments in the article of the glandular system;

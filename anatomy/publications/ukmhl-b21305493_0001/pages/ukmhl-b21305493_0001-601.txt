Even admitting that the liver could com- press the vena cava where that vein crosses its posterior surface, it is evident that the anastomosis I have just mentioned would, at least in a great measure, prevent its operation. Supposing that an obstacle were met with in the vena cava superior, the same anastomosis would undoubtedly answer a similar purpose ; but as the vena azygos is inserted at a very short dis- tance from the auricle, the course of the trunk of the vena cava superior is consequently very li- mited ; it is evident that it is especially to obviate such obstructions as may take place in the inferior vena cava, that this anastomosis has been estab- lished. When the blood of this vein thus passes into the superior one, it flows through particular branches, contrary to its natural course.

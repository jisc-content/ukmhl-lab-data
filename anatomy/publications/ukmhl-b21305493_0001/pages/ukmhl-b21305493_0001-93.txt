general considerations. as well as on the practice of physic. In truth, under whatever point of view we may examine these tissues, they have no similitude with each other. It is nature and not science that has fixed the boundaries between them. 1st. Forms are every where varied: some are flat, some round ; the simple tissues spread them- selves only into membranes, are contracted into tubes, or gathered into bundles of fibres; none ex- hibit externally the same conformation in respect of their properties, thickness or bulk. The differ- ence of forms however may be only adventitious, and the same tissue presents itself in several different states. The nervous tissue assumes the form of a membrane in the retina, and that of cords in the nerves. The fibrous tissue is ar- ranged into fasciculi in ligaments, and converted into membrane in the fasciae. This does not affect their nature, it is organization and its pro- perties then, whose distinction we must make our peculiar study. 2dly. Organization is never analogous in simple tissues. We shall find it resulting, in fact, both from parts common and parts proper : now, the parts common to organization, are in the first place, very differently arranged in each tissue. Some of them are formed of cellular substance, blood- vessels, and nerves, &c., in abundance ; in others one or two of these common systems are hardly lo be discerned, and are even entirely wanting.

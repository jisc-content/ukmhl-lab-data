153 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Tiie theca of the nerves, produced in the man- ner we have mentioned, accompany these through the cavities of the cranium and of the spine. In these cavities it is very distinct, because it is not involved in cellular membrane, but merely in the arachnoid, which can be removed with the utmost facility; so that instead of making use of the divers preparations Reil has described, to separate the theca from the cellular texture of the nerves, it is much more convenient to examine this membrane in the last of the spinal nerves, which are there, as we have already noticed, of a considerable length. Effects of certain Substances on the Theca, or Nevrileme: its Besistance, fyc. The theca external to the bony cavities, im- mersed in the cellular membrane, adheres to it in a very striking manner, but appears evidently to be of the same nature as that within. We are ignorant of its nature, whether or not it is iden- tical with that of the pia-mater, of the medulla of the tuber annulare, and its appendages It appears to be strongly allied to the cellular membrane: it is transparent, and consequently of a different colour to that of the nerves. On this account, when these have been deprived of their pulp through the means of alkalies, they lose, in a great measure, their whiteness. vol. i. Â«

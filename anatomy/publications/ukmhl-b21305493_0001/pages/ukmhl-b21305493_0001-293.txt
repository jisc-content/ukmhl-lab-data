Because it is enveloped by a kind of general nevrileme; 2dly. Because its medullary substance is more abundant, and more readily obtained, its canals being larger ; 3dly. Because these being compressed together give it within the appearance of an uniform body; but by a longitudinal incision, it is easy to per- ceive that the medullary substance is separated by partitions. The auditory nerve is also distin- guished by a peculiar texture. From what we have said, it is evident that of the membranes of the brain, the pia-mater bears the most analogy with the nevrileme. It might almost be said, that in the vertebral canal they are one and the same ; in fact, it may be noticed, that this membrane, which has not hitherto been properly described, presents, according to the manner it is examined, three essential modifica- tions ; 1st, In the cortical substance, which in- closes the whole brain and the cerebellum, where it is of a reddish hue, excessively vascular, slack, capable of little resistance, and removed with facility; 2dly, In the white substance, which covers both anteriorly and posteriorly the tuber annulare, and the four main projections it re- ceives from the brain and cerebellum, where it is of a lighter red, when it begins to acquire a little

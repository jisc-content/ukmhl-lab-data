Influence of the vital Powers upon this Function. The functions of the absorbents are no longer doubted by any anatomist; but the manner in which these functions are performed is far from being as correctly ascertained. The very first idea has been to compare the action of the absorb- ents with that of the capillary vessels, but, how- ever little we consider this action, it will be easily perceived that these phenomena are perfectly dis- tinct from those of the inert capillary vessels. I believe it will never be precisely ascertained how the orifices of the absorbents, immerged in any liquid, take and deposit their particles and con- vey them to ascend their tubes; But what is indis- putable in absorption is, that the vessels are indebted for this faculty to the vital powers allot- ted to them; that it is merely the connection be- tween their peculiar mode of organic sensibility, and the fluids with which they come in contact,

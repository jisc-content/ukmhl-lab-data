410 VASCULAR SYSTEM The act of respiration, however, is essentially important to life, since it forms a new mode of connection between the organs, depending ex- clusively upon this cause. I presume that some unknown principle, a kind of instinct in short, induces the infant at the moment of birth, to con- tract the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. This instinct, which I cannot account for, and of which I cannot even convey the slightest idea, is the very same that induces the infant, on leav- ing the parentâ€™s womb, to move its lips, soliciting the breast, as it were, for its new and natural supply. It certainly cannot be said, that this motion is caused by the external and powerful impressions to which it is subjected. Such im- pressions will produce agitation, and irregular motions, as if struggling to liberate itself, and not an uniform motion evidently directed towards a particular end. If the different classes of animals were to be examined at the instant of birth, we should see each of them perform par- ticular movements, dictated by their peculiar instinct. Young quadrupeds seek the teat of the mother, chickens grain for food ; the carnivorous bird instantly opens its beak, as if to partake of the prey that is conveyed to them by the mother, &c. In general, it is very essential to distinguish properly those motions which, at the moment of birth, are derived from the new excitements ex-

II CELLULAR SYSTEM. Jongs to the cellular system, and bears the utmost analogy to the texture subjacent to the mucous membranes. It is never the seat of serous effu- sions, nor does fat ever accumulate there ; it is rarely attacked by inflammation; it arises almost imperceptibly from the neighbouring cellular tis- sue, which becomes condensed and is so inter- laced, that it may be wholly detached, and forms a sheath or canal corresponding to that of the artery it surrounds and supports. Are there any arterial fibres interwoven with this tissue as muscular fibres of the stomach and intestines are interwoven with the sub-mucous membrane ? I do not believe it; for if this were the case, we should not be able to detach this cellular sheath surrounding the arteries so easily. Arterial fibres appear to form complete circles, and consequently have not their extremities inserted like the muscu- lar fibres. Some of these fibres, nevertheless, re- main still adherent to the deepest layer of cellu- lar membrane when this is removed, as appears by their peculiar direction and yellowish hue. Cellular Tissue external to Veins. Veins are provided with an external covering analogous to that of arteries, but in general much less dense and firm. It does not separate so easily in an entire sheath as it does in the arteries. It contains no adipose substance, secretes little i 2

Nutrition exists, in parts which are evidently not provided with nerves, in cartilages, tendons, &c.; it is continued in paralysed limbs; in every instance, these changes are independent of the nervous system. Individuals that have this system the most predominant, and that are the most sensitive, are not those in whom nutrition is most active. Nutrition has never, I believe, in any way, been influenced by acting on the brain, the nerves, or on the spinal marrow. Marasmus is, undoubtedly, the consequence of all nervous diseases, but it is a phenomenon attending a number of other diseases. In palsies, the long rest, as well as the defect of nervous action, dis- poses to atrophy, for this continues a long time without being apparent. Who is not aware that after a lapse of two, three, and even four years, the affected limb is exactly equal to the sound one ?

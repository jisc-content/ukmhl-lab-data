CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 577 SECTION VI* ‘Consequences derived from the preceding Causes, in regard to Inflammation. From what has hitherto been stated, we may easily conceive what takes place in the phenome- na of inflammation, when considered in a general point of view. If a part be in any way irritated, its organic sensibility is instantly altered and increased ; the capillary system, hitherto unconnected with the blood, receives and attracts it, as it were: this fluid flows to the part and there accumulates', until its organic sensibility has been restored to the natural type. The capillary system, being impregnated with blood, is then a secondary effect of inflammation. The principal phenomenon that produces the others is the local irritation that has caused a change of organic sensibility. Now, this local irritation may be produced in various ways: 1st. By the direct application of an irritating substance,—as a straw to the tunica conjunctiva; cantharides to the skin, by offensive emanations, spread over the mucous surfaces of the bronchiae, or in the fossae nasales; by atmospheric air when

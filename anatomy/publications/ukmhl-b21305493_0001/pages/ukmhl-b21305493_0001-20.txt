XIV ANALYSIS. ARTICLE I. Exterior Forms of the Nervous System in Animal Life. v Sect. I.—Origin of the Cerebral Nerves.*— In what manner this origin should be understood.—It exists 1st. In the brain.—2dly. In the tuber annulare and its appendages.—3dly. In the spinal marrow.— Mode of this three-fold origin.—Of the interweaving of nerves.— Phenomena of paralysis in this respect.—Particular disposition of the cerebral membranes at the origin of nerves.—Extent, direction, and form of the nerves on their egress - - 125—133 Sect. II.—‘Course of the Cerebral Nerves; Communications of the Cerebral Nerves at their exit from their bony Cavity.—There are none, correctly speaking, between the cerebral nerves.—The com- munications begin with those of the protuberance.—They are re- markably multiplied in those of the spinal marrow.—Disposition of the plexuses arising from them.—Consequences in what relates to neurology ----- 134—136 Interior Communications of the Nervous Cords.—Mode of these com- munications.—Internal plexuses of each nerve.—Consequences.— They are different from anastomoses - - 136—139 Trunks of the Nerves.—Their course, form, length, &c. 139—140 Nervous Branches, Filaments, frc. Sfc.—Their mode of origin.— Length.—Course, &c. - 140—141 Sect. III.— Termination of the Nerves—What should be understood by this.—Treble mode of termination - - 141—142 Anastomosis with the same System.—What should be understood by anastomosis.—They are scarce in this system—They may be divided into three classes - 142—144 Anastomosis with the System of Organic Life - 144—145 Termination in the Organs—Mode of such termination.—Division of the organs in this respect ... 145—146 ARTICLE II. Organization of the Nervous System of Animal Life. Sect. I.— The Peculiar Tissue of that Organization.—How the nervous cords are disposed.—Their varieties.—Each nerve lias its peculiar organization.—Of the structure of nervous filaments 146— 14S

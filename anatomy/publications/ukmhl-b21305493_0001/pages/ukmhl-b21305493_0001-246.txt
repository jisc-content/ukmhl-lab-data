104 CELLULAR SYSTEM. excrescences understood by the names of fungus hypersarcosis, medullary sarcoma, &c. are no- thing more than the result of this exuberant growth of cellular tissue, which has exceeded its usual limits in the process of cicatrisation ; ac- cordingly, the cicatrix cannot be formed of these productions, nor can consolidation take place till they are suppressed. But it is in different tu- mours especially that we observe this develope- ment of cellular tissue. The fungous tumour, a species of production that strikes root exclusively in the mucous membranes, sinuses, fossae, nasali, mouth, and especially in the uterus, and which differs strikingly from such tumours as have their seat in the fibrous membranes, as the dura-mater for instance, although they are comprehended under one common denomination, all fungus ex- crescences, I say, are composed of cellular tis- sue, and have moreover a peculiar matter depo- sited in their cells, which, according to the quan- tity in which it is secreted, leaves its primitive basis more or less exposed. The polypus, whether of the mucous or sarco- matous kind, a species of tumour that belongs to the mucous system, has the cellular tissue also for the primitive basis of its organization. The different modifications of cancer manifest this more or less strikingly, by the enlargement of the parts which they occasion. It would be ne- cessary to run through the whole classifications of

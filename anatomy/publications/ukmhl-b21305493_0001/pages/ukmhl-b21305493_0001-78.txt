XXXV111 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 3dly. The distinction of diseases into organic, or such as affect the tissue of organs, and those which leave it unimpaired, is likewise essential here. The first have indisputably their seat in the solids. 4thly. The distinction into acute and chronic diseases, has also its share of importance. Lastly.-Another, not less important, must be made, namely, that of the diseases which are independent of any principle inherent in the economy, and these which proceed from those of a similar principle, as when syphilitic, scrophulous, scorbutic, or herpetic affections are exerting their baleful sway throughout the system, and in- vade the different organs in succession. However slightly we may consider diseases under their different aspects, we shall perceive that what is applicable to one class is not so to another. Wherefore it is abundantly obvious that we must not generalize the question, as has been done even at the present period, that an ex- clusive theory of the solids or fluids is as glaring an absurdity in pathology, as a theory assigning action only to the solids or fluids would be in physiology. There are two errors we have equally to avoidâ€”the one that of particularizing, the other that of generalizing, too much. They conduce both in an eminent and the same degree to false consequences. Although vital properties have their especial

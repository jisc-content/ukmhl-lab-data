254 NERVOUS SYSTEM life, they had frequently laboured under such affections; but it is evident, they might proceed from the ganglions,andfrom the epigastric plexus, without these being affected in their structure, in the same manner as numberless cerebral diseases leave no trace in the brain. This point merits a particular inquiry. It does not appear that the texture of the gan- glion is surrounded by a peculiar membrane. The adjacent cellular membrane, only, is seen to con- densate, and afterwards to acquire a considerable consistence and firmness around these organs. It there assumes the nature of the sub-mucous, sub-arterial tissues, &c.; and in no instance does it contain any adipose matter. Ganglions, then, as well as arteries, under the subjacent part, mu- cous surfaces, &c., are provided with the two kinds of cellular tissue, which we have mentioned in treating of the organization of that tissue, and which differ so essentially from each other, both in their nature and properties. It is the second kind, that is analogous to the sub-arterial tissue, &c. which constitutes the peculiar membrane admitted by some authors. On examining attentively the interior of gan- glions, we may also ascertain that they possess but a very small quantity of cellular tissue. I have in all instances always found it destitute of fat: Alkalies do not form a soapy matter, as around the cerebral nerves, when immersed in their solution.

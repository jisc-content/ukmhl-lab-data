674 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. SECTION T. Origin of the Absorbents. The origin of the absorbents can with difficulty be demonstrated by inspection ; they are in this respect similar to the termination of the ex- halants. Such, in fact, is the excessive tenuity of these small vessels at their origin, that in almost all parts they escape unnoticed, even to the eye, assisted with the best optical instruments. Pores, in fact, are perceived in some parts; but it is difficult to show if they are absorbents or ex- halants. The origin of the first must then be estab- lished by the phenomena they produce in different parts. Wherever absorption is carried on, it is evident there they begin. Now, oA examining attentively the phenomena of absorption, it is ob- served wherever exhalations exist, so that the same table might serve for both.

NERVOUS SYSTEM 228 At that epoch it is then correct to say, that the lungs and the brain influence each other, the former by conveying red blood to the second, by exciting to action the diaphragm and the in- tercostal muscles, which force into the other that portion of air indispensable for the re-pro- duction of red blood, From this we perceive that the other excitements are prior to that of this blood, since, before its formation, the brain must have been a principle of motion. However, the brain and the whole nervous system are so much more powerfully excited by the additional principles the blood has borrowed from the air; because, 1st. Their vessels are pro- portionally more extensive, and more numerous than afterwards; because, 2dly. All the cerebral arteries resort to the side of the basis of the cra- nium where, on one part, is the origin of nerves, and which on the other part is indisputably the most sensitive part in the whole organ. There is undoubtedly a very material difference between asphyxia which occurs in the adult, and the state of the foetus; since if the first be conti- nued, organic life ceases, wh ilst this life is all activity in the foetus. Thus the dark blood of the arte- ries in asphyxia, and that in the arteries of the foetus, by no means bear any resemblance with each other in their composition ; however, a kind of analogy actually does exist in these two cases, particularly in respect to the remarkable dimi-

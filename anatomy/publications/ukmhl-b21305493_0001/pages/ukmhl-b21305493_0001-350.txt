The communication between the parts through the blood vessels has also been admitted as a cause of sympathies. Some have accounted for them from the continuity of the cellular membrane ; others again from that of the mucous membrane. I shall not apply myself to refute partially these different hypotheses : I shall merely remark, that if one single instance of them is not applicable to every case of sympathy, it is because these aber- rations of the vital forces have been regarded in a too general sense. It has been believed that they were governed by an individual principle, and this principle has been sought after. But to ascertain the cause which produced sympathies, it is indispensable to divide these as I have done the vital properties ; because, in the same manner as each of these properties admit of distinct phe- nomena, so must the phenomena which put them in motion also differ. To make this distinction of sympathetic very palpable, let us suppose a diseased organ, the stomach for instance; it then becomes the centre, from which pass numberless sympathetica! irradiations, and which excite in other parts, sometimes animal sensibility, as when head-aches take place at that time; sometimes contractility of the same kind as

529 OF THE DARK BLOOD. grounded ? Why should not slowness of mo- tion be dispensed with in respect to this secretion as to any other ? 4thly. It is said, that after tying the hepatic vein, the secretion of bile was con- tinued ; but when the connections between the parts are known, the slightest reflection will be sufficient to conceive, that a ligature cannot be applied without being attended with that destruction of parts in which nothing further can be distinguished. I have attempted it once, but could not continue ; indeed I was almost convinced of this before. 5thly. It is also stated that the dark blood is better calculated to furnish the elements for bile than the red ; but in what ? Is it because this fluid has more hydrogen and carbon ? Then again, the dark blood must also furnish the fat; but all anatomists coincide in saying this substance flows from the exhaling extremities of the arteries: the same observation applies to the marrow, serum, and, in general, to every unc- tuous fluid. A fine injection of the hepatic part of the veinous system of the abdomen proceeds to the biliary vessels; but on injecting the hepatic artery, a similar occurrence takes place. 7thly. The dark abdominal blood, it is said, receives, in the spleen, qualities essential to the production of bile ; but the secretion of this fluid may evi- dently take place without the concurrence of the spleen. 8thly. It is said, that at the moment a ligature is applied to the vena porta, bile

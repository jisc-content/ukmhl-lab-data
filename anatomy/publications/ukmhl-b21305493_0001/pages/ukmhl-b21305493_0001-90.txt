GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 1 of texture which is wanting, or at least very imperfect in a number of organs, as in nerves, fibres, cartilages, bones, <&c. 4thly. by the action of fire and strong acids,â€”this is contractility by contraction, which is general. As soon as life has entirely forsaken the muscles, they no longer enjoy the two first kinds of contrac- tility, but the third is still remaining in them, as well as in all other organs that possess them. They also lose this, when they are dried, or are kept some time in water, but even then the fourth species is left them, which is the last that for- sakes animal textures, and might be perpetuated for years. After laying bare the cartilaginous parenchyma of bones found in the cemeteries, I have found them visibly contracted on being ex- posed to fire. I am convinced that this faculty would exist for ages if organic texture could be preserved. Contractility is then, it appears, a common and general property, inherent in all animal tissues, but which, according to the manner it is excited, offers modifications strongly marked, between which there is no analogy. It is obviously impossible not to make a distinction between the four I have described, or to mistake the insen- sible contraction, viz. that kind of oscillation, which during life constitutes insensible organic contractility, or the tonic motions. Among the agents that determine such an

OF ANIMAL LIFE. 125 spect to intellectual phenomena, all of which re- fer to the cerebral mass. Many animals, on the contrary, are superior to him in respect to mo- tions, and the four senses of taste, smelling, hear- ing, and sight. It is to be remarked, however, that in the perfection of the fifth sense, that of touch, he excels them all. Why ? Because this sense is quite different from the others, that it is consequent to them, and rectifies their errors. We feel, because we have seen, heard, tasted, or smelt the objects. This sense is voluntary; it supposes reflection in the animal which exercises it, whilst the other four require none. Light, sounds, &c. strike their respective organs unno- ticed by the animal, whilst he will feel nothing without a preliminary act of the intellectual func- tions. fs It Anot then astonishing, that in man the perfection of the organs of touch, and the extensive developement of the brain, should be in the same proportion, and that in animals where the brain is more contracted, feeling is more obtuse, and its organs less perfect.

340 VASCULAR SYSTEM unites them to the adjoining parts, facilitates their motions, and is not at all distinct from the re- mainder of the cellular system ; the other, dense, tight, deprived of fat, is composed of filaments, in- stead of layers, and forms their first tunic. We have mentioned, in speaking of the cellular system, that particular layer, which incloses the arteries, com- monly called by authors cellular tunic, by the ancients nervous, on account of its whitish as- pect, and which is perfectly analogous to the sub- mucous, sub-excretory, cellular texture, &c. dif- fers essentially from the preceding, as well as from that which is in the interior, around the organs, or in their interstices. It is these two kinds of cellular texture, parti- cularly the latter, that especially concur in main- taining the folds of the arteries: thus, it happens, that whenever the proper tunic has been accu- rately dissected, these folds completely disappear. However, when on the one part they are strongly depicted, and on the other they are not fre- quently liable to disappear, to accommodate the extensions of the parts, as in the canal of the in- ternal carotid, I have noticed that the arterial fibres are adapted to these folds, that they are more numerous on the convex than on the oppo- site side, so that, the thickness of the artery is every where exactly the same, which would not be the case were it not for this disposition, because more being pressed to the concave side, the artery

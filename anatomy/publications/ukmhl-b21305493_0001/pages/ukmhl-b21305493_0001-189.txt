47 CELLULAR .SYSTEM. the serous surfaces and organs, having extensive motion, &c., but is wanting, as we have hereto- fore stated, in the penis, prepuce and scrotum, &c. It is also deficient in the mucous surfaces, about the arteries and veins, &c. Its quantity varies in the structure of various organs : we find none between the coats of the arteries and veins, none in the lymphatic glands; none in the brain and medulla spinalis, &c. It is however always found between the filaments of nerves, although it is very indistinctly seen, but we find that their fibres in drying allow an oily exudation to escape, which occurs invariably, and is evidently pro- duced by it. It is generally found in some quantity in muscular fibres, particularly in those of animal life; we scarcely see any in those of organic life. In bones, which are destitute of it, it is replaced by the medullary juice; cartilages, tendons, and fibro- cartilages, are almost wholly unprovided with it. It is sometimes observable in certain parts of the glandular system, as in the parotid gland, the pel- vis and the kidneys, but in others we find no ves- tige of it, as in the liver, and prostrate gland. The serous and cutaneous systems have no adipose sub- stance in them although surrounded by it. It is not found in the epidermis nor hair. From the foregoing hasty sketch, it is evident that the internal structure of organs, contains com- monly but an indifferent proportion of fat. The appendages of viscera themselves have but little

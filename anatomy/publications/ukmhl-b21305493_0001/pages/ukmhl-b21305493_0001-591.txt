449 OF THE DARK BLOOD. the capacity of the sum total of their divisions is oreater than that of the trunks. to In this respect, however, an observation ought to be made; it is, that in veins the connection be- tween the trunks and their divisions in the veins is never so very exact as it is in the arteries. Thus, the sum total of some divisions greatly ex- ceed their trunks, whilst this connection is far in- ferior in other instances. But all this again de- pends upon the excessive variations of the veinous coats, according to the quantity of fluid they con- tain ; thus, in the dead body, in some instances, the branches are found excessively dilated by the blood, the trunks remaining in their natural state, whilst on other occasions it is quite the re- verse. 1st. This last especially takes place when the lungs are affected; in this case, the blood re-flows in the right cavities of the heart, and from thence into the large corresponding trunks of the veins; these are in such cases found almost to equal, or even to exceed the divisions they sometimes fur- nish. 2ndly. When in the living subject a limb has been kept for some length of time in a per- pendicular direction, then the branches become more dilated than the trunks; but as these causes of dilatation vary considerably, such dilatations must also vary. From such variations in the separate dilatations of the branches and trunks of the veins, it is evi-

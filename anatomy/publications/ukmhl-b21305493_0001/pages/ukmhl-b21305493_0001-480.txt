338 VASCULAR SYSTEM SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Vas- cular System, of the Red Blood. Blood Vessels. The parieties of the arteries contain secondary arteries, intended for their nutrition. These vessels generally proceed from the neighbouring ramifi- cations, sometimes from the very artery itself, whose capillary divisions terminate in the texture of its coat. This is demonstrated in the heart; at its exit the aorta furnishes the coronaries that plunge in the texture of that organ, and extend on the origin of that artery itself. The bronchial arteries supply the parieties of the pulmonary veins. In the arterial texture, where the minute arteries should be particularly examined, they first wind in the external cellular texture of the artery, ramifying together in a thousand different directions, sending some divisions to the adjoining organs, and a considerable num- ber that plunge into the proper membrane, interweaving between its lamellae, to which it distributes some twigs, and finally, terminating before they reach the internal membrane. I have never found, either by injections, nor by opening an artery in a living animal, after

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 62 SECTION I. Tissue peculiar to the Organization of the Cellular System. Much has been written on the nature of this tis- sue. Bordeu has advanced some very vague ideas on this subject, unsupported by any experi- ments. Fontana has made many fruitless re- searches in respect to its intimate structure and the tortuous cylinders, of which, according to this author, it is entirely compounded. Let us dis- miss all such hypotheses as are not confirmed by minute inspection ; let us follow nature in those phenomena of structure that she reveals, but not in those that she conceals from our sight. Accordingly, in thus considering the cellular tissue, we find it to be perfectly distinct from that species of gluten to which some authors have been pleased to compare it; it is an as- semblage of innumerable whitish threads, that are ramified over the thin laminae or plates that unite with these threads to form the cells. To acquire a perfect knowledge of its structure, we must take a portion of cellular tissue from the scrotum without fat, which might else conceal its textureâ€”draw it out into the thinness of mem- brane, and examine it in a favourable light. We shall then clearly distinguish a thin transparent

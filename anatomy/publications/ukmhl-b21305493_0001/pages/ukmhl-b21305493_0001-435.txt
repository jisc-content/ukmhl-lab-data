It is nearly between the upper and lower third of the body that the impelling agent or heart is situate. This position is by no means unimpor- tant ; it places under the immediate influence of this viscus the upper parts of the body, and particularly the head, in which all the organs, especially the brain, necessarily require an habitual excitement from the red blood, to maintain their function in permanent activity.

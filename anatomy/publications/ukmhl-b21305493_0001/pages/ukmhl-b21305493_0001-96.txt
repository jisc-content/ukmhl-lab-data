We find every one of the single tissues uniting more or less of these proper- ties in different degrees, and animated accordingly with more or less energy. But they do not only vary in the number of the properties allotted to them : when the same properties exist in several, they assume in each a peculiar and distinctive cha- racter. This character is chronic, if I may be allowed to express myself thus, in bones, cartil- ages, tendons, &c.; it is acute in the muscles, skin, glands, &c. Independently of this general distinction, every tissue has its peculiar mode of action and degree of sensibility, &c.: the whole theory of secretion, exhalation, absorption,and nutrition, is founded on this principle. Blood is a common reservoir, from which every tissue borrows and chooses its ma- terials according to the degree of its sensibility, and appropriates them to itself, retaining or re- jecting them subsequently. Much has been said since Bordieuâ€™s time, of the peculiar life of each organ, or that particular cha- racter which distinguishes the whole of the vital properties of one organ, from the vital properties of another. Before these properties had been pre- cisely and rigorously analysed, it was evidently im- possible to form a correct idea of this peculiar life. From the sketch, therefore, that I have just drawn, it is obvious, that as the greatest part of the organs

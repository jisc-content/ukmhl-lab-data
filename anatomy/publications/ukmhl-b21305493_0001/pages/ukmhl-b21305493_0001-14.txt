IV.—Of Vital Properties, and their Phenomena considered with respect to Solids and Fluids,—Division of fluids into those of compo- sition and of decomposition.—Vital properties are essentially seated in the solids.—These are the seat of almost every morbid symptom.— Fluids, however, admit of being vitiated.—Different attributes of the fluids of composition and those of decomposition in diseases.—How alterations in the former may occur.—Of those of the latter.—Cases wherein solids and fluids are primitively affected.—Division of dis- eases in this respect.—This question must necessarily be considered in different lights.—What is correct in one respect, is not so in the other.—Vitality of fluids.—This vitality explained.—It is disordered by their alterations.—New proofs of these alterations.—In what man- ner fluids are assimilated and altered - - xxx—xliii Sect. V.—Of Properties independent of Life.—Properties of tissue.— Of contractility by shrinking.—By what agency called into action.— There are two different species.—Characters of each.—Their diffe- rences.—Almost all the solids admit of contraction.—A few elements of fluids also admit of it.—Phenomena attending contraction.—Con- ditions required.—Contraction during life and subsequent to death.— Difference of this kind of contractility.—General remarks xliii—li Sect.

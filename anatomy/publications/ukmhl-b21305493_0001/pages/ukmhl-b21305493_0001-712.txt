570 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. To those who examine the dead body, I recom- mend these considerations as worthy of the great- est attention. Thus no calculation can be made respecting the quantity of blood that penetrates the pleura or the peritoneum in a state of inflam- mation, by that found twenty-four hours after death ; local irritation was a permanent cause that determined the blood to the part, and this cause no longer existing it consequently escapes. A serous membrane may have been considerably in- flamed during life, and present nearly a natural aspect after death ; it is the very same thing as in erysipelas. I should frequently, on dissection, have been induced to pronounce the non-exist- ence of an affection that had actually taken place. The same remark is applicable to the cel- lular tissue and mucous surfaces affected with in- flammation. If we only examine a subject who has died in consequence of angina pectoris, which, during life, had tinged of the deepest red, the arches of the palate, the palate itself, and the whole of the pharynx, we shall find, that, subse- quent to death, the parts have nearly re-assumed their natural colour. I shall observe, in this respect, that the acute affections ought to be distinguished from the chronic ; for instance, in chronic inflammations of the pleura, of the peritoneum, &c. the colour, after death, remains the same, because the blood has in some measure been combined with the or-

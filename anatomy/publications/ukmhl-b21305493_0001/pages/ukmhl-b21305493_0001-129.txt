lxxxix general considerations. Such is the sketch of the general plan I have adopted in my lectures. Such as have attended them will, notwithstanding, find some alterations and additions. We might easily introduce here all the facts that are brought forward in this work, if we were to refer them to one physiolo- gical classification, instead of distributing them in the anatomical order I have here submitted them. Although an impassable line of demarcation be drawn between every order of functions, the di- visions above must not, nevertheless, be taken in too rigorous a sense. The different orders are, more or less, intimately connected with each other, for instance, in the first class, when one order has ceased to exist, the other is soon destroyed. Thus I have demonstrated elsewhere, that the heart, which is the principal agent of organic life, being once interrupted, the brain, which is the central organ of animal life, is instantly interrupted also, for want of the natural stimulus it receives from it, and its functions are abolished. I have also shown, in the same manner, how the latter viscus, having respiration under its immediate de- pen dance, through the diaphragm and intercos- tals, which receive the cerebral nerves, has a direct influence on circulation, and therefore the whole organic life ceases when its action is inter- rupted. Under this head, I have represented res- piration as the true bond that connects animal

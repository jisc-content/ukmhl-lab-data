29 CELLULAR SYSTEM. The cellular tissue about the face varies with regard to quantity in certain individuals. It is well known that corpulent subjects are often remarkable for the thinness of the face. This I ascertained, by dissection in such subjects, arose from the scantiness of the cellular tissue in that part. We observe in other individuals, that the fulness and plumpness of the countenance is curiously contrasted with the slenderness and diminished bulk of the whole person, owing doubtless to the reverse of the reason which I have assigned for the first, although, I confess, its grounds may be liable to objection. To the increased proportion of this tissue rather than to the expansion of muscles, must be ascribed the peculiar thickness, which we remark in va- rious parts of the face in different nations, about the lips and alee nasi of negroes, &c. The same observation applies to the varieties that occur in the thickness of the lip. The chief communications between the cellular tissue of the face and the neck are effected by the sub-cutaneous portion of this membrane, by that which attends the vessels in their tract, and particularly in the triangular space, at the upper part of which the parotid gland is situated. Thus in abscesses of the cheeks, sinuses often extend to the neck. In emphysema, when the air proceeds from the thorax, after th,e neck is inflated, it rushes to the face princi-

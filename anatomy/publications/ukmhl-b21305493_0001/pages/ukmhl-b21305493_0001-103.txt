GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Ixiii When the phenomena of disease are the re- sults of morbid sympathy, they are governed by the same laws as when they proceed from imme- diate derangement. Much has been said of the sympathies of the stomach, intestines, bladder, lungs, &c. I defy any one to form a correct idea of them, if he refers it generally to the organ, without consulting the different tissues. 1st, When the muscular fibres of the stomach are thrown into irregular contractions, by the in- fluence of another organ producing vomiting, its effects are confined exclusively to the serous and mucous membrane, which would other- wise be the seat, the one of exhalation, the other of exhalation and secretion by sympathy. 2dly. When the action of the liver is sympathetically increased, and an unusual quantity of bile se- creted, its peritoneal capsule does not secrete any fluid, as it is not affected. It is the same with the kidneys and the pancreas, &c. 3dly. For the same reason, the viscera of the abdomen, which are all covered by the peritoneum, do not partake of the influence of sympathy, to which it is subjected when disordered. This is the case with the lungs and pleura, the brain and the tunica arachnoides, the heart and pericardium, &c. 4thly. It is certain, that in all spasmodic affections, the muscular fibre is alone affected, and not the ten- dinous. 5thly. What concern has the muscular membrane of the testis with the sympathies of its VOL. I. F

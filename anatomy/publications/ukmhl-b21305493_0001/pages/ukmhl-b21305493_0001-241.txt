CELLULAR SYSTEM. 99 which the wounds of internal organs are repaired is alike in all through this basis, and the only difference that is found between them exists in the fluid that is separated and remains in the cellular tissue. This fluid is in general the same as that which serves for the nourishment of the organs, and that which is taken to and from it in the performance of that function, accordingly, as each organ in the different systems has its own peculiar nutritive principle, so, each must have its peculiar mode of union. We should be as con- versant in the cicatrisation of the different parts as we are in that of bones, if the substances that nourish them were as thoroughly known to us as jelly and phosphate of lime : the manner in which cicatrisation takes place in internal organs is gene- rally analogous to that of nutrition, or rather it is the same, with this sole difference, that the cel- lular tissue shooting out into irregular granu- lations on the divided surfaces, does not of ne- cessity correspond to the figure of the organ that it serves to unite. Hence the irregularity of callus, &c. Such are the phenomena of the third stage of cicatrisation in internal organs, and closely do they resemble those that are manifested in the external organs, the membrane covering the gra- nulations becomes also a sort of exhaling organ that separates a whitish fluid called pus from the blood; but there is this difference, that instead

319 OF THE RED BLOOD. fibres adhere to the contiguous dense texture, seems to me to be very analogous with the origin of the organic muscular fibres, which in a great many parts are fixed to the sub-mucous tissue. Whenever a ramification projects from a trunk the circular fibres give way, and form on each side half a ring, from whence there results a complete ring, encompassing the smaller ones that form the circular fibres of the rising branch. These circu- lar fibres continue as far as the projection of the common membrane, as we see in the interior of the arterial cavity, and which we have already mentioned; so that the whole thickness of the peculiar membrane serves to support them at their origin. However, there is little continuity between the two species of fibres. Those of the branch do not proceed from those of the trunk ; it is the internal membrane, as well as some fibres of communication, that unites them together. Dissections display with the greatest facility these ingrafted branches, if I may be allowed this ex- pression, at their origin, in the ring formed by the yielding circular fibres. This is remarked at the origin of the intercostal and of the lombar arteries, in the aorta, &c. When two trunks divide in an equal proportion, as the iliacs, the last circular fibres of the primitive trunk they formed are in- timately interwoven with the origin of each of the circular layers, arising on a level with the projection that divides this origin. Thus, the

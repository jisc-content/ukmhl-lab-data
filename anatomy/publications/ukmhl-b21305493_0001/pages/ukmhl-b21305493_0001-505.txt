OF THE RED BLOOD. 3G3 rarely seated in this texture. This is also demon- strated by observation. 1st. Acute affections are seldom observed in the arteries. Amongst all the bodies I have opened, very few had traces of inflammation in the arterial texture. I must notice, in this re- spect, it is requisite to be very cautious in dis- tinguishing perfectly that redness which, as we have ascertained, is the effect of maceration, and even spontaneously produced in the corpse some time after death, especially in the cerebral arte- ries. This I say should be accurately distin- guished from that which is produced by jirsiiu miRlui In the one the arterial fibres are actually red ; in the other they only appear so from the injection of their vessels. Does inflammation attack the common membrane of the arteries in inflammatory fevers? Of this I am perfectly ignorant. These simple cases are so very rare, especially in hospi- tals, that there is little or no opportunity of opening subjects to whom they have proved fatal; but admitting that such inflammation is produced, the scarcity of these fevers in their simple state would prove how little arteries are subject to in- flammation. 2dly. Arteries are not more liable to chronic affections, excepting, on the one hand, aneurism, in which the arterial texture had un- dergone no change, but is merely ruptured, and in which its organic sensibility consequently acts h h 2

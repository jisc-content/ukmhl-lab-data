However this longitudinal resistance to distention is less than the lateral one opposed to injection ; experiments prove it, and the cause un- doubtedly is, that in th%*fcrst instance no fibres are directly opposed to the impression. This resistance of the arterial texture differing so much from that of the veinous, is a necessary consequence of the heart being situate at the ori- gin of the arteries. In fact, this organ, propel- ling forcibly the blood into their canals, requires in these a degree of strength calculated to resist the violent effort of which it is capable, whenever its sensible organic contractility is exalted to a high degree. This is the essential advantage of the arterial texture. What would become of circu- lation, and of every function depending thereon, if the slightest cause that might encrease the ex- ertion of the blood could dilate their coats beyond the natural limits ? It was indispensable that their texture should in some measure make them independent of the various degrees of motion of their contained circulating fluid ; from whence it ensues that a fleshy heart and resisting arteries are necessarily connected. Had nature doubled the energy of the heart, she would also have proportionally increased the arterial resistance. Arteries, on the contrary, would have possessed little resistance, had they not been provided with an impulsive agent at their origin. This is precisely the case with the hepatic part of the

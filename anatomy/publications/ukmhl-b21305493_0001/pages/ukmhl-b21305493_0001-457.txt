OF THE RED BLOOD. 515 .Finally, the systems of the cutis and epidermis, the cartilaginous system, &c., unprovided with arteries, contain in that division of the capillary system, seated in these parts, nothing more than white juices. ARTICLE III. Organization of the Vascular System of the Red Blood. SECTION i. Textures 'peculiar to that Organization. The red blood circulates, as I have said, within a membrane, disposed as a great canal, varying in its form, extending from the capillary system of the lungs to the general one, and dis- playing throughout the greatest analogy. The exterior of this membrane is provided by nature with a fibrous coating for the arteries, fleshy fibres for the heart, and a peculiar membrane for the pulmonary veins. Here I only intend to speak of the arterial coating. The fibres of the heart, and the membrane of the pulmonary veins shall be examined ; the first in the organic mus- cular system, the second in the system of the dark blood. As to the internal membrane of the ar- teries, which is the same in the whole system of the red blood, it shall be examined in a general point of view. e e 2

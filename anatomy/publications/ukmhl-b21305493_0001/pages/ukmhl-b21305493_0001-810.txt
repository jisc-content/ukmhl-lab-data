exiialant system. 668 exhaled upon the serous surfaces is subsequently absorbed ? I think it may be the case after in- flammation, although we have nothing positive on this head. Cruikshank and Mascagni have seen the blood absorbed by the lymphatic vessels, subsequent to wounds of the chest: why, then, should not what happens after hemorrhages through exhalation, also take place after those produced by laceration ? The cellular exhalants frequently pour blood into the cells. 1st. This phenomenon, in phlegmons, or other similar tumours, is sometimes very striking. On opening these tumours in the dead body, the extravasated blood is found in the cells: this is so perfectly true, that even some authors have set forth that the nature of inflammation consisted in this extravasation ; but it cannot be that in slight cases of phlegmon, the blood remains in the ca- pillary system of the cellular tissue ; it is only when inflammation is very intense, that this tran- sudation takes place. 2dly. In respect to the passive hemorrhages of the cellular tissue, we are aware that frequently the fluid of dropsical subjects is, in some peculiar parts, tinged of a red colour. We know that in scurvy, considerable parts of the cellular tissue are infiltrated with blood, which has certainly not been produced by erosion. I injected, not long ago, two subjects, the legs of which were covered

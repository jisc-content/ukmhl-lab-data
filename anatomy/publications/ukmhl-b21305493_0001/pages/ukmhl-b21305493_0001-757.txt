615 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. doubted ly because a greater quantity of air being admitted in a given time, the lungs would absorb more oxygen, and consequently, according to the opinion of chemists, more caloric would be produced ; but if more or less of this principle be presented to the blood, more is not absorbed. In natural respiration, the air contains a much greater quantity of this fluid than is received by the blood; when breathed in a pure state by an animal, the blood does not become redder, because no more than the usual quantity is ab- sorbed. In the same manner, if the gastric or- gans be loaded with four times the quantity of nutritive chyle, the lacteals reject the super- abundance ; the evacuations only are more co- pious, or the superfluity is discharged by vo- miting. The state of inspiration then does not interfere with the habitual heat of the body ; it contributes to it no further, than by introducing continually into the system a greater or less quantity of com- bined caloric. It is on this account that animals possessing respiration, are also possessed of more habitual heat. How can it be accounted for that animals, breathing very cold air, and living upon food, containing scarcely any caloric in the northern la- titudes, feel as warm as when under the torrid zone? because it is not the free caloric contained in the parts, but the combined, which being admitted

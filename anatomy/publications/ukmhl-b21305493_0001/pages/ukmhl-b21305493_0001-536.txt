VASCULAR SYSTEM 394 form but one, since the foramen ovale on the one part, and the arterial canal- on the other, establish between them a direct communication. This communication is the more remarkable as the subject is nearer to the time of conception. The more we approach the event of birth, the more these apertures are contracted. ]st. In the first months the foramen ovale is formed by two projections in the form of a cres- cent, their concavities directed towards each other, and leaving between them an oval space, gradually decreasing, because these two produc- tions gradually approach, tending to cross each other, which actually takes place after birth. 2dly. The arterial canal contracts, in proportion as the pulmonary artery dilates. As long as these two apertures remain free, which is constantly the case with the foetus, both systems, as I have stated before, evidently form but one; from whence it clearly results that the circulating fluid must unavoidably be of the same nature, and that there cannot be two different kinds in the foetus, as is constantly observed in the adult. This is, in fact, a remarkable distinction between the two stages. 1st. I have frequently dissected Guinea-pigs in the parentâ€™s womb ; their vessels have constantly appeared to me to contain the same fluid, which was of a darkish colour, as the veinous blood in the adult. This experi- ment is easily performed. The abdomen being

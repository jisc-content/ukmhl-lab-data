CA FILLARY SYSTEMS. 567 exhalants, and to the organs of secretion, it is evident, that from this manner of viewing the capillary system, all these vessels must unavoid- ably communicate ; that, in propelling a thin fluid into the arteries, it must, after having over- run the capillary system, flow from the excretory and the exhaling vessels, and be returned through the veins. This, in fact, is actually the case. In this respect innumerable points are constantly left open for the passage of the blood from the ves- sels, which openings also communicate outwardly with every part, and oppose in their cavities no mechanical obstacle to the blood, which is re- tained within the limits of its circulation^ by vi- tality only. The transudations of the dead body, in the exhalants, the excretory ducts, and the veins, are so well known from the numerous in- stances mentioned by anatomists, that I think it unnecessary to dwell any longer on this subject. We have seen very liquid injections when poured upon the serous membranes, the pericardium, the pleura, the peritoneum, &c. transude through the mucous surfaces, and even through the skin. They have been seen to flow through the ureters, the pancreatic, biliary, and salivary canals, &c. Haller, in mentioning each organ, never fails to produce a number of these instances, that prove the communication between the arteries and all the other vessels, through the means of the capil- lary plexus. What anatomist, in fact, has never

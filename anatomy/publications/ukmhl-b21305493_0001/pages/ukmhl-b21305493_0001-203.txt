CELLULAlt SYSTEM. 61 throughout that which surrounds the arteries, veins, and excretories, it would equally have ob- structed the calibre of these vessels, and we must remark that its invariable defect in the sub- arterial tissue, is another proof contradictory of Hallerâ€™s opinion. Had it been accumulated in the cavity of the brain, it would have compressed this organ, on account of the resistance of the bony parieties of the cranium, &c., which do not give way like those of the abdomen when its viscera are full of fat. In the chest the diaphragm descends, and affords larger space to the lungs without any prejudice to them, when there is much fat secreted in the mediastinum. This remark, which is also applicable to the serum, explains an important phenomenon in diseases; namely, that the slightest quantity of fluid effused in the tunica arachnoides, is sufficient to disturb the functions of the brain, whilst a considerable accumulation in the abdomen or chest, is attended with no im- mediate danger.

ABSOBBANT SYSTEM. 70 Â°2 veins. Hence it is, that an isolated absorbent? filled with injection, may present either none, or a considerable number of these knobs, that prove, as we have previously stated, the exist- ence of valves. Where a branch joins a trunk, two of these folds are found at their junction; this is very remarkable in the thoracic duct, which, being injected from above downwards, presents a dilatation in the origin of every branch, because in these parts the valves have checked the course of the fluid. Rather scarce in the super- ficial system of organs enveloped in serous mem- branes, as on the convexity of the lungs, of the spleen, they readily admit of the transition of mercury from one division to another, and are assisted in their functions by the extensive anas- tomoses which these parts contain. Their use is similar to that in veins, namely, to accommodate the ascent of the fluid, and prevent its return; but they do not at all times completely fulfil this purpose, as some are frequently forced by injection. In dropsical cases, in which the absorbents are filled, on lifting up the skin, the transparency of these organs renders it easy to distinguish them, but they soon empty notwith- standing their valves, and then become imper- ceptible. Several anatomists, by means oi the thoracic duct, have inflated or injected, with other fluids, a number of lymphatic vessels, consequently, in opposition to the valves. All

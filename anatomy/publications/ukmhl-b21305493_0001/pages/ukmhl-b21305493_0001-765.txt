CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 623 the dark blood, gives rise to the red, that termi- nates consequently the pulmonary artery, and from which the veins of the same appellation arise. The capillary vessels, intermediate to the bronchial arteries and veins, are quite distinct from these ; they have no communication with them, and evidently belong to the general capil- lary system. SECTION i. Connections between the two Capillary Systems, the Pulmonary and the General one. By comparing the preceding system with the present, it is difficult to conceive how they can exactly correspond ; how the pulmonary can transmit not only all that is conveyed through the general system, but likewise all the lymph that is returned from the serous surfaces and cellular cavities, all the chyle admitted on diges- tion, &c. It appears impossible, at first, that these capil- lary vessels should maintain a constant and regu- lar equilibrium with those of the whole body in the balance of circulation. After some reflection, however, respecting the phenomena of this func- tion, the discordance will be fourd to exist in appearance only. Although the general capillary system is every

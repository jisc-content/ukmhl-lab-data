VI GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. in the living economy, some result from sensi- bility, and others from contractility, &c. Dark and inscrutable to the ancients, the laws of life did not begin to be w~ell known until, in the last century, Stahl had already remarked the tonic motions; but he had not generalized their influence. Haller made sensibility and irrita- bility his peculiar study ; but in restricting one to the nervous, and the other to the muscular system, this great man did not consider them in their true point of view. He made almost dis- tinct properties of them. Vicq dâ€™Azyr in his phy- siological division, denominated them functions, and classed them with ossification and digestion, Scc., that is to say, he confounded the cause with the effect. Thus, notwithstanding the labours of a host of eminent men, we perceive how much physiologi- cal sciences still differ from those of natural phi- losophy. In the latter, the chemist attributes all the phenomena he observes to affinity ; the philo- sopher, in his science, sees nothing but gravity and elasticity around him. In the other sciences, on the contrary, no one has yet ascribed (in a general manner, at least,) the phenomena to the properties from which they are derived. In the mind of the physiologist, digestion, circu- lation, and sensation, are not in like manner asso- ciated with ideas of sensibility or contractility, as the spring of a watch reminds the mechanic that ' it is elasticity, which is the primum mobile of its

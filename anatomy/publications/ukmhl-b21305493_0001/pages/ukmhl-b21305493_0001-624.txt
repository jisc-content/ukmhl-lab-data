VASCULAR SYSTEM 482 satisfied with having pointed out the distinctions between the arterial and veinous ruptures, until observation has thrown a light on all the causes of the latter. If it be remembered that the arterial fibres are very numerous, and always circular; that those of the veins, on the contrary, are longitudinal and sparingly distributed over their vessels, it will be conceived why the first are less easily distended in the direction of their diameter, than in that of their axis, and why an opposite phenomenon, although less obvious, is observed in the latter. Contractility. This corresponds to extensibility. It is much more obscure in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction. 1st. It produces the contraction of the parieties of the umbilical vein, and of any trunk whatever, when a ligature has been applied, &c. 2nd. It is this which, when a trunk is punctured, causes the sudden flow of blood contained be- tween two ligatures. 3rd. It appears to have a marked influence upon the blood drawn by bleeding. 4th. The numerous varieties in the calibre of the veins of the dead body, according to the quantity of blood they contain, evidently pro- ceed from the extensibility and contractility of the texture.

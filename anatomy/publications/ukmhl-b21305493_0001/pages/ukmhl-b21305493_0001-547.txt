OF THE RED BLOOD. 405 yxiena of circulation, by admitting that there is a sudden change at the moment of birth. A pro- per investigation of the foramen ovale and of the arterial canal, at the different stages of pregnancy, is sufficient to show that they decrease progres- sively, and that the phenomena consequently occur in succession ; so that, if the foetus were to remain in the womb beyond the time prescribed by nature, and that contraction to be progressively continued in the foramen ovale and arterial canal, the circulation would be performed in the same manner as in the adult; that is to say, solely from the capillary system of the lungs, and that of the other parts. The only distinction would be in the uniformity of the colour, because it would proceed to the first system without having been placed in contact with the air. I do not intend to say, that the remainder of the blood that flowed through the arterial canal is not suddenly called to the lungs by the admis- sion of the air ; but undoubtedly this kind of sud- den deviation exists only in respect to a portion of the blood in the pulmonary artery. Previous to birth, a part of the fluid was already conveyed through the lungs, although its cells were empty. In general there is a constant proportion be- tween the quantity of blood the right ventricle conveys to the lungs, and that which the left propels to the inferior parts. The more the first increases, the more the second abounds: this last

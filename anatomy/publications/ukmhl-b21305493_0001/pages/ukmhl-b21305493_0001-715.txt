573 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. iitated it instantly becomes redder, the blood is determined to it, and as long as irritation is con- tinued it remains in the part, and retires when the cause ceases. Whatever may be the external agent that excites the cutaneous or mucous sensi- bility, the phenomena is the same. In this respect we have the power to determine more or less blood to any part of the capillary system. If the hand be placed near the fire, caloric will increase the sensibility of this system, and a larger quan- tity of blood is admitted; by withdrawing it this property is restored to its natural type, and the blood distributed in the usual proportion. The capillary system of the internal organs being less exposed to the causes of excitement, is not so liable to variations: many, however, are still observed, all of which arise from the same prin- ciple. A continuation of organized vessels cannot then be compared to an assemblage of inert tubes; the latter require mechanical obstacles to prevent the i termixture of the fluids : where there is a com- munication between the tubes, communications between the fluids must also naturally exist. In the living economy, on the contrary, it is the vitality of the tubes that forms the obstacle, and draws the line between the different fluids. This vitality fulfils the purposes of the different ma- chines we place between communicating tubes to separate them from each other. Every organ-

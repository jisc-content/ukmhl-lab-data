From this, it may be conceived why this organ has a firm and resisting texture, not admitting like the latter of being extended; a greater quantity of blood may sometimes pene- trate it, it may even weigh more or less, accord- ing to the nature of the death. But these- varieties appertain solely to the hepatic veins that open into the inferior cava, almost immediately under the heart; they depend upon the greater or less reflux that has taken place in that part, as well as in all the large veinous trunks, and are conse- quently connected with the state of the lungs; so that it may be affirmed, whenever this organ is so gorged with blood that the right auricle is distended, the liver also contains more of this fluid; but this phenomenon, which I shall exa- mine when speaking of the liver, does not relate to the system we are considering. The mechanism of this circulation is precisely the same as that of the veins in respect to their abdominal portion. With regard to the hepatic portion, it is the only one of the kind in the economy; it bears no analogy with that. of the arteries, since in these the heart is nearly all, and in the other there is nothing corresponding to that organ; for, as I have frequently ascer- tained, there is certainly no kind of contraction VOL. i. 25 s

OF THE DARK BLOOD, 465 the right and inferior longitudinal sinus, above in the superior, &c., and in short, in all those of the dura-mater. Hence, therefore, every sinus im- plies, 1st. A separation of the lamellae of the dura-mater. 2ndly. The <common membrane of the dark blood lining this separation. It is not then in the dura-mater itself that blood circulates, it is in the very same membrane in which it flows elsewhere; a fact, that is easily ascertained in the superior longitudinal sinus. This is triangu- lar, when considered only in respect to the sepa- ration of the lamellae of the dura-mater ; but when opened, it is evidently seen, that the common membrane in crossing over the angles gives them a circular form : this membrane is here very dis- tinct. In several other sinuses, it is easily re- moved from the dura-mater; but in most cases, it is intimately attached; it is similar to the union of the arachnoid tunic with the internal surface of the dura-mater. This common membrane of the dark blood opens upon the folds of the superior longitudinal sinus; it forms a very singular net work, which I shall describe, when speaking of the cavernous sinuses. From this general idea, it is evident that the parieties of the dura-mater serve in the sinuses for the veinous fibres, and the dense cellular tissue with which these fibres are outwardly provided : it is still the same common membrane, but the ex- ternal tissue is different.

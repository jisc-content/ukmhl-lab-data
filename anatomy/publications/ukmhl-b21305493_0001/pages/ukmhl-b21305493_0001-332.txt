190 NERVOUS SYSTEM the opinions of that eminent physiologist, should not be unconditionally admitted. All we know in respect to internal sensations is ; 1st, That there exists an organ in which resides the cause of sensation ; 2dly, That this organ trans- mits to the brain the particular modifications its vital powers undergo ; but we are perfectly un- acquainted with the means of communication between the one and the other. It is on this ac- count, that in my division of vital powers I have laid aside all systematical basis. The distinction of two species of sensibility, and of three spe- cies of, contractility, rests entirely on the observ- ance of facts; such is the obscurity in the phe- nomena of life, that I doubt, if from knowledge of nature, of the essence of vital powers, we can ever establish divisions. I observe, that between animal sensibility and contractility, this essential difference exists: in the first, the nerves are evidently in some cases the agents of communication between the organs that receive the impression and the brain which perceives it; but in other instances, we are igno- rant of the connection ; whilst, in the second case, it is evidently through the nerves that the brain communicates with the muscles, and the organs cannot perform a voluntary motion without the influence of the cerebral nerves. Let us confine ourselves to this general fact.

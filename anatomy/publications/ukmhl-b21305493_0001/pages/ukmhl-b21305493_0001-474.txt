332 vascular system What leads me to suspect this, is, that these very arteries, when deprived of blood, admit of very intimate adhesions of their internal surfaces, which their fluid should prevent, as that in the mucous tubes, which having ceased to transmit their re- spective matters, the excretions, for instance, se- creted fluids, &c. are never on account of this fluid found obliterated. Then, it seems that it is the very membrane it- self, and not a fluid proceeding from it, that is intended to secure the artery; in respect to the blood it can only be considered in this point of view as a kind of epidermis. It is this which, by its folds, contributes to form theAaorta, the mitral valves, and also the different projections at the origin of branches and ramifications. The external surface being, as we have seen, slightly united with the other membrane, has no intermediate cellular coat. Notwithstanding this slightness of adherence, no means whatever, ei- ther boiling water, maceration, or putrefaction, &c. will ever produce a separation of these two membranes, as with the periosteum and the bone, although naturally more firmly united together. The aid of dissection is always required. Respect- ing the nature of this common membrane I am perfectly ignorant, although differing in appearance it has in regard to properties the utmost analogy with the preceding envelopement. Neither of them can be arranged in any system ; they form

NERVOUS SYSTEM 266 mic is never met with in the course of the com- mon motor: they exchange branches which in- terweave, or rather there is a communicating branch existing between the ganglion and the cerebral nerve. In general, all these branches communicating with the system of animal life, are short, of a whitish hue, and of the same nature ; or at least, of the same appearance as the nerves of the last system. They form no plexuses in their course, seldom shoot forth branches, and seem calculated for no other purpose than to produce anastomoses between the two systems. 2ndly. Every ganglion sends branches upwards and downwards to the ganglions that are con- tiguous. We have already ascertained that the ophthalmic and spheno-palatine are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, also, as I have stated, there are interruptions in other parts. Let this be as it may, these general communications may induce us to consider ganglions as in every in- stance connected, and calculated to receive from each other the different affections of which they might have been originally the separate seat. These communicating branches are as straight as the preceding, sometimes very small, as those be- tween the lombar and sacral ganglions; at other times, they are more voluminous, as that which is intermediate to the two cervical, superior, and inferior; in other instances, they are very large, as the great splanchnic, which is the real trunk of

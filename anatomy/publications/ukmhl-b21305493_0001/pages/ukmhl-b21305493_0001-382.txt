NERVOUS SYSTEM 240 is observed between the pectoral and lombar por- tions of this pretended nerve, which, in this part, seem divided, because the last pectoral and the first of the lombar ganglions do not communi- cate. I have frequently observed the sympathe- tic nerve to disappear, and again spring up from the same cause between two ganglions, either in the lombar region, or in that of the sacrum ; 2dly. Every body is aware that the ophthalmic ganglion, the spheno-palatine, &c. are constantly found in an insulated state, and that they com- municate by means of their branches with the cerebral nerves only ; that the absolute deficiency of communication which is sometimes observed in these, constantly exists between those of the brain and the great sympathetic; 3dly. In birds, as Cuvier has ascertained, the superior cervical ganglion is always found insulated, it never com- municates with the inferior one; the filament which in quadrupeds descends along the neck is wanting. In many other animals, we often find that this series of anastomosis from the ganglions, which compose what is denominated the great sympathetic nerve, is frequently interrupted. 4thly. The communications of ganglions gene- rally take place by means of a single branch ; but sometimes several proceed from one of these organs to the other, so that if the great sympathe- tic were a nerve similar to others, it would, in this respect, present quite a different disposition to

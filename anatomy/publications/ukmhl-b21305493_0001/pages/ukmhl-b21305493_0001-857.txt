715 ABSOUBANT SYSTEM. SECTION II. Vital Properties, But little information has been obtained respect- ing the animal properties of the absorbents ; they do not appear to possess relative sensibility ; the at- tempt to prove it by experiments is attended with the greatest difficulty. When a lacteal filled with chyle is punctured, or a lymphatic filled with serum on the surface of the liver, or again, the thoracic duct, the animal gives no signs of pain. But what induction can be drawn from this, under the circumstance of the abdomen being laid open: admitting even that this sensation existed, how very light it must appear when compared with the continued and excruciating pains experienced in such circumstances. No experiment, I believe, has yet been attempted, to ascertain if irritation directed towards the interior of those vessels has produced pain, probably in consequence of the analogy of structure and continuity of the peculiar membrane; in both systems, the same result might be obtained from injections performed with this view, as from those made in respect to veins. There is one circumstance, however, in which the absorbents are keenly sensible, namely, in their inflammations. An obstruction and even a 3 g 2

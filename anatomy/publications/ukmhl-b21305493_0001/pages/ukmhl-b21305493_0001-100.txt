In post mortem researches, we find too that these membranes often escape in Inci- pient Phthisis. 6thlv. We frequently hear a common saying, a bad stomach, a disordered stomach ; but in general it implies only a certain condition of the mucous surface. Although this latter furnishes but a scanty and irregular secretion of the gastric juice, and the process of digestion is conse- quently impaired, its serous membrane and muscular coat exhale and contract in their wonted way. Thus, too, in ascites, where the serous membrane is discharging a redundant quantity of fluid, the functions of the mucous sur- face are frequently undisturbed, &c. Tthly. All authors have freely and largely discussed inflammations of the stomach, intestines, and bladder, &c. For mine own part, I do believe that at first, this disease scarcely ever affects the whole of these organs, unless in cases wâ€™here poison or other deleterious substances have acted on them. Acute or chronic disorder affects the mucous surface of the stomach and intestines; serous inflammation affects the peri- tonaeum, and sometimes in the intermediate muscular coat, we meet with a peculiar inflam- matorv affection which occurs but rarely ac-

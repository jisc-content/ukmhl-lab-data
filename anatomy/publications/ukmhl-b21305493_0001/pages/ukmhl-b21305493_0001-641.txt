OF THE DARK BLOOD. 499 rally the same in the arteries of the dead body; remarkable variation in the veins of the different parts; other phenomena proceeding from the unity of impulse in the former case, and from the various sources of movement in the latter, &c. In ascribing causes for the difference existing between the veinous and arterial circulations, seve- ral authors have strongly insisted, that the blood in arteries is propelled through tubes decreasing down to the capillary system, which is resistant, and that in veins, on the contrary, it flows through tubes gradually increasing up to the right auricle, which offers no resistance. The dark abdominal blood, however, is also circulated without an impulsive agent, through tubes gradually decreas- ing till they reach the capillary system of the liver, and its motion, however, is similar to that in the veins. Sympathies of the Veins. Sympathies in veins, like those in arteries, are very obscure. As the respective tissues of these two kinds of vessels are but seldom affected, and are not often the seat of inflammation and tu- mours, and therefore rarely affected with pain, we are but little acquainted with the influence they may possess over the other tissues. How- ever, at that period when the various transfusions in the vessels were generally considered, acid and

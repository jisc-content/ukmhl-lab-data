OF ANIMAL LIFE. 149 name that incloses the cerebral circumvolutions. To see this origin distinctly, the spinal membrane should be divided in a longitudinal direction both in the front and in the posterior parts. The mar- row then appears whitish, soft, and easily sepa. rable. If this be done either by scraping it with the scalpel, or with any other instrument, the immediate covering of the spinal marrow is obtained, perfectly distinct on either side, parti- cularly if the caution of washing it has been attended to. It might even be procured in the shape of a bag, by cutting a portion of the mar- row of a tolerable length, and afterwards by pressing the medullary substance through both ends. In this two-fold experiment, nerves will adhere to the membrane, divested of its me- dullary substance, because their sheath is con- tinued with it. It is exactly the same case as if a mass of minute arteries were given off from the aorta: the parietes of this artery would be to the nerves what the pia-mater of the spinal mar- row is to the theca of the nerves which proceed from it; with this distinction only, that nerves are white because they are filled with marrow, whilst the canal to which they are attached is transparent, because it/is deprived of this matter. I do not, however, pretend to say that there exists a perfect identity between these two mem- branes, since we are ignorant of the precise na- ture of either ; I merely point out the anatomical disposition.

VJ11 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. that ascend and descend, and are distributed in a thousand different directions, according to the forces that direct them. This continual motion of fluids has no dependanceupon physical properties; the vital ones, alone, direct it. Nature has en- dowed every part of the vegetable with the faculty of feeling the impression of fluids with which its fibres are in contact, and of re-acting upon them in an insensible manner to accelerate their course. I call these two powersâ€”the one, organic sensibi- lity, the other, insensible organic contractility. The latter is rather obscure in most vegetables, as it is in the bones of animals. These two proper- ties not only rule the circulation of the vegetable, which corresponds nearly to that of the capillary system in animals, but also its processes of secre- tion, absorption, and exhalation. Let us ob- serve, in fact, that these bodies have only such functions as are strictly relative to their proper- ties ; that all the phenomena, which in animals are derived frorh those that they hold in addition to vegetables, as circulation and digestion, to which circulation, sensible organic contractility is necessary ; the sensations to which animal sen- sibility is necessary, locomotion, and voice, &c., to which animal contractility is necessary; let us observe, I say, that these functions are entirely wanting in vegetables, since they have no vital properties to produce them. For the same reason, the catalogue of their

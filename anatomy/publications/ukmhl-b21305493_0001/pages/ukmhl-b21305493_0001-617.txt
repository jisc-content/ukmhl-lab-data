OF THE DARK BLOOD. 475 directions, and finally terminate towards the common membrane, which upon injection, has appeared to me to receive more of them than that of the arteries. Cellular Tissue. e The veins, like the arteries, are provided out- wardly with two kinds of cellular tissue, the one, which is external, and of the same nature as that found in the interstices of all the organs, is loaded with fat, with a very thin fluid, and is only in- tended to unite the veins and the adjacent organs; the other, dense and firm, forms their immediate tunic. In treating of the cellular system, this peculiar tissue has been noticed. No author has yet distinguished it from that which is generally ex- tended, and from which, however, it differs essen- tially in the filaments of its texture, its dryness, in the constant absence of fat and serum, its re- markable resistance, &c.; when stretched, by tearing it from the veins with the fingers, it has the appearance of an intricate net work. After having formed this outward covering to the veins, this cellular tissue, which is of a pecu- liar nature, analogous to the sub-arterial, sub- mucous tissues, &c., plunges between the longitu- dinal veinous fibres, separates them, supplies them with a kind of sheath, and terminates in the com- p p 2

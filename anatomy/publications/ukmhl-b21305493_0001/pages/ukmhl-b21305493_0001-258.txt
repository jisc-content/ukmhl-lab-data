116 CELLULAR SYSTEM. will be found at a further period. To be con- vinced of this the touch is sufficient. To its predo- minance and the excessive tenuity of the laminae is owing, that all attempts in the early months to create emphysema in the foetus, by forcing air under the skin, is hardly ever attended with success. At birth, and for some time after, the great proportion of subcutaneous fat renders it very difficult to produce an artificial emphysema ; it does not appear that the foetus is ever affected with emphysema naturally. Such at this period is the fineness of the cellular layers and filaments that the imagination cannot depict them, the texture of the hair is coarse in comparison. I presume that the mass of fat which I have stated almost always to exist in the cheeks of the foetus, proceeds from the rupture of several layers, whence a large cell, which fills with adipose mat- ter, is produced. Some time previous to birth, at that period, and in the ensuing years, the cellulary humour gradually decreases ; the cells become drier, con- sequently more distinct; the total mass of the cellulary system lessens, because as the organs gradually increase in bulk, the spaces they leave betwixt them grow narrower; however, this system predominates for a considerable time: from whence proceed the peculiar forms which characterise the infant; the slight projection of

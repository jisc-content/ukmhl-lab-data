310 VASCULAU SYSTEM or in cases of aneurism, where there is a spon- taneous obliteration of one of these vessels, anas- tomosis between small branches, either above or below this obliteration or ligature, are seen to carry on the circulation in the part. In such cases the collateral branches frequently become considerably enlarged ; but more frequently still the capillary vessels are nearly the sole agents by which the circulation of the blood is maintained. Anastomosis then implies a vitality in arteries. It is because these vessels are not inert, but act upon their contained fluid, that the phenomena of circulation are liable to such variations, that very often, particularly through the influence of the passions, spasm of their extremities, principally of the capillaries, forces the blood to return in another direction, which is favoured by anasto- mosis. This reflux is moreover indispensable in cases of inflammation or various obstructions in our organs, &c. How could circulation be performed if every ramification were to proceed separately to its respective destination? Would not the slightest stoppage produce a fatal stagnation ? I have remarked, in this respect, that anasto- mosis affords us the first proof of a truth that we shall soon more particularly demonstrate; namely, that in the large trunks the blood is especially in- fluenced by the heart, and in the capillary system exclusively by the vascular parieties. In fact, it is because the vitality of arteries is all with respect i

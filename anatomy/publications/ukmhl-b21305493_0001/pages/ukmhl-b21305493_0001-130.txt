GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. xc with organic life, and have shewn why foetuses completely acephalous, and having nothing substi- tuted for the brain, cannot exist out of the uterus, &c. Every thing is linked and woven together in the animal economy. We exist safely within and without, but in two distinct ways, and one life cannot be totally preserved independently of the other. Accordingly, although functions - be studied abstractedly, their connexity should be kept steadily in view, when we consider them simultaneously in an active state. It will be observed that in descriptive anatomy, I have followed a classification almost analogous to that of physiology. The one however differs a little from the other, insomuch as the same organs are frequently subservient to several functions, and certain functions, such as exhalation, nutri- tion, calorification, have not, properly speaking, distinct and determined organs.

CAPILLARY systems. 575 only observe how readily all those of secre- tions, ^exhalations, absorptions, inflammations, ca- pillary circulations, &c., return to the same principles and flow from the same source by tracing each to their natural cause, in consequence of the various modifications of sensibility in the organs commissioned to perform them. On the contrary, let us observe the difficulties attendant upon each, when mechanical causes only were produced for their explanation. From what has been stated above, it is, then, evident, that, in the numerous varieties of fluids of which the capillary system is susceptible, in regard to the different parts of this system, which they fill, there are always antecedent variations in the sensibility of the vascular parieties, and it is from these varieties that the former proceed. It is in the capillary system especially, and in its circulation, that the varieties of organic sensi- bility in the vessels produce varieties in the course of the fluids; because, as I have already observed, in the large arteries and veinous trunks, in the heart, &c., the fluids are united into too considerable masses, and moved by a too power- ful impulse, to admit of being thus submitted to the influence of the vascular parieties. Thus, when nature intends to prevent the fluids from communicating in the trunks, she has provided them with valves, or other similar obstacles, situate

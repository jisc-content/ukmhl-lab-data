696 ABSORB ANT SYSTEM. examined in the vessels of a living animal, has also led me to think so. How then can it be ac- counted for, that this fluid can be the result of an assemblage of such different elements, namely, of those which constitute the mucous, the cutaneous, the nutritive absorptions, those of fat, &c. ? I grant, that the different substances admitted into the circulation of the dark blood through the thoracic duct, and the corresponding one, may be received in turns; that the lymph, fat, chyle may each have their particular moment to join the circulation, but this explanation is not sup- ported by any fact, and even then, the dispropor- tion would still be very considerable. A great number of distinguished anatomists have thought that the veins are capable of absorp- tion, and in respect to this function, they have associated them with the lymphatic vessels. Hal- ler, Meckel, and prior to them, Kaw, Boerhaave, were of the same opinion. Such names, un- doubtedly command a mature consideration of the arguments produced ; let us then proceed to consider them. 1st. The thoracic duct has been seen obli- terated, and yet absorption continued, since the subject survived; but as it had not been observed whether the great right lymphatic and accessory vessels were also obliterated, no conclusion can be drawn from this fact; besides, I do not think that the observations on this important point are

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 2 different points of view in which it may offer itself before we can furnish a complete picture of it. I shall then waive the consideration of the general system which is formed by the continuity of its different parts, and view it only with relation to the organs it surrounds, or contributes to form. I shall afterwards examine it, independently of these organs, in the spaces between which it is universally found. In short, its organisation, properties, connections with the other systems, and developement, will be the object of my re- searches. ARTICLE THE FIRST. i The Cellular System examined in respect to the Organs. The cellular system, considered distinctly, and with reference to all other organs of the living economy, presents two striking features; 1st. It forms an envelope or outward limit to the organs ; 2dly. It enters freely into the structure of each, and forms one of the essential bases of the same structure. Of the Cellular System exterior to every Organ. The various conformation of the several organs, produces two very distinct modifications in their connection with the cellular tissue that surrounds them. Sometimes, indeed, it only adheres to one of their surface?, sometimes it envelope! /

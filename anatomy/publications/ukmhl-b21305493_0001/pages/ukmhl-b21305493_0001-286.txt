144 NERVOUS SYSTEM occipital with the frontal, &c.; 2dly, Branches of the same nerve may unite in the same manner as the three portions of the trigemini; 3dly, Sometimes the two nerves of the same pair, or those of two different pairs, but proceeding from each hemisphere of the nervous system, may unite in the median line, as some instances of it are seen in the superficial nerves of the neck, in those of the chin, &c. This union does not take place in the abdomen, where the median line being entirely aponeurotic, contains no ner- vous branch in its texture. This anastomosis, which takes place in the median line, nÂ§ay per- haps explain why certain motions can still sub- sist in parts affected by paralysis. These kinds of anastomoses, however, are in general very rare. It is evident they cannot take place in the limbs; in the back of the trunk very few instances of it are ever perceived, and very few in the anterior part. If every pair of nerves produced them, it is evident that hemiplegia could hardly ever take place, since the sound part of the brain, or that of the spinal marrow, might influence through them the nerves of the afflicted side. Anastomosis, with the System of Organic Life. This termination bears a considerable analogy to the foregoing, since it proceeds from two nerves which unite at their extremities, and intermix in such a manner that it cannot be said where one

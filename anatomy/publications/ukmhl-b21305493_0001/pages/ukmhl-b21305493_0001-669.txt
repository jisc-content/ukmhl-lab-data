If we remove the liver of a living animal, and instantly examine the veins, we shall find they contain a species of blood similar to that of the other veins. 4thly. When the liver is cut in slices in a living animal, an analogous fluid will flow from the back part of this organ, excepting a few minute red streams furnished by the last ramifications of the hepatic artery; the result is quite different when the same experiment is ap- plied to the lungs. If the veinous blood of the abdomen undergoes some modifications in its nature in the liver, these certainly do not influence either the hue, the con- sistence, or the touch. The general opinion is, that the dark blood of the abdomen serves for the secretion of bile, and the hepatic artery is only intended for the nutri- tion of the liver : this opinion has been adopted by Haller: I have myself introduced it in my lectures; but I am far from considering it so strictly demonstrated as is generally admitted; the following observation will prove that it should only be received as a supposition, even an un- certain one. 1st.

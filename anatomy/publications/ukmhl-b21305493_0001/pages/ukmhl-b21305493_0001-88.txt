GENERAL CONSIDER AT IO NS. xlviii tendons, fasciae, and even bones, when deprived of their earthy matter by acids, will contract as well as muscles, skin, &e. This circumstance alone suffices to mark the contractility of con- tracting bodies separately from that of others, even thoâ€™ the distinction were not confirmed by other identifying proofs that 1 shall bring forward in the sequel. When a part suddenly contracts, it is reduced to less than half its original length, and is twisted in different ways. If withdrawn suddenly from an acid or boiling water, it will still be found con- tracted ; but draw it out, and it will lengthen and contract again after the elongation of its fibres ceases ; so that it has assumed actual elasticity by contraction. This elasticity is remarkable in nerves, tendons, muscles, &c. which were entirely devoid of it, before the mechanical effects of contraction ; nor is it the result of slow and progressive con- traction produced by alcohol, neutral salts, &c. If we macerate organized substances for a cer- CD tain length of time, they will, by degrees, lose the power of sudden contraction, which never- theless is only completely destroyed when ma- ceration has reduced them to a perfect state of putrescency. If in this state of contraction, tissues are soften- ed by boiling water, and drawn out to their usual length, contraction can no longer bo produced, whatever the agent employed may be.

680 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. dst. In the extremities, they instantly divide into two very distinct layers ; the one superficial, the other deep. Those of the first layer imme- diately accompany the sub-cutaneous veins, and twine in the interstices, so that when- ever injections have proved successful, the whole external part of the limbs appears enveloped by a lymphatic coating. Those of the second entwine in the muscular in- . terstices, chiefly in the course of the arteries and veins : both of these divisions are directed to- wards the upper parts of the extremities; their vessels approach and unite into a bundle, in which they are less numerous, but larger, and which, having passed through certain apertures, proceed within the trunk ; for instance, nearly all those of the superior extremities are united in the axilla: those of the inferior in the groins, and some in the ischiatic foramen. Now as it is a general rule that all the absorbents should cross one or several glands, nature has provided the communica- tions between the limbs and the trunk with a certain number of these glands. Some, however, before they reach them, have already crossed similar glands, situate, though in a smaller number, in the ham, and in the fold of the arm. It is in the extremities, the absorbents are seen to pass to the greatest distance without crossing glands. 2dly. In the trunk, the absorbents at first form two layers; the one sub-cutaneous, the other

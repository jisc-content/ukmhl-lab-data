This tissue is more or less dense; the superficial glands are more solid, and resist the injection of mercury much better than those deeply situate ; they contain cells in different parts, especially in the infant, and a whitish fluid, that together with the cells disappear as age advances. This fluid of a peculiar nature, can be compared only with those of the thyroid and of the thymus glands, which, like this, are, as it were, extravasated in the space that separates them, they are unprovided with reservoirs, and their use is quite unknown. The great quantity of blood with which the lymphatic glands of the infant are imbued, is, no doubt, connected with the superabundance of this fluid. In the adult, a great quantity is still found in the bronchial glands, where it is of a dark colour. Some physiologists have admitted, but without the support of anatomy, that it partly contributes to X form the black saliva expectorated on rising in the morning. Fourcroy, in particular, is of this opi- nion ; he attributes much importance to the black hue of these glands, that might be, according to him, the reservoir of the carbon of the blood. The fact is, they belong to the lymphatic sys- tem ; that in a great number of subjects they are found either of a greyish or of a reddish colour ; that we know of no excretory organs belonging to them ; that their tissue is of a pulpy nature

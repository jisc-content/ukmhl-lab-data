VASCULAR SYSTEM 368 altered. Now, the very reverse is ascertained. On the other hand, all organic diseases of the heart evidently disturb pulsation. Whenever there is an increase of the fleshy fibres, as in cases of aneurism, when the left ventricles become so thick, the pulse is strong : it is irregular, if the obstruction be seated in the mitral or aortic valves. If in an aged subject, ossification be merely confined to the arterial system, pulsation is undisturbed : if it exist at the origin of the aorta, or in the very heart itself, the pulsation is irregu- lar. An artery might form a continued long tube, through which the blood would circulate as usual, admitting of no other distinction than that of pulsation. What I have said in respect to the chronic affections of the heart, must also be re- ferred to the acute diseases of that organ. Syncopy stops its motions and pulsation ceases. Certain passions, as fear, anger, &c., seem to act as stimu- lants to that organ,â€”what follows? they increase the action of the arteries. All inflammations of the pericardium affect the pulse. This membrane, subsequent to inflammation, frequently adheres to the heart, at the same time the plura adheres to it also on both sides; so that it might be said, that the lungs and the heart form but one organ. I have seen four cases of this nature, in which the motions of the latter organ must have neces- sarily been very much limited. In these cases, the pulsation was low, irregular, and intermittent.

The exposition of the following systems will display the different kinds of terminations in re- spect to nerves. 1st. In some, many of these are met with, as in the mucous, in the dermoid, and in the muscular systems of organic and animal life. 2dly. In others a smaller number is observed, as in the cellular, the glandular, &c. 3dly. Some of them require a more minute examination than that which has hitherto been made, in respect to nerve, with which we are little acquainted, as the serous, the medullary, and a part of the fibrous, &c. Finally. Several, as the cartilagin- ous, the fibro-cartilaginous, those of the hair, the epidermis, the tendons of the fibres, &c. are evi- dently deprived of nerves. We are still ignorant of the manner in which each filament terminates. Does it divest itself of the theca ? Does the pulp only penetrate the inte- rior of the fibres? In the optic nerve this last dis- tribution is evident. The theca terminates on en- tering the eye, and the pulp expands, to form the retina. A similar expansion seems also to take place in the olfactory and auditory nerves; but in respect to the others, nothing has yet been as- certained.

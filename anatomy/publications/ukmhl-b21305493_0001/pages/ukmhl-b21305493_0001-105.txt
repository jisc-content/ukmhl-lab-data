general considerations. lxv the general constitution : they alternately assail the various tissues according to the relation that exists between them and the organic sen- sibility of the latter. Thus they almost always attack particular parts, and never the whole economy of one organ: what do I say? If twq of these diseases exist at the same time, it is possible for them to exist separately in two sepa- rate tissues. Thus, the stomach, intestines, lungs, &c. may be simultaneously affected by two dis- tinct morbid actions, and such as are perfectly in- dependent of each other, because they reside individually in separate textures, the one in the mucous, and the other in the serous, &c. Let us not, however, exaggerate that indepen- dence which exists between the various tissues of an organ in respect to disease, or we shall be deceived in practice. The cellular system is not only a medium of communication between dif- ferent parts of the same organ, but also between different organs. Thus, in many chronic diseases, parts of the same organ are diseased by degrees, and the whole of its structure is found disor- ganised after death, although one only of its tissues was originally affected. In cancer of the breast, a small gland at first is perceived to move under the finger; but, ultimately, the glands, cellular membrane, and skin are confounded, and involved in one promiscuous mass. The same occurs in cancer of the stomach, intestines and f 2

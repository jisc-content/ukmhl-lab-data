124 NERVOUS SYSTEM lateral nervous system is reduced to a passive state, the other being in activity as usual; some- times the system on one side assumes a degree of energy contrary to the laws of nature, and be- comes the seat of convulsions, whilst the other remains perfectly calm ; in both cases the phe- nomenon is sometimes general. It is often con- fined to one or more of lateral organs; but al- ways draws a distinctive line between the two nervous systems, right and left. The kind of partial palsy I have just mentioned, and whose principal character results from the symmetry of the nervous system of animal life, is perfectly dis- tinct in this respect, from that in which the infe- rior part of the body is deprived of motion- by a fall upon the sacrum, or by any other similar cause. The proportions of size between the nervous system and the brain, in respect to man and the greatest part of quadrupeds, are, as Soemmering has observed, in a reversed state. In the first, the brain is much more voluminous than in the others, whose nerves are much more remarkable for their bulk than in man. In all animals gene- rally submitted to our experiments, it is easy to verify this observation ; it is even on this account that small dogs are very fit subjects, owing to the size of their nerves, for nice ex- periments upon sensibility. This difference is a striking sign of the superiority of man in re-

608 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. to supply nutrition, or from those intended lo provide for secretion or exhalation. The follow- ing, however, is the general principle : it may be divided into three parts:— 1st. Admission of caloric into the blood, with all the substances intended to repair its losses. 2nd. Circulation in a combined state of the calorie newly received. 3rd. Separation of this combined fluid from the blood to form free caloric, by the various alterations it undergoes in the general capillary system, on preparing the materials for the diffe- rent functions. The formation of caloric, then, is a phenome- non perfectly similar to those which take place in the general capillary system. In fact, in nutri- tion there are also— 1st. Combination of new foreign substances with the blood. 2nd. Circulation in the large vessels of these combined substances. 3rd. Separation of the nutritive substance to permeate the organs. In the same way the ele- ments of the secreted fluids are combined, circu- late in this state, then separate from the blood to be expelled: finally, in the same manner every exhaled fluid is combined, circulated with, and afterwards separated from the blood. From this it is evident, that, 1st. The admis-

In general, the veinous fibre, excepting in these parts, is remarkably scanty, and the mem- brane it forms is consequently very thin. In this respect, the membrane of the arteries far sur- passes that of the veins; it is the very tenuity of these last vessels that especially contributes to their extensibility. Let us observe that the struc- ture of each kind of vessels is calculated for its particular mode of circulation. If the blood were to circulate in veins provided with parieties similar to the arterial walls, at every instant its motion would be disturbed. In fact, numberless causes would produce obstruction in the veinous circulation ; whenever the motion is lessened, the capacity is increased, but the arterial textures not admitting of such dilatations, it is evident that circulation could not be maintained, consequently if the impulsive organ situated at the origin of the arteries requires in these vessels a firm tissue, incapable of extension, the slow motion of the blood in veins, and the frequent causes of delay, require an opposite nature in the tissue. What is the nature of the veinous fibre ? Its appearance, its want of elasticity, its great extensibility, the difficulty with which it breaks, its colour, its direction, every thing in short, con- curs to distinguish it essentially from the arte-

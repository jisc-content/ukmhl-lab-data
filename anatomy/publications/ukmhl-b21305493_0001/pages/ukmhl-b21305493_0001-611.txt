OF THE DARK BLOOD. 469 ino* a line of the same figure as this part of the to . valve : this protuberance sustains the valves in the same manner as that corresponding to the sigmoidal: it seems to be of the same nature as the veinous tissue, the fibres of which change their direction to form it. When the common membrane has reached this prominent line it folds to form the valve, so that it is apparently formed by two layers, which however are so thin, that they cannot be separated without the utmost difficulty. The veinous valves exist both in the superior and inferior vena cava. In the first, the divisions of the hypogastric, of the crural, of the tibial, of the internal and external saphenae, &c. are filled with them. The second affords numbers in the external jugular, in the azygos vein, in the facial veins, in those of the arm, &c. Seve- ral veins are not provided with valves, as may be observed in the trunk of the inferior vena cava, in the emulgents, in the cerebral sinuses, &c. The size of the valves is constantly proportioned to that of the trunks where they are found ; very considerable in size in the vena azygos, they are less so in the saphenae, and still smaller in those of the foot, &c. If their extent be compared with the diameter of the trunk they occupy, it will be found that sometimes they can completely obli- terate the cavity; at other times they are too nar- row to produce that effect.

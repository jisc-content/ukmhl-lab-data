391 OF THE RED BLOOD. of its trunk, locomotion is less striking in this part, because less resistance is opposed to the course of the blood. When an artery has been opened laterally, two opposite currents of the fluid are produced, which are directed towards the opening, and unite in a single stream. One of these is direct; the other proceeds from anastomosis. It is the very same thing as when an artery being divided the blood flows from both ends. If an artery be totally divided, a greater quan- tity of blood is produced in a given time than would otherwise have passed to the capillary system, which system presents more resistance. The rapidity of circulation ought not to be calcu- lated by the hemorrhage consequent to wounded arteries. Sympathies. W7e have seen that arteries, on account of the obscurity of their vital powers, are rarely the seat either of acute or chronic affections ; conse- quently they produce but very little influence on the other organs. Thus, with the exception of a few painful sensations produced by sympathy, and experienced in cases of aneurism, this in- fluence of the arterial texture over the other systems scarcely exists. In one or two instances I have perceived convulsive motions produced

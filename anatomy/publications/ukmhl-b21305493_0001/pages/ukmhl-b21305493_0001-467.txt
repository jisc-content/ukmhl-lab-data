OF THE !IEI> BLOOD. 325 agents on the arterial texture evidently prove how very much it differs from the muscular. There are then some general phenomena appli- cable to all the solids; but particular phenomena are very distinct. This fact may be ascer- tained by comparing the following chapter with that corresponding to it in the muscular system. Action of the different Agents on the Arterial Texture. That of air, by drying the arteries, gives these vessels a reddish yellow hue, rather deep, even blackish in large trunks, lighter in the smaller ones. Thus dried, the arteries are nearly as firm as cartilages in the same state; extremely brit- tle, the large trunks break with a perceptible ^ noise, of which no other texture in the animal economy affords an instance. It is, particularly by this process, that the cellular texture of ar- teries differs from their proper membrane. This coating remains slack; it is of a whitish-/ aspect when removed separately. When again immersed in water the arteries re-assume, in part, their natural disposition. By desiccation, arteries do not lose much of their bulk, a phenomenon tlat distinguishes them from the greater part of the other textures. This de-

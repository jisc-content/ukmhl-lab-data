Ill GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. diminutiveness threatened to conceal them for ever from the sight, we shall every where find on one hand the physical, on the other the vital properties, all put in motion; we shall every where see inert bodies gravitating one upon the other, and exerting mutual attraction; every where living bodies gravitating also, but feeling and experiencing moreover a motion which they owe only to themselves. These properties are to that degree inherent in both, that we cannot conceive bodies without them. They constitute their essence and attribute : nor can they exist without enjoying them. Deprive them of these, at that instant all the phenomena of nature cease, and matter exists alone. What was chaos? Matter without properties. God, when he created the universe, endowed it with gravity, elasticity, affinity, &c. and animated a portion of it with two instinctive principles, sensibility and contractility. This method of describing the vital and physical properties, sufficiently denotes that we need go no further in our explanations, that they afford the principles, and therefore that these explanations must be deduced as so many consequences. Sciences, both physical and physiological, are composed of two things; 1st, the study of phe- nomena, which are the effects; 2d, the investi- gation of the connections that exist between them, and the physical and vital properties which are the causes.

OF THE RED BLOOD. 373 powerful organ is evidently required ; now that organ is the heart. 9th. How could the pulsation in every artery be simultaneous, if that pulsation were not go- verned by a sole central agent ? The whole ar- terial system suddenly impressed by the same stroke, rises and pulsates at the same moment. Is it not evident, that if the arteries contracted of themselves, the least derangement in one of the parts, the slightest pressure, &c. would unavoid- ably produce a discordance in their motions ? 10th. No animal has pulsations unless he is pro- vided with a heart, or a fleshy organ, distributed in knots, and divided by necks, as that in several insects; besides, have the pulsations of these sub- stitutes for the heart been properly investigated ? Thus it is that pulsation is never seen to exist in the system of the vena porta, notwithstanding that its hepatic half is disposed as the arteries. 11th. Blood flows from the two ends of a divided artery; but this is occasioned by anastomosis, and not, as I myself once thought, by a re-action in the end opposed to the heart. It is thus that an artery may sometimes beat below a ligature. 12th. 1 readily admit, that without the assistance of the heart the red blood might possess, in its great canal, a kind of motion ; but that motion would be similar to the circulation of the vena porta, perfectly destitute of pulsation. 13th. Instances are produced in which the mo-

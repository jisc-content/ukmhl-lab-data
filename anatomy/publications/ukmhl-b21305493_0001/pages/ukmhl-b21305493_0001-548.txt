VASCULAR SYSTEM 40G is evidently the greater part of that which enters the upper parts of the body. These three thingsâ€”1st. The quantity of blood in the inferior cava, which unites with that from above, and passes into the right auricle. 2nd. That, which, proceeding from this ventricle, crosses the lungs, and is returned into the left auricle. 3rd. That portion which, from the left ventricle is projected to the aorta descendens, gradually increase as the foetus approaches the period of birth. The aorta descendens undergoes in its capacity no changes whatever in consequence of these deviations. In fact, whether it receive the blood from the arterial canal, or this fluid be directly transmitted from the left ventricle through its origin, it is the same in respect to this artery. Its parieties continue to increase in an uniform manner: the whole depends upon the gradual contraction which the arterial canal and the foramen ovale undergo. In general, the whole of the vascular system is, in respect to its great developement, very remarkable in the foetus. The arteries are pro- portionally much larger: this answers to the size of the heart, which, at this age, is very much developed; their comparative state being nearly the same as that of the nerves and the brain. The developement of the arteries, however, is not, like that of nerves, nearly uniform in all its

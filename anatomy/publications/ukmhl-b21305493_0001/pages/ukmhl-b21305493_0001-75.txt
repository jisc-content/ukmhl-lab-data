XXXV general considerations. are received into the system contrary to the na- tural order of the economy, as when bile or urine is absorbed into the circulating mass, &c. From what has been said, it is evident that diseases, or the combination of symptoms that characterize them, can be only understood by studying the principles which have produced, or keep them in existence. Almost every symptom has a reference to the solids ; but the cause may exist in the fluids as well as in them. We may mention a striking example of this in unnatural contractions of the heart, which arise : 1st, be- cause its organic sensibility is increased, while the blood remains the same : 2dly, because the blood is either increased in quantity, as in plethora, or altered in quality, as in putrid fevers, <&c. whilst its organic sensibility is unchanged. If there be double excitement, or the organ be twice as susceptible as it should be, the effect is always the same, and acceleration of the pulse follows. It is the solids always that play the principal part in diseases: it is the solids always that contract; but in the first case the cause is within; in the second, without. This example affords us an idea of what occurs in diseases. In all it is the solids that are espe- cially in action; but it is sometimes within, some- times without, that the cause of this diftion ex- ists. It would doubtless be a point of some im-

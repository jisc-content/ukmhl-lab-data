It is not the arterial tissue that has been influenced by passion ; besides, upon what could sympathies act in arteries ? It could not be either on the elasticity, or on the contractility of the tissue, which are however the only properties calculated to contract these vessels. Let us observe, in fact, that sympathies never excite more than one of the vital properties, because they are themselves purely vital phenomena. Every physical power or property of the tissue cannot take place under their influence : this is an observation of import- ance. Besides, as arteries are every where so distri- buted in the organs, that they form, as it were, a part of their substance, it would be difficult to distinguish what belongs to them, particularly in respect to sensibility, from what peculiarly ap- pertains to these organs.

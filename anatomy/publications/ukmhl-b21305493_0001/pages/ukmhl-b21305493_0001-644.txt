VASCULAR SYSTEM 502 capillary system of the foetus; this is the reason why the arteries are so large. A great propor- tion of the substances remaining in the organs for their nutrition, and but little being supplied by the general capillary system, for the secretions and exhalations, very little is also returned by the veins. The more the foetus is advanced in age, the greater is the quantity of blood in the veins. At first, nearly the whole remains in the organs, for their formation. Towards birth, every thing approaches nearer to what takes place in the adult. In this general phenomenon of the veinous sys- tem of the foetus, a proportion is always main- tained between the veins and the various parts according to the increase of the latter. Thus it is, that the greatest number of the superior parts, particularly the brain, being in this subject the seat of more active nutrition than the inferior parts, the veins in such situations are more con- siderable. The fibres in the veinous parieties, although undoubtedly existing, can hardly be discerned at this age. I have only remarked that their small vessels are proportionally much less nume- rous than in arteries, whose trunks are overrun with them, as may readily be seen on the aorta. The veins, although less dilated than subse-

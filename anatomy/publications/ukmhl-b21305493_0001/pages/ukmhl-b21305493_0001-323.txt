These questions puzzled me a great deal, being at that time engaged in surgery, and having applied myself little to physiology; but I have since been made sensible, that this depends upon the general principle I have already mentioned, and which proves, that in the same manner as every system, in regard to pain, has its peculiar mode of animal sensibility in the state of health, this mode also exists in that of disease. A very convincing proof of this assertion, in respect to the nerves of animal life, is the peculiar mode of pain which is felt in the tic douloureux, which is perfectly distinct from that of any other system. The sciatic pain, which exists in the nerve of that name, has frequently been mistaken for that of rheumatism that afflicts the muscles or the tendinous parts; but the difference of the pain would alone enable us to distin- guish them.

In no other organ of the body is a similar sensation produced by this cause. The animal sensibility of nerves has another

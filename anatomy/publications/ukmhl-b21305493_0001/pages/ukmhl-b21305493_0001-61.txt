GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Xxi same; that consequently they may be foreseen, foretold, and calculated ; the fall of a weight can be estimated as well as the revolution of a planet, the course of a river, or the ascent of a projectile, &c. The formula once determined, nothing more is required than its judicious application to indi- vidual cases. Thus, weights always gravitate by the sequence of odd numbers; attraction con- stantly takes place in the inverse ratio of the square of the distances. The vital functions, on the other hand, are subject to numberless varieties; they frequently exceed their natural degree, baffle all calculation, and would require as many formulae as the cases that occur. In their phe- nomena nothing can be foreseen, foretold, nor calculated ; we judge only of them by their ana- logies, and these are in the vast proportion of in- stances extremely uncertain. There are two things in the phenomena of life : 1st. The state of health ; 2d. The state of disease. On these two distinct sciences are founded:â€”phy- siology? which embraces the phenomena of the first state ; pathology, which embraces the pheno- mena of the second. The history of phenomena, m which vital powers have their ,natural type, conducts us by a natural consequence to those phe- nomena, in which the same powers are changed. Now, in physical sciences we only find the first history, and never the second. Physiology is to the motions of living bodies what astronomy.

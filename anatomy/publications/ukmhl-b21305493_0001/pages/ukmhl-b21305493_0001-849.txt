SECTION II. Organization. The colour of these glands, reddish in the in- fant, greyish in the adult, assumes in the aged subject that yellowish tint, that diminution and laxity, which at that stage characterizes nearly every organ. The colour also varies according to the different regions. Thus the bronchial glands have a blackish colour, partly allied to their structure, but probably owing also to the fluids they contain, which is proved by the inspection of that fluid when pressed from the divided gland. It does not proceed from the vicinity of the

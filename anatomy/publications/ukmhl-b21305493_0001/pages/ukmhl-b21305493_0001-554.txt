VASCULAR SYSTEM 412 vitality. Besides, the motion of which the lungs have become the seat, the dilatation, and more particularly the new excitement from the contact of atmospheric air, by stimulating the capillary circulation, facilitates also that of the two pulmo- nary trunks, and induces the blood to take this course in preference to that through the arterial duct. It is in this respect, I have stated, that the lungs attract the blood from the pulmonary artery. Does it not happen, that the irritation seated in peculiar tumours attracts this fluid in greater quantity ? Is it not from this that the arteries of these tumours dilate, increasing two or even three-fold in diameter? Now what is gra- dually brought on in such cases, is instantly pro- duced in respect to the blood that circulates till birth through the arterial canal, although in a trifling degree, as I have before stated, from its progressive contraction. The very same reason that compels the whole mass of blood of the pulmonary artery to flow through lungs, causes the foramen ovale to close. In fact, this foramen is disposed at birth in such a manner, that the valves have even so far approached as to cross each other, so that, whenever they are pressed together, the communication between the auricles is actually closed. Now the red blood entering the left auricle through the pulmonary veins, presses the valve of the foramen ovale cor- responding to it, against the otter, and conse-

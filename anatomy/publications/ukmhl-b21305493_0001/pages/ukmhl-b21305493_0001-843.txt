701 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. transparent, it is moistened in the dead body by an unctuous fluid that is not, I believe, found during life, in the same manner as that of the arteries is in respect to these vessels. It adheres to the external membrane by a tight cellular tissue, which, as in the veins, very seldom becomes ossified. Mascagni, however, quotes an instance of it, relating to the absorbents of the pelvis : but there is another kind of affection analogous to this, and which I have already frequently seen in these vessels. Their cavities are often seen to contain a white matter, similar to plaster, parti- cularly on the external surface of the lungs. In such instances, without any kind of preparation, the absorbents present nearly the same aspect as if they were filled with mercury. The proper membrane forms, by its reflexions, valves similar to those of the veins, but much more numerous ; they are united two by two, and are rarely found single. They leave between them very short spaces, but of very different ex- tent. This explains why the thoracic duct some- times admits of being injected from above down- wards throughout its whole extent, and on other occasions receives the fluid only in a short space, accordingly as the valves are more or less multi- plied in its cavity; this also depends upon the connection that exists between the width and the diameter of the vessel, a connection that varies * by the same causes as those assigned in respect to

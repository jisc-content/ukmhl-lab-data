general considerations. lvii are formed of very different simple tissues, the idea of peculiar life can only be applied to these single tissues and by no means to the organs themselves. Some striking examples will illustrate this very important part of my doctrine. The stomach is composed of serous, organic, muscular, and mucous tissues, and in addition to these com- mon tissues, is furnished with arteries, veins, &e. which we must consider separately. Accord- ingly, if we take a confused and general view of the peculiar life of the stomach, it will be utterly impossible to form a correct and precise idea of it. In fact the mucous surface is so different from the serous, and both so distinct from the muscular, that we could form no clear judgment of them by confounding them in one general consideration. It is the same with the intestines, bladder, and uterus, &c.,â€”if we do not distinguish the fabric of the tissues that form these complicated organs, the term of peculiar life will offer vague and uncertain ideas. This is so unques- tionably true, that we find tissues alternately absent and present in particular organs. Certain parts of the peritoneum, for example, are either included or excluded, in the structure of the visceral organs, according as they are full or empty. Need I speak of the viscera of the thorax ? What has the fleshy substance of the heart in common with the membrane that surrounds it ? What concern has the pleura with the pulmonary structure ?

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 38 cellular layers are more condensed, and the whole cellular system much less abundant. Towards the terminations of the extremities, which are almost entirely tendinous and fibrous in the hand and foot, the cellular tissue still diminishes, and in proportion to motion, is con- siderably reduced. The foot, nevertheless, par- ticularly at the sole, is provided with a greater quantity than the palm of the hand, where hardly any is to be found. This gradual decrease of the cellular tissue in the extremities, is appropriated to the uses of their various parts. In fact, the extensive motions that are performed in tKe upper part of the body required considerable laxity in the muscles, which they derive from the cellular tissue that sur- rounds them. Lower down the multifarious, and at the same time limited motions, of the hand and foot, particularly the hand, which is formed to mould itself to external bodies, require the nicest and closest apposition in the organs of these two parts, which they owe to the scarcity of their cellular tissue.

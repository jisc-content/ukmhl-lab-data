496 VASCULAK SYSTEM varices are as rare in veins situate between the musclps, as they are frequent in the sub-cutaneous veins, Ac. 2dly. The pulsation of the arteries, which in many parts are joined to the veins, and communicate to these vessels a kind of motion. 3dly. The motion of different parts, as that of the brain, whose mass, incessantly elevated and depressed, accelerates the circulation of the blood of the sinuses in an evident manner, as well as the continual locomotion of the gastric viscera, in respect to the veins contained in the abdomen, that of the pectoral organs in regard to those of the chest, Ac. It is so very certain, that the cir- culation in the veins is aided by external motions, that if a limb has been confined for some space of time by the dressings for fracture, the vessels are frequently found in a dilated state. 4thly. Ex- ternal frictions, if not sufficiently extended to obstruct the veinous circulation, evidently pro- mote it; this is partly the advantage derived from dry frictions. 5thly. A compression that is not irregular or too powerful, also promotes the veinous circulation, when the external organs are weak. Since the time of Thedan and Desault, we have become familiar with the advantages derived from tight bandages in cases of varicous ulcers, of varices, Ac. , Since the principle of motion in the veinous circulation is extended throughout the whole general capillary system, instead of being con-

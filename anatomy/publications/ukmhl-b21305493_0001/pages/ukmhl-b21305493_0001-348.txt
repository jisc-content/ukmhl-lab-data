206 NERVOUS SYSTEM sometimes increased in distant parts, produ- cing those head-aches, those pains in the inte- rior organs, and which only subside when the exciting causes have disappeared ; that on other occasions the animal contractility is increased, from which proceed the convulsions in muscles that do not receive branches from the affected one. In other instances, it is the sensible or- ganic contractility that is observed to be sympa- thetically excited by nervous affections. Thus, in the access of pain in nevralgies, there are often spasmodic vomitings, and the action of the heart is accelerated, &c. The same phenomena may be produced by experiments. Thus, in acting either upon the superior or inferior extremities, by irri- tating them in any manner whatever, after they have been laid bare, I have frequently occasioned vomiting, or brought on convulsive motions in muscles totally unconnected with the nerves that were irritated. In the second place, nerves may be influenced by diseased organs. Thus it happens, that in a num- ber of affections, either acute or chronic, sympa- thetic pains spread themselves through the course of different nerves, particularly in the limbs. As animal sensibility is the predominant property of nerves, it is this which in almost every instance is produced by sympathy. Physicians have not distinguished with sufficient precision, the pains

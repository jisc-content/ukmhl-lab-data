XVill GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS# the bladder and intestines, &c. My only object is to demonstrate that, in the action of substances applied to the body for its cure, as in the pheno- mena of disease, every thing has a reference to vital properties, and that their increase, diminution, or alteration constitutes ultimately the invariable object of our curative means* Some authors recognise nothing in diseases but strength and weakness, and in medicines conse- quently nothing but debilitants and tonics. This idea is in part true, but false if too much gene- ralised. Each vital power has means calculated to excite it when its energy is diminished, and to re- duce it when too much increased. Tonics and debilitants are certainly inapplicable to all cases* We cannot reduce animal contractility when aug- mented in convulsion as we reduce organic in- sensible contractility, when augmented in inflam- mation ; neither can we increase them by the same means. In a similar manner the morbid changes that organic contractility and animal sensibility undergo are not to be obviated by the like means. Every vital power has certain medicines peculiar to itself. Besides, properties are not only altered in degree but they are also vitiated in kind. The various modifications which insensible contractility and organic sen- sibility experience produce different kinds of sup- puration in wounds, ulcers, different secretions in glands, and different fluids from exhaling surfaces.

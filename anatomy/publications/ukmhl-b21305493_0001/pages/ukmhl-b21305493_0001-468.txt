VASCULAR SYSTEM 326 pends upon the scarcity of fluid contained between its laminae, a circumstance that seems itself to pro- ceed from the total absence of cellular texture. The kind of dryness ascertained on opening the arterial laminae is remarkably striking when compared to the moisture in which the muscular fibres are imbedded. When exposed to the action of air, in a moist state, and with other organs, arteries putrefy with difficulty. Their texture seems in this respect to claim some analogy with that of cartilage, of the fibro-cartilage, &c.; for a considerable space of time, like these, it is almost incorruptible ; when undergoing this process alone, the odour it ex- hales is much less offensive than that of the other textures. Ammonia is given out in smaller quantity. The absence of smell is also very striking in the water, in which arteries perfectly divested of any contiguous texture have under- gone maceration. By comparing this water with that in which muscles have been macerated,the dif- ference is striking. An evident proof of the resist- ance arteries oppose to putrefaction and mace- ration, is, what may be observed in the viscera that have macerated for a length of time, or un- dergone dissolution, as the liver, the spleen, fhe loins, &c. In either of these cases, particularly in the first, these organs are reduced to a state of putrescence; but in the general dissolution, their arteries have preserved their texture, which is

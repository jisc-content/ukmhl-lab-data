CELLULAR SYSTEM. 22 are not divided from the others by the serous membranes, as the thoracic and abdominal viscera for the most part are, are every where bounded by a cellular tissue of some thickness. section ir. Of the Cellular System lining the Organs. After having given a covering to the organs, the cellular tissue enters every where into their intimate structure, and forms one of their prin- cipal elements. In those viscera which are com- posed of several parts, these parts are united together by it: thus, in the stomach, intestines, bladder, &c., the different layers of which it is composed separate the serous, muscular, and mucous membranes of the several hollow organs. It sends a multitude of processes into the struc- ture of the lungs, between the serous membrane and their parenchyma, between this and the bronchia, between the bronchia and mucous surface. In the large organs, the cellular tissue first attends and surrounds throughout their whole course, the vascular and nervous ramifications which are found in their composition; and afterwards unites the different homogenous parts that compose each.

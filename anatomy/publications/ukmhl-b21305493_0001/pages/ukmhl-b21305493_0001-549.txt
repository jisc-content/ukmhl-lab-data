Thus, in the upper parts of the body the cerebral arteries are much larger than those which resort to the face : amongst the latter, the ophthalmic is greater than the nasal, the palatine, &c. In the chest, those of the thymus gland are proportionally larger than at a subsequent period. ^ In the abdomen, from the state of the gastric viscera, there are very conside- rable arteries. In the pelvis, on the contrary, the arterial system is very limited, because the viscera are small, and their nutrition is almost overlooked. The arteries are proportionally more diminutive in the upper than in the lower extre- mities, particularly so in the early periods; for towards that of birth the proportion is nearly the same. The arterial texture is incomparably more elastic in the foetus than in the adult; it is more readily extended ; and they are not so easily divided by the application of the ligature. Aneu- risms are scarcely ever met with in the infant. In the foetus, a number of minute arteries ra- mify in all directions in the parieties of the large ones, which are frequently, we may say almost livid, with them. To observe them accurately, it is necessary that they should be examined at this age. Does this abundance of vessels dispose the arteries at this time to inflammation, which is

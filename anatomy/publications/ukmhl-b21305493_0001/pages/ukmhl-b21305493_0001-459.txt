OF THE KED BLOOD. 317 of the cranium very often become red in the corpse, by remaining in the fluids that moisten these parts; on opening the scull we perceive this redness, which does not proceed from stag- nated blood in the arterial cavities, as may be easily ascertained. The thickness of the membrane, peculiar to arteries, is very obvious in large trunks. It then gradually decreases, a circumstance that essen- tially distinguishes it from the internal membrane, which I have found nearly as thick in the tibial ar- tery as in the aorta. It has been thought, that in se- veral arteries, as the cerebral, the fibrous tunic was wanting. It cannot be doubted, that on the verte- bral and internal carotid, it is proportionally much thinner than on trunks of an equal size, situate in the muscular interstices ; but, on examining these arteries attentively, I have evidently distinguished circular fibres: whether the slightness of their parieties promote those fatal effusions so fre- quently ascertained in the brain, I cannot tell. Such effusions only take place in the capillaries, never in the trunks; but it is impossible to ex- amine these capillary vessels. I have attempted, without succeeding, to find out by injections, those lacerated by apoplexy ; however, this he- morrhage does not resemble that of the serous mem- branes : it is not a transudation through the exha- lants ol the ventricles; for these cavities are but very seldom their only seat: these effusions al-

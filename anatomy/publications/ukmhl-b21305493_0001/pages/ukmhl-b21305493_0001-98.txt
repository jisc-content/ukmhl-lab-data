I might apply the same remark to the brain and its mem- branes, as well as to the ear; eye, and other organs. When we study a function, we must consider the complicated organ which performs it in a general way ; but if we would be instructed in the properties and life of that organ, we must abso- lutely resolve it into its constituent parts. So, too, if we are satisfied with general ideas in anatomy, we must examine every organ en masse, but it is imperiously necessary to separate their tissues one by one, if we purpose to go into a minute analysis of their intimate structure. SECTION VII. Consequences of the preceding Principles in respect to Diseases. What I have premised, leads us to very im- portant consequences, relative to acute and chro- nic diseases of a local kind ; for those which, like most of the fevers, do invade all parts of the system at once, cannot be much illustrated by the anatomy of systems. The first deserves our especial notice. Since diseases are nothing else but alterations of vital properties, and tissues differ so widely in

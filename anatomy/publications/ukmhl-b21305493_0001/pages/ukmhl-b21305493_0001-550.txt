Vascular system 408 so rare at the later periods of life ? I have not observed that it is the case. In the early period of conception, the arterial layers and fibres are not very distinct in the foetus: * one might say, the substance of the artery is homogeneous. It is, however, much firmer than the adjoining textures, and corresponds to that of the heart. Intended to distribute to the nutritive substance to every part, arWies must unavoid- ably precede every other organ, in respect to nutrition. This premature increase, which is constantly concomitant with that of the heart, would alone be sufficient to prove that arteries develope themselves, and are not perforated in our internal parts, as Haller asserted, by the impulse of the heart. Besides, this manner of admitting of their mechanical formation, is evi- dently contrary to the known laws of the animal economy. section ir. i State of the Vascular System of the Tied Blood during Growth. At the instant of birth, two important revolu- tions take place in the system of the red blood ; 1st. A mechanical action, as it were, with respect to its circulation ; 2dly. A chemical action in the na- ture of this fluid. The former consists in the

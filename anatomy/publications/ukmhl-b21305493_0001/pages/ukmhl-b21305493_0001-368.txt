NERVOUS SYSTEM 226 the immediate connection of the first with growth and nutrition ; on the other, how slightly these are influenced by the second. The nerves, as well as the brain, are principally inactive before birth, although they present considerable deve- lopement. To this must be attributed the con- stant absence of all affections at that period. They exist invariably in the foetus, whilst the latter organ, and even the spinal marrow,are some- times wanting, which constitutes the acephali. I shall afterwards explain how the foetus can exist in this state, and at present I shall merely re- mark, that the heart, the liver, and the other es- sential viscera of organic life, on the contrary, are rarely deficient in the foetus. Why ? Because all the organs of that life are necessary for the purposes of growth and nourishment, and be- cause these phenomena may very easily take place without the influence of the brain, this being principally intended to preside over animal life, which is not especially required to fulfil its office until the period of birth. SECTION II. State of the Nervous System during Growth. At birth, the nervous system of animal life un- dergoes a remarkable revolution, in consequence of the blood by which it is penetrated ; until that

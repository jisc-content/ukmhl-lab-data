VA3CULAK SYSTEM 380 arteries were empty at the moment of the con- traction ; but when filled, the shock is gene- rally and suddenly felt with nearly the same degree of energy, as well at the extremities of arteries as at their origin. It is only in the ra- mifications that the motion is rather reduced. Let the arteries of a corpse be filled with water, and a charged syringe be adapted to the aorta, at the moment the piston is compressed the fluid will project from the aorta, or from any other artery, if an aperture that has previously been made be unclosed. The idea generally entertained of the pro- gressive motion of the blood is then perfectly in- correct. This fluid has been conceived to flow in the arteries nearly in the same manner as water runs in a stream ; but this is not the case. At each contraction of the ventricle it suddenly experiences a general motion, that is felt in the extreme parts. Shall we make use of another simile ? Let us again suppose a syringe, to which a continuation of elastic tubes arising from each other are adapt- ed ; at the very moment the impulse is given, these tubes are seen to fill simultaneously, to straighten and give exit to the fluid, if their ex- tremities have been left open. It is not by the contraction of the arteries that the blood is forced to their extremities. This is so correct, that if one of these vessels be opened at a distant part from the heart, every jerk of the

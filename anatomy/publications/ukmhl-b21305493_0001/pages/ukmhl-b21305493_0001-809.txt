I have noticed that the tunica vagina- lis, and the tunica arachnoi'dea, are much less liable to these infiltrations than any other analogous membrane ; I never met with any in the latter, and only with two instances in the former. I do not, of course, allude to those hemorrhages, the effect of wounds in the head, and where there is effusion of blood between the duplicatures of the tunica arachnoi'dea. I have carefully examined the internal surface of the peritoneum, the pleura, and the pericar- dium, subsequent to these kinds of hemorrhages, produced in consequence of inflammation or of organic disease: their surfaces have appeared to me perfectly sound, so that it is evident that the blood was effused by the exhalants in the place of the serum previously emitted. I compare a serous surface, accidentally pour- ing out blood after inflammation, to the active hemorrhages of the mucous surfaces. On the other hand, when the serous exhalants, in the decline of organic diseases of the heart, of the 0 Â» womb, of the lungs, &c., pour out blood; when, in these instances, blood received from the mucous exhalants is expectored or expelled by vomiting, by the stools, &c., they are certainly the same phenomena. Are there cases during life, in which the blood 3 d 2

OF TIIE RED BLOOD. 297 preserves, by its formation, the whole sum of motion communicated to the blood by the heart; a circumstance, however, that, in consequence of the difference of the distance, does not, as I have already stated, prevent the impetus from being more sensibly felt by the superior than by the inferior organs. At the upper part of the pelvis, the aorta divides into two secondary trunks, whose subdivisions acquire the name of branches, and are multiplied in ramifications of various sizes. Mathematical anatomists have exaggerated the number of the arterial subdivisions. Several have attributed a hundred to a single artery. Haller reduced them to twenty, and still less. To ascertain this correctly, we must take the arteries at their origin, and follow their course under the mucous membraneâ€”the peritoneum, for example, where they are very apparent through- out, and the subdivisions do not, as I have often convinced myself, exceed the amount stated by Haller. The inspection of a living animal, whose abdomen has been laid open, is almost the only method that can be employed with certainty for this purpose. If injections are too coarse, they do not fill all the ramifications ; if too fine, they penetrate the exhalants, and impart to the whole serous surface an unnatural colour. It is scarcely possible to ascertain, by injections, the precise point of the natural circulation. To be convinced VOL. II. D D

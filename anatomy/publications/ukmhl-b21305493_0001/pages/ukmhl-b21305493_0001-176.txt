Under the pectoral muscles a great quantity is also found, which gradually decreases as it descends. Abdominal Cellular Tissue. The abdomen is in proportion supplied with somewhat more of this tissue than the thorax. Within its cavity, this tissue is accumulated in those parts where the large trunks of the ar- teries and veins enter into the different viscera, in the cleft of the liver, the mesentery, &c.

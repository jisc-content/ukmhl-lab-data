Some organs are covered with a net- work of capillaries scarcely to be enumerated here. In others this network is hardly perceptible. As to the parts proper, or those which essentially dis- tinguish animal tissue, differences are striking:â€” colour, thickness, hardness,density, resistance,&c.: nothing is alike single. A glance suffices to shew a thousand attributes characteristic of each, and ex- clusive of others. Here we meet with a fibrous arrangement, there with a granulated one; again, we have a laminated one and in many instances the areolar, &c. Notwithstanding these distinctions, authors do not agree in respect to the limits of the different tissues. I have, consequently, had recourse to the action of certain chemical re- agents to determine this point. I have examined every tissue under the influence of caloric, air, water, acids, alkalies, neutral salts, &c. Desicca- tion, putrefaction, maceration, concretion, &c., the results of these agents, have variously affected their different textures. Accordingly it will be seen, that in scarcely one case have they been similar; that in these various alterations, each has been affected in its own peculiar way, and furnished its own phenomena. It has been long a subject of keen enquiry and dispute, whether the arteries have muscular fibres or not, or

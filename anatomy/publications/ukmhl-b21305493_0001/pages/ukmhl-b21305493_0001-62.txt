XXII GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS, dynamics, hydraulics, hydrostatics, &c. are to inert bodies; consequently, the latter have no sciences corresponding to them, as pathology corresponds to the first. By the same reason, all idea of artificial cure is at variance with the sciences of natural philosophy. A remedy is intended to restore properties to their natural order ; physical properties never deviating from that order, do not of necessity require to be restored to it. There is nothing in physics analogous to therapeutics in physiology. We perceive, then, in what way the peculiar inconstancy of vital properties pro- duces that immense series of phenomena which demand a particular class of sciences. What would become of the world if physical laws were subject to the same changes and agitations as the vital laws ? Much has been said of the revolutions of the globe, the changes that the earth has under- gone, the desolation which ages have gradually wrought in it, on it, and around it, and of which centuries and centuries have rolled away since without affording another instance. What, then ; we should witness this rude spectacle of nature in havoc and confusion at every instant, if phy- sical properties bore the same character as the vital ones. As the phenomena and laws are so different in physical and physiological sciences, these sciences must themselves essentially differ from each other. The manner of representing facts, and searching

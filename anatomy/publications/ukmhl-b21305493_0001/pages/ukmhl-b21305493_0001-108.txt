lxviii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. on the nature of the part affected. 2ndly. Those that proceed from the disordered state of its functions. For instance, the character of the pain, the nature of the attendant fever, its dura- tion, termination, &c. are most commonly the same to whatever organ the diseased mem- brane may belong. If it be the pleura, there is greater oppression in breathing, the cough is dry, &c.; if the peritoneum, there is diarrhoea, or constipation, vomiting, &c.; if it be the tunica arachnoides, derangement of the intellectual functions; if the pericardium there is irregular pulse, &c. The first symptoms belong to every class of disease, the second are exclusively confined to a certain number. The latter therefore are in some measure accidental, and depend on the neigh- bourhood of the diseased tissue with the adjacent parts; the former possess the greatest impor- tance. Medicine as yet, has made but a very limited and indefinite progress in its researches on inflam- mations of divers tissues. Those of the cellular, mucous, serous, and cutaneous, or skin, are suffi- ciently known, but the others are more obscure. It is undetermined which is attacked in rheuma- tism, whether tendinous or muscular. I am dis- posed to believe it is the former. With respect to inflammatory phenomena in cartilages, veins, arte- ries, and the synovial membrane, &c. scarcely any thing is understood.

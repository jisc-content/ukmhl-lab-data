CELLULAR SYSTEM. 75 the same ratio to a variety of morbid changes, wherein its tissue, distended with the different substances that are exhaled, is sometimes con- verted into a solid and compact mass, sometimes into an unctuous and adipose substance; at others it is softened into jelly or condensed into the form and aspect of scirrhus, &c. Absorbents. The absorbent vessels correspond to the ex- halants in the cellular system; they are imper- ceptible to the eye, and unattainable by injec- tions. We can, notwithstanding, prove their ex- istence ; 1st. By the natural and permanent ab- sorption of fat and serum; 2dly. By the still more striking process by which depositions of fluid are removed from the system in dropsy, of blood in ecchymosis, and in various kinds of ab- sorption ; 3dly. The disappearance of mild fluids injected into the cellular tissue, which can only be effected by the agency of these vessels ; 4thly. The re-solution of emphysema, natural or accidental, where air, or at least its constituent principles, has no other means for its escape. This is made manifest in the particular instance where emphysema is produced by the rupture of an air-cell in the lungs, or in that, equally in point, where openings that have been made in the sub- cutaneous tissue of an animal for the purpose of n 2

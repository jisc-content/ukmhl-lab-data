OF TIIE RED BLOOD. 417 circulation of the pulmonary artery through the arterial canal. 4th. Of the blood of the aorta descendens, in the umbilical artery. These four circumstances, I say, particularly the three last, seem to proceed from a cause with which we are not yet well acquainted. The change that takes place in the connection between organic sensibility, and the nature of the blood, might be only accessory; since, as I have already stated, it is not so much this property, as it is the action of the heart itself, that performs circulation in the trunks. This subject claims, in a particular man- ner, the attention of physiologists. When once respiration is fully established, the lungs are found in a state of opposition to the ' whole body; they distribute the blood to all parts of the body, and from these this fluid is returned. Then there is a very obvious dis- tinction between the two systems of the red and of the dark blood, and things are carried on as we have before stated. Subsequent to birth, the vascular system of the red blood, on account of its greater developement and its more numerous ramifications, still predo- minates for a considerable time. In fact, the number of vessels penetrated by red blood, is greater at this epoch than afterwards. It is only necessary to dissect the bodies of different animals, to be convinced that the system in question con- tains, in the early periods of life, a much greater

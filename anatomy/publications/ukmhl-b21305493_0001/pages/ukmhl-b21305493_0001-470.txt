VASCULAR SYSTEM 328 action of water is combined with that of caloric, which takes place in boiling, the following is the result: 1st. Very little scum rises before ebulli- tion from the vessel; one might be led to be- lieve, that in this respect the arterial texture and the muscular display two opposite pheno- mena in the economy ; the small quantity of scum produced by the first is greyish : 2dly. At the time of ebullition, an evident shrinking takes place, less, however, than that of the nervous texture, but more characteristic in the diameter than in the axis. This is accompanied by a propor- tionate induration, and the water assumes a yel- lowish hue ; 3dly. Permanency of this state for half an hour and longer, ebullition still continued ; 4thly. Gradual softening; but at the same time a greyish hue succeeds to the yellowish ; a defi- ciency of adherence in the fibres gradually en- creasing as ebullition is carried on, and causing them to lacerate with the utmost facility; 5thly. For whatever length of time ebullition be conti- nued, the arterial texture is never reduced to a gelatinous yellowish pulp, like that of the fibres, cartilages, &c. The fibres remain as they were, similarly connected, and of the same volume, &c. The deficiency of adherence and change of hue are almost the only phenomena they display; 6thly. The solution produced by boiling is in- sipid, and even flat: a proof that the arterial tex- ture hardly contains any neutral salts.

101 CELLULAR SYSTEM. first much expanded, lessen gradually in bulk; they collapse by means of their contractility of tissue, adhere together, and the following are the phenomena that result from their union. 1st. The granulations disappear and are re-implaced by a uniform surface ; 2dly, that surface is a thin mem- brane, because the size of the granulations depends not on the cells, but on the substance they con- tained, which is absorbed ; 3dly, this membrane is shrunk, and infinitely of smaller diameter than the original membrane which covered the granu- lations, because the cells as they contracted draw the edges of the divided parts from the circum- ference to the centre, which are thus shortened, and the size of the wound materially lessened ; the same granulations which at first occupied a space of six inches in diameter, as in the opera- tion for cancer, are reduced to little more than an inch and a half. When adhesion is completed between all the cells that originally formed granulations, the membrane of the cicatrix exists that results from such adhesion : thus these fleshy substances, whose developement surprised us, and which appeared amply to repair the loss of substance, are reduced to nothing more than a mere pellicle, of a reddish hue, as long as the exhalants are filled with blood, and afterwards white, owing to the return of this fluid to its natural channels. From this mode of origin that is observable in

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XOVii h 2 of the first, emaciation and debility are infallible \ consequences. / Such is in substance the manner in which the general theory of nutrition can only be under- stood, a theory which I shall unfold at greater length in my physiology, and on which I shall dwell a few moments longer, to demonstrate that it is a system not gratuitously imagined, but that it absolutely rests upon the laws of the animal eco- nomy, and its organic phenomena. Accordingly, I think that this assertion will be fully demonstrated, if I prove, 1st. The uniformity of the parenchyma of nutrition; 2dly. The variety of nutritive sub- stances ; 3dly. The faculty that the nutritive parenchyma enjoys of appropriating to itself, ac- cording to its degree of organic sensibility, such and such nutritive substances exclusively of others, and subsequently rejecting that substance, and assimilating another. Such are, in fact, the fundamental principles of this theory. I assert in the first place, that the parenchyma of nutrition is the same in all organs, and that it is an assemblage of red vessels, exhalants, absorbents, cellular membrane and nerves. These are the proofs; 1st. These different species of organs are united in every other part, as I have already stated ; anatomy detects them everywhere, be- tween every fibre, every layer, and in every point as it were, they are indeed common organs.

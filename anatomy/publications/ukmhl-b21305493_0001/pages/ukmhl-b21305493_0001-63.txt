xxin general considerations. after their causes, the experimental art, &c., every thing, in a word, must wear a different stamp, and it would be preposterous to confound them to- gether. As physical sciences rose to perfection before the physiological ones, some have thought to illustrate the latter by associating them to- gether, and have egregiously perplexed them : This was inevitable ; for, to apply the science of natural philosophy to physiology would be to1 ex- plain the phenomenaof living bodies by the laws of inert bodies. Here, then, is a false principle; and, therefore, all consequences deduced from thence are illegitimate. Let us leave to chemistry its attractions, and to physics their elasticity and gravity. In physiology we must confine ourselves to sensibility and contractility. Some exception must be allowed, nevertheless, for certain cases where the same organ is the seat of vital and phy- sical phenomena, as the ear and eye. In this respect my work differs in its general tenor from those of physiology, and even from that of the ce- lebrated Haller. The works of Stahl have power- fully inculcated the inestimable advantage of lay- ing aside all these pretended collateral aids, which overwhelm the science they profess to support. This eminent physician, however, had not analyzed the vital properties, and, therefore, was inadequate to explain the phenomena in their real aspect. No- thing is more vague and unsatisfactory than these words, vitality, vital action, vital influx, &c. when

NERVOUS SYSTEM 274 . that the acute pains which generally attend the formation of aneurisms are partly owing to the dis- tention of the nervous filaments that accompany the artery. I have already said it is highly pro- bable that the organic nerves are materially con- cerned in the different sensations we experience from certain nervous affections. In some cases these nerves give place to evident sympathies, and to this must be attributed the various injuries that Petit de Namur has produced in the organ of sight, by irritating such of its branches as are accessible to our experiments. The developement of the nerves of ganglions follow pretty nearly the same laws as those governing the organs from which they proceed. Let us remark, in concluding this system, that there is not one in the economy more deserving of particular attention on the part of the physi- ologist; all the others present a series of pheno- mena with which we are already perfectly familiar; in this, we have hardly perceived any thing. Hitherto, it has only presented attributes that are at variance with those found in the nervous system of animal life. Thus, it cannot be doubted, that in animal sensibility the nerves of organic life do not take such an active part as the pre- ceding ; that they are always strangers to the same kind of contractility; that they do not in a direct manner influence sensible, organic contract

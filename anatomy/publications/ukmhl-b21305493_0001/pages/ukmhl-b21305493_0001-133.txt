xcm general considerations. of frequency, and pervade almost all parts. It is not uncommon to find no distinct nerves in those parts where they penetrate, as in the fasciae, fibrous membranes, &c. &c. Lastly, The nervous system is, of all the generative systems, one which the knife of the anatomist detects in the smallest number of organised parts. The serous membranes, the whole fibrous system, cartilaginous, fibro- cartilaginous, and bony systems, are entirely des- titute of it. Being especially intended to form part of the structure of other organs, the generating systems likewise fulfil this office to the advantage of one another: thus, the cellular substance enters into the composition of the nerves, arteries and veins ; the arteries and veins on the other hand are seen ramified minutely on the cellular membrane, &c. It is a general intertexture, in which each part gives and receives. It must be manifest, from what I have stated, that the generative systems, considered in respect to the texture of organs, forming a regular and common basis to all, must precede others in their developement; this is indeed what observation proves to us in a clear and satisfactory manner: whilst the greatest number have scarcely begun to exist in the first months of infancy, these are singularly predominant. The nerves and their centre, which is the brain, the arteries, veins, and

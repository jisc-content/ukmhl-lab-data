503 OF THE DARK BLOOD. quently, seem to be as fully organized; their parieties are very resistant, and even not so easily dilated, a quality that continues throughout youth. To this, I attribute the absence of varices at that age. In fact, as less blood is circulated through the veins, and they seem proportionally more re- sistant, it is evident they will be less disposed to yield. SECTION IT. Slate of this System during Growth, and sub- sequently. At birth, as we have seen, a remarkable revo- lution takes place in the system of the veinous circulation; the right auricle and ventricle receive the whole of the blood, a part of which, till then, was passed directly to the left auricle through the foramen ovale. This difference does not ma- terially influence the capacity of the right auricle and ventricle; their forms, only, undergo some change, which I shall explain minutely, in the descriptive anatomy. During the first years, the size of the veins is still inferior to that of the arteries. This infe- riority is even continued during the whole time of growth: it may be ascertained by examining the external veins, they are as marked and per-

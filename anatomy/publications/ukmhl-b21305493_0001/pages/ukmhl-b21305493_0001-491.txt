349 OK THE RLD BLOOD. performed by the deficiency of extension in the arterial coat?, that is to say, because these vessels contain no longer the blood that prevents their contracting, or because they have been cut, and afterwards left to themselves. Elasticity on the contrary, in order to act, requires a preliminary compression, and manifests itself by an abrupt return of the parts to their natural state. 2dly. The contractility of the texture is in permanent readiness for contraction ; it might he said that all the parts possessed of this property are in a forced state, so that whenever this ceases to ex- ist, contraction instantly follows. Elasticity, on the contrary, is not found in that permanent readiness to be produced. 3dly. All elastic mo- tions are abrupt and sudden, ceasing as quickly as they are produced. On the contrary, all the movements of contraction in the texture are in- sensibly and gradually brought on, frequently re- quiring several hours, nay, several days, to be produced, as may be seen in the contraction of amputated muscles, &c. 4thly. Every organ whose texture is capable of contraction, necessa- rily possesses extensibility : this last property, on the contrary, is not necessarily associated with elasticity, as may be observed in coarse bodies, in the cartilages of animals, &c. 5thly. Elasti- city is a property solely physical, the contractility of the texture, without being vital, is proper to the organs of the animal creation only.

649 EXHALANT SYSTEM. To those distinctions must undoubtedly be re- ferred those met with in injections, if rather fluid, they flow from the mucous, serous, even from the cellular exhalants; but in those intended to transmit synovia, they pass with much greater difficulty. It is the same in the capillary system ; whilst in this system injections pass with the greatest facility over the serous surfaces, that may be rendered livid ; the synovial surfaces are not quite so readily permeated.

The vessels of the exhalant system are too mi- nute to admit of analyzing the powers of the tis- sue. Do they become larger on being penetrated with the red particles ? I really do not know. Haller, who admitted the existence of exhalants, had thought the white fluids only were admitted through their tubes, because their diameter was not in proportion with the red particles. This opinion also prevailed in the Boerhaavian school. vol. i. 3 c

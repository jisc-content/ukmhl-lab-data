282 VASCULAR SYSTEM the red blood, and the termination of that of the black. The general capillary system affords a ter- mination to the red blood, and an origin to the black. Let us observe, that this again, is an essential cha- racteristic that distinguishes the two circulations. In fact, the blood not only takes a course opposite to the part where it terminates, and where it be- gins, but the nature of the fluid is moreover per- fectly changed, and in this respect, the two ca Pii- lary systems, the pulmonary, and the general one, individually display one of the most important phenomena in the living economy; namely, in the first, the change of black blood into red; in the second, that of red into black. The general question respecting each of these circulations, evidently offers three things to our examination : 1st. The origin. 2dly. The course. 3dly. The termination of the two species of blood. In the origin and termination, we shall find, on one hand, the mechanical phenomena of circulation; on the other, the phenomena of the changes in the blood. In the passage of this fluid, we have only to observe the mechanical phenomena of circulation. Mechanical Phenomena of the two Circulations. In examining these phenomena in a general manner, it is perceived, 1st. That the red blood flowing from the lungs, proceeds in columns, so

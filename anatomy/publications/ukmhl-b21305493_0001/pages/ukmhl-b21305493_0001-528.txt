386 VASCULAR SYSTEM in the ordinary state; however, if the artery be gently compressed, the blood is exerted to dilate it, and that exertion encreases the sensation of the pulse. Jadelot had even gone so far as to admit that this alone constituted pulsation. On the other hand, if, at the contraction of the heart, a considerable quantity of blood be received in the arterial system ; if some resistance be met with in the general capillary systems, arteries may also be dilated ; but then, it is not their contraction that propels the blood into the capillaries; such return is only consecutive. In fact, at the very moment of contraction, on one part, the blood, in proceeding from the ventricle, enters the arteries, and on the other part, projects from these into the capillary vessels: these two phenomena take place at the same instant, since they are produced by the very same impulse ;â€”hence, whenever contrac- tion exists in the'artery, a movement derived only from the contractility of the texture, this con- traction does not propel the blood, but takes place because the fluid has been impelled in the capillary system; at the moment of contraction the artery returns to its former state, because it is no longer extended, and not because it is actually distended. In this way the arterial contraction may alternate with that of the left ventricle; but authors have not understood it in this sense. There are, then, two periods in the movement of the red blood : .v

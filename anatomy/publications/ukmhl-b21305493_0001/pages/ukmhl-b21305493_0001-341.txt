OF ANIMAL LIFE. 199 for this function, are, as I have already men- tioned, nearly deprived of them ; that every time accidental exhalations take place, as in cysts, in hydatids, &c., nerves evidently have no kind of influence, since such tumours do not possess them ; that by acting- in any manner whatever on the nervous system, by irritating the nerves, the brain, or the spinal marrow, to excite this system; that in tying or dividing the first, or in submit- ing the second to compression, to lessen its ac- tion, or to annihilate it, we can never disturb, in any way whatever, the cellular, serous, synovial, or cutaneous exhalations ; finally, that the dis- eases of the nervous system can never have any other influence over this function but that derived from general sympathies. 3dly. The same may be said in respect to ab- sorption, it is during sleep, that the skin often absorbs most readily ; in this case, there really ex- ists a kind of discontinuance of action, as well in the nervous system, as in that of the brain; this intermission, to which it is periodically submitted, ought to produce a similar one in all the serous, synovial, and medullary absorptions, &c.: how- ever, they are still continually carried on. It is the same in respect to all the functions over which organic sensibility presides; they are actually continued, although the nervous and cerebral actions are essentially intermittent. 4thly. The same observation appertains to the

OF THE RED BLOOD. 313 snred the arteries externally after having been injected; in fact, the dimensions of the trunks are more considerable in proportion to their parieties than those of the ramifications sepa- tately examined*; that is to say, cetetis paribus, the coats of the aorta are thinner than those of / the cubital artery. This is undoubtedly the rea- son why aneurism seldom occurs in the branches, and frequently in the trunks, particularly when these affections proceed from a local cause; for when the cause is constitutional, small arteries, especially the radials, are frequently affected, of which I have seen two instances. This observa- tion respecting the proportions of the arterial coats, proves the impossibility of ascertaining correctly their comparative diameter, unless they are examined internally. These affinities are also naturally very change- able, according as the vital forces, which also vary so prodigiously, increase or contract the channel of the small arteries; and in this point of view such examination is undeserving of the importance attached to it by the ancients, whose works are scattered with endless calculations on this subject.

OF THE DARK BLOOD. 505 two opposite stages of life are reversed. It is sufficient to consider the external habit in both ages, by examining the superficial veins, to be convinced of the accuracy of this assertion. Let us be careful, however, not to imply by this greater developement, an addition of sub- stance in the parieties of the veins, such, for in- stance, as the increase of a bone from a super- abundance of calcareous phosphate. It is merely a dilatation of the parieties, that, instead of in- creasing, become even weaker and thinner. This dilatation is owing to the loss of their energy, and to the greater quantity of blood that is returned from the organs. In fact the process of decom- position evidently predominates over that of for- mation in aged subjects. More substance is re- moved from their organs than is added to them. The bones, I believe, are the only parts impreg- nated with a larger quantity of the substance in- tended for their nutrition ; in every other organ the opposite state exists, from whence their con- traction and decay. Now as it is to the veinous system that the residue of the decomposition of our organs is transmitted, it is not surprising that this should be dilated in old age, in the same man- ner as the arterial system conveying the materials for their composition should predominate in early life : the superabundance, however, of the dark blood in old age, is in some degree an illusion ; in fact, it also depends upon the slowness with VOL. i.

OF THE UFD BLOOD. 39T punity in those of the foetus, this only proceeds from the difference in the nature of the two fluids. Besides, it must be remarked, that there is a great difference in the functions of the foetus and those of the adult. The former has scarcely possession of any animal life ; and is deficient in several or- ganic functions. The connections between the organs are of a very different nature from what they will become subsequent to birth. Not even the slightest analogy can be established, in this respect, between the foetus and the infant. Thus have we observed that the experiments upon life and death produce quite different results in animals endowed with red and warm blood, and in those only provided with red and cold blood, which, in some points of view, rather approach the organization of the foetus. No parallel then can be drawn between the foetus and the infant in respect to injury of the phenomena of respira- tion, such as that whose causes I have sought in my experiments, since the organization relating to these phenomena differ so essentially from each other. Although I have stated that the blood of the two capillary systems are united into one circu- lation, yet there exists, particularly in the first periods, a kind of insulation in the general mass of the fluid ; an insulation which Sabatier first noticed accurately ; and which results from the manner in which the apertures of the foramen

298 VASCULAR SYSTEM of this, we have only to inject a dog, to open the abdomen in another of the same size, and we shall always find more or less injected vessels in the one compared with those filled with blood in the other. During the time that I was occupied in demonstrating the insufficiency of either coarse or fine injections, I have frequently made this experiment, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of blood in a given part. Arteries, in dividing, form with each other very different angles. Sometimes they are right angles, as in the middle intercostal; sometimes they are obtuse, which is less frequent, as in the superior intercostal; but most frequently they are acute, particularly in the extremities. The origin of the spermatic artery is the most striking example of the acute angle. It is generally remarked, that whenever there are two divisions, one is larger than the other, and follows, more than its fellow, the direction of the original trunk; on the inside of the artery corresponding to the angles externally, a promi- nence is formed by the internal membrane, which breaks the column of blood, and facilitates its change of direction. The position of this pro-' jection is extremely variable, and depends upon the angle of origin. 1st. If it be a vight angle, the former is disposed ^ i ei'*oT, and distinct in its circumference. 2dly Tf it be an acuta angle, as in the meseu- i

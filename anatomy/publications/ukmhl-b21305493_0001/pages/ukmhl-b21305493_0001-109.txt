lxix GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. An essential distinction is necessary to be ob- served in these researches, and it is this: first. That particular tissues, such as the bony, muscular of animal life, &c. are exactly the same in every organ where they exist, and consequently their diseases can in no wise differ. 2dly. That others, such as the cutaneous, serous, mucous, &c. do undergo, according to their respective organs, certain varieties of structure and vital pro- perties, which must necessarily modify the general phenomena of that particular class of diseases which affect these organs. 3dly, and finally. That others, as the glandular and muscu- lar of organic life, &c. being very different in each organ, have the general symptoms and nature of their diseases therefore essentially different. These assertions will be proved in the course of this work. After having shown that the greater number of local diseases generally affect not one parti- cular organ, but a particular tissue in that organ, it will be necessary to explain the differences they display according to the tissues affected. As I shall have to treat this occasionally at some length, in the consideration of the different organs, I merely make cursory mention of it here. We shall find then that pain is differently mo- dified in each tissue, according to the degree of sensibility it possesses. The pain which is pro- duced from the inflammation of one is unlike that which attends the inflammation of another.

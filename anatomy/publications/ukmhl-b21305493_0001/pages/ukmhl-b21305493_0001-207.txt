65 CELLULAR SYSTEM. Oil the other hand, we find none of these pouches, or, more properly, cells, and none of the plates that form them, in the submucous tissue, or that which constitutes the outer coat of arteries, veins, and excretories. If we remove this mem- brane with care, we shall perceive, on raising* it from the surface beneath and drawing* it out, to bring their texture into view, a multitude of fila- ments crossing each other in different directions, and forming a network, as it were, of meshes, but not pouches or distinct cavities. This net- work is quickly distended with air when it is forced into the neighbouring tissue, but as soon as a puncture is made it escapes and the tissue collapses,â€”whereas that accumulated in the common tissue, subcutaneous or intermuscular, remains in the cells, although they be in part ex- posed with the knife, doubtless because the open- ings of communication between them are very small. We observe frequent instances of this in the markets, where the cells are seen considera- bly expanded round the meat which is divested of the skin. It appears that these filaments, interwoven in every direction with one another, and forming a cellular network round the vessels and under the mucous surfaces, are precisely of the same nature as those scattered here and there about the mem- branous plates of which the cells are formed ; the

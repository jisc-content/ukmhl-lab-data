GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. lii pie bodies, which by the various combinations they admit of, form the compound ones: these are calo- ric, light, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, azote, phos- phorus, &c. Anatomy, in like manner, has its sim- ple tissues, which, by their combinations, form the organs, properly so called. These tissues are 1st. The cellular membrane. 2dly. The nerves of ani- mal life. 3dly. The nerves of organic life. 4thly. The arteries. 5thly. The veins. 6thly. The exha- lants. 7thly. Absorbents and glands. 8thly. The bones. 9thly. The medulla. lOthly. Cartilage. 11th. Muscular fibre. 12th. Fibro-cartilagin- ous tissue. 13th. Muscles of organic life. 14th. Those of animal life. 15th. The mucous mem- brane. 16th. The serous. 17. The synovial. 18th. The Glands. 19th. The dermis. 20th. The epidermis. 21st. The cutis. Such are the real organized elements of our frame. Whatever be the nat ure of those parts which are blended together, theirs remain uniformly the same; as in chemistry, simple substances do not vary, however the compounds they unite to may differ. We shall make these organized elements of man, the especial objects of this work. The plan of thus separately examining the single tissues of our component parts, is by no means a gratuitous assumption; it rests on undeniable grounds, and I trust it will exercise a wide and powerful influence over physiology

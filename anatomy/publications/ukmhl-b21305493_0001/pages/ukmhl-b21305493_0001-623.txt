481 OF THE DARK BLOOD. unfrequently the case, and even that it often coincides with that in which the dura-mater, being loosened from the cranium, is separated from it by an effusion. Are the extremities of the veins suddenly burst in apoplexy ? I have already mentioned, that, in this respect, we are still in the dark. All such cases of lace- ration are perfectly distinct from those in which the artery is affected with aneurism; they fre- quently occur ; the dilatation being infinitely less than in numerous instances, in which they con- tinue whole, most commonly they do not take place. The whole of the vein, including the cellular covering, gives way, &c. In true aneu- risms, on the contrary, the artery is always ruptured, and whenever dilatation has reached a certain degree, it cannot fail. The two arterial coatings are easily lacerated; the cellular coat remains perfect. There is not, I believe, a single case of aneurismal tumour of a tolerable size â€¢> but is attended with laceration. Why is this? Because the extensibility of arteries can only take place to a certain degree. Laceration, then, pro- ceeds from a deficiency of this property. On the contrary, it cannot be attributed to this cause in the veins. We are not yet well acquainted with their causes. In numerous cases the veinous i tissue is certainly affected ; this is undoubtedly the case in hemorrhoides, &c. Let us, then, be

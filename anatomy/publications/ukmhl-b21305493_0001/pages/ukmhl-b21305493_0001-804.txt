662 EXHALANT SYSTEM. and approximate to those produced by the ex- haiants on the other surfaces where these vessels open. If I intended to classify the different hemor- rhages, I should divide them, 1st. Into those pro- duced by exhalation; 2dly. Those caused by la- ceration. Jn the former I should include the san- guineous perspiration, the mucous, serous, and cel- lular hemorrhages, &c. in the latter, those which attend wounds, aneurisms, &c. It appears to me, that to comprise all the sanguineous dis- charges that may occur in the animal economy, this division, which besides coincides both with the phenomena and treatment of hemorrhages, must necessarily be adopted. Would bleeding be prescribed to stop an hemorrhage proceeding from laceration ? No, undoubtedly not; but we bleed to stop an active hemorrhage from the ex- halants, because, by reducing the vascular mass, the excess of organic sensibility that produces the hemorrhage will also be reduced ; it is nearly the same thing as when bleeding is used in in- flammation. The hemorrhage must subside as it was produced ; the sensibility of the exhalants must be restored to its natural type before the blood will cease to flow. Bleeding is not intended to divert the course of the blood, as it is said ; il this were the case, it would be practised in passive hemorrhage. The generality of physicians, who

OF THE DARK BLOOD. 485 injected in veins, let them be ever so irritating, the animal gives no sign of pain. Urine, bile, wine, narcotics, &c., may, in this respect, be thrown in with impunity, ^thly. On the contrary, when a bubble of air is forced into them, the animal by his cries expresses the most excruciating pains, is agitated, and struggles previous to death; but is this caused by the contact of the fluid on the common membrane ? I do not believe it, because in general, a moment elapses between the cries of the animal and the act of injecting. It might certainly happen that pain would be experienced at that moment only, when the air, after crossing the lungs, comes in contact with the brain, a com- munication which, as I have before stated, always exists. Animal contractility is evidently wanting in veins. The same experiments that have demon- strated its absence in the arteries, equally prove it here. I have tried them on the two species of vessels at the same time, and shall refer them for this point to the preceding system. Properties of Organic Life. Sensible Contractility. This property does not appear to belong to the veins. Haller, by irritating them in various ways, has perceived in them no sensible motion.

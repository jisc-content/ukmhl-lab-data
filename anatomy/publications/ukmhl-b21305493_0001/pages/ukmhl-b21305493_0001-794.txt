EXHALANT SYSTEM. 652 afforded those of the mucous membranes, which are so disposed to suffer this fluid to transude, that innumerable circumstances will produce hemor- rhage in this membrane: 5thly. Why, even amongst the mucous exhalants, some more readily than others admit of a passage for the blood, &c. &c. All these phenomena evidently proceed from the peculiar modifications that distinguish organic sensibility, and the corresponding contractility in each species of exhalants. SECTION II. Natural Exhalations. All I have just stated, most clearly leads to an explanation how exhalation is performed : one principle only has hitherto been advanced for this purpose. The same will still be made use of to explain the secretions, absorptions, &c. There is, between the elements that form each exhaled fluid, and the organic sensibility of each species of exhalant, such a connection, that those elements only can be admitted in the vessels that refuse and reject the others, as long as their mode of sensibility undergoes no change. The general capillary system seems to be, as I have said be- fore, the reservoir in which the blood is elabo-

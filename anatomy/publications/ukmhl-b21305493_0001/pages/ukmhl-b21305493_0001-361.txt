Cicatrization of nerves is then analogous to that of the bones. In the first place, inflamma- tion ; in the second, growth of the cellular mem- brane, which is intended to fulfil the office of a nutritive parenchyma; in the third place, ad- hesion ; in the fourth, exhalation of the medul- lary substance in the parenchyma: it is this me- dullary substance that causes this cicatrization to differ from that of bones in which the calcareous phosphates and gelatine are deposited, and that of the muscles which is penetrated by the fibrine: sometimes at the point of union in the nerves there is an excrescence in the form of a ganglion ; this proceeds from the greater increase of the cellular membrane. Thus, the callus of bones is sometimes protuberant, on other occa- sions, if the parts have been in close contact, only a trifling difference is perceived. Such are the varieties, which alter in no respect, the na- tural process of cicatrization. From all this it results, that the regeneration of the nerves, which of late has been a great ob- ject of research, and particularly demonstrated by Cruikshank, Monro, &c., present, as I have al- ready mentioned, nothing particular in respect to y 2

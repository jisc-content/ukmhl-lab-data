The nerves of which we are now treating*, particularly the latter, have, like the pre- ceding ones, a disposition perfectly analogous with cerebral nerves; they are composed of whitish cords, which proceed from filaments. The eye cannot discover any distinction betwixt them. 3rdly. Several filaments proceeding from the ganglions resort to some cerebral muscles, as the diaphragm to some of those of the neck, &c.; others proceed to the adjoining organs. 4thly. The greater part projecting from the ganglions in insulated filaments, interweave in the form of a plexus with those of the neighbouring ganglions, near to, or upon the large vessels. The most remarkable of these is the solar plexus, which is formed by the innumerable branches proceeding from the semi-lunar, then the hy- pogastric, the cardiac, &c.; the greater part are not exclusively produced by the nerves of organic life; those of animal life assist also in their formation; the par-vagum affords an instance in respect to the solar and cardiac plexus; the nerves of the sacrum in respect to the hypogas- tric, &c.; however, in the plexus the nerves of organic life always predominate: it is only the pulmonic or the par-vagum that are exceptions, whilst the nerves proceeding from the inferior cervical ganglions appear to be only accessory.

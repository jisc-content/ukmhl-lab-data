OF ANIMAL LIFE. 147 atic, they are all equal. In the optic nerve, al- though of a tubular shape through its whole ex- tent, from the commissure to the eye, does not appear to have that plaiting which the others exhibit so evidently. 4thly. In the posterior part of this nerve, and in the trunk of the olfactory, the cords are not distinct. 5thly. In most nerves the filaments, at their origin, are insulated. The trigemini, on the contrary, exhibit a common pulpous portion, in which its filaments seem to be implanted, &c. From all these considerations, and from many others-, for which we are particularly indebted to Reil, it follows, that the interior conformation of nerves varies in a particular manner ; that almost every one of them present a different texture ; that in this respect they bear no resemblance to the arteries nor to the veins, which are in every in- stance alike, whatever may be their volume, their course, &c. These varieties, however, do not af- fect their intimate structure. It is this structure which it concerns us to point out accurately in the last filaments that can be separated. Reil ap- pears to me to have thrown a considerable light on this subject. I have repeated with exactitude his experiments, and have obtained results very analogous to his own : a few only have appeared to me so difficult, that I have not even attempted to undertake them. To his researches I have added a considerable number of new facts, which â™¦

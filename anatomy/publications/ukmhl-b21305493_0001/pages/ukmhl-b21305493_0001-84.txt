xliv GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. tise upon Life.” I shall, besides, in this have frequent opportunities of detailing’ their influence on all organs. I am about to examine a property of which very little has been said till now, which chemists have demonstrated in their experi- ments, and physiologists frequentty mistaken for irritability, but which is in effect as completely distinct from it as it is from the contractility of tissue; I mean the faculty of contracting and shortening itself on the application of certain stimuli. This property will be separately ex- amined in individual organs: I shall consider it here under a general point of view. Every organized part subjected, after death, as well as during life, to the action of fire or of con- centrated acids, will start, contract in various dif- ferent ways, and be almost as agitated as the irritable organs in a state of excitation. This property must, therefore, be considered in the agents which call it into action, in the organs where it resides, and in its phenomena. 1st. Fire is the principal agent of the con- traction of fibre. Every living organ exposed to a red heat involuntarily undergoes such con- traction in the highest degree. 2dly. The strong- est acids rank next to fire ; first, the sulphuric, then the nitric, and lastly the muriatic, excite it in a corresponding ratio. They lose this power in proportion as we dilute them, and if naturally weak scarcely possess it in any degree. The

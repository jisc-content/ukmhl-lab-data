249 OF ORGANIC LIFE. A phenomenon nearly analogous, is produced by concoction : 1st. Contraction and hardening at the moment of ebullition ; 2ndly. Continuance of this state, for the space of half an hour; 3dly. Softening gradually brought on; when this is completed, the coction is finished. In this respect, ganglions are perfectly different from nerves submitted to the same experiment. I have also observed, that in veal they have a very different taste from the nerves, a mode of trial, which, (to appreciate properly the difference of nature in the organs) ought not to be neglected. In fact, as we are not yet acquainted with the various principles that enter into the composition of each, we must be satisfied with ascertaining the differences of qualities. Alkalies act in some degree on the ganglions, which they tend to dissolve, and which they will actually dissolve in part, if they are very caustic. But this dissolution is attended with much more difficulty, and requires much more time, than that of the cerebral pulp submitted to the same trial. Ganglions resist putrefaction as long, and even longer than the nerves. This is another very remarkable difference between them and the cerebral substance. In general, it may be established as a principle, that there is no kind of analogy between them. The texture of ganglions does not appear to be of a fibrous nature. A slight inspection will VOL. 1.

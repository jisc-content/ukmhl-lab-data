By this anastomosis it is explained why, when the tube containing mercury is placed in an absorbent, many others around it are filled. This mode of union is the more necessary, be- cause the course of the lymph, like that of the dark blood, in consequence of not being provided with an impulsive agent, is liable to be obstruct- ed by a variety of causes. Gravity, the external motions, the different com- pressions, &c. particularly the first of these causes, have the same influence upon this fluid as upon that in the veins. It is well known that subse- quent to long continued diseases, however little the strength be reduced, an upright posture con- tinued causes the legs to swell: this explains why in this instance they are always more swelled in the evening than in the morning. With regard to compression, there is not a single one, if rather strong and including many absorbents, but will also produce swelling. It is not the ex- tent of the surface compressed that produces this phenomenon ; it is only the number of the absor- t bents with which the surface is supplied : thus the displacement of the head of the humerus, by sliding in luxation under the arm-pit, frequently causes the arm to swell, whilst compressions of greater ex- tent, on a level with the deltoid muscle, where but few absorbents are met with, does not pro- duce that effect, Â«&c.

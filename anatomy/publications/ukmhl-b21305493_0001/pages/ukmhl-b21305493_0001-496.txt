VASCULAR SYSTEM 354 have not assigned the limits of vital properties, and of texture. The contractility of the texture in the longi- tudinal direction is proportionally less striking than in the other; however, it does exist. 1st. Thus it happens, that when an artery is divided between two ligatures, the two ends instantly con- tract in opposite directions. 2ndly. This retrac- tion is evident in amputation ; however, as that of the skin, and of muscles, is more considerable, the artery often projects a little. 3dly. If cut transversely in a portion of its coats, an artery will frequently present in that part a wide open- ing, depending upon the retraction of the divided parts, similar to that of the longitudinal wound I have just mentioned. 4thly. It is particularly at a time when an artery has been strongly drawn, and suddenly let loose, that its re-action is re- markably displayed. In making this experiment on an animal, the vessel evidently contracts with- in the flesh. Thus it happens, that the spermatic artery and cord, drawn by the weight of the tes- tis, will frequently after the section contract within the abdomen, if not properly secured. It is this very circumstance that has induced me to propose for the operation of sarcocele, a modification, which is, after having perfectly separated the cord at the end of the first incision, 1st. To find out the vas deferens, which is easily indicated in the vascular mass by its firm-

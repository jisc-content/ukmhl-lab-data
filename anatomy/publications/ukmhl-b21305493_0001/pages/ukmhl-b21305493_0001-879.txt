From what I have hitherto stated, it may be observed that we have still but a few un- connected notions respecting the circulation of lymph; that the motion in the veins, although requiring more extended researches, is better known, and that to present a sum of proper in- vestigation on these two points, especially on the former, much ulterior labour and many experi- ments are required. SECTION IV. m Of Absorption during the different Stages of Life. In the foetus, and in the infant, the absorption which relates to nutrition is not in proportion to exhalation ; a number of substances remain in the organs; few are expelled ; hence growth. The interior absorptions of synoviae, serum, fat, marrow, &c. <&c. are but imperfectly known in their differences at those stages. The external absorptions appear much more active ; for, as it is well known, we take infection much more readily in the early years of life ; it has not yet, however, been ascertained whether

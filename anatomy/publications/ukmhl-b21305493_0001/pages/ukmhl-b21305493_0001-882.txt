740 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. certainly not; no more than if, because the brain and the liver are much developed in the foetus, and that nutrition is very active in this subject, we mistook these organs for the agents of this func- tion. Each organ is itself the machine, that sepa- rates from the blood and from the fluids conveyed to it, the nutritive substances that are adapted to them, to appropriate them subsequently. The muscle separates the fibrine, the bone, the cal- careous phosphates, &c. but there is no common and central organ to elaborate these nutritive mat- ters, as there exists a common viscus to move the blood and a central organ to preside over sensi- bility, &c. In regard to the anatomical state of the absor- bents in the foetus and in the infant, we cannot ascertain it. I have never heard that any author has injected them in those stages, to compare them with those of the adult. I possess but one single fact on this head. It is, that the lacteal vessels \ examined in an experiment performed on two young dogs, only eight days after they had left the mother, have appeared to me proportionally larger than at a more advanced age. I shall make a re- mark in this respect which Xhavebeen struck with; it is, that the stature has less influence on the dia- meter of these organs than might be supposed ; for instance, these vessels are not double the size in an adult dog, that is, twice as large as another. Chance enabled me to consider them the same day

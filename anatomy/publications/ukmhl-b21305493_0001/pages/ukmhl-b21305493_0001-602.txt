VASCULAR SYSTEM 460 from the trunk of the vena cava enters by one extremity of this vein, that of the loins by the other. Such a movement evidently implies the absence of valves in the renal vein from the vena cava up to the insertion of the azygos, in fact, the renals never contain any ; the capsular, those which supply the fat of the loins, all the lombar veins, are, as Haller has ascertained, equally un- provided with them ; and I have constantly ascer- tained it myself. This want of valves in those parts where the anastomosis of the vena azygos exists, is a very remarkable phenomena, and fully proves the use I ascribed to the communication existing between the vena cava by their means.

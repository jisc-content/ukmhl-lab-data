VASCULAR SYSTEM 366 he considers? From the absence of sensible or- ganic contractility, as we have observed in the tissue, it is evident that its action must essentially be passive; that the motion, of which it is the seat, is communicated to it; that the heart is the great impulsive agent, in the pulsation of the arteries; that from this organ proceeds the im- pulse which these vessels merely obey; and that, consequently, in almost every case, the state of the pulse implies that the vital forces of the heart, and not the state of the arterial system, whose degree of vitality is more increased in the most frequent and considerable pulsations, than in the slowest and most feeble. Thus, in the con- vulsions produced by a wound, an irritation on the brain, &c. nerves, although the conveying agents, are quite in a passive state, or nearly so. I shall now examine minutely this important question, which several physicians have regarded in quite a different sense. The Influence of the Heart on the Motion of the Red Blood. 1st. The first reason that induces me to believe, that in respect to the vitality in the circulation of the red blood, the heart is all, and that arteries are essentially passive, is the comparison of the vital powers of these two organs, the astonishing activity of organic contractility in the heart, and

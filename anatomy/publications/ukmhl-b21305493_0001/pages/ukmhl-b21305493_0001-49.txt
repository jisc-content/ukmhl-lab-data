IX general considerations. diseases is less numerous. They are exempt from the whole class of nervous diseases in which ani- mal sensibility plays such an active part ; from convulsions and palsies, which are produced by an increase or diminution of animal contractility ; from fevers and visceral affections, &c., arising from disordered states of the sensible organic con- tractility, &c. Tumours of different kinds, in- creased exhalations, marasmus, &c. are the diseases of vegetables: they all suppose a dis- turbed state of organic sensibility, and insensible organic contractility. If we pass from vegetables to animals, we shall find, that the last of these, the zoophytes, re- ceive in a bag, which is alternately empty and full, the food intended for their nourishment; that they begin to unite sensible organic contractility, or irritability, with the above properties, which they share with vegetables; and consequently perform various functions,â€” digestion in par- ticular. So far, organized bodies live only within them- selves : they have no relation with surrounding matter, they are without animal life, or at least, if it exists in the animal plants, its rudiments are so obscure, that they can hardly be distinguished. This life, nevertheless, displays itself in the supe- rior classes, in worms, insects, molluscee, &c. On the one hand sensations, on the other voluntary motion, which is inseparable from them, are de-

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 90 surfaces, blood-vessels, and excretories; a diffe- rence that explains the scarcity of inflammations and tumours in the latter. It is frequently an insuperable barrier to the diseases of the former, and thus defeats the organ it encloses. As a proof of this, I have often observed in dissec- tions post mortem, that while the common tissue in which the arteries are buried are in a state of absolute suppuration, as in the axilla, that con- stituting the outer sheath of the vessels is per- fectly sound. I have witnessed the same appear- ance in the tissue surrounding the ureter in the psoas abscess. SECTION III. Properties of Re-production. Jx • ( * • *J^.1 +± j .

Influence of the Cellular Membrane in the Forma- tion of Cicatrices. Cicai rices may be considered under a twofold aspect: 1st. In external organs, and particularly

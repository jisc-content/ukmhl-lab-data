VASCULAR SYSTEM 468 membrane essentially differs from the other. This single phenomenon, so decisively striking in both of these membranes, would indisputably prove their organic distinctions, as it establishes the ne- cessity of viewing them in a general light, whe- ther it be, that for the dark blood they line the veins, the pulmonary artery and the right side of the heart, or that for the red they extend over the arteries, the left part of the heart and pulmo- nary veins. Valves of the Veins. The common membrane of the dark blood is remarkable for a number of folds called valves. These folds are wanting in the pulmonary artery, except in its origin, where the sigmoid valves are placed; in the heart the tricuspid valves are partly formed by this membrane, but those of the veins are exclusively formed by it. It is these in particular that we are now considering. The form of the valves is a parabolic ; the convex edge is adherent, and the farthest from the heart; the other is straight and floats within. Between these and the vein, a space is left similar to that of the sigmoid aortic, and pulmonic valves. Their free edge is not, like thfe provided with a granulation. At ,-that part where they are at- tached, the veinous tissue is firmer, and provided with a kind of thickening or prominence, form-

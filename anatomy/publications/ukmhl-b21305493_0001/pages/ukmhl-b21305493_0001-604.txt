V A SC(J LA LI SYSTEM 462 veins, where it ascends against its own weight; it is a further proof that man was originally intend- ed for an upright posture. I have repeatedly made a further remark ; it is, that in superficial veins these fibres are much more striking than in those which lay deeper; of this the internal saphena affords a striking instance. A longitudinal incision will show these fibres very distinctly through the common membrane, espe- cially if it be rather contracted. By dividing the femoral vein in a similar manner, the distinction is easily made, a distinction which probably is derived from the assistance which the neighbour- ing parts give to the circulation in deep seated veins, whilst this is much less useful to those which are more superficial. The fibres are proportionally more obvious in the smaller branches than in the trunks; from thence proceeds the greater proportionate thick- ness of their parieties, their more powerful resist- ance to the action of the blood, their less frequent dilatation, &c. In those parts where a division projects from a trunk, these fibres alter their course and continue with the division, differing in this respect from the origin of the arterial divisions, whose fibres are not a continuation of those of the trunks., The veinous fibres often approach, are concen- trated, and give a greater degree of thickness to the vein; this is frequently remarked at the ori-

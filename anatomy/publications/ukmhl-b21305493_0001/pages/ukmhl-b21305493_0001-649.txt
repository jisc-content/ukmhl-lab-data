Anatomists are perfectly acquainted with the difference between veins and arteries at the two opposed stages of life : they select aged subjects to study the veins; these subjects on the contrary, are perfectly untit for arterial injections, so suc- cessful, and even, sometimes, too much so in the child, in which the whole appears one mass of vessels, whilst the investigation of the veins would be extremely difficult, or even impossible. In old age the veins of the upper parts are ge- nerally more dilated than the others ; this is owing to the constant weight of the column of blood ; for, as it has been stated, the veinous circulation, from a deficiency of the power that produces it, is very liable to be influenced by mechanical causes : hence, varices are much more frequent in the lower than in the upper parts of the body, where they are rarely met with. In women that have borne many children, this dilatation in the veins of the lower regions is still more striking, and in general it is more common in females. This affection appears also to be the badge of old age, whilst aneurisms, on the contrary, are less frequent at this period. Rupture of the veins has also been almost as con- r u 2

531 OF THE DA UK BLOOD. a succession of facts strictly deduced from each other. The hepatic artery lias been assimilated to the bronchial, and the vena porta to the pulmonary artery. This is correct, in reference to the gene- ral disposition ; but in regard to the functions, where is the proof? On the contrary, I have previously established, that those of the two last vessels have not the same result. Before deciding, let us then wait for later and positive researches ; till then, let us not attribute the secretion of bile either to the hepatic artery, to the vena porta, or to both in common. It is undoubtedly pro- duced by one of these three, but which are the vessels that secrete the bile ? what part the dark abdominal blood acts in the liver, if from this fluid the bile be not separated? what function, in short, does the hepatic artery perform, if it has nothing to do with this secretion ? Here are several questions still to be resolved. The opinions of physicians respecting the in- fluence of the dark abdominal blood, in dis- eases, tyiave also been suppositions ; it may cer- tainly be the case that the phrase, vena por- taram, porta malorum, in point of signification may be very correct, but in the present state of the science it is nothing taken in a literal sense, but a play upon words. If it be used to express how frequent the affections of the liver are, it is no doubt correct; but if intended

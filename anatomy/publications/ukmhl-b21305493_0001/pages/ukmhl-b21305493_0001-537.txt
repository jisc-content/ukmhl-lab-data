When one of these pouches lias been laid bare, the membranes must be divided, then also the belly of the young animal, without injur- ing the umbilical vessels. The transparency of the parts renders it easy to perceive the similarity of colour in the blood of the vena cava and of the aorta. The same remark applies to the superior parts ; the same kind of blood flows from the ca- rotid artery or the jugular vein when they are opened. 2dly. I have made these observations at three different times in the foetuses of dogs. 3dly. It is well known that the blood of the umbilical arteries is constantly black ; every accoucheur has ascertained this fact. 4thly. It cannot be doubted that the change of the dark blood into red pro- ceeds from the contact of air in the lungs; the foetus being unable to perform that function, cannot then be provided with this kind of blood. 5thly. I have frequently dissected dead foetuses in the parent’s womb, but the blood of the arteries and that of the veins has always appeared to me of the same nature. It is true that this last instance is not a very conclusive proof, since ad- mitting that red blood existed, its stagnation only in these vessels, if continued for a certain time, would, as Hunter as judiciously remarked, be sufficient to make it black. ✓ The preceding facts, besides, suffice to establish k k 2

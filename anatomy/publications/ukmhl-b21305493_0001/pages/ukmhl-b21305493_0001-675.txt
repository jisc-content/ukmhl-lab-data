OF THE I>AUK BLOOD. 533 „ first glance, were not so, however, in reality, of which I have had frequent opportunities of being convinced, by repeating them at the different stages of digestion, and during the abstinence of the animal, which had not been done before with accuracy. The following is whatT have observed in the dogs, made use of in my experiments. 1st. During abstinence, the stomach and the small intestines being empty, the bile in the hepa- tic and common canals is yellow and clear; the surface of the duodenum, and jejunum, is tinged by a bile of a similar appearance ; the gall bladder is very much distended by a greenish bile, bitter, and of a deeper hue, in proportion as the fasting has been longer continued. 2nd. During digestion in dhe stomach,—that may be extended to some length of time by giving the dog large pieces of meat, which the animal swallows without chewing,—things remain nearly in the same state. 3rd. At the commencement of intestinal diges- tion, the bile in the hepatic canal still remains yellow ; that in the ductus choledocus acquires a deeper hue; the gall bladder is not so full, and its bile appears of a lighter colour. 4th. Towards the end of digestion, and imme- diately after, the bile of the hepatic and common ducts, that contained in the gall bladder, and that extended over the duodenum, have precisely

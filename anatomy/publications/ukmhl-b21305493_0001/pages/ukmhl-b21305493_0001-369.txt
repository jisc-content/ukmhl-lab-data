OF ANIMAL LIFE. 227 event black blood only circulates in its vessels. The speedy difference which the circulation un- dergoes must evidently influence its functions. In fact, if the least foreign substance differing from the red blood be propelled during life to- wards the brain, by means of the carotid, it is sufficient to cause very material mischief, and frequently even death itself, as I have very often ascertained in my experiments. Why? Because it is not only as a vehicle of the nutritive substance that the fluid which is impelled by the arteries acts upon the brain, but also as an ex- citating agent, as a stimulant. The change in ex- citation which the brain suddenly experiences at birth must unavoidably increase its vital activity, endow it with a new one, and render it fit for functions which it could not fulfil before those of perceiving sensations. Asphyxia really exists whenever the lungs are not inflated after birth, when they are not filled with air, and consequently do not send red blood to the brain. Some motions in the muscles may undoubtedly be perceived; but animal life never begins completely until the organs that perform it are influenced by the red blood. This blood is a general cause of internal excitement; this direct excitement acts simultaneously with the sympathy which the brain experiences from the skin, and tbe mucous surfaces which exterior agents in- stantly excite, when the foetus is expelled.

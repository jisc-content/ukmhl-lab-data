739 absorbant system. other strongly disposed to disease, the functions of these organs are more active. Thus when the brain and nerves are strongly characterized, sen- sibility is more active. Thus again, when larger than usual the vessels of the arterial system are connected with abundant nutrition, &c.; in youth, it is when the genital organs unfold the most, and that they are the more exposed to disease, that their functions become more striking. If we ex- amine every organ and their functions, we shall find that a general law of the economy is included in the three following facts, which are constantly united, namely : 1st. Considerable developement. 2dly. A stronger tendency to disease. odly. More activity in the functions. Now, since the two first exist together in the glands of the absorbents, we must conclude that the third is superadded, although we cannot posi- tively prove it, since from what has been stated, we cannot ascertain the uses of these small or- gans. Grimaud, it is true, actually considered them as essential to nutrition, he has even denominated the whole mass of these glands, and of the cellular tissue, the nutritive system ; an idle supposition without foundation. All we know on this point is, that nutrition on one part, the developement of these glands on the other, are very forward in the foetus; but does it follow from this, that the former phenomenon is derived from the latter?

258 NERVOUS SYSTEM to that of the cerebral nerves and those of the ganglions, is, that their phenomena in the state of health are very distinct. Halle has very judi- ciously observed, that the painful sensations we experience in such parts as receive nerves from ganglions, have a peculiar character ; that they do not resemble those experienced in such parts as are supplied by the cerebral nerves. Thus, the painful sensations of the loins from affections of the womb, from vinous injections of the tunica vaginalis, &c., a sensation that seems to me to arise from the sympathetic influence of the af- fected organ on the lombar ganglions; thus, the acute pains in the intestines, the sensation of burning in the epigastrium, cannot be assimi- lated to the painful sensations experienced in ex- ternal parts: they are deep, and go to the heart, according to the common expression. We are aware that there are such things existing as colics, which are essentially nervous, and which undoubtedly are quite independent of all local affections of the serous, mucous, and muscular systems of the intestines. These colics are evi- dently seated in the nerves of the semi-lunar ganglions, which overrun the whole course of the abdominal arteries ; they constitute real nevral- gies in the nervous system of organic life: then, these have positively no connection with the tic douloureux, the sciatica, and the other nevralgies of animal life. The symptoms, the

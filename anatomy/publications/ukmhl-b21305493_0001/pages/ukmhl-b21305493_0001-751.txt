609 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. sion of foreign substances in the blood, through respiration, digestion, or even cutaneous absorp- tion ; 2nd. The combination of these substances with the blood in hematosis ; 3rd. Their circula- tion in the arterial system are three general phe- nomena, common to secretions, exhalations, nu- trition, and the formation of heat.» 'C * Caloric then reaches the capillary system com- bined with the matter for the secretions, that for D £> ! ! exhalation, and that intended for nutrition. The r • blood is the common fluid resulting from all these combinations. Each part is separated in the general capillary system ; the caloric to extend throughout the body, and be afterwards emitted; the fluids for secretions to flow from the glands; those for exhalations to transude through their respective surfaces, and the nutritive substance to remain in the organs. It appears to me that an explanation, which represents nature as constantly pursuing a regular course in all her works, drawing all her results from the same principles, affords at once a degree of probability very different from that which represents her insulating, as it were, this pheno- menon from all others, by the manner in which it is produced. It is of little consequence by whatever mode caloric is introduced into the system. Vegetables that have no lungs, but air tubes and absorbents; fishes that are [possessed of gills; all enjoy an

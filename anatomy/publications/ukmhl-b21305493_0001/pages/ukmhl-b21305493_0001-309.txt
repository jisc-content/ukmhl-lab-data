OF ANIMAL LIFE. 167 optic, auditory and olfactory nerves, this assertion is proved by inspection. In general I think that this substance, as well as the cerebral, excepting the nerves that pervade them, ought rather to be classified among the fluids than amongst solids; or it may be considered to hold a medium state between the two. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Nervous System in Animal Life. Cellular Membrane, The nerves are completely deprived of their membrane in the interior of the cranium and of the spine, but outwardly they are plentifully supplied with it. They are in the first place covered by a large external layer, that connects them with the neighbouring parts. This is of a slacker texture than that which encloses the arteries; adipose matter very frequently accumulates within. In dropsies it is sometimes, though rarely, infiltrated with serum. From this common layer different projections pass outwardly, and communicate with the cellu- lar membrane of the neighbouring organs. Other projections also take place, and are continued between the nervous cords, which they separate from each other, and supply with a kind of ducts

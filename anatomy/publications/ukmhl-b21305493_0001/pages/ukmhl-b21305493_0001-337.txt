195 OF ANIMAL LIFK. increase a little the organic sensibility of the nerves which cross it, rendering their nutrition a little more active, and rather increasing their vo- lume ; but in general, this phenomenon is infi- nitely less remarkable than in the muscles. On the other hand, although nerves have been de- prived of the power of transmitting sensation and motions, especially the latter, they still preserve, for a considerable time, the same degree of organic sensibility; and nutrition fulfils its office as usual. I have several times, in hemiplegia, com- pared the nerves of the sound side with those of the affected one, and have found no difference in them. It is only in cases where a limb is ulti- mately afflicted with atrophy, which does not generally take place but after a very considerable lapse of time ; it is only in such cases, I say, that the bulk of the nerve is diminished. I have also frequently inquired, if, when a part in which there are nerves, and which for a long space of time has been the seat of uninterrupted painful sensations, the process of nutrition is af- fected ; and consequently, if organic sensibility is deranged. I have dissected the stomachic cords in cancerous pylorus, the uterine nerves in those of the womb, and, excepting in two sub- jects, in whom they were rather increased, could never perceive any difference. Desault has also found, in a subject afflicted with carcinoma in the fingers, the median nerve of an increased size ;

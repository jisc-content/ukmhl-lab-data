CELLULAR SYSTEM. 63 web arranged into plates, which form its princi- pal part, and of such exquisite delicacy that they may be compared to air bubbles. We can discern no fibres in the texture of these plates which are perfectly uniform. They are evidently crossed by an infinity of filaments, which follow no precise direction, are variously interwoven to- gether, and are in close contact when the cellu- lar tissue is gathered and condensed into a packet, but once distended, exhibit these plates of which I have spoken in the spaces between them. Consequently, in extending the cellular packet* it forms a membrane of considerable breadth— the filaments are drawn asunder so as to leave certain interstices between them, wherein the in- termediate plates are distinctly seen. What is the nature of these filaments ? I am disposed to think that some are absorbents, others exhalants, and, that a certain number are formed for the formation of cells at that part where the plates are united together. In short, we observe lines strongly marked on the cellular tissue when it is stretched out, corresponding to the union of the plates where the thickness of the tissue is in- creased. I am induced to think so from the fol- lowing circumstance:—If, instead of pursuing the preceding mode of investigation, we examine the cellular tissue in a state of artificial emphy- sema, as it is exhibited in the market, we shall only perceive the non-filamentous plates I have

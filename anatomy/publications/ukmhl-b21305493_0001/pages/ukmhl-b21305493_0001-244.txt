CELLULAR SYSTEM. 102 the cicatrisation of superficial parts, it is obvious to remark, 1st, why they so intimately adhere to those parts where they are formed, and never have the looseness of the common integuments; 2dly, why the skin is drawn together from the neigh- bouring parts to cover the wound; 3dly, why it wrinkles in approaching the wound; 4thlv, why â€¢ Jn those parts where it' yields the most, as the scrotum and axilla for instance, the cicatrix is the least extensive, &c.; why, on the other hand, it should be much more limited in extent where the skin does not yield with equal facility, as in the sternum, cranium, and trochanter major, &c.; 5thly, why the thickness of every cicatrix is in- variably in the inverse ratio of its extent; in fact, as there are uniformly the same number of granulations that unite together to form the cicatrix, we cannot deny that what it gains in one way it loses in another, whence there re- sults, that those which are of considerable extent are easily ruptured ; Gthly? why they have no re- gular organization, do not partake of the func- tions of the cutaneous organ that they re-implace, and why their texture is absolutely distinct from that of the latter organ. The cicatrisation of wounds abandoned to the care of nature, and especially when there is waste of substance, differs materially from their union by the first intention, which is ascertained from the agglutination of their edges: the reason of

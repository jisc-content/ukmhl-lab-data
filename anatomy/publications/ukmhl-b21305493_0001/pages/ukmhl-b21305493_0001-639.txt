OF THE DARK BLOOD. 497 fined to one single organ (as is the case with arteries), it is evident that this motion cannot be uniform; that it must vary according to the state of the capillary system in the different parts. This, in fact, we find to be the case, particularly in the external parts, where the veins are more or less swelled in proportion as the blood flows through their tubes with more or less rapidity. In arteries, on the contrary, the motion is every where the same; there is a sudden and general shockâ€”an impulse, which, felt every where at the same moment, must necessarily be uniform throughout: thus we never find that some arte- ries are more filled than others, as is the case with veins. In general, there is room for extensive research respecting the motion of blood in veins. Not- withstanding what authors have written on this question, it is still almost involved in darkness. These difficulties arise from our not being pre- cisely acquainted with the mode and form of the motion communicated to the blood in the capillary system, what kind of influence the vascular pa- rieties have upon this fluid, &c. Our discoveries in this respect are restricted to a few conceptions which I have just advanced, and which relate especially to the comparison of the veinous and arterial circulations. I believe that this compari- son continued at some future day, will throw considerable light on the veinous circulation ; in

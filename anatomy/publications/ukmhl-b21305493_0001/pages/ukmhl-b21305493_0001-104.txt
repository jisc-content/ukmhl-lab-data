lxiv GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. own structure ? 6thly. It is an avowed fact that many, very many of the sympathetic pains we refer to bones, have their exclusive seat in the medulla. I might produce examples without number to prove that in no instance whatever it is the whole organ that sympathises, but certain parts of the same organ. This is besides a natural consequence arising from the very nature of sympathies. They are nothing, in effect, but disordered states of vital properties: accordingly, these properties, varying in each tissue, their sympathies cannot be alike. Let us consider the character of the fever that is attendant upon the phlegmasiee. In inflammation of the mucous membranes it is comparatively trifling: in the serous membranes it is uniformly intense ; and in the skin it has the peculiar feature of displaying itself several days before the eruption, as Pinel has observed.

From whence does this proceed? From the diversity of the relations which unite the heart with each kind of texture : accordingly this diversity of relations is the result of the diversity of vital powers peculiar to each. Let us only consider the diseases of herpes, psoriasis, syphilis, or cancer, &c. when they have ceased to be local, and affect

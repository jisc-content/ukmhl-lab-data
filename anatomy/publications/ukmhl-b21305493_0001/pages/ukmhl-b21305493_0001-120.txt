Such was the classification which I conceived, in commencing my physiological instructions; it evidently differs from all others that have been hitherto adopted in works on physiology; accord- ingly, a little reflection will suffice to shew its eminent superiority. Let us observe in effect that every class, every order, in this division are possessed of certain generic and characteristic properties, that especially distinguish them, and being applicable to every function of the order, identify them from all the functions of another order. I have elsewhere set down the distinctive attributes of animal and organic life; I have proved that the organs of the one are uniform, and the other irregular ; that there is harmony in the functions of the former, and discord in those of the latter; that the latter begins earlier, and ends later, &c. &c. I have demonstrated that the cerebral nerves especially appertain to animal life; that the

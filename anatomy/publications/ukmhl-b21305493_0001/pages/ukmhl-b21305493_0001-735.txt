CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 593 exhaling' vessels during the most violent exertions of the heart. Is the acceleration of the pulse increased during the periodical discharge ? A plethora of the capillary system, as I have stated frequently, precedes active hemorrhage, but there is never an increase of the action of the heart. The fungous tumours and flabby granula- tions that arise from unhealthy wounds, polypi, &c. emit blood ; but the heart has nothing to do with such hemorrhages, which evidently proceed from the capillary vessels. Are we not convinced that frequently, when the exhalants pour out a great quantity of serous fluids on the membranes of this description, the heart, like every other part, is, in respect to its action, perfectly inert ? Since, then, all the vessels arising from the capillary system afford no kind of harmony in their motions with those of the heart, it is evident that the influence of this organ over the circula- tion of the fluids terminates in the capillary sys- tem. Let us only consider nutrition : it is, un- doubtedly, the capillary system that distributes to every part the materials it has received from the impulse of the heart; but the influence of this organ is not extended to the part where the nutritive substance is deposited. In fact, its im- pulse, every where equal and uniform, propels the blood with nearly an equal degree of energy to all the parts, admitting some exceptions in respect to the foetus, and which have already

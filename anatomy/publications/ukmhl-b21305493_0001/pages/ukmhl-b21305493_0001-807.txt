EXHA LA NT SYSTEM. 665 non in natural philosophy, on the contrary, is nearly immutable, because it is the very nature of physical laws to continue the same. From what I have just stated, it is seen how essentially the hemorrhages of the large arteries that are under the immediate influence of the heart, must differ from those of the capillary system and exhalant vessels, in which cases the phenomena, let them be caused by laceration, or by exhalation, are influenced by the powers of the part where they take place. In fact, although these two classes are, as I have stated, essentially distinguished from each other by their principal phenomena, they have some resemblance, inas- much as the vital powers of the part will neces- sarily influence them from the moment they are in the capillary system. Thus, astringents, tonics, styptics, and other medicinal substances, will fre- quently check the hemorrhages of the capillary system. The admission of air to wounds, by mo- difying these properties, is frequently sufficient to produce this effect. On the contrary, the appli- cation of the ligature only in the large vessels, oppose the powerful influence of the heart. All the styptics imaginable, accumulated upon an open artery, could never prevent the effect of this influence. Such, then, is the essential difference between the hemorrhages of the capillary and exhalant vessels, and those of the arteries, that every medicament calculated to act upon the or- vol. r. 3d

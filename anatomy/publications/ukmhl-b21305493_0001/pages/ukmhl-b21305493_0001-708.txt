CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 566 lion iii fact, is clearly proved on inspection. When an injected serous surface, whose capillary system is filled, is examined, this system proves an actual net work, in which no vascular thread is con- tinued more than the sixth part of an inch, with- out communicating with the others. The passage then, between the part that receives the blood, and that which admits other fluids, is constantly free. A similar disposition is ascertained in the dermoidal system, in the origin of the mucous system, &c., and in general, in all those where the capillary system contains both blood and white fluids. On the other part, the organs that contain white fluids only, evidently communicate with the adjoining, which receive blood; those in which blood seems exclusively admitted, are dis- posed in a similar manner. The capillary system then, must be considered as a general plexus, extended throughout the whole body, communicating on one part with every organ, on the other from one organ to another. There is, in this respect, a general anas- tomosis from head to foot, and a free communi- cation is opened to the fluids. In this manner, the permeability of the body might be admitted, but not in respect to the cellular tissue, in which fat and serum only are found to stagnate. As the arteries open into the capillary system, and as this system also gives rise to the veins, to the

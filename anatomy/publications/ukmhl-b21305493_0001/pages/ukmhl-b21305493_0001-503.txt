OF THE RED BLOOD. 3G1 duce, in this case, no kind of effect: it is the same phenomenon during life as that which has been shewn to occur after death. From this I should suppose it can no longer be doubted that arteries of themselves, and from their vital influence, have no kind of contraction. All that has been advanced in this respect arises, evi- dently, from the contractility of the texture. Thus on opening an artery between two ligatures, it instantly emits the blood, or any other fluid that had accidentally been injected; the same pheno.. menon is produced when only a single ligature has been applied to intercept the action of the heart, &c. It is so far true, that all these pheno- mena, and others similar to them, proceed from the properties of the texture, that they are pro- duced in the corpse, provided the arteries are not in a state of putrefaction. If we fill any portion of the arterial system, and then open one of the tubes, it will instantly empty itself by contract- ing. The contraction produced by the defi- ciency of extension is precisely what charac- terizes the contractility of the texture: irrita- bility, or sensible organic contractility, on the contrary, constantly implies the application of a stimulant.

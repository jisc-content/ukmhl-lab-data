396 VASCULAR SYSTEM as an indisputable fact, the identity of the blood in the two systems of the foetus; an identity ex- isting, at least in the outward appearance, if it does not really exist in the intimate composition of the fluid. It is for chemistry to enlighten us on this subject. How does it happen that at the very moment dark blood penetrates into the arterial system of the adult, severe effects ensue, that soon asphyxia and then death is produced, whilst in the foetus the dark blood circulates in arteries without occa- sioning the slightest injury. It is a very delicate question to resolve, and yet these two contradic- tory facts are equally certain. The difference in the nature of the blood in the foetus might perhaps serve to remove the difficulty, if this difference were better known. In fact, although this fluid, from its colour, is assimilated to that of the veins in the adult, yet it does not seem to be exactly the same ; it has a greasy feel, of which the for- mer does not partake. In the corpse it is never found coagulated like this, but constantly in a fluid state, like the blood of those who have died from strangulation. Fourcroy has not ob- served any fibrous matter in this fluid. He has ascertained that it does not become brittle from the contact of air, that it contains no phospheric, salts, &c. It is then highly probable that if the circulation of the dark blood proves fatal in the arteries of the adult, whilst it circulates with im-

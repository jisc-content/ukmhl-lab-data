178 NERVOUS SYSTEM Animal Sensibility inherent in Nerves, This property is above all that which is the most strongly characterized in nerves. Laid bare, and excited, they cause insufferable pains. On tying a nervous filament, in cauterising, or ex- citing it in any manner whatsoever, this conse- quence, so well known in chirurgical practice, by those who make experiments on living animals, is the constant result. This property would at first appear to establish a very essential distinction between the medullary substance of nerves, and that of the brain, parti- cularly with respect to the convex part of that organ ; for this, when divested of the cortical sub- stance, may be irritated almost with impunity; it is only lower down that animal sensibility becomes strongly characterized; and even then it is not so acute as in the nerves. It should, however, be noticed, that in experiments on the cerebral pulp, we destroy the very organ that perceives; that, without which there can be no animal sensibility, consequently that, whose derangement must un- avoidably influence this property, whereas the seat of perception remains unmolested; where we irritate the nerve, the pain is very acute. It is in fact chiefly in the medullary substance of each nervous filament, that animal sensibility resides. In the theca, it is much less apparent. Hence the

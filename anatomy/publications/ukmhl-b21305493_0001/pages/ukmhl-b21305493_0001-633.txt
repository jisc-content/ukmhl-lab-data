The tissue of these vessels frequently inflames: 1st. Bell has produced several instances proceed- ing from external injuries; 2dly. We are per- fectly acquainted with that attending the piles; 3dly. The cicatrization of the vein subsequent to bleeding is an effect of inflammation. This ci- catrization is undoubtedly promoted by that de- ficiency of impulse to which the arteries are liable, but certainly in similar instances these would not so readily cicatrize. When a ligature has been applied to an artery, it requires, in order to per- form a complete cure, and that it may separate without danger, that the parieties of the tube, inflamed by the action of the ligature, and more frequently lacerated by the compression, be placed in contact; from the difficulty with which arteries inflame, nothing is more difficult to produce than this adhesion. Hence the frequent hemorrhages subsequent to aneurism, and even to every im- portant operation. The blood continues to flow for the space of thirty, and even forty days, or more, and the surgeon, on account of the diffi- culty with which the arterial tissue inflames, should always be very cautious in applying liga- tures on large trunks.

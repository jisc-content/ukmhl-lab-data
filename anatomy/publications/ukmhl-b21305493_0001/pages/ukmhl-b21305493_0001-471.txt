329 OF THE RED BLOOD. By the action of concentrated acids, this tex- ture contracts, softens, and is finally reduced to the form of a pulp, yellowish when nitric acid is the agent, black when it is the sulphuric. The effect of the greater part of the other acids is less powerful than that of these two. When they are diluted, contraction is not produced at the mo- ment an artery is immersed, but the texture sof- tens by degrees, and like that which has been boiled, tears by the slightest effort. For what- ever length of time it is retained in the acid, it can never be reduced to a fluid state. Alkalies, even the caustic, have scarcely any influence on the arterial texture. After a long continued maceration in these fluids it remains nearly unchanged, is but very little reduced by its dissolution, and does not lacerate in the same manner as after having been kept in diluted aci ds. Common Membrane of the System of Red Blood. By this I mean the membrane that lines the arteries, the left part of the heart, and the pul- monary veins. It is easily dissected in these two last organs. To separate it completely in the ar- teries, requires that a superficial incision be made round the external fibrous part, this should then be reversed layer by layer from below upwards. By these means we arrive at the in- vol. ii. F F

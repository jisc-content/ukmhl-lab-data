N till VO US SYSTEM 154 The theca, or n&vrileme, is, in the animal eco- nomy, one of those parts that shrink with the utmost facility, particularly at the moment the nerves are clipped in a rather concentrated acid, as the nitric or sulphuric especially. I have not observed, in any other membrane, this phenome- non in such a striking degree ; the nerve instantly lessens its volume and twists in divers directions. Now, we shall see, that the medullary substance does, not exhibit this phenomenon. A similar effect is produced by the action of boiling water : through its means the nerve is drawn together, contracted and hardened. Afterwards, when ebullition has been continued for a certain time, it softens by degrees, and exchanges its whitish hue for a yellowish one, very distinct from that of a tendon or an aponeurosis that has undergone the same experiment. The action of acids con- tinued for some time, produced an effect analo- gous to that of ebullition. To the sudden tough- ness and hardening which take place when a nerve has been dipt into these, succeeds such a degree of softness, that after some time it will flow between the fingers, and is afterwards partly dissolved. Alkalies do not cause the theca, or any other membrane in living bodies, to contract; neither can they dissolve them. On this account, Reil, having macerated a portion of nerve for some time in soap-lees, has succeeded in separating the

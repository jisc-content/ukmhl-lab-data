85 CELLULAR SYSTEM. fected and the cellular tissue. The two great properties of this tissue, exhalation and absorp- tion, are frequently deranged in acute diseases, giving rise suddenly to swellings, of an oedematous nature. I attended a patient at the Hospital St. Charles, who, from the effects of excessive terror, was unexpectedly seized with a violent constric- tion of the proecordia; his countenance, a few hours afterwards, was covered with a saffron hue, in- dicating the disorder that emotion had ex- cited in the liver. In the course of the same evening, the lower limbs were in an oedematous state, sympathetically produced, no doubt, by the influence of the liver on the cellular tissue. The influence that is exerted by the larger organs of life over this system, is powerfully displayed in chronic diseases, in the derangements that take place in their structure. It is known that the greater proportion of chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, stomach, spleen, liver, and uterus, termi- nate in dropsy, more or less general, owing to the weakness produced by them in the cellular tissue. The healing art is infinitely indebted to Cor- visa, for having demonstratively shown that al- most all infiltrations are symptomatic, and conse- quently referrible to the indirect influence of the organ affected, over the cellular tissue. In the latter instance, the same effect that was spontane- ously and rapidly produced in the patient whose

114 CELLULAR SYSTEM. ARTICLE VJ. Developement of the Cellular Tissue. SECTION i. State of the Cellular System in the early Stage of Life. In the early stage of conception, the embryo is nothing more than a mucous mas, apparently ho- mogeneous, and in which the cellular tissue seems almost exclusively to predominate. In effect, as soon as the organs in this mass begin to unfold, the interstices they leave between them are filled with a substance perfectly similar to that which previously composed the whole body, and may be considered as the remainder of it, or rather as existing in a distinct manner, because it has not been impregnated with a peculiar nutritive substance, like that which forms the nutritive parenchyma of the organs, and which before this impregnation was perfectly similar to it. This substance interposed between the organs, and which forms the rudiments of the cellular tissue, recedes so much the more from the fluid state in proportion as the time of birth draws near. At first it represents actual mucous, subsequently a kind of glue, and finally the cellular texture begins to manifest itself.

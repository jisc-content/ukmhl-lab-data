642 EX HA LAN T SYSTEM. ARTICLE I. General Distribution of the Exhalants. SECTION I. Origin, Course, and Termination. Authors have formed very different opinions in respect to the exhalants. The decreasing tubes stated by Boerhaave, and the error loci, for which his imagination had created them, we are per- fectly familiar with. Latterly, all white organs, as a continuation to arteries, have been rejected, and to explain how exhalation is effected, inor- ganic pores of the arterial parieties, through which the fluids are supposed to transude over the or- gans, are resorted to. The frequent observation of similar transudations in the dead body, such, for instance, as that of bile through the gall blad- der, of marrow through the bony tissue, to which it imparts a yellowish colour, &c. is one es- sential basis on which this manner of viewing the exhaling system rests. But we have already frequently noticed, that these phenomena never take place during life, when the organic sensibi- lity of the parts will not admit of them. Ex- halation besides is evidently subjected to the in-

452 VASCULAR SYSTEM emptied by transmitting the fluid to the others ; why in our tight bandages for cases of fracture and luxations, the blood, as usual, passes from the veins to the heart, although its superficial circulation is much reduced; 4thly. When a bandage has been tightly applied to the su- perior part of the leg, and the saphena is injected below, the injection is never seen to extend beyond the bandage, but passes into the crural vein : the internal jugular may be filled in the same manner, by injecting the temporal vein, &c. The anastomosis between the superficial and the deep veins, is more necessary to man than to any other animal, on account of the clothing by which, according to those in use, the neck, legs, the arms, &c. are exposed to compressions that would otherwise soon prove fatal. It may be said, that from these the possibility of a variety of fashions is founded. In fact, they prove that these fashions are less dangerous than some phy- sicians have pretended ; that the danger of apo- plexy, from wearing a tight cravat, of varices from the pressure of the garter, is much less than has been stated. When a single trunk of a vein is compressed, the blood proceeds without diffi- culty to the next; but if the compression has been extended to all those of a limb, the blood will require some considerable time to dilate the

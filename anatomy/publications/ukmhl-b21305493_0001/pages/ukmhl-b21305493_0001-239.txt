97 CELLULAK SYSTEM. carried serum. This is so true, that when inflam- mation is at an end, and the blood ceases to be admitted into these vessels, the membrane recovers its natural hue, and the granulations in the same manner lose their red colour altogether after ci- catrisation has taken place, because the blood no longer penetrates them. If, on the other hand, there had been any new production of vessels, they would have continued to exist and perform their functions. Besides, how can we admit the developement of blood vessels in those parts where none originally existed, for example, in ten- dons, cartilages, &c. which, like other parts, when divided, are capable of producing granulations. From the above considerations it must be in- ferred that the arterial system has no share in the formation of granulations, and that the cellular tissue is its exclusive agent, inasmuch as that tissue alone has been endowed with the singular property of extending, multiplying, and repro- ducing itself. This then briefly is what takes place in the second stage of the cicatrisation of wounds. The cellular tissue, having acquired an increase of sen- sibility in the first stage, rises into an indefinite number of vesicles, that are scattered here and there, exhale a whitish substance, but little known, unite at their superficies and form a provisionary membrane. But how is this membrane converted into that of the cicatrix ? Let us follow nature

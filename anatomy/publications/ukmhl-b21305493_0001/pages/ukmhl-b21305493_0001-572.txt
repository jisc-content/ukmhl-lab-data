430 VASCULAR SYSTEM In general, the greater part of tumours that are attended with excessive pain, present this pheno- menon. One might, even frequently, be induced to say, that pain in a part is sufficient to produce a determination of blood, and to dilate the arte- ries. We are well aware that, in the operation of the stone, whenever the subject has previously laboured under severe pain, the hemorrhage is frequently the more to be dreaded. I have never observed, subsequent to abundant and long-continued secretions or exhalations, that arteries were more dilated in the glands or round the exhaling organs. Whatever may be the size of the cysts, their parieties never contain arteries proportioned to those developed in the midst of cancerous tumours. The cerebral arteries, in cases of hydrocepha- lus; those of the mediastinum, the intercostals, &c, in hydrothorax; the mesenteric, the lombar, the stomachic, the epigastric, &c. in ascites; the spermatics, in hydrocele; the renals, in diabetes; the branches which project to the parotid glands, subsequent to long-continued salivation ; all pre- serve their natural dimensions, and are even reduced under some circumstances. When arteries are dilated in tumours, do their parieties, as in the preceding instance, acquire a proportionate thickness ? I have nothing to state in this respect. L

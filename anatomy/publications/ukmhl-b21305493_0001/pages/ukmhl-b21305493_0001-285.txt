On the contrary, the communication of the great hypoglossal with the cervical pairs, from whence proceeds the nervous interspace, &c. forms a real anastomosis, because there is continuity, and not merely apposition of the nervous filaments. If those that have considered anastomosis as the exclusive cause of all sympathies, had only re- flected how very few there are, compared with what they seem to be at the first glance, they would have been led by this simple reflection to a different opinion. In fact, it is very evident that, although a filament unites with a trunk, it is no more connected with the filaments of that trunk than those are with each other; that is to say, that it has nothing in common with them more than the cellular covering. The anastomosis of ar^* teries and veins are more frequent than those of the nerves. I believe that these may take an active part in neuralgies, even in some sympathies with which the mere contact of the filaments are not connected. Anastomosis may generally be referred to three classes; 1st, Two branches proceeding from distinct nerves may continue together, as in the instance already mentioned of the great hypoglossal; again, as in the ramifications of the faicial with those of the sub orbitar of the

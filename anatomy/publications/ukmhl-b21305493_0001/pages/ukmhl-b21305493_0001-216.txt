CELLULAR SYSTEM. 74 Exhalcmis. The existence of exhaling vessels is completely established by the following proofs: 1st. By the preceding experiment, which is the natural mode of injecting them'; 2dly. By artificial injec- tions, which, as I have just stated, bring a much greater number of vessels into view than can be perceived in the natural state; 3rdly. By the transudations that take place in the cellular tissue when these injections are propelled with much force: transudations that are in effect a species of artificial exhalation ; 4thly. By na- tural exhalation, which is constantly going on in the living body, and borrows its materials from fat and serum ; 5thly. By accidental exhalations occasionally taking place when blood is extrava- sated, and imparts its own hue to serous infiltra- tions, &c. &c. Generally speaking, there are few systems in the living economy more abundantly supplied with exhaling vessels than the cellular tissue. I speak not of those designed for its nutrition, which are necessary to it in common with other organs. The redundance of these vessels observes a defi- nite proportion to the habitual exhalation that is there existing. On this particular redundance depends the greater frequency of inflammation in those parts which abound with cellular substance, as we shall see hereafter: it subjects it also in i

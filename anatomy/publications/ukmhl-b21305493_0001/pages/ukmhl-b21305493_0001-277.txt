To ascertain with precision from what pairs the median, cubital, &c. proceed, would require a very tedious dissection. It is this consideration which has induced me not to describe the spinal nerves in the usual man- ner ; that is to say, proceeding from such and such pairs. I first describe in each region the plexus that the nerves perform in proceeding from the spine; thus, before the cervical nerves, I describe the deep cervical plexus; before the brachial nerves, the brachial plexus; before the lumbar and sacral, the plexus that bear the same name. The general disposition, the form, the connexion of these being ascertained, I proceed to the description of the nerves which go from them, either forwards, backwards, inwardly or outwardly, &c. without regarding the pairs which project from the foramina. This method has also appeared to me very convenient for pu- pils. For instance, nothing is more complicated than the description of the cervical nerves, in classifying them by the pairs from which they originally proceeded. But make yourself well ac- quainted with the deep-seated plexus proceeding

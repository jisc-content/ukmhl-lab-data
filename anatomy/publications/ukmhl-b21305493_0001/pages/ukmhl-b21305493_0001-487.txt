The first tree of the system of red blood receives the cerebral nerves almost exclusively. In fact, we are aware that the par-vagum extends over all the pulmonary veins, as well as over the vessels adjoining to the lungs, which hardly re- ceive any from the inferior cervical ganglion. 2dJy. The central part of this system, that where the heart is situate, borrows its nerves nearly as much, nay, even more, from the ganglions, than from the brain. 3dly. The large tree of the red, or the arterial circulation, is almost exclusively embraced by the first class of nerves. We have already noticed how these nerves, in this respect, are distributed. The cerebral, by which they are accompanied, scarcely provide the arteries with filaments; they are merely in apposition, as is ascertained in the limbs, in the intercostal spaces, &c. I cannot repeat too often, that the constant connexion between the arteries and the nervous system of the ganglions deserves the attention of physiologists, because it is too general not to be connected with some important object in the functions of the economy, although this is still unknown.

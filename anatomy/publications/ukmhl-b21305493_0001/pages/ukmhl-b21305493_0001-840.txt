698 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 5thly. To prove that there is no veinous ab- sorption on the surface of the intestines, may be added to these considerations the numerous experiments of Doctor Hunter, and we shall find that this mode of absorption will, in these respects, appear very uncertain. If, however, the question be viewed in other respects, it cannot be denied that some facts rather favour this opinion. 1st. It is almost certain that the extremities of the veins draw the blood, as it were by absorpo- tion from cellular bodies. 2dly. No absorbents have been discovered in the placenta and still the umbilical vein receives also the fluids it contains. 3dly. Meckel, having injected a lymphatic vessel resorting to a gland, the injected mercury proceeded to an adjacent vein. All these observations still leave the termina- i tion of the absorbents in obscurity. It is my opinion, that if on the one hand, it cannot be doubted, that the greatest part of these vessels, particularly those which proceed from the serous surfaces, from the cellular tissue, the intestines, &c., have particular terminations, on the other hand, we ought to suspend our judgment respect- ing the mode in which the others terminate, and that in this respect, the question must remain perfectly undecided until elucidated by further

286 VASCULAR SYSTEM their branches, the one to the gastric viscera, the other to the liver, unite in what is termed the sinus of the vena porta, which occupies precisely the situation of the heart in the two great systems of circulation. It is not then difficult to conceive, 1st, How the heart may be deficient, as we have some ex- amples in which the two great circulating sys- tems resemble to a certain extent that of the abdomen: 2dly, How the blood may still circu- late for a considerable time from one ca pillary system to the other;â€”the heart, disordered, en- feebled, or even partially disorganized, has barely any longer the power of propelling this fluid : 3dly, How, although the functions of this organ, as in syncope, asphyxia, &c. be entirely suspended, there is still a circulation (oscillation), an actual progression of the blood from one capillary sys- tem to the other; since, if an artery or vein be opened, it still flows in some degree through the aperture. This circulation is certainly very feeble, and could not be carried on for a length of time ; but it cannot be denied that it may take place without the intervention of the heart, since without any impelling agent the dark blood is readily conveyed from the intestines to the liver, from whence it follows that the cessation of \ * . t action in the heart does not prove (as some au- thors have pretended) that the blood is motion- less: 4-thly, It is known that in several of the

VASCULAR SYSTEM 364 but a very indifferent part; on the other hand, the bony incrustations, and the greater part of the alterations which are so frequent in the other textures, are never met with in this. This tex- ture, in fact, with regard to the scarcity of organic alterations, should be ranged with the cartila- ginous, the fibro-cartilaginous, the fibrous, and even the muscular, &c. These textures display in this respect a phenomenon opposite to that of the serous, mucous, glandular, and dermoid sys- tems, &c. that are particularly characterized by their frequent alterations of structure. Now let us compare together the organic properties, the sensibility, the insensible contractility in each class of the textures, and we shall find them rather obscure in the first, where in the natural state they preside over nutrition only ; whilst in the second, on the contrary, we shall see them strongly characterized, because they are connected with nutrition, exhalation, absorption, secretion, &c. The difficulty with which the arterial texture inflames, and partakes of the various diseases of the adjoining organs, insures in numerous cases the freedom of circulation. What would become of this function if arterial texture, like the others, were so easily affected by surrounding diseases? Almost constantly placed near to parts that are obstructed, inflamed, in a state of suppuration, <&c. if they were affected by contiguity, the

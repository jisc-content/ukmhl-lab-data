I OF THE RED BLOOD. 303 Course of the Ramifications. Whilst the trunks occupy the large spaces that are left between several of the organs, and the branches are lodged in the smaller ones that se- parate two particular organs, the ramifications are situate within these very organs, without, however, entering into their immediate struc- ture. Thus in the muscles they are placed be- tween the fibres, in tbe brain between the con- volutions, in the glands between the lobes that compose them, &c. These communicate an in- ward motion to every organ, and facilitate its function by maintaining its particular activity, as the general activity of a part is kept up by the motion of which I have spoken above. The immediate cessation of life, when the brain is no longer affected by the force of the circulation, proves the intimate connection that exists be- tween this inward motion and its vital energy. It is also remarked, that wherever the arteries are more numerous, as in the muscles, the skin, the mucous surfaces, &c. the living principle is much more active in those organs ; on the con- trary, in such as are little vascular, as the tendons, cartilages, bones, and other white parts, these phe- nomena are less powerful and more obscure. In the ramifications, the curvatures are much more distinct than in the branches they are made

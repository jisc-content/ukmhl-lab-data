CELLULAR SYSTEM. 69 in like manner, that three or four days macera- tion would suffice to reduce them to a state of putrescency. The same observation applies with equal force to ebullition—a few moments would detroy and reduce most of the white tissues to jelly, if they were disposed in layers as fine as the cellular system—this however resists much longer; several plates may still be seen between the fibres of the boiled muscle. Fat which after concoc- tion is still found in masses in the midst of the fleshy fibres, would naturally escape if the cells which contain it were not perfectly entire ; we can, besides, easily ascertain the existence of laminae in these fleshy masses. The action of boiling-water is long of effect on the cellular sheath of arteries, excretories, &c. Moreover, cellular tissue submitted to con- coction, displays the same phenomena as every other organ treated in the same manner: 1st. It remains soft, or nearly in its wonted state, until an albuminous froth covers the surface of the water in which it is immersed ; 2ndly: When this folli- cle forms, it shrinks, contracts, and is reduced to a smaller size. This contraction increases till the process of ebullition takes place, which almost immediately follows. In this state the tissue is denser and more elastic, after being extended it contracts immediately to its former state, which it did not before; 3dly. It softens by degrees while ebullition is going on, and loses its con-

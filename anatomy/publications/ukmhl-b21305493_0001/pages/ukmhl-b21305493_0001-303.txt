OF ANIMAL LIF15. 161 4thly. When the cerebral substance is agitated in water, at first it floats, as Fourcroy has stated, in the form of an emulsion, then precipitates to the bottom of the vessel. A similar emulsion may be obtained from the olfactory, from the posterior parts of the optic nerves, &c. When the anterior parts of these, in which the theca is very distinct, has, for some length of time, been soaked in water, and even commonly without this preliminary caution, a large quantity of a whitish substance, and which is evidently analo- gous to the medulla of the brain, and which colours the water in which it is received, may be forced out by pressure. In the other nerves, where the medullary substance is much less abun- dant, it can also be often expelled by pressure through the extremities of the divided filaments, particularly if they have previously been mace- rated in alkaline lees. 5thly. Boiling hardens the brain, and gives it the greyish and tarnished hue similar to that which is observed in phrenites fevers. The like phenomenon exists in the soft nerves; in the others the theca, which enclothes the medullary substance, is in too large a proportion to ascertain what takes place. It is to the property the brain possesses of coagulating, by means of caloric, that we must attribute the flocculent precipitate ob- tained in an emulsion of brain, when submitted to heat.

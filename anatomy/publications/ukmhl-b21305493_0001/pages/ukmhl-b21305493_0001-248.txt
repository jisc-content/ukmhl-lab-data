Wherever nutrition is affected^ or an accidental modification in this function takes place, the cel- lular tissue acts an important part; for this it is indebted in the process of cicatrisation, and formation of tumours, to the singular property it is endowed with of extending, dilating, and growing. If all the tumours that are formed over the muscles, tendons, cartilages, &c. be ex- amined, no expansion of the fleshy, tendinous fibres, or of the cartilaginous substance, &c. will ever be discovered ; the cellular tissue only shoots from the organ and plunges into the tumour. Thus, in order to form granulations, the fibres of bones, muscles, and of fibrous substances, divided by a solution of continuity, never extend beyond the level of the wound, as in the cellular tissue of the part. The tumours I have just mentioned have no- thing in common, as may easily be conceived, with the acute tumefactions that constitute phleg- mon, nor with those congestions that occur in the limbs where there has been violent irritation ; as in fracture, complicated laxation, whitlow, punc- ture, with a venomous instrument, congestions that in general arise around the external part, violently affected, that sometimes come on al- most instantaneously, are not in reality inflamma- /

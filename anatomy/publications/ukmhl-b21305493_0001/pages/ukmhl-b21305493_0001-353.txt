These aberrations of animal sensibility then exist entirely in the brain. It is an irregularity, a disturbance in perception. This irregularity presents phenomena very analogous with the fol- lowing. We often, (as will be seen) attribute to the skin a sensation of heat, although ca- loric is not given out from that organ in a larger quantity. We are well aware that the sensations of hunger, and that of thirst, are merely sympa- thetic, and that the causes which produce them in the natural state, do not in such instances rest in the stomach or intestines. The illusions of sight, hearing, and even of smell, are made familiar to us. Generally the irregularities of perception have not been sufficiently studied ; those of me- mory, imagination, understanding, &c. have been analysed. These have been almost forgotten. They act the chief part in sympathies of animal sensibility. Sdly. Animal contractility, when it is sympathe- tically excited, always bespeaks nervous action ; in fact, we shall find that this property cannot perform its office without the treble action of the brain, of the nerves that proceed to the muscles that move, and of the muscles themselves.

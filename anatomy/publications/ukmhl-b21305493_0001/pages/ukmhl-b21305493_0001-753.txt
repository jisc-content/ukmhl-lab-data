This dependance of heat on the state of the powers in a part, is a fact ascertained in diseases as well as in all the phenomena of health: it is as real in regard to heat as it is correct in respect to the exhalations and secretions. The greater the afflux of blood in a part affected with inflammation, the more considerable the production of caloric; the increase of that fluid in the womb, in the nose, and menstruation, the active hemorrhages of the fossae nasales, the burning sensation in the chest, and the acute he- morrhages of the lungs, &c., all proceed from the same cause, namely, from an increase of the vital powers in the part. In general, when the tone is much increased, heat increases also. This explains why, in almost every case of perspira- tion, hemorrhage, and even active secretions, ca- loric is produced in greater abundance, whilst there is no superabundance of this fluid in those sweats, hemorrhages, and secretions, denominated passive, whatever may be the quantity of fluid separated by their means from the blood. Each system is possessed of its peculiar mode of heat; less caloric is certainly produced in the hair, the nails, the epidermis, than in any other system : the white organs, as the tendons, aponeurosis, the ligaments, cartilages, &c. pro- bably furnish less than the muscles.

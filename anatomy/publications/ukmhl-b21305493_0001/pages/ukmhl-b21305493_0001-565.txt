423 OF THE RED BLOOD. elasticity is augmented, their suppleness decreased. This explains why the age of manhood is that in which aneurisms are most frequent: it may be remarked, that the density of arteries augments in the same proportion as the fleshy fibres of the heart: so that the more the power of this organ is increased, the better are the arteries capable of opposing resistance. SECTION IV. \ State of the Vascular System of the Red Blood during Old Age. In the latter years, the system of the red blood is remarkable for the following phenomena. The number of the arterial ramifications is con- siderably diminished. In proportion as the heart loses its energy, it propels less blood, and with less force. The general vibration it produced in the whole arterial tree is less sensible at its ter- mination. The minute vessels that formed the extremities gradually contract, obliterate, and are converted into as many small ligaments. This is the reason why, when the periosteum is removed from the bone, the dura-mater from the interior surface of the cranium, scarcely any blood escapes; why the skin wrinkled, and hardened as it were, exhibits no longer the rosy hue, previously ob- served, especially in youth ; why the section of

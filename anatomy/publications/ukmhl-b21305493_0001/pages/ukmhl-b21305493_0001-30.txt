ANALYSIS. XXIV Operation of the re-active Substances on the heinous Tissue—The ac- tion of air, water, caloric, acids, &c. - - 473—474 Sect. II.—Parts common to the Organization of the System of the Dark Blood.—Blood vessels - 474—475 Cellular Tissue.—Of that which unites the veins with the adjacent parts.—Of that peculiar to them - 475—476 Exhalants and Absorbents.—Experiments on veinous absorption 476—477 Nerves.—Very rare - 477—478 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Vascxdar System of the Dark Blood - 478—479 Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility.—Very striking.—However, ruptures in veins sometimes occur.—Divers instances.—The causes of these ruptures imperfectly known - 479—482 Contractility.—Of this property, both in the longitudinal and transverse directions - 482—483 Sect. II.— Vital Properties.—Properties of Animal Life.—The result of experiments on sensibility.—Contractility not existing - 483—485 Properties of Organic Life. Sensible Contractility.—Rather ob- scure.—General Remarks - 485—487 Of the Veinous Pulse.—Of the cause.—It is a reflux.—Two-fold cause by which it is produced - 487—490 Insensible Contractility.—Apparently real.—Vital activity greater in veins than in arteries.—Consequences - - 490—492 Remarks on the Motion of the Dark Blood in the Veins.—Pulsation of veins not analogous to that of arteries.—The impulsive agent of the veinous circulation.—Causes of delay in the circulation.—Addi- tional causes for motion.—Resemblance between the motion of the veins, and that of the arteries - 493—499 Sympathies of the Veins.—Very obscure - - 499—500 ARTICLE IV. Developement of the Vascular System of the Dark Blood. Sect. I.—State of this System in the Foetus.—Veins are proportionally less developed than the arteries.—The reason.—Remarks - 500—503

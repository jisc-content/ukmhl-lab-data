678 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. water in its usual state or after being congealed* in lead either in a solid or fluid state, &c. &c. Now since it is by separate particles that the nutritive substances are absorbed, then in the absorbant function no distinction between the fluid and the solid exists. Since the origin of the absorbents is concealed from sight, it is difficult, nay even impossible, to determine how they arise, to ascertain the struc- ture by which they are distinguished. In their origin, in their communications, &c., they must certainly differ essentially in the mucous, cutaneous, serous, synovial, cellular, and medullary surfaces, to which they belong: the nutritive exhalants also must differ materially from the others; but nothing can be elucidated by inspection. What has not been said in respect to the intestinal villi considered as the origin of the lacteals, to their swellings, the pores of the peritoneum, of the plurse, &c, the spongy nature of the cellular membrane ? I shall pass over these anatomical hypotheses, in which the microscope has been condemned, and which besides, admitting even that they rested on some solid foundations, could lead to no inference useful to the science. Do the absorbents arise from the capillary system ? Injection seems to prove it, as several reputed anatomists, by injecting the arteries with very liquid fluids, have filled the adjacent absor- bents. I have never observed any thing of the

559 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. that a greater quantity of blood is admitted into the glandular system. Whenever this increased secretion proceeds from a deficiency of vital energy, there is not a greater quantity of blood in the gland. The same observation applies to exhalation. Thus, in the case above stated, in fever, &c., more blood is conveyed to the skin; but when perspiration proceeds from weakness, as in phthisis for instance, &c., there is an accumu- lation of blood in the capillary system. This, however, claims a further explanation. Different Proportions of Blood in the Capillary Vessels from the Active or Passive State of the Secretions and Exhalations. By active exhalations and secretions, I mean those which are preceded by, and attended with a remarkable degree of vital power: passive ex- halations and secretions are such as display a reverse phenomenon. However slightly the phe- nomena of the animal economy be examined, this distinction, which appears to me of the utmost importance in diseases, will be easily felt. Now let the organ in which it is studied be where it may, every active secretion or exhalation is always preceded by a more abundant determination of blood to the part; every passive exhalation and

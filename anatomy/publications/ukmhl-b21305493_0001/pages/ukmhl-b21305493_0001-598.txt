456 VASCULAR SYSTEM oblique direction, the less will gravity cause it to deviate ; here the influence is still lessj. If the blood were propelled in empty veins, gravity might in some degree affect its motion in the arteries ; but in the sudden shock conveyed tc the whole mass of fluid with which they are filled, the effect of which shock is instantly expe- rienced, both in the most distant parts as well as in the origin, it is evident the effect must be null. By the opposite reason, we conceive why it is so effectual in the veins, where there exists no impul- sive agent, in which the parieties only, in common with the capillary system, are the sources of motion, and in which, consequently, motion must be slowly performed, &c. From these considerations it is easy to conceive why arteries and veins display such difference in their branches, with regard to anastomosis, which is as uncommon on the one side as it is frequent on the other. section in. Termination of the Veins. The veins terminate by two principal trunks, the venae cavae, superior and inferior ; a third might also be added, namely, the coronary vein, which is continued separately to the right auricle ;

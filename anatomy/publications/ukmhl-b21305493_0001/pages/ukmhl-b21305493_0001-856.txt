ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 714 analogy between the absorbents and the veins? I cannot tell. Let this be as it may, they may be very considerable in the remote absorbents. 3rd. Whenever the thoracic duct has been tied, it not only swells, but the lymphatic vessels of the abdomen also become dilated; and this ligature is the best means of obtaining a proper investiga- tion of the lacteals. This extension has, no doubt, its limits : if too great, it would probably, in the natural state, occasion the laceration of the vessel, which is the case in injecting. In respect to these lacerations, we have hitherto obtained no information, supported by inspection or experience, although many authors have pre- tended to explain by this the cause of the greatest part of dropsies. The contractility of the tissue is evident in the system we are now considering. 1st. When the thoracic duct is distended, even in the dead body,, (the subject being recently deceased,) and the fluid has been discharged by puncture, the organ instantly contracts. 2nd. Every absorbent also contracts the moment it becomes empty. This phenomenon is particularly striking during the absorption of chyle ; as soon as it is completed, these vessels gradually disappear, in consequence of this contraction. 3rd. Absorbant glands con- siderably distended at the moment the chyle en- ters, are subsequently much reduced in size by con- traction.

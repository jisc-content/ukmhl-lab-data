ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 730 thus, again, the power of attraction existed be- fore the motion of planets could be effected, &c. SECTION II. Varieties of Absorption. From what I have just stated, it follows that whenever the organic sensibility of the absorbents is at all changed, absorption is necessarily affected, which in fact is constantly the case. In dropsies, the orifices of the absorbents are immersed in serum, their sensibility being sufficiently ex- cited to take up this fluid, but let any cause what- ever increase this property, and absorption in- stantly takes place. Some indolent tumours remain in the same state for a long time by the stagnation of their fluids, and then disap- pear if peculiar medicaments applied to them hap- pen to rouse their absorbents from their torpid state. It is not then on the fluids the resolvents act; they do not dilute them, they do not sepa- rate them, according to the vague expression of physicians, but by altering the mode of power in the absorbents they render them fit to act. It is so perfectly true, that resolution of parts takes place in this manner, that frequently a slight de- gree of inflammation is first requisite for its pro- duction,â€”every surgeon is aware of this. Desault did not consider the greatest part of obstructions in the testices as an obstacle to the operation of hydrocele by injection ; on the contrary, fre- quently after the irritation produced in the tes-

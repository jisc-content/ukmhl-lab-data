ABSGRBANT SYSTEM. T36 slow in another, regular in a third, irregular in a fourth, &c. Hence we ought not to wonder if particular absorbents only are dilated, whilst the adjacent ones are hardly perceptible. There is actually a kind of variety in veins ; but its source is within the origin of these organs, and is never observed in their course, which is the case with the absorbents. The continuity of the veinous blood, and the frequent interruptions in the circulation of lymph, must produce distinctions not only between the motions in each order of these tubes, but also in the composition of their respective fluids. The former is necessarily the same throughout; the latter may vary between each gland, and assume new modifications in everyone that it crosses. I should feel rather inclined to believe that the insensible contraction of which every minute ca- pillary system is susceptible in every gland, ac- commodates the motion of the lymph, by reducing the distance which this fluid would have to pass without a fresh impulse from the origin of the absorbents, till it reaches the dark blood, if these organs were wanting. In fact, it has been suffi- ciently ascertained, that in the extremities where â€¢ they are more sparingly disseminated, infiltra- tions more frequently take place than in the trunk incessantly overrun with absorbents; I mean those infiltrations which must evidently be refer- red to a want of circulation of lymph ; such as

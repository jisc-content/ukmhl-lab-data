492 VASCULAR SYSTEM that the obliteration of the artery is not owing to inflammation. Whilst the ligature stops the current of blood, that portion of the artery which is included between this and the first collateral branch, is gradually obliterated by the contrac- tion of the tissue, forming a kind of ligament that stops the hemorrhage, when the ligature has separated from the vessel. I very much doubt if these cases are not more frequent than those pro- duced by inflammation. Now the veins soon adhere after the ligature is applied, and when wounded they cicatrize almost immediately. In consider- able wounds the ligature is, in the first place, as I have already stated, nearly always unnecessary, on account of the valves, and even afterwards, because the divided ends contract. Whenever hemorrhage proceeds from a vein it takes place immediately, and not after such a considerable interval as is observed in respect to arteries. Every thing then concurs to prove, that in re- spect to the tonic powers, vital activity is much more considerable in the veinous than in the ar- terial system. The absence of cellular tissue, and its existence in the latter, are sufficient to ac- count for this phenomenon.

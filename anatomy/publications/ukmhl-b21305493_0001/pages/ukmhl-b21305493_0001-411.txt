269 OF ORGANIC LIFE. in this respect inferior to the cerebral nerves. This excessive tenuity proceeds from all the fila- ments being insulated instead of being united into cords, as in the preceding. This is also the reason that the nerves are so numerous. If all the filaments of the brachial plexus were separated in the same manner as those of the solar plexus seem to be, they would present the same aspect, and be equally numerous. Do the primitive plexuses formed by ganglions take an active part in nervous functions?—are they so many centres to which important pheno- mena must be referred ? What has not been said on this subject respecting the solar plexus?—but nothing, I believe, of what has been advanced on this point, is founded upon strict observation. The plexuses of organic life soon separate into different divisions, which proceed to various parts, particularly to those of the same life. These di- visions result from innumerable filaments always found in an insulated state, although close to each other, and which, like the preceding, never unite to form a cord; they accompany almost every artery: thus the renal, the hepatick, splenic, coronary, stomachic, mesenteric, hypogastric, the carotid, and its distributions, &c. are attended with filaments proceeding from the ganglions. These filaments are disposed in two different ways. 1st. Some attend the artery without adhering to it, being separated by a great quantity of cellular

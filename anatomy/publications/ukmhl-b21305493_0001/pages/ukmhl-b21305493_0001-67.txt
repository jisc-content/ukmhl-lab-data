GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XXVii others, to prove more fully the difference existing between the physical and vital laws, as also that found between physical and vital phenomena, which arise from the former ; and, finally, the difference of the general character and methods of the physical and physiological sciences, which are consequential to the two others. I might shew how inert bodies form themselves by chance, by the juxta-position or combination of their in- tegral particles; how bodies, on the contrary, are propagated by a determinate function, namely, generation : how the former grow in the same way as they have been formed, by juxta-position or the combination of new particles; and how the latter, by an internal process of assimilation, which re- quires some preparatory functions: that the latter are as long as they exist the habitual seat of com- position and of decomposition; that the former always remain in the same state, and are subject to no other modifications but those influenced by physical laws or those occasioned by chance; that the former finish their existence as they commenced it, by the operation of mechanical laws, friction, contact, or new combinations; that the latter afford as certain a phenomenon in their natural destruction as in their production ; that the latter proceed immediately to a new state when life has forsaken them, undergo putrefaction, desiccation, &c. from which they were previously preserved, because, fettered by vital properties, the physical

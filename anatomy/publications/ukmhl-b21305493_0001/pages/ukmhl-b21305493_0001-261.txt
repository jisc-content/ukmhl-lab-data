119 CELLULAR SYSTEM. terstices become narrower. If there is not an actual diminution, at least there is one in respect to the state of the organs. To this circumstance must we attribute the projection of these beneath the integuments, the power of muscular forms, &e. It seems, however, that the quantity of the cellular membrane varies according to the temperament; that in those which are denominated phlegmatic or lymphatic, it is more abundant than in the other systems ; that on the contrary, in such sub- jects as are called bilious, which characterises (as is said) the dry and rigid, it is in a smaller pro- portion. In the female it seems to be in a larger quantity than in the male ; the delicacy of form is in the fair sex partly the result of its predo- minance. The motion of one part does not seem to produce a more active nutrition in its cellular texture, as is the case in respect to muscles, to nerves, and even sometimes to blood vessels. In old age this tissue condenses and contracts; it acquires a considerable consistency and hard- ness, and the tooth tears it with difficulty in the boiled meat of old animals. In these it is tough, and requires a very long ebullition to dissolve it: much less fluid is exhaled within it; on which account there is a kind of stiffness and rigidity which renders the motions of old age rather diffi- cult. This kind of decay is particularly con- nected with the general disunion which the body

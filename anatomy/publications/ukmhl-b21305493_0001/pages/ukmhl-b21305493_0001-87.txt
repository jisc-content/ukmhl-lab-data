xlvii general considerations. determined it, nor does it soften the substance in the same slow and gradual manner it has harden- ed it: what remains is permanently contracted and twisted. Are these two kinds of contraction different degrees, or do they proceed from distinct prin- ciples ? I do not know : this at least is certain, that when living solids have undergone the slow and insensible contraction, they are still susceptible of the other. It is well known, that animal texture after undergoing several years of desiccation, con- tracts the same as if it had just been submitted to the action of fire in a recent state ; the same may be said of ebullition and acids. Soft parts that have been macerated some time in alkohol and neutral salts, exhibit the same effect. All animal tissues are susceptible of sudden con- traction, excepting the hair, epidermis and nails, which in some measure have only the rudiments of this faculty. The contractile power is generally more or less sensible in organs accord- ing to their fibrous texture. This explains why muscles, tendons, nerves, &c. are most susceptible thereof; organs that have no fibres, as glands, &c. possess it in a minor degree. Slow and progressive contraction is nearly every where the same. Both exist in textures destitute of animal contractility, sensible organic contractility, and contractility of tissue, as well as in those which enjoy them in the highest degree. Thus VOL. I E

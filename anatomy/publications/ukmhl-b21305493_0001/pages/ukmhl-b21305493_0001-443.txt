OF THE RED BLOOD. 301 Course of the Trunks and Branches. * The trunks are the first divisions, continuous with the two great portions of the aorta, as the external and internal carotid, the subclavian, &c. above; the iliac, hypogastric, &c. below. They are generally situate in large cavities, filled with cellular substance, as the groin, arrn-pit, neck, the sides of the pelvis, &c. On -dividing they form branches that are received into less spaces, and which are consequently less exposed to the influence of the neighbouring organs: both have sufficient covering to protect them from external injuries; besides, the shelter which they receive from the adjacent parts, and particularly the muscles, the circulation of the blood is also acce- lerated by the action of these organs, whilst the motion of the arterial trunks reciprocally com- municate a shock to the neighbouring organs, and even to the whole of the extremity, that as- sists in maintaining its vital energy. This shock, which is often difficult to be observed, is some- times readily discovered by the slightest inspec- tion. If we support the elbow upon a table, and hold in the hand a body of a certain length, its extremity is seen to rise and fall in some degree at each pulsation. If we cross the legs previously bent upon the thighs, a spontaneous throb is observed in that which is uppermost. To this cause may be referred the motion of the brain.

666 EXHALANT SYSTEM. ganic sensibility or tone, may be used to advan- tage in respect to the former, whilst it would be ineffectual in regard to the latter. I shall now proceed to the sanguineous exhalations which are performed by the recrementitious exhalants. Hemorrhages of the Recrementitious Exhalants. i The serous membranes are frequently the seat of hemorrhages : dissection proves it in the most positive manner. Nothing is more common than to find the peritoneum, the pleura, the pericar- dium, imbued with a serum of a reddish hue if little blood has been effused, very deep if more has been exhaled ; and even, in some instances, % with pure blood. I have made this remark in two different cases. 1st. Subsequent to inflammations, either acute or chronic, especially to the latter. The serous membrane contains, then, more or less blood; sometimes without any intermixture, most fre- quently mixed with serum, and occasionally even with whitish and albuminous flakes. The pre- ceding inflammation seems to ramk these hemor- rhages amongst those of an active nature. 2dly. On the decline of organic diseases, when the exhalations of serum increase almost con- stantly in the serous membrane, even to such a degree as to produce dropsies evidently passive, more or less blood is frequently mixed with this

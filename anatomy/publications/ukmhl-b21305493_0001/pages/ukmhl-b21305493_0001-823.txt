ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 681 deep, found on the internal surface of the parieties of cavities : for instance, in the abdomen, between its parieties and the peritoneum ; in the chest, be- tween its parieties and the pleura; the first di- vision especially proceeds from the fleshy parie- ties, and the abundant cellular tissue adjoining : the second belongs both to these parieties, and to the serous surfaces with which they are lined. Besides these aborbents, all the viscera contained in the preceding cavities are also pro- vided with some, both deep and superficial: the former even in the very interior of the organ : the latter are seen over its surface. This distinc- tion is easily made in the liver, in the spleen, &c.; the external absorbents of the trunk run a tole- rable distance without meeting with any glands. Those that twine over the internal surfaces of these parieties are similarly disposed; but such as proceed from the viscera, on their egress, meet with these glands, and cross them several times because they are situate close together. 3dly. Many absorbents are found on the exter- nal part of the cranium ; but anatomists have not yet succeeded in finding any within its cavity, which, perhaps, agrees, as I have before stated, with the almost total absence of cellular tissue in this cavity ; many are found in the face, either superficially or in the muscular interstices, and round the organs situate in that region; they proceed to the neck, and meet in their course a vol. i. . 3 E

OF TME DARK BLOOD. 437 veins, it is evident that, considered as a whole, they are much more capacious than the arteries. This assertion will be easily verified by examining them individually, in parts that are conjoined, as in the loins, the spleen, in the limbs, &c.: even in those parts where the veins are separated from the arteries, as in the brain, the liver, &c. l/efr this is not striking. Finally, there is also, as I have just said, a sub-cutaneous division of veins, which is evidently greater than the arteries. Several physiologists have attempted to calcu- late the degree of capacity between the veinous and arterial systems ; but this is evidently too va- riable to be ever established. In fact, to make the dead body the subject of this experiment would be useless ; for, according to the manner in which death has been occasioned, the veins will be found more or less dilated. In apoplexy, asphyxia, submersion, &c. the diameter of these vessels is double, compared with what they present when the subject has died from hemorrhage, because, in the former mode of death, a great quantity of blood is accumulated in the veins, and in the latter they are drained of this fluid. We can pro- duce a greater or less capacity in the veins of an animal, according to the method employed for its destruction, and for the same reason we can increase or diminish at will the right cavities of the heart, by making use of the same means. I deny that the veins can ever be found exactly

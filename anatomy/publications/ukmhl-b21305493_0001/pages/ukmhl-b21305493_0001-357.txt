OF ANIMAL LIFE. 215 nected with the nervous influence of animal life; I might make the same remark in respect to vas- cular cellular influences, &c. We cannot cer- tainly ground an opinion upon any solid basis, to explain in what manner these means of commu- nication can cause perspiration when the lungs â€™are affected, or salivation when the palatine mem- brane is irritated, &c. From all that has been hitherto advanced, it follows: 1st, That the sympathies of animal sen- sibility would seem, in most instances, to be aber- rations of the principle which perceives in us, and which then mistakes the part in which the causes of sensations are operating. 2dly. That the sym- pathies of animal contractility unavoidably re- quire the interference of the brain ; but that we are ignorant by what means the part affected acts upon that viscus, although we are perfectly aware how that viscus, when sympathetically ex- cited, re-acts upon the muscles to make them contract. 3dly. That the causes of the two kinds of organic sympathies are completely unknown, and that a dark veil still conceals from us the agents of communication, which in this case con- nect the organs from whence the sympathetic in- fluence is conveyed to the part which receives it. It is this obscurity of the causes of sympathies, which (in classifying sympathies in this work, in which I examine them in each system of the or- gans,) has induced me entirely to neglect all hypo-

636 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. SECTION IV. Remarks on the State of the Lungs in the Dead Body. I shall confine myself here solely to a remark, already stated in the book alluded to, namely, the very frequent obstructions to which the lungs are liable at the moment of death. This organ alone receiving the blood of the whole body, from the moment the powers sink this fluid stag- nates and is accumulated ; so that, according to the state of the powers at the time of death, let the disease be what it may, it will vary in weight, and be more or less filled with fluids, so that it will scarcely ever be seen twice in the same state. Such obstructions are constantly found when death has been attended with agony.

This organization can only be properly seen in subjects that have died subsequent to hemorrhage or in syn- copv; in the greatest part of the others it is im- possible to distinguish any thingâ€™. This undoubt- edly explains why we are still so imperfectly ac-

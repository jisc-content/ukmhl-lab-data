CELLULAR SYSTEM. 96 pie, they make their appearance within four or five days, whereas, in bones they occur at a much later period of time ; but their texture, external appearance, and nature, are always the same ; consequently, they are the growth and expansion of an organ common to all other parts ; and ac- cordingly, this organ, common to all other parts, and the universal basis of our living fabric, is the cellular tissue. The reddish colour of granulations has led to an opinion that they were produced by enlarged blood vessels, but their developement is entirely independent of the vascular system. The follow- ing explanation is illustrative of my dissent from such an opinion : We have already seen that the cellular tissue is fraught with exhalants and absor- bents, so that it appears almost entirely formed of them. We shall find then on further investiga- tion, that in inflammation red blood is perpetually forcing itself into these species of vessels, and that as granulations are formed of and by cellular sub- stance, they consequently partake of the nature of that system ; on the other hand, being constantly in a state of inflammation we can easily con- ceive that the redness of granulations is like that of an inflamed pleura of the cellular tissue in a state of phlegmon, or the skin affected by ery- sipelas. Nevertheless, it does not imply any elongation of vessels carrying blood, but sim- ply the propulsion of blood into those that

After the first months of conception things begin to change. The quantity of blood con- veyed through the pulmonary artery was at first very trifling, because such was the dilatation of the arterial canal, that it directed nearly the whole into the aorta descendens. This canal gradually contracting, the pulmonary arteries dilate, and then a larger quantity of blood tra- verses the lungs to be returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle, that transmits it in the ventricle of the same side, by which it is propelled into the arch of the aorta; then the mechanical action of the circulation here above stated begins

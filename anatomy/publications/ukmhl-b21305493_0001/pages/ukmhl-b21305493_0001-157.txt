15 CfiLLULAK SYSTEM. structure uninjured, besides a thousand other facts of the same kindâ€”these are phenomena that the dead body exhibits constantly. Need I call to mind the various tumours that are developed in the very heart of the vital or- gans without impairing them, the numberless excrescences that vegetate beside them without their partaking in them? Let us for a moment dissect a muscle beneath a frightful suppurating , wound in the skin, we shall not find, at least in the majority of cases, any change in its structure or appearance, the skin alone is diseased. Un- doubtedly the difference of vitality between two adjacent organs, is the substantial cause of the distinct nature of diseases, but the cellular atmos- phere that defends them, is another and not less so. Thus, whenever one organ sends processes or parts of its own structure to another, it com- municates its diseases much more readily than if it were separated from it by a thick cellular covering: for instance, the affections of the pe- riosteum and of the bone are soon blended to- gether, as we well know. We must not, however, carry this idea too far, in considering the cellular atmosphere as it has been called, as an insurmountable barrier to dis- eases. Practice would often greviously belie it, in shewing diseases passing from an organ to the surrounding tissue, and from that tissue to the neighbouring organ; so that sometimes we find it

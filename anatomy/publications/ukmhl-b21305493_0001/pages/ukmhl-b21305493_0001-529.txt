OF THE RED BLOOD. 387 1st. Contraction of the ventricle, a slight dilata- tion in the arterial system caused by the propelled fluid, general locomotion, passage of part of the veinous blood into the capillary system ; all these phenomena are produced in the very same in- stant ; it is at the time of the diastole that the pulse strikes the finger. 2dly. In the succeeding interval the ventricle expands to be re-filled, being less replete with blood; arteries, in some degree relax ; they all return to the different parts from which they had been previously raised. This state, which happens during the systole, is in respect to the arteries purely passive, whilst the contrary opinion has been held. As very little blood is propelled at each pulsation from the ventricle, which is never completely emptied, and that on the other hand, at the very moment a quantity of this fluid enters the arteries, some is expelled from the part opposite to the heart, the arterial dilatation, and consequently the contraction, are very trifling; thus they can never be perceived. Besides, the contraction, if really present, would not be perceptible, because, when the contractility of the texture acts, it produces a slow, gradual and insensible motion, a real shrink- ing ; whilst contraction produced by irritability is abruptly and instantaneously performed, and pro- duces a motion striking to the eye. I cannot insist too much upon this positive fact, namely, that if arteries are in some degree con-

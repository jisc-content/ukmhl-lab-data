619 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. sensation is referred continues in its natural state, and lias produced neither more nor less caloric. It is, in short, the same thing as when we figure to ourselves that we experience pain in the am- putated limb. This is an aberration of percep- tion, a real sympathy of animal sensibility, whilst the former is a sympathy of organic insensible contractility, or tone. It is this last property that is affected : the production of caloric is only con- secutive, it is continued as usual, as well as per- ception that indicates its existence. A strange hand applied to the part will feel nothing new in the first case, which I shall explain more fully in the following systems: in this, it experiences a warmer sensation. In the same manner, if the sym- pathetic influence be calculated to reduce the tonic powers, less heat is disengaged in the part, which is sensible to the individual himself, or to . any other that applies the hand to the part. Dis- eases incessantly display these phenomena rela- tive to heat, and which cannot be explained by any other theory. In this theory, however, as well as in any other, there exists a phenomenon not perfectly understood ; namely, the faculty that animals are endowed with, of resisting external heat. Every inert body has a temperature similar to that wherein it is placed. Every organized body, on the contrary, repels caloric that in higher tem- peratures is disposed to penetrate it. This de- 3 a 2

XXX11 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. confirmed. Besides, in all the phenomena of the living economy the fluids are observed to be nearly in a passive state. The solids on the contrary are always highly active. It is the solids which receive excitement, and which re-act in virtue of that excitement. The fluids are every where excitants, and excitants only. The continual action of the latter on the former gives rise in every part to perpetual sensations which are not referred to the brain, and conse- quently not perceived. This is organic sensibility in motion; it differs in this respect from animal sensibility, that the soul is not conscious of sen- sations which do not extend beyond the organs where they take place. As therefore on one hand, the vital properties reside essentially in the solids, and on the other, morbid phenomena are merely changes of these properties, it is evident that such phenomena essentially reside in the solids, and that fluids are in a certain degree uninfluenced by them. All va- rieties of pain, and spasm, all these irregular moâ€™ tions of the heart, which constitute the number- less and different states of pulse, have their princi- ples in the solids. Let us not think, however, that fluids have no concern with diseases; they frequently contain their seeds and germ ; they fill the same part as in the state of health, where the solids are the active agents of all the phenomena we observe,

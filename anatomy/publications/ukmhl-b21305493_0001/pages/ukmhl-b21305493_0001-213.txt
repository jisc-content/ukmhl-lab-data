CELLULAR SYSTEM. 71 the latter, and are scarcely changed while they are reduced to chyme. Fat, which is generally deposited in these cellular lumps, might have tended to the production of this phenomenon ; 3dly. 1 have made the same observation upon dogs, that I have opened during the different stages of digestion, with the view of ascertaining the various states of the bile in the cystic and he- patic ducts, which I have already explained in part. How does it happen then, that the exces- sive softness and delicacy which characterises the cellular tissue is united with a stronger power in proportion of resisting the different chemical reagents than is found in other tissues of a closer texture ? It is well known that, in drowned persons, a considerable quantity of gas disengaged from certain parts of the body, and particularly vas- cular parts, as the muscles, glands, &c. distends the cellular tissue, renders it emphysematous, and causes the body to float on the water, &c. This phenomenon does not so frequently occur in open air, where putrefaction takes place so ra- pidly, with blackness and disorganization of parts. The tendons, fascia, cartilages, bones, &c. of animals drowned, in experiments have never appeared to me to assist in the production of this gas. The cellular tissue itself has, I think, less share therein than any of the above-mentioned organs. It would not, however, be difficult to

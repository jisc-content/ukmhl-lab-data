VASCULAR SYSTEM 378 merely a kind of oscillation or insensible vibration of the vascular parieties. It is even this by which the two species of organic contractility are essen- tially distinguished. The one only acts on fluids contained in large quantities, as on the blood, food, wine, &c.; the other impresses the motion to fluids divided in minute streams; it presides over capillary circulation, exhalation, and secre- tion. The influence of the first is then, parti- cularly intended for large cavities, such as the stomach, the * bladder, the intestines. That of the second exists in the capillary tubes only. As long as the blood remains together in a tolerable mass, it must necessarily be impelled by the heart, since the arteries being deprived of irritability are not calculated to perform that office. When it is in very minute threads it is then circulated by the insensible contractility of the vessels. This then is the part which the latter property takes in the svstem of the red blood. 1st. It ex- ists in the trunks, branches, and the ramifications, but is useless as long as the influence of the heart is sustained. 2dly. This last influence gradually decreasing as it reaches the vessels of a lower de- scription, the other begins to be more active. 3dly, and finally. The heart having ceased to agi- tate the blood in the general capillary system, insensible organic contractility or tone is the only remaining cause of motion.

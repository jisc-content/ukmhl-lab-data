138 NERVOUS SYSTEM nerves for sensation and others for motion, and that if these nerves do not answer this double pur- pose, the difference is in the filaments and not in the cords. In the interior of the vertebral canal, where the nervous cords, from the deficiency of cellular membrane are very much asunder—the filaments of which they are composed do not communicate with each other in this manner:—here, as with- out, there is no interior plexus of the nerve. This remark is particularly applicable to the extremity of the canal, where, as I have said, the nerves run to a considerable extent. The communication of nerves on issuing from their bony cavities is so very general, that it may be said they form on each side a kind of organ continuous throughout; an organ, to the for- mation of which, the optic, the olfactory, and the auditory nerves only, do not contribute. These kinds of communications, however, all of which are formed by juxta-position, seem to have no great influence on the functions of nerves. Each of their cords, although belonging in their course to several different trunks, can very well fulfil their functions in an insulated manner, which may also be said of every filament, although con- curring in their process to form several cords of the same nerve. I must observe in this respect, that it is requi- site carefully to distinguish these communications

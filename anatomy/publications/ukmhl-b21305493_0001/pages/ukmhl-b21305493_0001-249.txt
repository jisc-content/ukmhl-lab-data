CELLULAR SYSTEM. 107 tory, although there is tension, pain, &c. and which better deserve the term of inflation than than of congestion. Neither should these tumours be confounded with certain chronic congestions, in which the cellular tissue, without growing or increasing in the least, is infiltrated and impregnated with di- vers substances that alter its nature; such are those that occur in the diseases of the articula- tions, the callosities of fistulas, &c., the greasy matter found in certain tumours, &c. In all these cases there is no addition or growth, as in a poly- pus, a fungus, &c. It is a substance more solid than serum, infiltrating the cellular tissue, and forcing its laminee, so as to give the whole mass an homogeneous appearance. Besides, there is at the instant of death, a re- markable difference between an acute and chronic tumour, whether this last is produced by a growth of the part, or by infiltration : in fact, it remains the same, and retains, like every other organ, its volume, form and density, until dissolved by pu- trefaction. The first, on the contrary, as I have observed, subsides with the decay of the vital powers: this varies. If the tumour is nothing more than the cellular distention I have just men- tioned, and which is so frequent in external inju- ries, it totally disappears; if, besides this swelling, there is an accumulation of blood, as in carbuncle, phlegmon, &c. a portion of the tumour remains, p 2

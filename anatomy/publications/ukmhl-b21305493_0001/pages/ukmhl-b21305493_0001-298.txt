156 NERVOUS SYSTEM very diminutive nerve will support a greater weight than the spinal marrow. I believe that amongst the textures that are disposed in fila- ments or in extended tubes, this and the arterial, after the fibrous, present the greatest resistance : they surpass the veinous, the muscular, the se- rous, &c. The Medullary Substance : its Origin. This substance occupies the interior of the theca, or nevrileme, in the same manner as the substance of the spinal marrow fills the canal that is formed for it by the pia-mater. This medul- lary substance is of a whitish hue, as that of the brain and of the spinal marrow ; it is from this that nerves borrow their colour. In the optic nerve it exists in a greater degree than in all the rest. It is exclusively met with in that part of the nerve which is posterior to its union with its fellow, which is also the case in the olfactory. In the auditory nerve, which appears to be princi- pally formed by it, it is also found very abundant. In general, I believe, that at the origin, in the bony cavities, it is in greater quantity than the theca, whilst in the course of the nerve it is quite the reverse. From this proceeds the great resistance which nerves, considered in the second instance, display, when compared with the same in the first. This substance seems to be continuous with the

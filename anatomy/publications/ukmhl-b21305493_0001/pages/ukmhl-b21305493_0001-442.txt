VASCULAR SYSTEM 300 they belong. Their general distribution is not uniform like that of the nerves of animal life. Even those of the corresponding limbs frequently differ in their mode of origin, and in the course of their branches. The branches, ramifications, &c. arise at very short distances from each other. There are only the carotid and the common iliac, that run to some distance without furnishing any. Those experiments also in which it is necessary to pass tubes into the arteries, to open them, &c. are almost impracticable, except with the former: the others are objectionable on account of the branches that arise from them, which prevent them from being elevated to a sufficient extent. The origin of the arterial trunks and ramifi- cations does not take place in a regular and pro- gressive manner. Thus, the smaller branches, and even the ramifications, arise equally from trunks and from branches; the brachial arteries for instance, and those of the thymus gland, arise from the aorta, and yet they are not so large as the greater part of the divisions of the tibial, which is itself only a third division of the aorta. Course of the Arteries. The course of the arteries differs accordingly as these are trunks, branches, and their divisions, or ramusculi.

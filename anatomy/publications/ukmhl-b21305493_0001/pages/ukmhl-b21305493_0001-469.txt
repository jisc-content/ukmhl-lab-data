327 OF THE RED BLOOD. still very resistant. By removing' carefully the putrid substances, they may be traced even to their very last ramifications. This mode of ex- amining arteries, either filled by injections, or when empty, is not difficult. In the living sub- ject, these vessels resist putrefaction much longer than the skin, the cellular texture, &c. An artery is often seen to traverse a putrefied part without experiencing the least injury. Frequent instances of this are seen in gun-shot wounds. After a lapse of time, which varies considera- bly according to the degree of temperature, the arterial texture ultimately yields to macera- tion and putrefaction. In the first instance, it softens by degrees, without any alteration of colour ; its fibres cease to adhere ; and finally, it is changed into a pulpj, which is of a greyish co- lour, and nearly homogeneous. In the second case, it first acquires a greyish hue, is then also converted into a pulp, and when the whole fluid part has evaporated, leaves a residue perfectly different from that produced by the putrefaction of muscles. In general, the arterial texture requires a much longer time to be re- duced by maceration than by putrefaction . This proves the superiority of the action of air over that of water, in the production of this phenomenon. When submitted to the contact of caloric, the arterial texture becomes crisped, contracted, and shrunk to the last degree. Whenever the

EXHALANT SYSTEM. Exhalation and secretion are two similar functions in this respect, that both separate from the blood liquids distinct from this fluid, and pour them over various surfaces, where they are in- tended for different purposes. Their distinctions are as follows: 1st. In exhalation there is no organ interme- diate to the arteries and exhaling vessels; they are only separated by a capillary plexus, whilst, on the contrary, an intermediate organ is always found between the excretory vessels and the arteries. ^This organ is the capillary system ; from their minute tubes the former arise, and the latter terminate. 2dly. The organized mechanism that elaborates the secreted fluids, is then much more compli-

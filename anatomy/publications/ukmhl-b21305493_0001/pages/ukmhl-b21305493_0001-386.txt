244 NERVOUS SYSTEM communications no more prove the existence of such a general nerve, than the branches that proceed from the cervical pairs, the lombar, or the sacral, to those which are either superior or inferior to them. In fact, notwithstanding these communications, we consider each pair in an insulated manner, we do not form a single nerve from the whole; in the same manner, every ganglion must be considered separately, notwith- standing the branches that proceed from it to others. The description of the system of ganglions should be analogous to that of the cerebral nerves. For instance, I first describe the lenticular gan- glion, in the same manner as we describe the brain; then, I examine its branches, amongst which is the great splanchnic ; for that expression, which describes this nerve as giving birth to the gan- glion, is very incorrect. In the neck, the head, &c. every ganglion also is first described; then its branches, amongst which are such as communi- cate. There are consequently almost as many de- scriptions as there are separate ganglions: we ought not, for instance, to treat of the ophthal- mic nerve together with the general motores ; to be convinced of this, it is only requisite to consider how much the ciliary nerves differ from the others, which, belonging to animal life, are also contained in the orbit. In consequence of what has just been said, it is

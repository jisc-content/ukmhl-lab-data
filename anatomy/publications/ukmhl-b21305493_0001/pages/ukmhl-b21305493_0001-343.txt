From all that has been stated, it is evident, that all phenomena, over which preside what are com- monly termed the tonic forces, namely, organic sensibility and insensible contractility, are actually independent of the nervous action; that conse- quently, these properties would not be proper, like those of animal life, to force this action. Every kind of sensibility has its morbid pheno- mena, over which it presides. Inflammations, all kinds of suppurations, the formation of tumours, dropsies, perspirations, haemorrhages, disorders of the secretions, &c. &c. proceed from changes in organic sensibility, whilst all kinds of spasms, convulsions, palsies, somnambulism, torpor, de- rangement of the intellectual functions, &c. &c.; in a word, all that in diseases tends to interrupt our communications with surrounding bodies, must be referred to changes in animal sensibility, or contractility, and bespeak a derangement more or less decided in the nervous system. In general, the diseases which derange the functions of animal life are quite of a different nature from those which destroy the harmony of organic life; the characteristics, the progress, the phenomena, are in nothing similar. On the one hand, let us place injuries of the external senses, blindness, deafness, loss of taste, &c. ; those of VOL. I. x

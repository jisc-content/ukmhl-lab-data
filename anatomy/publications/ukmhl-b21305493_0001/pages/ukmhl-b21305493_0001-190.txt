48 CELLUJiA II SYSTEM. of it; thus, between the coats of the stomach, intes- tines, and bladder, &c. between the periosteum and bone, between the latter and cartilage, between muscle and tendon, &c., this substance is hardly ever to be found. It is therefore principally in the spaces of the various organs that fat accumulates. Ac- cordingly, examining it under this aspect in the different parts, we find; 1st, that the head, cranium, and face, are differently circumstanced; it is very abundant in the latter, and wanting in the former, particularly in its internal struc- ture ; 2dly, that the neck is provided with a sufficient share; 3dly, in the chest, there is very little about the lungs, but a great quantity in the neighbourhood of the heart; externally, and at its superior part it presents a mass about the mammae; 4thly, in the abdomen, this fluid is especially abundant at its posterior part in the neighbourhood of the kidneys, mesentery, and omentum ; 5thly, in the pelvis, it is accumulated largely about the bladder and the rectum ; fithly, in the extremities it is found like the cellular tissue, in greater abundance in the superior ones, and near the large joints. We observe, that in the infant the quantity of fat is found in a much larger proportion under the skin than in any other part, and particularly in the abdomen , whose cellular viscera, and especially the omentum, contain none at that age.

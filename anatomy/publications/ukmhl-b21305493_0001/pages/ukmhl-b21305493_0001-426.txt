vascular system 284 treme parts, and the apex to the heart. This method of viewing them proceeds from the cir- cumstance of the sum total of the ramifications being more considerable in diameter than the trunks from which they proceed ; but in adopting this idea, it is evident that each half of the heart is as the summit of the two cones which would otherwise be united. The pulmonary veins re- present the one, the aorta the other, for the sys- tem of the red blood. In that of the dark blood the two cones are formed, on the one hand, by the venae cavee and the coronaries, and on the other by the pulmonary artery. In each circula- tion one of these cones, namely, the pulmonic, is remarkable for its shortness; the other, or the general one, for its extent. Placed between these two cones, the sides of the heart must be considered each as an impelling agent, which forces the blood on the one hand to all the parts of the body, on the other to the lungs. In fact, if in each circulation these two cones were united at their summit, it is evident that the parieties of the vessels that compose them would be inadequate to sustain the neces- sary degree of motion from the basis of the one to that of the other; that is to say, from the ge- neral capillary system to that of the lungs, and reciprocally from the capillary system of the lungs to that of the other. Indeed, the course is

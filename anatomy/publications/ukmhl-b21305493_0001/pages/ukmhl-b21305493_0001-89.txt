xlix GKNEKAL CONSIDERATIONSt. As soon as putrescency begins, the contractile property ceases. Slow and gradual contraction, is null during life, which opposes an insuperable obstacle to it; but sudden contraction may supervene when its agents have overcome the resistance it affords,— thus the skin is frequently contracted by burns. If it be stript of its epidermis, and a concentrated acid poured upon it, it produces on these parts the same effect it would on any other organ. From the moment that a part has been con- tracted in a living subject, it almost infallibly perishes, and can never be restored to its original pliable state ; suppuration separates it from the sound parts. Fluids do not exhibit the phenomena of con- traction, the fibrine only excepted ; separated from the mass of the blood, it shrinks on ex- posure to heat. From what has been said, it is evident that solids are possessed of the faculty of contracting or shortening themselves; this faculty, too, may be excited in different ways.

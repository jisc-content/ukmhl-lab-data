243 OF OKGANIC LIFE. or it is divided into several portions. From thence the inaccuracy of all denomination drawn from the figure, a remark generally applica- ble to every organ of internal life. We might more judiciously borrow the names of forms in animal life, where the shapes are more invariable; and on the other hand, the number of several ganglions varies considerably; sometimes three are found in the neck, on other occasions only two. The disposition in one side ever commands a simi- lar one in the opposite one. I have frequently ascertained that the number of filaments proceed- ing from the superior cervical ganglion essentially differ from those which arise from the opposite side. There are actually two analogous organs in each side, but innumerable distinctions in struc- ture incessantly destroy the general character of symmetry. It is the same as in the lungs or in the loins. We might then lay down as a distinc- tive character between the two nervous systems, the regularity of the one, and the irregularity of the other; then this very characteristic, as I have already mentioned, is one of those by which the two lives are distinguished. From what has been stated, it is evident, that a marked distinction exists between the nerves proceeding from the ganglions, and those from the brain, and that it would not be correct to view them as forming one sole nerve, emanating from the latter by any origin whatever. Their

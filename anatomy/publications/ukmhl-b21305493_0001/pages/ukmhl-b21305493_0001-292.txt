NERVOUS SYSTEM 150 In respect to the origin of nerves contained in the bony cavity of the scull, those proceeding from the tuber and its appendages, that is to say, the projections it receives from the brain or the cerebellum present a disposition analogous to that in the nerves of the spine. The difference, however, in the thickness and density of the pia- mater, establishes some distinctions. In fact the pia-mater which enclothes this part is different from that which constitutes the canal containing the spinal marrow; it is much softer, less ad- herent, is lacerated with much more facility, and appears analogous to that which envelopes the cortical substance of the brain. The theca of the nerves of the tuber, which is evidently con- tinuous with that portion of the pia-mater, pre- sents in some degree this character. At their point of union it is softer than in the canal; from whence proceeds the great facility with which, ag I have observed, these nerves are torn away at their origin. The continuity with the pia- mater is further ascertained by the facility with which the nerves yield when this membrane is removed : generally speaking, they give way to- sether- ^ In respect to the cerwai nerves, the olfactory, enveloped by the pia-mater, but in a loose manner, seems deprived of this theca. In the optic nerve, from its origin to its conjunction with that of the opposite side, it is evidently want- ing. At this point it begins to be invested

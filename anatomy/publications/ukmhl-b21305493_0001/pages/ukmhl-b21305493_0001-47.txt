GENERAL CONSIDER ATI ON N. Vll motion ; or as the wheel of a mill, or any other machine, which the water forces into action as it flows, recalls to the philosopher the laws of gra- vity. To compare the two classes of sciences to- gether, it is obviously necessary to conceive an accurate idea of the vital properties : if their limits be not well marked, one cannot, with certainty, analyze their influence. I shall be satisfied with making some general considerations on this sub- ject, as I have treated it at sufficient length in my Researches on Life;—what is added here, must be considered supplementary to my observations in that work. SECTION II. Of Vital Properties, and their influence on all the Phenomena of Physiological Sciences. In assigning limits to these properties, we must follow them from bodies, scarcely organized, to the most perfect. In plants that seem to form the transition, or intermediate links between vegetables and ani- „ mals, we perceive nothing but an internal motion, which can scarcely be called real; their growth depends as much upon the affinity, and con- sequently apposition of particles, as on actual nutrition. Notwithstanding, if we examine ve- getables more perfectly organized, we shall find them teeming with fluids that circulate through them in a multitude of capillary vessels,

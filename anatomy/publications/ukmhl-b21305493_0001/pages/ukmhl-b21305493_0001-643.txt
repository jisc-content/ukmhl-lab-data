501 OF THE DARK BLOOD. siderably larger than, in fact, they are found to be in their natural state. The branches and ramifications should be se- lected for comparisons. Now, it is easy to see that, in this case, the veins are nearly equal, but not larger than the arteries, which constantly hap- pens in the adult. The side of the heart, however, which receives the dark blood, and the pulmonary artery that forms a part in the system of the veins, are pro- portionally more capacious than these ; because, not only they receive and transmit the blood of these vessels, but also that of the umbilical vein. To this last circumstance must also be attributed an anatomical fact, always applicable to the foetus, and to it only, namely, that the very short trunk of the vena cava, which is extended from the liver to the heart, is proportionally much larger than that of the vena cava superior. The slight developement of the veinous sys- tem, compared with that of the arteries, seems in respect to the foetus, to proceed from the great consumption of matter in the process of nutrition, which at first being very rapid, less substance is con- sequently returned by the veins. This phenome- non, however, is not peculiar to the veinous cir- culation ; we shall find that the excretory organs give out less fluid from the glands, and the exha- lants are less active on their respective surfaces. A considerable quantity of blood enters the general

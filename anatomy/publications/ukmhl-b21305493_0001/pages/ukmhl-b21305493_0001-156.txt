14 CELLULAK SYSTEM. or less abundance, also powerfully contribute to make their respective shares of life distinct. They form to the several organs an intermediate substance, which, in its nature as a fluid, enjoys less of the living power than themâ€”is as it were thus placed beneath their level, and has conse- quently a tendency to break, in a certain degree, the vital communications that subsist between them. The essential difference between the peculiar life of the cellular tissue and that of the other organs, enables it to perform a separate duty by itself, as a solid, and independent of the fluid it contains. To the absolute separation of life in the different organs, through the means of the sur- rounding cellular tissue, we must partly refer the absolute distinctness of diseases, or, more pro- perly, the alteration of life. Every day we see a diseased organ contiguous to a healthy one, but no derangement in the structure of the lat- ter. Do we not find the pleura sound, and the lungs beneath covered with tubercles and ulcers; the peritoneum inflamed throughout all its extent, while the intestines, stomach, liver and spleen are nevertheless in a natural state ; the mu- cous membranes affected with disease, and the bordering parts they line without a trace of it; the skin suffering under numberless eruptions, and the sub-cutaneous organs perfectly free : the tu - nica arachnoides suppurated, and the brain in

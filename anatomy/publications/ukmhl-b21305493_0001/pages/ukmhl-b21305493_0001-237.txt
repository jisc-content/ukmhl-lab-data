CiSLLtyLAR SYSTEM. 95 cess externally, during the two first stages of its formation. Internally, it approaches with cer- tain exceptions to the same state. Thus it is easy to prove, that in the latter case, the cellu- lar tissue performs an important, and, I may say, an exclusive part, and that all these phenomena take place in that tissue or its cells. The following observations indisputably establish the cellular nature both of the granulations and of the adventitous membrane that they form : 1st. In those parts which are abundantly furnished with cellular tissue, as in the cheeks, granulations are most readily produced and wounds soonest heal; 2dly. The skin, when de- prived of too much tissue, is slow in throwing out these bodies, and is therefore not easily united with the neighbouring parts. Hence the pre- cept so strongly recommended in surgery, that we should be sparing of that tissue in dissections of tumors, extirpations of wens, cysts, &c.; 3dly. Maceration in the subject always reduces the sur- face of granulated wounds to this primitive ba- sis ; 4thly. The nature of granulations is every where the same, be the organ that produces them what it may, whether muscle, cartilage, skin, bone, or ligament, &c. The only difference exists in the relative quickness of their production, which is regulated by the activity of life, with which each organ is pregnant, and the develope- ment ol the vital powers. In the skin, for exam-

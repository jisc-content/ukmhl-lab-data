OF ANIMAL LIFE. 1C9 optic nerve is an exception to this rule. The membrane that encloses it, is so disposed as to prevent the surrounding vessels from entering laterally. An artery passes through in the direc- tion of the axis, and supplies it with several branches. In the other nerves, the arteries wind at first in the cellular tissue, between the cords, and are of greater or less size, according to the ner-- vous trunks. This size is sometimes considerably 4 increased. For instance. In popliteal aneurism, the artery of the sciatic nerve is frequently seen with a calibre more than three times larger than in its natural state. From the arteries twisting between the cords, project numerous small branches, which resort to the spaces left between the filaments. Finally, from these proceed small capillary arteries, which spread on the theca, winding and crossing it, and continuing with the exhalants of the medullary substance. This vascular distribution is very dis- tinct on the spinal marrow. Numerous ramifica- tions at first spread on the pia-mater dense and tight, and performing the office of the theca ; but they are immersed in the medullary substance, and are lost therein in connection with the ex- halants. Veins in respect to nerves follow a course ana- logous to that of the arteries ; however, in dis- secting carefully several large nervous trunks, I VOL. 1. t

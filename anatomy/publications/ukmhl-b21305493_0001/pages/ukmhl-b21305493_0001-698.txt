CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 556 very distinct during life, can no longer be dis- tinguished. To form a precise and correct idea of the quan- tity of blood that circulates during life in each of these organic systems, it is necessary they should be dissected in living animals. I shall have, in the course of this work, frequent occasions of alluding to, and insisting upon this fact, which in many respects appears to me of the utmost importance. Let fine injections be attended with ever so little success, they still display real vessels, but which did not contain blood during life. Even the coarse injections in our theatres frequently present these phenomena, particularly in the head and neck, &c.; and the more striking if the fluid be fine, and the experiment be dexte- rously performed. I cannot conceive how phy- siologists could have continually admitted the state of injected parts as a standard for blood vessels. By opening any part whatever of a living animal, they would have perceived the illusion. Injections are advantageous in respect to large vessels only, in which the blood is circulated in a mass, under the influence of the heart; they can never completely penetrate the ultimate ramifica- tions of the capillary vessels. I should recommend, that the pupils in our anatomical theatres, after having regularly dis- sected the arteries and veins, should be directed, as an end to their studies on this subject, to

519 OF THE DARK BLOOD. Remarks on the Motion of the Dark Abdominal Blood. s , This uniformity in the course of the motion of the dark abdominal blood, is not only the result of the absence of an impulsive organ, but is also promoted, by the liver not opposing to this fluid such frequent obstacles as the preceding dark blood receives from the lungs. It may be re- marked, in fact, that the liver is exactly to this system, what the lungs are in respect to the pre- ceding : it is the boundary and termination of the circulation we are now7 examining. Now, the liver not being influenced by any kind of dilatation or contraction, deprived of the fluid that incessantly acts on the lungs, the air, which loaded with various heterogeneous substances, is frequently apt to alter the vital powers of that organ, even to such a degree as to obstruct circula- tion, &c., its tissue formed of a resisting and gra- nulated substance, in which no extraordinary mo- tion can take place, excepting that of the general locomotion of the organ, has evidently none of those conditions calculated to produce frequent derangement in the course of the dark circula- tion, that exists within. Add to this, as I have before stated, the absence of the impulsive agent, and we shall conceive: 1st. Why, when the ab- domen is laid open, neither the pulsation nor re-

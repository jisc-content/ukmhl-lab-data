OF THE UliD BLOOD. 385 ver the particles are successively displaced ; but that abrupt motion of a whole mass, (if I may use the expression,) experienced in canals, where they are restrained on every side, and where the impulse is received at one end, has been less con- sidered. Remarks on the Pulse. Two points in this respect have been very evidently proved. 1st. That the heart is the special agent for the arterial motion, and that arteries in this motion act nearly a passive part. 2dly. That it consists in a general shock, suddenly experienced by the whole mass of the red blood, felt at the very same instant in the most distant parts as well as in the trunks, and not in a succes- sive progression of the fluid supplied by the left ventricle. It now remains to examine how the heart can, by that abrupt and instantaneous motion, produce pulsation. We have many difficulties to over- come on this point; but it cannot be doubted that the locomotion of the arterial system has great influence in the production of this pheno- menon. At the instant the vascular mass is thus conveyed from the heart to the most distant parts, as it were by a total motion, it unavoidably tends to straiten the arteries, particularly when incur- vated. This action necessarily determines a mo- tion, which produces the pulsation of the artery. With respect to dilatation : it scarcely exists

498 VASCULAK SYSTEM fact, as the first motion is better comprehended than the second, by thus opposing what we know respecting the one, and what we are labouring to discover of the other, we are proceeding, as it were, from the known to the uncertain. In the following lines I shall give the summary of this comparison, which is still imperfect. 1st. General pulsation of the arteries; ab- sence of this general motion in the veins. 2nd. Rapidity of circulation in the arteries; its slowness in the veins. 3rd. Greater capacity, and more tenuity in the parieties of the veins; the contrary state in the arteries. 4th. The necessity of other assistance to pro- mote the veinous circulation; such means unne- cessary for that of the arteries. 5th. The circulation in arteries performed by jerks ; uniform in that of the veins. 6th. The blood in these last vessels liable to be influenced by the laws of gravity and other ac- cessory causes; such influence ineffectual in the arterial motion. Here is a series of phenomena which, from what has been already stated, evidently proceeds from the presence of an impulsive agent, and the i non-existence of this in the veins. 1st. Constant uniformity of motion in all the arteries ; variety of motion throughout the whole veinous system ; dilatation and contraction, gene-

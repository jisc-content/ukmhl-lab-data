510 VASCULAR SYSTEM two common membranes are essentially different. Thus the tissue of the pulmonary artery, al- though added to the membrane of the veinous circulation, is, with the exception of the differ- ence in thickness, of the same nature as that of the aorta and its divisions. In the same manner, al- though united to the membrane of the arterial circulation, the tissue of the pulmonary veins is the very same as that of all other veins. This uniformity in the tissue naturally implies uniformity in the functions : this, in fact, is really the case. The mechanical laws of the circulation of dark, are the same in the pulmonary artery as those of the red blood in the aorta. Imthe same manner the laws of the general veinous cir- culation preside over those of the pulmonary veins. Inspection proves this. Besides, it must unavoidably be the case, since the connection of the heart with these two kinds of vessels is the same as with the arteries and veins. Each system of blood is then possessed of its two modes of circulation. Instantaneous motion, generally extended, and not a progressive supply of fluid ; pulsation produced by actual locomo- tion ; general straitening of every division of the same trunk at each impulsion of the heart; such are the general mechanical characters ol the vessels for the red blood, as well as of that for the black. Non-existence of pulsation, slowness in the motion of the fluid, inability to straiten,

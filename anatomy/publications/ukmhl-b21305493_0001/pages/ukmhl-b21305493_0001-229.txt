87 CELLULAR SYSTEM. ably excited in its manifestations of sympathy because the two last properties have a sensible preponderance in this system. Sensible organic contractility and animal contractility, are also peculiarly active in the muscular system and its sympathies, according as they belong to the muscles of organic or animal life. The cellular tissue is not only influenced in its sympathies by the other organs, but it also influ- ences them in turn. In phlegmon, which is a species of inflammation peculiar to this sys- tem, the functions of the brain, heart, liver stomach, &c. are successively disordered, if it runs to any considerable height. It gives rise in them to vomitings, redundant secretions of bile, and delirium, which are purely the results of morbid sympathy. In the application of setons, we have a pregnant example of the powerful influence of the cellular system, where its agency is established over other parts. In diseases of the eye, a seton often produces an effect which could not be obtained from a blister; and for what reason ? Because there exists a stronger affinity between the cellular tissue and eye, than is observed between the latter and the integu ments. Character of Vital Properties. From the preceding observations, it is obvious that the principle of life is abundantly developed

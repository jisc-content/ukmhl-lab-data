t 508 VASCULAR SYSTEM stantly observed in old subjects as in the adult- I recollect no instance of it in infancy. The pulmonary artery in old age is not dilated in proportion to the veins of the same system,, because, being screened from external injury, and provided at its origin with an impulsive agent of a firm and resisting tissue, it is less disposed to yield than the others. SECTION IV. Accidental Dev elopement of the Veins. Veins admit of being accidentally developed in two different ways; 1st. In cancerous tumours, in fungouses, &c. in which cases a larger quantity of arterial fluid being admitted, they acquire a volume proportioned to that of the arteries; but as they are superficial, their increase is better seen than that of the arteries, which has led to the mistake that this increase is a distinctive character of cancers and other similar tumours;, but it is only a consequence of the additional nu- trition. The circulation of the blood takes place in these, with the same degree of rapidity as in the other veins ; it is in no way obstructed ; 2dly.

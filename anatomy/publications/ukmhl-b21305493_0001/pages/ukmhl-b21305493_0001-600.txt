VASCULAR SYSTEM 458 For the contrary reason, the descending aorta has a much more extensive distribution than the inferior vena cava. The boundaries of the two cones of the venae cavae are situate at the diaphragm. It is in this respect especially, that this muscle may be said to divide the body into two parts. Does not such disposition influence the difference observed, in certain diseases, between the superior and inferior parts ? Should not this cause, also, be added to those pointed out when speaking of the foetus? With regard to this opinion, which I do not consider improbable, nothing has hitherto been advanced. Although each forms a cfistinct cone, the venae cavse, however, communicate particularly near their common boundaries, that is to say, in the neighbourhood of the diaphragm. The vena azygos is the grand medium of communication; it is well known that its trunk opens into the right renal, the vena cava itself, or into some of the lombar veins, and that the small azygos vein arising from it, also enters the left renal, or in the lombar veins of the same side. This anastomosis is of the utmost importance ; physicians have considered it too slightly : it proves that when there is an ob- struction in the trunk of the inferior vena cava, a great part of the blood of this trunk may be re- turned by the superior. Much has been said re- specting the compression of this trunk, from ob-

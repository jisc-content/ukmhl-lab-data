VASCULAU SYSTEM 376 On the Limits of the Action of the Heart. The heart then is the essential cause of pulsation; it is this organ that actuates all in ' the arterial motion: its influence has been too much exaggerated by several authors. They have admitted, that its impulse is suffi- cient to produce not only the arterial mo- tion, but also that of the general capillary sys- tem, and even of the veins, so that in their opinion, the contraction of the left ventricle is the cause of that extensive course the blood takes from this to the right ventricle ; but nume- rous proofs, as we shall perceive, fully establish that when this fluid has once reached the general capillary system, it is absolutely without the influence of the heart, and that it is then moved only by the tonic powers of these minute vessels ; and, that for a still greater reason, all the influence of the left ventricle is perfectly lost to the veinous system. It is in these respects the authors alluded to have erred, and not in having admitted the influence of the heart upon the arterial system. We are now, I believe, enabled to fix the limits of the heartâ€™s influence over the blood, by fixing them to that part where this fluid, in the general capillary system, is transformed from red into black. As it gradually enters these minute

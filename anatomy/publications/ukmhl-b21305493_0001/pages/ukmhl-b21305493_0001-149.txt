CELLULAR SYSTEM. 7 the skin is in this case drawn down from its place, and may be said to undergo absolute locomotion. It is also to this tissue that organs subjacent to the skin partly owe the facility with which they move, in those powerful contractions of which they are capable. Fat, which is contained in great abundance in its cells, contributes to secure the subjacent parts from the keen effects of atmos- pheric air. It is well known that this fluid is secreted in greater quantity in winter than in summer; that it is found in considerable propor- tion beneath the skin of such animals as inhabit cold* climates: that emaciation, a natural result of severe disease, renders the body peculiarly susceptible of cold, &c. The effusion of serum appears to take place in the sub-cutaneous tissue in a much larger pro- portion than in other parts ; it has a. particular tendency to accumulate there, in consequence, without doubt, of the excessive laxity of this membrane. If we compare the quantity of fluid that fills this tissue in an anasarcas limb, with that which occupies the space between the muscles and the interstices between the fibres of different sub- jacent organs, we shall find that there is no comparison between the two, and that the size of the limb is proportionally more encreased by the distention of the sub-cutaneous part of the cellular tissue than of that more deeply seated. To see this clearly, we must compare an inferior extre-

Asphyxia, apoplexy, and every affection that causes the veinous blood to stagnate in the gene- ral capillary system, prove the same thing: in fact, if we only examine the livid head of a stran- gulated or apoplectic subject, we shall find that it was especially in the skin, and in the cellular tissue, where the circulation was obstructed ; that the muscles and the aponeurosis contain only a very small quantity of superabundant fluid, in addition to what they habitually possess, when compared with that in the former organs. Bemarks on Injections, From what has hitherto been stated, it is evi- dent that fine injections, which are so very effec- tual in elucidating the capillary system in an organ, are of no use whatever in discriminating between the vessels of this system that admit the red blood, and those in which white fluids are exclusively circulated. In fact the injected fluid penetrates both indiscriminately, and what was so v u 2

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 558 face of the skin displays the same phenomenon* although less frequently. If this organ be irritated in any part whatever, it instantly acquires a redder colour; and if compressed, it becomes whiter. Heat and cold invariably produce similar varieties, if the transition be abrupt, and every mucous sur- face displays the same disposition. Let us only consider the glans penis, in the ardour of coition, or in the succeeding state, the difference in the quantity of blood contained in its external mem- brane is remarkably striking. If a serous surface be laid bare, at first white, it soon becomes co- vered with numerous streaks. If the capillary vessels of the glands could be made visible, I conceive that these minute vessels would be found to contain variable quantities of blood, and that whilst their secreted fluids flow from these organs in abundance, their system is more abundantly supplied than at any other time with that which provides the materials. Why should not the kidneys and the liver, in the same manner as the surface of the skin, be subject to the same varie- ties in respect to the quantity of blood ? When after violent exertion, perspiration flows in abundance, does not the surface of the body redder than usual, prove that a greater propor- tion of blood has penetrated the skin ? Two things, however, in this respect, ought to be distinguished. It is only when the abundance of secretions proceeds from an increase of vitality

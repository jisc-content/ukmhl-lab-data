OF TFIE DARK BLOOD. 445 generally less voluminous in proportion to their arteries than the veins of the spermatic cord are to the artery of that name, or than the hypo- gastric vein when compared with the correspond- ing artery : the blood circulates with more facility in the former than in the latter, in which it ascends contrary to gravity ; this again explains why the veins, in the inferior parts, especially at a certain age, exceed in a greater degree their arteries in diameter than those of the superior parts are seen to exceed theirs. Ramifications, Branches, Angles of Re-union, tyc. The veins with respect to branches and ramifi- cations of every description, present in their course a disposition analogous to that of the arte- ries, with this distinction only, that it exists in a reverse sense. The ramifications are the nearest to the origin; they soon unite into small branches, which form larger ones, and these again are united into trunks. The ramifications and the greatest part of the smaller branches are situate within the organs. The former are amongst the constituent parts of these organs, and are found amongst their fibres, &c. The latter are lodged in the large intersticesâ€”in the glands, amongst the lobes; in

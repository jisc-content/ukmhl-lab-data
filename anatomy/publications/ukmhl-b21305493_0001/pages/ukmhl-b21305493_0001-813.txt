EXHALANT SYSTEM. 671 the disease in the vital powers of the membrane, are excessively variable. Thus we shall find the glands affording a com- mon issue through which flow, accordingly as they are affected, a number of substances essen- tially differing from those by which these fluids in their natural state are performed. SECTION IV. Accidental Developement of the Exhalants. The exhalants are accidentally developed in a variety of parts; in cysts especially, they are very evident. Their internal surfaces, gene- rally smooth, shed very distinct fluids, according to their peculiar mode of sensibility. On opening these cysts, the exhalants furnish a new supply of fluids. To prevent exhalation, it frequently requires they should be removed. Sometimes, instead of the fluids they exhale, blood is pro- duced, as is the case with the serous surfaces; for instance, I have found the serum verv like blood in the incysted dropsies of the ovary; lately I have found coagulated blood. I remark that this is another essential difference between the fluids exhaled and those secreted ; in fact, these are n^ver accidentally effused in cysts ; we never find preternatural collections of bile, urine.

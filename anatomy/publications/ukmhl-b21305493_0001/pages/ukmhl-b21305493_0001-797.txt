655 EXHALANT SYSTEM. fevers, when they are entirely suppressed. In every other case, whenever one fluid is abundantly pro- duced, the others are diminished : thus dryness of the skin coincides with dropsies. It has been re- marked that perspiration is very abundant in the early stages of pulmonary consumptions ; but that towards the termination of the disease, when leu- cophlegmacy has made considerable progress, the perspirations subside. I have also separated into two classes, the causes of increased exhalations. '1st. Some denote an increase of vitality. 2dly. Others an actual decline of the vital powers. Hence, the active and passive exhala- tions. How the very same phenomenon can pro- ceed from two causes exactly opposed to each other, is not easily determined with precision ; but such an innumerable multiplicity of phenomena contribute to form this distinction, as well in re- gard to secretion as to exhalation, that it must be admitted. It is very important to recollect this on perusing the next chapter. SECTION III. Preternatural Exhalations. By this appellation I distinguish those in which the exhalants emit a fluid different from that they

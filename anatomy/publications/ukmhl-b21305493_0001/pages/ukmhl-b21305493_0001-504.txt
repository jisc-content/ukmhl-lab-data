362 VASCULAR SYSTEM Insensible Organic Contractility. Insensible organic contractility, or tone, is very evident in arteries. In the large trunks, and wherever the pulsation is striking, its functions are exclusivelv confined to nutrition and to ex- halation, if this, which I do not believe, takes place within the arteries. From the moment the influence of the heart on the blood contained in these vessels has ceased, that is to say, where the capillary system begins, then the tone also begins to influence not only the nutrition of the vascular parieties, but likewise the circulation performed in that system; it is even exclusively in virtue of the tonic forces that circulation, as will be seen, is carried on in these small vessels; the heart has positively nothing to do with it. I shall treat of this property in the general capillary system ; here it only acts an auxiliary part. In respect to organic sensibility, it evidently exists in arteries, since it can never be separated from the preceding contractility; like this, it is rather obscure in large trunks, which are only possessed of wâ€™hat is necessary for their nu- trition. From such a slight degree of developement of the organic powers in the arterial texture, it evidently results, that such affections as are espe- cially under the influence of these properties are

EXHALANT SYSTEM. 654. which is so frequently ascertained in inflammation. I do not allude to the derangement that may be produced by the continuity of organs, &c. &c. From this it results, that whenever exhalation is preternaturally increased or diminished, the de- gree of sensibility in the exhalants is always mo- dified in one of the three preceding ways. Now, if we reflect upon the different kinds of exhalants, we shall find that, excepting the cutaneous and mucous, scarcely any are exposed to immediate excitement, because these alone are connected with external forms. Besides the two modes of alteration in sensibility, of which they partake with the rest, they have this also. Is it not then surprising that their exhaled fluids, especially those of the skin, afford such very fre- quent varieties, that the skin is found in a state constantly varying from the utmost degree of dryness to that of the most abundant perspira- tion ? The sympathetic exhalations are excessively numerous. Here I shall produce no instances of them : they are frequently met with in viewing the sympathies of the dermoidal, serous, and mu- cous systems, &c. Authors, however, have not sufficiently distinguished these exhalations, nor have they paid sufficient attention to sympathetic secretions. The several exhalations never increase or fall all at the same time, excepting, however, in the erethema at the commencement of certain

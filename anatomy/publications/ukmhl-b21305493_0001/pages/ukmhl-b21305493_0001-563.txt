But when the parts have attained their full extent, and this system still continues to receive the supply intended for growth, real arterial plethora must necessarily be the consequence.

Thus, all we have stated regarding the pre-disposition to several diseases, in the different stages of life, &c., admits, consequently, of numberless exceptions. By degrees, this predominance of the lungs is lost; an equilibrium is established in all the organs, each of which, till then, had in turn, taken a more or less important part in the phenomena, relative to the different stages of life.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. lxxxii transmittingâ€™ its impression, and that with which the skin, nerves, &c. are endued, not only of being conscious of the impression of external bodies, but also of transmitting it to the brain, so that the sensation be perceived. If we were to comprehend under the common term of irritability, both the motions of the mus- cles which contract only on the application of stimuli, and those that the brain wills into action, our meaning would be absolutely unintelligible. A whole century has been wasted on that doubtful question, whether sensibility be the same as contractility, or if the two properties are inse- parable from each other. The grounds of either opinion have appeared to be equally tenable. All these disputes are set at final rest by admitting the distinction I have" established between vital properties. In fine, 1st, in animal life it is evi- dent that contractility is not a necessary conse- quence of sensibility ; thus external objects act often a long time upon us, and yet the voluntary muscles are unmoved: 2dly, on the other hand, in organic life these two properties are never sepa- rated. In involuntary motions of the heart, sto- mach, intestines, &c. there is first, excitement of organic sensibility, and afterwards, of sensible organic contractility. In the same manner, in those motions necessary to secretion, exhalation, &c., as soon as organic sensibility is excited, in- sensible organic contractility immediately follows

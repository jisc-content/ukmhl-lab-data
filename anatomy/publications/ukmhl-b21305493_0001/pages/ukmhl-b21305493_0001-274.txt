I will speak of its mode of continuity upon the nerves in treat- ing of the membrane proper to these. Nerves run over a space more or less consider- able before they pass out of the cranium or ver- tebral canal; 1st, The two proceeding from the brain display a greater extent inwardly than out- wardly ; 2dly, Amongst those of the tuber an- nulare, and of its dependencies, the pathetic only remain a considerable time in the scull before they pass out and have more of their length within than outwardly: all the others make their exit almost instantly ; 3dly, The nerves of the spine run a greater distance in pro- portion as they are examined lower down. Above they become external almost imme- diately ; lower down they are more than six inches in length within the canal, and conse- quently correspond with several foramina, before they reach their own: from whence it results, as Jadelot has observed, that if we make use of the spinal apophyses, on account of their protuberance, to judge of the origin of nerves, in the application of the rnoxa, we must, in order to operate in the neck, on a level with the origin of any nerve whatever, take the spinal apophysis exactly, which answers to the number corresponding to the pair we have in view; whilst, if we operate in the re-

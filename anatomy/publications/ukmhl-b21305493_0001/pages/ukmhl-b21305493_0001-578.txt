436 VASCULAR SYSTEM those of the red. Frequently their course is seen through the integuments, and so much the more as these are whiter and of a finer texture ; in other respects, however, they are not connected with those which proceed entirely from the blood con- tained in the capillary system. Within the body, the veins accompany the arteries in almost every part ; they follow the very same distribution ; so that they are not commonly described, because the course followed by arteries is sufficient to trace theirs. In general, a cellular space common to all, receives both the trunks of these two species of vessels, and those of the nerves. Sometimes, however, veins are found quite insulated, as the azygos, for instance, which has no corresponding arterial trunk, and which, on this account, like the superficial veins of the trunk and extremities, requires, in descrip- tive anatomy, a special investigation and a minute dissection to convey a correct idea of them. SECTION III. Proportion of Capacity between the two Systems of the Dark and the lied Blood. In consequence of the observations I have just made, respecting the origin and the course of the

78 cellular system. played in a remarkable manner in an infinitude of cases, such as oedema, accumulation of fat, and the varieties of tumors where its cells are con- siderably enlarged and its membranes stretched to an unusual length. No individual natural motion of the body could be performed without this pro- perty ; the arm could not be raised if the cellular tissue of the axilla did not admit of being increased two or three-fold beyond its usual extent in a state of repose and inaction. The flexion and extension of the thigh, neck, and almost every other part, exhibit the same effect, but in different degrees. If you raise any organ whatsoever, from that di- rectly contiguous to it, the intermediate tissue must be lengthened in proportion. This property is subject to various modifications in the tissue to which it belongs. In the subcutaneous, the sub- serous, and intermuscular tissues, its limits are much less circumscribed than the submucous, or that, external to arteries, veins, and excretory vessels. Its existence, however, is undeniable in the latter, as is proved by the dilatations of the abdominal viscera, aneurisms, varices, &c. These phenomena themselves, nevertheless, also shew that very little of the property resides in this species of tissue :â€”the common tissue for in- stance could not resist the motion of the blood, after the rupture of the arterial coats. If the arteries had no other covering but this, the consequence in such a case would infallibly

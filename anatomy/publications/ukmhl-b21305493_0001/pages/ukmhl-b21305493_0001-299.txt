I should think it would be impossible to deny this kind of conti- nuity in the origin of the optic and olfactory nerves, in which this substance only is displayed; in the au- ditory this is also very apparent; in the spinal marrow, by scraping the white substance at the in- ternal surface of the pia-mater, so as to leave the nerves adhering to this membrane, it is evidently perceived at the point where these nerves project, that there is an extension which sinks into their theca. Comparison of the Medullary Substances of the Brain and Nerves. What is the nature of the medullary substance in nerves? I have attempted to draw a line of com- parison between this and the cerebral substance. In some respects there is a considerable analogy : where is the difference in others ? 1st. The white substance of the brain, when dried in the open air, and in thin slices, to avoid putrefaction, becomes yellow, and acquires a certain consistence. The dried nerve also becomes yellow, inflexible, and contracts upon itself. The changes in this case are without doubt in part owing to the theca and its system. The proof of this is, that if the envelope- ment with which the pia-mater supplies the spinal marrow, an envelopement that has so much ana-

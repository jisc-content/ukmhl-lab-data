VASCULAR SYSTEM 350 t SECTION II. Properties of the Texture.â€”Extensibility. The extensibility of the arteries maybe viewed in two respects. 1st. Transversely, 2dly. Lon- gitudinally. Arteries in their diameter, have only a very limited extensibility. 1st. Whatever attempts are made to dilate them by injections of water, of greasy substances, by inflating them, &c., their natural diameter is very little increased. 2dly. I have mentioned that their texture is remarkable for a kind of brittleness, and that in cases of aneurism, when somewhat distended with blood, they will sooner break than yield, and that the cellular tunic only, which, on account of the degree of extensibility it possesses and derives from the system, of which it is a part, is adapted to form cysts, in which the blood is contained. It is even this that essentially distinguishes aneu- rismal tumours from varices. 3dly. When a liga- ture lias been applied to the superior part of the carotid artery of a dog, the blood forcibly pressed against this ligature that stops its course re-acts violently against the coats of the vessel, and yet this dilatation is hardly perceptible. We must not, however, conclude from this, that arteries

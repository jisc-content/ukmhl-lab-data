The mucous glands, in two different cases, secrete a greater quantity of fluid, sometimes from irrita- tion, on other occasions, from a deficiency of power. When this takes place in the intestines? diarrhoea from irritation is the result in the first case, colliquative diarrhoea in the second. Now it appears, that a greater quantity of blood reaches the gland in one instance, than in the other; in the greatest number of acute catarrhs, in which there is an active secretion of mucus, the increase of this fluid cannot be doubted. The circumstance of its decrease, or at least, its remaining sta- tionary, is not less striking in a number of chro- nic catarrhs, in which secretion may be considered as passive. We are aware, that the quantity of urine and of bile, implies sometimes an increased, at other times a diminished action, in the spleen and in the liver. Is there not also a superabun- dance of semen from excess of vitality and an un- natural emission from want of power: it is the same with every secreted fluid. Now in these op- posite instances of superabundant secretion of fluid, the capillary system of the glands is cer- tainly penetrated with different quantities of blood. Although the phenomenon is the same, yet the treatment in diseases in which it occurs, must, as in the preceding cases, be quite reversed, accordingly as it is produced by an increase or diminution of vitality in the part.

OF ANIMAL LIFk. 191 which is derived from strict observation; let us lay aside all reasonings, whenever their basis is not founded on just experience. Some modern authors have not been so judicious; they have ad- mitted of a nervous atmosphere extending more or less, and acting in a determined distance ; so that, although an organ is not supplied with nerves, it suffices that it is within the atmosphere of a nervous cord, to become the seat of sensa- tions. This ingenious idea of Reil may be classed with the number of those which Bordeu has mingled in his works, and which bespeak more the genius of the author than a correct and judi- cious mind, averse to all opinion that has not a strict experience as its basis. In fact, what is this atmosphere ? Is it a constant emanation from the exterior part of the nerves ? Is it a fluid inde- pendent of them, and with which nature has sur- rounded every nervous thread, in the same man- ner as she has encircled the globe with atmosphe- ric air ? Is it a power that has been given to nerves, to act at a distance, without any interme- diate agent ? It is true that some experiments in galvanism have seemed to prove something simi- lar in nerves; but these experiments bear no rela- tion to the transmission of animal sensibility ; be- sides, whenever pain is created in the centre of a very thick tendon,â€”in that of a large joint, (in that of the knee, for instance) it would then be requisite that the atmosphere of nervous activity

453 OF THE DARK BLOOD. ^anastomosis ; before such dilatation can be com- pletely performed, it remains stationary, as it were, in the capillary system,â€”a state of stagna- tion that accounts for the temporary flush ob- served in the arms of females, when too much compressed by a narrow sleeve, or that of the hand and foot, when the bandages of these parts have been too tightly applied. The mode of anastomosis in veins is very ana- logous to that of the arteries. Sometimes the small branches anastomose with the trunks, at other times the trunks communicate with each other. In this last mode ; 1st. The communication is formed by a small branch; it is seen between the jugular veins, between the deep and super- ficial veins of the thigh, of the arm, &c.; 2dly. Two branches are joined at their extremities, forming an arch, of which the mesenteric veins afford an instance ; 3dly. Sometimes, instead of a trunk, there is a net work of ramifications, such as that which surrounds the cord of the spermatic vessels. In general, it may be considered, that in those parts where the blood meets with more obstacles, anastomosis is the most common. This is the rea- son why the veins that surround the spermatic cord so frequently communicate ; why the ramifications of the hypogastric vein that extend to the lower part, form a plexus so intricate as to repre-

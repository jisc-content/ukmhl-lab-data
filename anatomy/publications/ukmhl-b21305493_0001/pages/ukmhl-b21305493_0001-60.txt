I shall now enter into the consideration of an important object, to which we are naturally conducted by the pre- ceding remarks, namely, the comparison of phy- sical phenomena with those of life, or the phy- sical with the physiological sciences. section hi. Characteristic Marks of Vital Properties com- pared with those of Physical Properties. If we balance the phenomena of the physical with those of the physiological sciences, we shall find that their nature and essence are separated by almost immeasurable distance from each other, owing to the total dissimilitude of their respective laws. The laws of natural philosophy are constant and invariable ; they admit neither of diminution nor increase : we know of no instance in which a stone gravitates towards the earth with more than its accustomed force, or where marble possesses more than its ordinary elasticity ; on the contrary the vital properties are at every instant under- going some change in degree and kind; they are scarcely ever the same.

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 572 fluids never enter vessels in which blood circu- lates? Why does not blood flow from the ex- halants, the excretories, &c., since these tubes have direct communications with the arteries, through the anastomosis of the capillary system ? This proceeds entirely from the connection that exists between the organic sensibility of each part of the system and the fluid it contains. Those which contain the blood are irritated by other fluids which, on approaching, cause them to contract, and by a similar cause the blood cannot enter the other vessels. Why does the trachea admit of air only and reject other fluids ? Why do the lacteals select chyle only amongst the in- testinal matters ? Why again are these substances never admitted into the excretory vessels that open into the intestines ? Why, in short, does the skin exclusively absorb peculiar substances, and not admit of others, &c. ? All this depends upon each part, each portion of an organ, each organized particle in short, being in some mea- sure possessed of its peculiar mode of sensibility, which is connected with one substance only, and rejects the others. But since this mode of sensibility is liable to vary, its connections with the substances foreign to the organ also varies; thus a part of the ca- pillary system, that has rejected blood, will ad- mit of this fluid from the moment its sensibility â–  9 has been excited. If any part of the skin be ir-

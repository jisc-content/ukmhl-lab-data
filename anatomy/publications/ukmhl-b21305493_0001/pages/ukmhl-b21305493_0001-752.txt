CAPILLARY systems. 610 independent temperature. To produce heat, it is sufficient that foreign substances be incessantly assimilated with the humours of organized forms, and, that subsequent to this, these humours, whe- ther they are blood, as in animals possessed of red blood, either warm or cold, or of a different nature, as in those which circulate white fluids, and in plants, it is sufficient to say, that they undergo in the capillary system different changes. Respiration combines more caloric with the blood, consequently, this principle is formed in greater quantity in animals that breathe by lungs than in others; and even in the first class, the larger the lungs the greater the heat, as is proved by comparing birds and quadrupeds, the ceta- ceous tribe in fishes, &c. These variations, how- ever, relate only to the degree of temperature; hence, there are animals possessed of cold blood, and those in which it is warm. The general phenomena in the production of heat, both in animals provided with lungs, and in those in which this mode of respiration is wanting, and in plants, will ever remain the same. From these principles the greatest part of the phenomena relating to animal heat are easily conceived. The production of heat is, in all instances, subordinate to the state of the vital powers.

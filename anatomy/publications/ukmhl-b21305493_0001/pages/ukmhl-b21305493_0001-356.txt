NERVOUS SYSTEM 214 prove it :â€”It is well known that irritating the uvula will cause the stomach to contract; then, as the mucous surface is exactly the same in the one case as in the other, this sympathetical phe- nomenon might be attributed to this circum- stance. In consequence, I inflicted a wound in the lateral part of the neck of a dog ; I seized the oesophagus and cut it transversely ; the uvula was then irritated ; well, the dog, notwithstand- ing the breach of continuity, still made efforts to vomit. Let us then acknowledge, that we are perfectly unacquainted with the causes of sympa- thies of sensible organic contractility. 4thly. As much might be said in respect to the sympathies of organic sensibility, and of in- sensible contractility, we have ascertained that nerves have no kind of influence on these two pro- perties ; that by acting upon them they are nei- ther increased or decreased in any way whatever; that their diseases never disturb the functions over which these properties preside ; that when they are sympathetically disordered, the nerves seem to act a neutral part in these phenomena. Thus, 1st. all sympathetic exhalations, as hectic sweats, peculiar serous infiltrations, almost spon- taneously produced, &c.; 2dly, all secretions of the same nature as those which take place in a variety of diseases, afford us examples, &c.; all analogous absorption, triple functions, governed by the preceding properties, are evidently uncon-

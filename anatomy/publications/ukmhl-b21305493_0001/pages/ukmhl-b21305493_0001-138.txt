XCviii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS, 2dlv. When we deprive organs of their respec- tive nutritive substances, the bones for example, of their phosphate of lime by means of acids, and the gluten, by those of concoction, a residue is left evidently of vessels and cellular membrane. 3dly. It is certain that the process of consolidation, in divided parts, is the same as that of their natural nutrition. Thus in the healing of wounds, the parenchyma of nutrition begins first to display itself,and is everywhere the same; it shews itself every where in the form of granulated points,which are cellular and vascular, and have the same character and aspect, whether they shoot from a bone or cartilage, or whether they.are formed in muscle, ligament, or the skin, &c. All breaches of substance resemble each other, as organs do, with regard to this common parenchyma: that which constitutes the difference between them, as be- tween the organs, is the nutritive substance, which interposes itself in its tissue, and varies according to the part affected : thus the phosphate of lime encrusting the granulations of bones, gives a different nature to the callus from that of mus- cular wounds, which are united by the exhalation of fibrine in the granulations that are produced on the divided surfaces, &c. 4thlv, The mucous substance, which forms the body of the embryo, appears to be nothing but cellular, or mucous tissue, as Bordeu calls it, a texture redundant with blood vessels and nerves. In fine, when

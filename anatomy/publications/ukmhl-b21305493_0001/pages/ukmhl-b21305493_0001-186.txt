CELLULAR SYSTEM. 44 cold air. When the temperature of atmospheric air is increased, the dissolution takes place in the same way, but there is no apparent cloud, as the vapour is not condensed. Cellular serum varies in quantity according* to the situation where it is produced. It seems to be rather more abundant in such parts as are de- prived of fat, namely the scrotum, eyelids, pre- i puce, &c. It is likewise to be observed, that these parts are much more liable to infiltrations of fluid : under this head the scrotum ranks first, next the eyelids, and lastly the prepuce, &c. We must here remark, that the cellular tissue external to mucous surfaces, to arteries, veins, and excre- tories, a tissue which resembles the latter in the absence of fat, differs from it in respect of serum, being, as I have already mentioned, subject to no serous infiltrations. I must remark, that we cannot judge of the quantity of cellular serum, by observations made on the dead body, the laxity of whose various parts allows the several fluids to transude through their vessels, and penetrate the surrounding cel- lular tissue. To determine the quantity of moisture, I first distend the integuments of an animal with air, so as to produce emphysema, and afterwards make a pretty free incision along the skin, which is followed by a very slight effusion of blood, owing to the collapse of the vessels, produced by the general tumefaction.

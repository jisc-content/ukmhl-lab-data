146 NERVOUS SYSTEM ARTICLE II. Organization of the Nervous System in Animal Life. SECTION I. The peculiar Texture of that Organization. Every nerve is formed, as I have already stated, of a more or less considerable number of cords in apposition. These cords proceed from filaments similarly disposed, and united together in the same manner by a portion of the cellular membrane. I have already described how, in the interior of the nerve, they interweave with each other, so as to form within a kind of plexus, which differ only from the true plexus, in their branches being so closely applied to each other that their plaitings cannot be discovered at the first glance. - The general disposition of the nervous cords vary considerably. 1st. They are not everywhere of the same thickness. Those of the sciatic and crural nerves are looser than those of the brachial, excepting, however, the median. 2dly. Several nerves, as the par vagum, are formed by a single cord divided by numerous furrows. Sometimes it is inclosed by a net-work of filaments, attended all round with a kind of very delicate plexus. 3dly. The same nerve will sometimes conjoin cords of different sizes. In several, as in the sci-

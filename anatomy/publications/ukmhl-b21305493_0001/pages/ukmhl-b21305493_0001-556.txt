414* VASCULAR SYSTEM between them the handle of the scalpel, they are easily separated, and scarcely any signs of lacera- tion remain. If they were disposed in such a manner that the blood might filtrate, they would soon separate, and the communication would be re-established. Let authors, then, give^ themselves no further trouble in seeking to explain how life can be continued whenever the foramen ovale has re- mained free : it is as though it did not exist; the blood will no more flow through it in one instance than in the other. The obliteration of this foramen, the blood ceasing to flow through it, are, as we may see, phenomena in some degree mechanical. The laws of vitality also are not inactive on this occasion. Who can tell if the sensibility of the auricle, stimulated and recently modified by i the red blood, does not repel the black that tended to enter it through the foramen ? Every day we see in the economy fluids cross apertures without entering them, although these remain open, and for this reason only, that their sensi- bility is not connected with such fluids. Why does the trachea convulsively reject every fluid and solid? How happens it that air only is admit- ted ? Why is the blood never seen to enter the thoracic duct, which in many cases is only provided with a valve, that is not sufficient to impede its course, and sometimes does not exist ? Why does

717 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. chyle that circulates through them, and from their contraction when brought in contact with sulphu- ric acid; but this, as well as every concentrated acid and caloric, will produce the same effect on â€¢ every animal substance, even after death : namely, a shrinking. When the absorbents, and particu- larly the thoracic duct, are touched with the point of a scapel, no contraction is ever observed. If sensible of contraction, it seems to be when they have ceased to be distended, and not when they have been irritated ; consequently it is performed by the contractility of the tissue. Sensible or- ganic contractility is, therefore, at least doubtful in this system, or if it exist, it is very obscure, and at the utmost can only be compared with that qf the dartos. The absorbents are evidently possessed of or- ganic sensibility, and insensible organic contracti- lity. It is by these properties that they perform their functions, and the fluids are circulated in their ramifications, &c. &c. These two properties are here so much more remarkable, as they survive death itself for some time. A fluid injected when the animal still retains some degree of heat, is absorbed either on the serous surfaces, or on the mucous, and less so in the cellular tissue. This faculty of absorbing might even be continued by maintaining heat artificially, by means of a bath ; but this process is less efficacious than I at first thought; for a long time, various experiments

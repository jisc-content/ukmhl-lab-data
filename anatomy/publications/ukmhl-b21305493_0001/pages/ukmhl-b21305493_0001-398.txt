256 NERVOUS SYSTEM suffering. I have watched that state, which suc- ceeds the agitation caused by the incision of the abdominal walls, then I have laid bare the semi- lunar ganglion, and have strongly irritated it; the animal was not agitated; whilst, as soon as I irritated a cerebral or lombar nerve, he cried, struggled, and attempted to rise. It appears, that in general, sensibility in ganglions is much less striking than that of many other organs ; un- doubtedly the skin, the mucous system, the me- dullary, the nervous system of animal life sur- passes them in this respect. Our ignorance of the diseases that are seated in ganglions, the distance by which these organs are secured from external stimulants, leave us com- pletely in the dark in respect to their sympathies. I believe it highly probable, however, that these sympathies act a prominent part in hysteria, in some peculiar kinds of epilepsies, in which the fit commences, as in those of hysteria, with a painful sensation in the epigastrium ; in those numerous affections denominated nervous, and which the vulgar confound under the appellation of vapours. One of the most important objects of research in nervous diseases, is to distinguish those, which have their special seat in the cerebral nervous system, from those which affect more particularly the system of ganglions. On the one hand, let us place palsies, hemiplegia, the convulsions of infants, tetanus, catalepsy, apoplexy, the greater

The chapter on nerves, in most of the treatises on physiology, is almost entirely devoted to the exa- mination of this question, which I shall not here consider, because I have nothing to produce sup- ported by experiments. Besides, cannot we study and analyse the phenomena of the nerves, with- out being acquainted with their mode of action ? It has been the fault in all the ancient authors, to begin where we must ultimately leave off. The science was still in its infancy, when every ques- tion that was agitated turned upon the primary causes of the vital phenomena. What has been the result ? A mass of absurd reasonings, and, finally, the necessity of returning to a strict ob- servation of those phenomena, and of laying aside their causes, till sufficient information to establish theories had been obtained. Thus have they dis- puted for ages on the nature of fire, of light, of heat, and cold, &c. till at last philosophers have felt, that before arguing, it was unavoidable to found a basis for reasoning. This they have sought for, and have given birth to experi- mental physics. Thus have the schools been agi- tated by interminable disputes on the nature of the soul, on that of understanding, &c. until metaphysicians have been convinced, that instead of inquiries after the nature of our intellectual fa-

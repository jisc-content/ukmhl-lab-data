XXX111 general considerations. but where their action is inseparable from that of the fluids. The stimulus of the fluids is necessary to the contraction of the heart, and the capillary system, &c. As long as they are in their natural state, they produce a natural ex- citement ; but if their nature be once vitiated, if their principles be once changed, that instant they become unnatural stimuli, they excite irre- gular actions, the functions are disturbed, and disease ensues. We see then that fluids often become the vehicle of morbid matter : but this deserves more detailed consideration hereafter. The division of fluids into these, of composition and decomposition, is applicable here. The first, which are introduced by the different channels into the body, must resort to the blood which belongs to them in one respect, and, in another, to the fluids of decomposition. It is indisputable, 1st, That chyle may abound in numberless he- terogeneous substances, and thus convey into the blood the elements of disease, as when putrid matters, badly digested, and principles of contagion mixed with the food, &c. are received into the primse vise. 2dly, We have proofs without number, that absorption by the skin frequently introduces the causes of disease into that fluid. 3dly, That those substances, differing from the constituent principles of air, and cal- culated for the production of disease, are also acci- d 2

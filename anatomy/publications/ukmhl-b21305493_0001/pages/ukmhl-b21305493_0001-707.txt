CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 565 Consequences of the preceding Remarks. From all that has been previously stated, it is evident, that in every organ in which the capil- lary system is filled partly with blood, and partly with other fluids, the proportion of the former, with the latter, must vary very considerably ; that innu- merable causes, as well in health as in disease, by conveying to the organ a greater or less quantity of fluid, may affect the capillary system in a simi- lar manner. Are the trunks Â£<ad branches that resort to an organ, more or less dilated accordingly as the capillary system in that organ contains a larger or smaller quantity of blood; for instance, are the adjoining branches more filled when the secre- tion of the mucous glands is increased ? Some ex- periments I shall hereafter point out, seem to prove it. SECTION IV. Anastomosis of the General Capillary System. All that has hitherto been stated, evidently admits of a free communication between all the parts of the capillary system ; such communica-

VASCULAR SYSTEM 428 the motions of the heart; but the slow and quick pulse, the strong and the feeble, the intermittent, the undulatory, &c., by laying the heart bare, and by placing at the same time the finger on an artery, will be instantly conceived. During the short moments preceding death, we shall con- stantly find, that, whatever may be the changes of the pulse, there is always something analogous in the motion of the heart, which undoubtedly would not be the case if pulsation depended especially upon the vital contraction of the arte- ries. I have had frequent opportunities of re- peating these experiments, either directly for this purpose, or with other views; but I have never seen the motions of the heart at variance with that of arteries. In general, the theory of the pulse requires, as I have said before, new re- searches ; but I have accumulated a sufficient number of facts on this head to ascertain that the varieties it experiences, according to the different ages, and under other circumstances, depend almost exclusively upon the heart, which, in par- ticular, produces that kind of undulation, or oscillatory movement, which is intermediate to the pulsation of the natural state, and the entire loss of motion.

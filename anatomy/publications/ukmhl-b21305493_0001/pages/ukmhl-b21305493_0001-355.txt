213 OF ANIMAL LIFE. previous to those of which I now produce the first results, and which I intend to multiply in other points of view. There are then two things existing in all sympathies of animal con- tractility, namely: 1st, The action of the suffer- ing organ upon the brain, by means with which we are but imperfectly acquainted ; 2dly, The re-action of the brain on the voluntary mus- cles. In this latter period of the sympathy, the nerves of animal life are always the indispensable agents. 3dly. The cerebral nerves, as well as the brain, are evidently unconnected with the sympathies by which sensible organic contractility, or irrita- bility, are put in motion. In fact, if this were the case, it would be requisite that the affected organ should first act upon the brain, and that this viscus should re-act on the involuntary mus- cles : thus, when tickling brings on vomiting, this would require a double action of the skin upon the brain, and of the brain upon the stomach. The brain then influences the involuntary muscles. Whatever may be the irritation upon the nerves with which they are supplied, they remain un- . touched. Now, although the brain might be sym- pathetically affected, it would not re-act on the involuntary muscles ; then cerebral nerves have nothing to do with the sympathies of sensible or- ganic contractility. The continuity of the mem- branes is not a more certain cause; the following

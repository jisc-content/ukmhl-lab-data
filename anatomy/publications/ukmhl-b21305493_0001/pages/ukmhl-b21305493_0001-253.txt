Ill CELLULAR SYSTEM. namely, how cysts unfold ; how a membrane that does not exist in the natural state can arise, increase, and in particular circumstances, even acquire a very considerable expansion. This pro- blem is generally resolved in the following man- ner : at first a small quantity of fluid gathers in one of the cells. This fluid increases, dilates the cell in every direction, its parietes adhere to the adjoining cells, and thus its thickness is increased. By degrees this fluid, which is serous in dropsies, whitish and thick in steatoma, &c. increases in quantity, expands in every direction the bag that contains it, enlarges and compresses it against the neighbouring organs, and gives it the form in which it appears. Nothing at first glance is more simple than this mechanical explanation ; nothing however more distant from the process of nature. The following considerations will aid the proof of this : 1st, Cysts are in every respect analogous to serous membranes. Why then should their mode of origin be different from that of these membranes, which, as I shall prove, are never formed by the compression of the cellular tissue ? 2d, Does so mechanical an origin,where the vessels compressed against each other must unavoidably be obliterated, as is seen in the skin when it has become callous, accord with the functions of exhalation and absorption of cysts, with their pe- culiar mode of inflammation ? 3d. How can it be t

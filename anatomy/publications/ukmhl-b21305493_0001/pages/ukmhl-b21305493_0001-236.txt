94 CELLULAR SYSTEM. of cicatrisation, differs from the ordinary serous membranes in respect that the latter have smooth and polished surfaces, while that of the former is irregular and tuberculated, from the granulations with which it is sprinkled. This irregularity of the granulations, together with their insulated state, may at first appear incompatible with my manner of explaining the early formation of the cicatrix ; blit the following experiment is suffici- ently conclusive of this question. I inflicted a large wound on an animal, and allowed it to run through its various stages, after which it was killed. I removed that part of the flesh which was covered with granulations, I stretched it out on a prominent body, so as to give the utmost convexity to the granulated surface, which in its natural state is concave ; the tubercles then disap- peared, and the provisionary membrane of which I have spoken, being drawn out, it might have been mistaken for an inflamed serous mem- brane. From thence it follows, that as soon as granula- tions are united the air is denied all access, and what has generally been asserted of its contact is contrary to truth and to the laws of nature, who is better skilled than we are with our external coverings, in protecting the divided part at the commencement and during the progress of ci- catrisation. Such are the general phenomena of this pro-

486 VASCULAR SYSTEM I have occasionally made the same observation, either by irritating them externally or internally. In two or three instances, however, an evident contraction appeared to me to take place. On the other hand, as the veinous fibres have only a longitudinal direction, and they are but spa- ringly distributed, it is evident then, that ad- mitting them to be muscular, the effect caused by irritating substances when applied, although real, cannot be ascertained without the utmost difficulty. The question then is not fully re- solved, although I am much more inclined to believe that veins are not possessed of irritability. As the venae cavae at their origin are provided with fibres evidently fleshy, it is also evident that in this part they are possessed of the contractility we are now examining. A further proof of the non-existence of sensi- ble organic contractility in veins, or at least of its obscurity, is that, it is never found increased in diseases. Every organ possessed of this pro- perty is remarkable for its frequent excitement, which in the heart produces the strong and rapid pulse, in the stomach vomiting, in the intestines particular diarrhoeas, in the bladder incontinence of urine, especially in infants, &c. But the veins never display a disturbance which, corresponding to these, might induce us to admit of the exist- ence of a power of which it would be the climax, if I may be allowed the expression.

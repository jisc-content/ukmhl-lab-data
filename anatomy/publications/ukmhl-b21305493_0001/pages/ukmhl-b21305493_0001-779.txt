CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 6,ST quainted with the intimate structure of this im- portant organ, as I shall endeavour to prove, by the description I have previously given, how we may at will accumulate more or less blood in the lungs of the animal, according to the method adopted for its destruction. No other organ in the economy displays, at least in so striking a light, these excessive va- rieties of obstructions in the lungs at the instant of death, because, without doubt, there are none which like the lungs form a central point for cir- culation ; I do not even, as I have said before, except the liver. In this respect, those who dis- sect and examine the state of the lungs, should be particularly careful in distinguishing pro- perly obstruction proceeding from the disease, from that produced by impediments to circula- tion, at the last moments. I will suppose two cases of pulmonary disease, perfectly similar in their nature, their progress, and the subjects they affect; if one of these subjects die in syn- copy, and in the other, on the contrary, death be attended with a long continued agony, and the rattling in the throat, the lungs in the latter will weigh considerably more than those of the former. It is highly probable that, during life, the lungs are likewise obstructed in various degrees. We are conscious, that in the greatest part of the chronic diseases that affect this organ, whenever

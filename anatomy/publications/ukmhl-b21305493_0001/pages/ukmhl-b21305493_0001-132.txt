GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XC11 The first volume of this work will be entirely devoted to the consideration of the general sys- tems, of what I would call the generating systems, if I might be allowed the expression, systems which do not sustain such an important office as to require that every organised part should be possessed of all the six. In effect, some are without arteries or veins, others without nerves; some have very little cellular tissue ; but they serve to form the greatest number of parts, and some are always to be observed, while others are deficient. Thus in tendons, cartilages, &c. which are deprived of blood, we find exhalants and absorbents, &c. In general it appears, that the two systems of exhalants and absorbents are the most universally diffused. Nutrition demands them ; this function, in fact, results from a double motion, the one of composition, which conveys substance of nourish- ment to the organs, the other of decomposition, which conveys it away from the organs. The ex- halants are the agents of the first motion, and the absorbents of the second. As every organ must be fed, and as the mechanism of nutrition is every where the same, those systems must necessarily belong to every organ. Next to them, the cellular system is the most generally met with, sometimes in those parts which are destitute of blood vessels, and invariably in those which are provided with them. The arteries and veins rank next in the order

VASCULAR SYSTEM 494 system, by the gradual contraction it undergoes, constantly supplies that of the veins with a cer- tain quantity of blood. This new fluid, added to that already existing, causes a general motion. Now, as the whole veinous system is constantly full, it naturally follows that, whilst the fluid enters on one part, it should flow from another, or the parieties of the veins would be dilated ; but as they are capable of resistance, and are, even to a certain degree, capable of acting over the blood, this fluid, unable to cause a dilatation in the veins, flows towards the heart. The impulse, however, produced by the im- perceptible contraction of the capillary system is not sufficiently powerful to be suddenly extended from one extremity of a vein to the other, parti- cularly in those parts where the blood ascends against its own weight* In proportion- as the blood enters these vessels, the weight of that which had preceded not being overcome, a gene- ral distention would ensue, and the fluid could not be returned to the heart; but this effect is coun- teracted by the valves which at intervals sustain the column of blood. Weakness of the veinous parieties, and the existence of valves, are insepa- rable. If veins were as strong as arteries, not being calculated for much dilatation, when the blood enters them they would, although deprived of valves, necessarily transmit the surplus to the

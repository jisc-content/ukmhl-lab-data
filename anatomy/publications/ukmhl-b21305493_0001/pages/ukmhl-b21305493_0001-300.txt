But it does not follow from this, that the medullary sub- stance of the nerve may not concur, through the means of the evaporation of its watery substance, in producing the yellowish hue. I will adduce a general remark relating to this, and which ap- pears to me interesting. It is, that water performs an essential office in respect to the whitish appear- ance of numberless membranes, which assume a yel- lowish or greyish hue when this fluid is withdrawn, and again resume their natural colour by its addition. Thus, by means of dessication we can render yel- low all the fibrous organs, the skin, &c. and restore them again to their primitive colour.

162 NERVOUS SYSTEM 6thly. All kinds of acids, if they are strongly concentrated, harden the brain in a very sensible degree, at the very moment of immersion; the sulphuric then softens it, and if not weakened, would reduce it in a pulpous state. The nitric will only, in hardening it, tinge it of a yellowish hue : it is less affected by the muriatic. The phe- nomena produced by acids in these nerves are tolerably analogous in the soft ones. In those provided with a very distinct theca, the process of hardening, of which it is the seat, conceals every phenomena that occurs in the medullary substance. When the theca becomes softer and fuses, this substance has appeared to me to dimi- nish in consistence, and to be changed by acids, whilst that of the brain still preserves the same degree of hardness, provided the concentration has not been carried too far. Every one is acquainted with the effects of alcohol upon the brain, which it also hardens. This hardening the result of acids, of boiling of alcohol, is a phenomenon of which the anatomist can avail himself, by giving to the parts that he dissects a degree of consistency that will enable him to examine them accurately. He makes the cerebral substance approach to albuminous fluids. I say approach, because very essential differences still exist between them, with which I conceive we are rather imperfectly acquainted. The ac- tion of alkalies is quite different to that of acids on

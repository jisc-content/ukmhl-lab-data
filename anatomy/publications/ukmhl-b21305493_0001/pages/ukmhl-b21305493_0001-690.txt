CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 518 lary system where the blood predominates almost exclusively ; others, in which it is circulated in common with different fluids; others, in short, where these fluids only are met with. Of the Organs in which the Capillary Vessels contain Blood only. It appears, that in the muscular system, in the spleen, and in some parts of the mucous surfaces, as in the pituary membrane, the blood in the ca- pillary tubes predominates to such a degree as nearly to exclude every other fluid. Very few other vessels are demonstrated by fine injec- tions ; the arteries and veins being very abundant in these parts, the blood, or at least its colouring substance, is there found, as I shall notice in two different states; on one part it stagnates, and thus serves to colour the organ ; on the other, it circulates and contributes to its nutrition, excite- ment, &c. Of the Organs in which the Capillary Vessels contain Blood and other Fluids. These organs are most numerous in the animal economy. The bones, the cellular tissue, the se- rous membranes, part of the fibrous system, the skin, the vascular parieties, glands, <fcc. present this distribution in a very striking light.

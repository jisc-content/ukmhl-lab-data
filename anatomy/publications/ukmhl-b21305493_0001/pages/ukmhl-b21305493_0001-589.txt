The branches of veins unite to form a certain number of trunks that join those directly intended to pour the fluid into the right auricle ; these trunks are the internal jugulars, the iliacs, the azy- gos, the subclavians, &c. They are still less curved than the branches; like the arterial trunks they are deeply situate ; distant from exterior injury, from which they are secured by a number of organs, because their hemorrhage might be at- tended with the most fatal consequences. The trunks, branches, divisions, and ramifica- tions do not always necessarily arise from each other in the manner we have described. The smaller branches frequently unite with the trunks, the ramifications with the branches, &c. as occurs in the arteries. The angles of union vary : sometimes they are right angles, as those of the lombar and renal veins, &c.; at other times they are obtuse, as those of the intereostals; most generally they are acute. The disposition of the small and large branches varies in the veins, at least as often as in the ar- teries ; they partake in this respect, of that cha- racteristic irregularity peculiar to the organs of internal life. Thus, the general position and the distribution of the branches, &c. only should be attended to; in respect to their union-

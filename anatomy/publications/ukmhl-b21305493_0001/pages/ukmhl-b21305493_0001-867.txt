After extirpation, when some too deeply situate could not be reached^ they are seldom found of a carcinomous nature. Whenever the cancer returns, it is the wound that has opened again. 3dly. 1 have frequently compared the tissue of the gland in the arm-pit affected by a cancer in the breast, with those of the bronchial glands in phthisis, with the sub- hepatic glands, also tumefied in cases of steatoma, of hydatides in the liver, &c., but never found any difference. 4thly. In fine, every professional man who diligently attends dissection, may easily convince himself, that in almost every disease of the organs that are surrounded with a number of these glands, they become tumid, let the disease be what it may. I have myself been so far struck with this phenomenon, that for some time I at- tributed the depositions, in which almost every organic disease terminates, to the obstruction the lymph meets with on crossing those glands. The non-existence, however, of these tumefactions in diseases of the heart, attended with dropsy, the frequent absence of swellings in the superior ex- tremities coinciding with the axillary glands ob- structed the infiltration of the inferior parts, the

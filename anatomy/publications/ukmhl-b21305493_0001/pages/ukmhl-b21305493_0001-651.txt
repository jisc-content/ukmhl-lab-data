A greater quantity of blood is not conveyed by the arteries in this than in the preceding instance. It is somewhat analogous to the varix of aged subjects. ARTICLE V. Remarks on the Pulmonary Artery and Veins. Although in the statement I have given of the systems of the arterial and veinous blood, I have considered the pulmonary artery as forming a part in the veinous system, and the veins of the same description as continuous with the arteries, yet their nature is perfectly distinct. In reality it is only the two general membranes, forming the great canals, in which are contained the two kinds of blood, that are every where of a similar nature, from the general capillary system to that of the lungs.

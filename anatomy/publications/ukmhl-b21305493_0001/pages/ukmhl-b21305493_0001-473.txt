331 OF THE II SD BLOOD. which is never observed in the remainder of its course. 4thly. In respect to the action of the different agents, as air, water, caloric, &c. it seems to be every where the same, and perfectly similar to that effected on the proper membrane, with this distinction only : in small arteries it has seemed to me that the common membrane is more liable to shrink, which, on this account, wrinkles in different parts within when a whole ramifica- tion is plunged in boiling water, a phenomenon that does not occur in large trunks. From this, it is evident that the common mem- brane in the system of red blood, although not every where continuous, is not of an uniform structure. We shall have occasion to make a si- milar observation in respect to the two general •v mucous surfaces. In the corpse, the internal surface of this mem- brane is moistened by an unctuous fluid, met with in more or less considerable quantity. Does this fluid exist in the living subject ?—is it intended to secure the arterial canal from the impression of the blood ? it is difficult to determine : no organ fit to produce it has been investigated ; it might be at- tributed to the exhalants, as several authors have admitted it really exists. It might, however, be the case, that this fluid is merely a transudation after death, similar to that of the bile through the vesicle, or the result of some serous fluid remain- ing in the arteries after the blood has been expelled* f f 2

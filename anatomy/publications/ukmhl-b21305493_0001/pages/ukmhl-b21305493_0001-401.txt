In affections of the heart, of the intestines, of the bladder, &c., there is nothing resembling tetanus; all these considerations form marked distinctions between the cerebral nerves and those of the gan- glions ; distinctions of which I can only speak superficially, since nothing is advanced respecting the functions of the latter. SECTION IV. Dev elopements. In the first stage of life ganglions differ essen- tially from the brain, their developement being much slower than that of this viscus. They have only the same degree of progression with the other organs, whilst the brain, in this respect, as we have ascertained, supersedes them all. In comparing the superior cervical and semi-lunar ganglions in the foetus with those of the adult, this remark is easily made. In the foetus, the

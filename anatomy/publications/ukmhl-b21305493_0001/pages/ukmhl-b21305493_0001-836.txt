694 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. the thoracic duct, includes all those proceeding' from the lower extremities, and from the abdo- men, those of a part of the chest, and of the left side of the upper parts. The absorbents of the right side of the upper parts, both of the head, as well as of the extremities, and a few of those of the chest, contribute to form the other. These two principal trunks open into the vena cava superior ; around these several small vessels also resort to this trunk. However slightly the quantity of absorbents distributed throughout all our parts be examined, the enormous disproportion in capacity, when compared with that of these two trunks, will, as I have previously stated, be easily conceived. How then can it happen that the whole of the serum spread over the serous surfaces, or contained in the cellular tissue, all the residue of nutrition, medullary juices, synovia, that every kind of liquid, and the whole produce of the solid food, incessantly admitted into the torrent of circu- lation, must, before they can reach it, flow through such very minute tubes ? Authors have been struck with this observation. I confess it is a question replete with difficulty. In fact, 1st. When a disproportion exists between the blood vessels, where the diameter is reduced the rapidity increases, and compensates for the difference ; thus, although the capacity of the veins exceeds that of the pulmonary artery, the whole of the blood

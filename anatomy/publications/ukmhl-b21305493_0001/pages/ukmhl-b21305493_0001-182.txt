40 CELLULAR SYSTEM. flated. Injections of melted gluten into the cells may also be employed ; but the results are not so certain, because in passing from cell to cell it frequently breaks the tissue, and besides, after it coagulates it is a very difficult thing to separate each individual portion contained in the cells. All the different cells communicate with one another and in such manner, that the cellular tissue is actually permeable throughout the whole ex- tent of the body, from head to foot. A thousand examples may prove this fact: 1st, emphysema spontaneously produced; 2dly, That, artifici- ally made in a living animal, by inflating the cellular substance, an operation which is not de- structive of life, nor even injurious to the health of the subject although often the whole of the body may be tumefied. It has been ascertained that mendicants have employed these means to excite commiseration, without the slightest pre- judice to themselves. 3dly, If two or three small punctures be made in a dropsical limb, the con- tained fluid will sometimes be completely dis- charged through these apertures ; 4thly, this is also frequently the case where the integuments have given way ; ,5thly, pressure applied to them, causes the fluid either to ascend or descend, ac- cording to the direction in which it is applied ; 6thly, an opening in the bladder, or urethra, will cause extravasation of urine, which sometimes

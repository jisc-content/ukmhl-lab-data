A healthy man that is very corpulent, has a rosy colour, that extends over the integuments dis- tended by fat, and denotes an abundance of blood in the capillary system. On the contrary, in peculiar cases of sudden corpulency attended with weakness, and which takes place subsequent to diseases, when the subject is said to be puffed up, a general pale appearance, coinciding with the na- ture of this swelling, implies a deficiency of blood. 4thly. The mucous exhalations also display a similar phenomenon. I shall afterwards prove that the hemorrhages proceeding from mucous surfaces, are actually exhalations; some evidently are active, a term Pinel has adopted in his noso- graphy: such are, both in the youth and in the adult, the nasal, pulmonary, gastric, and uterine hemorrhages. Now all these, in consequence of the greater quantity of blood that has pene- trated the capillary system, are attended with a local increase of action, with increased heat and a deeper colour of the mucous membrane. We are aware, that Galien predicted an hemorrhage, from the redness he perceived on the nose and eye of a patient ? If, on the other hand, we consider the hemorrhages of the mucous sur- faces Subsequent to long diseases, the hemoptysis which terminates diseases of the heart, the heme- tamesis produced by organic affections of the liver, the hemorrhages of the intestinal canal, so

VASCULAR SYSTEM 31G Membrane peculiar to the Arteries. This membrane is dense light, very apparent on the large arteries, less striking in the last divisons, where it is insensibly lost. Its colour is in gene- ral, every where alike. If in living animals the ramifications have a reddish aspect, and the trunks are somewhat yellow, the difference arises solely from the transparency of the former, which suffers the blood to appear, and from the opacity of the latter. The colour of the arterial fibre is % yellowish: however, in some cases, it assumes a greyish cast. I have frequently observed in ar- teries undergoing maceration, that after a few days it becomes visibly red, or rather assumes a rosy hue, perfectly analogous to that of cartilages in the foetus, or to the fibro-cartilage in the adult, when they have been submitted to the same ex- periment. This result, however, is not so con- stant in respect to arteries as it is to these two systems, wherein it never fails. Sometimes the internal membrane also becomes red, but never the external or the cellular ; on the con- trary, the longer they remain immersed the whiter they become. When the fibrous coatings of arteries have preserved this tint for some length of time, it gradually fades away if mace- ration be continued. This phenomenon is fre- quently more evident in the ramifications than in the trunks. For instance, the arteries at the basis

108 CELLULAR SYSTEM. but its bulk is always considerably diminished. In general, it is upon this swelling, the immedi- ate cause of which is not known, that the abate- ment of the tumour especially depends. Let us proceed to another function, not less important, of the cellular tissue, and which is very analogous to this. ' ' i Influence of the Cellular Tissue in the Formation of Cysts. We understand by a cyst, a membrane in the form of an unperforated sac, which is accidentally developed, and which containing fluids of a dif- ferent nature, has on that account been divided into different species. Cysts are essentially formed at the expense of the cellular tissue ; they origi- nate amidst its cells, expand in every direction amongst them, and borrow all their characters. To be convinced of the influence of the cellu- lar system in the formation of cysts, it is suffi- cient to prove, that between them and the serous membranes there is the greatest analogy, and even almost identity ; for we shall find that these kinds of membranes are essentially cellular. The following are the analogies between these two kinds of productions, the one of which is na- tural, the other accidental. 1st, Analogy in confirmation. Every cyst forms a kind of imperforated sac, containing the

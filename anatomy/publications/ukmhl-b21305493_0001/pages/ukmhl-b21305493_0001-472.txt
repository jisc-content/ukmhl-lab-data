vascular system 330 ternal membrane, which adheres very slightly to the preceding, and can be removed in the form of a tube of some considerable extent. It is dis- tinguished, 1st. By its excessive tenuity and the consequent transparency. 2dly. By its whitish ap- pearance, for it only appeared yellow from being applied over the preceding. 3dly. By the total absence of fibres. It is smooth, and like the serous membranes, has an uniform texture, which may be ascertained by examining it against the light. It differs essentially from these membranes in the kind of brittleness by which it is characterized, breaking and lacerating at the least attempt. All the resistance of which arteries are possessed re- sides in their fibrous tunic. It appears that this membrane, although every where continued, affords, however, in the various regions, some differences of structure. 1st. It is evidently thinner in the interior of the left ven- tricle, than in the corresponding auricle and in the arteries. 2dly. In the heart and in the pul- monary veins, it admits of much greater dilatation than that of which it is susceptible in the arteries, where this, as well as the proper membrane, would inevitably be ruptured if the blood could be determined to them in such great differences of volume as to these organs. 3dly. When the heart has been macerated for a certain time, this internal membrane in the auricle and mitral valves acquires a very remarkable whitish hue,

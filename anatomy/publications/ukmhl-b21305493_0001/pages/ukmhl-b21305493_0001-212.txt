70 CELLULAR SYSTEM. tractile power, its extensibility is also nearly de- stroyed ; in the natural state it is capable of be- ing elongated without rupture, which now takes place from the slightest effort; 4thly. It is gradu- ally dissolved by the continued action of boiling water. I have noticed that at no period of ebul- lition does it assume that yellowish hue which characterises boiled fibre. From the phenomena that are presented by cellular tissue, when exposed to the action of dry and damp air, cold and boiling water, I should in- fer that it is much sooner acted on by the gastric juice than many othersâ€”the muscular tissue for example. The following facts moreover tend to strengthen such an assumption: 1st. Taste which nature has furnished us as a delicate test and safe criterion for judging of the digestibility of food, is much less gratified by the cellular substance that is mingled in our meats, than by the meats them- selves ; 2dly. I have made this experiment upon myself: when my stomach contains a sufficient quantity of food, I can discharge it at pleasure about an hour after my repast; when it contains but little, I cannot so easily void it, but by distending it with a warm fluid, I am enabled to reject it as well as what was before contained in the sto- mach. I have frequently ascertained by these means, particularly the last, that cellular masses intermixed with the fleshy fibre of boiled meat, yield more slowly to the power of digestion than

626 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. and vary in its motions, if I may be allowed the expression, through the exhalants, the excretories, the nutritive organs and the veins; whilst the former having only one single issue, proceeds to it constantly and with uniformity. Let us, then, cease to wonder at the disproportions in capacity existing between the capillary systems. The circumstance of being more or less distant from the heart, is another real cause that contri- butes to maintain harmony between the two sys- tems. In fact, we have found that each contraction of the left ventricle communicates a sudden motion to the whole vascular mass contained in the arte- ries, and that at the very moment this mass is increased on one side it is reduced on the other by the portion of fluid conveyed into the capillaries of the whole body. Thus then, the arterial motion is not progressive, but abrupt and instan- taneous ; thus, at the very same moment the column of the blood in the aorta is increased towards the heart, and diminished in its most remote ramifications, and the fluid expelled from the heart at each contraction only reaches the capillary vessels, after a repeated number of con- tractions, since the part expelled from the heart can only reach these organs after that which has preceded has reached its place of destination. The same phenomenon exists in respect to the dark blood in the pulmonary artery. The greater then the distance, the more time the blood requires

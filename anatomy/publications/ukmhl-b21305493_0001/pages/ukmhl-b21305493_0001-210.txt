CELLULAR SYSTEM. G 8 ance than any other part of the cellular tissue to the putrefactive process. It is the same with maceration as the preceding phenomena. On comparing tendon with cellu- lar tissue, it would seem that water softens the former much sooner than the latter, and yet the one is quite pulpy and reduced almost to a fluid state, while the other is scarcely affected. I have observed no alteration whatever in the cellular sheath of arteries after three months maceration in water, at the degree of temperature common to cellars. Sub-cutaneous, sub-serous, and in- termuscular tissues are much sooner affected, but less in proportion than those of other organs. I have a preparation of nerves, which I have pre- served six months ago in a glass, yet on them, for reasons that I shall explain, maceration has pro- duced no sensible effect; the tissue that sepa- rates its fasciculi, is in every respect as firm and as distinct as before. Cellular tissue yields more easily to the action of water when it is macerated with other organs, which are more soluble and therefore reduce it also to putrescency, than when it is macerated alone. What renders this resistance more remarkable, is the extreme delicacy and porousness of its tis- sue, which must subject it more thoroughly to the action of the fluid. I am convinced that if the tissue of tendons, cartilages, fascia, skin, &c. were prepared in laminae equally fine, and separated

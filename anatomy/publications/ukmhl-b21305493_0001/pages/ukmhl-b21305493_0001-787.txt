EXHALANT SYSTEM. 64b from within, are in fact observed ; but these pores not only transmit the exhalants, but also the ab- sorbents, the hair, &c., as we shall find, in view- ing' the dermoidal system. All duly considered, 1st. The existence of exhalants. 2dly. Their origin from the capillary system of the part where they are found. 3dly. Their termination on divers surfaces, are the only facts correctly ascer- tained. The mode of origin undoubtedly varies, but we are ignorant of the way in which it is performed : the exhalants are connected with their respec- tive capillary vessels, so much so, that it is even impossible to ascertain where the former begins, and where the latter ends. This explains why, in the course of this Work, when mentioning these imperceptible tubes, I have frequently supposed them as proceeding immediately from the arteries, and forming, by their intricate texture, the capil- lary net; it is sufficient if I have made myself understood. SECTION II. Division of the Exhalants. There are three classes of exhaling vessels, distinguished by the fluids or substances they emit.

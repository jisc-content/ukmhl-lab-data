33 CELLULAR SYSTEM. the pericardium are overloaded with it, and par- ticularly the large vessels which it attends for a short distance. The remaining part of the chest which is occupied by the lungs has not so large a proportion. The pectoral tissue communicates with the abdominal: 1st. Through the different openings of the diaphragm, that of the aorta and oesophagus especially, the cellular covering of the vena cava is too closely adherent to this vessel to allow freely of such communications. 2ndly. Through the interstices of the fibres of the dia- phragm, and particularly in the triangular space, which those that are attached to the ensiform cartilage leave between them: this accounts for the passage of pus from the chest into the ab- domen. Desault used to relate a case, in which a collection of matter that had formed originally at the neck, made its way through the anterior mediastinum, and pointed at the upper part of the abdomen. This then explains again the readiness with which the pleuree partake of the diseases of the peritoneum, particularly the right pleura, when the latter is diseased on the convex surface of the liver, which is fixed and immove- able, whilst that which covers the stomach and spleen, being subjected by their motion to a change of situation, exerts much less influence over the left pleura. The cellular communications of the thorax, externally and internally, take place through the

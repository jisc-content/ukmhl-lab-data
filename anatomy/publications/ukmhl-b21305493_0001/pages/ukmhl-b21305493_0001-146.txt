cellular system. 4 dissection, in the middle of the nose, lips, sternum, linea alba, about the spinous processes of the ver- tebra and sacrum, the posterior cervical ligament, Â«fcc. The strength of this adhesion occasions a dis- tinct separation between the two great divisions, of the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue in each half of the body, a separation which I have borne re- peated witness to, in my experiments on emphy- sema. On inflating the integuments of one side of the body with moderate force, I observed in many subjects that the air did not penetrate beyond the median line, so that on one side there was general distention, and on the other the usually collapsed state of the cells. It was often necessary to in- crease the strength of the effort considerably before I could overcome the resistance, and render the emphysema general. We are not however always successful in producing this phenomenon, while, at other times, general in- flation is easily effected, particularly if we blow up the cellular substance above the neck, which is loose anteriorly, as well as at the median line and side. In consequence of the thickness of the sub-cu- taneous cellular membrane being increased at the median line, the body, according to an assertion of Bordeu, in which I concur, is divided into two equal vertical halves. In no other parts, excepting the skin, have we any vestige of such a separation. I have demonstrated elsewhere, in one of mv works, that the division of the body into two

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS* 554 fibrous organs, displays the same phenomenon : why, again, in proportion to the arteries that enter a muscle, or a gland, this will admit of more considerable injections than the former. These observations, which are constant, prove that the capillary system is developed in propor- tion to the functions it has to perform in any part. It forms, in fact, a kind of reservoir, in which the fluids stagnate and oscillate for some time before they serve for nutrition, exhalation, and secretion : whenever these three functions are united, they require more fluid than where one only is performed ; hence, there are more capil- lary vessels. The capillary system, then, is not proportionate to the size of the organs; a narrow part of the pleura contains more of these tubes than a tendon, which is ten times its size. It is the nutritive substance which fills up the vacancy unoccupied by these vessels. These systems, with regard to the develope- ment of their capillary vessels, might, in conse- quence of what I have just said, be divided into two classes: on one hand may be placed the serous, mucous, glandular, dermoidal, synovial, cellular, &c.: on the other, the bony, cartilagi- nous, fibrous, arterial, veinous, fibro-cartilaginous, &c. The first class, in respect to these minute tubes, far exceeds the second. It may also be remarked, that inflammation, the various erup-

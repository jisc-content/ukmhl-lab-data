530 VASCULAR SYSTEM ceases to be secreted : the trunk of this vein is more readily tied under the duodenum than the hepatic artery; but how could it be ascer- tained what was going on within the liver ? Has the opinion been drawn from the fluid in the he- patic duct? But if the duodenum be opened., we shall find in general that bile is not seen to run from the opening of the ductus choledochus, un- doubtedly because the contact of the air has produced irritation, and caused this canal to con- tract. This phenomenon, then, observed subse- quent to the application of the ligature, is not conclusive ; besides, towards the time of digestion, too small a quantity of bile flows through the duct to enable us to appreciate it. Finally, what in- ductions can be drawn from an animal, the abdo- men of which is laid open ? I believe these various reflections will prove that we have not, till this day, a sufficient num- ber of direct proofs to decide to which of the two, the dark blood of the abdomen, or to the red, that the secretion of bile appertains. I ascribe this function no more to the one than to the other; I only say, it must be referred to further exami- nation, and that this instance proves, that the opinions the most generally received in physio- logy, those consecrated by the sanction of all the eminent authors, frequently rest on very un- certain grounds. We are still far distant from those days when the science will be nothing but

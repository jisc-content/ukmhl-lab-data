689 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. Anastomosis of the Absorbents in their Course: In the extremities, the external parts of the trunk, and of the head, in the intermuscular spaces, &c., the anastomosis is very striking. The communicating branches are seen projecting from one vessel to another; so far even, that we might frequently be led to believe these vessels bifurcate, but this is most generally illusory, for each branch of the division is nearly always as thick as the trunk. Under the serous surfaces, as in the convex surface of the liver, of the lungs, of the spleen, &c., anastomosis is much increased: in plates they represent plexuses, for I must confess I have never injected this part of the absorbant system. Anastomosis is produced in the absorbant system.â€” 1st. From one vessel to another that is con- tiguous. 2dly. In the membranes, from the sub-cuta- neous divisions to the intermuscular, and in the organs from the sub-serous divisions, to those situate in the interior of these organs. 3dly. They exist between the absorbents of the upper regions, and those of the inferior. 4thly. Between those that proceed to the

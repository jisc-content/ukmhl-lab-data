Such means, as in local inflam- mation, do not reduce organic sensibility, when increased; such as in oedematious swellings, dropsies, obstructions, &c. do not increase that property when totally diminished; such as in convulsions do not lower vthe animal contractility, or prove ineffectual to raise it in palsies, &c., have essentially failed in their aim and object, nay, they have been wholly misapplied. Into what errors have we not fallen in the use and in the denomination of medicines. When the theory of obstruction was in vogue, the class of deobstruents was founded on it. Next the inspis- sation of humours was broached, and another class—the incisiva as they were called—were in- vented to thin them. At the same epoch, we heard of diluents and attenuants.

OF Tin: KED BLOOD. 359 whatever manner an artery of a living animal be irritated, it constantly remains in a passive state. 1st. It is very easy to make this remark by stimu- lating its external surface with the knife, or any other instrument. 2nd. The same remark is also made when the internal surface is excited, an experiment 1 have frequently repeated, as it is known that the heart is more irritable internally than without. 3rd. When cut longitudinally in a living animal, the edges do not revert as those of the intestines in a similar instance. 4th. Ex- tracted from the body, no arterial tube has ever given the slightest sign of contraction, as the in- testines, the heart, &c. 5th. If, in a living animal, or in one recently killed, the arterial laminae be progressively removed, no vestige of that vi- bration of palpitation experienced in the organic muscular fibres under similar circumstances is ever felt; on the contrary, a kind of apathy, very analogous to that of the tendinous and apo- neurotic fibres, &c., is observed. 6th. It has been asserted, that, by placing the finger on an artery, a contraction is felt. I have repeatedly made this trial, the contraction is infinitely less striking than has been stated. Moreover, it is evidently produced by the contractility of the texture. 7th. La- mere states, that, having intercepted blood in an artery between two ligatures, the parieties, although deprived of the influence of the heart, have continued to contract. This fact is posi- tively incorrect. It was too important that I

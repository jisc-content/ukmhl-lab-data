661 EXHALANT SYSTEM. is frequently expectorated ; this fluid is expelled with the faeces, or hy vomitingâ€™, &c. at the ter- mination of those of the liver ; the whole of the mucous system is never at the same time divested of its powers to such a degree as to exhale blood in its whole extent, it is only impaired in a par- ticular part. What can dispose the mucous exhalants to give out blood in preference to the others ? This appears to proceed from the capillary system from which they arise being habitually per- meated with blood, and the course of the fluid stagnated in the capillaries being near to the mucous surfaces. This is so perfectly correct, -that the parts of the mucous system, which in the natural state contains but a small quantity of this fluid, as those of the sinuses of the face, of the ear, &c. are less liable to hemorrhage. I am convinced that if the exhalants arose from the muscles pouring constantly a fluid over the external part of these organs, hemorrhages would be very frequent in these parts. From what we have just stated, it is evident that the mucous hemorrhages have nothing but the effusion of blood in common with those result- ing from hemorrhoidal complaints, and which al- ways suppose veinous lacerations, or with those produced by aneurisms and varices, or by an inci- sion, a violent fall, &c. They form a class apart

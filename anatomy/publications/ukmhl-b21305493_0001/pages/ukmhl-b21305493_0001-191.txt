itained this fact in several subjects. There is very little of this substance about the kidneys, and that little is hardly perceptible; the other parts of the abdominal cavity are totally unsup- plied. The chest does not seem to contain much more, and always much less in proportion than what it subsequently has. I have also ascer- tained, that the intermuscular tissue is almost every where deprived of it. We might say that the whole of this fluid is concentrated under the skin, at least as long as the foetus thrives. Does this redundance of sub-cutaneous fluid answer any important office ? Is it any way connected with the extraordinary bulk of the liver at that period ? I cannot tell; it is a phenomenon well worthy the attention of physiologists, particularly if we compare it with the total absence of fat in almost every part where it afterwards accumulates. In the adult, there is a far larger proportion of fat in the abdomen than under the skin. Cor- pulency of that part is as rare towards forty as it is common till the fourth or fifth year, at which time of life all the muscular parts being concealed by the superabundance of fat, the body is gene- rally rounded. Has the considerable proportion of abdominal fat in the adult any relation with the frequency of diseases of which this cavity is the seat at this time of life? The proportions of fat however in various stages of life are not so ge- neral but that they admit of many exceptions.

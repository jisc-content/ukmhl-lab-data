CELLULAR SYSTEM. 32 cellular tissue, exclusive of that which belongs to the spinal column. This tissue is most remark- able about the sides of the neck, where the lym- phatic glands are seated. We find also a large quantity in the space between the sterno cleido mastoideus and the trapezius, where wTe observe the origin of the brachial nerves, and the course of the vessels proceeding from the chest. It com- municates with that of the chest, through the large aperture at the superior part of that cavity ; hence, when any of the cells of the lungs are ruptured, the air that escapes forces itself from the chest into the neck. Hence too, the facility with which the same effect is produced in blow- ing up the cellular substance, underneath the pleura, &c. &c. The cellular tissue of the neck communicates also with that of the superior extremities both above and below the clavicle ; this is the reason why the neck, and subsequently the chest, fill with air, water, or any other fluid that is in- jected into the sub-cutaneous tissue of the ex- tremities, and particularly the intermuscular. Cellular Tissue of the Chest. \ In the cavity of the thorax, it is particularly at the median line that this tissue is found ; the space that divides the two mediastina is abundantly supplied therewith ; the neighbouring parts about

OF THE RED BLOOD. 341 on this account would necessarily be thicker in that part. The cellular texture forms the first membrane of arteries, and furnishes, as we have seen, points of insertion for the arterial fibres, but does not plunge in the interstices of these fibres ; it is this very circumstance that essentially distinguishes the layers of the arterial texture from those of the muscular and veinous systems. Whatever means I have made use of to ascertain the existence of cellular texture in those parts, I could never succeed in making it obvious. Ma- ceration, so frequently mentioned by Haller, proves nothing of the kind. Whenever arteries, after a very considerable space of time, have finally given way to maceration, they afford nothing more than a kind of pulp that has no- thing of the cellular appearance. The re-solution of organs into cellular texture by maceration, displays a less striking phenomenon than is commonly conceived. It is this same or- ganic texture that forms the kind of pulp that is produced. As this texture varies in every sys- tem, so does the pulp of those systems that have been submitted to maceration for a long space of time, equally vary, which undoubtedly would not be the case, if, as Haller has stated, the cel- lular texture were the only basis to which every organ is referred by maceration. But let us return to the arteries. The fibres of these are not composed

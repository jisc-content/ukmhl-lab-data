By what mechanical process does each organ collect the materials of its nutrition from the common source, the blood? This depends solely upon the quantity of organic sensibility proper to each, which, giving it a disposition for parti- cular substances, exclusive of others, causes it to appropriate them to itself, to impregnate itself with them, and afford them free passage into its vessels, while it contracts and shrinks from contact with others which are foreign to its tissues. When one of these substances has concurred for a certain time to the formation of the organ, it has then nothing more to do with it, and be- comes heterogeneous ; its further abode wTould be prejudicial, and therefore it is absorbed and thrown out by means of the different emuncto- ries; being replaced by a new substance of a similar nature, and furnished by the exhalants. Every organ is then habitually composed, and decomposed: therefore this composition and decomposition vary in proportion. The preponde- rance of the former over the latter constitutes bulk. The due and steady equipoise of the two, ensures the stationary and settled state of the body, which is exemplified in the adult. When the activity of the second supersedes that

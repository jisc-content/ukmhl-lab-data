OF THE RED BLOOD. 399 auricle, where it is prevented from mixing with the preceding by the upper margin of the fora- men ovale; from this auricle it proceeds to the ventricle ; this transmits it to the pulmonary ar- tery, which sends a small proportion of this fluid that is returned to the left auricle by the veins of the same name, but which transmits almost the whole through the arterial canal in the descend- ing aorta below the origin of the carotid and subclavian arteries, in which the first species of blood circulates. This is conveyed by the branches and ramifications of the aorta into the capillary system of the abdomen and of the inferior parts; the residue is afterwards expelled through the umbilical artery, and lost in the placenta. From what we have just stated, it follows, that notwithstanding the continuity of the two great vascular systems in the foetus, there exists, during the first months of conception, a kind of separa- tion of the blood they contain, that there are, as it were, two systems quite different from those that will afterwards exist separately in the adult. The first of these systems derives its origin, 1st, from all the capillaries of the abdomen, of the inferior parts, and even of the placenta; 2dly. Its common trunks below, are the inferior vena cava, and above the| four-fold branch named the aorta ascendens ; 3dly. The left side of the heart is its impulsive agent; 4thly. It

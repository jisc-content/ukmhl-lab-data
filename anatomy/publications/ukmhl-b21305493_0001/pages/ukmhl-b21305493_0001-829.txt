ABSORBENT SYSTEM. 687 every canal which, like those of the economy, ad- mit of extension and contraction, and it explains why they necessarily baffle every calculation in respect to capacity. These varieties in the absorbents are not ge- neral as in the veins, in which vessels, the large trunks for instance, are simultaneously dilated whenever obstruction exists in the lungs. Here it is sometimes a single branch, at other times se- veral are increased in diameter, the others re- maining contracted. In some instances, the dila- tation in a part is general, the same vessel often displaying an astonishing disproportion in its ca- pacity ; although it has received no branches, one part is double the size of another. Authors have been much at a loss how to as- certain the capacity of the thoracic duct. At this I do not wonder, for it is never found twice the same. These variations do not proceed from the constitution of the subject, but solely from the functions, and from the state of these func- tions at the instant of death. Whether in these variations they are dilated at the upper part or contracted in the middle, or the lower part ter- minates in a swelling, termed by some the re- servoir of the chyle, &c., they are constant dur- ing life, according to the quantity and nature of the lymph, and the obstructions it has met with in its course in any part. In a hundred differ- ent subjects we shall find a hundred varieties in

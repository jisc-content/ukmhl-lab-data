358 VASCULAR SYSTEM system, or to those that attend the vessels, without apparently providing them with filaments, or to those of the system of the ganglions, that are irregularly distributed, and in a considerable num- ber, on their external surface. 5th. To remove all matter of doubt in this respect, I have chosen the most powerful mode of excitation—galvanism. It was in vain that the cerebral nerves were armed on the one part, and, on the other, the arteries annexed to them ; the contact of these two opposed points did not produce on the arte- ries the motion it excites in the muscles to which these nerves proceed. The result is the same when the nerves of the ganglions are chosen for the experiment; on the one hand, I have excited the superior part of the mesenteric plexus, on the other, the arteries of the same denomination, pre- viously divested of their serous and cellular coats ; the contact absolutely produced no effect what- ever. The arterial system, then, does not possess that motion which the action of the brain is ca- pable of producing. All that has been written by different authors, particularly by Cullen, on the nervous power, on the action of the brain in the arterial system, is vague, illusive, and contrary to experience. Properties of Organic Life—Sensible Organic Contractility. Sensible organic contractility is very evidently wanting in the system we are considering. In

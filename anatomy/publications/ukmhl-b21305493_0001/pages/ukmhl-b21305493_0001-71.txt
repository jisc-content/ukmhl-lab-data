GF.NEK A L CONSIDER ATIONS. XXXI others to decomposition. The solids are the boundaries where the former which are produced from without terminate, and whence the latter which are expelled from within depart. Fluids of composition or decomposition are not all perfect- ly distinct: the chyle, matters conveyed through the medium of the skin, the principles which the lungs borrow from air, &c. belong only to the first order. Secreted fluids, and those exhaled from mucous membranes and the skin, appear to be- long exclusively to the second. The blood is a common centre, in which those elements that are admitted, and those that are expelled, are blended indiscriminately together. Let us now consider what part the fluids and solids sustain in vital phenomena. This part evi- dently depends on the properties with which they are endued: thus, in reflecting on the na- ture of the vital properties we are acquainted with, it is evident that all pre-conceived ideas of fluids must be dismissed from the mind; that they can never be the seat of any contraction ; that organic and animal sensibilities are in no way connected with the state in which their particles are found, &c. I think it needless to speak here of the pretended spontaneous motion of the blood, the subtle fluids it contains, ac- cording to some, and which dilate or contract it as occasion may require. All this is but a series of vague ideas, that no experience ha* vol. 1. D

NLRVOUS SYSTEM 1 GO do not appear susceptible of being hardened in any way. This is made very striking when the two last are dipped in boiling water, or in a con- centrated acid, &c. In respect to the first, it is ascertained in submitting to the same experiment the soft nerves, in which the theca is hardly dis- tinct. To this also must be attributed the fol- * lowing phenomenon :â€”when the anterior part of the optic is immersed in boiling water, the theca shrinks, its canal contracts, and the medullary substance not shrinking in proportion, flows to- wards the extremities, which become swelled. As this substance in the other nerves is in a smaller proportion, this phenomenon is less strik- ing ; however, it does take place; and to this cause must be attributed the same round tubercles which the terminations of nervous filaments pre- sent when boiled. It is the medullary substance that forms these swellings. This phenomenon is very remarkable in the spinal marrow7, which be- ing immersed in boiling water, suffers its com- pressed substance to escape through its extremi- ties, or the apertures that are made in any part of its covering. Thus, when the head is boiled, the dura-mater separated from the cranium is strongly contracted, or becomes harder, compresses the cerebral substance, w7hich not being contracted in a similar manner, ruptures the former, so as to become diffused within the space formed between the skull and dura-mater, in the process of boil- ing.

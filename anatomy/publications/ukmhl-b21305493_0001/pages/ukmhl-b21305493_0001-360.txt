NEUVOl'S SYSTEM 218 nent anatomists evidently prove it. What is the mode of such re-production ? However little we examine the results of these experiments, it will be easily perceived that it has nothing peculiar in respect to the nervous system, that it is a sim- ple cicatrization analogous to callus in bones, to the cicatrization of the skin, &c. When a nerve has been divided, its two extremities inflame, the cellular texture it contains shoots forth new parts in virtue of the re-productive property which we have acknowledged it to possess; these parts coming in contact, contract adherences that re- unite the two divided parts of the nerve. As the cellular membrane, which is the uniting means, springs forth in the divided extremity of the nevrileme, so also does that which is intermediate to the cords; it partakes of the nature of the theca, and becomes a parenchyma of nutrition, whose mode of organic sensibility is analogous to that of the nerves, and whose vessels on this account deposit within it the medullary substance, which gives the nervous cicatrice a new appearance, and renders it similar in a tolerable degree to the very texture of the nerve. However, as the vegetations arising from the divided parts are not produced in a regular manner, there never can exist at the point of contact that same regu- lar filamentary disposition as in the nerve itself: thus the canal of a long bone, although ana- logous to that bone, is never so regularly disposed

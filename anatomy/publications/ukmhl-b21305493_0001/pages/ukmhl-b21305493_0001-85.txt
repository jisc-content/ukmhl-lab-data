general considerations. xlv strongest alcohol is but a mean agent in producing this effect when compared with the latter. Not- withstanding it contracts the tissue of the parts by degrees, condensing and twisting them at the same time. In making anatomical preparations we therefore take especial care to reduce our alcohol to 26 or even 24 degrees. 4thly. Neutral salts, by absorbing the moisture of animal sub- stances, likewise condense them and harden thein in a remarkable degree after a lapse of time. 5thly, When atmospheric air has removed by desi- cation all the aqueous particles of solids, if the lat- ter are still exposed to its action, they will shorten themselves, shrink, and curl up in a slow and in- sensible manner. 6thly. Alkalies, in whatever strength employed, will never produce any con- traction. 7thly. Water seems to operate in an inverse way to this contraction, dilates and ex- pands the soft parts by maceration, so that their particles become separated ; it is only when it contains much caloric that it is equal to produce such contraction. This phenomenon takes place some degrees under the boiling point, and is well marked at the actual point of ebullition. The different agents of which I have spoken produce then two kinds of contractions : 1st, one instantaneous and almost similar to the motion which springs from the irritation of a living muscle ; 2dly, the other slow, progressive, and even imperceptible.

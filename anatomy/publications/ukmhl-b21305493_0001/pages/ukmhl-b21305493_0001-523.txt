381 OF TIIE RED BLOOD. blood, on being expelled, will correspond to each contraction of the ventricle. Now', if arteries, by contracting, were intended to convey the blood to every extremity, their contractions and ex- pansions would unavoidably alternate with those of the heart; but if this were the case, each pulsa- tion of the arterial supply should correspond to the dilatation of the ventricle, whilst, as I have stated, it is quite the reverse. From this we may conceive how very incor- rect was that opinion generally received, and which I had myself professed for several years, namely, that the auricles contracted with the ar- teries, and the veins with ventricles. The circu- lation of the red blood was explained in the fol- lowing manner: 1st. The pulmonary veins pro- pel the blood into the left auricle ; 2dly. This, by contracting, impels it into the ventricle that dilates to receive it; 3dly. The ventricle then contracts and forces it into the aorta, that is di- lated at the moment of contraction ; 4thly. This also contracts to distribute it in all parts of the body. This last action does not take place. I defy any one ever to observe it, as the others, in a living animal. Let us examine as closely as possible a large artery laid bare, it will rise, but hardly dilate in its natural state ; neither is it seen to contract but in a slight degree. Contrac- tion of the left ventricle, general motion in the arterial blood, and the passage of that fluid into

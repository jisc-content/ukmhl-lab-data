C GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. in the substances therein deposited. Animal che- mistry has, within a few years, thrown so much light on this point of doctrine, that it is idle to dwell longer on it, or to attempt farther refu- tation of what has been written respecting the identity of the nutritive juices. Finally, it is easy to comprehend in what way each parenchyma of nutrition appropriates to itself, according to its degree of organic sensi- bility, the nutritive substances which are suited to it, and which the tide of circulation conveys to it. This is not a phenomenon peculiar to nutrition, it is observable in every act of organic economy. Accordingly, secretions operate only in virtue of a determinate degree of sensibility, which adapt- ing each gland to the fluid it secretes, enables it to receive that fluid and reject others ; thus, the red part of the blood does not commonly pene- trate into the exhalants, because it is the serous part only that has any relation with the degree of their organic sensibility: thus substances con- veyed through the intestines will never enter into the ductus choledocus, or pancreaticus, although the diameter of these ducts exceed that of their globules: thus the cantharides act ex- clusively on the sensibility of the kidneys, and mercury on that of the salivary organs, &c. &c. From these considerations, it is plainly seen, that the process by which the parenchyma of nutri- tion appropriates to itself the nutritive substances,

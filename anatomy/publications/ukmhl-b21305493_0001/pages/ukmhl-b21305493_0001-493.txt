OF THE It ED BLOOD. 351 are not calculated to yield at all ; when the cause of dilatation acts gradually, it will produce its effect to a limited degree, after which the part ruptures. The proof of this exists in the frequent dilatations at the arch of the aorta, in those which take place in the first stages of aneurisms, &c. In the longitudinal direction, arteries admit of more considerable distensions than in the preced- ing ; we might be convinced of this on drawing out these vessels to apply the ligature in an am- putated stump. On cutting, in the dead body, a part of an artery, and drawing it in a contrary direction, it becomes evidently elongated. In performing these experiments, the developement of the curves should not be overlooked. In fact, I have said that this acted the principal part in the extension of the arteries situate in parts that undergo dilatation. It is evident that the extension operates trans- versely, it is the circular fibres of the peculiar membrane that afford the chief resistance ; on the contrary, in the opposite sense, it is the common membrane that opposes the resistance, since these are not longitudinal fibres. This clearly explains why the first mode of extensibility is less'striking than the second. Contractility. This must also be considered in the opposite significations.

596 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. the materials for nutrition, exhalation, and ab- sorption, and is also met with in all organized beings. We cannot conceive any without it, because none can be conceived that are not con- stantly composed and decomposed by the process of nutrition. In consequence of all that has been hitherto stated, it is evident that the blood on reaching the capillary system is no longer circulated but by the tonic influence of the solids. Now, as the slightest cause will alter or change their proper- ties, it is liable in this circulation to experience a number of irregular motions. The slightest irri- tation will make the fluid retrograde or advance — deviate to right, to left, &c. In the natural state, its motion is generally uniform from the arteries to the veins; but it is every moment exposed to meet with causes of irregular motion in its extensive anastomosis;—this proves, as we have seen, that anastomosis could not be dispensed • with. These irregular oscillations in the motion of the capillary circulation are perceptible to the eye when assisted with the microscope. Haller, Spallanzani, and others, have frequently observed them in their experiments, which are too familiar to need repetition. In animals possessed of red and cold blood, in which subjects they had irri- tated the mesentery, or any other transparent part, they have seen the globules move forwards and backwards, and in a number of contrary directions. In animals possessing red and warm

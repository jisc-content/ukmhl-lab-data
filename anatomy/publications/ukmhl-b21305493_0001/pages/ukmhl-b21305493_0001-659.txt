5H OF THE DARK BLOOD. lure superior to that of any other veins; but, on due investigation, I have convinced myself it is absolutely the same. The cellular coating of a peculiar nature that clothes it, and which is analogous to that of the other vessels, is only somewhat more characterized; which, at first glance, gives these veins rather a thicker appear- ance ; but, on removing this cover, the internal membrane is found of the same nature, but less capable of being extended. The longitudinal veinous fibres are not so easily discerned as in the preceding system. I even doubt if they exist in the trunks, where they might be better observed. Both the hepatic and abdominal portions of this system, appear absolutely uniform in their structure, only the first is every where attended with a kind of membrane, that seems cellular, but whose nature has not, till this day, been pro- perly investigated, and known by the name of the capsule of glisson. This capsule, intimately united to the substance of the liver, is less at- tached to the veins; so that when these are empty, they are frequently separated from it to some distance, which causes them to collapse when the liver is cut in slices. The object of this anato- mical disposition is, I believe, still unknown. The similarity of structure between the abdo- minal and general veinous systems, implies also, a similarity in the properties, sympathies, the af-

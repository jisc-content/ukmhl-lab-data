551 CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. mined: its whitish appearance is often instanta- neously converted into a deep red, because then the blood fills a number of tubes through which it did not previously circulate; these vessels are very distinct to the naked eye ; we perceive that the blood circulated in this membrane is con- tained in vessels, and by no means infiltrated. By way of example, 1 shall produce those or- gans in which the surfaces are not attached, be- cause the state of the capillary system is ascertained with more facility in these, although the others would afford the same phenomenon: we should find the cellular tissue in some of the fibrous organs, &c. &c., when compared, on one part, in animals dissected alive ; on the other, in the state of in- flammation, or after proper injections,. disclose a much smaller quantity of vessels in the former case than in the latter. It may then be esta- blished as an indisputable fact, that, in a number of organs of the animal economy, the general ca- pillary system is, in the natural state, partly sup- plied with blood, and partly with other fluids of a whitish appearance. The proportions vary considerably. As I have before stated, the capillary system in the serous membranes hardly contain any blood ; that in the skin is rather better supplied ; the mucous sur- faces still better, &c. : but let that connection be what it may, the difference in the capillary sys- tem still exists.

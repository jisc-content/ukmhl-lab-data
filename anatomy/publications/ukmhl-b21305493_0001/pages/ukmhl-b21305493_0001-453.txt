311 OF THE RED BLOOD. to the motions in the last division, that the slight- est alterations they experience occasion number- less obstructions, rendering indispensable the anastomosis, which is precisely very much mul- tiplied at the extremity of the arterial tree. On the contrary, the vitality of the trunks having hardly any influence on the circulating fluid, this is less liable to be obstructed in flowing through them: anastomosis, therefore, which is here very rare, can be more easily dispensed with. If the slightest cause, the least irritation, were to produce spasms in the trunks, as they do in their last divisions, it would have been requisite that they should communicate together as fre- quently. A fleshy texture in the large arteries and vital properties, analogous to the involun- tary muscles, would unavoidably have caused nu- merous anastomoses, because various causes in- fluencing these kinds of muscles, they might, at every instant, increase, against the laws of nature, their contraction, reduce their channels, and limit the progression of the circulating fluids. Forms of the Arteries in their course. Several physicians of this age have consi- dered each artery as forming a cone, whose basis is towards the heart, and whose summit is directed towards the extremities; but if an artery taken

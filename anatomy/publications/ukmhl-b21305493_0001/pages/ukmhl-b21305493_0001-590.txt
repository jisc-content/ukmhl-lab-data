VASCULAR SYSTEM 448 with the trunks, there are nearly as many clis tinctions as subjects. Forms of the Veins. The same observation in respect to the forms of arteries, is applicable to the veins. 1st. A trunk, a branch, &c. is cylindrical, when a part which receives no small branches is ex- amined. In the dead body they seem compressed; this proceeds from the fall of the parieties, from the absence of blood, but on being expanded, either by injection or inflation, &c. they re-assume their primitive shape. In the living subject, they appear circular. 2ndly. When viewed in some considerable ex- tent, a branch of the veins appears of a conical figure, with the basis directed towards the heart, and the summit towards the general capillary system. This form proceeds from the successive addition of smaller branches, which gradually increase its capacity as it approaches the heart. 3dly. Considered as a whole, the veinous sys- tem represents three trunks, two of which cor- respond to the superior and inferior venae cavae, the third to the coronary vein : the summit of these three trunks answers to the auricle, and the basis rests in the general capillary system. Ana- tomists have thus figured to themselves the as- semblage of the veins, because, as in the arteries.

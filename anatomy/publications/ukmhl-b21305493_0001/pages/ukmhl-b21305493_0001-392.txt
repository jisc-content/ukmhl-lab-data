NERVOUS SYSTEM 250 show that it does not possess the slightest linear or thready appearance. Homogeneous, in some mea- sure, in its nature, when cut in slices, it presents, throughout, an uniform aspect. The -celebrated Scarpa, however, has considered ganglions as re- sulting from a kind of expansion of the nerves, into an infinite number of very thin filaments, which interweave with each other, and become very distinct by maceration. I have not repeated all those dissections, which have appeared to me extremely difficult to perform. I shall refer then, to his work, and to the plates which he has added to it. I shall merely observe, that the ganglions, most undoubtedly, must contain something more than a single re-solution of the nerve into very thin filaments. In fact, the slightest glance suf- fices to establish betwixt them the utmost diffe- rence undoubtedly; a distinctive line should be drawn between ganglions and their nerves, as between those of the brain and of this substance. 1st. Difference of colour—being reddish and grayish in some, white in others ; 2dly. Differences of con- sistence, of exterior qualities, &c.: 3dly. Difference of properties. If the nerves proceeding from the marrow merely expanded into very thin threads in their way through the ganglions, this would only constitute a diversity in the form, and by no means in the nature,—the properties would be the same. Why, (as I shall afterwards prove,) are they so

336 VASCULAR SYSTEM have already had an opportunity of observing, identity of affections implies indentity of na- ture. It is the frequent ossification of this mem- brane in the heart of the elderly subject, that renders the intermittent pulse, so common at that age. The ossification of the origin of the aorta influences also the circulation, which I have had frequent opportunities to ascertain, but those of the trunks, ramifications, &c. do not occasion the least disturbance. The ossification of the common membrane in the system of red blood differs essentially from those formed in other parts, as in this; it is in some measure a natural phenomenon, whilst in the others, it is accidental, and frequently preceded by obstruction and inflammation. Thus, such ossi- fications never follow the progress of age; they are as frequent in the youth and the adult as in old persons. Before this last stage of life, the ossification of the membrane may be discovered, but not so frequently as at that period. The diseases of the heart, attended with and frequently consisting solely of the ossification of the mitral valves, are remarkable proofs of this. I have frequently been struck with a phenomenon in this respect: such ossification, as in the elderly subject, does not endanger life, but only occasions an intermittent pulse^ in the adult is attended with the most fatal consequences. I have already opened several subjects, affected with great diffi-

VASCULAR SYSTEM 334 continued solid tube, so that the membranous parts remaining between them may be considered as fulfilling the office of articular bands, and that arteries thus ossified, are composed of numerous pieces, moveable the one over the other, and en- abled, in some degree, to aid the circulating mo- tion. As long as these layers remain thin, the interior of the artery is, as usual, even and smooth; but if some considerable quantity of the saline sub- stance has been deposited, they then become thicker, and project inwardly. The thin pellicle that covers them, and which is continued on the artery, breaks on a level with their circumference, and then they adhere only by their external surface to the proper membrane. Their circumference, on this account, is rough and uneven. If there are a great number on the artery, the whole internal surface exhibits a thousand asperities, produced by the laceration of this excessively thin pellicle of the common membrane that covers the ossified layers. This disposition is particularly remark- able at the origin, and even in the course of the aorta. I have frequently seen it in our dissecting rooms. Since practising in the hospitals, I have already dissected three or four subjects similarly affected, and who, although the heart was per- fectly sound, had died, however, with the greater part of the symptoms that characterize the dis- eases of that organ. The laceration of the thin

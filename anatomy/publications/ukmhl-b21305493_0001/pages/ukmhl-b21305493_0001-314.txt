NERVOUS SYSTEM 172 creting organ of this medullary substance, which filtrates, in some measure, through its parietes, to become afterwards stationary in its cavity. This I cannot admit of; 1st. Because in this case, neither the olfactory nerve, nor the posterior part of the optic, could be nourished. 2dly. The ce- rebral membranes have nothing to do with the secretion of the pulp of the brain * they only transmit such vessels as are intended to deposit its substance. 3dly. The same disposition is ob- served in respect to the spinal marrow, the pia- mater of which bears so much analogy to the theca. The vessels traverse this membrane, and are then lost, as I have already mentioned, in the medullary substance, which they constantly renew ; so that if it were possible to remove this substance without injuring the vessels, their ex- tremities would be found floating in the canal of the pia-mater. Thus, in certain fungouses of a very soft nature, the vessels are observed to cross in every direction the very substance they deposit in the interstices, and would form a kind of net- work, if we could strip them of this substance. 4thly. In the optic nerve, the vessels are evidently not confined to the theca ; they penetrate be- sides into the canals it forms, and are lost in the medullary substance. Every thing, then, concurs to prove that the theca is no more the secretory organ of the ner- vous substance than the pia-mater is of the cere-

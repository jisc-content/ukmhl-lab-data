XC1V GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. their central organ, which is the heart, the cellu- lar tissue, exhalants and absorbents, display this phenomena in a striking manner. It is also strik- ingly visible in the nervous, arterial, venous, and cellular systems; in the two others, it is proved by the astonishing activity of absorption and exhalation at this time of life. The idea I have just given of the general systems in the oeconomy, will clearly convince us that they act the most important parts in nutrition. They form the nutritive parenchyma of every organ: thus I give the name nutritive parenchyma, to the cellular, vasculous, and nervous canvas, that composes the organ. It is in this very canvas that the nutritive matter is deposited. This matter dif- fering in every organ, has peculiar characteristic features. In the bones, it is the phosphate of lime and gelatin; it is gelatin only, in the cartilages, ten- dons, &c.,fibrine in the muscles, albumen in certain other organs; so that if the nutritive parenchyma of a bone admitted fibrine, it would become a muscle in the shape of a bone ; and on the other hand, a muscle would be a bone in a muscular form, if its parenchyma were incrusted with earthy and gelatinous substance. We should be acquainted with the nature of all the living parts, if we could ascertain their nutritive substances, but the major part are yet unknown: it remains to the province of chemistry toenlighten usonthishead. All organs

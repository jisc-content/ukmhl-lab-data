Who does not know the little efficacy that dwells in emollient and discutient ap- plications recommended for tumours in the breast, in the glands of the groin, arm-pit, &c.?â€”who does not know that they will as often subside without our applications as with them ? Formerly, when- ever a tumour made its appearance under the skin, though it were seated in the abdominal viscera themselves, and separated from the integuments by different and even opposite tissues, medical men were wont to cover it with a cataplasm. In modem surgery we recognize the inutility of such applications, and merely avail ourselves of such as act on the organs that are most sub- cutaneous. We shall one day perhaps be suffici- ently acquainted with the properties and actions of each organ, to be enabled to judge when the cellu- lar tissue may be made the medium of communi- cating the effects of medicines between two con- tiguous organs differing in structure and proper- ties, and when it is the barrier where the commu- nication of these effects receives a check. Till then we shall wander frequently in doubt and darkness. An application to the skin will often act

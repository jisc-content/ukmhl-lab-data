CELLULAR SYSTEM. 113 cavity, and pus leaving the external surface to invade the parietes of that cavity, and it will form a cyst. In like manner, suppose a superfi- cial cyst, whose cavity is obliterated, and the fluid transuding through its external surface, and we shall find a suppurating tumour. Since then, form only constitutes the difference between a tumour and a cyst, why should not the production of the latter be similar to that of the former? Besides, have we ever imagined that the formation of external and internal tu- mours can be attributed to compression ? It is necessary then to conceive that cysts are pro- duced in the following manner. They first ori- ginate and are developed in the midst of the cel- lular organ, by laws very similar to those of the general growth of our parts, and which appear to be aberrations, unnatural misapplications of these fundamental laws with which we are unacquainted. When once a cyst is characterized, exhalation begins at first sparingly, and subsequently, it in- creases in proportion to its progress. The growth of the exhaling organ then invariably precedes the accumulation of the exhaled fluid, in the same manner as in other cases, the quantum of sup- puration in a tumour is in a direct ratio to its bulk.

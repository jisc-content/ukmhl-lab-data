OF ANIMAL LIFE. 225 has smaller arteries. It is the same in respect to the viscera of the pelvis, where the arteries being very diminutive, can only admit a small quantity of blood, which does not enter into and dilate them, until the umbilical arteries are closed. The volume of the cerebral and gastric arteries on the contrary is very considerable. The increase then of the nerves is perfectly independent of that of the parts in which they are distributed. The olfactory nerve, whose organ is so contracted in the foetus, has the same proportion as the optic or the auditory, whose organs are already con- siderably expanded. It is the same in respect to all the nerves of the voluntary muscles ; their in- crease is uniform, although the muscles vary in size according to their situation. If, without re- garding situations, the nervous systems, the cere- bral and muscular in animal life, be examined in a comparative and a general light, it will be per- ceived that the first essentially predominates, whilst, in the male adult, the muscles propor- tionally to what they were in the foetus, have the preponderance over the nerves by which they are supplied. The par vagum, which pro- ceeds and ramifies in organs whose growth is not in the same degree, present, however, the proportion that is afterwards seen in its divers branches. These opposite dispositions of the arterial and nervous cerebral systems, prove, on the one hand,

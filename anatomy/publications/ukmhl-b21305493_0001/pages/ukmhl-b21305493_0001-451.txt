OF THE RED BLOOD. 309 The second mode of anastomosis is that of the large branches with others that are smaller. Of this there are very frequent instances* particularly in the extremities; it admits of no varieties. It is almost always in parts distant from the heart that anastomoses are met with. We hardly ever find any in the trunks that proceed from the aorta; they begin to be frequent in the branches* as in the mesenteric* the cerebral, &c. The more the ramifications subdivide, the more they are multiplied. In the ultimate ramifications they are so very numerous as to form an inextri- cable net-work. This position of the vessels is intended to facilitate circulation in those parts where the course of the blood is liable to be obstructed. It is on this account that* in cavities which are left sensibly affected by the motion of the neighbouring parts* anastomosis is more frequent, as in the brain* the abdomen* &c.; whilst it is less common in the muscular inter- stices of the limbs* &c. The arterial system, then* cannot be compared to a tree with insulated branches* but one in which all the parts communicate with each other* and the more frequently in proportion to their distance from the trunk. The principal object of anastomosis—that of compensating for the obstacles the blood meets with in its course—is fulfilled in numerous in- stances. Thus, after tying a wounded artery,

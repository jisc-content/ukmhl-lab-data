117 CELLULAR SYSTEM. his organs, which by this cause are disguised; from thence partly the suppleness and multipli- city of his motions; from thence also proceed the frequent diseases to which at this period he is liable. The laminae still continue excessively thin; they are still very apt to be torn. In producing emphysema in very lean infants, I have observed that considerable dilatations frequently take place in different places, a kind of pouches where air accumulates in a considerable quantity, and which only proceeds from such lacerations, whilst in the same experiment in the adult, the air is uniformly diffused, and fills the cells regularly without causing them the least injury. In comparing in our butche- ries the veal that has been inflated with that of oxen in the same state, I have sometimes been led to make the same observation. In infancy and in youth, the vital energy of the cellulary texture is particularly striking ; at that age the granulations, which are essentially cellular, as we have seen, arise with greater ra- pidity, and go through their usual process in a shorter time than at any other age. The lips of wounds unite more readily, and every tumour in its developement and course bears a stamp of rapidity which proceeds especially from the high degree which the vital forces of the cellulary sys- tem have attained in the infant. To the same

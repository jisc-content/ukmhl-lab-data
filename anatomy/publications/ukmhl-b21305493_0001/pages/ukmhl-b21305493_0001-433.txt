291 OF THE RED BLOOD. at present I shall satisfy myself by mentioning them, to prove that the dark blood is a general reservoir into which a variety of substances may enter, either naturally or accidentally, and subse- quently disturb the functions by flowing with the circulating mass. The humoral pathology has undoubtedly been exaggerated, but it is founded on solid principles; and in many cases it cannot be doubted that all the phenomena may be re- ferred to a vitiated state of the fluids. From all that has hitherto been stated, we may conclude, 1st, That the essential part which the circulation of the dark blood enacts in the econo- my, is to impregnate that fluid with various new substances. 2dly, Thaf on the contrary, that of the circulation of the /xf>lood is to distribute its constituent principles. The one progressively increases, the other decreases in the same pro- portion : to distribute is the attribute of the first, to receive is that of the second. This discovery, which is strictly supported by truth, and founded upon the simplest observation, appears to me of importance, and assists in establishing the distinc- tion that I have adopted with respect to the gene- ral circulation. The state of health supposes a perfect equili- brium between the abstraction of the red blood and the addition to the black. Whenever this equili- brium is destroyed the consequence is disease. If the dark blood receives more than is given off by

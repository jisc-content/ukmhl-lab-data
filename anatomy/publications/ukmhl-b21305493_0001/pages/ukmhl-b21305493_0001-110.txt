lxx GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Let us compare the sharp burning pain of erysipelas with the throbbing pain of phlexmon, or the pain of rheumatism with that of an in- flamed lymphatic, &c. We shall also perceive that the sensation of heat produced by inflamed tissues has a distinct and individual character; in one case it is acute and cancinating: in another, it is analogous to that excited by the outward ap- plication of heat, &c. &c. There are two gene- ral causes which occasion the variation of symp- toms in diseases : 1st. The nature of the tissue af- fected ; thus, as I have stated, the inflammation of each, gives rise to a different sensation of pain 2dly. The nature of the disease. It is well known, that cancer, whatever be the structure it destroys, is attended by a pain peculiar to itself; that ve- nereal and scorbutic pains, &c. are also peculiar, being modified to a certain degree in each tissue. The diversity of tissues, not only modifies the nature of symptoms, but also influences their du- ration. Nothing in this respect is so vague in the practice of physic as the words acute and chronic, as applied to inflammations of the various tissues. In the majority of cases they run their course, ra- pidly, in the cutis vera, celullar, serous, and mu- cous tissues, &c.; their progress is, on the other hand, slow, in the bones,cartilages, and fibro-cartil- ages. We may apply the preceding distinction with some propriety to the same tissue, as, for instance, inflammations of serous, or mucous membranes, and

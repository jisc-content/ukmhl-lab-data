67 CELLULAR SYSTEM. tissue has been boiled, without any other organ, excepting the vessels with which it is supplied, as, for instance, that of the scrotum. I have made this experiment myself. Different substances, however, operate differently on this tissue to their usual mode of action on the skin, cartilage, fibre, &c. When exposed to air, the cellular tissue dries quickly, but does not assume the yellowish hue peculiar to fibre : it remains white. When dried in laminae of a moderate size, the cells adhere to each other, and the laminae being somewhat dis- tended for the purposes of dessication, have the appearance of a real serous membrane when the process is completed. In this state the cellular membrane is quite pliable, and bends every way with the utmost facility. It has not the stiffness of dried fibre, and when immersed again in water, does not perfectly resume its first ap- pearance, and its cells are with difficulty unra- velled. Submitted to putrefaction with other animal substances, it does not yield so readily as some of the latter, as, for instance, the glandular and muscular parts; when distended with the juices of putrefaction, it is not so quickly decomposed as the other parts by some space of time. This fact is particularly striking in the sub-mucous tissue, or that which surrounds the vessels; the filaments of which it is composed offer much more resist-

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 631 the kidney affected by inflammation, and in a healthy state. This phenomenon evidently proceeds from the lungs receiving alone as much blood as the whole body, and more blood being therefore accumu- lated in a given time when its course is deranged by the process of inflammation. To speak more correctly, however, it is not with blood that the lungs in these cases are found to be gorged: when expelled by pressure, the fluid appears white ; it seems to be a kind of pus. Much has been said of imposthumes subsequent to this disease ; but these cases are extremely rare : the lungs, in almost every instance, are infiltrated; the fluid does not collect in a sac. Does the blood, in pulmonary inflammations, penetrate vessels that were not originally in- tended to circulate this fluid, as may be seen evidently on the serous surfaces, on the tunica conjunctiva when inflamed, &c. ? I believe not; because no other vessels have been discovered in the lungs besides those intended for the blood. It seems evidently to be the blood, or the other fluids, that are deposited in the pulmonary tissue by the exhalants. It cannot be doubted that in peculiar phlegmons the blood penetrates, as I shall prove, into the interstices of the cellular tissue, and it appears to be the case here. By tearing or cutting the lungs, when in a state of inflammation, it is evident that the whole tissue

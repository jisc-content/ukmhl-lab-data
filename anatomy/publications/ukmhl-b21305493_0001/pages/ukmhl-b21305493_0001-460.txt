VASCULAR SYSTEM 318 most always take place in the very substance of the brain itself, in general nearer to the posterior than to the anterior lobe. The cerebellum is very seldom affected. When the annular protube- rance becomes so small, partial effusions, separated by uninjured medullar partitions, frequently take In respect to the arteries in other parts of the body, their peculiar membrane presents a tolera- bly regular disposition. It has, however, appeared to me rather thinner in the interior of the liver, and of the spleen, than in the intermuscular paces, and even in the muscles. This membrane is composed of very distinct fibres, adhering together, but easily separated, disposed by layers in such a manner, that after having removed the cellular covering, these seve- ral layers are separated with the utmost facility; a circumstance that has led several authors to believe, that the principal arteries are composed of a considerable number of coverings. The fibres that compose these layers are circular, or nearly so; those most external seem to adhere to the contiguous dense cellular texture. In fact, on removing this, a more or less considerable number always adhere to it intimately. In respect to the internal membrane, it does not ap- pear to have any attachment; it may be removed with the utmost facility, without carrying with it any arterial fibres. The manner in which these

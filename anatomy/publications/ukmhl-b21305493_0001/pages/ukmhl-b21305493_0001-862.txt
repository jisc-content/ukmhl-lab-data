720 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. related a single case of veinous inflammation caused by the contact of the heterogeneous substances with the membrane of the veins, whilst practice frequently proves this fact in respect to the aborbents. The lymphatic glands particularly have a great tendency towards inflammatory obstruction, when they come in contact with absorbed deleterious substances. At first the effect produced by these substances is limited to the first glands they meet: thus it is that the absorption of venereal infection hardly ever passes beyond the glands in the tetro: thus, also, those of the axillary glands alone be- come swelled subsequent to a puncture with an infected instrument, &c., whilst those further removed remain uninjured. Notwithstanding this excessive tendency to inflammation, the lymphatic glands, however, are much slower in their progress in this affection than many other animal tissues, than the cellular and cutaneous for instance. It has been suffi- ciently proved that phlegmon and erysipelas have gone through their periods in a shorter space of time than the axillary or inguinal glands require in their states of inflammation, &c. The nature of pain in these glands, when inflamed, is very distinct also from that experienced in the above-mentioned affections; it is a dull and ob- scure pain, as it were, and more time is required to form pus, and it might rather be compared to that

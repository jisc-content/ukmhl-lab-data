13 CELLULAR SYSTEM. # in membrane analogous to the preceding, but per- fectly distinct from the adjacent tissue, and which enters into it without partaking of its properties. It forms a distinct body, in density, form, and texture. The filaments of which it .is composed being separated by no interstitial fluid, remain closely applied to one another, so that collectively they form a membrane resembling a sheath that may easily be removed, like that surrounding the arteries; it is in effect thicker than in the venous system. Of the Cellular System considered in respect to the Organs it completely involves. ' * With the exception of the organs just men- tioned, all parts of the body are completely sur- rounded by a covering of cellular substance, more or less extensive > forming, as Bordeu has so happily expressed it, a peculiar atmosphere for eachâ€”an atmosphere in which they are en- tirely immerged, that insulates them from other organs, and destroys to a certain degree such communications as have a tendency to connect them intimately, or to identify their existence one with another, provided they were brought into immediate apposition. The serous vapour that habitually penetrates the cellular atmosphere of every organ, the adipose substance, that is there floating in more

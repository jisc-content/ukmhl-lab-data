XIX general CONSIDERATIONS. &(% Medicines, then, are not only intended to increase or decrease the energies of the vital powers, but also to restore them to the natural harmony from which they had departed. What I have just said applies also to the strictum and to the laxum of several physicians, who have only these two objects in view. The strictum may be judiciously applied to inflam- matory phenomena; the laxum to dropsies, &c.; but what manner of connexion have these two states of organs with convulsions, disorders of intellectual functions, with epilepsy and bilious affections, &c. ? It is the especial fault of those who have a general idea in physic, to make every phenomenon conformable to that idea. This vice of generalising too much has, perhaps, been more hurtful to science than that of considering phe- nomena in a distinct and isolated manner. The series of considerations I have unfolded suffice to demonstrate, that every where in the physiological sciences, in the physiology of plants and vegetables, in pathology, therapeutics, <fec. it is the vital laws which preside over the innu- merable phenomena about which these sciences are conversant, that there exists no one single phenomenon which does not flow from these im- portant and fundamental laws as their source. If we were to examine the different branches of physical science, we should find that the physical laws are the final principle of all their phenomena;

VASCULAR SYSTEM 32 4 veina porta, which, in its distribution, is ana- logous to arteries. Why is the pulmonary artery thinner and less resistant than the aorta ? Be- cause less fleshy, the J^fejventricle is only calcu- lated for less violent exertions. From what has just been stated, it appears that the external arterial membrane approaches the fibrous organs, which, as we shall perceive, are characterized by an excessive resistance. But if we consider that this membrane can be lacerated into parts, removed in layers and scales, that in dissection it is elastic and even dry, if I may be allowed the expression, whilst in fibrous organs all is intimately attached , forming a solid body, re- sistant but softer, and less capable of contraction, we shall then be convinced that this external membrane is exclusively peculiar to the arteries; that it is unconnected with the other systems, and forms in the economy a distinct and insulated texture. The texture formed of regular fibres, is, in my opinion, the only circumstance that could induce us to believe in the muscular nature of the arteries; but ligaments are equally fibrous, so are tendons: what have forms to do with in- timate nature ? Can we then say that the nature is the same when the physical properties, the extensibility and contractility of the texture, the vital sensibility and contractility differ so essen- tially ? Besides, the action of the various re-active

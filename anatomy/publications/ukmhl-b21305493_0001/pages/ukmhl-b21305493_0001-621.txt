OF THE DARK BLOOD. 479 character of a number of the other tissues of ani- mal economy, and are, in this respect, essentially distinct from the arteries, which, as we have ob- served, are very elastic. Their vital powers, and the properties of their tissue, will now be particu- larly considered. section r. Properties of the Tissue.â€”Extensibility. Veins, in regard to this property, are quite op- posite to the arteries, which allow of tolerable extension in the longitudinal direction, but scarcely any transversely. Veins are susceptible of but little extension in the first direction. When drawn in the ampu- tated stump, or in the dead body, although ac- tually extended, they are not elongated in pro- portion to the dilatations they undergo in varices. This may, perhaps, be less owing to the deficiency of extensibility in the tissue than to the curva- tures being less numerous in these vessels than in the arteries, which are consequently longer. However, let the reason be what it may, the fact is not less certain. Few organs, on the contrary, are so susceptible of being extended in a transverse direction as the veins. In the dead body, by injections of air,

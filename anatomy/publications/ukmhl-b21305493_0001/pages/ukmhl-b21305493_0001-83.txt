xliii GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. sort of struggle, if I may be permitted the ex- pression, which takes place in the vessels between the living fluid and that which is not yet ani- . maiized. Thus we perceive solids contract and shrink as it were from a stimulus which is new to them. Who can tell if the vitality of fluids does not influence their motions ? T think it highly probable. I doubt much if fluids purely inert could, were they to exist alone in living vessels, circulate in them like the living fluids. By the same reason, fluids animated with the vital principle could not circulate of themselves in vessels without it. Life then is equally indispensable to both, but these subjects are too obscure to occupy us further. section v. Of Properties independent of Life. These are what may be called the properties of tissue. They are non-existent in inert bodies, and inherent in the living ones, and depend on their texture and the arrangement of their particles, but â€¢ . in nowise on their living power. Death does not destroy them ; they adhere to organs when life has forsaken them, yet are increased in energy by it. They are only destroyed by putrefaction or the decomposition of matter. These properties are extensibility and the contractility of texture. I have sufficiently described them in my u Trea-

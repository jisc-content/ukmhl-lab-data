Thus in every organ composed of many tissues, the one may be impaired without disorder of the others ; this is indeed what happens in the greatest number of cases. Let us take the principal organs for example. 1st. Nothing: is more rare than affections of the substance of the brain, or more common than inflammation of the tunica arachnoides, which invests it: 2dly. A single membrane is often diseased in the eye, while others continue healthy in their structure. 3dly. In spasm or paralysis of the muscles of the larynx, the mucous mem- brane remains entire, and inversely, when the latter is affected, these muscles perform their functions as usual. Morbid states both of its membrane and muscles, are exclusive of the cartilages, and vice versa. 4thly. In the structure of the pericardium, we observe numerous morbid appearances, while the substance of the heart is without a blemish, as also in the structure of the latter without derangement of the former. The ossification of the valves or coats of arteries does not disease the neighbouring parts. 5thly. When the membrane of the brouchia is the seat of inflam- mation, the pleura isbut little affected thereby, and on the other hand, in pleuresythe former is scarcely ever touched. In peripneumony, though we find considerable effusion in the thorax after death,

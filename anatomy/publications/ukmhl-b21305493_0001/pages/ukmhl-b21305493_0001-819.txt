ABSORBANT SYSTEM. 677 tually composed and decomposed: now the ex- halants answer to this first nutritive motion, the absorbents are intrusted with the second. We may remark, in fact, that the internal substances are never returned into the circulatory torrent to be subsequently expelled but by means of the absorbents. The nutritive absorptions then differ from the preceding;, inasmuch as the substances deposited . f<st: by exhalation and taken up by them stagnate in the organs, and contribute to their composition, whilst the fluids submitted to the internal exhala- tions and secretions, after having been produced by the one, and before they are taken up by the other, stagnate on the external part of the organs, over their surfaces, or in their cells, but without con- tributing to their structure. It will perhaps be found difficult to conceive, how solid nutritive \ substances can possibly be absorbed by such very small tubes. Hunter, to whom anatomy is so much indebted, in respect to the absorbents and their intended purposes, has already resolved this question and removed the objection. To what he has advanced may be added, that the distinction between the solids and the fluids exists only when they form a mass ; but that when alluding to their divided particles, they do not differ from each other : this is so perfectly true, that the very same particle will alternately form a part of a fluid or of a solid, such as in

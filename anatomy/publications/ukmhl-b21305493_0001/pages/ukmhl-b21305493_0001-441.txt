OF THE It ED BLOOD. 299 teric artery, this projection is very remarkable between the branch that is given off and the continuation of the trunk : it forms a kind of semi-circular point, but between the trunk itself and the branch that arises from it, the union of which produces an obtuse angle, it is not well defined. The more this angle is obtuse, and the more acute consequently the opposite one, the less evident is this projection ; like the other it is semi-circular, and unites with it to form a complete oblique circle; so that the position it represents is nearer to the heart than that which is represented by the other prominence. 3dly. If the angle of origin be acute, and con- sequently that formed by the branch with the continuation of the trunk be obtuse, the arrange- ment of the parts is reversed : there is then at the mouth of the artery an oblique circle, of which the most prominent half is nearer to the heart than the other. The origin of the arterial trunks is in general pretty uniform ; but that of the branches varies so much, that it is scarcely ever found alike in two subjects. Let us take for example the hypo- gastric. It would be impossible to form the slightest idea of its branches, if, without regard- ing the manner in which they are given off, we attend only to their course and distribution. These innumerable varieties of form are re- markably characteristic of organic life, to which d d 2

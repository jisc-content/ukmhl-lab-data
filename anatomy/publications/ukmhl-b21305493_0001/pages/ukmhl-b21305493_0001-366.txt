NERVOUS SYSTEM 224 it predominates ; and finally, in the very origin of each pair, where its proportion in respect to the theca is strongly marked. In all the other nerves, this examination of the medullary sub- stance is attended with much more difficulty, be- cause the sheath that contains it is as much, or even more, developed in proportion, than it will be at a subsequent period. This explains why nerves have already acquired so much hardness and resistance at that early period, why they can sustain proportionally very heavy weights. Ma- ceration in water at a moderate temperature, in- creases that resistance as it does in the adult, and renders it very hard, without augmenting its volume. It might be said this fluid acts upon the theca in a manner different to that which it pursues with other animal substances; finally, it also softens it, and it dissolves. The blood vessels are proportionally much more considerable in the nerves of the embryo than in those of the adult. Thus the whitish appearance of the latter has a livid tinge, proceeding from the kind of blood by which they are supplied. It is the very same phenomenon which occurs in the brain. The developement of the cerebral nerves in the early age, displays a phenomenon which dis- tinguishes them essentially from those of the ar- teries. In fact, these always increase in propor- tion with the parts to which they proceed. Thus the face', more imperfectly formed in the foetus.

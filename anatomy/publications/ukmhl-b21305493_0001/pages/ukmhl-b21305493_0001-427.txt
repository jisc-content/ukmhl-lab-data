This consequence naturally leads to the follow- ino*: As the red blood has a much longer course to traverse from the heart to the general capillary system than the dark blood has from this viscus to the capillaries of the lungs, it was necessary that the portion of this organ belonging to the former should be endowed with greater power than that intended to maintain and perpetuate motion in the latter. Nature has fulfilled this end by providing the left ventricle with a much greater number of fibres than the right. With re- gard to the auricles, as they are merely intended to receive the blood and transmit it to the ven- tricles, with which they form, in some measure, but one body, their thickness is nearly uni- form. From this we perceive, 1st, That the part which the heart enacts in both circulations, relates di- rectly to the mechanical phenomena of the course of the blood, and that if it exert any influence over the composition of this fluid, it can only be by the internal motion that is imparted to it : 2dly. That if the course of the two circulations were less extensive, they might dispense with this intermediate impelling agent. This is precisely what takes place in the venous system of the abdomen, the two trunks of which distributing

CAPILLARY SYSTEMS. 594 ' been noticed. Nutrition, on the contrary, is excessively variable ; particular parts being* deve- loped at different periods, and receiving conse- quently more nutritive substance at another, it is a different organ. This variety is the first and most essential phenomenon of growth. How, also, could the formation of tetters, of various eruptions, &c. that arise in particular parts, be reconciled with the sole and uniform impulse of the heart? Would inflammation display such varieties in its nature, according to the system affected, if produced by the action of the heart only ? All the distinctions between catarrh, ery- sipelas, phlegmon, &c., would disappear; none would exist, but what take place either more or less in the vicinity of the heart. Let us, then, cease to consider this organ as a sole agent, presiding over the circulation of the large and the small vessels; as conveying the blood in large quantities into a part, and giving rise to inflammation; as producing by its impulse the various cutaneous eruptions, the secretions, exhalations, &c.: the whole doctrine of mecha- nicians rested, as is well known, on the very extended motions that were attributed to the power of the heart.

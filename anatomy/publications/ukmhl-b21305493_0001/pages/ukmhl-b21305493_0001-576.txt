434 VASCULAR SYSTEM times a more or less extensive space separates them, as in the muscles, nerves, &c. Besides the origin of veins corresponding to the terminations of arteries, there is a class of veins that separates from the arteries at their exit from the general capillary system. This class is particularly remarkable in the external parts of the body. Every organ so situate, is seen to produce,â€” 1st. Veins that resort to the internal parts to attend the arteries; others that proceed externally, become sub-cutaneous, and form trunks that will presently be noticed. In several internal organs, the same division of veins is observed. From this general disposition, it follows that the veins arising from the capillary system, are more numerous than the arteries that proceed to it. This is the principle of the disproportion in the capacity existing between the system of the red blood, and that of the black, a disproportion that will afterwards be considered. Veins frequently communicate in their origin; a number Lof minute patches, proceeding from their intermixture, ^e. seen in parts that will admit of their being perceived, as under the serous surfaces, &c. c/J- Ao- St v/ a

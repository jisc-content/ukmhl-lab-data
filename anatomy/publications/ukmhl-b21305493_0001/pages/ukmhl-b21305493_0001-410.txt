NERVOUS SYSTEM 268 weaving of the organical nerves at their exit from the ganglions exhibit a mass of irregular nerves imbedded in the cellular membrane, accommo- dated to the forms of the neighbouring organs, and very distinct from those of animal life, as the brachial, the lombar, &c. In fact, at every mo- ment the filaments not only, as in these, are placed next to each other, and exchange their connections, but their extremities are also con- tinuous ; they interweave together, incessantly change their direction, form angles, forming plexus of net work, so intermixed that it is not possible to distinguish any thing more than a mass of nerves, which appear to spring up be- neath the cloth that wipes the part in which the plexus is situate. These organs are remarkable for their reddish, or greyish hue, for their softness, and particularly for their manner of being nearly concealed, &c.; it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish them from the cellular membrane. The best method to make them evident, is to open the subject, and macerate it for a day or two in water ; they will then whiten sensibly, will not soften, but on the contrary, seem to acquire a tolerable degree of firmness, as those of the brain, in similar cases; besides their tenuity is such, that it is impossible to submit them to any kind of re-active ; I have only observed, that they possess, in an eminent de- gree, the power of contracting, and do not seem

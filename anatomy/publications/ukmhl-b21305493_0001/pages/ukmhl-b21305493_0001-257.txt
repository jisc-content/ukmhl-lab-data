115 CELLULAR SYSTEM. This primitive state of the cellular organ, this appearance displayed in its early stage, are owing to the astonishing quantity of fluid with which it is at that time imbued, and by no means denotes an unorganised state : it may then be com- pared to a vitrified body, which at the first glance appears quite fluid, because the transparency of its laminae do not allow of their being distin- guished ; puncture them however so as to evacu- ate the humour, and they appear. Thus is the cellular tissue observed to be re- markably thin, and actually transparent at that tender age, concealed by the humour it is filled with, and becoming gradually more apparent as this humour insensibly diminishes with age. This phenomenon is sometimes re-produced at a sub- sequent period, whenever the different serous in- filtrations occur, particularly when the infiltrated fluid has a certain degree of viscidity. What can be the nature of that humour the cellular system is so liberally supplied with in the early stages of conception ? Is it of an albumi- nous nature, like that intended to lubricate it at a future period ? This is highly probable. But I am also inclined to think it has much of the gelatinous character, a character which strongly predominates in the animal fluids (as it is well known) at that period of life. I have no experi- ence on this point; whatever this humour may be, it is by far more viscous and unctuous than

306 VASC'UJUAR SYSTEM striking than the single one, which at this in- stant takes place in the brachial artery, and yet the circulation is not impeded. Besides, if one of the intercostal arteries, which is but slightly curved, be opened, the blood is not projected from it with greater force than from the radial, &c. If the whole arterial system were empty, and it were successively filled by blood projected from the heart, it would, no doubt, be retarded by striking against the incurvated vessels. On this account, arteries whose course is tortuous, are not so readily injected, and the spermatic, for instance, remains frequently empty. But in an assemblage of tubes filled with fluid the case is quite different; the shock applied to its com- mencement is suddenly propagated through all the cavities it contains, and not in a succession, as I shall state hereafter. The curvatures of arteries are accommodated to â€¢% the various states in which the organs may be found; they are very striking in those intended to undergo alternate dilatation or contraction : for example, in the intestines, in the lips, and in the whole face. In the foetus, where the testis is in the pelvis, the spermatic artery is very tortuous; when this gland descends the artery unfolds, and takes the direction which it is found to possess in the adult. In the motions of the womb, of the bladder, of the pharynx, of the tongue, &c., these curves act a very important part for the

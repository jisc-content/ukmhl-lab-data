140 NERVOUS SYSTEM limbs hold the first rank in this respect, because the extremities being more distant from the origin of the nerves, these trunks must consequently over-run a tolerable course before they distribute their filaments; on the contrary, in the chest and in the head, as the organs are immediately conti- guous to the nerves intended to penetrate them, the division into branches is more immediate, and the trunks are very short. The nervous trunks are sometimes accompanied with a corresponding arterial or veinous trunk, such as the brachial, the crural; on other occa- sions, as in the sciatics, those of the par va- gum, &c. proceed alone. Nervous Branches, Filaments, 6fc. By degrees, as trunks proceed on, they scatter here and there different branches; these pro- duce divisions, which in turn shoot forth fila- ments, from whence the last divisions arise. All these various divisions form very different angles. The acute angle is more generally met with. This is not a real origin, but merely a separation of several cords united for the branches, of one or two for the divisions, of one single cord for the filaments, and of isolated threads for the last di- vision. Thus is this separation effected higher up or lower down, according to the subject. The part where it occurs is never strictly determined.

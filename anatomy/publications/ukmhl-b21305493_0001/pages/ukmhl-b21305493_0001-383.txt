Now were this the case (as all the nerves continue to diminish in proportion to their distance from the brain) its disposition would be quite opposite ; it would increase in dis- tributing its branches. Could it arise from the spinal marrow ? Then the branches it distributes to one region would proceed from those it re- ceives in that region. Thus the great and small splanchnic nerves would arise from some of the intercostals ; but they are evidently much larger, particularly the former, than the whole of the branches from which they would originate. It may also be remarked, that all anatomists have been of different opinions with respect to the origin of the great sympathetic nerve ; in fact, how could they have been unanimous concerning what does not exist ? These various considerations confirmed the opi- nion I had long entertained, that there is no such thing as the great sympathetic nerve ; that the cord it forms is only a series of communications between small nervous systems placed one above another; and that these communications are merely acces- sory, and might perhaps be dispensed with, as we may constantly perceive between the ophthalmic and the spheno-palatine ganglions, between this and the superior cervical, many instances of which are supplied by many animals. From that time

ABSORBANT SYSTEM, 721 of the cellular tissue, being very distinct from that formed in erysipelas. Few tissues in the economy, subsequent to inflammation, are more liable than this to be hardened ; if, subsequent to erysipelas, the skin become schirrous in one in- stance, the lymphatic glands will be so in twenty. This is, in fact, one of their distinctive charac- ters. The absorbents, as well as their glands, fre- quently display, in a certain degree, a slowness in the progress of those phenomena over which the organic properties preside: for instance, whenever they have been injured in wounds they contract and shrink, and require more time for healing than the capillary vessels similarly af- fected. Hence, the serous discharge that is con- tinued for some time after hemorrhage has ceased, a phenomenon that is invariable in slight wounds 5 but it would certainly not be the case if the ab- sorbents and the capillary vessels were possessed of the same mode of insensible contractility. There are additional proofs of the principles, the consequences of which we so frequently had occa^ sion to produce instances of in the course of this work, namely, that the vitality peculiar to each system imparts to every affection its peculiar colour and aspect, if I may be allowed the express sion, which are foreign to all the other systems.

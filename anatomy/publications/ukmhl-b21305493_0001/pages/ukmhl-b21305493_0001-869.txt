We are aware, that in particular fevers, na- ture selects these glands to form the crisis, they are the seat in low fevers, of what is im- properly termed parotid.

There are certainly sympathetic ab- sorptions, as well as sympathetic exhalations and secretions. On the other hand, it frequently happens that the absorbents being affected, the other organs are affected by sympathy; in the tumid belly, and in the obstruction of the bronchial glands that cor- respond to it, there are a number of symptoms visi- bly arising from the sympathies that connect these glands with the other organs. To point out these symptoms is not my present object. In respect to the influence of the diseases of the absorbents over the other organs, we know but very little. When, after a puncture or a

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. XXV111 ones were continually restrained in the phenomena which they tended to produce ; that the others, on the contrary, always preserve the same modi- fications. Destroy a stone or metal, by breaking the one or dissolving the other, and their particles will remain for ever in the same state. Authors however have already pursued this parallel to suf- ficient extent, we content ourselves therefore with deducing the consequence, already drawn from other facts ; I mean the difference of the laws that govern the two classes of phenomena. But here I must point out an essential dif- ference existing between vital and physical pro- perties : I speak of sympathies. Inert bodies have no communication in their various parts. If we destroy one extremity of a block of stone or metal, by means of chemical or mechanical agents, &c. we shall not find the other parts impaired in the slightest degreeâ€”a force im- mediately applied is necessary to produce a change in them. On the contrary, every thing is so bound and chained together in living bodies, that no portion whatever can be disturbed in its functions without some other immediately sym- pathizing with it. All physicians are sensible of the peculiar consent which exists between all our organs: it exists both in the state of health and disease, but more particularly in the latter. How obvious, how easy would be the study of diseases, were they uninfluenced by the accidents of sym-

The form of ganglions is excessively irregular; in general they are somewhat round ; occasionally they are elongated, and sometimes they form a kind of triangular body with obtuse and rounded edges, as the ophthalmic ; in other instances they are of a semi-lunar form, as that which bears this name, &c. In general all these forms, as I have already noticed, are remarkably variable ; the most constant is that of the superior cervical. Imbedded in a great quantity of cellular tissue, ganglions are separated by it from the approaching organs. Almost every one of them are so situate that they experience but very little motion from these organs, and none what- ever from the blood-vessels that resort there. Those situate along the vertebral column, present in particular this phenomenon very distinctly, both from that which takes place in the brain, whose functions are essentially connected with the continued agitation which is kept up by the motion of the blood in the part, and from that which is observed in plexus of nerves pro- ceeding from these same ganglions.

CELLULAR SYSTEM. 8 mity in a sound state, and stript of its integu- ment and subjacent tissue, with a dropsical limb prepared in the same way, having like the former no other covering but the fascia, and we shall find that the difference between them is but very slight. , Sub-mucous Cellular Tissue. The mucous membranes have the same con- nections with the cellular tissue as the skin, from which they are continued, and with which they have, as we shall perceive, the utmost analogy of structure. There is then a sub-mucous as well as a sub-cutaneous tissue. But this essential differ- ence exists between them, that the texture of the first is infinitely denser and closer than that of the second, and consequently the connection of the mucous system with the neighbouring parts is much more considerable than that of the cu- taneous svstem. To this difference must we refer: 1st. The difficulty of dissecting the mucous mem- branes, and separating them distinctly from the subjacent parts: 2dly. The absolute impossibility in experiments, of inflating the sub-mucous tissue, while all others are easily filled with air: 3dly. The constant absence of air in this tissue, in cases of even extensive natural emphysema: 4thly. Also the entire deficiency of serum in the sub- mucous cells, in the worst cases of anasarca, an essential phenomenon in respect to hollow

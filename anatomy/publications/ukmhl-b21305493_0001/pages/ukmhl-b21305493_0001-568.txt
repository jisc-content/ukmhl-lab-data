426 VASCULAR SYSTJLM quently sought for similar dilatations in those parts of the arteries where the curvature is most remarkable, in the internal carotid for instance, when it enters the bony canal, but could never perceive any. In old age the pulse is remarkably slow: a circumstance quite the reverse of that in infancy, when the blood moves with very great rapidity. These two facts completely opposed to each other, are, from what we have stated, nearly unconnected with arteries: they merely denote the degree of force which the heart, the general impulsive agent of the red blood, is possessed of. It is the same in respect to pulsation in the last moments of life; it is no longer a real beating of the artery, it is a kind of undulation of feeble oscillatory motion, which is the more obscure as life declines. Now, I have ascertained by an ex- periment easily performed, that the heart is the only cause of this undulation, it is this I have laid bare in several dogs, on one part the carotid artery, on the other the heart, by a section of one side of the chest, performed in such a manner that respiration might still be main- tained by the other. By placing the linger on the artery, I noticed that as long as the heart continued its natural beat, pulsation took place as usual, that it was even rather accelerated, because by the contact of air, the contractions of the heart were increased, but after that time, its mo-

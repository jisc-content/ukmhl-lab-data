732 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. principles that contribute to form these fluids, why should not the chyle present the same varie- ties ? it would be different from the other fluids of the animal economy, if its nature did not alter in a variety of instances. Now, from what could these varieties proceed, if not from the lacteals presenting innumerable varieties in their organic sensibility, which will only admit of particular principles, and rejects the others? The absorption of the lacteals, which, in the natural state, convey to the blood nothing but nu- tritive substances, may then frequently leave a pas- sage for the admission of morbid principles. Thus, in the lungs, the vessels that borrow from the air the principles required to colour the blood, are often found to convey principles that prove fatal to the functions, according to the different altera- tions their sensibility may undergo. In the ordinary state, the mode of organic sensibility and of tone in the cutaneous and mu- cous absorbents close every passage to deleterious substances from without; but let this sensibility be altered and instantly the passage is opened again. Does not pus in the greatest part of wounds remain in the cellular tissue ? but if, by some improper application, the power of the ab- sorbents be increased, it is taken up by them, passes into the blood, and the ulcer becomes dry, and hence the whole of the symptoms proceeding' from absorption.

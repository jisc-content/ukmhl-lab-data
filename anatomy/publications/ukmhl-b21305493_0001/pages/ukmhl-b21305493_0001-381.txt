NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ORGANIC LIFE. 239 proceeds; whilst, in respect to the second, there are as many insulated centres, and consequently as many small secondary nervous systems, as there are ganglions. It is well known that all anatomists, even those who, without attributing a strict sense to their expressions, have designated ganglions by the appellation of diminutive brains, have mistaken them for appendages, for swellings of the nerves, in whose course they are found ; and as the greatest part of them are found in the great sympathetic, they have been represented as a distinctive cha- racteristic of this nerve. But from the general idea I have just given of ganglions, it is evident that this nerve in reality does not exist, and that the continued filament which is observed from the neck to the pelvis, is nothing else but a series of nervous communications, a series of ra- mifications which the ganglions, placed in a verti- cal manner, reciprocally exchange, and not a nerve proceeding from the brain or the spinal marrow. The first considerations which induced me to believe that the great sympathetic is not a nerve of the same description as others, but only a se- ries of anastomoses, were the following: 1st. These communications are frequently interrupted with- out occasioning any derangement in the organs to which the great sympathetic resorts. In seve- ral subjects, for instance, a very distinct interval

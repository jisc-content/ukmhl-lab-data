OF ANIMAL LIFE. 231 iiis sensations, are extremely numerous. As sight incessantly presents new objects to the infant, he is incessantly wishing to feel them; his little hands are in a constant agitation ; his whole frame in constant motion. It was then indispensable that the nerves which serve to transmit this prin- ciple, should, like those of sensation, be adapted by thisdevelopement to the continual motion they display. These two things, the great developement of the nervous system, and the frequency of its ac- tion in the infant, explain why diseases predomi- nate at that age. Such at that time is the sus- ceptibility of the brain to answer the sympathetic excitations, that however trivial the pains in any part may be, they instantly produce convulsions, which are at least four times more frequent at this than at any other subsequent age. I have observed, in this respect, that the various systems are (in the different stations of life) more or less disposed to correspond with sympathies, accord- ing as their predominance in the economy is more or less striking. The same morbific cause in any organ, and which in an infant will produce convulsions, by acting sympathetically upon the brain, might, in a young girl, cause a suspension of the periodical discharge, by in- fluencing the womb, which begins to predo- minate; a peripneumony in a strong and vi- gorous youth; in the adult, as the gastric vis-

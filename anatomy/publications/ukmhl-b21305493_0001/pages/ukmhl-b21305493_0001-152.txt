CELLULAR SYSTEM. 10 the peritoneum, pleura, tunica, vaginalis, testis, pericardium, &c. This exuberance of cellular tissue is especially intended to yield to the dif- ferent changes that membranes undergo, to their dilatation, contraction, and their displacement under certain conditions ; for instance, we shall find the peritoneum sometimes belonging to the onsentum and sometimes to the stomach, ac- cording as the last viscus is full or empty. In these cases it is necessary that the neighbouring tissue should be extremely loose; to this must be attributed the facility with which the sub-serous tissue in dropsies fills with water, and in emphy- sema with air. Next to the sub-cutaneous tissue there is no part of the living economy more readily disposed to these unnatural secretions. At particular parts however, the serous mem- branes adhere strongly to the neighbouring or- gans. The pericardium in its two layers, the synovial membrane with the cartilages and fibrous capsules, the tunica arachnoides wTith the dura- mater, afford us examples of this arrangement, that constitutes when the adhesion is with a fibrous membrane, the sero-fibrous membrane. Cellular Tissue external to Arteries. Around the different arteries, we find a strong dense elastic layer, which at first glance appears to be one of its proper coats, but evidently be- k

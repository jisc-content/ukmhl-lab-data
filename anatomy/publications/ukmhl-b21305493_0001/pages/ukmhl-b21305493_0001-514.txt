372 VASCULAR SYSTEM adapted to the carotid of the one, on the side of the heart, and the other to the crural or carotid artery of its fellow, in the side opposite to that organ, the heart of the first, by conveying the blood, will cause the arteries of the second to pul- sate. All my experiments upon death, and which are already published, have presented this pheno- menon. Besides, in cases of aneurism, the pulsa- tion of the artery exists below the tumour ; and yet, here the two ends of the divided artery are separated, the cellular membrane only, by forming a cyst, serves to unite them ; the blood then passes through an intermediate body which is not arterial. 7th. Let us adapt a tube to an artery, let the other end be provided with a pouch formed of skin, or oil-cloth, the blood will instantly fill it; and at every contraction of the heart it will experience a kind of pulsation: thus it is that the tumour of an aneurism pulsates, although es- sentially cellular. Whatever may be the organ that contributes to form the cyst, as long as it re- ceives through the blood the impulse of the heart it will beat in a similar manner. 8th. May I ask whether the active dilatation of arteries would be sufficient to elevate the brain, to impart a motion to the leg crossed over the opposite one, to overcome the efforts of tumours situate in their courses, and which rise at every pulsation? To produce these phenomena, a more

130 NERVOUS SYSTEM from the anastomosis of these pairs, at their exit; then classify the nerves, 1st, Into internals, which proceed to the great sympathic ; 2dly, Into exter- nals, which are distributed upon the acromion and in the triangular space,â€”bounded on the anterior part, by the sterno mastoideus, and on the poste- rior part, by the trapesius; 3dly, Into anterior, which, being reflected upon the sterno mastoideus, form there, with the branches of the fatcial, a kind of superficial plexus ; 4thly, Into posterior, which proceed either to the occipital or to the posterior muscles of the neck ; 5thly, Into those which pass downwards, as the diaphragmatic, those which communicate with the angular division of the hypoglossal, &c. &c. In this manner you will easily retain all the nervous distributions; because instead of having as many centres as there are pairs, you will have a single point to which the memory may refer the whole. Interior communication of the Nervous Cords. It is not only at their exit that the spinal nerves communicate in this manner. The different cords which constitute each, exhibit in every7 respect the same disposition, which is very easily ascer- tained in the large trunks, as in the median, the cubital, the radial, and particularly in the sciatic, &c.: on separating the different trunks of these nerves, we may perceive that they are not

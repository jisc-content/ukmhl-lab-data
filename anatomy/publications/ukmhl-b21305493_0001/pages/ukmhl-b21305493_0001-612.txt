470 VASCULAR SYSTEM struck with this disposition ; they conceived it to depend upon original organization; but I have convinced myself that it proceeds solely from the state of dilatation or contraction of the veins. In the first state, the valves being drawn, and even not dilating in proportion, become smaller in respect to the diameter of the veins, whose cavities they cannot, by descending, completely obliterate. In the second state, as they do not contract in proportion to the vessels, they become loqser, and are liable to obstruct it entirely. Whatever, then, authors have written respect- ing the difference in the size of the valves, it arises solely from the state in which the veins are left at the instant of death. This is so true, that when an animal has died from hemorrhage, they appear wide; on the contrary, they are narrow, if death has been caused by strangulation. I have verified this in two instances. From what has just been stated it is evident that the reflux of the dark blood is so much more easy, and extends so much further, as the vein is more dilated, that, consequently, the effect of the first ought not to extend further than the second; this still less than the third-; and so in succession. It is, in fact, what happens in the case above stated: the reflux ne ver extends as far as the capillary sys- tem, particularly in parts distant from the heart, because, having to cross several valves, and each

EXHALANT SYSTEM. ' 641 exhaled fluids, as the fat, serum, synovia, marrow, &c. differ essentially from those which are se- creted, as the bile, urine, saliva, the mucous fluid, as that of the prostate gland, the semen, pan- creatic humours, &c. This distinction appears to have been strongly felt by a number of authors; the greatest part, however, have adopted the word secretion, to express the separation of ex- haled fluids from the mass of the blood. I cer- tainly admit that there is a considerable analogy between exhalations and secretions. In both in- stances, as I have previously stated, the capillary system exists between the organs that import and those which carry out the fluids ; but this system is certainly quite differently organized in a gland, and in a mucous surface, for instance, wherever there is exhalation, most undoubtedly the capillary system only exists; but the parts intended for secretion are of too much import- ance not to require something more ; besides, on being guided by inspection only, and without pretending to enter into the intimate nature of the organ, it is evident, that wherever secretion is performed, a gland exists, and that this organ is wanting where exhalation only is carried on.

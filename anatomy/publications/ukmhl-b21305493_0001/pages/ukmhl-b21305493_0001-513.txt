OF TIIE RED BLOOD. 371 be laid open, and the red blood made to circulate by means of a curved tube, it will also enter by jerks, corresponding to the contractions of the heart. Excepting locomotion, a vein displays, in regard to the circulation of the red blood, the same phenomena as an artery; but if, on the con- trary, the reverse experiment be made, (that is to say,) if a curved tube be adapted to a vein and an artery, so that the blood of the first may flow into the second, this will instantly be de- prived of pulsation, unless the motion be con- tinued by the collateral vessels, which will not happen if large trunks, as the femoral artery and its corresponding vein, be selected for the experi- ment. It is, then, evident that all these experiments I have so frequently repeated, should have produced quite an opposite result, if, on account of their vital properties, the arteries were actively con- cerned in the circulation. 5th. The force of the heart causes the blood to circulate to a considerable extent through inert tubes adapted to arteries. If an inch of the carotid be removed, and a tube inserted in the two ends to fill up the deficiency, the blood will follow its course as usual, and cause the artery to pulsate under the divided part. I cannot con- ceive what could have deceived those that have obtained different results. bth. If in two dogs, one end of a tube be

CELLULAR SYSTEM. IT even constantly partakes of the nature of the tumour. If it be acute, as in phlegmon, it is a mere swelling that will almost totally disappear at the moment of death, as I have frequently remarked in the dead body, where I have found a part that had been inflamed and enlarged during life, al- most restored to its natural bulk at the moment of death. If the tumour be chronic, we shall find induration more or less striking extending its ravages often far and wide to those parts sur- rounding the diseased organ, as is seen in cases of cancer. This atmosphere of disease is not only deve- loped around the diseased organ, but also in- volves the neighbouring parts. Inflammation of the pleura extends itself to the lungs, that of the convex surface of the liver to the diaphragm. Pericarditis, by its influence on the fleshy fibres of the heart, excites in that organ the irregular mo- tions of an intermittent pulse. Peritonitis, at first exclusively confined to the peritoneum, ulti- mately produces disease of the subjacent intes- tines, when it degenerates into a chronic affection, and this is what constitutes chronic enteritis, &c. It is to be remarked, however, that simple con- tiguity often suffices of itself to communicate disease without the intervention of cellular tissue, a carious tooth, for instance, decays the neigh- bouring one ; the inflamed portion of a serous membrane, in contact with sound parts, will

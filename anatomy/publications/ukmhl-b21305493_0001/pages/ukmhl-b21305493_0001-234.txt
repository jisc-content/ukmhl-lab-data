92 CELLULAR SYSTEM. A consequence resulting from this, is, that parts divided by a wound, are thereby enabled to fulfil the functions of integuments : this is unquestion- ably the first advantage derivable from the inflam- matory state of cicatrisation. But there is another advantage attendant on this stageâ€”that it prepares the parts for the de- velopement of granulations, in fact, granulation always precedes such developement; thus the excess of vitality, that is produced in our organs, appears absolutely necessary to stimulate these parts that are to be re-produced. By these means the cellular tissue, from which granula- tions sprout as their bed, is imbued with more sensibility and more insensible contractility. It assumes a temperature exceeding that of the neighbouring organs; it becomes the centre of a small circulating system, independent of that of the heart. It is in the midst of this exuberance of life that granulations have birth and growth, to whose production the ordinary amount of vital activity would have been insufficient. Hence the pale hue, the flaccidity of those bodies, when the functions to which they owe their existence are weakened or destroyed. Second Stage. The growth of granulations succeeds to inflam- mation, and is attended with the following phe-

OF ANIMAL LIFE. 155 canal of the theca from the medullary sub- stance. The effect of water on the theca, exhibits a phenomenon presented by very few of the animal membranes. Far from softening, and from re- ducing it to a pulpous state, it seems at first to in- crease its consistence. A nerve becomes harder and firmer by steeping it in water, and in the ordinary temperature of cellars will continue in this state for six weeks, and even two months. It is only after this interval, and often some time after, that the tissue of the theca softens by de- grees, separates, and is ultimately reduced, as all other membranes, to a pulpous state, by the pro- cess of maceration. I have not repeated these experiments in a very warm temperature ; in that of spring or winter they have always been attended with success. The thecal canal of the nervous filaments op- poses a very considerable resistance, because, in proportion to the medullary substance it contains, it is infinitely narrower than the membranous canal of the spinal marrow. In like manner, the proportion existing between the thickness in the coats of blood-vessels and the fluids they contain, is very considerably less in the large trunks than in the small ramifications: in the first the quan- tity of the fluid exceeds that of the solid sub- stance ; they are at least equal in the second.

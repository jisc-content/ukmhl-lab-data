152 NERVOUS SYSTEM more firmness, becomes more adherent, and lace-* rates with much more difficulty; 3dly, In the whole extent of the spinal marrow, and even in the projections of the corpora olivaria and pyrami- dalia by which it commences. It thickens and is condensed on a level with the furrow that separates those projections from the protuberance, then in- creasing in density as it proceeds downwards, becomes whiter, firmer, &c. It presents an aspect perfectly different to that it bore in the scull. One might be induced to say that it is quite a different membrane. Its thickness is that of four to one, compared with the arachnoid. In the greatest part of the subjects that I have examined, I have found it very much stretched, compressing in some measure the medullary sub- stance, whose canal it forms ; so that if a small puncture be made, this will instantly issue forth, but I believe that during life it is slacker. How- ever, this state of compression, from the difference of thickness, is much less striking in the upper than in the middle or lower parts. I have re- marked, that the density of the pia-mater in the spine is necessary for the protection of the me- dullary substance, which on one part is very soft, and on the other is less voluminous than the dia- meter of the canal; so that it may even be shaken within : a very different disposition to that of the brain, which exactly fills up every cavity of the cranium.

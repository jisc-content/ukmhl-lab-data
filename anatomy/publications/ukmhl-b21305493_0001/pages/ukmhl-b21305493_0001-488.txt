VASCULAR SYSTEM 34 6 ARTICLE IV. Propel'ties of the Vascular System of the Red Blood. Whatever we may have to advance in re- spect to these properties, as well as what we have stated respecting the organization, refers particu- larly to arteries. In fact, the fleshy walls of the heart, the membranous parieties of the pulmonary veins, are possessed of properties that will be afterwards considered, and which vary from those of the arteries, on account of the difference of texture. With regard to those of the common membrane, they are nearly the same throughout the whole course of the red circulation, organiza- tion differing only in a slight degree. I shall consider the properties of arteries in the arterial texture and in the common membrane only ; , because the cellular tunic, belonging to the system of that denomination, partakes of all its properties. SECTION i. Physical Properties. Elasticity, obscure in the greatest part of the other animal textures which are characterized by

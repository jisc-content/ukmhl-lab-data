OF THE DARK BLOOD. 477 similar result, which has induced me to draw the same consequence. I have been led to try these experiments, in consequence of the opinion of several eminent anatomists, who have thought that the absorbents arise immediately from the veins and arteries. It is possible this may be the case in the ramifications, especially in the capillary system, as I shall state when treating of the ab- sorbent system ; but I do not believe any thing of the kind could ever be demonstrated in the trunks. It appears then, that the exhaling and absorb- ing vessels of the veinous parieties, similar to those of the arteries, are entirely confined to the func- tions of nutrition, consequently that they are not very numerous. This remark is not only appli- cable to veins, but also to the whole vascular sys-. tern of the dark blood. Nerves. 1st. The veins differ essentially from the arte- ries in the paucity of nerves, proceeding from the ganglions that attend them : whilst these nerves provide the greatest part of the latter, with a kind of additional coating, they hardly extend over the former. This observation is easily made, by laying the venee cavae, the jugular, or azygos veins bare. 2dly. With regard to the side of the heart which receives the dark blood, it ap-

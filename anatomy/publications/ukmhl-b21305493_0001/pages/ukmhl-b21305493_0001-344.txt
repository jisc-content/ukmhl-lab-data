On the other hand, fevers, catarrhs, &c., and the whole series of diseases which disturb digestion, circulation, respiration, secretion, exhalation, ab- sorption, nutrition, &c*; and we shall perceive by what an immense difference they are separated. Physicians make use of the words nervous in- fluence in too vague a sense : if in physic, as in physiology, such expressions only as convey a correct and strict sense were admitted, this would not be so frequently made use of. Nerves seem to have some influence, (hitherto little known) on the productions of animal heat. I shall produce some facts that relate to this in- fluence, 1st. The tying of the nerve in aneurism is frequently attended with a sensation, torpor and general coldness of the limb. 2ndly. Sometimes in hemiplegias the temperature of the nerve affected is less than that of the sound one, although the pulse may be the same in both. 3dly. A remark- able irregularity of heat in different parts of the body is a characteristic in those fevers, the special seÂ«S of which is in the brain. 4thly. Ani- mals in which the nervous system is most power- fully displayed, as quadrupeds and birds, are those especially in which the natural heat is the greatest. 5thly. I have known a person, in whom (after the cubital nerve had been di- vided by a piece of glass above the piriformis)

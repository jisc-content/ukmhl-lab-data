1GJ OF ANIMAL LIFE. of the nerves afford analogous distinctions ? I be- lieve that in the different nerves it varies accord- ino- to their function. In fact, since the interior dispositions of the cords and filaments which con- stitute the nerves vary so essentially, since the thecae are also liable to differences, why should the medullary substance be in every instance the same ? Undoubtedly, the colour and consistence of that which forms the olfactory nerves, are very different from what is forced out by pressure from the anterior part of the optic nerve. In the auditory nerve it differs from that of the trigemini, &e. We have seen that each organ of sense is endowed with a peculiar sensibility that places it exclusively in relation with peculiar bodies in nature ; that of the eye with light, that of the ear with sounds, &c. I certainly admit that these distinctions of sensibility proceed from the differences of the organs. But I am con- vinced that the organisation of the nerves has a considerable influence, and that the optic would be but indifferently calculated to transmit savours, the auditory to propagate the impressions of light, &c. However slightly they are examined, we perceive an essential difference of structure be- tween the nerve of the eye, that of the nostrils, of the ear, and that calculated for taste in the tongue, which, on account of its density, bears some analogy with the motores. In respect to the nerves that preside over the sense of feeling.

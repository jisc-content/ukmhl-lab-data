260 NERVOUS SYSTEM ganglions are also less provided with blood-ves- sels, compared with the brain. They do not follow that proportional increase of the organs which they supply with nerves. Thus, those which supply the genital organs, and which are nearly overlooked during the first years of gene- ral nutrition, are, in proportion, as voluminous as those which supply the liver, the stomach, the intestines, so particularly characterized by their early developement. These nerves are, in this respect, submitted to the same law with the gan- glions, although the greater part of them attend the arteries, which are more or less extensively developed in proportion to the organs which they penetrate. The nervous system in organic life being less forward in its growth than that of animal life, must naturally, in the infant, be subject to fewer affections; and this indeed is ascertained. Con- vulsions, and the nervous affections of the second system, are the special appendages of childhood. On the contrary, the particular order of the nervous affections we have mentioned, and in which it seems the first acts the principal part, is hardly ever met with at that stage of life. All those nervous diseases, which seem to have their special seat in the epigastrium, so abundantly sup- plied with nerves by the ganglions, appear to be strangers to this period of life. Another difference, that in respect to growth

VASCULAR SYSTEM 374 tion of the artery, although void of blood is con- tinued as usual. I must confess that I do not conceive how this fact could have been ascer- tained; but were it really the case, it might be compared to that of the soldier who was said to stop the motion of his heart at will. What can be concluded from an insulated phenomenon, contradictory to all those nature every day lays before us ? In respect to this it is not useless, I believe, to observe, that since sound physiology has advanced, and science has been pursued with a systematic spirit eager for truth, and anxious only to accumulate facts, no more of these extra- ordinary cases, in which nature seemed to have transgressed the bounds she had imposed upon herself, are produced. From all that has been stated, it evidently, I believe, results, that in respect to the pulsation of the arteries, the heart is nearly the only power- ful agent that gives motion to the fluids; that the vessels are, as it were, merely passive ; that they obey the motion imparted to them, and are desti- tute of any derived from themselves, depending at least upon vitality. Thus has nature selected, to form the arterial texture, one of those in the eco- nomy in which life is the most obscure. In pro- portion as the heart is remarkable for its vital properties, so the arteries are remarkable for the want of them. They should be arranged with the cartilaginous, fibrous, and fibro-cartilaginous

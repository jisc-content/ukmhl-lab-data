679 ABSORBANT SYSTEM. kind myself. It is very far, however, from my intention, to deny a fact ascertained by Meckel, if it were supported by repeated experiments, would evidently and indisputably prove that the absor- bents arise from the capillary system, as it proves that the excretory and the exhaling vessels arise from the same system. The phenomena of ab- sorptions, however, can throw no light on the mode of origin of the absorbents. On proceeding from the surfaces or from the organs whence they arise, the absorbents are remarkably small; they baffle injection of any description : they appear to anastomose with each other, to interweave, and to form an intricate plexus, essentially contributing to the structure of certain parts, especially of the serous mem- branes. We are, however, but imperfectly ac- quainted with this mode of distribution, it is only after having overrun some extent, that these vessels become perceptible, and consequently that they admit of being generally studied. section IF. * Course of the Absorbents. Arising from the various parts that have just been described, the absorbents proceed in diffe- rent directions.

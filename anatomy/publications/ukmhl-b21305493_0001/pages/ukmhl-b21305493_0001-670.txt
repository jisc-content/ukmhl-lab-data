528 VASCULAR SYSTEM nations proceeding from the faeces, even of a bitter savour, approaches more the nature of bile than the arterial blood ; that it is consequently better fitted to secrete this fluid. I am ignorant if this blood has been comparatively analysed; but I have certainly not found any distinction in its external properties: in one experiment I thought that I had perceived a few unctuous drops floating with the fluid ; but I was deceived: several sub- sequent experiments have rectified the error. I very much doubt if it can ever be demonstrated that the alkaline particles of the food and of the faeces enter into the vena porta : this is an idle opinion. 2dly. It is said that the volume of the liver is considerable in proportion to the hepatic artery : this is correct; but it is not with the vo- lume of this organ that this artery should be compared, to ascertain if it furnish the elements for secretions, since we have seen it is impossible that the whole of its substance should be intended to separate bile ; the comparison should be esta- blished with the biliary canals and their reservoir: now this artery is perfectly proportionate to these canals; there is between them nearly the same connection as between the renal artery and the â€¢/ ureter; the biliary tubes, on the contrary, are very evidently out of proportion with the vena porta. 3dly. It is said, that the slowness of motion in this vein accommodates the secretion of bile ; but on what positive notion is such an assertion

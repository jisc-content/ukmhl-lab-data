GO OKI, LULA ll SYSTEM. Gave described them under the denomination of adipose vessels ; but it appears that like all other exhaling vessels, they baffle the minutest inspection, and can only be proved by a series of deductions, which, notwithstanding, clearly demonstrate their existence. We may safely apply the remarks that we shall offer in general on the exhalant ves- sels to the system of exhaling vessels that secrete this fluid. I shall pass over the chemical properties of fat, the acid it contains, the peculiar changes of which it is susceptible under different circum- stances ; that, for instance, which it undergoes, when animal substances containing it, as the skin, muscles, &c. have been long submitted to macer- ation in water. This would involve me in a series of details foreign to this work, besides, I could add nothing to what has been stated on this head by modern chemists. I shall conclude this article with an important observation. In those parts which nature has de- prived of this secretion, its existence would have unavoidably interfered with their particular func- tions. The penis would no longer have been pro- portioned to the vagina. The eyelids, overloaded with fat, must have failed in the performance of their offices. The cavities of the different organs lined bv mucous membrane must have been strait- J ened and retrenched by its being accumulated in the sub-mucous tissue. Had it been diffused

Most authors have very inaccurately described the manner in which this great arterial trunk is united to the heart. It is as follows : The inter- nal membrane of the left side of the heart, having lined its ventricle, extends to the aortic opening, is attached to it, and reflected, to form the three semi-lunar valves; and being continued within the artery, forms a lining through its whole extent. It is this internal membrane only that unites the aorta with the heart. The proper or fibrous coat is distinct from the last. Its extremity is divided into three semi-lunar projections, corresponding to each of the sigmoid valves, which they support. These projections do not extend to the fleshy fibres, a space of two or three lines intervening, which is filled up by the internal membrane only. Between these, and consequently between the valves, are perceived three small triangular spaces, which are also filled by the same membrane. In order to distinguish accurately this structure, it is necessary to dissect carefully the origin of the aorta from without, and to strip it entirely of the adipose tissue by which it is enveloped. The artery and ventricle should then be opened, and their connexion examined in a strong light;

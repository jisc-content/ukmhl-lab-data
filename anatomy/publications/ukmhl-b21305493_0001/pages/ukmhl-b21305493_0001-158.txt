CELLULAR SYSTEM. i 6 an obstacle, at others the inedium of their propa- gation. The atmosphere it forms may, and does, often become loaded with the emanations arising from the organ, or, to speak in language more strictly medical and physiological, the vital properties of one organ being once changed, those of the surrounding tissue will frequently be altered by communication, and gradually that of the neighbouring organs. The medium of that influence which organs exert one over the other, must be carefully distinguished from sympathies, wherein one part being diseased, another may be affected without the intermediate organs being disturbed in functions. In this case we find in the propagation of diseases, the same order as exists in the juxta-position of the organs. A considerable number of local affections affords us instances of that state of relation that exists between the investing membrane, and in process of time, the contiguous organs and a diseased or- gan. In phlegmon, we observe, more or less tumefaction around the ifed and inflamed part. Rheumatism that affects the tendinous expansions about the wrist, fingers, &c. excites a painful swelling in these parts: considerable enlargement of the knee is almost always the result of these diseases of the joint, which are confined to the ligaments, &c. Many tumours have a diseased atmosphere around them, more or less extended, which exists always in the cellular membrane, and

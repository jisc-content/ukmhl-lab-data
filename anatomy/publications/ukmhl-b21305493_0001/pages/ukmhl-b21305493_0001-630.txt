488 VASCULAR SYSTEM nued to some extent ; it is frequently very strik- ing in the jugular vein, whenever the animal submitted to an experiment breathes, but with pain; it does not continue; it occurs three or four times, then ceases, and is repeated irre- gularly. We are aware it is also observed in the last movements of life when the lungs begin to be obstructed. The vein is then evidently dilated; and then it contracts ; but if the finger be applied, a sen- sation similar to that of the pulse is never felt, an undulation in the contrary direction is perceived. The reason is very clear. In the first place, there is no locomotion; in the second, the veinous parieties being loose, they could not strike the finger with sufficient force, admitting even the existence of this motion. It is, in fact, less the blood than the artery itself, that by the firmness of its tissue, occasions the sensation of the pulse. If it could straighten when empty, as it does when full, this sensation would be experienced nearly in the same degree, a remark that may be added to what has been stated respecting the pulse in the preceding chapter. The contraction of veins in the motion of the reflux we are now considering, is no more than the contractility of the tissue called into action when the heart has ceased to convey the blood into its cavity ; it then returns upon itself after having been pressed forward. It is nearly the

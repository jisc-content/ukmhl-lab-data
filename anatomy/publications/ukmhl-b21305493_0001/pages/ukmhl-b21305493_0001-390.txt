248 NERVOUS SYSTEM SECTION II. Organization. In the adult, the ganglions are generally of a redish hue, very distinct however from that of the nerves ; sometimes they are rather grey. On dividing them, they exhibit a soft spongy sub- stance, somewhat similar, at the first glance, to that of the pretended lymphatic glands. This texture has no resemblance to the cerebral substance, nor to that which exists in the ducts of the theca, These two last, as I have already mentioned, ought rather to be classed amongst fluids, being a pulp, a real pap; nor have they any of the properties of solids: they do not contract; the kind of hardness they acquire, re- sulting from the contact of alcohol, of acids, and of caloric, is very distinct from contraction. It is analogous to the induration of the white of an egg. On the contrary, the texture of the gan- glions shrink in a very remarkable manner, a phenomenon that characterizes all the solids, ex- cepting the epidermis, the nails, and the hair, which form a distinct class. Submitted to the ac- tion of acids, the ganglion, after being drawn together, shrunk and hardened, softens by de- grees, and ultimately diffuses.

general considerations. Ixxxi nerves of the ganglia depend on the organic life, which is indeed, to my judgment, a remarka- ble difference, and has induced me to form two distinct systems of nerves, which anatomists had till then reduced to one only. This one system depending on animal life, is composed of the cerebral nerves; the other, depending on organic life, is composed of the nerves of the ganglia, or what is commonly called the great sympa- thetic. But it is above all, the vital powers which so strongly characterise both lives; I have shown that one mode of sensibility, and of contrac- tility, belongs to animal life, and another to organic. Consequently, as the vital properties are the cause of functions, it is evident that the distinction of these properties proves that of the two lives to be no assumption, but evinces that nature herself has set their limits, since she has created properties peculiar to each. It is impossible to conceive a correct idea of the vital properties, as long as the distinction I have drawn be disputed. What controversies have been agitated, and how keenly, on the subject of sen- sibility. They would never have occurred, if the attributes of animal and organic life had been duly examined and set apart. We shall doubtless cease to confound, as we have done, in one common point of view, the faculty that the heart possesses of feeling the approach of the blood without g 2

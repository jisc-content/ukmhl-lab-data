NERVOUS SYSTEM 234 habit, that external bodies produce but very little impression on the organs of our senses; several of these, as the eye and the ear, become insen- sible before general dissolution. The nerves have then but little to transmit, and the brain but little to perceive. In respect to motion, the old man performs few, because he feels little ; for to feel and to move are qualities that are generally com- bined in equal proportion. The brain and the nerves then are in this respect nearly inactive. The former is no longer excited by the intellec- tual functions, memory, imagination, judgment, attention, &c.; all is on the decay, and acts only in an obscure manner. Alterations of structure constantly harmonize with those of the functions. In the foetus, the brain was almost in a fluid state; in old age, it is extremely firm. Between these two extremes of age, that organ has passed through innumerable graduations. It is well known, that anatomists always pre- fer the brain of an elderly subject for the purpose of studying this viscus, whose parts are so easily lacerated. I have observed, in this respect, that what is natural at that age, bespeaks in youth a morbid affection. In general, the comparative anatomy of the systems in the differences of ages have not yet been sufficiently examined to en- able us to make applications in dissections. Blood-vessels lessen in the brain in proportion

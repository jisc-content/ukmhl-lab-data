686 ABSORB ANT SYSTEM. this process. Some authors have recommended to fix the tube in the gland by an incision. This will seldom succeed. It is much more advisable to open the vessels at their exit from the glands. The absorbents being generally compressed in the dead body, in consequence of not containing fluid, will never present in that state a diameter proportionate with that which they derive from injections ; whatever may be the varieties, in capa- city it is always increased by the impelled fluid. It is their state of collapse after death, that in at- tempting to open them with the lancet, so fre- quently causes both sides to be divided, and consequently produces more difficulty in inject- ing them. The best proof that can be afforded of the ex- treme variety in the capacity of the absorbents is the unavoidable necessity of selecting peculiar subjects for injecting, and the great difficulty of discovering these organs in some subjects, whilst in others, by tracing them through the cellular tis- sue in the lower and upper extremities, they are easily discovered without the aid of glands. We should not then, from what I have stated, con- sider the capacity of the absorbents in a deter- mined manner ; always varying according to the state of the contained lymph, they do not ad- mit of a medium to which their increase or diminution can be referred. It is the nature of

The two kinds of blood then circulate in both cases in streams, so much the more mi- nute as they are removed from the heart, and larger as they continue to approach it. For both of these circulations, let us imagine two trees united at their trunks, and projecting their branches, the one to the lungs, the other to every part of the body. Each of the two sides of the heart is placed between these trunks, uniting them, as it were, to form the general canal of which we have spoken. Authors have generally considered the arteries and veins as forming each, by their union, a ge- neral cone, whose basis corresponds to the ex- c c 2

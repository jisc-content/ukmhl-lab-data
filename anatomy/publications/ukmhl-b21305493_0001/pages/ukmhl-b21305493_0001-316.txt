NERVOUS SYSTEM 174 the brain are more generally, it is true, placed in the nervous system : from this undoubtedly it fol- lows, that in reptiles, &c. the brain, the heart, and the lungs, may be extirpated without death being immediately produced. It is even on this account I have stated in my “ Researches upon Death,” that in such experiments we should never make use of animals possessed of cold blood, to form deductions in respect to those in which it is red and warm. But in these, and particularly in man, it is indisputable; 1st. That the brain is the centre of animal life, which ceases when the office of that viscus is destroyed, as in apoplectic strokes, asphyxias, &c. prove. 2dly. That or- ganic life is connected with it, although in an indirect manner, that is to say, in presiding over the mechanical functions of respiration, which, having ceased, puts a stop to the chemical ones; then circulation, secretions, &c., so that the con- tinuance of the two lives, and a serious injury of the brain, are incompatible. Those authors who have written upon life, upon the nervous system, &c., have, for the most part, viewed them too generally. The connections of functions are per- fectly distinct in animals that have cold blood, and in those in which it is warm ; what is cor- rect in one case, is completely erroneous in the cither.

absorbant system. 729 that is the immediate cause of the phenomenon. If proofs are required, let us only observe the lac- teal vessels select chyle exclusively from amongst the mass of matters contained in the intestinal tube; let us also observe the lymphatics of the urinary bladder, and that which contains the bile, leave a number of the elements of urine and bile, and only select the watery part of these fluids; again, the absorbents of the skin, those of the mucous membranes, and of the bronchiee, &c. leave to air a number of principles, and only ab- sorb a few. Frequently inactive for a considera- ble time, they are suddenly excited when some sub- stances with which their degree of sensibility is connected comes within their reach. Let us con- sider that the fluids injected or effused in the cel- lular tissue, which are either taken up or left by the absorbents of that tissue, accordingly as they are adapted or not to their sensibility, quickly disappear or stagnate to form deposi- tions in those parts. It cannot then be denied, but that in the natu- ral state the sensibility of the absorbents has a particular type, accommodated only to certain substances, which, on this account, can alone be absorbed. The exercise of organic sensibility, then, always precedes absorption in the same manner as it precedes secretion, nutrition, &c. Thus, in the phenomena of physics, the operation of gravity always precedes the fall of heavy bodies VOL. f. 3 H

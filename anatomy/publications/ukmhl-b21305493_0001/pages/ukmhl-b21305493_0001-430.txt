All vessels that convey the principle of nutrition to the organs are also continuous with the arteries, and their fluids consequently proceed from the arteries. Even in those organs that are supplied with dark blood, as^ the lungs and the liver, there are vessels of damk blood obviously intended for nourishment. It is the red blood that conveys to all the organs of the body that impulse necessary to their functions, an im- pulse so manifest in the brain. The circulation of the red blood is then the most important; it is that from which the great phenomena of the eco- nomy are derived. General Uses of the Circulation of the Dark Blood. The circulation of the dark blood on the con- trary, unconnected with all the functions, seems only intended to repair the losses which the blood has sustained in the preceding.

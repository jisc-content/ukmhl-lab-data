VASCULAR SYSTEM 400 terminates in all the capillary vessels of the head and of the superior parts. The second begins in these last capillaries, and consists, 1st. Of the su- perior cava, and of what is termed the aorta descendens for its trunks ; of the right side of the heart for its impulsive agent; 3dly. Its termina- tion is in the capillaries of the inferior parts. In the early months of conception, the blood is then, as Sabatier has judiciously observed, evi- dently divided into two circulations that cross each other in the figure of an 8 ; in each it pro- ceeds from one assemblage of capillary vessels to another, with this distinction only, that in- stead of circulating between the pulmonary and the general capillary system, as in the adult, it moves between the superior and inferior parts of the last-mentioned system. In this respect it is then correct to say, that, in the foetus, the inferior and superior parts are opposed to each other in the same manner as the lungs are in the adult to the whole body. This complete opposition in respect to circu- lation between the upper and lower parts of the foetus in the early times of conception is proba- bly the source of the difference that will after- wards exist in these parts. Every physician has noticed this difference in diseases. If the linea alba is found in different cases to divide the affections of the right side from those of the left, the diaphragm also seems to mark the limits for

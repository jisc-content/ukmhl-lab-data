OF THE HED BLOOD. 369 The more bodies I examine, the more I am con- vinced that whenever irregularity of the pulse has continued for some length of time, there is almost always an organic affection of the heart; from whence we are induced to believe, that the acute irregularities of the pulse, if I may be al- lowed the expression, do not proceed from an alteration in the texture, but in the vital forces of that organ, and that arteries have scarcely any connection with it. We are aware how very frequent these irregularities are in acute diseases. Since then, every disease of the heart essentially disturbs the pulse, and that, on the contrary, those of the arteries does not affect it, we must naturally conclude, that in this important pheno- menon, the one is essentially an active, and the other almost a passive agent. 3dly. It cannot be doubted, that from the mo- ment a ligature prevents an artery from receiving the influence of the heart, the artery ceases to beat. All the phenomena proceeding from aneu- rism, treated either by compression or ligature, establish this fact: if a contrary effect has in some cases been observed, it only proceeded, as I shall state, from anastomosis; and in such cases, it is also the heart that produces the pulsation both above and below the ligature. It is quite erro- neous, as I have already observed, to assert that an artery may pulsate between two ligatures. In cases ot aneurism, the artery being compressed

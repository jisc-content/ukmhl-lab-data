DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 137 above the root of the right lung, the great vena azygos. The transverse part of the arch of the aorta is now also seen, with the innominate, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries coming off from it; and on lifting up and turning aside the left lung, the continuation of the arch into the descending aorta â‚¬an be observed. Crossing the arch of the aorta be- tween the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian artery is the left 2^'i^eu7nogastric nerve, and internal to it the cardiac branch given off by the left pneumogastric in the lower part of the neck, and sometimes that from the first cervical ganglion. The origin of the recurrent laryngeal branch of the left pneumogastric turning round the arch of the aorta is to be dissected out, as also the cardiac branches given off from the recurrent laryngeal; and immedi- ately internal to this nerve will be found a tough fibrous structure connected with the concavity of the aortic arch, which is the ductus arteriosus. The main trunk of the left pneumogastric nerve is to be followed downwards, and its branches to the front of the root of the left lung {anterior imlmonary 2olexus) are to be traced ; and the lung is then to be thrown forward and kept in that position with a string if necessary, while the course of the pneumo- gastric is dissected further, and the branches going to the back of the root of the lung, together with the filaments joining them from the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic nerve to form the i^osterior jmlmon- ary plexus, are to be brought into view. Pursuing the dissection in a forward direction, the constituents of the root of the lung are to be made plain ; namely,

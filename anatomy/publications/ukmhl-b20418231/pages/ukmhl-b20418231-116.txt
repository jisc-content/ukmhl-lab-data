102 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. artery, and are to be preserved ; but they can be better followed at a later stage. Three branches of the subclavian artery appear prominently, one directed downwards, namely, the internal mammary^ and the other two upwards, namely, the vertebral and the thyroid axis. In dissecting the vertebral artery, care must be taken not to injure the sympathetic nerve, the third cervical ganglion of which lies close beside it, sending branches round it. The three branches of the thyroid axis, namely, the ivferior thyroid, the transverse cervical, and the siqorasccqmlar, have already been seen in their distribution ; their continuity will now be displayed ; and the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery will be traced upwards in the line of contact of the scalenus anticus and the rectus capitis anticus major. To see the sujoerior intercostal artery, the subclavian must be pulled a little forward, as the origin of this branch is on its posterior aspect, where it begins to be crossed by the scalenus anticus : it enters immediately into the chest ; but before doing so, it is usually the source of the dee2y cervical, which passes back below the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. 9. The Eace.â€”It is sometimes deemed desirable to devote one side of the face to the study of the muscles, and the other to the vessels and nerves. There is, however, no real difficulty in making a tolerably complete dissection of all the structures on both sides. To display the frontal region, a mesial incision may be made from the root of the nose to the vertex of the head. It will be convenient then to make

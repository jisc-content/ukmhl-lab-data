DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 141 coronary jylexus, in which the cardiac nerves ramify before they descend on the surface of the ventricles. Also, in the auriculo-ventricular sulcus is the coronary vein, which may be slit up in the part of its course beneath the left auricle, to show the pair of valves by which it is guarded at a point about an inch from its termination, where it receives the name of coronary sinus. One tributary of this vein entering it from above, the oblique vein of Marshall, is specially in- teresting, as being the vestige of a left superior vena cava in early foetal life. The right auricle is to be laid open by cutting and turning down a flap from the anterior wall, care being taken in making the incision not to approach too closely the opening of the lower vena cava, lest there be injured the Eustachian valve on the anterior and inner side of the orifice. Within the right auricle, the most important points to notice are the fossa and annulus ovalis on the septum between the auricles, the auriculo-ventricular opening, the opening of the coronary sinus placed between the auriculo-ventri- cular opening and back part of the vena cava inferior and guarded by the valve of Thehesius, smaller open- ings of veins called foramina Thehesii, and the musculi pectinati of the anterior wall and appendix. The right ventricle may now be conveniently opened by an incision a little to the right of the anterior interventricular sulcus, from which another may be carried along by the inferior border of the auriculo-ventricular sulcus, care being taken not to injure the anterior cusp of the tricuspid or right auriculo ventricular valve. The convexity of the

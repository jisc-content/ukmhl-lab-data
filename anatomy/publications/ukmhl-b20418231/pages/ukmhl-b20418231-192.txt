178 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. is to be observed, as also the relations of the struc- tures at the hilus; namely, the vein in front, the ureter behind, and the artery between. The kidney is then to be removed, the fibrous capsule is to be divided and stripped oflf, and a vertical transverse incision is to be made through the organ to display its internal structure. The division into cortical and medullary substance is to be noted. With a lens there may be noted in a healthy kidney, not only the alternation of granular and striated appearance in the cortex, but also minute vesicles in the granular part, which are the Malpighian bodies. The origin of the ureter in a dilated pelvis subdivided into calyces con- taining each one of the Maljnghian pyramids into which the medullary part is thrown, will be noted ; and the pyramids may be counted ; and if one of them be squeezed, fluid will emerge from its apex ; and with a lens a number of little depressions at the apex may be seen, into which the uriniferous tubules open. 8. The Posterior Abdominal Wall.â€”The dia- phragm has been necessarily injured in the foregoing dissections ; but even if its anterior attachments have been removed, its posterior parts and its central tendon remain intact, and are now to be dissected on the under surface. If the anterior parts of the ribs have been preserved, the attachments of the dia- phragm to the six lower, and the interdigitation of its attachments with those of the transversalis muscle are to be exhibited \ then its two crura arising from the bodies of the vertebrae, the ligamentum arcuatum internum arching over the psoas magnus as it extends from the body to the transverse process of the first

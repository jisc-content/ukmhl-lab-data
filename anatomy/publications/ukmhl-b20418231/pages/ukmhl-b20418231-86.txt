72 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. of the foot should be thoroughly cleaned. Numerous short dorsal bands will be found uniting the tarsal and metatarsal bones. On the under surface fibres will be seen prolonged from the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the three cuneiform and the cuboid, and the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones ; also the ligamentum longum lolantoe^ or long calcaneo-cuboid ligament, will be seen, and, after its removal the short calcaneo-cuhoid. The transverse and longitudinal arches of the foot should now be studied, and the ligaments of the phalangeal and metatarso-phalangeal articulations ; and the bones may finally be disarticulated, to show the extent of the synovial membranes and the dis- position of the various interosseous ligaments.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 183 Beneath the cms clitoridis and bulbus vestibuli will be found the triangular ligament already mentioned ; and in young subjects the glands of Bartholin (cor> responding with Cowper's glands in the male) will be found at the back of the vulva sending their ducts forwards to open at the side of the hymen or of the carunculse myrtiformes which indicate the situation which the hymen had occupied.] The peritoneum is to be stripped from the walls of the pelvis, when the cavity will be found to be limited beneath it on the sides and in front by fascia descending from near the brim, the j^^lvic fascia. This will be seen to be firmly connected below with the sides of the bladder, forming its lateral true ligaments, and to be continued in front into a couple of short bands with a slight fossa between, the ante rior true ligaments. At the back of the pelvic cavity the stripping down of the peritoneum will lay bare the division of the hypogastric plexus to form the two pelvic plexuses for the supply of the pelvic viscera, and the internal iliac vessels with their visceral branches gathered so as to form, with the fascia between them, a sheet directed forwards and having the obliterated hypogastric artery at its upper edge. A dissection must now be made for the more complete display of the fasciae of the pelvis ; and for this purpose, if the walls of the ischio-rectal fossa or the obturator fascia have been damaged on either side in the dissection of the perinseum, the opposite side should be chosen. Much the neatest plan of making this dissection is to arrange it so that not

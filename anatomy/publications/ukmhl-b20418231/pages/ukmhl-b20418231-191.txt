DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 177 named ; viz. besides those already seen, the phrenic, the supra-renal, the superior mesenteric, the renal, and the spermatic or ovarian below the renal, to supply the intestines, kidneys, and testicles or ovaries. The great splanchnic nerves will be seen piercing the crura of the diaphragm to reach the semilunar ganglia, while the smaller splanchnic nerves, piercing the diaphragm, end in the coeliac and renal plexuses. Still continuing the dissection of the sympathetic nerves downwards, we come to the aortic plexus, the exhibition of which has been already recommended at a prior period. The dissector having displayed these plexuses is now in a position to make a continuous dissection of the abdominal aorta from the diaphragm to its bifurcation ; and he may also dissect out the common and external iliac arteries and veins ; and crossing over those great vessels he will see the ureters, and the spermatic or ovarian vessels, descending in front of them. In addition to the aortic branches already seen, he will now observe the branches to the parietes; viz. the phrenic arteries given off immediately on entering the abdomen, the lumbar arteries four on each side, and the middle sacral descending from the bifurcation. By raising the right crus of the dia- phragm a little from the aorta, the commencement of the thoracic duct, called receptaculum chyli^ may be brought into view. On the sides of the vertebrae are the commencing right and left vena azygos in connection with the lumbar veins. The position of the kidneys in relation to the vertebrae and other structures of the abdominal wall N

DISSECTIOrsT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 161 small space, the crural ring, crossed by the thin sep- tum crurale, and forming the upper extremity of the crural canal in the thigh, through which femoral hernia is wont to descend. The origins of the cir- cumflex iliac and epigastric arteries from the external iliac will be made evident, and in a certain number of cases the obturator artery, which more frequently comes from the internal iliac, will be seen to arise in whole or in part from the epigastric, an arrangement which complicates the relations of a femoral hernia when the descending artery passes internal to the crural ring. After examination of these things, Pou- part's ligament may be more fully examined than was possible previously, and Giinbernafs ligament may be seen, consisting of the fibres extending out- wards along the pectineal line from Poupart's liga- ment, and abutting on the inner margin of the crural canal seen in the thigh. 8. The Testicle and its Coverings.â€”The scrotum is to be laid open from the front, and the student should satisfy himself that its coat of involuntary muscle, the dartos, formerly seen to be continuous with Colles's fascia in the perinseum, is continuous also with Scarpa's fascia in the groin. The cremaster muscle is to be followed down over the testicle ; its fibres are connected by fascia, and besides those al- ready seen passing down from Poupart's ligament, there is a smaller set extending up to the pubes, partly continuous by arches with the outer set, and partly taking origin from below ; but this inner part of the cremaster is inconstant and variable. Laying open the cremasteric tunic, the dissector will seelv M

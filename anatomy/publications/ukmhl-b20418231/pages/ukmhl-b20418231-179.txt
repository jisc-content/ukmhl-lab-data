DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 165 â– uppermost portion of the small intestine separated by- mesentery from the abdominal wall. At this point he will see half the breadth of the last inch or so of the duodenum crossed by the commencement of the mesentery; and he will do well to trace without injury to the peritoneum the partially concealed course of the duodenum between the pylorus and its termination at this point. This is the more to be attended to as inaccurate statements are currently taught. First, he will note the terminal part of the duodenum re- ferred to as seen on the left of the mesentery; then turning the mesentery to the left he will see a por- tion on the right side between it and the transverse colon, and then above the colon he will see the first part of the duodenum continued from the pylorus. [Returning then to the transverse colon, let him follow it to its splenic flexure : beneath this let him see the position of the left kidney ; and let him follow the descending colon down to the sigmoid flexure, and the sigmoid flexure into the rectum. Raising the small intestines out of the pelvis, let him sponge away any grumous fluid which may be collected there, and examine the position of the bladder, the depth of the recto-vesical fossa, and in the female, the uterus and the ovaries, with the Fallopian tubes in front of them and the deep part of the round ligaments of the uterus. In examining the position of the viscera, so far as has been now recommended, the student cannot have failed to note much of the disposition of the perito- neum, particularly below the level of the transverse colon j but it is necessary to give it more special

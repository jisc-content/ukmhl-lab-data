THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. 2 point, is sometimes found in dissecting cases, and is used in physiological experiments ; but to the practi- cal anatomist it is of no service save for one purpose, namely, following branches of nerves ; and for this the only requisite is a sharp point, which every scal- pel should have. Dissecting forceps should be sufficiently weak in the spring to be used for a length of time without wearying the fingers, and should taper gradually to the points. At the points it is unnecessary for them to be narrower than one-sixteenth of an inch, as the smallest structure can be grasped and managed with facility with forceps of that breadth of point, pro- vided that the teeth or serrations where the points are in apposition are fine and fit into one another v/ith perfect accuracy. Forceps need not be more than four and a half inches in length. The mode of handling the scalpel and forceps is a matter of importance, on which the success and comfort of the dissector greatly depends. The forceps ought always to be held lightly between the forefinger and thumb, their upper part moving over the forefinger. Never, on any account, should this instrument be grasped in the palm of the hand like a fork, neither should it be used to lay old of firm and bulky structures, which can be better held with the fingers. Small branches of nerves may be seized with it without harm, but neither muscles nor arte- ries should ever be so seized. These structures are seriously damaged by being pinched, and should, therefore, be left untouched, while the connective tissue around them is removed; or they may be

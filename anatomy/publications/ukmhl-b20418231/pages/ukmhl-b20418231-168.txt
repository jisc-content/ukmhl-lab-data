154 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. Further out will be found the linea semilunaris indicating the outer margin of that sheath, and ex- ternal to this the aponeurosis of the ohliquus externus muscle continued, towards the side of the abdomen, into its muscular fibres, which are directed outwards and upwards. As the reflection of the fascia from the surface of those fibres is continued, there will be found emerging from between them, along the side, the lateral cutaneous branches of the lower intercostal nerves ; and these, being at once pursued to their distribution, will be found each to divide into an anterior and jjosterior branch, respectively turning forwards and backwards. Also near the crest of the ilium two trunks will be found turning down over the gluteal region, namely, the lateral branch of the last dorsal nerve, and behind it the iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric. These nerves having been preserved^ the dissection is to be pursued further back, till the posterior border of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen is reached in the hollow outside the position of the erector spinse muscle ; and the attachments of the muscle to the eight lower ribs, and their inter- digitation with origins of the latissimus dorsi and serratus magyius muscles are to be made distinct. An oblique incision is to be made through the external oblique muscle about two inches from the costal attachments in such a manner as to separate them from the rest of the muscle ; and each costal slip of attachment, as well as the insertion into the crest of the ilium, is to be dissected out and reflected. An incision is then to be directed inwards from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, across the fibres.

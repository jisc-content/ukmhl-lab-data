DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 63 view, consisting of a5(it6C^or ^;o//ici5 internally, flexor hrevis digitoriim in the middle, and abductor minimi digriti externally. The flexor hrevis digitorum is to be divided near its calcaneal end, and its branch of nerve from the internal plantar found. By the re- flexion of the flexor brevis, the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum^ dividing into four, will be brought into view ; crossed by it and connected with it is the tendon of the flexor longus jyollicis, and joining it from behind the partly fleshy, partly tendinous musculus accessorius ; while connected with the ten- dons into which it divides are four small fleshy slips, the lumhricales muscles. Crossing the mus- culus accessorius, and passing forwards, are the ex- ternal plantar artery and nerve, the artery disap- pearing beneath the outer tendon of the flexor longus digitorum to be continued into the plantar arch, while the nerve, after giving oflF a branch to the musculus accessorius, one to the abductor minimi digiti, which will be better seen by partially dividing the broad origin of that muscle from the calcaneum, and one to the flexor minimi digiti, sends in its deep branch along with the plantar arch and continues on to furnish digital branches to the outer side of the fifth toe and the adjacent sides of the fourth and fifth. The calcaneal origin of the abductor pollicis may now be divided, and the bifurcation of the posterior tibial artery and nerve into external and internal plantar will be seen, and the internal artery and nerve may be followed on from their origin. The internal plan- tar artery, much smaller than the external, will be traced to the nner side of the great toe ; the internal

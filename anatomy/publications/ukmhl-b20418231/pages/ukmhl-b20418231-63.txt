DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 49 placed. The fascia may be reflected, and then the space is to be cleared by dissecting out the boundaries and afterwards laying bare the large vessels and nerves ; by which means the fat will be thrown into large isolated masses which can easily be removed. The space is bounded above by the biceps on the outside and by the semi-memhranosus with the semi- tendinosus internal to it on the inside ; and is bounded below by the two heads of the gastrocnemitcs muscle, with the small belly of the plantaris muscle appearing from underneath the external head. The structures within the space to be brought into view at present may be shortly mentioned. The external popliteal nerve lies close to the biceps muscle, and gives off some cutaneous branches, particularly the peroneal commicnicating branch descending to the short saphenous nerve at the back of the leg ; and it sends in two articular twigs to the outer part of the knee-joint. The internal popliteal nerve descends in the middle of the space and sends two or three twigs to the back and inner part of the joint, and at the lower part of the space gives off sural branches to the gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus muscles, and the tibial communicating branch for the formation of the short saphenous. The popliteal artery and vein lie close together, the vein superficial and, except at the lower part, external to the artery ; and, inasmuch as the popliteal artery enters the popliteal space from the front by turning round the inner side of the femur, it is deeper than the internal popliteal nerve and to its inner side above, while, being destined to divide into two vessels below, the inner of which is E

In front of the last-mentioned nerve a branch of the internal saphenous nerve is to be found on the inside of the knee, and in connection with it there is sometimes a cutaneous branch from the obturator. On the surface of the patella is the synovial bursa, effusion into which is termed ' housemaid's knee.' The aponeurosis is now to be removed from the front of the thigh, leaving, however, a strip from the crest of the ilium to the outer side of the knee ; and the structures exposed are to be freed from con- nective tissue. The sartorius muscle crossing the thigh in its whole length from above downwards and inwards, is to be dissected out, and its nervous supply coming off from the cutaneous branches of the anterior crural nerve is to be shown. The hollow between the upper border of the sartorius and the groin, sometimes named Scarpa^s triangle, is next to be studied. In it are to be found, close to the outside and under cover of the sartorius, the attachment of the rectus femoris to the anterior in- ferior spine of the ilium, and, internal to this, the conjoined psoas and iliacus muscles, the iliacus to the outside and muscular, the psoas to the inside and tendinous ; and on the groove between them is the trunk of the anterior crural nerve. To the inner side of the nerve are the femoral artery and vein ; and to the inner side of the vessels, and pass- ing down behind them, the pectineus muscle. Internal to the pectineus is the adductor longus, and still more internally the adductor gracilis muscle forms the inner border of the thigh, while in an interval

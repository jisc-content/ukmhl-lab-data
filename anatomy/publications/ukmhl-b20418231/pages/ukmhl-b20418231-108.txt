94 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. is prolonged laterally along the whole length of the peduncle of the flocculus. At each side of the laminated tubercle is a thin layer of cerebral sub- stance, the 2?osterior velum^ bounding the nidus avis or vestige of the original cavity of the cerebellum seen in the foetus and lower kinds of vertebrata. The cere- bellum should now be divided by mesial section ; and another vertical incision should be made backwards and outwards, so as to exhibit the corrugated grey centre called corpus dentatum, found in each lateral half. A similarly shaped centre, the olivary nucleus, is seen on transverse section through the olivary body of the medulla oblongata. 5. Superficial Dissection of the Neck.â€”It is necessary that the surgically important region in which the third part of the subclavian artery lies, behind the sterno-mastoid muscle, should be studied before the removal of the arm ; and it is well that in conjunction with the dissection of the arm an ex- amination should be made of the structures passing into it from the neck ; the posterior triangle should therefore be dissected during the first three days after the subject has been laid on its back, and on the morning of the fourth day the clavicle should be either divided or disarticulated. The shoulders of the subject having been raised by a block, the head should be allowed to hang back over the end of the table, with the face inclined away from the side to be dissected. A mesial incision may be made from the sternum to the chin, and another outwards along the clavicle to the acromion to join the incisions already made from behind, care

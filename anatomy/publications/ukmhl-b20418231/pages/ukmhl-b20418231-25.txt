DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UrFER LIME. 13 small portion of the internal oblique left uncovered ]>y the external; and note the continuity of the lumbar aponeurosis with that on which the internal oblique muscle is seen resting, namely, the posterior apo- neurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle ; but leave all these structures undivided. The division of the rhomboid and latissimus dorsi permits the scapula to be sufficiently drawn away from the thoracic parietes to bring into view the deep surface of the serratus magnus, extending forwards from the deep side of the vertebral margin of the scapula ; and the lower margin of that muscle can be studied as well as the relation of its superior margin to the levator angidi scapulae, a muscle with which in som.e animals it is quite continuous. Close to the upper margin of the serratus magnus, and passing down- wards in front of it to supply it, will be found the external resjnratory nerve of Bell. The nerve passes through the fibres of the middle scalenus muscle a little lower than the nerve to the rhomboids. There is now laid bare an aponeurosis which covers in the deep muscles of the back, and is called the vertebral aponeurosis in the dorsal part of its ex- tent, and more frequently the lumbar in its lower part. Along with this aponeurosis, passing outwards to the upper and lower ribs respectively, are the serratus posticus superior and inferior muscles. These are to be defined and studied, and, together with the vertebral aponeurosis, are then to be divided, when the erector spince muscle will be brought into view. Before beginning the examination of the erector spinee, it is well that the splenius, a fleshy muscle of

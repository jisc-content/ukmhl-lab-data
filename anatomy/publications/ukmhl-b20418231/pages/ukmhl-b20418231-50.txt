38 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. between the radius and ulna. On the back of the hand the processes given off from the tendon of the ring finger to the tendons of the middle and little finger will be observed, as also the thin transverse aponeurotic band connecting the tendons of the middle and fore finger. The tendons of the extensor communis are to be followed on the fingers, so as to show the insertion of their middle fibres into the second phalanx, and of their lateral fibres into the third phalanx ; and on clearing the expansions on the back of the first phalanges, and resuming the dissec- tion of the lumbricales, it will be demonstrated that those muscles terminate in the extensor expansions, while other fibres will also be found coming from the jnterossei to join the expansions. On raising the extensor communis digitorum, and turning it somewhat inwards, without dividing it, the five deep muscles will be brought into view, as well as the distribution of the posterior interosseous nerve and the artery of the same name. Four of the deep muscles emerge from beneath the extensor communis digitorum, namely, in series from below upwards, the extensor indicis passing through the sheath with the common extensor, the extensor secundi internodii j^ollicis passing through a sheath by itself, and the extensores primi internodii et ossis metacarpi pollicis passing through a single compartment of the annular ligament : and higher up than any of these is the supinator hrevis muscle embracing the neck of the radius. Piercing the supinator brevis, the ptosterior interosseous nerve will be found. It supplies branches to the supinator brevis, exteusor

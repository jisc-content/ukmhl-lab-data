DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 131 preparation, will often separate in scaly patches like tinder. The retina is seen to be firmly attached at the oi^tic ])ore, and from this the retinal artery branches out. In the human eye the yellow spot of Sommering {^macula lutea) is seen in the axis of the eye, its yellow colour contrasting with the delicate pink of the rest of the retina ; in the ox eye there is no such spot, and the optic pore is further removed from the axis. In the ox eye a portion of the choroid presents a bright glistening appearance from the presence of a structure named tapetum, and opposite this the hexagonal epi- thelium is destitute of pigment; but in the human eye there is no tapetum. In the anterior half of the divided eyeball is seen the anterior margin of the retina, smooth in the ox, but dentated in the human subject and named or a serrata. In the axis of the eye, through the vitreous humour, is seen the crystalline lens with the aperture of the pupil in front of it, and outside of this the iris and the radiating structures named ciliary 2)rocesses. The crystalline lens and vitreous humour may be al- lowed to drop away from their connections ; or their separation may be assisted with the handle of the scalpel. The ciliary processes and back of the iris may then be washed so as to remove from them the dense pigment adhering to them ; the sclerotic and cornea may be everted, and the connection of the is conclusive proof of this view in the mode of development ; the structure in question and the bacillary layer of the retina being different parts of one epithelium, lining opposed sur- faces of the primary optic vesicle. Their true morphology Is determined by their original continuity, not by their sub- sequent contiguity and adhesion. K 2

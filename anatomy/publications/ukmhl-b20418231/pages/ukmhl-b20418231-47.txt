DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 35 and ulnar side of the forefinger ; while the thumb and radial side of the forefinger are supplied from the radial artery. Both median and ulnar nerves will be seen giving ofi* muscular branches soon after entering the palm ; and care must be taken not to divide these when following the nerves onwards to the digits. The median nerve divides into five digital branches, one for each side of the thumb, a third for the outer side of the forefinger, and a fourth and fifth branch each splitting up to supply respectively the adjacent sides of the fore and middle fingers and those of the middle and ring fingers. The little finger and inner side of the ring finger are similarly supplied by the ulnar nerve. It may be here shortly stated that the muscular branches of the median nerve supply the two outer lumbricales muscles and the short muscles of the thumb, with the exception of the adductor and inner head of the flexor brevis ; while the ulnar nerve supplies branches to the muscles of the little finger, and sends down a deep branch along with the deep branch of the ulnar artery, to supply two inner lumbricales, the interossei, the adductor poUicis, and the inner half of the flexor brevis poUicis. The anterior annular ligament of the wrist should be examined and divided; the large and surgically important bursse lubricating; the tendons beneath it should be observed, and the tendons should be sepa- rated and followed to their insertions. The flexor carpi radialis will be traced into a special fibrous compartment, and on to its insertion into the second metacarpal bone. In raising the common flexors, the d2

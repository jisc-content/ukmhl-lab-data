190 DISSECTION" OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. verse and the anterior lip the more prominent. The form of the uterus is to be examined, and it is to be cut open from the front, the incision bifurcating above, so as to show the cavity of the cervix with its ribbed mucous membrane, the os internum^ the smooth mucous lining of the uterine cavity, and the termina- tion of the Fallopian tubes at the upper angles. The Fallopian tubes and ovaries are to be studied, and the ovarian division of the ligamentum latum is to be held up to the light to look for the little transverse tubes in its folds, which constitute the 2^<^^ovarium, or organ of Rosenmilller. 11. The Ligaments of the Pelvis.â€”Returning to the walls of the pelvis, the student has to examine the concentrically laminated structure of the sym- physis pubis, the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic liga- ments, and the ilio-lumbar and sacro-vertehral liga- ments extending to the ilium and sacrum from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra. The sacro-iliac articulation is then to be examined. Its anterior ligament, situated really below the joint in the erect posture of the body, is little more than periosteum, but the posterior sacro-iliac ligament is of great strength to bear the weight of the trunk, and cannot be fully seen without dividing the anterior ligament and laying open the joint. The clothing of the articular surfaces with cartilage is very variable, but in all cases it consists originally of two distinct layers of articular cartilage. The actions of the pelvic ligaments, however, cannot be studied except in a pelvis which is quite uninjured. The articulations of the lumbar vertebrae one with another should be

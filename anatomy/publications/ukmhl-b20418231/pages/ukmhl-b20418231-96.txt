82 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. notice that the medulla oblongata, the expanded con- tinuation upwards of the spinal cord, is terminated above by a transverse structure, the pons Varolii, that the pons is continued on each side into a grey lami- nated structure, the cerebellum, which forms much the larger bulk of the part which was removed from be- neath the tentorium ; and that above the pons Varolii a pair of divergent pillars, the crura cerebri, pass upward to disappear under cover of the cerebral hemispheres. He will further note, in a general way, the projection of each hemisphere into anterior, middle, and posterior lobes, and the separation of the two first by the fissure of Sylvius ; also the existence of a rhomboid space between the two middle lobes, bounded behind by the crura cerebri, and in front by the optic commissure, from which the op>tic nerves take origin and the optic tracts diverge in a backward direction. The arrangement of the arachnoid membrane or serous envelope of the brain, and of the pia mater or vascular covering, may now be examined. The region between these two membranes constitutes the subarachnoid space, and demands particular attention, not only over the sulci of the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres, but over the rhomboid space, the fissure of Sylvius, and round the isthmus cerebri, or narrow part between the cerebrum and cerebellum; also over the interval between the cerebellum and me- dulla oblongata, called the opening into the fourth ventricle. The arteries to be studied on the surface of the brain are the following. Behind are the vertebral a-rteries on the medulla oblongata, giving off the pas-

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 155 of the aponeurosis, to the sheath of the rectus muscle ; the remainder of the muscle above the incision is to be reflected inwards as far as it can be raised, and the ohliquus internus muscle is to be cleaned. The pos- terior fibres of this muscle are directed upwards and forwards ; and in raising the external oblique from its surface it will be seen that a small angular part behind is left uncovered by it. The internal oblique muscle is to be dealt with in a manner similar to the external oblique ; that is to say, it is to be divided near its attachments to the cartilages of the lower ribs so as to liberate both them and the insertion into the crest of the ilium, and an incision is to be carried inwards from the ilium in front, leaving the lower part of the muscle undis- sected in the meantime ; and the upper part is to be reflected inwards to the sheath of the rectus, so as to lay bare the transversalis muscle. Between the in- ternal oblique and the transversalis the trunks of the lower intercostal nerves will be found ; they are to be preserved as the muscles are being separated. The transversalis abdominis muscle cannot be seen in its entirety at present; but the parallel disposition of its fibres can be seen, also its origin from the crest of the ilium, and the connection of its anterior apo- neurosis with the sheath of the rectus muscle, and of its posterior aponeurosis with the sheath formed by the lumbar fascia for the erector spinse. The sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle may now be opened by means of an incision in its whole length, about an inch from the middle line. The muscle adheres to the anterior wall of its sheath at

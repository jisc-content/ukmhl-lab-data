DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 65 tor poUicis, placed to the outside of the flexor, is a wide muscle crossing the sole obliquely, so as to con- ceal to a considerable extent the interossei; and the transversus pedis lies transversely, arising close to the heads of the metatarsal bones, and must not be destroyed in dissecting out the vessels and nerves superficial to it. The flexor minimi digiti will be easily distinguished from the abductor by being fleshy and arising from the fifth metatarsal bone. The flexor brevis and adductor poUicis are now to be divided, and the exact extent of their origins is to be carefully made out. A complete view of the plantar arch will thus be obtained, showing its inosculation in the first interosseous space with the dorsal artery°^of the foot. Its four digital branches to the three outer interdigital spaces and outer side of the little toe will be seen, and also the three pos- terior perforating branches passing up through the three outer interosseous spaces. In the first inter- osseous space will be found the arteria magna poUicis usually coming ofi" from the termination of the dorsal artery of the foot, but sometimes continuous rather with the plantar arch ; it supplies the adjacent sides of the first and second toes and a branch to the inner side of the great toe. The interossei muscles will be better dissected at a later stage. 6. The Front of the Leg and Borsnm of the Foot. —A block may be placed under the knee, and on re- moving the remaining integument and the subcuta- neous fat, there will be found, above, the distribu- tion of cutaneous branches of the external popliteal nerve, and in the lower part of the leg the trunk of F

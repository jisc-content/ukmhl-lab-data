110 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. as to display the nerves and arteries going to the teeth. The remaining part of the ramus of the jaw is now to be divided, and the temporo-maxillary articulation is to be studied. This cannot be done perfectly; for to study the whole anatomy and movements of this articulation it is necessary to devote the head of a young adult subject specially to the purpose. But the external lateral ligament and the capsule and interarticular cartilage can be seen, and also that the forward movenient of the condyle in opening the mouth is a consequence of the mode of attachment of the external lateral ligament, and that the condyle takes the interarticular cartilage forwards with it. In disarticulating the joint, care is to be taken to keep the knife close to the capsule, so as not to injure the auriculo-temporalnerye. The externalj^terygoidmu^Qle may then be reflected forwards, and its nerve may be found, after which the muscle may be altogether removed. This allows the auriculo-temporal nerve to be traced out from its origin from the inferior maxillary trunk ; also the cliorda-tymfani joining the gustatory nerve at an acute angle from behind, and the middle meningeal artery passing up to the foramen spinosum, and giving off the small meningeal branch which enters by the foramen ovale. The pterygo-maxillary ligament separating the buccinator muscle from the superior constrictor should also be studied. 11. The Sublingual Region.â€”The tip of the tongue should be laid hold of and pulled forwards ; and it may be found convenient to retain it in that

142 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. interventricular septum, the infundibular extension of the ventricle upwards to the pulmonary artery, and the way in which it falls short of the apex having been noted, the other peculiarities of this ventricle will be better studied by comparing it with the left. The left ventricle may be exposed after the same fashion as the right, by means of a longitudinal incision close to the septum and another carried outwards along the base; but the longitudinal incision should terminate before reaching the apex, and should be then continued transversely, so as to expose both the anterior and posterior inusculus pa- pillaris without injury. The cusps of the mitral or bicuspid valve can then be studied, when it will be noted that the cliordce tendinece of adjacent margins of cusps are gathered together to their corresponding musculus papillaris, and that the chordae tendineae arise at different levels on the backs of the cusps. The passage up to the aorta is on the right side and in front of the right cusp. Turning then to the right ventricle, the student will be able to contrast with the mitral valve the three cusps, anterior, posterior, and mesial, of the tricuspid valve, united by a con- necting fringe at the base, and having their chordae tendineae irregularly disposed. Also the much more copious network of traheculce in the walls of the left ventricle will attract his attention. Before opening the left auricle, the inferior vena cava should be divided and the heart turned upwards, so as to show the position of the auricle with its pos- terior wall symmetrically disposed across the middle line, and the pulmonary veins opening into it from

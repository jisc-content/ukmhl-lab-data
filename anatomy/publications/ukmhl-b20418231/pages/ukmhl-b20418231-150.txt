136 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. chests were made use of in the dissecting-room, the student would be badly supplied with material. The reflections of the pleural sac from the parietes to the lungs and over the pericardium are to be observed, and beneath the root of the lung the fold termed ligamentum latum j^ulmonis. The lungs are then to be carefully examined, both in the inflated and the collapsed condition. The divi- sion of the right lung into three lobes, and the left into two, will be noted, as well as the form and position of the lobes; also the other points in which the lungs difier by reason of the unsymmetrical position of the heart and spleen, viz. height, breadth, and form of anterior border. Passing down on each side in front of the root of the lung will be found the phrenic nerve, a branch mainly of the fourth, receiving also a fasciculus from the fifth cervical trunk, and accompanying it the comes nervi p)hrenici, a small branch of the internal mammary artery ; and on following the nerve up- wards, it will be seen quite at the upper part of the chest to cross the trunk of that artery. In the upper part of the anterior mediastinum there is often found a mass of brownish-coloured fat, the remains of the thymus gland ; and on removal of this, the left innominate vein will come into view crossing the branches of the aortic arch and uniting with the right innominate vein to form the vena cava superior. These veins should be dissected out, to- gether with the branches joining them, viz. the in- ferior thyroids, internal ma^nmaries, and suj^erior in- ter costals ; and also, joining the vena cava superior

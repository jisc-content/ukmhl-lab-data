88 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. on the edge of the hemisphere a little in front of the parieto-occipital fissure. Between the calloso- marginal and the parieta-occipital fissure lies the quadrate lobule. Further back upon the inner surface of the occipital lobe the calcarine fissure is seen extending backwards, and the portion of the surface between it and the parieto-occipital fissure is the cuneate lobule. The lower portion of the mesial surface cannot be examined until the lateral and the third ventricles have been studied. But in displaying these cavities the student must leave the lower portion of one hemisphere intact in order to see the remaining convolutions and fissures. Lay bare the whole upper surface of the corpus callosum ; note the transverse direction of its fibres, the longitudinal mark termed raiolie in the middle line, and the elevations on each side called nerves of Lan- cisij the thick posterior border or hourrelet^ and the genu or curve downwards in front. By means of two longitudinal incisions, one on each side of the corpus callosum, open into the two lateral ventricles separately, cutting away as much of the substance of the hemispheres as is necessary to show the whole extent of the floor. The lateral ventricles will then be seen to be separated one from the other by the septum lucidmuy and in the floor of each will be seen from before backwards the cor2}us striatum, with the foramen of Monro internal to it, a delicate band called tcEnia semicircularis, the anterior and outer part of the orotic thalamus, the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and a moiety of the sheet of white brain substance called the fornix.

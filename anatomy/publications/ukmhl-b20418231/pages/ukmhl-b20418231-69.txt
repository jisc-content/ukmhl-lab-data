DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 55 between the adductor longus and pectineus is seen a small portion of the adductor brevis descending from behind the former to be inserted behind the latter. The commencement of the profunda femoris artery will also be seen in the space, with the origins of its external and internal circumflex branches. Below the level of Scarpa's space the femoral artery, with the vein now placed behind it, is to be followed downwards where it is covered by the sartorius muscle, and below the middle of the thigh it will be seen to become covered by a tendinous ex- pansion stretching from the tendons of the adductors longus and magnus behind to the vastus internus in front, which conceals it till it pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus. In the passage thus formed, termed Hunter^s caned, it gives off the anastomotica magna, and is accompanied by the internal saphenous nerve, a branch of the anterior crural. The adductor gracilis muscle may now be ex- amined in its whole extent, its nerve from the obtu- rator being preserved ; and the relations of the lower attachments of the sartorius, gracilis and semi-ten- dinosus muscles below the knee may be made out. Behind the lower end of the sartorius the internal cutaneous and interned saphenous nerves will be found piercing the fascia. Attention may then be directed to the region external to the upper part of the sar- torius. Immediately outside it is the tensor vagince femoris, connected with the strip of fascia lata which has been left; and from its insertion a deep slip of fascia extends upwards beneath the rectus femoris to the hip-

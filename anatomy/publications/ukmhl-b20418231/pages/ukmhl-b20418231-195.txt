DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 181 he will see the strong attachment of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis to the transverse processes ; and, bearing in mind that he has already seen the continuation of the same aponeurosis super- ficial to the erector spinae, he will understand the disposition referred to when the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis is said to be continued into three layers. The quadratus lumborum is next to be dissected, showing its attachments to the last rib, iliac crest and ilio-lumbar ligament, and the fibres ascending and descending from the transverse processes. 9. The Pelvis.â€”The pelvis is to be separated from the upper part of the trunk by sawing through the vertebral column about the level of the second or third lumbar vertebra. All unseemly portions of integument and muscle on the outside of the pre- paration, left by the dissectors of other parts, are to be removed ; and if one or both hip-joints have been left undissected by the dissectors of the lower limbs, their capsules are now to be freed from their sur- roundings, and the psoas and iliacus muscles are to be followed to their insertion. Poupart's ligament may be detached from the ilium, and any points not hitherto exhibited in its disposition are to be examined before clearing away the remains of the abdominal muscles; also the circumflex iliac artery is to be followed up and its anastomosis with the ilio-lumbar artery seen. Likewise the obturator membrane should be cleared on the outside, and the branches of the obturator artery on its surface exhibited. [The Ferinceum in the Female ought at this time

98 DISSECTION OF THE HE4lD AND NECK. body above, tlie innominate artery below, and on each side of the trachea the common carotid. In the upper part of the anterior triangle of the neck is to be exposed the digastric muscle, the posterior belly of which, together with the stylo-hyoid muscle extending from behind the ear to the hyoid bone, separates the district below the chin known as the digastric space from the neck proper. The nerve (from the third division of the fifth) to the anterior belly of the digastric will be found at its outer border near the jaw, and, traced backwards, will be seen to be one of the branches of a small trunk, the other branch of which enters, from the superficial aspect, the mylo-hyoicl^ the flat muscle beneath the anterior belly of the digastric. The superficial and larger part of the suhmaxillctry gland must at the same time be dissected out, with the trunk of the facial artery, which is in close con- nection with it and furnishes it with twigs, and gives off, as it passes across the space, its submental branch ; but the deep part of the gland, passing be- neath the border of the mylo-hyoid muscle, may be left undisturbed at present. Also disappearing be- neath the border of the mylo-hyoid muscle, not far from the hyoid bone, is the trunk of the hypoglossal nerve ; and by following it backwards a little way, there will be reached its branch to the thyro-liyoid muscle, and about half an inch further back the de- scending branch (descendens noni), which is to be com- pletely dissected out to its distribution, and to have its connections with the cervical plexus followed up. The thyro-hyoid muscle can be dissected out by

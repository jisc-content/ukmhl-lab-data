20 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. vein as it dips down to join the axillary, and of the external anterior thoracic nerve which comes for- wards on the upper side of the axillary artery to supply the muscle. On removal of some adipose tissue, the subclavicular space will now be seen, bounded externally by the upper part of the iw.cto- ralis 7)iinor, and in it the costo-coracoid membrane, attached to the clavicle above and continuous below with the sheath of the axillary vessels ; also the superior tJioracic and acromio-thoracic arteries, with the humeral branch of the latter lying along the cephalic vein. The costo-coracoid membrane is to be removed to expose the suhclavius muscle, and the axillary vessels and the nerves of the brachial plexus will be brought into view. The axillary space is now to be dissected from below, the sternal part of the great pectoral muscle remaining intact. To enable the arm to be extended at right angles to the trunk, a board may be slipped beneath the shoulder. With a view to the study of the connections of the axillary fascia, the integument should be removed separately : the fascia of the pec- toralis major should then be reflected from the border and deep surface of that muscle till its continuity with the investment of the pectoralis minor is seen; then the fascia concealing the latissimus dorsi should be divided and traced forwards till the continuity of the axillary fascia with the pectoral fascia, the a,xillary sheath of the vessels and the aponeurosis of the arm is seen. The adipose and other contents of the space are to be separated with the help of the handle of the scalpel as much as possible from the

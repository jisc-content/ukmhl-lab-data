THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. 4 other by the fascia held up : and at the bottom of the furrow there will be seen between the muscle and fascia a stretched film of semitransparent connective tissue, which must be all removed along with the fascia. 2. Place, therefore, the point of the scalpel not where the film passes into the fascia, but on the line where the film and the muscle touch. Then keeping the point close to the muscle, and the cutting edge a little turned towards the fascia, and guiding the stroke with the eye in every part of its course, bring the scalpel with a long slow sweep along the furrow. The film will thus be divided by the curved edge of the blade, and start back into the stretched fascia, and rapid progress will be made in denuding the muscle of every particle of its envelope. 3. Attention has to be paid to the direction of the muscular fibres. The usual instruction is to dissect parallel to these. But this requires the mus- cles to be placed on the stretch, and it is not always convenient to obtain that advantage ; while if the muscles be relaxed, and the dissection be conducted in the line of their fibres, it will often happen that the parallelism of the fibres will be interfered with, and the appearance of the dissection damaged. On this account it is advisable to keep the line of dissec- tion sufficiently oblique to the direction of the mus- cular fibres to admit of the fascia being pulled in that direction, the fibres thus being rendered tense and kept parallel at the spot under dissection. By paying attention to this rule, the muscles of the abdomen can always with ease be made perfectly

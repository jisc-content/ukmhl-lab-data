DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 169 wall, partly by scraping with the handle of the scal- pel, and partly by means of careful dissection, so as to expose not only the arches and the accompanying- branches of the mesenteric vein, but also numerous twigs of sympathetic nerve, and the mesenteric glands with afferent lacteal trunks entering them, and effe- rent vessels proceeding upwards and backwards from them. The small intestines are then to be turned to the right side, and the left branch of the middle colic artery is to be followed till it leads to the left colic branch of the inferior mesenteric artery \ the peritoneum is then to be stripped from that artery und its other branches, namely, the branch to the sigiYwidflexure and the superior hmnorrhoidal branch- ing down to the rectum. At this stage it is well to follow back the nerves which accompany the inferior mesenteric artery, and dissect out the aortic jAexus^ which consists mainly of two lateral cords descending on the aorta and pass- ing onwards below its bifurcation to unite in the upper part of the pelvis to form a band about half an inch or more in breadth, the hypogastric plexus. It is convenient in most instances, on account of the intestines being bulky with gaseous contents, to remove them before proceeding to the dissection of the coeliac axis. This is to be done by tying the in- testine at two places about an inch apart at the commencement of the jejunum, and similarly at two places in the sigmoid flexure, and dividing the intes- tine between each pair of ligatures, then seizing the cut end of the jejunum with the left hand, and hold- ing the edge of the knife against it, and severing by

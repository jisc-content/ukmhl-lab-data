16G DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. study. Gathering the small intestine in his hands, he will satisfy himself of the extent and direction of the line of attachment of the mesentery to the abdo- minal wall, and will observe to what extent the as- cending and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum are clothed. Then turning to the bladder, he will see that at its sides and above it the peritoneum is thrown into folds determined, in some measure, by the position of the obliterated hypogastric artery; the part above the bladder, between the two obliter- ated vessels, forming the anterior false ligament ; the more horizontal portions, where the vessels are in contact with the bladder, forming the lateral false ligaments ; and the vertical parts behind the contact of those vessels being termed the 2^osterior false liga- ments. In the female, on each side of the uterus, the peritoneum forms what is called the broad ligament or ala ves^yertilionis, bifurcating into an anterior part containing the Fallopian tube, and a posterior part acting as mesentery to the ovary and the round liga- ment of the ovary. After noting these points a pad of cloth or tow moistened wath spirit may be pressed into the recto-vesical fossa, that the parts may be dry and firm before the time arrives to dissect them. Attention is next to be given to the ligaments of the liver. The transverse colon is to be returned to its natural position, and the hand is to be thrust back above the liver, when the whole upper surface of that organ will be found to be clothed with peritoneum,, and the peritoneum thrown into two fossae by the falciform or susjoensory ligament, in the free edge of which is a fibrous cord, the obliterated umbilical vein^

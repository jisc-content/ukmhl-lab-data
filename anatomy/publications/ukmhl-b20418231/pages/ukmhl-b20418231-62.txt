48 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. the neck of the femur, the obturator externus tendon will be seen. The tendon of the obturator internus ought to be divided to display the bursa between it and the ischium, as also the remarkable manner-in which it is divided into parts on its deep surface. The dissector may also divide the quadratus femoris and clear the surface of the obturator externus muscle with the handle of the scalpel, noting the in- sertion of the psoas and iliacus muscles into the small trochanter, without injury to other parts. Above and below the quadratus femoris will be found the ascending and transverse branches respectively of the internal circuniflex artery, which pass backwards to anastomose with the sciatic artery and fiYS>t j^er/orating branch of the deep femoral. 2. The Popliteal Space and Back of the Thigh.â€” That the form and boundaries of the popliteal space may be seen before the displacement of the hamstring- muscles, a transverse incision should be made about four inches above the bend of the knee, and another about two inches below the bend, and the inner ends of these should be united by a third incision, and the flap of integument thus defined should be reflected outwards. On the removal of the superficial fat, the fascia lata, strengthened in this part by numerous transverse fibres, will be brought into view, and, towards the lower part, the external or short saphe- nous vein dipping in to join the^popliteal vein. Imme- diately beneath the fascia the small sciatic nerve descends along the middle of the space, and is gene- rally easily found, as it closely accompanies a large tributary of the saphenous vein, which is similarly

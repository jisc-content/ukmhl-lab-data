DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 62 the fibula, and to give off, besides muscular twigs, the nutrient artery of the fibula, the anterior peroneal perforating the interosseous membrane near its lower end, and the communicating branch, the other ex- tremity of which has been seen in connection with the posterior tibial. The region between the inner malleolus and the calcaneal tuberosity is to be dis- sected so as to show the thickened band of the aponeurosis of the limb extending between those two points and termed internal annular ligament ; the synovial sheaths surrounding the tendons of the three deep muscles of the back of the leg are to be laid open, and the relations of the tendons to one another, to the bones, and to the posterior tibial artery and nerve are to be noted. 5. The Sole of the Foot.â€”The foot is to be con- veniently disposed on a block ; an incision is to be made along the middle as far as the toes, and there crossed by a transverse one. The integument being reflected, the plantar cutaneous branch of the^^o^^^e- rior tibial nerve is to be followed out, and the plantar aponeurosis cleared from fat, when an inner and outer set of small nerves and vessels will be found appearing in the furrows between its middle or main portion and the outer and inner parts which spread over the sides of the sole. The skin of the toes is to be laid open, and the sheaths of the flexor tendons are to be exposed, and the digital arteries and nerves are to be dissected out. The plantar aponeurosis is then to be separated from the subjacent structures, and divided at the back part, when the superficial layer of muscles will be brought into

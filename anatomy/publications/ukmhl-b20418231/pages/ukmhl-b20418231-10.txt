vi PREFACE. work devoted to description either in the systemic form of arrangement or that of demonstrations. It is expected of the student that before coming to the dissecting-room he should glance over, each evening, a portion of work in this book, and con- sult his descriptive manual sufficiently to have an intelligent idea of what he is to exhibit on the subject next day. Taking with him this book to the dissecting-room, he will with its aid cultivate his manipulative powers and his observation; and on his return home he will recur to his text-book, and find how far his own observations agree with those of more experienced men. He will find it also an invaluable habit, of more than mere ana- tomical advantage in after life, to devote a short time each day before he quits his dissection to taking written notes and sketches of what he sees before him. The extent to which this will relieve the strain on his memory in remembering details will more than repay the trouble. Naturally, the plan of this book is adverse to the evil but too prevalent habit of seeking to substitute for real knowledge of anatomy a mere appearance of knowledge; yet the author ventures to hope that even as an aid in preparing for examinations it may not be useless, but will afford to the student who has carefully dissected the means of easily reviving before his mind the picture of the parts as he has seen them.

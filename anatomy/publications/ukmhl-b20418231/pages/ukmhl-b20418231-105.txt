DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 91 delicately in front of the corpora quadrigemina; the velum interpositum can then be raised completely, so as to display the third ventricle beneath, and on the under surface of the velum interpositum the choroid plexus of the third ventricle. In the third ventricle attention is to be paid to the connection of the pineal body with the rest of the brain by a folded white lamina called the posterior ivhite commissure, and tO' the pair of pedimcles of the pineal gland lying on the edges where the white upper surfaces of the optic thalami meet their vertical inner surfaces, which as well as the whole floor of the third ventricle are of grey matter. The anterior ivhite commissure is seen in the fore part of the ventricle crossing in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, while the middle or soft commissure unites the optic thalami, but is sometimes absent. The anterior extremity of the aqueduct of Sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum will be recognised below the posterior white commissure. Between the corpora quadrigemina and optic thalamus on each side the little elevations called outer and inner corpora geniculata, in connection with the optic tract, are to be noted; and between the corpora quadrigemina and cerebellum the valve of Vieussens (or anterior velum) with the superior crura of the cerebellum or processus a cerebello ad testes on the sides of it, and the fourth pair of nerves arising from its fore part. At this stage it is advisable, if the base have been previously examined, to divide the isthmus cerebri, separating the cerebrum from the posterior parts of the encephalon by a cut passing through the valve of Yieussens above and the crura cerebri below.

116 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. and isolate it from the important structures lying more or less longitudinally. Crossing the ojytic nerve will be seen the ophthalmiG artery giving off the lachrymal and supra-orhital at the back of the orbit. As it crosses the optic nerve, it gives off a series of minute branches, the central artery of the retina and the ciliary arteries ; further forwards it sends ethmoi- dal branches into the anterior and posterior internal orbital foramina and branches to the muscles ; and in front it ends in palpehral^ nasal, and frontal branches. The external rectus muscle is to be thoroughly ex- posed so as to show its two heads of origin ; and between these are to be found the other nervous trunks entering the orbit, namely, in series from above down- wards, the upper division of the third nerve, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, the loioer division of the third, and the sixth nerve. On the outer side of the optic nerve the lenticular ganglion is to be found with its long root from the nasal nerve, as well as a branch from the sympathetic entering it from behind, and its short root from the inferior division of the third nerve coming up from below, while its branches of distribution, the short ciliary nerves, extend for- wards and pierce the sclerotic. The nasal nerve is to be traced forwards to the anterior internal orbital foramen by which it leaves the orbit. It crosses the optic nerve, and gives off the long root of the ganglion which is to be sought between the heads of the external rectus, and further forwards the long ciliary branches, and the infratrochlear, which is to be followed forward to the lower eyelid and side of the nose. The third nerve is also to be traced ; its upper division to the

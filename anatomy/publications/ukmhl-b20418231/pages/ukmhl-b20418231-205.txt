DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 191 examined, their laminse and the back of the sacral canal being removed now, if they have not been pre- viously taken away for the dissection of the spinal cord. The ligamenta subflava will then be noted, and the capsules of the joints between the articular processes ; also the lower parts of the anterior and posterior common ligaments. But what is most im- portant to dissect in this part of the vertebral column is the arrangement of the intervertebral discs, which reach in this region the maximum of development, permitting a full display of the arrangement of the peripheral layers of fibres and the more pulpy central structure.

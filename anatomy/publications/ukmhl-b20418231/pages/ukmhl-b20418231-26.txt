14 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. the neck, extending upwards and outwards from the middle line to the skull and upper cervical transverse processes, should be divided near its mesial attach- ment, if it has not been already divided by the dis- sectors of the head and neck, as it ought to be. The complexus, the large muscle ascending beneath the splenius from transverse processes to the skull, will thus be laid bare, and between the splenius and complexus, to the outer side of the latter, a small muscle, the trachelo-mastoid^ which is the uppermost prolongation of the erector spinse. The erector spince consists of an outer and an inner column, and these will be easily separated, one from the other, with the aid of the vessels and nerves lying between them, especially the external branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves, with the accompanying branches of the intercostal arteries and tributaries of intercostal veins. The outer column being dissected outwards, and its fasciculi and its tendons, which are at its outer border, carefully ex- hibited, the fibres of its lower part, the ilio-costalis (or sacro-lumhalis) will be seen to be inserted into the angles of the lower ribs ; while new fibres, consti- tuting the musculus accessorius, arise from the lower and are inserted into the angles of the upper ribs ; and the second continuation, the cervicalis ascendens, * arising from, the upper ribs, ascends into the neck. The inner column of the erector spin?e cannot be dissected out until its inner border is freed by a somewhat artificial separation of the spincdis dorsi, or the tendinous and muscular fibres arising from lower dorsal and inserted into upper dorsal spines;

61 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. The tibial and fibular attachments of the soleus muscle may now be divided close to the bone, atten- tion being paid to their extent ; and the deep surface of the soleus muscle is to be carefully cleaned, and the dissection carried into the substance of the muscle so as to exhibit the remarkable arrangement of the short muscular fibres. The tendo Achillis, or common tendon of insertion of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, is to be dissected closely down to the calcaneum, and the bursa between it and the upper part of the calcaneal tuberosity is to be dis played. The bulk of the gastrocnemius and soleus may then be removed. The fascia covering the deep layer of muscles is now fully seen, and is to be removed ; when, on the fibular side will be found the flexor longus pollicis, on the tibial the flexor longus digitorum, and between them and partially covered by an aponeurotic con- nection joining those two muscles, the tibialis posticus. Descending superficial to the flexor longus digitorum are the j^osterior tibial artery with its venoi comites and the posterior tibial nerve. In the upper part of its course the nerve furnishes branches to the three muscles, and at the ankle a cutaneous branch which sends twigs to the heel, and passes on to the sole of the foot. The posterior tibial artery gives ofi* near its origin the peroneal, and it also furnishes various small branches, namely, the nutrient artery of the tibia, a branch communicating with the jjeroneal near the ankle, and muscular branches. The peroneal artery will be seen to pass beneath the flexor longus pollicis, and to be surrounded by its fibres close to

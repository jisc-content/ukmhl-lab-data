DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 119 'pharyngeal^ passing backwards. Also the internal maxillary artery, ending in posterior dental^ infra- orbital, palatal, Vidian, and nasal branches, will be seen. The anterior dental nerve may now be fol- lowed down for a short distance in the anterior wall of the maxillary antrum, and the dissector should seek for the communicating branches extending along bony canals between the anterior and posterior dental nerves. The side of the skull should now be removed down to the level of the petrous bone, the portion of the sphenoid bone external to the foramen ovale may be taken away, and the Vidian canal may be laid open so as to follow the Vidiafi nerve backwards ; it will be found to divideâ€”one branch, the large deep jMrosal, joins the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, while the other, the great superficial petrosal, may be traced by the outside of the carotid artery to the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior surface of the petrous bone. By breaking open the foramen ovale, the in- ferior maxillary can be laid bare from its origin ; its branch to the internal pterygoid will be seen to reach that muscle from behind, and at the upper part of that branch on the deep side of the parent trunk will be found the otic ganglion, connected also with the auriculo-temp oral nerve. In this dissection the Eustachian tube is within view, and can be still more fully displayed in that part of its cartilaginous extent which is close to the base of the skull, by removing the thin lamina of the great wing of the sphenoid bone internal to the foramen ovale. The branches of the otic ganglion can then be seen, one backwards to the tensor tympani, which is a small muscle lying

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 109 the ramus of the jaw the artery gives oflf the middle meningeal branch upwards and the inferior dental in a downward direction, and rests on a strong membrane descending from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the sharp edge of the opening of the inferior dental canal, namely, the structure known as the internal lateral ligament of the temporo-maxillary articulation. Further forwards the artery gives off muscular branches, namely, the deep tem^joralj ptery- goid, and masseteric ; and these are to be exhibited. Also in this space are to be seen various branches of the inferior maxillary or third division of the fifth nerve ; three of these appear above the external pterygoid muscle, namely, the masseteric already identified, and an anterior and posterior deep tem- poral to the'temporal muscle ; piercing the external pterygoid is the buccal nerve already alluded to, des- tined to supply the mucous membrane internal to the buccinator muscle and the skin upon its surface ; and appearing beneath the external pterygoid are two larger trunks, the anterior of which is the gustatory or lingual branch, while the posterior is the inferior dental, and is seen to enter the inferior dental canal, and, before doing so, to give off the mylo-hyoid branch, the termination of which has been already seen. Subjacent to these trunks the internal pterygoid muscle is seen emerging from beneath the external pterygoid and passing downwards and backwards to the angle of the jaw. The course of the inferior dental canal may be laid open with the nippers, so noted, however, that in many cases the artery passes along the deep surface of the mnscle.

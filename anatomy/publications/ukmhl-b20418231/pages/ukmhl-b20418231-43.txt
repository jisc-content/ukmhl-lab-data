DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 31 beneath the biceps shoukl be made out ; and it may be at once traced down to its division on the upper part of the radius into radial nerve, continuing down- wards to become cutaneous, and the posterior inter- osseous which is seen piercing the supinator hrevis muscle to reach the back of the forearm. Alongside of the musculo-spiral nerve and its divisions is the anastomosis of the superior profunda artery with the radial recurrent, and on the inner side of the brachialis anticus is the anterior ulnar recurrent artery ascending to meet the anastomotic artery. At a later stage the dissector will find the posterior recur- rent branch of the ulnar anastomosing behind the internal condyle with the inferior profunda and an-. astomotic arteries, and behind the external condyle the recurrent branch of the posterior interosseous artery anastomosing with a branch of the superior profunda. The remainder of the space in front of the elbow, bounded inferiorly and internally by the pronator radii teres, should be brought fully into view. In it the median nerve passes down internal to the bifurcation of the brachial artery, the ulnar artery inclines inwards and crosses beneath the median nerve, separated from it by the deep head of origin of the pronator teres, and the radial artery inclines outwards towards the radial nerve. 7. Front of the Forearm.â€”On removal of the aponeurosis of the limb from this region there comes into view on the outside the remainder of the su- pinator longus muscle with the radial nerve and artery internal to it, the artery giving off above, under cover of the muscle, the radial recurrent, which

45 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. into the femur, and the synovial bursa usually present between it and the tuberosity of the ischium should be sought for. But the part of the border of the gluteus maximus internal to the ischial tuberosity bounds the ischio-rectal fossa, and the fat which fills that fossa is on no account to be interfered with, as it belongs to the perineeum. The muscle is then to be divided close to its at- tachment to the ilium, sacrum and coccyx ; and as it is reflected there will come into view the branches of artery and nerve which enter it. The arteries are the superficial branch of the gluteal artery and lower down the sciatic artery. The nerve is the inferior gluteal from the sacral plexus. These branches of vessels and nerves must be divided to allow of the complete reflection of the muscle, and then the large bursa over the great trochanter will be brought into vie^v', and the dissector will be able to make out clearly the insertion of the upper part of the gluteus maximus into the fascia lata, and of the lower part into the femur. As the muscle is being reflected the small sciatic nerve, which passes beneath its lower border, is to be carefully preserved. The fascia lata is to be removed from the upper part of the gluteus medius, and the parts exposed by the reflection of the gluteus maximus are to be cleaned, namelyâ€”in order from above downwards, the re- mainder of the gluteus medius, and, emerging from the great sacro-sciatic foramen, the trunks of the gluteal artery and vein, the pyriformis muscle, the sciatic artery and vein, the great sciatic nerve (with its little artery accompanying it), and the small sciatic

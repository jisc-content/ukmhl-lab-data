174 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. it is well first to raise the duodenum, and to dissect out the broad fibrous band by which its termination is attached to the left crus of the diaphragm ; then to lay bare the inferior vena cava at the back of the foramen of Winslow, tie it, if there be blood in it, and divide it above the ligature. The next step is to tie the oesophagus at the entrance of the stomach, and cut above the ligature, then to proceed to sever the peritoneal connections of the liver, and lastly to divide the vena cava immediately above the liver, and to cut the branches of the coeliac axis, when the viscera to be removed will be completely separated from the body. The stomach and duo- denum are to be washed and inflated, so as to show the form of the inflated stomach, the direction of its different muscular fibres and the increased muscu- larity at the pylorus. They may then be slit open, so as to exhibit the depression in which the bile duct and pancreatic duct terminate, the large and nume- rous valvulse conniventes and villi of the duodenum, the disposition of the mucous membrane at the pylorus, the thick spongy and smooth character of the gastric mucous membrane and the rugse into which it is thrown. The spleen is to be examined in section, so as to show its pulp and trabeculse; portions of its capsule are to be torn off, to show its strength and connections ; and a part of the organ may be kneaded in water, so as to remove the pulp from its trabecular skeleton ; and if after the pulp has been thoroughly removed the compressed struc- ture from which it has been pressed be laid for a while in water, it will recover its original form, thus

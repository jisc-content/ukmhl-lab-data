DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 99 raising the sterno-hyoid from its surface without di- viding it, and close to the thyroidal attachment of the sterno-thyroid muscle the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is to be found, and it should be followed to its destination in the crico- thyroid muscle. This muscle, with its fellow and the crico-thyroid membrane which the pair of muscles partially cover, together with a small twig of the superior thyroid artery directed across the membrane, capable of giving trouble in laryngotomy, may be studied at once. The sheath of the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, where those vessels are crossed by the upper border of the anterior belly of the omo- hyoid muscle, should now be opened, the position of the artery, vein and pneumogastric nerve noted, and the artery followed up so as to display the external and ifiternal carotid arteries as far as the stage of the dissection permits. The veins will be followed at the same time, and the communication between the tributaries of the external and internal jugular by means of the faded communicating is to be noted ; after which it may be convenient to divide the exter- nal jugular. Also, behind the sheath of the great vessels the cervical "cord of the sympathetic nerve will Ibe seen ; but it may be advisable to leave its careful dissection to a later period. The first branch of the external carotid artery to be followed is the superior thyroid. Its offset to the sterno-mastoid muscle some- times comes off separately from the main trunk ; another offset, the superior laryngecd^ will be seen piercing the thyro-hybid membrane ; and piercing H 2

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 123 glosso-'pliaryngeal nerve, and the ganglia of the root and trunk of the vagus. The uppermost ganglion of the sympathetic can now also be dissected out. Its connections upwards should be traced along the internal carotid artery into the carotid and cavernous plexus^ also its com- munications with the four upper cervical nerves, and its cardiac branch. Its pharyngeal branches uniting by the side of the midddle constrictor with branches from the pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal to form ^h'Q pharyngeal plexus should also be noted. Tracing the sympathetic cord downwards, its middle and loiter cervical ganglia in the lower part of the neck, and their connection respectively with the fifth and sixth and with the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, are to be shown, as also their cardiac branches. 15. Pharynx, Larynx, Tongue and Nares.â€”The main trunks of the blood-vessels having been re- moved, the trachea and oesophagus are to be divided at the root of the neck, and the pharynx is to be raised from the prevertebral muscles and followed up to the base of the skull. An occipital ligament of the pharynx v/ill be seen running back to the tubercle on the basilar process of the occipital bone, and is to be severed. By means of the chisel and mallet the skull is to be divided so as to separate the part to which the pharynx is attached from the hinder part; and if on one side the petrous part of the temporal bone still remains, the section should be made to pass behind it. The pharynx should now be distended with tow. The glosso-pharyngecd nerve, the pharyngeal brancL

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 185 himself by observing that fibres of the levator ani muscle are always continued up above the white line to be attached along with the pelvic fascia to the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone. The part of the brim of the pelvis left for the attachment of the un- divided pelvic fascia is to be removed with the bone- nippers or saw. The manner in which the recto- vesical fascia splits up to invest the rectum and bladder, together with the prostate gland in the male and the vagina in the female, is to be examined ; also the anterior fibres of the levator ani are to be fully dissected out so as to show their position between the anterior ligament of the bladder and the posterior layer of the subpubic fascia. If the bladder be partially inflated through one of the ureters, and a little tow be introduced into the rectum and vagina, the examination of the investment of these viscera with fascia will be facilitated, and the distribution of the visceral branches of the vessels and nerves better shown. The internal iliac artery will be seen to give off from the origin of the obliterated hypogastric artery the superior vesical branch, and, lower down, the inferior vesical to the lower part of the bladder and the vesiculse seminales and prostate, and, below this, the middle hemorrhoidal to the lower part of the rectum ; and in the female there are, in addition, a uterine and a vaginal branch, the one ascending and the other descending on the side of the viscus from which it is named. Besides these branches, the internal iliac gives ofi* a number of others, namely, the obturator accompanying the nerve of the same

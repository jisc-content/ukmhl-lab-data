30 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. The aponeurosis is to be removed from the back of the arm and the single muscle occupying that region, the triceps extensor-brachialis, is to be dissected. Its long and its outer head of origin are to be raised from the musculo-spiral groove by the separation of their fibres from those continuous with the inner or short head ; and a good dissector can manage this without division of the muscle, so as to lay bare the whole course of the musculo-spiral groove, and show the complete distinctness of the outer and long heads from the deep part of the muscle. If the aponeurosis be now removed from a small portion of the back of the forearm, between the olecranon and external condyle of the humerus, the anconeus muscle will be laid bare, and its continuity with the horizontal lowest fibres of the triceps demonstrated. Its nerve, given ofi* from the musculo-spiral high up in the musculo-spiral groove, should also be traced down to it through the deep fibres of the triceps. The mtcsculo-spirc^l nerve and superior profunda branch of the brachial artery should then be traced forwards through the external intermuscular septum, and followed down between the brachialis anticus internally and the origins of the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior muscles on their outer side. The branches of the musculo-spiral to these two muscles and its twig to the brachialis anticus interosseous of the forearm, while the abnormal high branch is termed ulnar ; or lastly, the interosseous alone may be given off high. Also a vas aberrans may rise above from the otherwise normal trunk and join one of the arteries of the forearm below.

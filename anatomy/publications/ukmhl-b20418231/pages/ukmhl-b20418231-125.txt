DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Ill position by means of a stitch attached to the nasal septum: if, however, this common, though unnecessary expedient be resorted to, the tongue should be replaced in its proper position as soon as the dissection has been made, that the natural relations of parts in the floor of the mouth may be understood. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle and the mylo-hyoid muscle are to be divided near their maxillary attach- ment ; and the lower jaw is to be sawn through near the symphysis. The divided portion of the jaw is to be turned upwards and the parts beneath dissected. In the fore part of the dissection will be seen the deep part of the submaxillary gland, with the duct of the gland (Wharton's duct) passing forwards to the lower part of the frsenum of the tongue. Close to this, adherent to the mucous membrane of the mouth, is the sublingual gland, about the size of an almond, with ducts too minute to be studied without making a special dissection {ditcts of Bivini), some of them joining the submaxillary duct, and others opening independently ; and crossing the submaxillary dact is the gustatory nerve, whose distribution along the side of the tongue is to be followed ; and with the lower border of which, as it lies close to the submax- illary gland, is connected the minute submaxillary ganglion, giving branches to the gland. The branch passing from the nerve to this ganglion can be traced into continuity with the chorda-tympani. Further in the fore part of the dissection, resting on the mylo- hyoid, is the genio-hyoid muscle, and resting on the genio-hyoid is the inferior border of the genio-glossus, the back part of whose lingual attachment is still

182 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. to be dissected. The integuments are to be reflected inwards and removed. At the central point of the perinseum will be found to converge the superficial sphincter ani disposed as in the male, the sjohincter vagince extending round the orifice of the vulva (re- presenting the accelerator urinae muscles of the male), and the transversus j^erincei disposed as in the male. On each side of the rectum the ischio-rectal fossa is to be cleaned out, showing the inferior hcemorrhoidal and superjlcial perinmal branches of the ^mdic artery, also the perinseal branches of the pudic nerve coming to the surface through a considerable depth of fat inside the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior pudendal branch of the small sciatic turning inwards to join them in front of the tuber ischii. Still removing the fat, the dissector will find the fossa to be bounded, as in the male, internally by the levator ani with a layer of a^ial fascia on its surface, externally by the obturator fascia, and in front by a barrier formed by the dipping in of the deep layer of superficial fascia attached at the sides to the arch of the pubes, to join the triangular ligament, which in the female is split into two by the vulva. In the anterior part of the perinseum beneath the superficial fascia just men- tioned will be found the crura of the clitoris arising from the pubic arch and embraced by erector muscles like the corresponding structures in the male. More internally, a highly complicated plexus of veins, hulhus vestibuli, invading the nymphae or labia minora (corresponding with the corpus spongiosum in the male), will be found extending forwards to unite with its fellow in forming the glans clitoridis.

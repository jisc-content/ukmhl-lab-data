68 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. dorsal interosseous muscle ; and its relation to the tendon of the extensor pollicis, which crosses it, is to be noted. Its tarsal and metatarsal branches are to be traced, with the dorsal digital branches derived from the latter. The insertion of the lumbricales muscles into the expansions of the extensor tendons of the four outer toes should now be seen, and the mode of insertion of the middle part of each expan- sion into the second phalanx and of the lateral fibres into the last phalanx should be made out. The 2^eroneus longus and brevis muscles are now to be dissected. Their nerves will be found given off from the muscido-cutaneous ; and the division of the external popliteal nerve into musculo-cutaneous and anterior tibial will be found in close connection with the origin of the peroneus longus. The peroneus brevis will be followed behind the external malleolus to its insertion into the tuberosity of the fifth meta- tarsal bone. The peroneus longus will be seen enter- ing the groove on the cuboid bone ; but the sheath which contains it in its course across the sole to the base of the first metatarsal bone cannot be opened at present without injury to the ligaments of the foot. Lastly, the interossei rauscles are to be dissected ; and to do this thoroughly the transverse metatarsal ligament must be sacrificed. Three i^lantar interossei will be found arising from the plantar surface of the three outer metatarsal bones, and inserted on the inner sides of the corresponding first phalanges ; and four dorsal interossei arising from the adjacent metatarsal bones bounding each of the interosseous

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 187 secting the glans sufficiently from the extremities of the corpora cavernosa to show that it is distinct from them. The remainder of the ischium and descending ramus of the pubes may be removed, and the viscera withdrawn from their natural position, so as to allow the origin of the ^yr if or mis muscle and also the fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal nerve to be dissected out on the sacrum. The dissection of the sympathetic chain is to be continued down from the point where it was left off in the lumbar region, and its ganglia and communications are to be traced down to the ganglion imi^ar in front of the coccyx. Below this in the middle line, a lobulated structure, the size of a lentil, may be found, the so-called coccygeal gland. Turning the viscera still more outwards, a dissection may be made of the coccygeus and levator ani muscle from above, so as to exhibit them as a muscular floor to the pelvis, justifying the term 'pelvic diaphragm sometimes used. 10. The Pelvic Viscera.â€”The viscera are to be removed by dividing the attachments of the corpora cavernosa, the structures attaching the urethra be- neath the symphysis, and the levator ani, coccygeus and coccygeal attachment of the superficial sphincter ani. The relation of the rectum to the prostate and bladder in the male, and to the vagina in the female, is to be examined, and the rectum is then to be dis- sected separate from the other organs. The accumu- lation of circular fibres forming the dee'p sphincter ani is to be shown, and the rectum is to be slit open, so as-

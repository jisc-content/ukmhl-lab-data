124 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. of the vagus^ and the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves, together with the laryngeal and ascending plia- ryngeal arteries, and palatal and tonsillar branches of the facial, should be followed as far as practicable, and the superior^ middle^ and inferior constrictor muscles of the pharynx, with the longitudinal and circular fibres of the oesophagus, should be displayed. In connection with the superior constrictor the part of the pharynx above its superior border is to be noted, and also the pterygo-maxillary ligament sepa- rating this muscle from the buccinator. The middle constrictor will be seen to overlap the ujDper, and to be in turn overlapped by the inferior. The relations of the upper border of the superior constrictor to the levator and tensor palati^ and of the middle constrictor to the stylo-pharyngeus, are to be shown. After the dissection of the outside of the pharynx has been completed, the interior is to be brought into view by an incision extending down the middle, and another carried transversely close to the skull. The posterior nares, the pillars of the fauces, with the tonsils between them, the glottis, the oesophagus, and the Eustachian tubes opening above the soft palate, are to be studied. The muscles of the soft palate are then to be dissected. First, the view of the levator and tensor palati should be completed. The relation of the levator to the membranous floor of the Eusta- chian tube will be seen, and the student can judge for himself if there be any possibility that the ex- tremity of that tube can be open, as is often alleged, when the muscle is swollen by contraction. Also the course of the tendon of the tensor or circumjlexus

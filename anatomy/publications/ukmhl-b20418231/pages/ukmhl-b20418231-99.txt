DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 85 dulla and the flocculus or suhioedunculated lobe of the cerebellum, is the seventh nerve, in two parts, the innermost of which is the loortio dura or facicd^ and the outer the auditory nerve or i^ortio mollis. The medulla oblongata, on being carefully de- nuded of its membranes, is seen to exhibit on each side of the middle line three elevations—the anterior 2)yramidj the olivary body, and the restiform body, the latter entering the cerebellum. In front of the olivary body is the ninth, or hyiooglossal nerve ; and between the olivary and restiform bodies are the three nerves constituting the parts of the eighth, viz. above, a small division, the glosso-pharyngeal, below it the much larger vagus or pneumogastric, and lowest of the three the S2)inal accessory, the whole origin of which can seldom be removed with the brain. In the anterior mesial fissure is to be laid bare the decussation of the pyramids, and beneath the olivary body the arciform fibres will be seen. 4. Dissection of the Brain from above.—This dissection is made best on a preserved specimen, or on a brain in situ \ but if the brain be in the recent condition, and has already been examined from below, care must be taken in turning it over, so as not to allow the hemispheres to fall separate and tear the internal parts. The convolutions and sulci may be first examined, but these can only be studied with advantage on a hardened specimen denuded of its membranes. Behind the first portion of the fissure of Sylvius and beneath its posterior limb will be noticed the temiyoro-siohenoidal lobe, and the three convolutions

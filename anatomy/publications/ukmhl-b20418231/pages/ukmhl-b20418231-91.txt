DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 77 process of the atlas is to be seen the ohliquus capitis inferior muscle, and passing up from the transverse process of the atlas to the skull is the ohliquus cajoitis superior ; extending upwards from the spine of the axis to the occipital bone is the rectus capitis posticus major, while partly under cover of it and partly visible on its inner side is the rectus capitis posticus minor extending to the occipital bone from the pos- terior tubercle of the atlas. The great occipital nerve is seen passing over these muscles; and in the tri- angular space left between the obliqui and recti muscles will he iomidit\iQsuh-occipital nerve emerging above the atlas, and giving off branches to all four muscles, and the vertebral artery passing inwards over it. Should the above dissection be completed in the first two days, the dissector may employ the remain- ing two days before the subject is turned on its face either in dissecting the brain, if the subject be fresh and it be decided to dissect the brain in situ, or in dissecting the orbit according to the directions given at page 114. 2. Exposure and Eemoval of the Brain.â€”The brain may be removed, with the subject placed either On the back or on the face; and, although the posi- tion on the back is that more frequently chosen, there is good authority in favour of the position on the face, and it is questionable that it does not afford as much facility as the other. The process of ex- posure is the same in either case. In a post-mortem examination of a body to be afterwards seen by the friends of the deceased, it is

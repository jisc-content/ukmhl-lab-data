150 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. give off the transverse perincecd branch before passing forwards. In the space exhibited by removal of the deep layer of superficial fascia are seen, in the middle the hulh covered over by the accelerator urince or hulbo-cavernosus muscle, and on each side the cms jjenis clothed with the fibres of the erector j^e'iiis or ischio-caver no sus muscle ; while behind, closely con- nected with the fascia where it dips deeply, is a thin muscular slip, the transversus perincei. These muscles are to be dissected out, and beneath them, when they are separated, will be seen the anterior layer of the subpubic fascia^ otherwise called the triangular liga- ment. On division of the triangular ligament as close to the arch of the pubes as possible, and dissecting it towards the middle line, there will come into view the muscles situated between it and another mem- brane stretched across the arch of the pubes, viz. the deep) layer of the subpubic fascia. They are the deej) transversus perincei, which is a small band directed outwards and forwards from the central point of the perin8eum, and beneath it the transverse fibres of the constrictor urethrce passing partly in front of and partly behind the urethra. Near the base of the triangular ligament will also be seen the artery of the bulb pass- ing inwards from the pudic artery : it is placed not far off from the deep incision in lithotomy and might be injured if arising unusually far back, or more probably by an improper extension of the deep incision too far forwards. Under cover of the mesial attachment of the deep transverse muscles is a pair of small bodies,, Cowper^s glands, the slender ducts of which, in a

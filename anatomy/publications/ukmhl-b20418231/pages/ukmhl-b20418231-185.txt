DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. l7l much greater length and number of the villi in the upper than in the lower part, a circumstance which will be seen to advantage by placing portions of the intestine in water. Peyer^s j^cttches of closed follicles, the so-called agminated glands, will also be seen in the ileum, if the subject is quite recent : or in any case the form of the patches, about a third of an inch in breadth, marked out by depressions which the follicles occupied, will be seen. 6. The C celiac Axis and the Viscera supplied by- it.â€”On turning the stomach upwards, there will be found arising from the front of the aorta below the narrow entrance into the lesser sac of the peritoneum a short artery, the coeliac axis, dividing into the he- patic, splenic, and gastric artery. These are to be dissected out with as little injury as possible to the sympathetic nerves accompanying them ; and to make the dissection with comfort, it will probably be necessary to divide the forepart of the diaphragm and to divide and turn aside the lower ribs. The gastric artery or coronary artery of the stomach may be dissected first ; it is the uppermost of the three, and is known by its passing up behind the smaller sac to reach the oesophageal end of the stomach, and course thence along the small curvature to anastomose with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The splenic artery is next to be followed along the upper border of the pancreas, and forwards on the left side of the smaller sac to reach the spleen ; and in this course it will be seen to give off the great pancreatic and several small pancreatic branches, and nearer its terminal distribution to the spleen, several vasa hrevia

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 79 in its substance, the superior longitudinal sinus^ which should be opened into, so as to exhibit its shape and dimensions ; and on each side of this will be seen, particularly in old subjects, irregular bodies, the Pacchionian corpuscles, which will be understood more distinctly when the dura mater is raised. Also the middle meningeal artery is seen branching on each side. The dura mater is now to be divided on a level with the edge of the skull, except only where it is deeply connected in the middle line in front and behind. The arachnoid space will be thus opened into, and the dura mater should be raised on each side towards the middle line. Then numerous veins from the surface of the brain will be seen crossing the space and turning forwards on the walls of the superior longitudinal sinus before entering that channel, so that the currents of blood emerging from them are opposed to the current in the sinus. On dividing these veins the cerebral hemisphere may be slightly turned outwards, and the falx cerebri, a process of the dura mater, will be seen descending in the longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, being attached in front to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, and behind to a transverse septum of dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli, and having in its free edge between those attachments a minute vein, the inferior longitudinal sinus. The reflected lateral portions of the dura mater and the falx may now be divided vertically with the scissors a little behind the attachment into the crista galli. The brain may be examined in situ, or removed in order that it may be hardened with spirit. If it

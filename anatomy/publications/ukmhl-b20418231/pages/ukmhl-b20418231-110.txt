96 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. disposition of the fascia stretching between them is to be noted. In the lower part of the space will be seen the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle ex- tending backwards and downwards, and bound down by an important layer of deep fascia, which invests it and is attached inferiorly to the clavicle. This belly of muscle subdivides the posterior triangle. The superior division may be cleared out first. In its upper part, connected with the descending cutaneous nerves, will be found the spincd accessory nerve, which is to be followed from its place of exit from the sterno- mastoid to its disappearance beneath the trapezius muscle, and also two or three muscular branches from the cervical plexus. A chain of lymphatic glands (cflandulce concatenatce) is to be displayed along by the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Forming the floor of this upper part of the posterior triangle will be found the upper portions of the splenius cajntis and colli, of the levator anguli sccqoulce, and of the scaleni muscles. The deep fascia binding down the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle is now to be removed, and the dissection of the inferior division of the posterior triangle proceeded with. The externcd jugidar vein is to be followed to its termination in the subclavian vein, which may also be cleaned in the outward direction; the transverse cervical artery with its vein will be next found crossing outwards ; the scalenus anticus muscle is to be cleared, with the phrenic nerve on its surface; and emerging from beneath the outer border of that muscle will be found in series, from above downwards, the two upper trunks

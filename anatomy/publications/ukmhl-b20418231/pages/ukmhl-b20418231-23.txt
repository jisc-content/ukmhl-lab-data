DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 11 the scapula will be found the lower portion of the trajjezius muscle, while in the remainder of the region marked out by the cutaneous incisions is the latissi- mus dorsi. In raising the fascia outwards from the middle line, the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves will be detected as they emerge ; and each, as it is found, may be folloAved through the fascia, or drawn out from it, while the dissection of the muscle is continued. Those from the six upper dorsal nerves appear near the mesial line, being derived from the inner branches of the posterior divisions ; the succeeding cutaneous nerves in both dorsal and lumbar region are further out, being derived from the outer branches. The upper and lower borders of the latissimus dorsi muscle are to be made distinct' from the subjacent parts; and in the fascia over its outer edge will be found the posterior branches of the lateral twigs of the inter- costal nerves. The origins of the muscle from the ilium and lower ribs and from the inferior angle of the scapula are to be dissected out. In the interval between the trapezius and latissimus dorsi are to be noted a portion of the rhomhoideus major and a por- tion of the thoracic wall, varying in extent according to the position of the scapula. The trapezius muscle is to be divided by means of a vertical incision about an inch from the spines of the vertebrae ; and, in association with the dissec- tors of the head and neck, this incision may be con- tinued through the cervical part of the muscle. Close to its deep surface are the superficial cervical artery and the spinal accessory nerve and one or two branches

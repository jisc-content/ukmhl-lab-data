144 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. the orifice of the pulmonary artery in front of the aortic. In the angle between the aorta and two auri- culo-ventricular openings will be found a small nodule of cartilage, with fibres extending from it. Lastly, the aortic orifice and that of the pulmonary artery are to be slit open between two of the adjacent sinuses of Valsalva, so as to show the three pouches of which each semilunar valve consists, each with thin lunulcE at the sides, and a stronger part in the centre coming to a thickened point close to the margin, called corinis Arantii. Also, in two of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva the origins of the coronary arteries will be seen, above the level of the segments of the valve. 4. The Air Tubes and Interior of the Lungs.â€” The lungs are to be removed by dividing the trachea ; and the bronchi are to be dissected out. The greater size of the right bronchus and more descending course of the left are to be noted, and the arrange- ment of their cartilages. The bronchial tubes are then to be followed as far as possible through the substance of the lung, and the mode of branching noted, as well as the gradual change in character of the cartilages, which at first are arranged so as to keep the tubes thoroughly open, then degenerate into mere scattered nodules. The trachea should be dissected from behind ; the fibrous coat should be laid open, and beneath it will be found numerous separate little glands, which send their ducts through the subjacent muscular coat to the mucous membrane. The connections of the inuscular coat with the cartilages are to be

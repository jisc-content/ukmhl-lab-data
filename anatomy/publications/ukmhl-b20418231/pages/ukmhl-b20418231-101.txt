DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 87 fissure, however, indents the margin of the hemi- sphere, and an imaginary line drawn downwards from this, upon the outer surface, would cross the annec- tant convolutions and limit the parietal lobe behind. Within the parietal lobe will be noticed an iq)j)er and lower lobule separated from one another by the iyitra- parietal sulcus which, commencing below behind the fissure of E-olando, runs upwards for some little distance and then bends backwards through the lobe. The inferior parietal lobule is further subdivided into two convolutions, the supra-marginal which surrounds the upturned end of the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and the angular behind it. Immediately behind the fissure of E-olando lies the vertical or ascending parietal convolution. Upon the outer surface of the occvpitallohe three convolutions are usually described, the superior^ middle^ and inferior. Within the longitudinal fissure the disposition of the arachnoid and pia mater is to be noted, and the anastomoses of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries ; the corjous callosum will be seen at the bottom of the fissure. With a large knife with a wet blade one hemisphere is now to be cut horizontally across a little above the level of the corpus callosum. The mesial surface of the hemisphere which is still un- cut should now be examined. Passing from the front backwards along the edge of the hemisphere is the marginal convolution, and close to the corpus callo- sum lies the callosal convolution or gyrus fornicatus. These two convolutions are separated from one another by the ccdloso-mctrginal fissure, which when traced backwards is found to turn upwards and terminate

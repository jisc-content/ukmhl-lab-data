74 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. these are both to be traced upwards on the scalp. Nearer the middle line a small branch from the third cervical nerve is to be found; while further out, along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, the small occipital nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, will be seen ascending. Beneath these structures is the posterior fleshy belly or occipital part of the occipito- frontalis attached to the superior curved line below, and ending above in its aponeurosis, which is likewise to be brought into view, so as to show its close con- nection with the subcutaneous fat, and its free move- ment on the pericranium underneath. By dissecting close to the back of the ear, the little retrahens aurem muscle will be found passing forwards from the mastoid process, and underneath it the posterior auricular branch of the external carotid artery, as also the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve supplying the retrahens aurem and occipital part of the occipito-frontalis muscle. By turning the head well to one side, and making an additional incision, the attollens aurem muscle, descending to the ear, and the attraliens aurem in front of it, may be also dis- sected at present ; or they may be left till another opportunity. If the small occipital nerve be followed down it will be found to emerge from beneath the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and a little lower the trunk of the great auricular nerve will be seen turn- ing over the border of the muscle. Still lower the superficial cervical nerve passes forwards round the posterior edge of the muscle, but this nerve is not to be followed at the present stage of the dissection.

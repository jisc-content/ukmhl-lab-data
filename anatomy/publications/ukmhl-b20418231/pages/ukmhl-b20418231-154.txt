DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 140 by one dividing it transversely close to the diaphragm. The reflections of the serous layer are then to be ex- amined. The positions of parts are to be observed ; namely, the aj)ex of the heart directed forwards, downwards, and to the left; the auriculo-ventricular sulcus lying obliquely, with the right side lower than the left; the anterior and 2?osterior interventricular sulcus making the relative positions of the right and left ventricle, the right ventricle being placed below and in front of the left ; the two auricular ajjj^en- dices, one on each side of the two arterial trunks ; the pulmonary artery springing from the right ven tricle, the aorta appearing on its right side, and the sulcus between them in the middle line ; lastly, the positions of the veins ; the sujoerior and inferior vena cava entering the right auricle from above and below, and, at the upper and back part of the pericardial cavity, the pulmonary veins entering the left auricle from each side. The pericardium may now be dissected away from the arch of the aorta, care being taken of the cardiac nerves, and the arch is to be studied in detail. In like manner the pulmonary artery, and then the systemic and pulmonary veins successively, are to be exhibited and examined. The rigid and left coro- nary arteries are then to be dissected, the right one arising from the right sinus of Valsalva, and sending a branch along the posterior interventricular sulcus, the left arising from the anterior sinus of Valsalva, and giving off at its commencement a branch which descends in the anterior interventricular sulcus. In close connection with these arteries will be found the

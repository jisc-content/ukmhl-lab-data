DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 69 spaces, are inserted, the innermost into the inner side of the first phalanx of the second toe, and the others into the outer sides of the second, third, and fourth toes. 7. The Knee-joint and Articulations of the Foot. â€”The insertions of muscles around the knee, if not thoroughly followed out previously, are to be so now ; ^ and the anastomoses of the articidar branches of the popliteal artery, the anastomotic of the femoral and the recurrent of the anterior tibial, followed as far as possible. The vasti and crureus muscles are to be dissected as separate as possible from the under- lying superior and lateral pouches of the joint, and the ligamentum patellce is to be brought out clearly, the bursa between it and the tibia being laid open and attended to the more particularly, as it is liable to inflammation. The internal and external lateral ligaments are to be dissected out, and the flexion, extension, and rotation in the flexed position, allowed at the knee studied. The semi-membranosus tendon is then to be followed to its three divisions, one taking part in forming the posterior ligament, an- other passing forwards under cover of the internal ^ In the vicinity of the knee-joint a number of bursas are to be found, two of which, namely, that placed under the common tendon of the quadriceps muscle and the one which separates the inner head of the gastrocnemius from the semi-membranosus, usually communicate with the joint. The others are to be found respectively in front of the patella, beneath the patellar ligament, beneath the tendons of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus, beneath the tendon of the biceps, and between a portion of the semi-membranosus tendon and the groove on the tibia.

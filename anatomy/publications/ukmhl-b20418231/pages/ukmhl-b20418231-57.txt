43 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 1. The Gluteal Region.—The subject being placed on its face, with blocks under the pelvis, an incision is to be made from the middle line outwards, along the crest of the ilium ; and another, commencing at the same point, is to be carried down to the lower end of the sacrum, then outwards, so as to reach a point about six inches below the great trochanter.^ The largest cutaneous nerves of this region cross down over the crest of the ilium, and will be found the more easily by attending to the circumstance that while the adipose tissue on the back is continued down in an uninterrupted sheet over the gluteus maximus, a distinct deeper layer of fat fills up the hollow between the crest of the ilium and the upper border of that muscle ; and it is between the two layers that the nerves descend. The nerves descend- ing over the crest of the ilium are :—Two or three branches from j^osterior divisions of lumbar nerves, which cross by the outer margin of the erector spinse muscle, and in front of them the lateral branches of the last dorsal and ilio-hyj^ogastric nerves.

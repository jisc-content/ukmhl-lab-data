Lastly, the hejxitic artery will be observed passing forwards below the neck of the smaller sac and in front of the foramen of Winslow, and there- fore lying between the folds of the small omentum. It divides into the right and left hepatic artery before entering the liver, and it is from the right hepatic that the small cystic artery is given off to the gall- bladder. But before its bifurcation the hepatic artery will be seen to give off other branches, namely, the pyloric branch which runs from right to left to meet the coronary artery on the small curvature of the stomach, and the much larger gastro-duodenal branch which again divides into right gastro-ejnj^loic OjHasto- mosing with the left gastro-epiploic on the great cur- vature of the stomach, and the superior p)ancreatico- duodenal which meets the inferior pancreatico-duo- denal branch of the superior mesenteric on the con- cavity of the duodenum. This last-named branch may be followed to its source, and the superior mesen- teric may be dissected up to its origin beneath the pancreas.^ The three branches of the coeliac axis are each accompanied by a plexus of sympathetic nerves, which takes its name from the artery. These should be recognised and followed back to the coeliac plexus; Returning the stomach to its natural position, the dissector should now remove the whole of the remain- ^ To prevent confusion it is necessary to warn the student that one or both of the branches to the liver may come from the superior mesenteric artery.

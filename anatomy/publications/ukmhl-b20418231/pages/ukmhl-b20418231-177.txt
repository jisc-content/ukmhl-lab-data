DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 163 lower end of the testicle may be exhibited, and the epididymis may be partially unravelled. The lob us major may be now raised from the tunica albuginea, and beneath it, if the dissection be made carefully, a series of little cones may be displayed with their apices next to the testes, their bases connected with the epididymis : these are the coni vasculosis from ten to fifteen in number, and, if difficulty be found in exhibiting them, they may be stretched on glass, and dissected with transmitted light. The tunica albu- ginea, the fibrous investment of the testis proper, is now to be divided down the front, and from its deep surface thin septa^ which must be severed, will Ibe seen to pass between the masses of the secreting substance. Also it will be found to be lined with a thin coating of loose tissue, which in finely injected specimens is seen to consist principally of small blood- vessels, forming the tunica vasculosa. In fluid, the secreting substance is readily separated into a multi- tude of lobules, and these are easily shown by slight teasing to consist of delicate convoluted tubules, very slightly adherent to one another. On dividing the testicle transversely, a section of the mediastinum testis, or corpus Highmorianum, will be seen, a pro- jection forwards from the back of the tunica albu- ginea; but the entrance of the seminal tubules by vasa recta into this mediastinum, the rete testis in its substance, and the emergence of the vasa efferentia to form the coni vasculosi, are matters too delicate to be seen without resort to special modes of prepara- tion. 4.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 149 In the anterior half of the perinseum, a superficial fascia or layer of the rete adiposum will be found continuous with that over the thighs and with the contents of the ischio-rectal fossa, and beneath it a layer of membranous fascia bound down to the arch of the pubes at the sides, and dipping down to be connected with the margin of the triangular ligament behind. This is what is sometimes called CGiles's fascia^ and is important in the history of urinary infiltrations, as it prevents urine extravasated by injury of the spongy portion of the urethra from passing backwards into the hinder part of the peri- nseum and down into the thighs. Before it has been much laid bare a blow-pipe should be introduced under it, and it should be inflated so as to exhibit that the district beneath it is cut off alike from the back part of the perinseum and from the thigh, and also that on one side it is separated from the other behind the scrotum by a mesial septum, which being imperfect in front, allows the air, after it has reached the scrotum, to pass from one side to the other. As it extends forwards into the scrotum, this fascia will be noticed to become thicker, being continuous with the involunts^ry muscular tunic called the dartos. Entering beneath this fascia from behind will be found the two anterior 2)erinc8al branches of the pudic nerve, and external to them, crossing in front of the ischial tuberosity, the inferior imdendal branch of the small sciatic nerve ; also entering from behind is the 'perineal branch of the pudic artery. These three scrotal nerves are to be followed out after division of the fascia ; and the perinseal artery will be seen to

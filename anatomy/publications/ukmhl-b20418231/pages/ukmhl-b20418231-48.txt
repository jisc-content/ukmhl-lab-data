36 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. origins of the lumhricales muscles from the flexor profundus will be brought into view, and their nerves must at this stage be traced into them; but the in- sertions of the lumbricales cannot be fully seen till the extensor digitorum is dissected. The sheaths on the fingers are to be cut open, and the disposition of the tendons, with the slender vincida accessoria attached to their deep surface, is to be seen, as well as the extent of their thecse up into the palm. The short muscles of the thumb and little finger must next be examined. The abductor j^ollicis is re- cognised by its parallel fibres and free edges as it passes down to the outer side of the first phalanx. The oj^ponens jjollicis is distinguished from the flexor brevis, which covers it, by its fibres being inserted into the metacarpal bone along its length; while, on the inner side of the thumb, the adductor poUicis is sufliciently distinct as it comes from the third metacarpal bone. The remaining mass of muscle arising by two heads and likewise inserted into the first phalanx of the thumb by two insertions, an outer and inner, constitutes the flexor hrevis. The abductor and flexor minimi digiti are separated by the deep branches of the ulnar nerve and artery, and the ojyponens mifmni digiti is distinguished by being in- serted into the length of the metacarpal bone. These muscles having been seen, the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve are to be followed, and the artery will be a guide to the deep jmhnar arch (from the radial), which it completes. The recurrent, supe- rior perforating and palmar interosseous branches of the deep palmar arch are to be dissected, as also the

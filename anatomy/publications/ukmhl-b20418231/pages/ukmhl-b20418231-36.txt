24 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. and the directions of their fibres, can then be studied, and the separation of the limb from the body may be completed by dividing the serratus magnus, levator anguli scapulae, and omo-hyoid muscles. 4. The Scapular Region and Shoulder. â€” The scapular attachments of all the muscles which have been divided in separating the limb from the body should be carefully dissected out and trimmed, if this have not been fully done at an earlier stage. So also the dissection of the axillary vessels and axillary part of the brachial plexus should be completed ; the sJiort subscapular nerve, ending in the subscapidaris muscle, will probably be brought into view for the first time ; and the subscapularis muscle should be cleaned. The insertion of the pectoralis major should be carefully dissected, so as to display the manner in which the lower fibres of the muscle turn in under the upper part, and in which the tendon is folded so as to form a hem to the anterior border of the axilla. The latissimus dorsi should likewise be traced up to its insertion ; the bursa between its tendon and that of the teres major should be exhibited, and the teres major should be cleaned, and the relation between those two muscles studied. A block should now be placed under the axillary border of the scapula, and the integuments should be dissected from the great muscle of the shoulder, the deltoid muscle, care being- taken of the cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve curving round its hinder border. The manner in which the aponeurosis covering the infra-spinatus muscle splits at the posterior border of the deltoid,

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 107 completing a circle round the mouth. Lastly, the cartilages of the nose should be dissected, so as to display the form of the alar cartilages and their dis- tinctness from the triangular and septal cartilages. 10. Temporal and Zygomatic Region.â€”Let the branches of the facial nerve be traced back through the parotid gland, and the main trunk followed up to the stylo-mastoid foramen. The two little branches given off at that point and supplying the stylo-hyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the digastric should also be found. The parotid gland is then to be re- moved : its intimate connection with the terminal part of the external carotid, and the origins of the internal maxillary and temporal arteries, will in doing this be noted, as well as its relations to muscles and to the part of the cervical fascia known as the stylo-max- i/^ar^/ligament which extends between the lower part of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw, with its lower edge the more superficial, and in cases of enlargement of the glands forms a septum between the parotid and submaxillary glands. The temporal fascia is now to be laid bare, and an incision is to be made along the upper border of the zygoma, so as to show that the temporal fascia is divided here into two layers with fat between them,, among which lies the teriiporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve, the terminal branches of which have been already noted. The fascia is then to be com- pletely divided so as to lay bare the temporal muscle. The masseter muscle is to be properly cleaned, and its artery and nerve may be found as they emerge from the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw and enter its upper

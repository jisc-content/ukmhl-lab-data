92 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the section the locus niger will be seen. The right and left portions of the cerebrum should be separated by an incision in the middle line ; the parts dis- played in section should be studied, and one of the anterior crura of the fornix should be followed down to the corresponding corpus albicans, and its fibres traced as they twist within that structure and turn upwards into the optic thalamus. The remaining convolutions and fissures of the inner surface of the hemisphere can now be displayed. The gyrus fornicatus will be seen turning round the posterior end of the corpus callosum to become merged with the uncifiate coyivolution, and the continuation of the parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures beyond their junction will be noticed passing down to the j)oint where the two convolutions meet. Above the uncinate convolution lies the dentatefissure^ and beneath it the collateral fissure. In removing the pia mater from the dentate fissure the student should note its continuity with the choroid plexus of the descending cornu, and on looking into the fissure he should see the white toiuia hipi^ocamin^ and beneath it the fascia dentata^ the edge of the super- ficial grey matter of the hemisphere. The tcEuia and fascia dentata may both be followed forwards to the hook-like end of the uncinate convolution. Beneath the collateral fissure is the inferior temiwro-occipital convolution. By transverse section it may be shown that the dentate fissure corresponds to the projection of the hippocampus major, the collateral fissure to the eminentia collateralis, and the calcarine fissure to the hippocampus minor.

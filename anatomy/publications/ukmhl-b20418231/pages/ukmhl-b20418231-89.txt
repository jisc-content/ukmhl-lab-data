DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 75 Passing backwards across the space between the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius are the spinal accessory nerve, and lower down some branches of the cervical plexus destined for the supply of the latter muscle. The cervical part of the trapezius should be divided by means of a vertical incision made in co-operation with the dissector of the upper limb ; and along with him the spinal accessory nerve and superficial cervical artery descending on the deep surface of the trapezius should be dissected out. Along with the spinal accessory the branches from the cervical plexus already mentioned are to be followed. The different nerves are often freely con- nected with one another beneath the muscle. The^ splenius muscle, which can be distinguished from the- portions of the erector spinse along its lower border by its fibres passing from spines to transverse pro- cesses, is next to be cleaned, and afterwards divided vertically about an inch from the middle line, and its attachments dissected up to their bony connec- tions, so as to distinguish the sp)lenius capitis and splenius colli, and bring into view the stout muscle on which it lies, namely, the complexus, as also the thin strip of fibres, the trachelo-mastoid muscle as- cending between the splenius and the outer part of the complexus muscle. Also the occipital artery close to the skull is to be cleared in the part of its course beneath the trachelo-mastoid and splenius muscles, and its cervical branch is to be followed downwards.

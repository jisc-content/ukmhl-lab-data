9 THE ORDER OF DISSECTION. the neck have had an opportunity, in conjunction with the dissectors of the arms, to trace the continuity of the structures which pass from one region into the other. This will usually be accomplished within four days; and on the fifth day after turning the subject the dissectors of the thorax may commence. Although it is necessary to fix a stated time as a standard to regulate the turning of the body and the removal of the upper limbs, it will be found prac- tically that, when mutual good feeling and a common spirit of industry exist, students may beneficially accommodate one another as regards the periods for these proceedings. And in a school where such good feeling exists, it may be further mentioned, no student need ever be idle at the times when it unavoidably happens that he is unsupplied w4th a part, as, with a little tact, he can always be learning from the dis- sections of others, without incommoding the dissec- tors who are at work. It is essential to comfort that, when a part is allotted to two dissectors, their hours of attendance and period of study shall sufficiently correspond. It is therefore desirable that as far as possible students should arrange among themselves with regard to partners.

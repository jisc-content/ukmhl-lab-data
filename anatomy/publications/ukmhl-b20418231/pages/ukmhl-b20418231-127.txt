DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 113 which were cut across in removing the brain ; and the blood from these two sources flows to the torcular along the straight sinus in the angle of union of the falx cerebri with the tentorium. In the falx cerebelli will be found the occipital sinus, also leading into the torcular Herophili. The lateral sinuses are to be laid open in their whole course down to the jugular fora- men ; and there the commencement of the jugular vein is to be seen with the three parts of the eighth nerve internal to it, and the inferior petrosal sinus running along the occipital border of the petrous bone and separating the glosso-pharyngeal nerve from the jmeumogastric and sp>inal accessory as it falls into the jugular vein. Along the free border of the petrous bone the sup>erior i^etrosal sinus is to be laid open ; and, between the two inferior petrosal sinuses, across the basilar process of the occipital bone, is the trans- verse sinus. An incision is now to be carried from a position immediately outside the point of exit of the third nerve, backwards and then outwards, to that of the fifth, and is to be prolonged a little way forward and outward, and on raising the flap of dura mater so made, the cavernous sinus will be brought into view ; and by incisions round the opening where the infundibulum descended to the pituitary body, the circular sinus uniting the two cavernous sinuses will be laid open. The positions in the walls of the caver- nous sinus of the third, fourth, ophthalmic division of the fifth, and sixth nerves and the internal carotid artery are to be observed ; and the dura mater should be dissected from the other two divisions of the fifth nerve, and the trunk of the nerve should be raised so I

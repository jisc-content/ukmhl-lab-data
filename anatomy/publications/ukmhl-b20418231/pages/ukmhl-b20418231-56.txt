42 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. be made sufficient to allow the movements of sur- faces to be seen. Thus, the lower radio-ulnar articu- lation may be opened in front, so as to exhibit the upper surface of the triangular cctrtilage ; and open- ings in front and behind may be made to display the movements of the radius on the first row of carpal bones, the movements of one row on the other, and of the bones of each row one on another ; and until these examinations have been made and the mov- ability of the metacarpal bones at their carpal ends has been studied, the lateral ligaments and as many other strong bands as possible should be left intact. The articulation of the thumb with the trapezium should next be examined, and the articulations of the metacarpal bones with the phalanges,^ and of the phalanges one with another ; and afterwards the carpal joints should be thoroughly laid open to show the interosseous ligaments between them and between the carpal ends of the metacarpal bones, and to bring into view the extent of the synovial cavities. ^ The metacarpo-phalangeal articulations of the four inner digits deserve particular attention, as they exhibit a. well- marked important and unique arrangement which anatomists have overlooked. When the student has dissected out the anterior ligament, he will find that its fibres are arched, and act as a sling for the head of the metacarpal bone, preventing over-extension; and on bending the joints he will find that the lateral ligaments are put on the stretch by their meta- carpal attachments being situated far back, and that thus it happens that the fingers have only one position in flexion, while in extension, the looseness of the lateral ligaments per- mits separation and approximation.

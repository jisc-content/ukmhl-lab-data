DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 103 another incision outwards from the middle line to the inner canthus of the eye, and carry it round by the margins of the eyelids. This will allow the very superficial orbicularis j^cclpehrarum muscle to be dis- sected out ; and the te7ido oculi at its inner part is to be studied, especially its relation to the nasal duct, which will be understood on comparing the dissection with a skull. The integument of the forehead, as far back as the ear, may then be reflected. Near the middle line will be found the suj^Tatrochlear branch of the oflitlialmic nerve, and frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery ; and further outwards, ascending from the supraorbital notch, the suiwaorhital branch of the same nerve and the corresponding branch of the ophthalmic artery. Beneath the supratrochlear and close to the inner angle of the eye is the infratrochlear nerve and the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. Extending upwards from under cover of the orbicu- laris palpebrarum is the frontalis muscle, or frontal belly of the occijnto-frontalis lost in aponeurosis ex- tending over the cranium ; and its innermost fibres are prolonged downwards on the nose to form the pyramidalis nasi, which differs from the frontalis in having its fixed attachment below. On reflecting the frontalis the corrugator supercilii will come into view attached to the inner end of the superciliary ridge, and extending upwards and outwards in an expanded form for a considerable distance in close connection with the deep surface of the frontalis. Farther out, on the temporal region, will be found the ramifica- tions of the temporal artery with the branches of the auriculo-temporal division of the inferior maxillary

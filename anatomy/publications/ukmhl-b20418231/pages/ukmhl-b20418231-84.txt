70 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. lateral ligament, and the third expanding into the aponeurosis of the popliteus muscle. This aponeurosis is to be removed, and the 2^opliteiis muscle is to be followed up to its insertion into the femur under cover of the external lateral ligament. The joint may then be opened from above, in front of the lateral ligaments ; and in the interior will be found a pad of fat, or so-called Haversian glands, below the patella, with the ligamentiim miicosum passing from the middle of it to the fossa between the condyles of the femur, and two lateral folds called alar ligaments extending laterally from it. The extent of the sy- novial membrane should be studied; the external or anterior crucial, and the posterior or internal cr ucicd ligament should be shown, and their degree of ten- sion in different positions of the joint noted, and the loose parts of the walls of the joint should be removed so as to let the semilunar cartilages be more fully seen, and to allow of a detailed inspection of the relations of those cartilages and of the articular surfaces of the bones in different positions of the joint. The upper and lower tibio-fibular articulations are next to be studied, as well as the interosseous membrane ; and for this purpose the muscles are to be completely removed from the leg. The upper tibio-fibular joint presents an anterior and j^osterior ligament and a synovial membrane for study. The lower joint presents an anterior and posterior liga- ment and a long band, the transverse ligament, which deepens the concavity for the ankle-joint below the posterior ligament, and also an interosseous ligament which, however, cannot be seen till, at the end of the

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 67 terthcs, and rising deeply between the two longer muscles is the extensor poUicis. Lying deeply on the interosseous membrane are the anterior tibial vessels and nerve : the artery will be seen piercing the membrane from behind, and immediately giving off a recurrent branch to the knee, while near the ankle it gives off an external and internal malleolar branch. The nerve may be traced back through the fibres of the extensor longus digitorum, and down- wards beneath the anterior annular ligament to the foot. It distributes branches to the four muscles upon the front of the leg and divides upon the dorsum of the foot into two branches, an external, enlarged at its termination like the posterior interosseous nerve of the arm, and supplying branches to the extensor brevis digitorum and the articulations of the foot, and an internal, cutaneous in its distribu- tion. Beneath the peroneus tertius will be found, piercing the interosseous membrane, the anterior peroneal artery. On the foot, after the tibialis anticus and pero- neus tertius have been traced to their insertions, and the extensor poUicis to the great toe, the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum to the four outer toes are to be dissected out; also the extensor brevis digito- rum arising from the fore part of the os calcis and passing obliquely forwards and inwards to the four inner toes; and the nerve to that muscle is to be found coming from the external division of the anterior tibial. The continuation of the anterior tibial artery, called dorsal artery of the foot, is to be followed to its disappearance between the heads of origin of the first f2

138 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. from above downwards, left pulmonary artery^ left bronchus and left pulmonary veins, and along with these the left bronchial arteries given off from the aorta, and left bronchial vein opening usually into the superior intercostal. Then, continuing the dis- section backwards, the pleura is to be stripped from the aorta and from the back part of the thoracic wall, and the sympathetic ganglionic chain lying on the necks of the ribs is to be dissected out, together with the great splanchnic nerve arising by separate origins from different ganglia from about the fifth to about the ninth. The condition of the dissection of the abdomen will probably not allow these nerves to be displayed in the lower part hid by the convexity of the diaphragm till a later period. The courses of the sympathetic branches to the lung are to be exhibited from the ganglia; and the double connection of each ganglion with the corresponding spinal nerve should also be shown. The fat and connective tissue should be cleared away from the back part of the intercostal spaces, so as to show the intercostal nerves and arte- ries lying on the external intercostal muscles, and the posterior margins of the internal intercostals at some distance from the vertebrae. Also the arrangement of the intercostal veins is to be preserved, the lower veins followed into the left vena azygos, and those of the upper spaces followed so as to show whether they pour their blood into the vena azygos or left inno- minate vein, or both, as the case may be. The lung may then be replaced in its position. The right lung is next to be turned forwards, and the right pneumogastric nerve, lying outside the su-

134 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 1. The Parietes.â€”Before the fifth day after the subject has been placed on the back, the upper limbs should be removed by the dissectors of those parts, and then the dissection of the thorax may be com- menced. The external intercostal muscles should be dis- played in as great a part of their extent as possible; and they should be dissected away from some of the intercostal spaces, so as to show the direction of the internal intercostal muscles beneath them. Also the intercostal nerves of the upper six spaces may be shown between the muscles, and with them the intercostal arteries, each with its collateral branch running along the upper border of the rib below ; and the anastomoses of these arteries with the internal mammary should be made out. On the left side the course of the internal mammary artery may be exhibited by the removal of the second and four succeeding costal cartilages ; then, in order to exhibit the relations of the peri- cardium and pleural cavities to the thoracic walls, the corresponding costal cartilages of tlie other side may be divided close to the ribs, and the ribs on both sides whose cartilages have been divided may be re- moved, together with the subjacent pleura, back as

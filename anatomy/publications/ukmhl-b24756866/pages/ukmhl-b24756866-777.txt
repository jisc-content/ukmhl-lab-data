FEMORAL HERNIA —SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION. T67 abdomen; tlie circumflexa ilii vessels pass obliquely outwards along Poupart's ligament to the crest of the ilium; and the superficial external pudic vessels pass inwards to the perineal and scrotal regions. These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, which return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two groups, one of which is disposed parallel with Poupart's ligament; the other is placed below this ligament, surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and following (occasionally) the course of this vessel a short distance along the thigh. The upper chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the penis, scrotum, lower part of the abdomen, perineum, and buttock; the lower chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The nerves supplying the integument of this region are derived from the ilio- Fig. 383.—Femoral Hernia. Superficial Dissection. inguinal, the genito-crural, and anterior crural. The ilio-inguinal nerve may be found on the inner side of the internal saphenous vein, the terminal branch of the genito-crural nerve outside the vein, and the middle and external cutaneous nerves more external. The deep layer of superficial fascia should be divided in the same direction as the external incisions, and separated from the fascia lata; this is easily effected, from its extreme thinness. It is a thin but dense membrane, placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and »upon the surface of the fascia lata. It is

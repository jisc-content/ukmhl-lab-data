CAVITY OF LARYNX—GLOTTIS —VOCAL CORDS. 707 mem'hrane, inclosing ligamentous and muscular fibres, stretched between tbe sides of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilage: these are the aryteno- epiglottidean folds, on the margins of which the cuneiform cartilages form a more or less distinct whitish prominence. The cavity of the larynx extends from the aperture behind the epiglottis to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. It is divided into two parts by the projection inwards of the vocal cords and Thyro-arytenoid muscles; between the two cords is a long and narrow triangular fissure or chink, the glottis or rima glottidis. The portion of the cavity of the larynx above the glottis is broad and triangular in shape above, and corresponds to the interval between the alos of the thyroid cartilage; the portion bekrw the glottis is at first elliptical, and, lower down, of a circular form. The glottis or rima glottidis is the interval between the inferior vocal cords. The two superior or false vocal cords are placed above the latter, and are formed almost entirely by a folding inwards of the mucous membrane; whilst the two inferior or true vocal cords are thick, strong, and formed partly by mucous mem- brane, and partly by ligamentous fibres. Between the true and felse vocal cords, on each side, is an oval depression, the sinus or ventricle of the larynx, which leads upwards, on the outer side of the superior vocal cord, into a ctecal pouch of variable size, the sacculus laryngis. The rima glottidis is the narrow fissure or chink between the inferior or true vocal cords. It is the narrowest part of the cavity of the larynx, and cor. responds to the level of the arytenoid cartilages. Its length, in the male, measures rather less than an inch, its breadth when dilated varying at its widest part from a third to half an inch. In the female, these measure- ments are less by two or three lines. The form of the glottis varies. In a quiescent state, it is a narrow fissure, a little enlarged and rounded behind. In inspiration, it is widely open, some- what triangular, the base of the triangle directed backwards, and corresponding to the space between the separated arytenoid cartilages. In expiration, it is smaller than during inspiration. "When sound is produced, it is more narrowed, the margins of the aryte- noid cartilages being brought into contact, and the edges of the vocal cords approximated and made parallel; the degree of approximation and ten- sion corresponding to the height of the note produced. The superior or false vocal cords, so called because they are not directly concerned in the production of the voice, are two folds of mucous mem- brane, inclosing a delicate narrow fibrous band, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament. This ligament consists of a thin band of elastic tissue, attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage below the epiglottis, and behind to the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The lower border of this ligament, inclosed in mucous membrane, forms a free crescentic margin, which constitutes the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx.

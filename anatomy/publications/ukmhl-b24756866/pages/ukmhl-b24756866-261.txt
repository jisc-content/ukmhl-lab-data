255 SUPERFICIAL CERYICAL REGION. and thinner at each, extremity. It arises, by two heads, from the sternum and clavicle. The sternal portion arises by a rounded fasciculus, tendinous in front, fleshy behind, from the upper and anterior part of the first piece of the sternum, and is directed iipwards and backwards. The clavicular j^ortion arises from the inner third of the superior border of the clavicle, being composed of fleshy and aponeurotic fibres; it is directed almost vertically upwards. These two portions are separated from one another, at their origin, oy a triangular cellular interval; but become gradually blended, below the middle of the neck, into a thick rounded muscle, which is inserted, by a strong tendon, into the outer surface of the mastoid process, from the apex to its superior border, and by a thin aponeurosis into the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. This muscle varies much in its extent of attachment to the clavicle; in one case it may be as narrow as the sternal portion, in another as much as three inches in breadth. Fig. 153.—Muscles of the Neck, and Boundaries of the Triangles. When the clavicular origin is broad, it is occasionally subdivided into numerous slips, separated by narrow intervals. More rarely, the corresponding margins of the Sterno-mastoid and Trapezius have been found in contact. In the application of a ligature to the third part of the subclavian artery, it will be necessary, where the muscles have an arrangement similar to that above-mentioned, to divide a • portion of one or of both, in order to facilitate the operation. This muscle divides the quadrilateral space at the side of the neck into two triangles, an anterior and a posterior. The boundaries of the anterior triangle being, in front, the median line of the neck; above, the lower border of the body of the jaw, and an imaginary line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid

111 OS HYOIDES- at tlie front part of the upper wall. The opening of the sphenoidal sinuses is usually at the upper and back part of the nasal fossae, immediately behind the superior turbinated bone. The middle meatus is situated between the middle and inferior turbinated bones, and occupies the posterior two-thirds of the outer wall of the nasal fossa. It presents two apertures. In front is the orifice of the infun- dibulum, by which the middle meatus communicates with the anterior ethmoidal cells, and through these with the frontal sinuses. At the centre of the outer wall Fig. C7.â€”Inner Wall of Nasal Fossse, or Septum of Kose. is the orifice of the antrum, which varies somewhat as to its exact position in different skulls. The inferior meatus, the largest of the three, is the space between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It extends along the entire length of the outer wall of the nose, is broader in front than behind, and presents anteriorly the lower orifice of the lachrymal canal. Os Hyoides. The Hyoid bone is named from its resemblance to the Greek Upsilon; it is alsc called the lingual hone, from supporting the tongue, and giving attachment to its numerous muscles. It is a bony arch, shaped like a horseshoe, and consisting of five seg- pig. eS.-Hyoid Bone. Anterior Surface. ments, a central portion or body, two greater cornua, and two lesser cornua. The Body forms the central part of the bone, is of a quadrilateral form, its anterior surface (fig. 68), convex, directed forwards and upwards, is divided into two parts by a vertical ridge, which descends along the median line, and is crossed at right angles by a horizontal ridge, so that this surface is divided into four muscular depressions. At the point of meeting of these two lines is a

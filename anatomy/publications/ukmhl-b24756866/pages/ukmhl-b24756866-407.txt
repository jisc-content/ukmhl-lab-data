401 OF THE AXILLA. SuEGicAL Anatomy of the Axilla. The Axilla is a conical space, situated between tlie upper and lateral parts of the chest, and inner side of the arm. Boundaries. Its ajKx, which is directed upwards towards the root of the neck, corresponds to the interval between the first rib internally, the superior border of the scapula externallj, and the clavicle and Subclavius muscle in front. The base, ' directed downwards, is formed by the integument, and a thick layer of fascia, extending between the lower border of the Pectoralis major in front, and the lower border of the Latissimus dorsi behind; it is broad internally, at the chest, but narrow and pointed externally, at the arm. Its anterior houndary is formed by the Pectoralis major and Pectoralis minor muscles, the former covering the whole of Fig. 217.â€”The Axillary Artery and its Brandies. the anterior wall of the axilla, the latter covering only its central part. Its posterm houndary, which extends somewhat lower than the anterior, is formed by the Sub- scapularis above, the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi below. On the inner side are the first four ribs and their corresponding Intercostal muscles, and part of the Serratus magniis. On the outer side, where the anterior and posterior boundaries converge, the space is narrow, and bounded by the humerus, the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles. Contents. This space contains the axillary vessels, and brachial plexus of nerves with their branches, some branches of the intercostal nerves, and a large number of lymphatic glands; all connected together by a-quantity of fat and loose areolar tissue. 26

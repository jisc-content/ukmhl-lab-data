624 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The corpus fimhriatum, called also the taenia hippocampi, is a narrow, white, tape-like band, situated immediately behind the choroid plexus. It is the lateral edge of the posterior pillar of the fornix, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major as it descends into the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. It may be traced as far as the pes hippocampi. The tlialami optici and/orn<£c will be described when more completely exposed, in a later stage of the dissection of the brain. The middle cornu should now be exposed, throughout its entire extent, by introducing the little finger gently into it, and cutting through the hemisphere, between it and the surface, in the direction of the cavity. The middle or descending cornu, the largest of the three, traverses the middle lobe of the brain, forming in its course a remarkable curve round the back of the Fig. 268.—The Fornix, Velum Interpositum, and Middle or Descending Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle. optic thalamus. It passes, at first, backwards, outwards, and downwards, and then curves around the crus cerebri, forwards and inwards, nearly to the point of the middle lobe, close to the fissure of Sylvius. Its upper boundary is formed by the medullary substance of the middle lobe, and the under surface of the thalamus opticus. Its lower boundary presents for examination the following parts: The hippocampus major, pes hippocampi, pes accessorius, corpus fimhria- tum, choroid plexus, fascia de»tata, transverse fissure. The hippocampus major or cornu ammonis, so called from its resemblance to a ram's horn, is a white eminence, of a curved elongate form, extending along the

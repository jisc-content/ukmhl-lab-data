692 THE THORAX. Eacla of tliese cavities should now be separately examined. The Eight Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measiiring about one line; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity or sinus, and an appendix auriculte. The sinus is the large quadrangular-shaped cavity, placed between the two venae cavee; its walls are extremely thin, and it is connected below with the right Fig. 352.—Tlie Eight Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the anterior walls of both being removed. ventricle, and, internally, with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The cqjpendix auriculee, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular pouch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ■ventri- cular margin, from its right border to the appendix ; and, from the middle of this, a second inci- sion should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two venos cavse.

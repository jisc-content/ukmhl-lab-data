196 ARTICULATIONS. The Internal Lateral Ligament (fig. 122) is a long, thin, and loose tand, attached above to the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the inner margin of the dental foramen. Its outer Fig. 121.—Temporo-maxillary Articulation.

The Stylo-nn,axillary Ligament is a thin apo- neurotic cord, which ex- tends from near the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone, to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw, between the Masseter and In- ternal pterygoid mus- cles. This ligament separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and has attached to its inner side, part of the fibres of origin of the Stylo-glossus mtiscle. Although tisually classed among the ligaments of the iaw, it can only be considered as an accessory in the articulation.

ANTERIOR REGION OF THE SKULL. eminences and margins of tlie orbit; below, by tbe prominence of the cbin; on each, side, by tbe malar bone and anterior margin of the ramus of the jaw. In the median line are seen from above downwards, the nasal eminences, which indicate the situation of the frontal sinuses; diverging outwards from the nasal eminences are the superciliary ridges which support the eyebrows. Beneath the nasal eminences are the arch of the nose, formed by the nasal bones^ and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary. The nasal arch is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards, presenting in the median line the inter-nasal suture, formed between the nasal bones, laterally the naso-maxillary suture, formed between the nasal bone and the nasal process of the superior maxillary bones, both these sutures terminating above in that part of the transverse suture Fig. 65.â€”Anterior Region of the Skull. which, connects the nasal bones and nasal processes of the superior maxillary with the frontal. Below the nose is seen the heart-shaped opening of the ante- rior nares, the narrow end upwards, and broad below; it presents laterally the thin sharp margins which serve /or the attachment of the lateral cartilages of the nose, and in the middle line below, a prominent process, the anterior nasal spine, bounded by two deep notches. Below this is the intermaxillary suture, and on each side of it the incisive fossa. Beneath this fossa is the alveolar pro. cess of the upper and lower jaw, containing the incisor teeth, and, at the lower part of the median line, the symphysis of the chin, the mental eminence, and the incisive fossa of the lower jaw. Proceeding, from above downwards, on each side, is the supra-orbital ridge.

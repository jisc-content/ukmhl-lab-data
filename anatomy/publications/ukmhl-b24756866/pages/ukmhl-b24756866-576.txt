SPINAL NERVES. 5Y0 287.—Cutaneous Nerves of Riglit Upper Extremity. Posterior View. The cutaneous portion of tlie nerve passes behind the median cephalic vein, and divides, opposite the elbow-joint, into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch descends along the radial border of the forearm to the ■wrist. It is here placed in front of the radial artery, and, piercing the deep fascia, accompanies that vessel to the back of the wrist. It communicates with a branch from the radial nerve, and dis- tributes filaments to the integument of the ball of the thumb. The posterior branch is given off about the middle of the forearm, and passes downwards, along the back part of its radial side, to the wrist. It supplies the integument of the lower third of the forearm, communicating with the radial Berve, and the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve is one of the smallest branches of the brachial plexus. It arises from the inner cord, in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and, at its commence- ment, is placed on the inner side of the brachial artery. It passes down the inner side of the arm, pierces the deep fascia with the basilic vein, about the middle of the limb, and, becoming cutaneous, di- vides into two branches. This nerve gives offj near the axilla, a cutaneous filament, which pierces the fascia, and supplies the integument cover- ing the Biceps muscle, nearly as far as the elbow. This filament lies a little ex- ternal to the common trunk from which it arises. The anterior branch, the larger of the two, passes in front of, occasionally be- hind, the median basilic vein. It then descends on the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm, distributing filaments to the integument as far as the wrist, and communicating with a cuta- neous branch of the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch passes obliquely downwards on the inner side of the basilic vein, winds over the internal condyle of the humerus to the back of the forearm, and descends, on the posterior surface of its ulnar side, to a little below the middle, distributing filaments to the integument. It anastomoses above the elbow with the lesser internal cutaneous, and above the wrist with the dorsal branch of the ■ulnar nerve (Swan). The Lesser Internal Cutaneous Nerve (nerve of Wrisberg) is distributed to the xntegument on the inner side of the arm. It is the smallest of the branches of the brachial plexus, and usually arises from the inner cord, with the internal cutaneous

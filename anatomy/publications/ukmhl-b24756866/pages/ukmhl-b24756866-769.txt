IT^GUINAL HERNIA- SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION. T59 direction as the external incisions, separated from tlie aponeurosis of the External oblique, to which it is connected by delicate areolar tissue, and reflected down- wards and outwards. It is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength. It is intimately adherent, in the middle line, to the linea alba, and, below, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament and upper part of the fascia lata. It forms a thin tubular prolongation round the outer surface of the cord, which blends with the superficial layer, and is continuous Avith the dartos of the scrotum. From the back of the scrotum, the conjoined layers may be traced into the perineum, where they are continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia in this region, which is attached, behind, to the triangular ligament, and, on each side, to the ramus of the pubes and ischium. The connections of this fascia serve to explain the course taken by the urine in extravasation of this fluid from rupture of the urethra; passing forwards from the perineum into the scrotum, it ascends on to the abdomen, but is prevented extending into the thighs by the attachment of the fascia to the ramus of the pubes and ischium, on each side, and to Poupart's ligament in front. Fig. 380.â€”Inguinal Hernia. Superficial Dissection. The aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle is exposed, on the removal of this fascia. It is a thin, strong, membranous aponeurosis, the fibres of which are directed obliquely downwards and inwards. It is attached to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, the spine of the pubes, the pectineal line, front of the pubes, and linea alba. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends from the

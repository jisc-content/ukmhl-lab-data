663 STOMACH. transverse mesocolon; its lower border, with the peritoneum covering the caecum and ascending colon. It serves to retain the small intestines in their position, and contains between its layers the mesenteric vessels and nerves, the lacteal vessels, and mesenteric glands. The mesocsecum, when it exists, serves to connect the hack part of the c^cum with the right iliac fossa; more frequently, the peritoneum passes merely ia front of this portion of the large intestine. The ascending mesocolon is the fold which connects the back part of the ascend- ing colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen. The descending mesocolon retains the descending colon in connection with the posterior abdominal wall; more frequently, the peritoneum merely covers the anterior surface and sides of these two portions of the intestine. The transverse mesocolon is a broad fold, which connects the transverse colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is formed of the two ascending layers of the great omentum, which, after separating to surround the transverse colon, join behind it, and are continued backwards to the spine, where they diverge in front of the duodenum, as already mentioned. This fold contains between its layers the vessels which supply the transverse colon. The sigmoid mesocolon is the fold of peritoneum which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the left iliac fossa. The mesorectum is the narrow fold which connects the upper part of the rectum with the front of the sacrum. It contains the hemorrhoidal vessels. The appendices epiploicse are small pouches of the peritoneum filled with fat, and situated along the colon and upper part of the rectum. They are chiefly appended to the transverse colon. The Stomach, The Stomach is the principal organ of digestion. It is the most dilated part of the alimentary canal, serving for the solution and reduction of the food, which constitutes the process of chymification. It is situated in the left hypochondriac, the epigastric, and part of the right hypochondriac regions. Its form is irregularly conical, curved upon itself, and presenting a rounded base, turned to the left side. It is placed immediately behind the anterior wall of the abdomen, above the transverse colon, below the liver' and Diaphragm. Its size varies considerably in different subjects, and also according to its state of distension. When moderately full, its transverse diameter is about twelve inches, its vertical diameter about four. Its weight, according to Clendenning, is about four ounces and a half. It presents for examination two extremities, two orifices, two borders, and two surfaces. Its left extremity is called the greater or splenic end. It is the largest part of the stomach, and expands for two or three inches to the left of the point of entrance of the a3sophagus. This expansion is called the great cul-de-sac or fundus. It lies beneath the ribs, in contact with the spleen, to which it is connected by the gastro-splenic omentum. The lesser or pyloric end is much smaller than the preceding, and situated on a plane anterior and inferior to it. It lies in contact with the wall of the abdomen, the under surface of the liver, and the neck of the gall-bladder. The oesophageal or cardiac orifice communicates with the oesophagus; it is the highest part of the stomach, and somewhat funnel-shaped in form. The jjyloric orifice communicates with the duodenum, the aperture being guarded by a valve. The lesser curvature extends between the oesophageal and cardiac orifices, along the upper border of the organ, and is connected to the under surface of the liver by the lesser omentum. The greater curvature extends between the same points, along the lower border.

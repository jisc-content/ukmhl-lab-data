MUSCLES AND FASCIA. 328 Fig. 187.â€”Muscles of the Iliac and Anterior Femoral Regions. m. saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and pierced in this situation by numerous small bloodvessels and lymphatics, hence the name cribriform fascia, which has been applied to it. Subcutaneous bursse are found in the superficial fascia over the patella, point of the heel, and phalangeal articulations of the toes. The deep fascia of the thigh is exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, and is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata; it forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb, but varies in thickness in difierent parts; thus, it is thickest in the upper and outer side of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the Gluteus maxi- mus muscle, and the Tensor vaginae femoris is inserted between i.ts layers; it is very thin behind, and at the upper and inner side, where it covers the Adductor muscles, and again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving fibrous expansions from the tendon of the Biceps externally, and from the Sartorius, Gracilis, Semi-tendi- nosus, and Quadriceps extensor cruris in front. The fascia lata is attached, above, to Poupart's ligament, and crest of the ilium; behind, to the margin of the sa- crum and coccyx; internally, to the pubic arch and pectineal line ; and below, to all the prominent points around the knee- joint, the condyles of the femur, tuberosi- ties of the tibia, and head of the fibula. That portion which invests the Gluteus medius (the Gluteal aponeurosis) is very thick and strong, and gives origin by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of that muscle; at the upper border of the Gluteus maximus, it divides into two layers, the most superficial, very thin, covering the surface of the Gluteus maxi- mus, and is continuous below with the fascia lata; the deep layer being thick above, and blending with the great sacro-sciatic ligament, thin below, where it separates the Gluteus maximus from the deeper muscles. From the inner surface of the fascia lata, are given oft' two strong inter- muscular septa, which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera; the external and stronger one, which extends from the insertion of the Gluteus maximus, to the outer condyle, separates the Vastus externus in front from the short head of the Biceps behind, and gives partial origin to these muscles; the inner one, the

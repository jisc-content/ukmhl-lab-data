OS INNOMINATUM. 151 broad, and divided into an external lip, an internal lip, and an intermediate space. To the external lip is attached the Tensor vaginae femoris, Obliquus externns abdominis, and Latissimus dorsi, and by its whole length the fascia lata; to the interspace between the lips, the Internal oblique; to the internal li]), the Transversalis, Quadratiis lumborum, and Erector spin^. Fig. 98.â€”Right Os Innominatum. Internal Surface. The anterior border of the ilium is concave. It presents two projections separated by a notch. Of these, the uppermost, situated at the junction of the crest and anterior border, is called the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, the outer border of which gives attachment to the fascia lata, and the origin of the Tensor vaginae femoris; its inner border, to the Iliacus internus; whilst its extremity affords attachment to Poupart's ligament, and the origin of the Sartorius. Beneath this eminence is a notch which gives attachment to the Sartorius muscle, and across which passes the external cutaneous nerve. Below the notch is the anterior inferior spinous process, which terminates in the upper lip of the aceta- bulum ; it gives attachment to the straight tendon of the Eectus femoris muscle.

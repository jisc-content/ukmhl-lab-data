The inner three-fourths of this surface afford attachment to the Infra-spinatus muscle; the outer fourth is only covered by it, without giving origin to its fibres. This surface is separated from the axillary border by an elevated ridge, which runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, downwards and backwards to the posterior border, about an inch Fig. 85.â€”Left Scapula. Posterior Surface or Dorsum. above the inferior angle. This ridge serves for the attachment of a strong apon- eurosis, which separates the Infra-spinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between this line and the axillary border is narrow for the upper two-thirds of its extent, and traversed near its centre by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapulae vessels; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which glides the Latissimus dorsi; sometimes the latter muscle takes its origin by a few fibres from this part.

332 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. dicularly upon the head of the tibia, thus maintaining the entire weight of the body. The Eectus muscle assists the Psoas and Iliacus in supporting the pelvis and trunk upon the femur, or in bending it forwards. Fig. 188.â€”Muscles of the Internal Femoral Region. Internal Femoral i^EGioN, Gracilis. Pectineus. Adductor Longus. Adductor Brevis. Adductor Magnus. Dissection. These muscles are at once ex- posed by removing the fascia from the fore part and inuer side of the thigh. The limb should be abducted, so as to render the muscles tense, and easier of dissection. The Gracilis is the most superficial muscle on the inner side of the thigh. It is thin and flattened, broad above, narrow and tapering below. It arises by a thin aponeurosis between two and three inches in breadth, from the inner margin of the ramus of the pubes and ischium. The fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a rounded tendon which passes behind the internal condyle of the femur; curving round the inner tubero- sity of the tibia, it becomes flattened, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, below the tuberosity. The tendon of this muscle is situated immediately above that of the Semi-tendinosus, and beneath the aponeurosis of the Sartorius, with which it is in part blended. As it passes across the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, it is separated from it by a synovial bursa common to it and the Semi- tendinosus muscle. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the fascia lata and the Sartorius below; the internal saphenous vein crosses it obliquely near its lower part, lying superficial to the fascia lata. By its deep surface, with the three Adductors, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee- joint. The Pectineus is a flat quadrangular muscle, situated at the anterior part of the upper and inner aspect of the thigh. It arises from the linea ilio-pectinea, from the surface of bone in front of it, between the pectineal eminence and spine of the pubes, and from a tendinous prolongation of Gimbernat's ligament, which is attached

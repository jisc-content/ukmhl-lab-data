ORGANS OF THE SENSES. 624 consists of concentric layers, of whicli tlie external, in the fresh state, are soft and easily detaclied; those beneath are firmer, the central ones forming a hardened nucleus. These laminae are best demonstrated by Fig. 308.—The Crystalline Lens, boiling, or immersion in alcohol. The same reagents hardened and divided. demonstrate that the lens consists of three triangular (Enlarged.) segments, the sharp edges of which are directed towards the centre, the bases towards the circumference. The laminae consist of minute parallel fibres, which are united to each other by means of wavy margins, the convexities upon one fibre fitting accurately into the concavities of the adjoining fibre. The changes produced in the lens hy age are the fol- lowing :— In the foetus, its form is nearly spherical, its color of a slightly reddish tint, not perfectly transparent, and so soft as to readily break down on the slightest pressure. In the adult, the posterior surface is more convex than the anterior, it is color- less, transparent, and firm in texture. In old age, it becomes flattened on both surfaces, slightly opaque, of an amber tint, and increases in density. The suspensory ligament of the lens is a thin, transparent, membranous struc- ture, placed between the vitreous body and the ciliary processes of the choroid: it connects the anterior margin of the retina with the anterior surface of the lens, near its circumference. It assists in retaining the lens in its position. Its outer surface presents a number of folds or plaitings, in which the corresponding folds of the ciliary processes are received. These plaitings are arranged round the lens in a radiating form, and are stained by the pigment of the ciliary processes. The suspensory ligament consists of two layers, which commence behind, at the ora serrata. The external, a tough, milky, granular membrane, covers the inner surface of the ciliary processes, and extends as far forwards as their anterior free extremities. The inner layer, an elastic transparent, fibro-membranous structure, extends as far forwards as the anterior surface of the capsule of the lens, near its circumference. That portion of this membrane which intervenes between the ciliary processes and the carpsule of the lens, forms part of the boun- dary of the posterior chamber of the eye. The posterior surface of this layer is turned towards the hyaloid membrane, being separated from it at the circum- ference of the lens by a space called the canal of Petit. The canal of Petit is alDout one-tenth of an inch wide. It is bo^^nded in front by the suspensory ligament; behind, by the hyaloid membrane, its base being formed by the capsule of the lens. When inflated with air, it is sacculated at intervals, OAving to the foldings on its anterior surface. Bloodvessels and Neeves of the Eye. The Vessels of the globe of the eye are the short, long, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria centralis retinae. The short ciliary arteries pierce the back part of the sclerotic, round the entrance of the optic nerve, and divide into branches which run parallel with the axis of the eyeball: they are distributed to the middle layer of the choroid, and ciliary processes. The long ciliary arteries, two in number, pierce the back part of the sclerotic, and run forward, between this membrane and the choroid, to the Ciliary muscle, where they each divide into an upper and lower branch; these anastomose, and form a vascular circle round the outer circumference of the iris; from this circle branches are given off which unite, near the margin of the pupil, in a smaller vascular circle. These branches, in their course, supply the muscular structure. I

BRANCHES OP THE ULNAR. 415 The branclies of tlie ulnar artery may be arranged into the following groups:— Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent. T- , ( Anterior interosseous. Interosseous | p^^^^^-^^ interosseous. Muscular. Anterior carpal. Posterior carpal. Deep or communicating hrancli. Digital. Forearm. -{ Wrist. Hand. The anterior ulnar re- current arises immediately below the elbow-joint, passes upwards and inwards be- tween the Brachialis anticus and Pronator radii teres, supplies these muscles, and, in front of the inner con- dyle, anastomoses with the anastomotica magna and in- ferior profunda. The posterior ulnar re- current is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding. It passes backwards and inwards, be- neath the Flexor sublirais, and ascends behind the inner condyle of the hiimerus. In the interval between this eminence and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending be- tween the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve; it supplies the neigh- boring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recurrent arteries. The interosseous artery is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of con- siderable size, Avhich arises immediately below the tu- berosity of the radius, and, passing backwards to the upper border of the inter- osseous membrane, divides into two branches, the an- ■ terior and posterior inter- osseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, Fig. 221.—Arteries of the Back of the Forearm and Hand. .J}eecgneti-ng J3ranch from Anaslo mot lea Alugna, Poitenor Jiiteroiseou^ ( Vina

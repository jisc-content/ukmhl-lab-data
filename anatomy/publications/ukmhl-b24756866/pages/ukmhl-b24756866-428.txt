It passes upwards to the riglit side, between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches (right and left), which supply the cor- responding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the vena portae and hepatic duct. The hepatic artery, in its course.along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledochus and portal vein, the former lying to the right of the artery, and the vena portae behind. Its branches are the Pyloric. ^ , 1 T T ( Gastro-epiploica dextra. (iastro-duodenalis < -r, f- i i v Cystic. Pancreatico-duodenalis.

The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis is a short but large branch, which descends behind the duodenum, near the pylorus, and divides at the lower border of the stomach into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pancreatico-duodenalis. Previous to its division, it gives ofi" two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs from right to left along the greater curvature ■J

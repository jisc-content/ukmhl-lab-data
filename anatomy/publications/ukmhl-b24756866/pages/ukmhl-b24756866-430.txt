'iU ARTERIES. tlie superior mesenteric vein, and is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are the Inferior pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic. Vasa intestini tenuis. Colica dextra. Colica media. The inferior iMncreatico-duodenal is given off from the superior mesenteric below the pancreas, and is distributed to the head of the pancreas, and the trans- verse and descending portions of the duodenum ; anastomosing with the pancrea- tico-duodenal artery. Fig. 225.â€”The Superior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. The vasa tnteshm tenuis arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are distributed to the jejunum and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery; each vessel dividing into two branches, which unite with a similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches, the convexities of which are directed towards the intestine. From this first set of arches branches arise, which again unite with similar branches from either side, and thus a second series of arches is formed; and from these latter, a third, and even a fourth or fifth series of arches is constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intes- tine. From the terminal arches numerous small straight vessels arise which encircle the intestine, upon which they are minutely distributed, ramifying between its coats.

209 SCAPULO-CLAYICIJLAR. of tlie two bones. It is in relation, above, witli tlie interarticular fibro-cartilage (when it exists) and the synovial membranes; below, with the tendon of the Supra-spinatus. These two ligaments are contimions with each other in front and behind, and form a complete capsule around the joint. The Coraco-clavicular Ligament serves to connect the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula. It consists of two fasciculi, called the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. The Trapezoid ligament, the anterior and external fasciculus, is a broad, thin, quadrilateral-shaped band of fibres, placed obliquely between the coracoid process and the clavicle. It is attached, below, to the upper surface of the coracoid Fig. 131.â€”The Jjelt Shoulder-joint, Scapnlo-clavicular Articulations, and Proper Ligaments of Scapula, process; above, to the oblique line on the under surface of the clavicle. Its anterior border is free; its posterior border is joined with the conoid ligament, the two forming by their junction a projecting angle. The Conoid ligament, the posterior and internal fasciculus, is a dense band of fibres, conical in form, the base being turned upwards, the summit downwards. It is attached by its apex to a rough depression at the base of the coracoid process, internal to the preceding; above, by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle, and into a line proceeding internally from it for half an inch. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius; behind, with the Trapezius: they serve to limit rotation of the scapula forwards and backwards. The Interarticular Fihro-cartilage is most frequently absent in this articulation. "When it exists, it generally only partially separates the articular surfaces, and

ARTERIES. 380 spread out between the dura mater and internal surface of the cranium, some passing upwards over the parietal bone as far as the vertex, and others backwards to the occipital bone. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal, and on the inner surface of the parietal bone divides into branches which supply the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of this vessel are distributed to the dura mater, but chiefly to the bones; they anastomose Fig. 210.â€”The Internal Maxillary Artery, and its Branches. with the arteries of the opposite side, and with the anterior and posterior menin- geal. The middle meningeal, on entering the cranium, gives off the following colla- teral branches: 1. Numerous small vessels to the ganglion of the fifth nerve, and to the dura mater in this situation. 2. A branch to the facial nerve, which enters the hiatus Fallopii, supplies the facial nerve, and anastomoses with the stylo- mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. 3. Orbital branches, which pass through the sphenoidal fissure, or tlirough separate canals in the great wing of the sphenoid, to anastomose with the lachrymal or other branches of the oph- thalmic artery. 4. Temporal branches, which pass through foramina in the great wing of the sphenoid, and anastomose in the temporal fossa with the deep temporal arteries. The small meningeal is sometimes derived from the preceding.* It enteis the skull through the foramen ovale, and supplies the Casserian ganglion and dura

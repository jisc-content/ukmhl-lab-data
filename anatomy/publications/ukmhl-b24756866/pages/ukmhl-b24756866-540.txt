534 NERYOrS SYSTEM. The inferior peduncles {jprocessus admedullam) connect the cerebellum with the medulla ol)lougata. They pass downwards to the back part of the medulla, and form part of the restiform bodies. Above, the fibres of each process are con- nected chiefly with the laminae, on the upper surface of the cerebellum; and below, they are connected with all three tracts of one half of the medulla, and, through these, with the corresponding half of the cord, excepting the posterior median columns. The middle -peduncles {j^rocessus ad ponteni), the largest of the three, connect together the two hemispheres of the cerebellum, forming their great transverse commissure. They consist of a mass of curved fibres, which arise in the lateral parts of the cerebellum, and pass across to the same points on the opposite side. They form the transverse fibres of the pons Yarolii.

INFRA-HYOID REGION. 2^ raiiscle is separated, below, from its fellow by a considerable interval; but they aiDproach one another in the middle of their course, and again diverge as they ascend. It often presents, immediately above its origin, a transverse tendinous intersection, analogous to those in the Eectus abdominis. Variations. This muscle sometimes arises from the inner extremity of the clavicle, and the posterior sterno-clavicular ligament, or from the sternum and this ligament; from either bone alone, or from all these parts; and occasionally has a fasciculus connected with the cartilage of the first rib. Relations. By its swperjicial surface, below, with the sternum, sternal end of the clavicle, and the Sterno-mastoid; and above, Avith the Platysma and deep cervical fascia. By its deep surface, with the Sterno-thyroid, Crico-thyroid, and Thyro-hyoid muscles, the thyroid gland, the superior thyroid vessels, the crico-thyroid and thyro-hyoid membranes. Fig. 154.—Muscles of the Neck. Anterior View. The Sterno-thyroid is situated beneath the preceding muscle, but is shorter and wider. It arises from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, below the origin of the Sterno-hyoid, and occasionally from the edge of the cartilage of the first rib, and is inserted into the oblique line on the side It ■ of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is in close contact with its fellow at the lower part of the neck; and is frequently traversed by a trans- verse or oblique tendinous intersection, analogous to those in the Eectus i abdominis. Variations. This muscle is sometimes continuous with the Thyro-hyoid and Inferior con- strictor of the pharynx; and a lateral prolongation from it sometimes passes as far as the- ©s hyoides. 17

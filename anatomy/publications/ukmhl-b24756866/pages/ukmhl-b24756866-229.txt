223 KNEE-JOINT. 2. Knee-joint. The knee is a ginglymoid or hinge-joint; the bones entering into its formation are, the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front. The articular surfaces are covered with cartilage, and connected toge- ther by ligaments, some of which are placed on the exterior of the joint, whilst others occupy its interior. External Ligaments, Anterior or Ligamentum Pa- tellae. Posterior or Ligamentum Posticum Winslowii. Internal Lateral. Two External Lateral. Internal Ligaments. Anterior or External Crucial. Posterior or Internal Crucial. Two Semilunar Fibro-cartilages. Transverse. Coronary. Ligamentum mucosum. Ligamenta alaria. Capsular. The Anterior Ligament or Ligamentum Palellee (fig, 139) is that portion of the common tendon of the extensor muscles of the thio-h which is continued from Fig. 139.—Right Knee-joint. Anterior View.

Posterior View. the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, supplying the place of an anterior ligamenL It is a strong, flat, ligamentous band, about three inches in length, attached, above, to the apex of the patella and the rough depression on its posterior surface; below, to the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia; its superficial fibres being continu- ous across the front of the patella with those of the tendon of the Quadriceps ex- tensor. Two synovial bursse are connected with this ligament and the patella; one is interposed between the patella and the skin covering its anterior surface; the

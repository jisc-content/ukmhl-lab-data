THE EYE. 615 eyeballs are nearly parallel, and do not correspond to the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the axes of the orbits, and enter the eyeball a little to their inner or nasal side. The eyeball is composed of several investing tunics, and of fluid and solid refracting media, called humors. The tunics are three in number:— 1. Sclerotic and Cornea. 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary Processes. 3. Retina. The refracting media or humors are also three:— Aqueous. Crystalline (lens) and Capsule. Vitreous. The sclerotic and cornea form the most external tunic of the eyeball; they are essentially fibrous in structure, the sclerotic being opaque, and forming the pos- terior five-sixths of the globe; the cornea, which forms the remaining sixth, being transparent. Tunics of the Eye. scleeotio and cornea. The Sclerotic {ax%r,poi, hard) has received its name from its extreme density and hardness; it is a firm, unyielding, fibrous membrane, serving to maintain the peculiar form of the globe (fig. 303). It is much thicker behind than in front. Fig. 303.—A Vertical Section of the Eyeball. (Enlarged.) Its external surface is of a white color, quite smooth, except at the points where the Recti and Obliqui muscles are inserted into it, and covered, for part of its extent, by the conjunctival membrane; hence the whiteness and brilliancy of the front of the eyeball. Its inner surface is stained of a brown color, marked by grooves, in which are lodged the ciliary nerves, and connected by an exceedingly fine cellular tissue {lamina fusca) with the outer surface of the choroid. Behind, it is pierced by the optic nerve a little to its inner or nasal side, and is continuous with its fibrotis sheath, which is derived from the dura mater. At the point where the optic nerve passes through the sclerotic, this membrane forms a thin cribriform

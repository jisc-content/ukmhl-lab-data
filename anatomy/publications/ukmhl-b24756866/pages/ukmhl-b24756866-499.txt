OF THE INTESTINES AND THORAX. 493 former originating in tlie subserous, and tlie latter in the submucous coat. They follow the course of the bloodvessels, and may consequently be arranged into three groups. The first group accompany the coronary vessels along the lesser curvature, receiving branches from both surfaces of the organ, and pass to the glands around the pylorus. The second group pass from the great end of the stomach, accompany the vasa brevia, and enter the splenic lymphatic glands. The third group run along the greater curvature with the right gastro-epiploic vessels, and terminate at the root of the mesentery in one of the principal lacteal vessels. The lympliatic glands of the spleen occupy the hilus. Its lymphatic vessels consist of two sets, superficial and deep; the former are placed beneath its peritoneal covering, the latter in the substance of the organ: they accompany the blood- vessels, passing through a series of small glands, and, after receiving the lymphatics from the pancreas, ultimately pass into the thoracic duct. The Lymphatic System of the Intestines. The lymphatic glands of the small intestine are placed between the layers of the mesentery, occupying the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric vessels, and hence called mesenteric glands. They vary in number from a hundred to a hundred and fifty ; and in size, from that of a pea to that of a small almond. These glands are most numerous, and largest, superiorly near the duodenum, and inferiorly opposite the termination of the ileum in the colon. The latter group become greatly enlarged and infiltrated with deposit in cases of fever accompanied with ulceration of the intestines. The lymphatic glands of the large intestine are much less numerous than the mesenteric glands; they are situated along the vascular arches formed by the arteries previous to their distribution, and even sometimes upon the intestine itself. They are fewest in number along the transverse colon, where they form an unin- terrupted chain with the mesenteric glands. The lymphatics of tlie small intestine are called lacteals, from the milk-white fluid they usually contain; they consist of two sets, superficial and deep; the former lie beneath the peritoneal coat, taking a longitudinal course along the outer side of the intestine; the latter occupy the submucous tissue, and course transversely round the intestine, accompanied by the branches of the mesenteric vessels: they pass between the layers of the mesentery, enter the mesenteric glands, and finally unite to form two or three large trunks, which terminate in the thoracic duct. The lympliatics of the large intestine consist of two sets: those of the csecum, ascending and transverse colon, which, after passing through their proper glands, enter the mesenteric glands; and those of the descending colon and rectum, which pass to the lumbar glands. The Lymphatics of the Thoeax. The deep lymphatic glands of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammary, anterior mediastinal, and posterior mediastinal. The intercostal glands are small, irregular in number, and situated on each side of the spine, near the costo-vertebral articulations, some being placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles. The internal mammary glands are placed at the anterior extremity of each intercostal space, by the side of the internal mammary vessels. The anterior mediastinal glands are placed in the loose areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, some lying upon the Diaphragm in front of the pericardium, and others round the great vessels at the base of the heart. The posterior mediastinal glands are situated in the areolar tissue in the posterior mediastinum, forming a continuous chain by the side of the aorta and oesophagus:

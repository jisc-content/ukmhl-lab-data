5t4 SPINAL NERVES. Fig. 289.â€”The Suprascapular, Circumflex, and Musculo-spiral Nerves. Supra-Scajiular Oircumfia along the ulnar side of the wrist and hand, supplies the inner side of the little finger, and the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers; it also sends a com- municating filament to that branch of the radial nerve which supplies the adjoining sides of the middle and ring fingers. The articular filaments to the wrist are also supplied by the ulnar nerve. The superficial palmar branch supplies the Palmaris brevis, and the integument on the inner side of the hand, and terminates in two digital branches, which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, the other to the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers, the latter com- municating with a branch from the median. The deep palmar branch passes between the Abduc- tor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin, it supplies the muscles of the little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand it sends two branches to each interos- seous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous mus- cle, the branches to the second and third Palmar interossei supplying fila- ments to the two inner Lumbrical muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index-finger, it supplies the Adductor pol- licis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The MuscuLO-SPiKAL ISTekve (fig. 289), the largest branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the mus- cles of the back part of the arm and forearm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus by a com- mon trunk with the cir- cumflex nerve. At its commencement, it is placed behind the axillary and upper part of the brachial arteries, passing down in front of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major. It winds round tarerseous

112 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. Tlie communicating branch between the epigastric and obturator lies in front of the ring. The circumference of the ring is thus seen to be bounded by vessels in every part excepting internally and behind. It is in the former position that the stric- ture is divided in cases of strangulated femoral hernia. Fig. 386.â€”Hernia. The Relations of the Femoral and Internal Abdominal Rings, seen from within the Abdomen. Eight Side. The oUurator arterTj, when it arises by a common trunk with the epigastric, which occurs once in every three subjects and a half, bears a very imjDortant relation to the crural ring. In some cases (fig. 387) it descends on the inner side of the external iliac vein to the obturator foramen, and will consequently lie on the outer side of the crural ring, where there is little danger of its being wounded in the operation for dividing the stricture in femoral hernia. Occasionally, how- Variations in Origin and Course of Obturator Artery. Fig. 387. Fig. 388. ever, this vessel curves along the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament in its passage to the obturator foramen; it would, consequently, skirt along the greater part of the circumference of the crural canal, and could hardly fail in being wounded in the operation (fig. 888). Septum Crurale. The femoral ring is closed by a layer of condensed areolar tissue, called, by J. Cloquet, the septum crurale. This serves as a barrier to the protrusion of a hernia through this part. Its upper surface is slightly concave,

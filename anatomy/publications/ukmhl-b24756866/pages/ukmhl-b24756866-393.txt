Its relation with the tonsil should be especially remembered, as instances have occurred in which the artery has been wounded, during the operation of scarifying the tonsil, and fatal hemorrhage has super- vened. The brandies given off from the internal carotid are:— From the Petrous Portion From the Cavernous Portion From the Cerebral Portion Tympanic. i Arteria receptaculi. I Anterior meningeal. ( Ophthalmic, r Anterior cerebral. J Middle cerebral. 1 Posterior communicating. [ Anterior choroid. The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches. The tympanic is a small branch which enters the cavity of the tympanum, through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and stylo-mastoid arteries. The arterix receptaculi are numerous small vessels, derived from the internal carotid in the cavernous sinus; they supply the pituitary body, the Casserian gan- glion, and the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. One of these branches, distributed to the dura mater, is called the anterior meningeal; it anas- tomoses with the middle meningeal. The Ophthalmic Artery arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel is emerging from the cavernous sinus, on the inner side of the anterior clinoid Fig. 213.—The Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Roof of the Orbit having been removed.

THE THORAX. 696 The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of commiinication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding- opening on the opposite side. The musculi pectinati are fewer in number and smaller than on the right side; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum aviricularum may be seen a lunated impres- sion, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of Avhich is turned upwards. This depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. The Left Yextkicle is longer and more conical in shape than the right ven- tricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the heart by its projection beyond the right ventricle. Its walls are much thicker than those of the right ventricle, the proportion being as 2 to 1 (Bi%ot). They are also thickest in the broadest part of the ventricle, becoming gradually thinner towards the base, and also towards the apex, which is the thinnest part. Its cavity should be opened by making an incision through its anterior wall along the left side of the ventricular septum, and carrying it round the apex and along its posterior surface to the auriculo-ventricular opening. The following parts present themselves for examination:— Fig. 353.—The Left Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. Chordce tendinete. Columnaa carnese.

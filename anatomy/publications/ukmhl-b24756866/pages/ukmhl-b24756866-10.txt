( iv ) AMERICAN PUBLISHEES' NOTICE. The present edition, like the last American reprint, has been passed through the press under the supervision of Dr. Richard J. Dunglison, who has carefully corrected whatever errors had escaped the attention of the author, and has made such changes in the typographical arrangement as seemed calculated to render the volume more convenient for consulta- tion and reference. February, 1862.

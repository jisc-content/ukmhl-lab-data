( y ) PREFACE. In preparing a Second Edition of my " Descriptive and Surgical Anatomy," I trust that I have corrected any inaccuracies contained in the previous one; every page has been carefully revised; much addi- tional matter has been added to the text; and several new Illustrations, executed with great care and fidelity by Dr. Westmacott, have been inserted. December, 1860.

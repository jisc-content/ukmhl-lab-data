INTERNAL CAROTID. 385 vertically downwards behind the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, to terminate in the Subclavian; it receives the transverse cervical and suprascapular veins, which occasionally form a plexus in front of the artery, and a small vein which crosses the clavicle from the cephalic. The small nerve to the Subclavius also crosses this space about its centre. Internal Carotid Artery. The Internal Carotid Artery commences at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and ascends perpen- dicularly upwards, in front of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae, to the carotid foramen in the petrous portion of the temporal bone.

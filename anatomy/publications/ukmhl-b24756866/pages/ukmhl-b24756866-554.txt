The branches of this nerve may be divided into three groups: 1. Those given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa. 2. Those in the infra-orbital canal. 3. Those on the face. ( Orbital.

The Orbital hmnch arises in the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides at the back of that cavity into two branches, temporal and malar. Fig. 280.â€”Distribution of the Second and Third Divisions of the Fifth Nerve and Submaxillary Ganglion. The temporal branch runs in a groove along the outer wall of the orbit (in the malar bone), receives a branch of communication from the lachrymal, and, passing through a foramen in the malar bone, enters the temporal fossa. It ascends between the bone and substance of the Temporal muscle, pierces this muscle and the temporal fascia about an inch above the zygoma, and is distributed to the integument covering the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The malar branch passes along the external inferior angle of the orbit^ emerges

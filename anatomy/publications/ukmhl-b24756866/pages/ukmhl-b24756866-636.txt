630 ORGANS OF THE SENSES. number. Of these, one is a strong fibrous band, stretching across from the tragus to the commencement of the helix, completing the meatus in front, and partly encircling the boundary of the concha; the other extends between the concha and the processus caudatus. The muscles of the pinna{?\g. 312), like the ligaments, also consist of two sets :â€” 1. Those which connect it with the side of the head, moving the pinna as a whole, viz., the Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, and Retrahens aurem (p. 241). 2. The proper muscles of the pinna, which extend from one part of the auricle to another. These are the Helicis major. Antitragicus. Helicis minor. Transversus auriculae. Tragicus. Obliquus auris. The Helicis major is a narrow, vertical band of muscular fibres, situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises, below, from the tubercle of the helix, and is inserted into the anterior border of the helix, just where it is about to curve backwards. It is pretty constant in its existence. The Helicis minor is an oblique fasciculus, firmly attached to that part of the helix which commences from the bottom of the concha. The Tragicus is a short, flattened band of muscular fibres, situated upon the outer surface of the tragus, the direction of its fibres being vertical. The Antitragicus arises from the outer part of the antitragus; its fibres are inserted into the processus caudatus of the anti helix. This muscle is usually very distinct. The Transversus auriculse is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of radiating fibres, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the convexity of the concha to the prominence corresponding with the groove of the helix.

The radial nerve lies along the outer side of the artery, in the middle third of its course; and some filaments of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, after piercing the deep fascia, run along the lower part of the artery as it winds round the wrist. The vessel is accompanied by vense comites throughout its whole course. Plan of the Eelations of the Kadial Aetery in the Foeeaem. In front. Integument, superficial and deep fasciae.

At the wrist, as it winds round the outer side of the carpus, from the styloid process to the first interosseous space, it lies upon the external lateral ligament, being covered by the Extensor tendons of the thumb, subcutaneous veins, some filaments of the radial nerve, and the integument. It is accompanied by two veins, and a filament of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. In the hand, it passes from the upper end of the first interosseous space, between the heads of the Abductor indicis, transversely across the palm, to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, where it inosculates with the communi- eating branch from the ulnar artery, forming the deep palmar arch. It lies iipon the carpal extremities of the metacarpal bones and the Interossei muscles, being covered by the Flexor tendons of the fingers, the Lumbricales, the muscles of the little finger, and the Flexor brevis pollicis, and is accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Peculiarities. The origin of the radial artery varies nearly in the proportion of one case in eight. In one case the origin was lower than usual; in the others, the upper part of the brachial was a more frequent source of origin than the axillary. The variations in the position of this vessel in the arm, and at the bend of the elbow, have been already mentioned. In the forearm it deviates less frequently from its position than the ulnar. It has been found lying over the fascia, instead of beneath it. It has also been observed on the surface of the Supinator longus, instead of along its inner border; and in tui-ning round the wrist, it has been seen lying over, instead of beneath, the Extensor tendons. _ Surgical Anatomy. The operation of tying the radial artery is required in cases of wounds either of its trunk, or of some of its branches, or for aneurism; and it will be observed, that the vessel may be easily exposed in any part of its course through the forearm. The operation in the middle or inferior third of this region is easily performed; but in the upper third, near the elbow, the operation is attended with some difficulty, from the greater depth of the vessel, and from its being overlapped by the Supinator longus and Pronator radii teres muscles. To tie the artery in this situation, an incision three inches in length should be made through the integument, from the bend of the elbow obliquely downwards and outwards, on the radial side of the forearm, avoiding the branches of the median vein; the fascia of the arm being

221 HIP-JOINT. AETICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTEEMITY. The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following groups. 1. The hip-joint. 2. The knee-joint. 3. The articulations between the tibia and fibula. 4. The ankle-joint. 5. The articulations of the tarsus. 6. The tarso- metatarsal articulations. 7. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. 8. The articulation of the phalanges. 1. Hip-joint (fig. 138). This articulation is an enarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint, formed by the reception of the head of the femur into the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum. The articulating surfaces are covered with cartilage, that on the head of the femur being thicker at the centre than at the circumference, and covering the entire surface with the exception of a depression just below its centre for the ligamen- tum teres; that covering the acetabulum is much thinner at the centre than at the circumference, being deficient in the situation of the circular depression at the bottom of this cavity. The ligaments of the joint are the Capsular. Teres. Ilio-'femoral. Cotyloid. Transverse. Fig. 138.â€”Left Hip-joint laid open. The Capsular Ligament is a strong, dense, ligamentous capsule, embracing the margin of the acetabulum above, and surrounding the neck of the femur below. Its Mpjjer circumference is attached to the acetabulum two or three lines external to the cotyloid ligament; but, opposite the notch where the margin of this cavity is deficient, it is connected with the transverse ligament, and by a few fibres to the edge of the obturator foramen. Its lower circumference surrounds the neck of the femur, being attached, in front, to the spiral or anterior inter-trochanteric' line; above, to the base of the neck; behind, to the middle of the neck of the bone, about half an inch from the posterior inter-trochanteric line. It is much thicker

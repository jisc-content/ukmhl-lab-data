426 ARTERIES. along the back part of the rectum as far as the middle of the sacrum before it divides; this is about a finger's length or four inches from the anus. In disease Fig. 226.â€”The Inferior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. of this tube, the rectum should never be divided beyond this point in that direc- tion, for fear of involving the artery. Supra-renal Arteries. The Supra-renal Arteries are two small vessels which arise, one on each side of the aorta, opposite the superior mesenteric artery. They pass obliquely iipwards and outwards, to the under surface of the supra-renal capsules, to which they are distributed, anastomosing with capsular branches from the phrenic and renal arteries. In the adult these arteries are of small size; in the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. Eenal Arteries. The Eenal Arteries are two large trunks, which arise from the sides of the aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is directed out- wards, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The right one longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta, passes behind the inferior vena cava. The left is somewhat higher than the right. Previously to entering the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches, which are distributed to its substance. At the hilum, these branches lie between the renal vein and

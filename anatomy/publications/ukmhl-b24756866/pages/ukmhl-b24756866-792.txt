Y82 SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. pass tlirough it. It arises, in front, from the posterior surface of the body and ramiis of the pubes, on the outer side of the symphysis; posteriorly, from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium; and, between these two points, from the angle of division between the obturator and recto-vesical layers of the pelvic fascia at their under part: the fibres pass downwards to the middle line of the floor of the pelvis, and are inserted, the most posterior fibres into the sides of the apex of the coccyx; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous raphe, which extends between the coccyx and the margin of the anus. The middle fibres, which form the larger portion of the muscle, are inserted into the side of the rectum, blending with the fibres of the Sphincter muscles: lastly, the anterior fibres, the longest, descend upon the side of the prostate gland to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, blending with the fibres of the External sphincter and Transversus perinei muscles, at the tendinous centre of the perineum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by cellular tissue. From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with the prostate gland, descending by its side and surrounding it as in a sling, it has been described by Santorini and others as a distinct muscle, under the name of the Levator prostatse. In the female, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani descend upon the sides of the vagina. Relations. By its upper or pelvic surface with the recto-vesical fascia, which separates it from the viscera of the pelvis and from the peritoneum. By its outer or perineal surface, it forms the inner boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa; is covered by a quantity of fat, and by a thin layer of fascia continued from the obturator fascia. Its p)Osterior horder is coutinuoiis Avith the Coccygeus muscle. Its anterior border is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a triangular space, through which the urethra, and, in the female, the vagina passes from the pelvis. Actions. This muscle supports the lower end of the rectum and vagina, and also the bladder during the efforts of expulsion. The Goccyrjeus is situated behind and parallel with the preceding. It is a triangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, arising, by its apex, from the spine of the ischium and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and is inserted, by its base, into the margin of the coccyx and into the side of the lower piece of the sacrum. This jnuscle is continuous Avith the posterior border of the Levator ani, and closes in the back part of the outlet of the pelvis. Relations. By its inner or pelvic surface, with the rectum. By its external surface, with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. By its posterior border, with the Pyriformis. Action. The Coccygei muscles raise and support the coccyx after it has been pressed backwards during defecation or parturition. PoPiition of the Viscera at the Outlet of the Pelvis. Divide the centraltendinons point of tlie perineum, and separate the rectum from its connections by dividing the fibres of the Levator ani, which descend upon the sides of the prostate gland, turn it backwards towards the coccyx, when the under surface of the prostate gland, the neck and base of the bladder, the vesiculae seminales, and vasa deferentia will be exposed. The Prostate Gland is placed immediately in front of the neck of the bladder, around the prostatic portion of the urethra, its base being turned backwards, and its under surface towards the rectum. It is retained in its position by the Levator prostatse and by the pubo-j^rostatic ligaments, and is invested by a dense fibrous covering, continued from the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. The longest diameters of this gland are in the antero-posterior direction, and trans- versely at its base; and hence the greatest extent of incision that can be made in it, without dividing its substance completely across, is obliquely outwards and backwards. This is the direction in which the incision is made through it in the operation of lithotomy, the extent of which should seldom exceed an inch in length. The relations of the prostate to the rectum should be noticed: by means

SPINAL CORD. 505 Fig. 257.—Transverse Section of the gray substance of the spinal cord, near the middle of the dorsal region. Magnified 13 diameters. a variable length become superficial. The longitvclinal fibres are more superficial, run nearly parallel with each other, and form the greater portion of the white columns. The gray nubstance of the cord con- sists of, 1. Nerve fibres of variable, but smaller, average diameter than those of the columns. 2. Nerve cells of various shapes and sizes, with from two to eight processes. 3. Bloodvessels and con- nective tissue. Each lateral half of the gray sub- stance is divided into an anterior and posterior horn, and the tractus inter- medio lateralis, or lateral part of the gray substance between the anterior and posterior cornua. The posterior horn consists of two parts, the caput cornu, or expanded ex- tremity of the horn (fig. 257), round which is the lighter space or lamina, the gelatinous substance; and the cervix cornu, or remaining narrow portion of the horn, as far forwards as the central canal. The gelatinous substance contains along its border a series of large nerve cells ; but more internally consists of a stratum of small cells traversed by transverse, oblique, and longitudinal fibres (figs. 258 and 259). Fig. 258.—Transverse Section of the gray substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement. On tlie left side the groups of large cells are seen; on the right side the course of the fibres witliout the cells. Magnified 13 diameters. Nearly the whole inner half of the cervix is occupied by a remarkable and important column of nerve cells, called the posterior vesicular column (fig. 257), which varies in size and appearance in different regions of the cord, and is intimatelv connected with the posterior roots of the nerves.

INNOMINATE. 469 three large arteries arising from tlie arch of the aorta. This vessel is joined by the left vertebral, left inferior thyroid, left internal mammary, and the left supe- rior intercostal veins, and occasionally some thymic Fig. 241.â€”The Vense Cavse and Azygos Veins, with their Formative Branches. and pericardiac veins. There are no valves in the venae innominatas. Peculiarities. Sometimes the innominate veins open se- parately into the right auri- cle ; in such cases the right vein takes the ordinary course of the superior vena cava, but the left vein, after communi- cating by a small branch with the right one, passes in front of the root of the left lung, and, turning to the back of the heart, receives the cardiac veins, and terminates in the back of the right auricle. This occasional condition of the veins in the adult is a regular one in the foetus at an early period, and the two ves- sels ' are persistent in birds and some mammalia. The subsequent changes which take place in these vessels are the following : 'J'he communi- cating branch between the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left innominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is' obliterated as far as the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coro- nary sinus; a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band {)assing along the back of the eft auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called, by Mr. Marshall, the vestigial fold of the pericardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corre- sponding with those de- rived from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, commu- nicating with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in SiinpriarTh. zEscferiial Jugular

?64 MUSCLES AND FASCIJE. carotid, tlie internal jugular vein, the Superior constrictor, Palato-pharyngeus and mucous membrane. Nerves. The muscles of this group are supplied by branches from the pharyn- geal plexus and glosso-pharyngeal nerve; and the Inferior constrictor, by an addi- tional branch from the external laryngeal nerve. Actions. When deglutition is about to be performed, the pharynx is drawn upwards and dilated in different directions, to receive the morsel propelled into it from the mouth. The Stylo-pharyngei, which are much farther removed from one another at their origin than at their insertion, draw upwards and outwards the sides of this cavity, the breadth of the pharynx in the antero-posterior direction being increased by the larynx and tongue being carried forwards in their ascent. As soon as the morsel is received in the pharynx, the elevator muscles relax, the bag descends, and the Constrictors contract upon the morsel, and convey it gradually downwards into the oesophagus. The pharynx also exerts an important influence in the modulation of the voice, especially in the production of the higher tones. Dissection (fig. 157). Lay open the pharynx from behind, by a vertical incision extending from its upper to its lower part, and partially divide the occipital attachment by a transverse incision on each side of the vertical one; the posterior surface of the soft palate is then exposed. Having fixed the uvula so as to make it tense, the mucous membrane and glands should be care- fully removed from the posterior surface of the soft palate, and the muscles of this part are at once exposed. 6.

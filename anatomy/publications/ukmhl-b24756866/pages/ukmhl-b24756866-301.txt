ANTERIOE THORACIC REGION. 295 the middle, and tlie middle the lower portion, the fibres of the lower portion being folded backwards upon themselves; so that those fibres which are lowest in front, become highest at their point of insertion. Thej all terminate in a flat tendon, about two inches broad, which is inserted into the anterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. This tendon consists of two laminse, placed one in front of the other, and usually blended together below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the cla- vicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscles; the posterior lamina Fig. IGO.â€”Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm. Superficial View. receiving the attachment of the lower half of the sternal portion. From this arrangement it results, that the fibres of the upper and middle portions of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the bicipital ridge; those of the lower portion, into the upper part. The tendon, at its insertion, is connected with that of the Deltoid; it sends up an expansion over the bicipital groove to the head of the humerus, another backwards, Avhich lines the groove, and a third to the fascia of the arm.

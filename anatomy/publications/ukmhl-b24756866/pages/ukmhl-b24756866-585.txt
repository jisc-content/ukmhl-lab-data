LUMBAR PLEXUS. 579 forming tlie anterior crural and obturator nerves. The fourtli nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and the obturator, furnishes part of the accessory obturator, and gives ofi* a communicating branch to the fifth lumbar. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric. Obturator. Ilio-inguinal. Accessory obturator. Genito-crural. Anterior crural. External cutaneous. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen: the other group, which includes the remaining nerves, supplies the forepart of the thigh and inner side of the leg. Fig. 290.â€”Tlie Lumbar Plexus and its Brandies. The Ilio-hypogasteic "nterve (superior muscuh-cutaneous) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It pierces the outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in front of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its back part, and divides betw;een it and the Internal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric. I

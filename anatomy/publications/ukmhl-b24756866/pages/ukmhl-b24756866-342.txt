V 336 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. Fig. 190.—Muscles of the Hip and Thigh. Ten Jo £ARTOR lus CR ACI LIS SCMI"TCNDINOSUS iEMI-MCMSRAHOSUS separates the tendon of the muscle from the surface of the trochanter in front of its insertion. Relations. By its superfi- cial surface, with the Gluteus maximus behind, the Tensor vaginae femoris and deep fas- cia in front. By its deep surface, with the Gluteus mi- nimus and the gluteal vessels and nerve. Its anterior bor- der is blended with the Glu- teus minimus. Its posterior border lies parallel with the Pyriformis, the gluteal vessels intervening. This muscle should now be divided near its insertion and turned up wards, when the Gluteus minimus will be exposed.* The Gluteus Minimus, the smallest of the three glutei; is placed immediately beneath the preceding. It is fan- shaped, arising from the outer surface of the ilium, between the middle and inferior curved lines, and behind, from the margin of the great sacro- sciatic notch; the fibres con- verge to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, which, terminating in a tendon, is inserted into an impression on the anterior border of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon and the great tro- chanter. Belations. By its superfi- cial surface, with the Gluteus medius, and the gluteal vessels and nerve. By its deep sur- face, with the ilium, the re- flected tendon of the Eectus femoris, and capsular liga- ment of the hip-joint. Its anterior margin is blended with the Gluteus medius. Its posterior margin is often joined with the tendon of the Pyriformis. The Pyriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape, lying almost parallel with :1

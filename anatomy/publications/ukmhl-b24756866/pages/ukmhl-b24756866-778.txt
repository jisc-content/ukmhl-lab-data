768 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. intimately adherent above to the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, and about one inch below this ligament covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels corresponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, and by numerous blood- vessels and lymphatics; hence it has been termed, from its sieve-like appearance, the cribriform.fascia. ,A femoral hernia, in passing through the saphenous open- ing, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. The deep layer of superficial fascia, together with the cribriform fascia, having been removed, the fascia lata is exposed. The Fascia Lata, already described (p. 328), is a dense fibrous aponeurosis, which forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb. At the upper and inner part of the thigh, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed in it; it transmits the internal saphenous vein and other small vessels, and is called the sajihenous opening. In order the more correctly to consider the mode of Fig. 384.â€”Femoral Hernia, showing Fascia Lata and Saphenous Opening. formation of this aperture, the fascia lata in this part of the thigh is described as consisting of two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion of the fascia lata is situated on the outer side of the saphenous opening, covering the outer surface of the Sartorius, the Eectus, and the Psoas and Iliacus muscles. It is attached externally to the crest of the ilium and its anterior superior spine, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament as far internally as the spine of the pubes, and to the pectineal line in conjunction with Gimber-

OF THE MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 321 Fig. 180.â€”Fracture of the Middle of the Clavicle. wards, and, together with the scapula, raised upwards to a level with the inner fragment, and retained in that position. In fracture of the acromial end of lite cla- vicle between the conoid and trapezoid liga- ments, only slight displacement occurs, as these ligaments, from their oblique insertion, serve to hold both portions of the bone in apposition. Fracture, also, of the sternal end, internal to the costo-clavicular ligament, is attended with only slight displacement, this ligament serving to retain the fragments in close apposition. Fracture of the acromion process usually arises from violence applied to the upper and outer part of the shoulder; it is generally known by the rotundity of the shoulder being lost, from the Deltoid drawing downwards and forwards the fractured portion; and the dis- placement may easily be discovered by tracing the margin of the clavicle outwards, when the fragment will be found resting on the front and upper part of the head of the humerus. In order to relax the anterior and outer fibres of the Deltoid (the opposing muscle), the arm should be drawn forwards across the chest, and the elbow well raised, so that the head of the bone may press upwards the acromion process, and retain it in its position. Fracture of the coracoid process is an ex- tremely rare accident, and is usually caused by a sharp blow on the point of the shoulder. Displacement is here produced by the com- bined actions of the Pectoralis minor, short head of the Biceps, and Coraco-brachialis, the former muscle drawing the fragment inwards, the latter directly downwards, the amount of displacement being limited by the connection of this process to the acromion by means of the coraco-acromial ligament. In order to relax these muscles, and replace the fragments in close apposition, the forearm should be flexed so as to relax the Biceps, and the arm drawn forwards and inwards across the chest so as to relax the (Joraco-brachialis ; the humerus should then be pushed upwards against the coraco-acromial ligament, and the arm retained in this position. Fracture of the anatomical neck of the /iumerits within the capsular ligament is a rare accident, attended with very slight displacement, an impaired condition of the motions of the joint, and crepitus. Fracture of the surgical neck (fig. 181) is very common, is attended with considerable displace- ment, and its appearances correspond somewhat with those of dislocation of the head of the humerus into the axilla. The upper fragment is slightly elevated under the coraco-acromial ligament by the muscles attached to the greater and lesser tuberosities; the lower fragment is drawn inwards by the Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major; and the humerus is thrown obliquely outwards from the side by the Deltoid, and occasionally elevated so as to project beneath and in front of the coracoid process. By fixing the shoul- der, and drawing the arm outwards and downwards, the deformity is at once reduced. To counteract the action of the opposing muscles, and to keep the fragments in posi- tion, the arm should be di'awn from the side, and pasteboard splints applied on its four sides; a large conical-shaped pad should be placed in the axilla with the base turned upwards, and the elbow approximated to the side, and retained there by a broad roller passed round the chest; the forearm should then be flexed, and the hand supported in a sling, care being taken not to raise the elbow, otherwise the lower fragment may be displaced upwards. 21 Fifr. 181. -Fracture of the Surgical Neck of the Tlumerus.

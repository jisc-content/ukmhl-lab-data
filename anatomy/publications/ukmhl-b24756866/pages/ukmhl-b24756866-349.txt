POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 343 Posterior Tibio-fibular Eegion. Dissection (fig. 189). Make a vertical incision along the middle line of the back of the leg, from the lower part of the popliteal space to the heel, connecting it below by a transverse incision extending between the two malleoli; the flaps of integument being removed, the fascia and muscles should be examined. The muscles in this region of the leg are subdivided into two layers, superficial and deep. The superficial layer constitutes a powerful muscular mass, forming what is called the calf of the leg. Its large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular apparatus in man, and bears a direct connection Avith his ordinary attitude and mode of pro- gression, 13^1 imill^y l\ Fig. 102.â€”Muscles of the Back of tlie Leg. Superficial Layer. Superficial Layer. Gastrocnemius. Plantaris. Soleus. The Gastrocnemius is the most super- ficial muscle, and forms the greater part of the calf. It arises by two heads, which are 'connected to the condyles of the femur by two strong flat tendons. The inner head, the larger, and a little the most posterior, is attached to a depression at the upper and back part of the inner condyle; the oi;ter head, to the upper and back part of the external condyle, immediately above the origin of the Popliteus. Both heads, also, arise by a few tendinous and fleshy fibres from the ridges which are continued upwards from the condyles to the linea aspera. Each tendon spreads into an aponeurosis, which covers the posterior surface of that por- tion of the muscle to which it belongs; that covering the inner head being longer and thicker than the outer. From the anterior surface of these tendinous ex- pansions, muscular fibres are given ofl:'; those in the median line, Avhich cor- respond to the accessory portions of the muscle derived from the bifurcations of the linea aspera, unite at an angle upon a median tendinous raphe below. The remaining fibres converge to the posterior surface of an aponeurosis which covers the front of the muscle, and this, gradu- ally contracting, unites with the tendon of the Soleus, and forms with it the tendo Achillis. delations.

t80 SUKGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. In tlie lateral operation of lithotomy, the knife is carried obliquely across the back part of this space, downwards and outwards, into the ischio-rectal fossa, dividing the Transversus perinei muscle and artery, the posterior fibres of the Accelerator urinas, the superficial perineal vessels and nerve, and, more posteriorly, the external hemorrhoidal vessels. The superficial and transverse perineal arteries are described at p. 434 • and the superficial perineal and inferior pudendal nerves, at pp. 586, 588. The Accelerator urinse and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perineal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb ; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. Fig. 392.—Deep Perineal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior layer has been removed. The muscles of the perineum in the female are the Sphincter vaginfe. Compressor urethra. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter ani. Transversus perinei. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter Vaginse surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinse in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perineum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perinei is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginaa, and

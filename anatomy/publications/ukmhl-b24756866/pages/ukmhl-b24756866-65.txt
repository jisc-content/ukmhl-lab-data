OCCIPITAL BONE. 59 tubercle for tlie attacliment of the ligaments (check) which connect this bone with the odontoid process of the axis; whilst external to them is a rough tubercular prominence, the transverse or jugular process (the representative of the trans- verse process of a vertebra), channelled in front by a deep notch, which forms part of the jugular foramen. The under surface of this process afibrds attach- ment to the Eectus capitis lateralis; its upper or cerebral surface presents a deep groove, which lodges part of the lateral sinus, whilst its prominent extremity is marked by a quadrilateral rough surface, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and articulating with a similar surface on the petrous portion of the temporal bone. On the outev side of each condyle, near its forepart, is a foramen, the anterior condyloid; it is directed downwards, outwards, and forwards, and trans- mits the hypoglossal nerve. This foramen is sometimes double. Behind each condyle is a fossa,' perforated at the bottom by a foramen, the posterior condyloid, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the foramen magnum is a strong quadrilateral plate of bone, the basilar process, wider behind than in front; its under surface, which is rough, presenting in the median line a tubercular ridge, the pharyngeal spine, for the attachment of the tendinous raphe and Superior constrictor of the pharynx; and on each side of it are rough depressions for the attachment of the Eectus capitis anticus major, and Rectus capitis minor. Fig. 23.â€”Occipital Bone : Inner Surface. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 23) is deeply concave. The posterior ' This fossa presents many variations in size. It is usually shallow, and the foramen small; occasionally wanting, on one, or both sides. Sometimes both fossa and foramen are large, but confined to one side only; more rarely, the fossa and foramen are very large on both sides.

OF THE ABDOJkiEN. 283 pillar, being attaclied to the front of the symphysis pubis, interlaces with the cor- responding fibres of the opposite muscle, that of the right being superficial. To the margins of the pillars of the external abdominal ring is attached an exceedingly thin and delicate fascia, which is prolonged down over the outer surface of the cord and testis. This has received the name of intercolumnar fascia, from its attachment to the pillars of the ring. It is also called the external spermatic fascia, from being the most external of the fasciae which cover the spermatic cord. Relations. By its external surface, with the superficial fascia, superficial epi- gastric and circumflex iliac vessels, and some cutaneous nerves. By its internal surface, with the Internal oblique, the lower part of the eight inferior ribs, and Intercostal muscles, the Cremaster, the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female. Its posterior border is occasionally overlapped by the Latissimus dorsi; sometimes an interval exists between the two muscles, in which is seen a portion of the Internal oblique. Dissection. The External oblique should now be detached by dividing- it across, just in front of its attachment to the ribs, as far as its posterior border, and by separating it below from the crest of the ilium as far as the spine; the muscle should then be carefully separated from the Internal oblique, which lies beneath, and turned towards the opposite side. The Internal Ohlique Muscle (fig. 16-i), thinner and smaller than the preceding, Fig. 1G4.â€”The Internal Oblique Jluscle. beneath which it lies, is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, and situated at the side and fore part of the abdomen. It arises, by fleshy fibres, from the outer half

421 CCELIAC AXIS. CcELiAC Axis. To expose this artery, raise the liver, draw down the stomach, and then tear through the layers of the lesser omentum. The Cceliac Axis is a short thick trunk, about half an inch in length, arising from the aorta, opposite the margin of the Diaphragm, and, passing nearly hori- zontally forwards (in the erect posture), divides into three large branches, the gastric, hepatic, and splenic, occasionally giving off one of the phrenic arteries. Relations. It is covered by the lesser omentum. On the right side, it is in relation with the right semilunar ganglion, and the lobus Spigelii. On the left side, with the right semilunar ganglion and cardiac end of the stomach. Below, it rests upon the upper border of the pancreas. Fig. 223.â€”The Cojliac Axis and its Brandies, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum removed. The Oastric Artery {Coronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the cceliac axis, passes upwards and to the left side, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, distributing branches to the oesophagus, which anastomose with the aortic cBsophageal arteries; others supply the cardiac end of the stomach, inoscu- lating with branches of the splenic artery; it then passes from left to right, along the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pylorus, lying in its course between the layers of the lesser omentum, and giving branches to both surfaces of the organ; at its termination it anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The Hepatic Artery in the adult is intermediate in size between the gastric and splenic; in the foetus, it is the largest of the three branches of the cceliac

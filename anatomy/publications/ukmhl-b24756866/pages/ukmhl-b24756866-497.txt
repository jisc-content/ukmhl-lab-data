OF THE PELVIS AND ABDOMEN. 491 In the female, the lymphatic vessels of the mucous membrane of the labia, nymplijB, and clitoris, terminate in the tipper chain of the inguinal l3fmphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the pelvis and abdomen take the course of the principal bloodvessels. Those of the parietes of the pelvis, which accompany the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac artery, and ultimately join the lumbar lymphatics. Fig. 252.â€”The Deep Lymphatic Vessels ami Glands of the Ahdomen and Pelvis. The efferent vessels from the inguinal glands enter the pelvis beneath Poupart's ligament, where they lie in close relation with the femoral vein; they then pass through the chain of glands surrounding the external iliac vessels, and finally terminate in the lumbar glands. They receive the deep epigastric, circumflex iliac, and ilio-lumbar lymphatics.

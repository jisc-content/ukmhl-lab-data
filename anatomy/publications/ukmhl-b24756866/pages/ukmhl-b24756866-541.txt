535 Cranial Nerves. The Cranial Nerves, nine in number on each side, include tliose nerves wliicli arise from some part of the cerebro-spinal centre, and are transmitted through foramina in the base of the cranium. They have been named numerically, according to the order in which they pass out of this cavity. Their names are also derived from the part to which each is distributed, or from the special function appropriated to each. Taken in their order, from before backwards, they are as follows :— 1st. Olfactory. Yth i ^^^"^^^ Portio dura. 2d. Optic. \ Auditory or Portio mollis. 3d. Motor oculi. ( Glosso-pharyngeal. 4th. Pathetic. 8th. -j Pneumogastric or Par vagum. 5th. Trifacial or Trigemini. ( Spinal accessory. 6th. Abducens. 9th. Hypoglossal. If, however, the 7th pair be considered as two, and the 8th pair as three distinct nerves, then their number will be increased to twelve, which is the arrangement adopted by Scimmering. The cranial nerves may be subdivided into four groups, according to the peculiar function possessed by each, viz., nerves of special sense; nerves of common sensation; nerves of motion; and mixed nerves. These groups may be thus arranged :— 1. Nerves of Special Sense. 2. Nerves of Motion. ry^n , Motor oculi. • Olfactory. ^^^^^^.^^ Auditory °^ ^"^"^^^ division of fifth (de- Part of glosso-pharyngeal (described ^^^i^^'?' ^^^^^ ^^^'^ ^^^^ under the eighth pair, p. 655). .

All the cranial nerves are connected to some part of the surface of the brain. This is termed their superficial or apparent origin. But their fibres may, in all cases, be traced deeply into the substance of the organ. This would form their deep or real origin. 1. Nerves of Special Sense, Olfactory Nerve. The First or Olfactory Nerve, the special nerve of the sense of smell, may be regarded as a portion of the cerebral substance, pushed forwards in direct relation with the organ to which it is distributed. It arises by three roots. The external or long root is a narrow white medullary band, which passes outwards across the fissure of Sylvius, into the substance of the middle lobe of the cerebrum. Its deep origin may be traced to the corpus striatum', the superficial fibres of the optic thalamus', the anterior commissure^, and the convolutions of the island of Eeil. '.

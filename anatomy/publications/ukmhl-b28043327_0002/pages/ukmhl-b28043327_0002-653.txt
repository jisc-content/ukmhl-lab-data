625 ■ CHAPTER XLIV. OF LACTATION.—THE LACTEAL GLANDS. NIPPLE. MINUTE STRUC- ! TURE OF THE GLAND. BLOOD-VESSELS. ABSORBENTS. MILK. I The Lacteal Glands are two large, symmetrical organs, which. are only fully developed in the female. In the male, however, ; they exist in a very rudimentary state. During the later half of pregnancy, the lacteal glands increase very much in size; and about the period of parturition, they begin to secrete milk. They I are racemose glands, and are ultimately composed of numerous ' roundish follicles, arranged round the terminal extremities of the ducts. The structure of the lacteal glands formed the subject of a very ! important investigation by Sir Astley Cooper. The lacteal tubes are about twenty in number, and terminate at the extremity of the nipple, by as many orifices. The ducts are Fig. 294.

This proeess, according to Langenheck, is completed between the twelfth and twentieth Aveek. The urachus, between the bladder and umbihcus, remains tubular long after this, and even at birth in some few instances; in which cases urine has been known to escape from the umbilicus. Allantoic Fluid is clear, of a brownish-yellow colour. Its specific gravity varies from 1005 to 1030. It contains alkaline lactates, 203. extractive matters, and ammoniacal salts, with alkaline and earthy phos- phates, and chlo- ride of sodium. Be- sides these, however, there is a definite crystallizable sub- stance peculiar to this fluid, termed allantoin, which is closely related to uric acid; indeed, it may he prepared artificially from this substance, while urea is produced at the same time. The composition of al- lantoic fluid seems nearlyidenticalwith that of the urine of calves while suckl- ing, at which time it contains no hip- puric acid. This latter substance, however, makes its appearance in the as soon as the animal takes vegetable food.

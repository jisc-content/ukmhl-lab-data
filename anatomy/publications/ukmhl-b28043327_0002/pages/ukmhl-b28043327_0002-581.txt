CHAP. XXXVIII.] OVUM. 55a Fig. 264. wliicli is attached to tlic external clear membrane, or zona pdlucida, of the ovum. This layer is termed by Dr. Barry, the tunica granu- losa. The so called retinacula are composed of similar cells, of which many are also found floating in the fluid of the follicle, which is entirely lined by them. Ovum.—The ovum is invested with a clear, homogeneous, perfectly transparent, firm, elastic, and toler- ably thick membrane, exhibiting an appearance, when examined by the microscope, very similar to that of the elastic laminae of the cornea, the vitelline or yolk membrane, or zona pellucida; the latter being the term always employed in speaking of the mammalian ovum. The zona pellu- cida appears as a perfectly clear ring, limited on either side by a well de- fined dark outline. Within this mem- brane is the yolk, which is composed of a fluid containing proper yolk granules and oil particles, with the clear bright germinal vesicle, contain- ing within it the germinal spot, lying close beneath the zona pellucida. The ovum is about j4-o th, and the germinal spot about j-o^j-o^h to -g^-oth of an inch in diameter. The yolk granules differ much in size and form in different animals. They are much more numerous in A?: Mammalian ova. The upper figure shows an ovum at an early stiige of development. The second figure, a mature ovum. a. Zona pellucida. b. Yolk. c.

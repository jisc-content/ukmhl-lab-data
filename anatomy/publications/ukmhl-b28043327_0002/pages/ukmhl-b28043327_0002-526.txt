Composition of healthy Urine.—The urine is a highly complex fluid, and contains substances having very different properties. Its constituents are composed partly of organic, and partly of inorganic compounds which are held in solution in the aqueous portion of the secretion. A small quantity of car- bonic acid gas is likewise often found held in solution. The chief organic constituents of healthy m’ine are the following: urea, uric or lithic acid, and certain extractive matters, with small quantities of creatine, creatinine, hip- puric and lactic acids, and ammoniacal salts. The inorganic constituents consist of certain salts which enter into the composition of the food, but * Diseases of the Kidney, by George Johnson, M.D.

94 INNERVATION. I CHAP. XVIII. tension of the memhrana tympani, and, on the other hand, the * contraction of the internus mallei depresses the stapes, and conse- quently increases the tension of the membranes of the two fenestraj. The cessation of muscular action restores all three membranes to . their original laxity, nor does it appear that they admit of any fur- ther degree of relaxation through the influence of any vital process. ■ The incus forms a bond of union between the two other bones, > and its motions depend entirely upon theirs in consequence of its ar- ' ticulation with both, while from the fixedness of its connexion with •• the mastoid cells, as well as from its intermediate position and '■ want of muscular attachment, its motions must obviously be much more limited than those of the other bones. Its use seems to be to complete the chain in such a manner, that by reason of its double articulation with the malleus on the one hand and the stapes on the other, the tension of the tympanic membranes may be > regulated without any sudden or violent motion, which could scarcely ; be avoided were the conductor between the membranes of the tym- r panum and fenestra ovalis but one piece of bone. The mobility of the tympanic bones has, however, a further use, t as Muller suggests ; namely, to favour the oscillations of the mem- ■ brana tympani, by allowing the approximation of the two extremi- ■ ties of the chain of bones. And this opinion is strengthened by the '■ facts of comparative anatomy, for the ossicles have moveable articu- ' lations in the frog, as in man, although they have no muscles at- / tached to them. The addition of a cavity filled with air outside the labyrinth has a twofold use. First, to preserve uniformity of temperature in the ' air immediately in contact with’ the fenestral membranes. Were these membranes situate on the exterior of the head, and exposed to the surrounding atmosphere, they would be constantly under- going changes in their elastic state, under the influence of atmo- spheric vicissitudes. The air which accumulates in the tympa- ^ num and mastoid cells, finds its way into them only through the Eustachian tubes, and as it does not readily change its position, it is well placed for maintaining a temperature equal to that of the body. Secondly, the action of the chain of ossicles as conductors is materially enhanced by their being completely surrounded by air. The insulation of a solid body by a different medium renders it a better propagator of sound; for the surrounding medium will obviate the dispersion of sound, and will favour its retention in the solid con- ductor. It results from Savart’s experiments, that tension of the mem-

Male Organs of Generation.—The essential organ of generation, or the secreting portion of the sexual apparatus, in the male, is the testicle. The efferent duct is the vas deferens, which opens into the membranous portion of the urethra, and connected with it are the vesieulse seminales and Cowper’s glands. The urethra is con- tinued forwards along the lower part of the penis, or intromittent organ. Testicles.—Each testicle is rather less than two inches in length, and is nearly one inch broad.—Its weight is about six drachms. The testicle is covered by a firm, fibrous, inelastic tunic, or proper covering, the tunica albuginea or tunica propria, consisting almost entirely of white fibrous tissue, in the substance of which vessels ramify. It is with difficulty divided into two layers, the inner of which is the most vascular. Adhering closely to the tunica albu- ginea, is the visceral layer of the serous membrane, or tunica vaginalis, the sac of which was originally formed by the descent of the testicle from the abdomen, when it carries before it a process of peritoneum. In early life, the cavities of the tunica vaginalis and peritoneum are continuous with each other; and, occasionally, the opening remains unclosed in the adult. The parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis is loose, and united by lax areolar tissue to the other structures which form the scrotum. This layer of the serous membrane admits of considerable distension; and, in disease, a very large quantity of serous fluid will sometimes accumulate in the sac, and distend it to a great extent {hydrocele?). Structure of the Gland.—The secreting portion of the organ con- sists of a vast number of minute and highly tortuous tubes, which

CHAP. XXXIV.] COMPOSITION OF HEALTHY HEINE. 499 which are not required for the wants of the system, and salts which, having perfoi-med certain offices by their passage through the tissues, are no longer required, and certain other saline compounds, which, like many of the organic constituents, are formed by oxidation in the processes concerned in nutrition. The inorganic salts are composed of chlorides, sulphates, and phosphates, with traces of silica, and the bases entering into the compo- sition of these salts are, potash, soda, lime, and magnesia. It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the precise composition of the salts as they were ori- ginally held in solution in the urine; for, in the processes of evaporation, and subsequent incineration, certain decompositions take place, which en- tirely alter their nature. The quantities in which these substances occur, vary in different specimens of urine, and the published analyses of the se- cretion in a healthy state, will be found to differ considerably from each other. This difference arises chiefly from the variation in the proportion of water ; for, by calculating the relation existing between the quantities of the several solid constituents, it will be found to be nearly the same in all. The following is an analysis of healthy human urine, by Dr. MiUer. The per-centage composition of the solid matter is shown in a separate column. Specific gravity, 1-020 in loo of Solid matter.

The quantity, however, is much increased by exercise, or by a purely animal diet. According to Lehmann, when a highly nitrogenous diet is taken, a quantity of urea equal to nearly five-sixths of the nitrogenous matter intro- duced is eliminated by the kidneys. A considerable quantity of urea, how- ever, is formed when no food whatever is taken, or when a non-uitrogenous diet is adhered to for a considerable period, which clearly shows that a large proportion of urea is derived from the disintegi-ation of the tissues, by the process of secondary assimilation. It is often detected in abnormal quantity in the urine of patients suflering from rheumatism, and certain febrile com- plaints, and, in various diseases, it may sometimes be obtained from this fluid in very lai-ge quantities. This condition is very commonly associated

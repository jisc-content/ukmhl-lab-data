72 [chap. XVIII. INNERVATION. of the organ of hearing, and includes tlie ultimate distribution of the nerve. It consists of three parts, the vestibule, the semi-circular canals, and the cochlea, all of which, from their delicacy and mi- nuteness of structure, demand careful examination. They are J a series of cavities hidden in the hardest part of the petrous bone, ^ communicating on the outside with the tympanum, by the fenestrso ^ ovalis and rotunda already described, and on the inside with the ; internal auditory canal, which conveys the nerve to them. The ^ very compact bone immediately bounding these cavities, considered -j! apart from the less dense bone which surrounds it, is termed the ^ osseous lah^rintJi, in distinction from a membranous labyrinth y within. Of the Osseous Labyrinth.—The singularly complex shape of this ' part of the oi’gan makes it difficult to describe. 1. The nestihule ; or common central cavity, placed immediately to the inner side of ♦. the tympanum, is flattened from side to side, and about a fifth of [ Osseous labjTinth of the left side. o. Fenestra ovalis, leading into the cavity of the vestibule From this a bristle, f, is passed into v u, the vestibular scala of the cochlea, which is laid open in part by the removal of the outer wall. r. Fenestra rotunda, seen almost in profile. Through this a bristle, is passed into the tympanic scala of the cochlea, t ty exposed by the removal of part of the membranous portion of the lamina spiralis. The three semicircular canals are seen, with their extremities entering the vestibule, ana one end of each dilated into an ampulla. Mag- nified 3j diameters. Partly from Sccmmerring. an inch in height, as well as from before backwards. The semi- circular canals open into it by five orifices behind, the cochlea by a single one in front; on its outer wall is the fenestra ovalis, on its inner several minute holes, including the macula cribrosa for the

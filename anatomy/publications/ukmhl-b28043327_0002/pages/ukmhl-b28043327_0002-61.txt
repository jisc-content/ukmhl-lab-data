33 THE CRYSTALLINE LENS. ( I ( i j i i i I i i CHAP. XVII. would act rather on the vitreous body around the lens, than on the lens itself. Its existence may be easily shown by filling it with mercury or air, through an artificial orifice in its anterior wall. The injected fluid fills out the plaitings of the ciliary processes. The refracting index of the vitreous body is about 1‘339, that of water beino- 1’336, so that the difference between them is very trifling, and may be referred in part to the transparent fibrous tissue. Its chemical constitution, according to Berzelius, is as follows: Water ....... 98-40 Cliloride of Sodium, with extractive matter . 1‘42 Albumen ...... ‘18 100-00 In early life the vitreous body gives passage by a canal to a branch of the central artery of the retina to the back of the lens; and in large animals, though not in man, this appears to supply some branches to the vitreous body itself even in the adult state. The crystalline, as already mentioned, is a double convex lens ; but its surfaces are of unequal curvature, the posterior being the more convex. In the adult the difference is nearly as 4 to 3, but it is liable to some variety in different subjects. Chossat has observed that the curvatures of the lens in the ox are ellipsoids of revolution round the lesser axis, but whether they are so in man is not determined: the subject is one very difficult Fig. i2i. of investigation.

The lens also varies in consistence with age; being very soft at an early period, very Arm in declining years. At no epoch of life, however, is it of uniform consistence throughout; being always denser and firmer from without inwards. In the adult its diameter is from Uo i of an inch, and its antero- posterior axis about J to J of an inch. It weighs from three to four grains. The lens is divided into capsule and body. The manner in which it is encased and fixed by the cajisule in the vitreous body, has been VOL. II. D

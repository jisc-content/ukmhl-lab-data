The finest capillaries, such as may be most easily examined in connexion with the pia-mater of the brain, appear to consist of a homogeneous tissue, interrupted at short intervals by nuclei which adhere to, or are imbedded in, the wall of the vessel. (Fig-195 a.) These nuclei are mostly ovalâ€”sometimes nearly circular; most of them have their long axes directed parallel to the course of the vessel, but some are placed transversely. In some of these fine capillaries very faint indications of a circular striation may be seen. In some larger vessels, which perhaps may with more propriety he regarded as capillary arteries, rather than as true capillaries, a distinct arrangement of circular fibres may be seen. These fibres are flat, uniform in diameter, devoid of nuclei, and in all re.spects, but this, resemble the unstriped muscular fibres. It had long been a question among physiologists, whether the capillaries had proper walls distinct from the tissues to which they VOL. II. z

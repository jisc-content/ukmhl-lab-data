CHAP. XXVIIt.] 321 COATS OF ARTERIES. lowing tunics may be enumerated as constituting the wall of an artery proceeding from without inwards. Epithelial particles from the aorta of an ox. Magnified 400 diameters. Particles of epithelium and nuclei from the aorta of a horse; some of the former exhibit the elongated character. Mag. 200 diam. First, the external coat consisting of areolar tissue. Second, the circular fibrous coat, consisting of a series of lamellaj, composed of yellow elastic fibrous tissue, the most external of which are intermingled with white fibrous tissue and with circular muscular fibres. Third, the longitudinal fibrous layer, which consists of two layers, a finely fibrous, and a coarsely fibrous. And lastly, a layer of epithelium. The internal layer of longitudinal fibres—which is the same as that described by Henle under the name of fenestrated membrane— constitutes, along with the epithelium, the internal tunic so long recognised by anatomists. The elastic reaction of arteries is evidently resident in the middle fibrous coat, and in the same tunic the contractile power of the artery resides. The existence of these two forces in the arterial wall, the one of simple elastic reaction, the other of a slow muscular contraction, is shown by the well-known experiments of John Hunter. A piece taken from each of the large arteries of a horse bled to death was laid open and extended on a flat surface without stretching; it was then measured, and afterwards subjected to strong tension, it was then measured again; on the removal of the stretching force it failed to recover itself to its first dimensions hy a notable difference. When an animal has been bled to death, the

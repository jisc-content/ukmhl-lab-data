They form a series of concentric layers, in number proportioned to the thicknessof the artery, composed of coarse yellow fibres which branch and interlace freely.

Certain large fibres or rods of yellow elastic tissue are disposed in successive concentric circles which pass transversely, and sometimes obliquely round the artery. (Figs. 187, 189,190). These branch in a penniform manner (hence we propose to call them the penniform fibres), and interlace with those on the same plane as Fig. 187. Fig. 186.

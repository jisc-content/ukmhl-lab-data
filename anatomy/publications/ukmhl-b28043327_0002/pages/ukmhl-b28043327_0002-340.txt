The blood was analyzed by our friend, Mr. Lionel Beale, Jun., who obtained the results shown in the following table :— No. OF Bleedings. First. Second. Third. Fourth.

The dog was now allowed to recover, and was well fed for three weeks, and at the end of that time his blood was analyzed; he was, then, starved for four days, being allowed nothing but water, and on each of these four days was bled. The following table gives the result of these analyses : — No. OP Bleedings. First. Second. Third. Fourth. Fifth.

In the latter experiments we notice a diminution of the red par- ticles to an extent even more marked than in the former; and it may also be observed that even after a lapse of three weeks, with good feeding, the red particles had not recovered their original amount. With reference to the estimate of the quantity of fibrine it is right to observe, that, both in these and all other analyses, it is liable to an important source of fallacy, which arises from the im- possibility of forming a separate estimate of the quantity of the colourless corpuscles which adhere to the fibrine, and must neces- sarily increase its ajjparent quantity. The modifications which disease produces in the relative quanti- ties of the blood-constituents, are chiefly referable to an increase (real or apparent) in the quantity of fibrine, or a'diminution of that element, or of the blood-corpuscles; or, lastly, to such an alteration in the quality of the fibrine (its quantity being unaltered) that its coagulating power is materially interfered with.

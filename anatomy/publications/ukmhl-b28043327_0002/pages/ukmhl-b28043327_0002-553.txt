The joints of the common tape-worm multiply in this manner, and after a time, when perfectly developed, become free and separate from the trunk of the worm. Amongst the worms (Annehda) reproduction takes place partly in this manner. In the Nais, three or four young worms, resulting from the division of the parent, may often be seen still connected with its body. As these become developed, they are disconnected from the parent and, in their turn, give rise to others by a similar process. Fig. 253.

Point at which new segments are being formed, after Mtlller. In the above instances, multiplication by division occurs as a natural process; but there are many instances in which the parts resulting from artificial division ultimately become developed into a perfect animal. Thus a planaria, or a polyp, may be divided into many segments and each portion has the power of absorbing to itself nutriment, and of becoming developed into a perfect form. The slightest handling, again, causes some animals to break up in pieces, and each separate part becomes a new being. Multiplication by Gemmation,â€”A bud consists of a mass of cells,

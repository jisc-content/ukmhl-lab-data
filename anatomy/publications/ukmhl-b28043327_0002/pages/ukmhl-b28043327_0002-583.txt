UTERUS. CHAP. XXXVIII.] 555 Uterus.â€”uterus is a firm hard body, of a pear shape, fiat- tened more or less anteriorly and posteriorly. On eaeh side, at the upper part, are situated the two angles into which the Fallopian tubes open. The portion above this point is called the fundus, while the lower constricted part of the organ is spoken of as the cervix or neck, and that part situated between the cervix and fundus is denominated the body. The highest part of the neck is spoken of as the os internum. The cavity of the uterus is of a triangular shape, about an inch and a half in width at its upper part, where the Fallopian tubes open; but in the unimpregnated state, its walls almost touch each other, so as to leave a very slight interval, which is usually occu- pied by mucus. The cavity ter- minates in the os uteri, or os tincee, a transverse opening, bounded an- teriorly and posteriorly by two thick and rounded lips. The uterus undergoes extraordi- nary alterations in fonn and size after the impregnation of the ovum, and becomes very vascular and endowed with a highly con- tractile power. The walls of the unimpregnated uterus are about half an inch in thickness in their thickest part, and consist of pale organic mus- cular fibres, with a certain quan- tity of fibrous and areolar tissue. The muscular fibres have been said to be arranged in three layers, but the limits of these Fig. 266. a Muscular fibre cells, from a gravid uterus, in different stages of development, a.

In consequence of the position of the liver, the right-kidney is placed rather lower down than the left. These organs are surroimded by a varying quantity of fat, and are placed behind the peritoneum. The kid- ney is of a dark reddish brown colour, of a firm consistence, and of a close compact texture. Its general form is that of an ordinary French bean, compressed from before backwards, its convex border being external, and its concave edge, or hilum, where the vessels enter, looking towards the median hne. The weight of the healthy kidney is from 44^ to 5 oz. in the male, and somewhat less in the female. The kidneys are supplied with blood by the renal arteries, two large trunks which come off at right angles from the abdo- minal aorta. The blood is retui’ned by the large renal or emulgent veins which open into the inferior cava. These vessels, with the nerves for the supply of the organ, enter the kidney at its notch or hdum, whence also proceeds the ureter. Of the Kidney in the lower Animals.—The first trace of an organ which can be regarded in the fight of a kidney is met with among the Polypi, but the renal natui’e of this is at least doubtful. In Porpita, one of the Acalephce, KoUiker has described an organ which contains guanin, and which he there- fore looks upon in the fight of a kidney. In the Annelida the existence of a renal apparatus is doubtful; but there is some reason for believing that the so-called respiratory organs are to be regarded in this fight. The existence of

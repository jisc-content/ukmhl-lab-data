490 KIDNEY, [chap. XXXIV. that the elements characteristic of the urinary secretion are selected hy the epithelium lining this part of the tube. The diameter of the tube is less immediately after leaving the tuft, than in the rest of its course further down (Fig. 234). The epithelium in the con- Fig. 234. rowed, c. Magnified about 30 diameters, from a drawing of Dr. Beale’s. voluted portion of the tube presents an excellent example of the spheroidal, or glandular variety. It consists of polyhedral particles rather less than ^ of an inch in diameter, with a distinct nucleus, and containing numerous granules, and occupying as much as one-third or more of the total diameter of the tube. The extreme diameter of the convoluted tube is about of an inch, while the diameter of the central canal is not more than from xVoW inch. Straight Portion of the Tube.—The straight portion of the tubes of which the medullary cones or pyramids are composed form anastomoses, or if traced from the papilla towards the base of the

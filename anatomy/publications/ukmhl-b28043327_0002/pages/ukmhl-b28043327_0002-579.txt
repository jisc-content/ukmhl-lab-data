FEMALE URETHRA. Female Organs of Generation.—The formative organ in the female is the ovary., in which the ova are developed and prepared for fecun- dation. From the ovary, the ova pass into the Fallopian tube or elferent duct, which opens into the uterus, the cavity designed for the reception of the ovum after it has been impregnated, in which the formation of the embryo takes place, and its development into the form of the future being occurs. From the uterus passes the vagina or tube which receives the penis of the male in copulation. With the vagina are connected certain glands and accessory organs. Ovaries.—The ovaries are two in number, of an oval form, and flattened antero-posteriorly; they lie in the cavity of the pelvis, and are enclosed in a fold of the broad ligament of the uterus, with which organ they are connected by a narrow cord or round ligament. Each ovary is invested with a firm capsule of condensed fibrous tissue, which is covered with peritoneum, and is usually attached to the corresponding Fallopian tube by one of the fimbriae of the latter. The ovary is composed of a firm, fibrous, and highly vascular stromaj in which are imbedded, at various intervals, a number of small cavities or vesicles, originally discovered by De Graaf, hence called Graafian vesicles. These contain a serous fluid, with a considerable number of cells, amongst which the ovum lies. In the adult ovary, there are usually from ten to fifty, or more, of these Graafian vesicles, varying in size from a small pin’s head to that of a pea. The largest are situated chiefly towards the peri- pheral part of the organ. In the ovary of the advanced foetus and new-born child. Graafian follicles are abundant, and, even at this early period, the ovum can be seen within them. The fibrous

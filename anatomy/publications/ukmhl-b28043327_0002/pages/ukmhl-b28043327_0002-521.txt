MALPIGHIAN TUFTS. CHAP. XXXIV.] 493 of the tuft m the parrot and in the hoa^ is less than in any other instance recorded; and in these animals, as is well known, the urine is almost solid. It is especially worthy of remark, that the uriniferous tubes do not exhibit a corresponding difference in dimensions.

This view is further strengthened by an examination of the arrange- ment of the vessels in the kid- ney of the boa constrictor, figs. 239, 240.

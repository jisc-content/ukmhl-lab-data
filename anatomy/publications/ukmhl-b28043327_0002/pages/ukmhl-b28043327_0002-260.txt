Their restriction to the upper portion of the intestine, and their mode of arrangement in an expanded form beneath the mucous membrane, establish for them an analogy with the buccal glands, which are similarly disposed beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth, and which bear to the salivary glands the same rela- tion as the duodenal glands do to the pancreas. jgj These glands, restricted as they are to the upper portion of the intestine, give a character to it of a physiological kind, and there- fore more definite than any ex- ternal boundary. Accordingly, while the duodenum may pro- perly give its name to these glands, so the presence and extent of them should denote that portion of intestine which may be called duodenum, and define its limits. The solitary glands are found in all parts of the intestine, but are most numerous in the jeju- num, in the coecum, in the ver- miform appendix, and in the rest of the large intestine. When filled with their secretion they are like small grains, about as large as those of mustard-seed, placed beneath the mucous membrane in the submucous tissue, which can- not in those situations be inflated; they may be readily seen by holding up the intestine against the light. When empty and col- lapsed they are not easily dis- covered, and therefore are fre- quently overlooked. One of these glands is a simple vesicle, or sacculus, of mem- brane, shaped like an India-rubber bottle, with a narrow ex- tremity corresponding to the surface of the mucous membrane.

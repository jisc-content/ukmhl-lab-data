The capillary network of the inner surface is so close that there is no room for pigment-cells in its interstices; but between it and the ar- teries and veins, as well as among the veins themselves, there is a great Fig. 114.

The pigment-cells in the sub- stance of the choroid (fig. 114, b) are extremely irregular in shape, and lie in various direc- tions amongst the other ele- mentary tissues. Similar ones are found in the iris, and sparingly in the anterior part of the sclerotic. They are so loaded with pigment that their nuclei are often obscured by it.

481 CHAP. XXXIII.] QUANTITY AND USES OF BILE. It appears that an exclusively amylaceous, or fatty diet, causes a great diminution in the secretion of bile, while a pure flesh diet induces a very abundant secretion. The presence of bile very much promotes the absorption of fatty matter, although a certain quantity of fat is absorbed even if no bile enters the intestine. The presence of bile causes the absorp- tion of two-and-a-half times more fatty matter than would be absorbed without it. Bile appears to render the mucous membrane more permeable to fatty matter. Bidder and Schmidt consider that the chief object of the bile is “ to prolong the series of changes to which animal matter is sub- mitted within the organism, and thus to render it for a longer time efiicient in the discharge of vital processes.”* * On the Pancreas, consult article “ Pancreas” in the Cyclopsedia of Anatomy and Physiology, by Dr. Hyde Salter.

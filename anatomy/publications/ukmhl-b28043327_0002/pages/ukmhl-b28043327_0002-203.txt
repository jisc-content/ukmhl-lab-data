CHAP, xxiii.] DEVELOPEMENT OF THE TEETH. 175 Fig. 15?. ami lap over, and finally meet and unite, so as to form a lid or oper- culum to the now closed cavity. Thus the epithelium of the lining membrane of the mouth may be shewn to form the lining of the follicle, and to be reflected thence over the surface of the papilla. Now, the tooth papilla must be regarded as homologous with, or answering to, the tactile and hair papillae of the skin, already de- scribed at a former page; and it would, therefore, be expected that, its main part would consist of a peculiar sub-mucous tissue, covered by a homogeneous basement membrane, and surmounted by a tissue answering to the epithelium; and this seems actually the case. The substance of the papilla is at first a congeries of gi’anular nuclei, dis- persed irregularly through a firm homogeneous sub-granular matrix, or blastema, in which vessels and nerves are by degrees developed. This is bounded by a definite transparent membrane, on which rests a reflection of the epithelium lining the sac, modified in structure, so as to present a series of columnar nucleated particles, the matrix of the future enamel. It would appear that the lining and reflected layers of the epithelium become blended toge- ther, and constitute but one, which is more adherent to the sac than to the papilla, so that on opening the sac its wall generally seems to be unattached to the surface of the papilla, and the latter to be limited by what we have regarded as the basement membrane. Or, it may be that the epithelium reflected over the papilla disappears, leaving only that which lines the sac.

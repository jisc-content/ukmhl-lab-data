This disposition of the fibres may he particularly well seen on thin sections made from the dried aorta of the ox, and afterwards moistened with acetic acid. It is also sufficiently obvious in the aorta of the human subject, but the fibres are all very much smaller, nearly one- half the size of those of the ox, and the penniforni subdivision is not so distinct. Musmlar Fibres.—Interposed between the layers of penniform fibres we find some of the wavy white mg. 189.

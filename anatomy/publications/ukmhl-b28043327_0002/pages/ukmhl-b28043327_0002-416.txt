Coats of the Bronchia.—All these become gradually tliinuer as they approach the air-cells. The cartilaginous pieces, Avhich are irregular in shape and position in the lobal bronchia, become reduced to mere flakes, and finally cease in those of one-sixth or one-tenth of an inch in diameter (fig. 204). The last are seen mostly where branchings occur. The muscular fibres of the trachea are continued down even to the terminal bronchia, but instead of filling up only the gap in the cartilaginous framework, they form a uniform layer encircling the canal, but exces- sively thin. The fibres are here arranged in anastomosing bundles (fig. 203). Within the muscular layer is that of the longitudinal elastic fibres, here disposed as an even layer, and re- presenting the submucous areolar tissue.

The bronchial arteries are usually two, coming from the aorta, but irregular. They supply the coats of the bronchia, and have corresponding veins. Their capillaries anastomose with those of the pulmonary artery where the terminal bronchia become lobular passages. The distribution and actions of the pulmonary nerves have been already discussed (pp. 120, 124-7). Ultimate Pulmonary Tissue.—Lobules.—In some parts of the exterior of the lungs, particularly near the borders, and in some animals throughout, may be noticed a sort of mapping out of the pulmonary substance into small polyhedral masses separated by areolar tissue, and having a very irregular shape. These are the lobules of the lungs. They can only be made out in certain situ- ations, even by dissection, for it does not appear that the Avhole human lung is thus subdivided by areolar septa. Nevertheless, it seems certain that each terminal twig of the bronchus is in relation with only its own proper set of air-cells, and that such sets of cells do not communicate except through the medium of the bronchia. In this sense lobules exist everywhere, even Avhen not isolated by areolar tissue, and in this sense we shall use the term, as con-

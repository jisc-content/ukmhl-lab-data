These are, from before backwards, the conjunctival layer of epithelium, the anterior elastic lamina, the cornea proper, the posterior elastic lamina, and the epi- thelium of the aqueous humor, or posterior epithelium. The cor- nea, when uuinflamed, contains no hlood-vessels; those of the surrounding parts running back in loops, as they arrive at its border. On the cornea proper, or lamellated cornea, the thickness and strength of the cornea mainly depend. It is a peculiar modifica- tion of the white fibrous tissue, continuous with that of the sclerotic. At their line of junction (fig. 109), the fibres, which in the sclerotic Fig. 109. Vertical section of the Sclerotic and Cornea, showing the continuity of their tissue between the dotted lines:—a.

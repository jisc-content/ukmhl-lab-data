FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. [ciIAP. XXXVIII. 552 stroma of the ovaxy is exceedingly firm and hard; it consists prin- cipally of a modification of white fibrous tissue, the fibres of which interlace in all directions; but it is highly vascular, especially at the period of puberty. Graafian Follicles.â€”The Graafian follicles or ovi-sacs consist, when fidly developed, of a closed cavity and contents. The walls are composed externally of a firm fibrous membrane, which is con- nected with the fibrous structure of the ovary; internal to which is a softer and more spongy tissue, containing numerous fusiform cells and fibres, more loosely arranged than in the external part of Fig. 2G3.

After the follicle. Internal to this, especially in young follicles, a clear hyaloid basement membrane may be observed, upon the surface of which, lining the entire follicle, is a tolerably thick layer of epi- thelium, the membrana granulosa of authors. The epithelium is much more abundant in that part of the follicle in which the ovum is situated; indeed, it is entirely imbedded in it. According to the observations of Dr. Barry, the ovum is attached to the wahs of the follicle by certain bands, termed by him retinacula. It is, however, not easy to demonstrate satisfactorily this peculiar ar- rangement of the membrana granulosa. The cells of the mem- brana granulosa of the Graafian follicle have a polygonal foim, and immediately around the ovum are collected into a sort of ring.

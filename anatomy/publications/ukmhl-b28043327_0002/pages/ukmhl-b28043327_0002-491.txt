463 CHAP. XXXIII.] LOBULES OF THE LIVER. of the lobules adhere to these veins, and when they are cut across they do not collapse. The hepatic veins occupying these canals, through- out the organ, receive the blood of the portal vein after it has traA'ersed the plexus of capillaries which envelopes the series of biliary-cells. This plexus of capillaries we therefore term portal- hepatic plexus. It is a plexus containing venous blood, from which the bile-cells derive the materials which they secrete. The space which the blood passes over in traversing this plexus, in contiguity to the cells, is measured by the distance between the ramified portal surface and the ramified hepatic venous surface of the liver. The series of bile-cells discharge the bile into the biliary ducts on the portal side of the plexus, i.e., where the blood is entering it, and their most remote parts commence on the hepatic venous side of it, Fig. 217. wizrsiK'ri' a.

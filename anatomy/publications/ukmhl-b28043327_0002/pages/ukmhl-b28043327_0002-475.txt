INGESTA AND EGESTA.—ANATOMY OF SECRETING OR- GANS GENERALLY. OF THE GLAND CELL. — OF THE DUCTS OF GLANDS. The function of secretion is that by which organised bodies separate from some portion of their internal or external surfaces a material which thereby becomes &ee or loose^ and capable of re- moval, and which is likewise commonly known as the secretion from such surfaces. It is not sufficient that this material should he separated simply from the blood ; for, if this ivere so, aU the tissues would be secretions; hut it must also be separated from a tissue of a special kind, hence known as a secreting tissue. The blood, then, furnishes the materials which are to form the secretions; hut cer- tain tissues are required, without which, these materials could not be- come secreted products : and the secreting tissues are anatomically arranged so as to have one surface adapted to set free, in the form of secretions, the materials derived on the opposite surface from the blood. A secretion may be solid or fluid, living or dead, near to, or dis- tant from, the constituents of the tissues in chemical constitution, capable of re-entering the blood, and being further serviceable in the economy, or, requiring to he expelled from the system as useless or hurtful. Thus, a great variety of very dissimilar products are conveniently classed together as secretions, in virtue of their being separated from the body by tissues provided for that purpose. Excretions.—secretions consist mainly of substances re- sulting from the waste of the tissues coincident with their nutrition or renewal, and which are thrown off from the blood through the se- creting surfaces almost as soon as the capillaries receive them from the tissues. Such are the urine, and portions of those matters

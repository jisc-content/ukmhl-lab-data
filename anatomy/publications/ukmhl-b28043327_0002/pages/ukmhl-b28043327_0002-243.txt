We allude to the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm ; the former as muscles of expiration being the habitual antagonists of the latter, which is the great muscle of inspiration. In short, the excitation of the nervous centre, which is sufficient to cause vomiting, gives rise to a forcible act of respiration, in which the act of expiration is so powerfully opposed by the contracted state of the constrictors of the larynx, the diaphragm also remaining in strong contraction, that the main force of the expiratory muscles is directed to compress the stomach against the latter muscle.* * On the subjects of this chapter see the various works on Anatomy, and the principal systems of Physiology previously referred to ; (Euvres de Spallanzani; Tiedemann et Gmelin sur la Digestion ; Hunter’s Animal QEconomy, by Owen ; Eberle, Physiologic der Verdauung, 1834 ; Simon’s Chemistry, by Day ; Dumas, Traite de Chimie, tom. viii.

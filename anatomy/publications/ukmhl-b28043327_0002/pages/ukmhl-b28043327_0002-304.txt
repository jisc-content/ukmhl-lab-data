ABSORPTION. [chap. XXVI. 27G and Panizza, that in birds, as well as in reptiles and fishes, there are communications with the small veins at many points of the pelvis and abdomen. Nevertheless, the evidence for such a com- munication in the lymphatic glands is very unsatisfactory. The more probable explanation of the fact above noticed seems to be, that the brittle texture of the interior of the glands readily gives way before mercury, and that then the minute veins, which are more numerous than the arteries and less resisting, are the first to receive the extravasated metal. Origin of the Lymphatics.â€”We have before spoken of the origin of the lacteals in the villi of the small intestines. The lymphatics in other regions have been usually considered to arise in the substance of the skin and mucous membranes, and on the surface of the viscera by a plexus of somewhat variable character. In the skin and elsewhere the meshes are very close and small, while on the lungs they are much more open and the vessels larger. The surface of the liver and spleen is overrun with Fig. 171. Part of a ramification of a lymphatic of the under part of the tail of a tadpole, a. bimple membrane, forming the wall of the vessel, b. Prolongation or process of tins membrane. c, d. Fatty granules attached to the inner surface of the membrane, and surrounding the nuclei. e. A closed extremity of the vessel, f. Branched cell, just united to a corresponding extremity. g. Branched cell, on the point of coalescing with a capillary lymphatic vessel already iormed. Magnified 400 diameters. After Kdllikcr. a network of lymphatics of remarkable luxuriance. So far as mercurial injection can inform us, these plexuses are the com- mencement of the lymphatic system; but we have been recently made acquainted with a system of lymphatic vessels discovered by Kblliker in the tail of the larvic of batrachlan reptiles, which renders it probable that a still finer series exists in the higher

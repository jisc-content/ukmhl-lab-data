13 CHAP. XVI.] SUBJECTIVE PHENOMENA OF SMELL. prevented, except that gradually effected by admixture through the pharynx and posterior nares. It is through this latter channel that the odorous particles of food, rising from the throat to the nose during expiration, blend the sensation of smell with that of taste so strongly and habitually, that it becomes difficult to discriminate between them. Analogy would lead to the belief that the nervous apparatus of smell, if irritated by an internal cause, would be the seat of olfactory sensations. Such subjective phenomena have been known to exist in certain cases of disease, in which the nerve, or the anterior lobe of the brain, has been afterwards found disorganized. Occasionally, too, odours are perceived without the actual presence of the object usually giving rise to them. These also must be regarded as sub- jective. The quality of the sense, also, seems to vary not a little in dif- ferent persons; some being strongly affected, even to faintness, by a scent which is almost imperceptible to others. The odours of flowers, for example, are very variously appreciated, as every one must have more or less observed. There are corresponding idiosyncrasies in the other senses.

627 CHAP. XLIV.] FOLLICLES OF MAMMARY GLANDS. the cells become larger and much more numerous. They contain a great number of small oil-globules^ which constitute, when set free, the oil-globules of the milk. In colostrum there are nu- merous cells of this kind, filled with oil-globules. These have been termed colostrum corpuscles, and were first described by Donne. The ducts are lined with columnar epithelium. The walls of ducts of mo- derate size are composed of fibrous tissue, in which a great number of elongated, wavy, and nearly parallel fibres of yellow elastic tissue are seen. Fig. 296.

And we aimed at resting our anatomical descriptions, at least as regards the more important points, upon our own investigations, and at repeating former experiments, or devising new ones, whenever questions of sufficient ' interest presented themselves. While we must humbly confess how small have been the advances attributable to our own labours, the immense extension given to the sciences of Anatomy and Physiology during the last fifteen years, may be admitted as some explanation of the delay that has occurred in the publica- tion of our work, a delay that has been a constant source of regret to us, since we began to discover how impossible it would be for us to complete it within the term originally contemplated. That, in spite of repeated procrastination, it should have been so favourably received, both at home and abroad, has been the greatest encouragement to us, and demands our most thankful acknowledgments.

The internal wall of the tympanum (fig. 132) has two orifices of communication with the internal ear; the fenestra ovalis, a, leading to the vestibule, and the fenestra rotunda, h, opening into the cochlea. Both these are closed by membrane which prevents the escape of the fluid contained in these inner chambers, and communi- ciiAP. XVIII.] THE INNER WALL OF THE TYMPANUM. 69 The inner layer is the ciliated epithelial lining of the cavity, Avhich is easily scraped off for examination in the fresh state (see vol. i. p. 62). Fig. 132. cates vibrations to it. The fenestra ovalis is likewise occupied by the base of the stapes, one of the chain of ossicles connecting it Avith the membrana tympani. Between the fenestrae is the promontory/, c, corre.sponding to the first turn of the cochlea, and furrowed by two or three canals for the nerves which form the anastomosis of Jacobson, n. Behind the fenestra ovalis is a conical eminence, the pyramid, d, hol- lowed, and presenting a small orifice at its summit, which is on a level Avith the middle of the vestibular fenestra. The pyramid con- tains the stapedius muscle, the tendon of which emerges at its sum- mit, and runs to the neck of the stapes. This muscle is supplied

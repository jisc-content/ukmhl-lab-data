SPLEEN. 514 CHAP. XXXV, Malpighian Corpuscles.—Upon making a section of a fresh ox’s spleen, a number of small round whitish bodies will be seen. They are sometimes collected in groups of four or six together, and appear to be connected with the smaller arteries, which are in close proximity to them. These small bodies have been named Malpi- ghian corpuscles from their discoverer; they are in close contact with the spleen pulp, except at the points where they are in con- nection with the coats of the artery. The Malpighian corpuscles are very distinct in pigs, sheep, oxen, and guinea pigs. In most other mammalia they are to be demon- strated, although with greater difficulty. In the human subject they are constantly present; but often are not to be distinguished in consequence of rapidly undergoing post mortem change. In birds, these bodies ai’e very numerous, and have been observed, by Miiller, in the chelonia, among reptiles, but they cannot be seen in the naked amphibia. In fishes, they appear to be absent. Fig. 249. This figure shows the connection of a splenic corpuscle with the neighbouring vesseis. accord- ing to Mr. II. Gray. The coiTJUScle is placed at the angle of bifurcation of one of the small arterie.s. its external surface being covered by a close and delicate capillary plexus, whilst its circumference is invested by a mesh of large veins, which radiate in every direction from its margins. The comparative size of the arteries and veins, the capillary plexus of the pulp, and the inode In which these vessels communicate with the veins, are shown in this figure.

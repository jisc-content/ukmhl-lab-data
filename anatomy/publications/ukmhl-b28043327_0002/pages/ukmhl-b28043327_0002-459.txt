The high development of man’s intellect, as compared with that of the lower animals, would he of comparatively little advantage without his peculiar endowment of speech. To this power, an essential subsidiary is that of producing vocal sounds or voice; which, however, he enjoys in common with a large number of the lower classes. The phenomena of voice are produced by a very beautiful and simple mechanical contrivance, the larynx, which is placed at the top of the trachea, to take advantage, as an exciting force, of the air emitted from the lungs during expiration. The air thus expelled creates vibrations in certain tense and elastic membranes {cho7'doB vocales), the boundaries of a chink which is the orifice at once of entrance and of exit for the supply of air to the lungs. These idbrations generate voice. That the larnyx is the organ of voice is proved by the following very obvious facts:—first, the least alteration in the condition of the raucous membrane covering the vocal cords is invariably accompanied by a change in the tone of the voice, e. g. hoarseness; secondly, ulcerative disease eating through one or both of these vocal cords destroys or gi’eatly impairs the voice; thirdly, opening the trachea below the vocal chords, so as to divert the current of air in expiration from the larynx, will destroy voice; and fourthly, section of the inferior laryngeal nerves, by which the influence of the will is brought to bear on its muscles, and so the tension of tlic vocal cords is regulated, destroys the voice; lastly, by experiment on the dead laiynx, sounds may be produced resembling those of

By this move- ment, the crico-thyroid space may be enlarged or diminished ac- cording as the cartilages separate from or approximate each other in front. Fig. 211. A A. Thyroid cartilage, a.

Vertical portion of cuneiform cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages are two p}T.’amidal bodies articulated by their bases with the oval articular surfaces, already de- scribed on the upper margin of the cricoid cartilage. Each presents a concave posterior surface in which is implanted the arytenoid muscle which passes from one cartilage to the other; an inner smooth surface covered by mucous membrane, and an outer surface which gives attachment to the crico-arytenoid muscles. From the anterior angles of the bases of the arytenoid cartilages proceed the vocal chords to be inserted into the angle of the thyroid. The mobility of the articulation of the arytenoids with the cricoid, and their connexion with the vocal ligaments give them great im- portance in the mechanism of the larynx. The cornicula and the cuneiform cartilages are placed beneath the mucous membrane—the former at the apex, the latter ])arallcl to the anterior border of tbc arytenoid cartilages.

[chap. XXX. amMAL TIEAT. 430 \^'^^atever may be the exact order and nature of the ehanges which eiisue^ they may he looked upon as a more active manifestation of the ordinary phenomena of animal heat. This increase of temperature, which is found generally to accom- pany the abstraction of nervous influence, has been accounted for by the supposition that the tissues were more readily acted upon by the oxygen of the air when deprived of the protective agency of the nervous system; hut although this increased action of the oxygen, or more rapid combustion, may perhaps have considerable weight in the production of these phenomena, it must, by no means, he regarded as the sole cause, nor can the chemical theory of animal heat, as it at present stands, be considered as giving an explanation of the whole of the facts observed in connection with this highly interesting hut abstruse subject.* * Upon the subject of Animal Heat, the following works may he consulted:— Dr. Crawford’s “ Experiments and Observations on Animal Heat,” 1788; Dr. J. Davy’s Memoirs in the Philosophical Transactions, 1814; “Eecherches Experimentales sur 1’Inanition,” M.

NATURE OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS. Respiration is that function by which an interchange of gases takes place between the interior of an organized being and the ex- ternal medimn ; and in the animal kingdom oxygen is the gas re- ceived, and carbonic acid the gas given out. Every part of the surface to which the outer medium (whether air or water) has access may be considered to share in respiration, but in all, except some of the lowest animals, special organs are provided in which the interchange can be more readily effected. These organs in all cases consist of a membranous surface, adapted for contact with the surrounding medium and capable of exposing the fluids of the body in an especial manner to the action of the air. The interchange of the gases through this resjnratory membrane is essentially a purely physico-chemical phenomenon, and must be studied as such. The very gTeat variety of structures with which different animals are furnished for this function merely present us with modifications of the elementary conditions, whereby its activity and extent are governed in the several instances. The contact of air with the blood may be influenced (1) by atmospheric concentration or dilu- tion. In water-breathing animals, the air breathed is that held in solution in the water, and is of course in very small quantity. The density or rarity of the air, according to temperature and baro- metric pressure, may perhaps affect the activity of respiration in air-breathers. (2) The extent of the respiratory surface, (3) the thickness of the tissue between the air and the blood, and (4) the more or less complete manner in which the general mass of the blood is brought from the tissues to the respiratory surface,â€” all these exert much influence on the activity of respiration.

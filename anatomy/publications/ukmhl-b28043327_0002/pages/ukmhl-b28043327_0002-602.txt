GENERATION. [chap. XL. 574 Formation of Blastodermic Vesicle, or Germinal Membrane.— About the time that the ovum reaches the uterus^ the segmenta- tion is complete, and in its general appearance it much resembles the ovarian ovum •, but according to Bischoff, upon careful exami- nation, it is found that the apparently granular mass is really aggregated into minute spherical masses, in the centre of each of which is situated a clear vesicle. Soon each of these collections of granules becomes surrounded with an investing membrane, so that cells are formed, the nuclei of which are represented by the clear central vesicle. The more peripheral cells are first formed, and these from mutual pressure assume a pentagonal or hexagonal form ; they become flattened, and united together at their margins, like pavement epithelium. The same process takes place in the interior of the yolk-mass, and as the cells are formed they pass towards the surface, and thus the thickness of the layer first pro- duced becomes increased. A clear fluid only occupies the central part of the yolk. Thus, after the termination of the cleavage process, a membrane composed of cells is formed within the zona pellucida, which BischofF has termed the “ blastodermic vesicle.” Soon after the formation of this membrane, but not until it has increased in thickness by the addition of new cells upon its inner surface, formed from the contained yolk-mass, an opaque roundish spot, consisting of cells and nuclei, makes its appearance at one spot.

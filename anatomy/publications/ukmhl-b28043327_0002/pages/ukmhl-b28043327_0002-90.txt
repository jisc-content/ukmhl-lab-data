[chap. XVII. INNERVATION. 62 striking a mean between the two impressions is, therefore, con- stantly made use of. The above facts abundantly prove the non-existence of absolutely corresponding points on the two retinae, such as were formerly held to exist. But they do not invalidate what has before been advanced respecting the general correspondence of certain tracts of the two retinae, and the absolute non-correspondence of others. Mr. Wheatstone further observes, that if two dissimilar images are represented at once to the corresponding parts of the two retinae, they are not blended, but seen alternately, according to their distinctness and degree of illumination. This is a very sin- gular circumstance, and agrees closely with what takes place when dissimilar colours are viewed in the same way.* * On the subjects treated of in this chapter reference is made to the folloivdng ^ works: Zinn, Descriptio Anatomica Oculi Humani; Haller, Elementa Physiologi®, tom.

X PREFACE. although at the eleventh hour, to fulfil our engagement to our pupils and to the public. To our friend Dr. H.

We desire also to express our thanks to Mr. Vasey for the skill and ability with which he has executed his portion of the task, that of engraving the drawings on wood. W. B. R. B. T.

282 ABSORPTION. [chap. XXVI, latter exhibits under the microscope myriads of true oil-globules of different sizes. A few oil-globules are commonly found in the chyle, but they are probably extraneous. Dr. G. 0. Rees gives the following analysis of the contents of the thoracic duct of a criminal, who had taken two ounces of bread and four ounces of meat on the preceding evening, and two cups of tea and a piece of toast an hour before he was executed, and whose body was examined one hour and a quarter after death. Nearly six drachms were obtained, of a milky hue, with a .slight tinge of buff.* Water ....... 90-48 Albumen, with traces of fibrine . . . 7-08 Aqueous extractive ..... 0-56 Alcoholic extractive, or Osmazome . . 0"52 Alkaline chloride, carbonate, and sulphate, with traces | of alkaline phosphate, and oxide of iron .

Much variety, however, tvill of course exist in specimens, derived from different animals, and at different periods of digestion. The chief di.stinctions between lymph and blood, are—1st. The absence of the red particles in the former, and, 2nd. The smaller proportion of albumen and fibrine. Chyle differs from blood in the same points, and, moreover, in its large proportion of fat, which may rise, according to Nasse, as high as 15 in 1000. Chyle differs from lymph in containing more albumen, and much more fat. Quantity of chyle and lymph.—That the chyle enters the blood very rapidly along the lacteals during digestion is obvious on opening the body of an animal. It is easy to collect from the • Phil.

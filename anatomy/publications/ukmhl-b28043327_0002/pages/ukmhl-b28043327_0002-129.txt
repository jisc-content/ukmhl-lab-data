THE NINTH PAIR. The nerves which we shall consider in this chapter are purely motor in their function; and, on this account, are conveniently classed together. We shall see, however, that from their occa- sional anastomosis with sensitive nerves, they contain sentient fila- ments which serve to inform the mind of the state of the muscles to which their motor filaments are distributed. T/ie third fair of nerves^ or motores oculorum. These nerves are connected with the crura cerebri. Each nerve emerges from the corresponding crus, on the side of the locus perforatus posticus, or pons Tarini. When traced into the substance of the crus, the component fasci- culi of each nerve are seen to diverge from each other, and to sink into the dark vesicular matter constituting tne locus niger. Here, no doubt, the filaments connect themselves with the vesicles of this mass of gray matter. Each nerve proceeds forwards and outwards, and passes through a canal in that portion of the dura mater which forms the outer wall of the cavernous sinus into the orbit through the spheno-orhital foramen, and just as it has reached this foramen it divides into a superior and an inferior branch, the distribution of which is shewn in the following table. A. Superior division. | palpebrse superioris. I2. b. To the superior rectus oculi. fl. b. To the internal reetus. 2. b. To the inferior rectus. B. Inferior division, "j 3. b. To the inferior oblique.- 4. b. To the ophthalmic ganglion, also called the short V root of that ganglion. The anastomoses of the third nerve take place entirely in that stage of its course in which it lies in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. They arc with the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, and with the carotid branch from the inferior cervical ganglion of

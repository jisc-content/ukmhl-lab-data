Of the Pancreas.—This is a large glandj placed across the spine^ behind the stomach, in physiological relation with the duodenum or the first portion of the intestine. It is flattened from before backwards. Its left extremity, or tail, tapers off towards the spleen; its right extremity, or head, is much larger, lying close within the curve of the duodenum, and presenting a recurved extremity following the lower portion of that intestine, and sometimes termed the lesser pancreas. The ordinary weight of the pancreas, accord- ing to Cruveilhier, is from 3 to 2^ ounces, but may rise to 6 ounces. Its colour is gray, inclining to pink. The pancreas, like the salivary glands, is imbedded in areolar tissue, and receives its blood from several neighbouring ■ vessels. Its arteries are derived from the splenic and hepatic branches of the coeliac axis, and from the superior mesenteric. The blood is returned by the corresponding veins into the vena porta. Its nerves come from the solar plexus. In structure, the pancreas appears to resemble the salivary glands. It is subdivided into lobules separated by septa of areolar tissue, which dip inwards from that which forms a common envelope to the whole gland. The lobules are subdivided into smaller parts by similar, but less complete and more delicate inflections of the areolar tissue; and these minute ultimate granulations or acini of the gland, correspond to the terminal extremities of the common duct. The excretory duct is concealed within the substance of the gland, and takes a course from the left to the right extremity, receiving very numerous tributaries on its w^ay, and thus increasing II II 2

Magnified 250 diameters. network extends over a space corresponding to not more than ten or twelve cells, i.e. over from one-thirtieth to one-twentieth of an inch, and if the rate of the blood be taken at an inch and three quarters per minute, according to the estimate of Valentin, drawn from observation of the frogâ€™s foot, the blood would be somewhere about one second and a half in contact with the air at each circuit. But probably in the higher animals its transit is more rapid. We may here refer to some very interesting observations on the arrangement of the capillaries and terminal air passages, lately made by Mr. Rainey. This careful and accurate anatomist was the first to insist on the fact that, in mammalia and birds at least, the capillaries are, as we have above noticed, bare; exposed on their exterior to the air, not covered by any membrane, either mucous or serous, or by any epithelium; and that by this arrange- ment the most perfect aeration of the blood which traverses them is provided for. The air and the blood may be said to be in contact through the delicate capillary wall, a film less than ^

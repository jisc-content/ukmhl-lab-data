[chap. XLIV. 628 LACTATION. Henle describes muscular fibres in these ducts; but Kolliker and most other anatomists have failed to detect them. We have searched for them carefullyj hut with no better success. The blood-vessels are very numerous, and their finer branches ramify around the terminal foUicles of the gland. The absorbents have been injected by Sir Astley Cooper, wlio describes a superficial set beneath the skin, and a deeper set of trunks which penetrate into the substance of the gland, and form a plexus of great beauty in the interior.” In the male, the lacteal glands exist only in a very rudimentary Fig.m. condition ; but their structure is precisely similar to those of the fe- male, as Sir Astley Cooper demon- strated. In a few very rare instances, they have been unusually developed; and instances arc even on record, where milk has been secreted by the lacteal gland of the male; indeed it has been related, by Humboldt, that the infant has been nourished by the male parent after the death of the female. The lacteal glands are developed like other glands connected with the In the fourth or fifth month, according to the observations of Langer and KoUiker, a papillary projection of the mucous layer Fig. 298. of tlic cpidcrmis occurs. This increases in size; and, by the sixth or seventh month, throws off a number of offsets, from which the lobes of the gland are gradually formed. d‘0^0 Milk is white and opaque, from the presence of (3,0 numerous oil-globules.

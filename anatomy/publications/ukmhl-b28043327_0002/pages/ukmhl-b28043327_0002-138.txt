Its anastomoses with the vagus, and with the fifth, make it probable that it contains some sensitive fila- ments, and this is confirmed by experiments which shew that some sensibility is possessed by the nei’ve, and that this is greatest the nearer we appi’oach the tongue. But that it has no influence upon taste or upon the common sensibility of the organ, is proved by the unimpaired state of both those powers, after complete section of the nerve.* * In addition to the principal systematic works on physiology, reference may he made to Valentin, dc Functionibus Nerv.

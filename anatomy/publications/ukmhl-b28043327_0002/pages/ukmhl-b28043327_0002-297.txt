OF MOTION OF THE FLUID WITHIN THE VESSELS. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON THE FUNCTION OF THE ABSORBENTS. The function of absorption is universal in organized bodies, as they all live and grow by absorbing suitable material from without, and making it a part of themselves. All the tissues are more or less porous, and capable of absorbing fluids brought into contact with them. The cuticle of the hands soaked in water become soft and swollen from the imbibition of that fluid, and if a soluble salt be added to the water, this salt may, ere long, be detected in distant parts of the body by its appropriate tests; showing that the foreign substance has penetrated within the cuticle so as to reach vessels capable of diffusing it throughout the frame.* In the same way soluble substances taken into the mouth, and brought into contact with the alimentary mucous membrane, are rapidly absorbed, either immediately, or after having been first changed and adapted for absorption by the processes described in the preceding chapters. In a similar way gases or fluids effused or * Mr. Erichsen took advantage of a case of extroversion of the bladder to expe- riment on the rapidity of absorption under different circumstances, as indicated by the presence in the urine of the absorbed substances. The following are some of his results. Prussiate of potass taken into the stomach, after a fast of eleven hours, may be apparent in the urine in one minute ; but if immediately after a meal, not till thirty-nine minutes. Vegetable infusions required more time for passage through the system. Galls, uva ursi, madder, rhubarb, logwood, &c., passed in from six- teen to thirty-six minutes, according to the time after a meal. Citrates and tartrates of potass and soda rendered the urine alkaline in from thirty-six to forty-eight mi- nutes. When the feet were immersed in a pail of water containing three ounces of acetate of potass in solution, the urine became alkaline in sixty-seven minutes ; but no effect seemed to be produced when a solution of citrate, tartrate, or prussiate ol' potass was employed (sec Med. Gazette, June, 1845).

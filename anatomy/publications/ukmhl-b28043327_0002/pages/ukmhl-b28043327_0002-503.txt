475 LIVER CELLS. CHAP. XXXIII.] The minute anatomy of the liver has lately been subjected to a careful investigation by our friend and former pupil, Dr. Beale; and we believe he has established the existence of this basement membrane by several different methods of preparation. His obser- vations have been made upon injected as well as uninjected prepa- tions. The membrane is so exceedingly delicate, that it can be demonstrated alone by the granular matter which adheres to it. Dr. Beale has succeeded in injecting the tubular network in which the cells lie; and the injection has been seen to pass round the cells, separating them slightly from each other. When the cells are broken down by the action of chemical reagents, the outline of the tube can often be seen distinctly. This delicate basement membrane in most situations appears to be incorporated with the walls of the capillaries, but in some places it is to be demonstrated distinct from them. Not unfrequently cells are met with in the fluid surrounding a section of liver with shreds of membrane attached to them; and in a few rare instances this membrane may be seen in the form of a tube, in which the cell is evidently contained. Injection, however, affords the most satisfactory proof of the existence of this base- ment membrane.

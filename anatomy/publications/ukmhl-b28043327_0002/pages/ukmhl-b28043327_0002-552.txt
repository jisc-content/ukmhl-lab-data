Amongst the lower elasses of organised beings, both in the animal and vegetable kingdom, the multiplication of individuals, or the propagation of the species, is provided for by three different processes, while in the highest forms of animal life the process of generation is restricted to one of these types. The simplest manner in which the multiplication of individuals takes place, consists in the division of the being into two, each of these again dividing into two others, and so on; this is multipli- cation by fission. The second mode of increase consists in the formation of a bud at some part of the body of the parent: this bud is gradually developed, drops off, becomes independent of its parent, and ulti- mately assumes a perfect form, resembling in aU particulars that from which it sprung. The third mode differs materially from the two former, in the fact, that the new organism results from a series of changes occurring in an impregnated ovum, which is produced by the mutual action of the contents of two dissimilar cells, the products of distinct parental organs. The new body differs essentially from either of the two cells which produced it. This is true generation. Fissiparous Multiplication.—In the lowest plants, such as the lichens and fungi, this mode of multiplication very commonly occurs. The cell, or cells, of which the plant consists, divide and sub-divide; and, in this manner, new organisms are produced. The same mode of reproduction is also seen to be very common amongst the Infusoria, and may be watched in the common vorticella.

Magnified 100 diameters* In tlie groove already mentioned there is a series of elongated bodies, not unlike columnar epithelium, in which the nuclei are very faint. These bodies are thick and cubical at one end, and taper much towards the other. They are united in a row; and it is possible they may have some analogy to the club-shaped bodies of Jacobâ€™s membrane. We can assign them no use. Continuous with the thin margin of the osseous zone is the membranous zone. This is a transparent glassy lamina, having some resemblance to the elastic laminae of the cornea, and the capsule of the lens. A narrow belt of it next the osseous zone is smooth, and exhibits no internal structure, while in the rest of its width it is marked by a number of very minute straight lines, radiatinof outwards from the side of the modiolus. These lines are very delicate at their commencement, become more strongly

These plates are the first rudiments of the vertebrse.

The two plates of opposite sides giâ€™adually approximate, and ultimately coa- lesce, including be- tween them a portion of the chorda dorsalis, a temporary structure, which disappears en- tirely without being transformed into any more permanent tex- ture.

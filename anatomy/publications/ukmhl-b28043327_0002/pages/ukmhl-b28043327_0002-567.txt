CHAP. XXXVII.] TESTICLE. are arranged in conical lobes, or parcels, eacb consisting of two or more tubes, wliicliare covered with alayer of condensed areolar tissue, continuous with the corpus Highmori. These divisions are, however, not complete; for the tubes of one parcel communicate with those of the adjoining ones. The highly convoluted seminal tubes com- mence in blind extremities or in loops; and, after dividing fre- quently, and forming anastomoses, they become less tortuous as Fig. 256. 6 a a. Origin In blind extremities and branching of seminal tubules—human subject, b. One of the blind extremities more highly magnified. they approach the mediastinum testis, where two or more unite to form a short straight duct, the vas rectum ; Fig. 251. these vasa recta again unite, so as to form a sort of net-work, the rete testis, which occupies the mediastinum testis or corpus Highmori. From the rete testis pass the vasa effei'entia, which are usually about twelve or sixteen in number, and are much convoluted; and, by being packed together, form part of the epididymis. They open into a single and highly tor- tuous duct, the vas deferens, which is usually about sixteen inches in length, and forms a very hard, round efferent duct, readily distinguished, by the feel, from the other structures which compose the spermatic cord. The vas deferens is lined with a single layer of tesselated epithelium, and there is a layer of very lax areolar tissue beneath the mucous membrane, which would permit of great BcaT".®’ Transverse section of the vas defe- rens—a segment oniy is represented in the drawing—a.

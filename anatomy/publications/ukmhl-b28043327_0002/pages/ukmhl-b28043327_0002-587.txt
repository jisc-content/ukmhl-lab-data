FEMALE URETHRA. 559 CHAP. XXXVIII.J glands; and in the labia majora are some sebaceous glands, open- ing into the hair follieles^ whieh are so numerous in this region. The papillje in this situation are very numerous and highly developed, and are covered with scaly epithelium. The submucous tissue is abundant, loose, and without fat; it contains many fibres of the yellow element. At the labia majora, the mucous membrane becomes continuous with the external skin, to which it gradually approaches in structure. Urethra.—The female urethra is much shorter and wider than that of the male. It is about an inch and a half in length, and terminates in the meatus urinarius, which opens in the vulva between the nymphse. This canal may be enormously dilated without danger, and a very large calculus has often been extracted from the female bladder through it. The mucous membrane, especially near the bladder, contains many follicles.

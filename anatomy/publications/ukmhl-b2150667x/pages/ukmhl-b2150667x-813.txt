797 TJRINAilY BLADDER. Structure of the Bladder. The Bladder possesses four coatsâ€”serous, muscular, sub- mucous, and mucous. The serous or external coat furnishes only a limited investment to the bladder, as has already been described. The muscular coat is formed of fasciculi of non-striped fibres arranged in three layers. The fasciculi of the exter- nal longMinal layer arise from the posterior surface of the body of the two pubic bones, and from the adjacent part of the prostate gland and its capsule; they reach the anterior surface of the bladder, ascend as far as its apex, and then pass downwards on its posterior surface and base, as far as the neck of the bladder and the under surface of the pro- state. This layer has been named the detrusor urincB muscle. The circular layer lies next the external longitu- dinal layer, and consists of fasciculi which, though to some extent placed transversely to the long axis of the bladder, are for the most part arranged obliquely. At the neck of the bladder they increase in numbers and form the sphincter vesicae muscle. Pettigrew has described the external longi- tudinal and circular layers as forming together a series of figure-of-8 spiral loops. The internal longitudinal layer was first described by Ellis, and consists of slender fasciculi arranged longitudinally in relation to the sub-mucous coat. The muscular coat by its contraction expels the urine from the bladder into the urethra. In cases where the urethra is obstructed by stricture, or by enlargement of the prostate, the muscular coat becomes greatly hypertrophied. The sub-mucous coat forms a layer of vascular connnec- tive tissue between the muscular and mucous coats. It is

551 LYMPHATIC GLANDS, described, and the meshes of the reticulum are crowded with lymph corpuscles. Surrounding each of the follicles, and bounded by the trabeculse, is a space traversed by a reticulum of the [retiform connective tissue, the stellate â€”Semi-diagrammatlc view of therstracture of the cortex of a Lymphatic Wand, c, capsule; t, t, trabeculaj; p, lymph passage with retifoim tissue; /, lymph follicle; v a, yas afferens communicating with lymph passages; o, arte- ries and blood capillaries.

This space contains lymph corpuscles, which are easily washed out, and it obviously resembles the lymph spaces or passages which invest the bases of the follicles of a Peyer's patch. It communicates with the vasa afferentia, from which it can be injected. Owing to the continuity between the tissue of adjacent follicles, their surrounding lymph spaces are also continuous with each other, and form an anastomosing set of lymph passages within the cortex of the gland. The medullary part of the lymphatic 'gland is also

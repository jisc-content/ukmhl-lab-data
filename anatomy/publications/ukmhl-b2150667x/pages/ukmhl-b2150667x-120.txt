ANATOMY. 104 ends of the tones possess investing ligaments lined by synovial membrane, and a strong interosseous ligament binds together the lower ends of the tibia and fibula. An interosseous membrane fills up the interval between their shafts. The movement between the two bones is almost inappreciable. The Ankle Joint is formed by the convex upper and the lateral surfaces of the astragalus fitting into the concavity formed by the lower end of the tibia and the two malleoli. An investing ligament, Hned by synovial membrane, encloses the joint; the lateral portions of this Hgament form distinct bands, and are much stronger than the anterior and posterior fibres. A diarthrodial joint also exists between the astragalus and os calcis, between which bones a powerful interosseous ligament passes. Between the astragalus and scaphoid, and the os calcis and cuboid, important diarthrodial joints are found, which are enclosed by ligamentous bands. The astragalo-scaphoid joint is completed below by the strong inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, on which the head of the astragalus rests. The remaining tarsal bones are connected together usually by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments, and a similar mode of union is found between the distal row of tarsal bones and the metatarsals, except between the great toe and ento-cuneiform, where there is no interosseous ligament. The four outer metatarsals are also connected at their proximal ends by distal, plantar, and interosseous liga- ments; and further, a transverse metatarsal ligament passes between the distal ends of all the metatarsal bones. The metatarsal bones articulate with the pha- langes, and the phalanges with each other, in a simHar

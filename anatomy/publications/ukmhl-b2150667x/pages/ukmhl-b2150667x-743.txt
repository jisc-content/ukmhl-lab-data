727 LIVER. the left. It is attached by areolar tissue to the diaphragm, and a fold of peritoneum called the coronary ligament, pas.ses from it to the under surface of that muscle. The coronary ligament expands at its extremities into the right and left lateral ligaments, and becomes continuous with the posterior border of the falciform ligament opposite a slight depression which marks the separation of the right from the left lobe of the liver. The posterior border is notched for the lodgment of the inferior vena cava. The anterior harder of the liver is unattached, thin, and attenuated, and is marked by a deep notch, opposite the anterior edge of the falciform ligament, which lodges the ro^lnd ligament of the liver. This notch marks the separation of the right from the left lobe. To the right of this round ligament is a shallow notch in the anterior border, at which the fundus of the gall bladder may be usually seen to project; at this spot the liver overlaps the ascending part of the duodenum. Of the two extremities of the liver the right is thick and massive, and lies deep in the right hypochondrium, in con- tact with the diaphragm; the left is thin and attenuated, and overlaps the oesophageal opening and fundus of the stomach. The inferior or visceral surface of the liver is much more complex in form than the upper. The longitudinal or umbilical fissure, continuous with the notch in the anterior border of the liver, and much nearer to the left than the right extremity of the gland, divides it into a large right and a small left lobe. In the anterior part of the fissure the round ligament formed by the ob- literation of the umbilical vein of the foetus is lodged;

329 THE EYEBALL. larger segment of the eyeball, and of an' anterior, translu- cent part, the cornea, which corresponds in its area with the anterior smaller segment of the eyeball. Piercing the sclerotic coat is the optic nerve, which enters the globe about -^th inch to the nasal or inner side of its antero- posterior axis. The second or middle coat, or tunica vasculosa, consists of a posterior part or choroid, the area of which corresponds almost exactly with the sclerotic; this coat possesses anteriorly numerous folds, the ciliary pr-ocesses, which are continuous with the iris, a structure which lies behind the cornea. The third or internal or nervous coat is named the retina, and in it the optic nerve terminates. The enclosed refracting media occupy the axis of the globe, and are named from before backwards the aqueous humour, crystalline lens, and vitreous body. THE EXTERNAL OR FIBROUS TUNIC. The Sclerotic coat, called from its white appearance the white of the eye, is a firm, unyielding fibrous membrane, which forms the posterior |ths of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is thicker behind than in front, and where pierced by the optic nerve it has a cribriform structure, as the bundles of nerve fibres do not pass through one large, but several smaU openings. The sclerotic consists of the white fibrous form of connective tissue, intermingled with a smaU proportion of elastic fibres. The bundles of white fibres lie in two directions; some pass in the meridian of the globe from the optic nerve towards the cornea, others lie paraUel to its equator. The sclerotic is joined by accessory fibres behind, derived from the perineurium of

MUSCULAR TISSUE. 185 and Kp, and other muscles of the face, these fibres usually branch prior to their insertion, and the branches taper off to finely attenuated ends. In the heart also the fibres branch; and the branches of adjacent fibres anastomose, so that the muscular wall of this organ consists of a compact network of fibres; the individual fibres are smaller than those of the volun- tary muscles, the transverse striation is much less distinct, and it is doubtful if an investing sarcolemma be present. Some difficulty has been experienced in determining the exact mode of connection of the fibres of the belly of a muscle with those of its terminal tendons. By some it has been supposed that the fibres of the muscle are directly continued into the con- nective tissue bundles of the tendon; whilst ^ti tKn* Weismann has described the muscular fibre ^u'clr Ire o1 as terminating in a sharply-defined, rounded, Jh^bnnm'oJ^ie or pointed extremity, to which the fibres of rmf ^''''""^ the tendons are closely apposed. Both the striped and non-striped forms of muscle are weU provided with blood-vessels, which ramify in the sub- stance of the muscle lying in the areolar connective tissue, or perimysium, that separates the fasciculi and fibres from each other. The capillaries form an elongated network, the principal strands of which lie parallel to the muscular fibres, but never penetrate the sarcolemma. Hence, though the beUy of a muscle is a highly vascular organ, its individual fibres are extra-vascular. But if Thin's observations be

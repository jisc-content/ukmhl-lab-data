223 SPINAL COED. Spinal Coed. The Medulla Spinalis, or Spinal Coed, occupies the spinal caual, and extends from the foramen magnum to opposite the body of the first lumbar vertebra. In thei early foetus it equals in length the canal itself; but as the spinal column grows at a greater proportional rate than the cord, the latter, when growth has ceased, is several inches shorter than the column. The cord is continuous above with the medulla oblongata, whilst it tapers off below into a slender thread, the filum terminale, which lies in the axis of the sacral canal, and is attached below to the back of the coccyx, or to the fibrous mem- brane which closes in below the sacral canal. The length of the cord is from 16 to 18 inches. It approaches a cylinder in shape, but is flattened on its anterior and pos- terior surfaces, and presents two enlargements which have a greater girth than the rest of the cord. The upper, called the cervical or brachial enlargement, extends from opposite the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and from it arise the nerves which supply the upper limbs; the lower, caUed the crural or lumbar enlargement, is opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and supplies with nerves the lower limbs. The cord is almost completely divided into right and left lateral halves by two fissures, named respectively anterior and posterior median fissures, which do not quite reach the centre of the cord, for at the bottom of the anterior fissure are the transverse fibres of the anterior â€¢white commissure, and at the bottom of the posterior fissure the fibres of the posterior grey commissure. By these com-

609 .THOEAX; downwards and backwards, like those of the internal intercostals, and correspond in length to two intercostal spaces. The thorax is usually compared in shape to a trun- cated cone, the apex of which is above, the base below. It is rounded at the sides, but flattened both in front and behind. The truncated apex, or thoracic inlet, is bounded behind by the first dorsal vertebra, laterally by the first pair of ribs, and in front by the manubrium or pre-sternum. As the vertical diameter of the sternum is less than that of the series of dorsal vertebrae, the upper end of the sternum does not reach so high as the first dorsal vertebra, and the plane of the thoracic inlet slopes obliquely from above downwards and forwards. In expiration the upper border of the manubrium is opposite the body of the third dorsal vertebra, or the disc between it and the second dorsal vertebra; in inspiration it is raised to opposite the body Of the second vertebra. Through the thoracic inlet the trachea, oesophagus, and some large veins, and nerves descend into the thorax, and the great arteries and thoracic duct ascend into the neck. Owing to the obliquity of the plane of the thoracic inlet, th^ parts in the middle of the lower part of the neck, though above the sternum, lie anterior to the bodies of the first and second dorsal vertebrae. The base of the thorax is much more capacious than the apex. It slopes from the xiphi-sternum downwards, outwards, and backwards along the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, as far as the cartilaginous tip of the eleventh rib, and then slopes upwards, backwards, and inwards along the twelfth rib to the twelfth dorsal verte-

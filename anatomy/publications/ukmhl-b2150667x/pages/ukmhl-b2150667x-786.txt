770 ANATOMY. temporary teeth. The primitive groove, occupied by an involution of the epithelial covering of the gum, is pro longed backwards. Three dental papillEe successively appear at the bottom of this groove, and the epithelium covering each papilla forms its enamel organ. Legros and Magitot, however, state that the 2nd permanent molar arises in connection with a diverticulum (cavity of reserve) proceeding from the epithelial string of the enamel organ of the 1st permanent molar, and that the wisdom tooth is formed in connection with a similar diverticulum from the 2nd permanent molar. The embryo tooth becomes saccu- lated, and goes through the process of calcification similar to what has been described in the other teeth. The germ of the 1st permanent molar appears about the sixteenth week of embryo-life : that of the 2nd permanent molar not until about the seventh month after birth, whilst that of the wisdom tooth is not formed until about the sixth year. The crown of the first molar is the first of the permanent teeth to erupt into the mouth, which it usually does in the sixth year. The incisors appear when the child is 7 or 8; the bicuspids when it is 9 or 10; the canines about 12; the second molars about 13 j and the wisdom teeth from 17 to 25. In his dentition man is diphyodont as regards his incisors, canine, and premolar teeth; but monophyodont in the molar series. From the description of the development of the teeth, it will have been seen that a tooth is an organ composed of three hard tissues, enamel, dentine and cement, and of the soft vascular and nervous pulp. These tissues are not developed from one layer only of the blastoderm. The

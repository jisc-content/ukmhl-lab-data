INTERNAL STRUCTUKE OF THE CEREBRUM. 281 understood, but both it and the pituitary body, which possess a certain structural correspondence, are usually referred to the type of the ductless glands. The corpora quadrigemina or optic lobes are situated behind and between the two optic thalami, and rest upon the posterior surface of the crura cerebri. The division into two lateral halves is marked by a shallow longitu- dinal fissure, and the subdivision of each haK into an an- terior and a posterior eminence, by a shallow transverse fissure. The anterior pair of eminences are called nates; the posterior, testes. From each testis a strong white band, the superior peckmcle of the cerebelhim, passes back- wards to the cerebellum, and stretching between the pair of peduncles is the valve of Vieussens or anterior medullary velum. The corpora quadrigemina are tunnelled in the antero-posterior direction by the aqueduct of Sylvius, which opens anteriorly into the third ventricle immediately below the posterior commissure, and posteriorly into the fourth ventricle under cover of the valve of Vieussens; it is lined by a cylindrical ciliated epithelium. Internal Structuke of the Cerebrum. The cerebrum is composed both of grey and white matter; the general relations of these two forms of nerve matter to each other may be seen by making sections through the cerebrum. The determination, however, of their minute structure, and of the relations and connections of the nerve fibres to the nerve cells is, owing to the deli- cacy of the organ, one of the most difficult departments of anatomical study. Several anatomists have endeavoured

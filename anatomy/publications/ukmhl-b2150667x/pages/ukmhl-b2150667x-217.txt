In the grey matter on the surface of the cerebellum the body of the cell is almost globular; from that aspect of the cell which is directed towards the white matter a slender central process arises; from the opposite or peripheral aspect of the cell two strong, antler- like branching processes extend for a considerable distance (Fig. 82). In the human sjrmpathetic gan- glia, again, the stellate form of ceU prevails, and the existence of a cap- sule of connective tissue around the individual cells can be recognised (Fig. 67).

These branching processes apparently consist exclusively of cell protoplasm, and have been called protoplasm processes. Gerlach has described the proto- plasm processes of the multipolar nerve ceUs of the brain and spinal cord as forming an excessively minute network, from which minute medullated nerve fibres arise; and F. BoU conceives that a similar arrangement occurs in the ceUs of the cerebellum. One, at least, of the processes of a multipolar nerve cell does not branch, but becomes directly

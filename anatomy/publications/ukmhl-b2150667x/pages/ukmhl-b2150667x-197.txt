181 MUSCULAR TISSUE. If a fibre be carefully separated from a fasciculus, and examined microscopically by transmitted light, transverse stripes may be readily seen to extend across it from side to side. These transverse striae are not mere surface marks, but, as Bowman pointed out, pass through its entire thickness, and lie parallel to each other. The stria- tion is due to the structure of the fibre, which consists, as was shown by Dobie in 1848, of two kinds of sarcous matter, of dark and light bands or discs, alternately dark and Light. The discs differ, according to Briicke, in optical properties, the light discs refracting the light singlyâ€”are isotropic; whilst the dark discs refract light doubly, and consist of an anisotropic substance. Dobie described in 1848 a dark line passing across the light disc, so as to subdivide it into two halves, which line Busk and Huxley showed to be dotted; and this appearance has also been figured by Sharpey, Krause, and others. It is believed to be due to the presence of a strongly refracting stripe in the middle of the feebly refracting Ughtdisc. Dobie, and more recently Hensen, have directed attention to a slender, feebly refracting stripe passing transversely across the strongly refracting dark disc, so as to subdivide it also into two halves. In addition to the transverse strife, the fibres not unfrequently show markings which extend'''^ersei^'^BSed longitudinaUy, but these are irregular in ^""'^ position, do not correspond to the whole length of the fibre, or necessarily pass through its entire thickness. The transverse and longitudinal markings indicate that

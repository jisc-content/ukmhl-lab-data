ANATOMY. 684 cavity, as the sac of the omentum, between the ascending and the descending layers of the great omentum, is seen most readily in young persons ; for in adults it is not un- common to find these layers fused together, or even riddled with numerous holes. The parietal layer of the peritoneum is supplied with blood by the extra-peritoneal arterial plexus already de- scribed (p. 433). The visceral layer is supplied by branches of the arteries, which pass to the viscera that it invests. Lymphatic vessels form networks in the sub- endothelial layer of connective tissue, and communicate through microscopic stomata with the peritoneal cavity. Nerves pass to the diaphragmatic peritoneum from the phrenic nerve, to the parietal peritoneum of the lumbar regions from the lower intercostals, and to the pelvic peri- toneum from some of the sacral nerves. Twigs from the sympathetic plexus apparently pass to the visceral peri- toneum.

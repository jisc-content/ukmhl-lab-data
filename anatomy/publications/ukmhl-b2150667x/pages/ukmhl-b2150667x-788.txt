ANATOMY. 772 may be absent in the teeth of some animals. For ex- ample, the tusks of the elephant and narwhal, and the teeth of the Edentata, are without enamel, and, in the Eodentia, enamel is present on only the anterior sur- face of the incisors. But though the enamel is not developed, or forms only m. imperfect covering for the crowns of these teeth, yet an enamel organ is formed in the embryo jaws. In 1872 I described a structure homologous with the enamel organ in relation with each of the dental papillae in the lower jaw of a foetal narwhal; but this organ did not exhibit a differentiation into the three epithelial layers, such as occurs in those teeth in which enamel is developed. Since then C. Tomes has seen an enamel organ in the embryo armadillo, and has also pointed out that, in teeth generally, enamel organs exist, quite irrespective of whether enamel' subsequently does or does not form. But further, the involution of the oral epithelium^ and the coincident formation of a primitive groove, take place not only where the teeth subsequently arise, but along the whole curvature of the future jaws; whilst the production of dental papillae is restricted to the spots where the teeth are formed. Hence I am disposed to consider the inflection of the- oral epithelium as not so essential to the development of a tooth, as the formation of a papilla. The inflected epithelium marks only a pre- liminary stage, and it may or may not be transformed into tooth structure. But that which is essential to the forma- tion of a tooth is the production of the papilla which appears at the bottom of the primitive groove.

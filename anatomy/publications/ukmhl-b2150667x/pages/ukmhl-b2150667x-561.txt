In many parts of the body round, colourless cells, resem- bling the corpuscles of lymph, or the white corpuscles of the blood, are either infiltrated into the meshes of the con- nective tissue, ^ or are collected into masses visible to the naked eye. These may appropriately be called Lymphoid Organs. Not unfrequently these organs are situated as node-like swellings in the course of the lymphatic vessels, and are invested by definite capsules, when they are known as Lymphatic Glands. At other times they are not separated from the surrounding connective tissue by a definite capsule, and apparently are not situated in the direct course of lymphatic vessels, though a network of lymph- capillaries may lie around them, when they are termed Lymph Follicles.

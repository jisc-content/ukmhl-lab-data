6 ANATOMY. where the atlas or first vertebra is situated is atlantal, that directed towards the sacmm is sacral, that towards the back is dorsal, that towards the front is ventral or haemal. Quite recently the term prce-axial has been introduced as equivalent to atlantal, and post-axial to sacral. The body may be considered as divided by an imaginary plane, the mesial plane, into two lateral and similar halves, a right and left, so that it exhibits a bilateral symmetry j and the constituent parts are described as being external or internal to each other, according to their relative position to this plane. For descriptive purposes, also, we may subdivide the body into Axial and Appendictjlae portions. The Axial part is the stock or stem of the body, and consists of the Head, the Neck, and the Trunk. The trunk is again subdivided into the chest or Thorax, and the belly or Abdomen; and the abdomen is agaiu sub- divided into the abdomen proper and the Pelvis. The axial part contains the organs essential to the preservation of life. In the head is lodged the brain, from which the spinal marrow is prolonged down the spinal canal. At the sides of the head are the ears, and opening on to the face are the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. Prolonged down the neck are the gullet and windpipe, with the latter of which is associated the organ .of voice. Within the chest lie the heart, lungs, and gullet; and in the abdomen are contained the stomach, intestine, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and other organs concerned in the urinary and generative functions. The Appendicular part forms the Mmbs, which do not contain organs essential to life. In man the limbs are called Upper and Lower—the former are instruments of prehension, the latter of progression. The subdivisions

476 ANATOMY. As the artery lies in the femoral sheath, it gives origin to three superficial branches, which pierce the fascia lata, and end in the skin, superficial fascia, and lymphatic glands of the groin. a. Superficial Circumflex Iliac, which runs outwards to the anterior superior iliac spine. 6. Superfijcial Epigastric, which ascends in front of Pou- part's ligament to the wall of the abdomen. c. Superficial Pudic usually consists of two branchesâ€”a superior and an inferior, which run inwards and end in the skin of the external organs of generation. d. Mtiscular branches small in size, which run outwards into the muscles of the thigh, e. Anastomotic arises near the lower end of Hunter's canal; it divides into three branches : a cutaneous, which runs along with the long saphenous nerve behind the sartorius to the inner side of the knee ; a muscular, which passes into the substance of the vastus internus, and is distributed as low down as the knee : an aHicidar, which descends directly to the knee on the tendon of the ad- ductor magnus inserted into the internal femoral condyle. The largest and most important branch of the femoral is /. The Profunda, or Deep Femoral artery, which arises in Scarpa's triangle from the posterior and outer part of the femoral from one and a half to two inches below Poupart's ligament. It descends behind the femoral artery and the tendon of the adductor longus, and pierces the substance of the adductor magnus muscle. It has the iliacus, pectineus, adductor brevis and adductor magnus muscles behind it, and the femoral and profunda veins lie between it and the femoral artery. From it arise the following

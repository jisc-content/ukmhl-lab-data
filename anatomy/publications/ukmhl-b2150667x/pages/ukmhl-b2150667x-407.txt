391 THE SKIN. within the follicle are pushed outwards towards its wall and form the cells of the root-sheath. When a hair is pulled out of its follicle the cells of the root-sheath are drawn out along with it. A new hair wiU be developed at the bottom of a follicle from which the hair has been shed as long as cells continue to be formed around the papilla. When the growth of cells ceases within the hair follicles then permanent baldness is the result. The sebaceous glands are developed as bud-like offshoots from the hair follicles, filled, like the follicles themselves, with cells continuous with the epiblast cells of the rete Malpighii. Instead -of the cells in these buds differentiat- ing into a hair, they become filled with fatty particles, and the wan of the bud assumes the characteristic sacculated form of the gland. Sweat Glands, or sudoriparous glands, are found generally distributed throughout the skin, but are most abundant in tJie palms and soles, where they number 2500 to 3000 in each square inch. In the skin of the back, again, there are only between 400 and 500 in the square inch. Each gland consists of a ball-like body lying in the subcutaneous tissue, from which a tubular duct proceeds through the skin to open on its free surface. The baU is composed of a convoluted tube continuous with the tubular duct, and terminating in a bHnd end. The wall of the gland tube consists of a deKcate nucleated membrane Hned by columnar secreting cells. It is surrounded by connective tissue containing capillary blood-vessels. As the gland-duct pierces the cutis it passes between the papilla; in its course through the cuticle it pursues a spiral direction, and has its walls formed, not of a distinct membrane, but of the cutide

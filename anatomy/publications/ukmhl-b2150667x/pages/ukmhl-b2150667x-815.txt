URINA.KY BLADDER. 799 contact with the deep surface of the cells of the superficial stratum, whilst the narrow end is prolonged between the cells of the deepest stratum, which are irregularly oval or rounded cells, with sometimes a slender process prolonged between the narrow ends of the pear-shaped cells. Small racemose glands open on the surface of the mucous mem- brane, especially in the region of the cervix; their excre- tory ducts are lined by columnar epithelium. The arteries which supply the bladder with blood are the superior vesical branch of the hypogastric artery, and the inferior vesical branch of the internal iliac, which are distributed in the muscular coat, and give rise to a capil- lary network in the mucous membrane. The veins pass to the vesical venous plexus. Lymphatics occur in the walls of the bladder, especially in the trigone, in which region solitary lymph follicles are also found ; the lymph vessels join the lymphatics which accompany the internal iliac artery. The nerves proceed" from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic and from the sacro-coccygeal plexuses, r. Darwin has traced slender plexuses with nerve cells accompanying the blood-vessels.

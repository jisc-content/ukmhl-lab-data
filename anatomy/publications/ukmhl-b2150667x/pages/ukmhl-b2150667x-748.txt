732 ANATOMY.^ scribed by a definite capsule of connective tissue, and tlie capsules of adjacent lobules blend with each other. In the camel the observations of Goodsir showed that the capsules of connective tissue were thicker and more distinct than in the *pig. In the polar bear, Johannes Miiller has described the lobules as distinct and easily separable from each other; and Hyrtl has observed a similar appearance in the liver of the South American rodent, Octodon Cumingii. The capsule of connective tissue is continuous with Glisson's capsule, which invests the interlobular vessels, and, in the case of the lobules lying next the surface of the liver.

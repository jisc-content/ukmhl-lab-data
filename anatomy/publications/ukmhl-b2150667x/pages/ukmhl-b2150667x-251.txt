SPINAL NERVES. 235 than are tlie parts wliicli receive branclies from a single nerve only. These plexuses are especially found in con- nection with the nerves which supply the extremities, where, owing to the complexity of the muscular move- ments, the co-ordination of these movements through the nervous system is rendered necessary. The anterior divisions of the eight cervical nerves are arranged in two plexuses, named cervical and brachial. The Cervical plexus is formed of the four upper cervical nerves, which make, by interlacement with each other, a series of loops in front of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (Fig. 76). Arising either directly from these nerves, or from the plexus which they form, are com- municating, muscular, and cutaneous branches. The Com- municating branches connect these nerves with the large superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic system, also with the vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal cranial nerves, and with the descending branch of the hypoglossal, these last being especially called communicantes noni. The Mus- cular branches supply the anterior recti muscles of the neck, the levator scapulae, the posterior scalenus, the diaphragm, and in part the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The branch to the diaphragm, or the phrenic nerve, is the most impor- tant ; it springs from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical, and passes down the lower part of the neck, and through the thorax, to supply its own half of the diaphragm; Luschka has described twigs proceeding from the phrenic to the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum. The Cutaneous branches are as follows:â€”^the occipitalis minor, a branch of the 2d cervical goes to the skin of the occiput; the auriculo^arotidean, a branch of the 2d and 3d cervical,

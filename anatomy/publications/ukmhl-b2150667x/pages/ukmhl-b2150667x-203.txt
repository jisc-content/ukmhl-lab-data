187 MUSCULAE TISSUE, by Scliwann. The process, briefly stated, is as follows : The embryonic cells elongate, the nucleus may remain single, but more usually it divides and subdivides, so that many nuclei appear in the interior of the_ elongated cell. The nuclei lie in linear series, and may either be separated from each other, or two or more may be in contact, and they may lie either near the periphery of the elongated cell, or in its axis. With this multiplication of the nuclei, the cell increases in length and assumes the form of a fibre. The ceU protoplasm, both in the single and many-nucleated fibres, then differentiates into the sarcous particles of the transverse stvias, and as this progresses the fibre assumes its characteristic striped appearance. The whole amount of the protoplasm does not, however, assume the transversely striped appearance, for a small quantity remains around each nucleus and forms with it a muscle coipuscle. The differentiation of the protoplasm occasions an anatomical and chemico-physical change in the fibre, and confers on it the property of energetic contractility. W. Engelmann has endeavoured to show that the opaque anisotropic discs of the fibre are those in which the power of contractility resides, and that the clear isotropic discs possess only elastic properties. The mode of development of the sarcolemma is stiU somewhat obscure. By some it is regarded as the wall of the embryonic cells, which have become metamorphosed into muscular fibres; by others it is regarded as a special differentiation of the protoplasm at the periphery of the fibre taking place at the time when the transverse strisB are being formed; whilst by others it is considered to be a special modification of connective tissue formed around the fibre. In the development of the muscular fibres of

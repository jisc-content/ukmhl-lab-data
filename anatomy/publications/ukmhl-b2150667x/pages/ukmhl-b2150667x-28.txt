12 ANATOMY. entire column the spiny character from which has arisen the term Spine, applied to it. The transverse processes project outwards, one from each side of the arch. The articular processes project, two upwards and two downwards, and are for connecting adjacent vertebrae together. The Notches, situated on the upper and lower borders of the pedicles, form in the articulated spine the intervertebral foramina through which the nerves pass out of the spinal canal. The vertebrae in each group have characters which specially distinguish them. In man and all mammals, with few exceptions, whatever be the length of the neck, the Cervical Vertebrae are seven in number. The excep- tions are the three-toed sloth, which has nine, and Hoff- mann's sloth and the manatee, in which there are only six. In many whales the seven cervicals are fused in the adult into a single bone. In man the body of a cervical vertebra is comparatively small, and its upper surface is transversely concave; the arch has long and obliquely sloping laminee; the ring is large and triangular; the spine is short, bifid, and horizontal; the transverse process consists of two bars of bone, the anterior springing from the side of the body, the posterior from the arch, and uniting externally to enclose a foramen, through which, as a rule, the vertebral artery passes; the articular processes are flat and obUque, and the upper pair of notches are deeper than the lower. The first, second, and seventh cervical vertebrae have characters:which specially distinguish them. The first, or Atlas, has no body or spine : its ring is very large, and on each side of the ring is a thick mass of bone, the lateral mass, by which it articulates with the occipital bone above

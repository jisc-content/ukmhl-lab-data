190 ANATOMY. a nerve connects a nerve centre with, a peripheral end- organ, and conducts impulses from the centre to the end-organ, it is a centro-'peri'plieral or centrifugal nerve. When a nerve connects a peripheral end-organ with a centre, and conducts impulses from the end-organ to the centre, it is a perijjli&ro-central or centripetal nerve. Owing to the different directions in which impulses are con- ducted by nerves, the varying nature of their end-organs, and the structural and functional differentiation of the nerve centres, or portions of the nerve centres in which their central extremities terminate, nerves vary so in their functions, that a classification of the nerves, based upon their functional properties, has been proposed. Of the centro-peripheral nerves, those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscles are motor nerves; those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscular coat of the blood-vessels are vaso-motor nerves ; those which terminate in connection with, and conduct impulses to the secreting cells of a gland, are secretory nerves; whilst some physio- logists have named nerves which they believe to terminate in the tissues and to conduct impidses for the regulation of their nutrition, trophic nerves. It should be stated, how- ever, that it is not yet absolutely determined that the cell elements of the tissues have special nerves terminating in connection with them for the purpose of exercising a direct influence over their nutrition. Should these special nerves be non-existent, then the nutritive functions would be influenced solely by the vaso-motor nerves, wHch regulate the size of the blood-vessels and the amount of blood which flows through a part in a given time. Certain nerves which conduct impulses, by virtue of which the I

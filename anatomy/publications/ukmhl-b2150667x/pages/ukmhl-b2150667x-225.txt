NERVOUS TISSUE. 209 spun out, one, according to Hensen, may form a cell in a nerve centre, the other may differentiate into a peripheral end-organ. In the tail of the tadpole the formation and growth of nerve fibres have been studied by Kolliker, and it has been seen that the terminal part of a fibre may have fusiform or tri-radiate cells connected with it, the processes of vrhich cells gradually differentiate into nerve fibres. Others again maintain that elongation of the embryonic cells, destined to become nerve fibres, takes place, that these elongated cells join end to end, and that in this manner the fibres are built up. The young cerebro- spinal nerve fibres are distinctly nucleated, and correspond in appearance and structural characters to the non- medullated nerve fibres of the adult. If iu a young or adult person a nerve be cut across, its conducting power is destroyed; but after a time it reunites, and its function is restored. The part of the nerve which lies between the place of section and its peripheral extremity, undergoes, as Waller pointed out, degenerative changes. To how great an extent the de- generation affects the various constituents of each fibre, it is difficult to determine; for whilst some experiments would seem to show that only the medullaiy sheath broke up into granular particles and was absorbed, in others both It and the axial cylinder disappeared. In process of time, however, these parts may be reproduced, and the nerve then recovers its functional activity. 0

222 ANATOMY. which pass from the pia mater into the brain and spinal cord are invested by a loose funnel-shaped sheath, which has been described as forming the wall of a peri-vascular lymphatic vessel; but Key and Eetzius consider that the space between the blood-vessel and the sheath opens into the sub-arachnoid space, and contains cerebro-spinal fluid. They believe that they have proved that the sub- arachnoid cerebro-spinal spaces are in free communication with the serous and lymphatic spaces of the organs of sense, and that through the entire peripheral nervous system, even to its furthest ramifications, a serous system exists, which along the nerve roots is in free communica- tion with the central sub-arachnoid spaces. They also describe the ventricles of the brain as in communication with the sub-arachnoid spaces. A network of lymph vessels ramifies freely in the pia mater. It is also well provided with nerves, which arise from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, from some of the cranial nerves, and from the carotid and vertebral plexuses of the sympathetic. The epi-cerebral and epi-spinal spaces described by His as existing between the pia mater and the brain and spinal cord are in all probability artificial productions. In the spinal canal a slender fibrous band projects from the pia mater covering the side of the cord, and, pushing the arachnoid membrane ia front of it, is attached by about twenty-two pairs of denticulated processes to the inner surface of the dura mater. It is named Ugamentum denticulatum, and its teeth alternate with the successive pairs of spinal nerves.

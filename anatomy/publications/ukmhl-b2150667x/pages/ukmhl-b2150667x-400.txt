•ANATOSDr. 384 name, prickle cells, employed by Scbultze. The cells whi ch lie next the horny stratum assume the scale-like form. It is in the,cells of the mucous stratum that the colouring matter of the skin is found, which in the fair races of men forms the isolated coloured spots called freckles and moles, but in the dark races the pigment granules are uniformly distributed through the cells of this stratum. The super- ficial cells of the horny stratum of the cuticle are continually being shed, so that the cells of the deeper layers gradually approach the surface, and new cells are continually being formed in the deeper part of the rete .Malpighii. The cuticle is closely adherent to the cutis in the healthy living skin, but on the application of a blister, or when putrefac- tion sets in after death, they separate from each other. The Cutis vera.—When the cuticle is removed the surface of the cutis is seen to be studded with multitudes of minute elevations, the papiUas of the skin. These papiUse are either simple conical structures, or compound with two or three branches. They are largest in the palm and sole, being from ^^^th to ^^^th of an inch high, and are arranged in ridges, but more usuaUy they are much shorter and irregularly distributed. The cutis is formed of connec- tive tissue, in which stellate connective tissue corpuscles and elastic fibres are abundant. The deeper surface of the connective tissue of the cutis is reticulated, and is continu- ous with the bundles of connective tissue that form the areolar subcutaneous tissue. In the papillae themselves the fibres of the connective tissue are not so well marked, and the surface of the papiUse possesses more of a homoge- neous aspect, which gives rise to the appearance described as a basement membrane. The cutis is highly vascu-

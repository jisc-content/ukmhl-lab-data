483 INTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERY. cl. Peroneal, a large brancli, which descends under cover of the soleus and flexor longus hallucis, and in close rela- tion to the fibula as far as the lower end of the leg when it passes to the outer ankle, where it terminates. It supplies mtiscular branches to the muscles of the back and outer side of the leg: a nutrient branch to the fibula : an anterior peroneal or perforating branch pierces the interosseous membrane, and descends to the outer side of the front of the ankle: a communicating branch runs transversely behind the lower end of the tibia, and joins the posterior tibial artery. It is not uncommon to find the peroneal artery much larger than the posterior tibial is below the origin of the peroneal, in which case the communicating branch is also enlarged, and through it the blood flows into the lower end of the tibial and the plantar arteries. The Internal Plantar artery is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the posterior tibial artery. It passes forwards close to the inner border of the sole of the foot as far as the root of the great toe, and is accompanied by the internal plantar nerve ; it is covered by the abduc- tor hallucis muscle. It supplies marginal branches to the skin of the inner border of the foot, and muscular branches to the abductor haUucis and flexor brevis digitorum. The External Plantar artery, the larger of the two ter- minal branches of the posterior tibial, inclines forwards and outwards from the inner ankle as far as the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, and is accompanied by the external plantar nerve ; it then runs inwards and forwards through the deepest part of the sole as far as the first metatarsal space, where it joins the dorsal artery of the foot, and forms

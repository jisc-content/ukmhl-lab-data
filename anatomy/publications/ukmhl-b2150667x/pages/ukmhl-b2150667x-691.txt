PERITONEUM. 675 parietal and visceral portion of the peritoneum, whicli lies next to the cavity, is free, smooth, covered by an epithe- lium, and lubricated by a little serous fluid, which under some pathological conditions may be greatly increased in quantity, so as to cause abdominal dropsy. The moisten- ing of the two free surfaces by the serum permits them to glide smoothly on each other, during the movements of the viscera, and the changes which take place in their size and position. The opposite surface of the peritoneum is attached—that of the parietal part to the fasciae situated internal to the abdominal muscles—that of the visceral part to the subjacent coat of the several organs. The attached surface of the parietal part is connected to the abdominal fasciae by areolar tissue, which is usually so loose as to permit the peritoneum to be stripped off with out difficulty. In some localities, as the region of the kidneys, the iliac fossae and the inguinal regions, fatty tissue, often in considerable quantities, is developed ex- ternal to the peritoneum. To this fat, and the areolar tissue in which it lies, the name of sub-peritoneal fat and areolar tissue is usually applied, but the name exti'a-peri- toneal would more appropriately express its position. It is in this fat and areolar tissue that the extra-peritoneal vessels, already referred to (pp. 432, 525), ramify. The parietal part of the peritoneum is in some localities elevated into folds, or dimpled into fossae. In the middle of the anterior abdominal wall, is a longitudinal fold ex- tending from the fundus of the bladder to the navel, and marking the position of the obliterated urachus. On each side of, and somewhat removed from, this mesial fold is a lateral fold, also extending towards the navel, and mark-

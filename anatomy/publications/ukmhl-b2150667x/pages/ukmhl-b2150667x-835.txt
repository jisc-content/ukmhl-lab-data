819 UEETHRA. part of the urethra has already been described; the spongy part will be considered along with the penis; the mem- branous part will now be examined. The membranous part of the urethra curves, with the concavity directed forwards, under the pubic arch, from the apex of the prostate gland to the bulbous portion of the spongy part of the urethra. It is the shortest part of the canal, measures about f inch along its anterior wall, and about J inch along its posterior wall. It is the narrowest part of the urethra, and in some cases apparently is not more than about J inch in circumference, but it is capable of being more widely distended. It pierces the trian- gular ligament of the urethra before it joins the bulb, and diminishes somewhat in calibre as it passes through it; the fibrous membrane of this ligament supports and gives an investment to the membranous part of the urethra. It is also surrounded by the constrictor urethrse muscle. It is lined by mucous membrane, and its wall not only contains the nonstriped fibro-muscular elements met with generally throughout the urethra, but a vascular, cavernous venous plexus. A few racemose glands open on the free surface of its mucous lining. The Compressor or Constrictor Urethras is a striped muscle passing across the pubic arch, to the sides of which it is attached. In its course it completely surrounds the membranous part of the urethra, to which it acts as a sphincter muscle. It is quite distinct from the non-striped circular muscular fibres, in relation to the submucous coat of the urethra.

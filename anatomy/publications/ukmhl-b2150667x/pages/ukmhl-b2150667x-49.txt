AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 33 head. It consists originally of two separate halves, which unite during the first year of life into a single bone at the symphysis or chin. A characteristic feature of the human lower jaw is the forward slope of the bone at the chin, for in other mammals the symphysis inclines backwards. In the upper border of this bone are the sockets for the lower series of teeth. At the posterior end of the horse-shoe curve on each side the bone ascends almost vertically, and terminates in two processes—an anterior, or coronoid, which is for the insertion of the temporal muscle, and a posterior, or condyle, which is for articulation with the glen- oid fossa of the temporal bone. Where the ascending and horizontal limbs of the bone are continuous, it forms the angle, which is almost a right angle. On the inner surface of the ascending limb is a large foramen, communicating with a canal which traverses the bone below the sockets for the teeth. In this canal are lodged the nerves and blood-vessels for these teeth. The Hyoid bone Ues in the neck, a little below the lower border of the inferior maxilla (Figs. 6 and 7). It is shaped like the letter U, and consists of a body, or hasi- hyal, from which two long horns, or stylo-hyals, project backwards. At the junction of the body and horns two smaUer cornua, or cerato-hyals, project upwards, and are connected with the styloid processes of the temporal bones, or stylo-hyals, by the stylo-hyoid ligaments, or epi-hyals. The hyoid is the bone from which the muscles of the tongue anse, and it is situated immediately above the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, to which it is attached by ligaments. In its general form the SkuU is ovoid, with the long axis extending antero-posteriorly, the frontal and occipital

ARTICULATOEY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 67 articular surfaces of diarthrodial joints are retained in apposition with each other, some- times by investing ligaments, at others by surrounding muscles and tendons; at others by atmospheric pressure, aided by the adhesive character of the interposed synovia. The form of the articular or mov- able surfaces varies very materi- ally in different examples of these joints, and the modifications in ^'•'•i^-—'Vertical section through a diarthrodial joint, in which lorm determine the direction of cavity is suijdivided into two by an interposed fibro-car- the movements of the ioints Tn ^'l^^'^ °'" ™eniscus, fc.

In other joints the articular surfaces may be regarded as produced by the rotation of a straight or curved line about an axis lying in the same plane; these are cM rotation joints, and they present various modifica- tions according to the direction and relation of the rotat- ing hue to the axis. One form of a rotation joint is the pivot joznt, in which the movement takes place about the axis of one of the bones, which is the axis of rotation of the joint; examples of this joint are found in the joint between the atlas and odontoid process of the axis and the radio-ulnar joint. Another form is the ffinffhjrm^ or hinge Joint, in which the axis of rotation of the joint is perpendicular to the axes of the two bones; the move- ments of the hinge are called flexion when the angle

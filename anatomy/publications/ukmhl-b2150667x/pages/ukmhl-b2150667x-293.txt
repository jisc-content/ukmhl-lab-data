277 THE BEAINâ€”CEREBRUM. tlie corpus callosum rests is exposed. If the anterior lialf of the corpus callosum be now turned forward, the grey partition, or septum lucidum, between the two lateral ventri- cles is exposed. This septum fits into the interval between the under surface of the corpus callosum and the upper surface of the anterior part of the fornix. It consists of two layers of grey matter, between which is a narrow ver- tical mesial space, the Jifih ventricle. If the septum be now removed, the anterior part of the fornix is brought into view. The fornix or arch is an arch-shaped band of nerve fibres extending in the antero-posterior direction. Its ante- rior end forms the anterior piers or pillars of the arch, its posterior end posterior piers er pillars, whilst the inter- mediate bodi/ of the fornix forms the summit or crown of the arch. It consists of two lateral halves, one belonging to each hemisphere. At the summit of the arch the two lateral halves are conjoined to form the body; but in front of the body the two halves separate from each other, and form two anterior pillars, which descend in front of the third ventricle to the base of the cerebrum, where they form the corpora'alhicantia, and then enter the substance of the optic thalamus. Behind the body the two halves diverge much more from each other, and form the posterior pillars; each of which curves downwards and outwards into the descending cornu of the ventricle, and, under the name of tcenia hippocampi, forms the free border of the hippocampus major. If the body of the fornix be now divided by a transverse incision, its anterior part thrown forwards, and its posterior part backwards, the great trans- verse fissure of the cerebrum is opened into, and the velum mterpositum lying in that fissure is exposed (Fig. 90).

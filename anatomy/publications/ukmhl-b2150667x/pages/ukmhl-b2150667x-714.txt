698 ANATOMY. divided into three portions, named duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The Duodenum is the commencement of the small in- testine, and has received its name from its length being regarded as about equal to the breadth of twelve fingers. It forms the shortest and widest of the three sub-divisions of the small bowel; it curves, in the form of a horse-shoe, from the pylorus to opposite the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, where it becomes continuous with the jejunum. It is customary to regard it as consist- ing of three parts, an ascending, a descending, and atrans'.- verse. The ascending part runs from before backward slightly upwards and to the right, from the epigastrium into the right hypochondrium, where it comes in contact with the under surface of the liver and gaU bladder, and is usually stained green by the bile. The descending part passes downwards into the right lumbar region, as far as the second or third vertebra. â€¢ It lies between the pancreas and right kidney, goes behind the transverse colon and the meso-colon; and the common bile duct, running down behind its left border, perforates its wall along with the pancreatic duct. The transverse part extends into the umbilical region, lies behind the stomach and transverse colon, and becomes continuous with the jejunum at the line where the small intestine is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery. The head of the pancreas lies in the concavity of the horse-shoe curve of the duodenum. The duodenum is that part of the smaU intestine which is most fixed in its position. Its ascending part is con- nected to the liver by a fold of peritoneum, sometimes

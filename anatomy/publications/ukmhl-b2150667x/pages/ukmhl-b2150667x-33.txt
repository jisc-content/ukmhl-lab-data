AXIAL SKELETONâ€”SPINE. 17 a lateral. The antero-posterior is the more important. In the infant at the time of birth the sacro-coccygeal part of the spine is concave forwards, but the rest of the spine, except a slight forward concavity in the series of dorsal vertebrae, is almost straight. When the infant begins to sit up in the arms of its nurse, a convexity for- wards in the region of the neck appears, and subsequently, as the child learns to walk, a convexity forwards in the region of the loins. Hence in the adult spine a series of convexo-concave cm-ves are found, which are alternate and mutually dependent, and are associated with the erect attitude of man. In the human spine alone are the lumbar vertebrae convex forward. A lateral curve, convex to the right, opposite the third, fourth, and fifth dorsal vertebrae, with compensatory curve convex to the left immediately above and below, is due apparently to the much greater use of the muscles of the right arm over those of the left, drawing the spine in that region some- what to the right. In disease of the spine its natural curvatures are much increased, and the deformity known as humpback is produced. As the spine forms the central part of the axial skeleton, it acts as a coliunn to support not only the weight of the body, but of aU that can be carried on the head, back, and in the upper limbs : by its transverse and spinous processes it serves also to give attachment to numerous muscles, and the transveree pro- cesses of its dorsal vertebrae are also for articulation with the ribs.

7 INTRODUCTION. of the body are not homogeneous in structure, but are built up of several systems of organs, each system being charac- terised not only by peculiarities in form, appearance, and. structure, but by possessing special functions and uses. Thus the bones collectively form the Osseous system; the joints the Articulatory system; the muscles, which move the bones at the joints, the Muscular system; and these several systems collectively constitute the organs of Locomotion. The brain, spinal marrow, sympathetic ganglia, and nerves, form the Nervous system, with which is intimately asso- ciated the organs of Sense; the blood and lymph vessels, the Vascular system; the lungs and windpipe, the Kespira- tory system; the alimentary canal, with the glands opening into it, the Digestive system; the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, the Urinary system; the testicles, spermatic ducts, and penis in the male, with the ovaries, uterus, and clitoris in the female, the Generative or Reproductive system; the skin, with the hair and nails, the Tegumentary system- These various systems are so arranged with reference to each other as to form an organic whole. The Organs of Locomotion will first attract our attention.

Watney states that a deli- cate reticulum continuous with the most superficial layer of corpuscles of the connective tissue is prolonged between the epithelium cells. In the axis of the viUus one, or perhaps two, minute lacteals or chyle vessels are situated, which serve as rootlets of origin of the lacteal division of the lymph vascular system. The lacteal is a capillary tube, which ends near the apex of the villus, as a dilated microscopic cul-de-sac. By its opposite extremity it becomes continuous with a plexus of lacteals in the submucous coat. When treated with nitrate Fig. 190.â€”A transverse section throngli an intestinal Villus A, showing its epi- thelial investment and the matiix of Lymphoid tissue; c, columnar epithelium ; g, goblet-shaped cell; I, lacteal; r, r, lymphoid retiform tissue; v, d, trans- versely divided blood-vessels. B, free ends of columnar epithelium, with mouths of four goblet-shaped cells. X 300. of silver, its wall is seen to consist of flattened endothelial cells, which are connected with the retiform tissue of the matrix substance. In the matrix substance, around the lacteal vessel of the villus, is a layer of non-striped mus- cular fibro-cells, which is continuous with the general muscular layer of the mucous coat, and extends as far as the apex of the villus. By the contraction of this layer the chyle during absorption is propelled along the lacteal

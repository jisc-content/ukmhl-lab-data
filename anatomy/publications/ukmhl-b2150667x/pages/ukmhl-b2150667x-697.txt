PERITONEUM. 681 descends in front of tlie aorta and lumbar spine into the pelvis, where it invests the upper end of the rectum and forms the meso-rechm. It only partially covers the second part of the rectum, and is reflected from it to the base and sides of the bladder to form the posterior false ligaments of the bladder. Between the bladder and the rectum the peri- toneum forms a well-defined pouch, the recto-vesical pouch. In the female the uterus and vagina being interposed between the rectum and bladder, the disposition of the pelvic part of the peritoneum is modified as follows :â€” The membrane passes from the rectum to the upper end of the back of the vagina, and is then prolonged over the pos- terior surface of the uterus, the fundus uteri, and Fallopian tubes, and over about the upper two-thirds of the anterior surface of the uterus. From the sides of the uterus it is reflected to the sides of the pelvic cavity as the broad ligaments of the uterus, and from the front of the uterus to the back of the bladder. In both sexes the bladder has no peritoneal covering on its anterior wall, for the mem- brane is reflected from its sides to the pelvic wall, as the lateral false ligaments, and from its fundus along the line of the urachus to the anterior abdominal wall, as the superior false ligament. The spleen is invested by the peritoneum, which is reflected from its hilus to the stomach, as the two layers of the gasiro-splenic omentum, which again becomes con tinuous with the great omentum. The vessels and nerves which pass to the spleen lie between the two layers of the gastro-splenic omentum; those which go to the stomach between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum, also between the two descending layers of the great omentum; 2 X

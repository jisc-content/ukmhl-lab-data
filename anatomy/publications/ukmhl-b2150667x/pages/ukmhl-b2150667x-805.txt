Each vas afferens, invested by its sheath of connective tissue, passes to a Bowman's capsule in its immediate neighbourhood, the wall of which it appears to perforate at one pole. It divides in the capsule into from four to eight branches, which subdivide into capillaries, and form a vascular tuft or glomerulus, called the MalpigJiian tuft, situated opposite to the junction of the capsule with the urinary tubule. From the capillaries of the tuft a vessel arises, which Fig 222â€”Section through the cortex of the kidney.

It usually emerges quite close to the vas afferens, but at once diverges from it, and after a short course ends in a net- work of capillaries, distributed between and around the convoluted tubules (fig. 222).

9 SKELETON. body, and is termed an exo- or dermo-sheleton. In some vertebrates {e.g., the armadillo, tortoise, and sturgeon), in addition to the proper endo-skeleton, skeletal plates are developed in connection with the integument, so that they possess a dermo-skeleton likewise. In some vertebrates, also, a partial skeleton is formed within the substance of some of the visceraâ€”e.g., in ruminant animals a bone is situated in the heart; in the walrus and other carnivora, in rodents, bats, and some monkeys, a bone lies in the penis; and in the leopard, jackal, and other carnivora, a cartilaginous style lies in the middle of the tongue. These parts form a splanchno- or visceral skeleton. By some anatomists the teeth, which are unquestionably hard parts of the body, are also referred to the splanchno-skeleton, though they are special modifications of the mucous mem- brane of the gum. In man, the teeth being excluded, there is neither exo- nor splanchno-skeleton, but only an endo-skeleton. In each of the great subdivisions of the body an endo- skeleton exists, so that we may speak of an Axial Skeleton and an Appendicular Skeleton. The x^ial Skeleton con- sists of the bones of the spine and head, the ribs, and the breastbone; the Appendicular Skeleton, of the bones of the limbs. The number of bones in the skeleton varies at different periods of life. In the adult there are about 200, but in the child they are more numerous; for in the pro- cess of consolidation of the skeleton certain bones originally distinct become fused together.

SMALL INTESTINE. 701 The serous, or external coat, derived from tlie peri- toneum, forms a complete investment for the jejunum and ileum, and is continuous with the mesentery along a line of attachment, named the mesenteric border of the in- testine. The ascending part of the duodenum also has a complete serous coat, but the serous covering of the de- scending and transverse portions is limited to their an- terior surface. The serous coat of the small intestine is loosely united to the subjacent muscular coat by areolar tissue, which is sometimes called the subserous coat. The muscular coat consists of non-striped fibres arranged in two layers from without inwards. The outer layer consists of longitudinal fasciculi, which form a thin layer parallel to the long axis of the intestine. The inner layer consists of circular fasciculi arranged around the gut transverse to its long axis : this layer is thicker, stronger, and more highly coloured than the longitudinal layer. By the contraction of the muscular coat, the peristaltic or vermicular movement is produced, which propels the ingested materials along the intestine. The submucous coat lies immediately subjacent to the circular layer of the muscular coat, and forms the bond of union between that coat and the mucous membrane. It consists of areolar connective tissue, and in it the blood- vessels ramify before they pass into the mucous mem- brane. The mucous, or internal coat, is a soft, velvety-looking membrane, which lines the wall of the small intestine, and possesses a complex appearance and structure. The inner surface is not smooth, but is thrown into strongly-marked folds, the valvules conniventes, which, are not obliterated

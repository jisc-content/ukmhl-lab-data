CRANIAL BLOOD SINUSES. 511 dura mater immediately adjacent to each, sinus. They are without valves; but the superior longitudinal sinus has an irregular inner surf ace, owing to the projection of fibrous bands into its lumen. The Veins of the Beain ramify in the pia mater, and are arranged in a superficial and a deep group :— The superficial veins of the cerebrum pass out of the convolutions into the pia mater covering the outer surface tiG. 138.—Dura mater and Cranial Sinuse.?. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium ; 3, 3, siiperior longitudinal sinus; 4, lateral sinus; 5, internal jugular vein; 6, occi- pital sinus; 6', torcular Herophili; 7, inferior longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of Oalen; 9 and 10, superior and inferior petrosal sinuses; 11, cavernous sinus ; 12, circular sinus, which connects the two cavernous sinuses together; 13, ophthal- mic Toin from 15, the eyeball; 14, crista gaUi of ethmoid bone. and the inner face of the cerebral hemispheres, and open into the superior longitudinal sinus, though some of the veins of the inner face open into the inferior longitudinal sinus.

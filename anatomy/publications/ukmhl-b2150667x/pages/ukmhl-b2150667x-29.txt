AXIAL SKELETONâ€”SPINE. IB and the second vertebra below. The second vertebra, Axis, or Vertebra dentata, has its body surmounted by a thick tooth-like odontoid process, which is regarded as the body of the atlas displaced from its proper vertebra and fused with the axis. This process forms a pivot round which the atlas and head move in turning the head from one side to the other; the spine is large, thick, and deeply bifid. The seventh, called Vertebra prominens, is distinguished by its long prominent spine, which is not bifid, and by the small size of the foramen at the root of the transverse process. In the human spine the distinguishing character of all the cervical vertebrae is the foramen at the root of the transverse process, but amongst mammals this is not an invariable character, for in the cetacea the transverse process of the atlas is imperforate, and in the horse, ruminants, and many quadrumana, the seventh cervical vertebra has no foramen at the root of its transverse process. The Dorsal Vertebrae, more appropriately called costal or thoracic, are twelve in number in the human spine; but amongst mammals they range from eleven in the arma- dUlo to twenty-two in the Cape hyrax and Hoffmann's sloth. They are intermediate in size and position to the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and are all distinguished by having one or two smooth surfaces on each side of the body for articulation with the head of one or two ribs. The arch is short and with imbricated laminae ; the ring is nearly circular ] the spine is oblique, elongated, and bayonet-shaped ; the transverse processes are directed back and out, not bifid, and with an articular surface in front for the tubercle of a rib; and the articular processes

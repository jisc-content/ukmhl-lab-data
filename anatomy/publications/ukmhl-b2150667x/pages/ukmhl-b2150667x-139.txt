123 THE BLOOD. ms, and he concludes that -the smallest blood discs occur in the small species of an order or family, the largest in the large species. In birds they are larger than in mam- mals, and vary in length from an ave- rage of yJ^y inch in Oamarins javanicus to ■g-jVs'tli Linaria minor. In reptUes they are still larger, and vary in length Fig. 28.—l, red corpuscles of human blood ; 2, red corpuscles of blood of common fowl, seen on irom an average OI the surface and edgeways ; 3, red coi-puscles of , . . frog; 4, of Sgualus squatina; 5, of Lophius •j-j-Yg-th m AngUlS ■phcatm-ius; 6, corpuscles of the blood of a scor- fragilis to xuVt*^ Lacerta viridis. In amphibia the largest corpuscles, accord- ing to Gulliver, are about -^^-^ inch in length in Proteus and Siren, though RiddeU states that in Amplmima tridactylum they are id larger; whilst the smallest, as in the common frog, average in length xtVs' i^ich. In cartilaginous fish the corpuscles are larger than in osseous. In Lamna cor- nuhica GuUiver found their long diameter to be -j-J^ inch ; while in the Salmonidse, which have the largest blood discs among osseous fish, the long diameter in the salmon and common trout is only about t-j^^^ inch. The white or colourless corpuscles are comparatively few in number in the healthy human blood. Welcker has estimated the normal relative number as one white to 335 red; in pregnant and menstruating women the pro- portion is increased to about 1 to 280. In some forms of

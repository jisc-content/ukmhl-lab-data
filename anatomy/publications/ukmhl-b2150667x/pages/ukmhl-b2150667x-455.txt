439 SUBCLAVIAN SYSTEM OF ARTERIES. reaches the upper border of the scapula, and passes over the supra-scapular ligament to the dorsum of the scapula, where it ramifies in the supra and infra spinous foss^, and supplies the muscles on the dorsum scapulae. The Transversalis Colli passes outwards behind the sterno-mas- toid and above the clavicle ; it then goes under cover of the trapezius, and divides into the sitperjicial cervical and pos- terior scapular branches; the superficial cervical ends in the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles; the posterior scapular runs parallel to the posterior border of th.e scapula, supplies the muscles attached to that border, and gives branches to the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the scapula. The transversalis colli artery varies in its arrangement in different individuals; it not unfrequently ends in the trapezius, and represents in its distribution the superficial cervical branch; in these cases the posterior scapular branch arises directly from the subclavian. c. Internal Mammarij arises from the lower surface of the first part of the subclavian, passes into the thorax behind the cartilage of the first rib, and descends behind the internal intercostal muscles and costal cartilages as far as the sixth intercostal space, where it divides into the rmisculo-phrenic and superior epigastric branches. The costal pleura lies immediately behind the upper part of the artery, but its lower part is separated from the pleura by the triangularis sterni muscle. In its course the following branches arise:â€”arteria comes nervi plirenici, which accompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm: mediastinal branches to the thymus gland, pericardium, and areolar tissue of the mediastinal space: perforating branches, which pierce the internal intercostal and greater

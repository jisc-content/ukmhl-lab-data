ANATOMY. 268 and backwards across tlie line of the squamous suture near its middle. The area covered by the parietal bone so far then, from being co-terminous with the parietal lobe of the cerebrum, is trench- ed on anteriorly by the frontal, poste- riorly by the occi- pital, and inferiorly by the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. The convolutions of the parietal lobe itself are grouped around the parietal eminence, and in the interval between it and the sagittal suture. The inner table of the cranial bones is an almost exact mould of the Fig 87.-Orbital surface of the left frontal lobe convolutions of these and the island of ReU; the tip of the tempore- i , -i , .i - â€¢ sphenoidal lohe has been removed to display the 10 DCS , OUT- LUiti i& latter. 17, convolution of the margin of the longi- tudinal fissure; 0, olfactory fissure, over which nOt SO WltU tUC CX- the olfactory pedimcle and lobe are situated; .

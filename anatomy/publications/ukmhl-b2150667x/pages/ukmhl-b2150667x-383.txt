THE EAR. 367 utriculus, and they open by five orifices into it. Each has an ampulla within the ampulla of the osseous canal. Both the sacculus and utriculus are in places attached to the periosteal Hning of the osseous vestibule, and delicate hgamentous bands connect the membranous semicircular canals to the periosteal lining of the tubes in which they are contained. The wall of the membranous vestibule and canals consists of a delicate fibrous membrane lined by a tesseUatecjjPpithelium. The inner part of this mem- brane has a vitreous or hyaline lustre, and gives origin in the canals to short papHlse which project into the lumen. The membranous vestibule and canals are distended with the fluid endolymph. The sacculus, utriculUvS, and ampullee are specially modified in connection with the peripheral termination of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve. The membranous wall forms in each of these dilatations a projecting ridge, the crista acoustica, to which calcareous particles, the otoliths, which may be either amorphous or crystalline, are adherent. The epithelial investment of the crista is elongated into columnar cells, and intercalated between them are fusiform cells, the audi- tory cells, each of which, as Schixltze and other observers have described, possesses a peripheral and a central process. The peripheral process projects beyond the plane of the free surface of the endothelium into the endolymph as the auditory hair, whilst the central process extends into the sub-epithelial tissue, where the nerve plexus belonging to the terminal branches of the auditory nerve ramifies, and with â€¢which it is probably continuous (Fig. 108). These auditory cells are, therefore, the peripheral end-organs of the vesti- bular branches of the auditory nerve, and their general

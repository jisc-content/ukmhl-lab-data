It is about •^th inch long, and shaped like the shell of a common snail; its base lies near the internal meatus, and its apex is directed Fig. 109.-Diagram of the membranous LalDyrinth. OUtwards.

The tube is im- perfectly divided into two passages by a plate of bone, the osseous spiral lamina, which, springing from the modiolus, winds spirally around it, and projects into the tube. When the membranous cochlea is in its place the division is completed by a membrane, the membranous spiral lamina, or hadlar membrane, which bridges across the interval between the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina and the outer waU of the tube, to the latter of which it is attached by the spiral cochlear ligament. These passages are called scala tympani and scala vestibuli. But another membrane also, the membrane of Eeissner, arises from a denticulated spiral crest, the limbus or crista spiralis, attached to the vestibular border of the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina, and extends to the spiral Hga- ment at the outer wall of the tube, on the vestibular aspect

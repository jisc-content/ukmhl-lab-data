ANATOMY, 395 overlap the pericardium, and lie between it and the sternum and costal cartilages. The pericardium is sepa- rated from the spine by the contents of the posterior mediastinum. It is attached below to the central tendon of the diaphragm, and blends above with the sheaths of the great vessels which pass to and from the heart. Two fibrous bands, the stemo-pericardiac ligaments of Luschka, are connected to its anterior surface; the superior ligament springs partly from the back of the manubrium, and is partly continuous with the cervical fascia; whilst the inferior ligament proceeds from the inner side of the base of the xiphi sternum.

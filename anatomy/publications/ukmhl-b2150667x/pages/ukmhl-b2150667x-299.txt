INTERNAL STEUCTUEE OF THE CEEEBRUM. 283 midal cells lie in the third and fourth layers. L. Clarke stated that the^ cells of all the layers of the posterior or occipital lobe were small and of nearly uniform size, whilst in the convolutions anterior to it numerous cells of a much larger kind were found; but though it is undoubtedly true that large pyramidal cells are found in the frontal lobe in considerable numbers, and that the greater number of the cells of the occipital lobe are smaU and nearly uniform in size, there is no difficulty in recognising in the occipital lobe a small proportion of cells, quite equal in magnitude to the Iflro-pof nolle r,f -Pv^v^+^l FiG. 92.—Vertical section through the 3(1 largest CeUS or tJie frontal ami 4th layers of gi-ey matter of the l^-L- .„ 1 , superior frontal convolution.

According to Clelaud, the elongated apices of the cells, which are directed to the surface of the convolu- tion, are continuous with the nerve fibres situated in the superficial layer of horizontal fibres.

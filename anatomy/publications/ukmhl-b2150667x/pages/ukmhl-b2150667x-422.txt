ANATOMY. 406 bicuspid valve; and as these cusps are placed one in fronb of the other like the segments of a bishop's mitre, the name mitral valve is often given to it. The cusps agree in shape, general arrangement, and mode of attachment with those of the tricuspid valve, but they are stronger. The more posterior segment lies in relation to the posterior wall of the ventricle : the more anterior segment lies obliquely between the auricular and aortic orifices, and is charac- terized by being smooth on both its surfaces. At the angles between the bases of attachment of the two large cusps of this valve two small intermediate cusps are situated. The chordce tendinece, springing from each mus- culus papillaris separate, as on the right side, into two groups, one for each of the two cusps. From the base of this ventricle the great systemic artery or aorta arises through the intervention of a strong fibrous ring. The mouth of the aorta is surrounded by a three-segmented semilunar valve, similar in form, mode of attachment, and structure to the semilunar pulmonary valve, but with thicker and stronger segments, and possessing more strongly marked sinuses of Valsalva. The segments are placed, one in relation to the posterior wall of the aorta, and two to its antero-lateral wall. The base of each ventricle has therefore two openings in it, one for communication with the auricle, the other with the great artery arising from the ventricle. The auriculo-ventricular openings are the most posterior, and almost in the same transverse plane; the aortic opening lies in front of the interval between the two auriculo-ventricular, and the pulmonary opening is in front of the aortic. The relation which these openings have to the anterior

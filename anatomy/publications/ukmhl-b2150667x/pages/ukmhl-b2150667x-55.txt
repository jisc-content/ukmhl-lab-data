APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 39 The spine ^ arches forwards, to end in a broad flattened process, the acromion, which has an oval articular surface for the clavicle; both spine and acromion are largely developed in the human scapula in correlation with the great size of the trapezius and deltoid muscles, which are con- cerned in the elevation and ab- duction of the upper Hmb. The borders of the scapula, directed upwards, backwards, and down- wards, give attachment to several muscles. The angles are inferior, supero-posterior, and supero-an- terior. The supero-anterior is the most important; it is trancated, and presents a large, shallow, oval, smooth surface, the glenoid fossa, for articulation with the humerus, to form the shoulder joint. Over- hanging the glenoid fossa is a curved beak-like process, the coracoid, which is of importance as corresponding with the separate coracoid bone of birds and reptiles. The line of demarcation between it and the scapula proper is marked on the upper border of the scapula by the supra-scapular notch. Fig. 9.—The Appondiculav Skele- ton of the Left Upper Limb.

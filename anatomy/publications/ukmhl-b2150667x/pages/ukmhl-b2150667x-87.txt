AKTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 71 also arises within the muscle, and conveys the fluid lymph out of the muscle. Each muscle also is pene- trated by a nerve, by which it is brought into connection with the brain, and along which the nervous impulse, started by the WiU, is conveyed. The Will is the natural stimulus for exciting muscular action, which action is in many cases so rapid that scarcely an appreciable interval of time intervenes between willing and doing the action. The bones form a series of rod-like levers, and, in study- ing the mode of action of the muscles, the place of inser- tion of the muscle into the bone—^that is to say, the point of application of the power which causes the movement— and its relations to the joint, or fulcrum, or centre of motion, and to the weight or resistance which is to be overcome, have to be kept in view. The relative positions of ful- crum, point of application of power, and resistance, are not the same in aU the bony levers. As a rule, the muscles are inserted into bones between the fulcrum and the mov- able point of resistance, and nearer the fulcrum than the movable point, as may be seen in the muscles which bend the fore-arm at the elbow-joint. Although from the weight- arm of the lever being in these cases much longer than the power-arm, the muscles, as regards the application of the power, act at a disadvantage, yet the movement gains in velocity. Sometimes the muscle is inserted, as is the case in the great muscle which straightens or extends the fore-arm, at one end of the lever, and the fulcrum or joint is placed between it and the movable point. At other times, as in the case of the chief depressor muscle of the lower jaw, whilst the muscle is attached to one end of the lever, the fulcrum is at the opposite end. When a

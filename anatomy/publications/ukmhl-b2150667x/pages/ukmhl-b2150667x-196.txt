180 ANATOMY. The Transversely Striped fibre is the characteristic tissue of the voluntary muscular system, and is found wherever energetic movements are to be performed. In these muscles the fibres are coUected together in fascicuH, which bundles usually Ue parallel to each other, and extend from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. Each muscle is invested by a membranous sheath formed of connective tissue, the perimydum externum, which sheath gives off processes that dip into the substance of the muscle, so as to form delicate partitions between the fasciculi, and from these partitions still more slender prolongations of connec- tive tissue, named perirtiyskm internum, pass between the fibres The bundles of the perimysium are described by Thin as invested by a layer of flat cells. The number and size of the fasciculi vary with the size and texture of the muscle; in some, as the deltoid and glutaeus maximus, the fascicuU are large and coarse; whilst in others, as the graciUs and omo-hyoid, they are much finer The number of fibres in a fasciculus varies with its length and tHckness, and the fibres wHch are adjacent to each other in a fasciculus He paraUeL The striped fibres are cyUndrical or lateraUy com- pressed; they usuaUy taper off at their extremities, and apparently do not, even in muscles with long fascicuh, exceed U inch in length. The transverse diameter of the striped fibres varies, in different localities in the human body, from ,i,th to ^V.tb inch, according to the measure- ments of Kolliker. Much wider differences m diameter are found in the animal series, in insects the fibres being of extreme minuteness, whilst in cold-blooded animals they are much larger than in man and mammals.

270 ANATOMY. annectent gyrus, and the superior occipital convolution, which, are continuous with each other, as forming collec- tively a superior tier. The supra-marginal convolution, the angular gyrus, the second annectent, and middle occipital gyri, may be looked upon as members of a second or in- ferior tier, though their foldings are often so complex as to add materially to the difficulty of determining their continuity. The gyri of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, again, are characterised by their correspondence in direc- tion with the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure, below which they lie. By their upper ends they blend with the middle and inferior occipital gyri, and with the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, and thus, as it were, continue the posterior convolutions of the inferior tier downwards and forwards to the tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. In this manner the convolutions just referred to are so associated together as to be grouped around, and form, if one may so express it, a cap or hood, which encloses the convolutions of the central lobe or island of ReU; and this in so effectual a manner, that it is rare to find any of that structure exposed. It is by the great development of the inferior frontal gyrus, the lower ends of the two ascending convolutions, the supra-marginal convolution, the angular and inferior temporo-sphenoidal gyri, that the Hps of the Sylvian fissure are so closely approximated, that the island is completely concealed within it. Convolutions also exist on the inner surface of the hemisphere, and on the under surface which rests on the tentorium, but these have no relation to the bones of the cranial vault. They may be studied in connection with the corpus caUosum or great transverse commissure, which

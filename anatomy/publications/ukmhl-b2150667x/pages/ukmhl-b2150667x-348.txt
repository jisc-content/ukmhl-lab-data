332 ANATOMY. derived from the blood, and in part produced by prolifera- tion of the proper cornea corpuscles. The intercellular matrix of the cornea consists of a laminated substance, the lamellse being arranged parallel to the surfaces of the cornea. The lamellse consist of extremely delicate filaments, collected into bundles, which are invested, according to Thin, by flattened cells, like the cellular investment r. of the bundles of a tendon. Im- mediately under the anterior epithelium the fasciculi decus- sate with each other, and at the circum- ference of the cor- nea the fasciculi run into the connective tissue of the sclero- tic.

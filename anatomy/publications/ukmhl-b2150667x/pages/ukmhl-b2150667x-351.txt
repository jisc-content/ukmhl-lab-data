335 THE EYEBALL. THE MIDDLE OR VASCULAR TUNIC. The Choroid coat forms the largest portion of the middle coat of the eyeball. It lies immediately internal to the sclerotic, and extends as far forward as the corpus cUiare, or aunulus albidus, where it forms the ciliary processes ; it is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve. It has a deep black colom-, from the numerous pigment ceUs it contains, and is abundantly provided with blood-vessels and nerves. The Corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, is a greyish-white ring which surrounds the anterior border of the choroid close to the junction of the sclerotic and cornea. It consists of two portions—an external, the ciliary muscle, which lies next the sclerotic, and an internal, the ciliary processes. The ciliary processes, about 80 in number, are folds of the middle tunic separated from each other by furrows which extend forwards in the meridional direction as far as the iris, and form collectively a zone-like plated frill around the circumference of the iris. On the one hand, they are continuous with the vasculo-pigmentary structures of the choroid; on the other, with the vasculo-pigmentary struc- tures of the iris. The Iris is a circular, flattened disc-shaped diaphragm, situated behind the cornea, in front of the crystalline lens, and bathed by the aqueous humour. By its circumference or ciHary border the iris is not only continuous with the ciliary processes, but is connected by fibres, termed ligamentum pectinatum, with the posterior elastic lamina of the cornea. The iris is the structure which gives the characteristic colour to the eye—blue, grey, brown, hazel, as the case may be. It is perforated at, or immediately to

512 ANATOMY. petrosal and lateral sinuses. The veins of the upper surface of the cerebellum open into the straight sinus, those of the under surface into the lateral and occipital sinuses. The deep veins of the cerebrum emerge from the cor- pora striata and optic thalami, enter the choroid plexuses which form tho fringe of the velum interpositum, and converge to the middle of the velum, where they form the two veins of Galen. The veins of Galen run backwards close to the mesial line oE the velum, and passing along with it through the transverse fissure of the cerebrum below the posterior end of the corpus callosum, reach the tentorium cerebeUi, and enter the straight sinus. The Ophthalmic veins are two in number, a superior and an inferior. They are situated in the orbit, and are formed by the union of a number of small veins corre- sponding to the branches of the ophthalmic artery. The superior vein passes backwards through the sphenoidal fissure, and opens into the cavernous sinus. The inferior vein may have the same course, but more usually it goes through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and joins a plexus of veins in the pterygoid region, which serves as a rootlet for the internal maxillary vein. The vena centralis retincE usually opens directly into the cavernous sinus. The superior ophthalmic vein communicates with the veins of the forehead and with the angular vein, one of the rootlets of the facial vein, at the inner angle of the orbit. The Veins of the Diplok are contained in canals in the diploe of the cranial bones ; those which lie in the parietal and occipital bones communicate not only with the lateral and occipital sinuses, but with the temporal and occipital

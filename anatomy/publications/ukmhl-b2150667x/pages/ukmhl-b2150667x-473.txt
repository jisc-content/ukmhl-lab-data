COMMON CAROTID AETERY. 457 The left common carotid is longer than the right; it is placed at first in the upper part of the thorax, in which it ascends as far as the left sterno-clavicular joint; it is covered by the manubrium sterni and the remains of the thymus gland, and is crossed by the left innominate vein. It lies at first in front of the trachea, and then in front of the oesophagus and thoracic duct. In the neck each common carotid artery is enclosed along with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve in a sheath, formed of the cervical fascia; it is covered in the lower part of the neck by the sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-mastoid muscles, cervical fascia, platysma, and skin ; it is crossed opposite the cricoid cartilage by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, above which it lies in the anterior triangular space, where it is overlapped by the inner border of the sterno-mastoid, which forms a definite guide to the position of the artery, and is covered by the cervical fascia, platysma and skin. It rests behind on the cervical vertebrse, the longus colli, and rectus anticus major muscles, and the inferior thyroid artery crosses behind its sheath. To the inner side of the artery are the trachea, larynx, thyroid body and pharynx, and the thyroid body when enlarged overlaps the artery. The greater width of the larynx than of the trachea causes the two carotids to be further asunder in the upper than the lower part of their course. A chain of lymphatic glands lies in the neck parallel to the common carotid, and when enlarged they sometimes overlap the artery. The internal jugular vein descends close to the outer side of the artery in the same sheath, whilst the superior thyroid vein, which joins the internal jugular, crosses the upper part of the artery, and 2 a

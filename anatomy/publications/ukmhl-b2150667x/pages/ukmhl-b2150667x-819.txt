803 SPERMATIC COED. it presents a wrinkled appearance, ttougli it may become smooth and lax in hot weather, and in a debilitated state of the body. Beneath the skin is a thin layer of super- ficial fascia of a pale reddish tint, which contains a large quantity of non-striped muscle, and is devoid of fat. This layer is called the dartos muscle, and through its con- traction the corrugated condition of the skin of the scrotum is produced. The scrotum is divided into two lateral halves, by a median septum, into which the dartos fibres are prolonged. The position of this septum is marked, on the surface of the scrotum, by a median line or raph^, which is continuous "behind with the raph6 of the perineum. Each half of the scrotum contains a testicle and a sper- matic cord, and each testicle with its cord is enveloped by four special coverings, which are arranged from without inwards, as folkws :â€” The spermatic fascia is a thin fibrous membrane, con- tinuous above with the flattened tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, at the external or super- ficial abdominal ring. The cremaster muscle consists of fasciculi of striped muscle, continuous above with the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen : the fasciculi form a loop-like arrangement over the testicle and spermatic cord, and are attached together by intermediate areolar tissue, so as to form the cremasteric covering or fascia. The infundihuliform fascia is a very delicate layer of fibrous membrane, continuous above with the fascia trans- versalis of the abdomen, at the internal or deep abdominal ring. The tunica vaginalis is a serous membrane, the outer surface of which is connected by areolar tissue to the infundihuliform fascia. Its inner surface is smooth, and

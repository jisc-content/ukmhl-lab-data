256 ANATOMY. posterior medullary velum, wMlst the layer of grey matter stretching between the uvula and tonsil on each side is called the furrowed hand. The whole outer surface of the cerebeUum possesses a characteristic foMated or laminated appearance, due to its subdivision into multitudes of thin plates or lameU^ by numerous fissures. The cerebeUum consists both of grey and white matter. The grey matter forms the exterior or cortex of the lameUse, and passes from one to the other across the bottom of the several fissures. The white matter Ues in the interior of the organ, and extends into the core of each lameUa. When a vertical section is made through the organ, the prolongations of white matter branching off into the interior of the several lameUse give to the section an arborescent appearance, known by the fanciful name of arhor vitm (Fig. 83). Independent masses of grey matter are, however, found in the interior of the cerebeUum. If the hemisphere be cut through a little to the outer side of the median lobe, a zig-zag arrange- ment of grey matter, similar in appearance and structure to the nucleus of the oUvary body in the meduUa oblongata, and known as the corpus dentatum of the cerebeUum, is seen; it Ues in the midst of the white core of the hemi- sphere, and encloses white fibres, which leave the interior of the 'corpus at its inner and lower side. StiUing has de- scribed in connection with the anterior end of the m- ferior vermiform process, which projects forwards into the valve of Vieussens, and aids in the formation of the roof of the 4th ventricle, two grey masses, named roof nuclei. They possess flask-shaped nerve cells Uke those of the corpus dentatum.

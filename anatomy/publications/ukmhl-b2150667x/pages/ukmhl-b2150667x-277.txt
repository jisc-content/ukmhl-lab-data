261 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. of grey matter described in connection witli the medulla oblongata. Its epithelial lining is continuous with, that of the central canal. Magendie many years ago pointed out that the cavity of the 4th ventricle communicated below- through a small orifice with the sub-arachnoid space. Key and Eetzius have recently described two additional com- munications, one on each side of the anterior part of the floor of the ventricle. Through these openings vascular folds of the pia mater, named the choroid plexuses of the 4th ventricle, enter its cavity. CEEEBEUM. The Cerebrum or Great Brain lies above the plane of the tentorium, and forms much the largest division of the encephalon. It is customary in human anatomy to include under the name of cerebrum, not only the convo- lutions, the corpora striata, and the optic thalami, developed in the anterior cerebral vesicle, but also the corpora quadri- gemina and crura cerebri developed in the middle cerebral vesicle. The cerebrum is ovoid in shape, and presents superiorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly a deep median longitv. dinal fissure, which subdivides it into two hemispheres. Inferiorly there is a continuity of structure between the two hemispheres across the mesial plane, and if the two hemispheres be drawn asunder by opening out the longi- tudinal fissure, a broad white band, the ccrrious callosum, may be seen at the bottom of that fissure passing across the mesial plane from one hemisphere to the other. The outer surface of each hemisphere is convex, and adapted in shape to the concavity of the inner table of the cranial bones.

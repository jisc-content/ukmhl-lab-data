TEETH. 753 regarded as the sheath of the dentine tube; for each tube is beUeved to have a definite waU, not formed of the matrix substance, though coalesced with it. By many observers the sheath is regarded as a calcified membranous tube. If the dentine be exammed in a fresh tooth, the tubes wiU be seen to be occupied by soft delicate, thread- like prolongations of the pulp. The passage of pro- cesses of the pulp into the dentine tubes was first seen by Owen in the examination of the tusk of an ele- phant ; but the soft contents of the dentine tubes have been made the subject of special investigation by J. Tomes in the human and other mammalian teeth, and have been named the dentinal fibrils. Sharpey has pointed out that the dentine possesses a laminated structure; the lamellae being arranged parallel to the wall of the pulp cavity. This laminated arrangement indicates the mode of formation of the dentine, as will be described on p. 762. In sections through the dentine of dried teeth, it is not uncommon to find, near its periphery, irregular, black spaces containing air. These spaces freely communicate with each other. As the dentine which forms their boun- dary has not unfrequently the appearance of globular con- tours, they were named by Czermak the interglobular spaces. In a fresh tooth they are not empty, but are occupied by a soft part of the matrix, which is traversed in the usual manner by the dentine tubes. This matrix is apparently imperfectly calcified dentine, which shrinks up in a dried tooth, and occasions an air containing space. A layer of small irregular spaces situated in the peripheral part of the dentine in the fang, immediately under the

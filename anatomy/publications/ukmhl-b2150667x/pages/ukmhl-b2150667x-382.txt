The canals are bent, forming nearly §ds of a circle, and would have had six openings into the vestibule had not the contiguous ends of the superior and posterior blended together to open by a common orifice. The opposite end of each of these canals and the outer end of the external canal dilate close to the vestibule to twice their usual diameter, and form an ampulla. The osseous vestibule and semicircular canals are Kned by a periosteum invested by a tessellated epithelium, and con- tain a little fluid, the penlymph. In this fluid the membranous labyrinth is suspended. The membranous vestibide is formed of two smaU sac-bke dila- tations, the walls of which are directly continuous with each other, though the cavities are separated by an intermediate partition. The upper and posterior dilatation, named utriculus, is larger than the lower and anterior, named sacculus. The sacculus is continu- ous with the ductus cochlearis of the membranous cochlea, and both sacculus and utriculus communicate by slender tubes with a short diverticulum lodged in the aqueductus vestibuli, to which the name of ductus vestibuli may be given (Fig. 1.09). The membranous semicircular canals are about Jd the diameter of the osseous. Their walls are continuous with that of the Fig. 108.—Ending of the Vesti- hviar nei-ve. cl, columnar cells covering the crista acoustica; p, peripheral, and c, central processes of audi- tory cells; n, nerve fibres.

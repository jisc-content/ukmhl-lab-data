300 ANATOMY. Origin, Aerakgement, anb Distribution of the Encephalic Nerves. Several pairs of nerves, called Cranial or Encephalic, arise from the under surface or base of the encephalon and pass outwards through foramina situated in the floor of the cranial cavity. Continental anatomists usually enumerate twelve pairs of cranial nerves; but because in one locality two of these nerves lie together and pass through the same foramen, and in another spot three of these nerves emerge together from the skvdl, British anatomists have restricted the number to nine pairs. These nerves are numbered from before backwards, in the order in which they are seen at the base of the brain. The names applied to the individual nerves, and their numerical designations, according to both the Continental and British methods, are given in the following table :— Continental. British. Olfactory Nerves, 1st pair 1st pair Optic Nei-ves, 2d ,, 2d ,, Oculo-motor Nerves 3rd ,, 3rd ,, Trochlear Nei-ves, 4th ,, 4th „ Trifacial or Trigeminal Nerves,... 5th ,, 5th „ Abducent Nerves, 6th ,, 6th ,, Facial Nerves (Portio dura), 7th ,, ) 7th ,, Auditory Nerves (Portio moUis), 8th Glosso-pharyngeal Nerves, 9th J Pneumogastric Nerves (Vagus), 10th „ / 8th Spinal Accessory Nei-ves, Hth „ ) Hypoglossal Nerves, 12th ,, 9th These nerves may be arranged in three groups accord- ing to the presence or absence of motor and sensory fibres.

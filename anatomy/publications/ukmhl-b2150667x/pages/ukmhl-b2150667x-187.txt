OSSEOUS TISSUE. 171 Spaces or canals now form in the ossifying cartilage, into wMch blood-vessels, continuous with the vessels of the perichondrium, are prolonged. These spaces are lined by concentric layers of small rounded cells, not unlike lym- phoid cells in size and aj^pearance, and form the medullary spaces of foetal cartilage, whilst the cells and blood-vessels form the medulla. Eespecting the source of origin of the cells of this medulla, there have been difficulties in arriving at a correct conclusion. Some have believed them to be descended from the cartUage cells, though no demonstration of their derivation from this source has ever been obtained. Henke conceived that they might be blood corpuscles migrated from the blood-vessels within the spaces. But the recent observations of Stieda seem satisfactorily to show that the layers of medulla cells are continuous with similar layers beneath the perichondrium, which layers are prolonged along with the blood-vessels into the medullary spaces as they form in the ossifying cartil- age. But, whatever be their derivation, there can be no doubt that these cells undergo certain modifications which are of the utmost importance in the further stages of the ossific process. A few become elongated into fusiform or stellate corpuscles, like those of connective tissue; others have oil drops forming in their interior, and become the cells of yellow marrow; others become the many-nucleated cells of red marrow ; others, again, which form the osteo- blasts properly so-caUed, are the direct agents in the pro- duction of the osseous tissue itself. The formation of the medullary spaces in cartilage is owing to an absorption of the calcified cartilaginous tissue. KoUiker points out that the absorption is efi"ected through

JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”LOWEK LIMB. 103 tendon of these muscles (Fig. 18). The knee can be bent so that the calf can touch the back of the thigh, and in this position the patella is drawn down in front of the joint, as in kneeling. The articular surface of the patella is divided into seven areas or facets, and in passing from the bent to the extended position of the joint, these facets come successively into contact with the articular surface of the femur, until, when the leg is fuUy extended on the thigh, the whole of the patella is raised above the femoral trochlea, except the lowest pair of narrow facets. It is in order to provide a smooth surface for the patella in this position that the synovial membrane of the joint covers the front of the lower end of the femur, and the membrane is drawn upwards by the action of the small sub-crurseus muscle. At the commencement of flexion a slight rotation inwards of the leg and foot takes place through the action of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, which are inserted close together into the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia; whilst the extensor muscles cause, at the com- pletion of extension, a slight rotation outwards of the leg and foot. The movements of flexion and extension are not simply in the antero-posterior plane, but along oblique paths, which are determined by the screwed configuration of the femoral condyles. In complete extension of the leg the joint is "screwed home j" and as this position is necessary for the preservation of the erect attitude, the lateral, the posterior, and the anterior crucial ligaments are then all tense, to prevent displacement of the bo \es. The muscles which rotate the leg and foot inwards initiate the act of flexion by unlocking the joint. The Tihio-fihiilar Joints between the upper and lower

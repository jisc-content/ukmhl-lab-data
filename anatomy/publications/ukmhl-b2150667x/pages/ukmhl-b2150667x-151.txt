EPITHELIUM. 135 longer and stronger. Sometimes, as in the lining mem- brane of the cerebral ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord, the cells carrying the cilia are either spheroidal or cylindrical. Cilia occasion currents in the fluid in which they move, and play an important part in the economy of many animals; in some of the invertebrata they serve as organs of locomotion, in others they propel currents over respiratory surfaces, and in others aid in bringing food within the animal's reach. Spheroidal or glandular epithelium is situated on the free surface of the foUicles or ultimate secreting apparatus of glands, and the commencement of gland ducts. The cells are often spheroidal in form, though not unfrequently they are polyhedral. Theircontentsarespeciallydifferentiated into the secretion of the particular gland in which they are situated. The epithelial cells of a Secreting Gland rest upon a sub- epithelial tissue. Not unfrequently this tissue has the appearance of a membrane; it represents, indeed, the basement membrane of Bowman, and is called memhrana propria. Deeper .■1 , .

The anatomical struc- tures necessary for secretion are cells, blood-vessels, lymph- vessels, and nerves. The blood-vessels convey the blood from which the secretion has to be derived ; the ceUs, as Goodsir showed by a variety of proofs, are the active agents in separating the secretion from the blood; the

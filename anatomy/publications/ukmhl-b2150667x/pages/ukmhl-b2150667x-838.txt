ANATOMY. 822 name septum pectiniforme applied to it. From the inner surface of the external coat and from the septum numerous bands, or trabeculse, arise, which intersect in various direc- tions ; they subdivide the space enclosed by the fibrous coat into numbers of small compartments, which are lined by an endothelium, continuous with that of the venous vascular system, and form a cavernous arrangement of veins. The trabeculaB are composed not only of fibro- elastic tissue, but of non-striped muscle, which is also pro- longed over the inner surface of the tunica albuginea. The compartments between the trabeculse freely communi- cate with each other in the same corpus cavernosum, and also through the slits in the septum with those in the opposite cavernous body. The corpora cavernosa are supplied with blood by the cavernous branches of the two pubic arteries, which enter the crura penis, and by branches of the dorsal artery of the penis, which pierce the fibrous coat. They branch and run along the trabeculse. They may terminate either in capillaries, or in the peculiar curling twigs de- scribed by J. Miiller as the helidne arteries. The capil- laries open directly into the venous intertrabecular spaces. The helicine arteries are chiefly found in the crura penis, and are apparently small convoluted arteries, which may end either in capillaries, or may form a blind termination. The veins of the corpora cavernosa arise from the cavernous venous spaces, by the distension of which with blood the erection of the penis is produced. The veins join to form not only the dorsal vein of the penis, but likewise the veins which accompany the cavernous arteries. The corpus spongiosum penis is the part of the organ

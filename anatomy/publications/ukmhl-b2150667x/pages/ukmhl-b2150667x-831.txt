815 PKOSTATE GLAND. muscular tissue is both non-striped and striped. The non- striped muscle forms a portion of the anterior part of the gland in front of the urethra, as well as a considerable proportion of the base of the organ, where it is continuons with the sphincter vesicae muscle. It forms a ring-like sphincter arrangement around the commencement of the urethra, by the division of which, in the lateral operation of lithotomy, the urethra and prostate can be dilated so as more readily to admit the forceps into the bladder. The striped muscle of the prostate has been especially described by Kohlrausch and Henle. It is best seen at the apex of the prostate, where it is directly continous with the striped fibres of the constrictor urethras muscle which surround the membranous part of the urethra. It sur- rounds the urethra at the apex of the prostate, and doubt- less acts as a sphincter muscle for it, so that Kohlrausch has named it sphincter uretrce prostaticus. Fasciculi con- tinuous with this muscle also pass backwards as far as the sides of the neck of the bladder. The glandular substance of the prostate consists of short branching acinous glands, which unite into a number of excretory ducts, that for the most part open on the floor of the urethra on each side of the coUiculus seminalis. Both the ducts and the acini are lined by a columnar epithelium. Concretions are apt to form in old men in the ducts of these glands. The prostate is penetrated by the urethra, the common ejaculatory ducts, and the prostatic vesicle. The prostatic part of the urethra is the dilated com- mencement of that tube. It is about 1^ inch long, is continuous behind with the bladder, and in front with

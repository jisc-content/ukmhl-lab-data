619 THE PLEUE/E. phatic vessels form plexuses in the mucous and submucous coats. Fine nerves, derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic, are distributed to it, in connection with which microscopic ganglia have been seen. The Pleue^. Each lung is situated in, and occupies the greater part of, one lateral half of the cavity of the thorax. It is in- vested by a serous membrane, the Pleura; and the wall of the chest,bounding the space in which the lung is contained, is lined by a prolongation of the same serous membrane. Like the serous membranes elsewhere, the pleura consists, therefore, of a visceral part investing the organ, and a parietal ijari lining the wall of the cavity in which the organ is lodged. The pleural investment of the lung is called the pulmonic pleura. The pleural lining of the cavity has different names applied to different portions of its ex- tent. That which lines the inner surface of the ribs, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, is the costal pleura; that which covers the upper surface of the diaphragm is the diaphragmatic pleura: that which is prolonged for one inch, or rather more, above the level of the first rib into the root of the neck, is the cervical pleura ; that which covers the lateral surface of the pericardium, and forms the lateral boundary of the mediastinum, is the mediastinal pleura ; whilst a fold of the pleura, prolonged downwards from the root of the lung to the diaphragm, forms the broad ligament of the lung, ligamentum latum pulmonis. These several terms simply express topographical divisions of one and the same membrane : thus the pleura costalis

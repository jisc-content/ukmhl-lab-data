358 ANATOMY. The EjlR. The Eak, or organ of hearing, is a complex aeonstic ap- paratus, situated in connection witli the temporal bone. It is divided into three parts, named externa?, middle, and internal ear. EXTEKNAI. EAK. The JExtemal Ear consists of the pinna or auricle and the external auditory meatus. The cmricle is the oblong convoluted body situated at the side of the head. Its incurved outer border is named the Jielix. Within this lies a curved ridge, the anti-helix, in front of which is a deep hollow, the concha, which leads into the external meatus. The concha is bounded in front by a prominence, the iragtcs, and behind by a smaller prominence, the anti-tragus ; below the anti-tragus is the lobnle, which forms the most depending part of the auricle. The framework of the auricle is formed of yellow elastic fibro-cartilage invested by integument, except the lobule, which consists merely of a fold of integument containing fat. Attached to the car- tilage are not only the three auricular muscles referred to on page 83, but also certain smaller muscles called the proper muscles of the pinna. Thus the greater muscle of the helix is placed on its anterior border; the lesser muscle of the helix \s, situated where it arises out of the concha; the muscle of the tragus'm^ on the front of that prominence; the muscle of the anti-tragus is placed on the back of its prominence; the tran^erse muscle on the posterior or cranial surface of the auricle. The External Meatus leads from the bottom of the concha

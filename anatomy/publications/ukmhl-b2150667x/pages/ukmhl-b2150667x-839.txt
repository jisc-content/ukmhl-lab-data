823 PEOTS. whicli contains the urethra, and is situated on the inferior or perineal surface of the penis. It commences behind iu the dilatation called the hulh, from which it passes forwards as a cylindriform body, and terminates in front in the ex- panded structure known as the glans penis. Its bulbous commencement is in contact with the perineal surface of the triangular ligament, and receives an investment from it. The bulb, and the part of the corpus spongiosum im- mediately continuous with it, are invested by the accelerator urinse muscle. The accelerator urince or hulho-cavernosus muscle may either be regarded as a single muscle, the two lateral halves of wldch are united together by a mesial tendinous raphe, or as a pair of muscles. It arises from a point in the perineum, to which the levatores ani and transverse muscles of the perineum converge, also from the mesial tendinous raph6; the greater number of its fibres pass round the bulb and adjacent part of the corpus spon- giosum to the perineal surface of the triangular ligament; but the most anterior fibres run outwards around the side of the corpus cavernosum, either to be inserted into the dorsum penis, or to end in a fibrous layer prolonged over the dorsum. Structure.â€”The corpus spongiosum possesses a fibrous envelope, with trabeculse and with intertrabecular venous compartments, but its coat is thinner, and the compartments are fewer and less distensible than those of the corpora cavernosa. The bulb receives a pair of special arteries, the arteries to the bulb, one from each internal pudic artery, which run forwards in the body of the corpus spon- giosum ; the dorsal arteries of the penis end in the glans

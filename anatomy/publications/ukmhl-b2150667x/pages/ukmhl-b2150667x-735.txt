719 ILEO-CCECAL VALVE. seen ttat the orifice of the ileum is not circular, but elongated in a direction nearly transverse to the long axis of the large intestine. The opening is bounded by two semi-lunar folds, which project into the large bowel. ^ These folds are the two segments of the valve ; one situated above the opening is the ileo-colic segment, the other, below the opening, the ileo- ccecal. The two seg- ments become continu- ous with each other at the ends of the elongated opening, and are pro- longed for some distance around the inner wall of the large intestine as two prominent ridges, named the frcena of the valve. Each segment consists of the mucous and sub- mucous coat, and of the circular layer of the mus- cular coat of the ileum, which are, as it were, pushed into the canal of the large bowel, at the place of junction, so as to form the prominent folds which have been described. The longitudinal muscular layer and the serous coat of the ileum are prolonged Fig. 195.â€”View of the interior of tlie Cfficum and ascending colon, to show the neo-colic valve. 1, Ileum ; 2, ascend- ing colon ; 8, appendix vermiformis ; 4, Ileo-colic segment, and 5, Ileo-crecal segment of valve ; 6, opening of Ueum ; 7, mouth of appendix vermiformis.

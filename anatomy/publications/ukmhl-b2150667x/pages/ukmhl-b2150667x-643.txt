THE LUNGS. 627 upper surface of the diaphragm, aud reaches much lower down behind than in front: the apex is rounded, and reaches into the root of the neck from one inch to one and a lialf inch above the first rib. The external or costal sur- face is much the larger of the two surfaces ; it is convex, and adapted to the curvature of the ribs : the internal or mediastinal surface is concave, and adapted to the convex lateral surface of the pericardium; about the middle of this surface, but much nearer to the posterior than to the anterior border, is situated the root of the lung. The anterior or sternal border is thin, and fits in between the back of the sternum and the front of the pericardium : the posterior or vertebral border is thick and rounded, and occupies the deep hollow at the side of the vertebral bodies; this border possesses a longer vertical diameter than any other part of the lung. The inferior or dia- pJiraffmatic border forms the boundary between the base and the external and internal surfaces of the lung : in the greater part of its extent it fits between the ribs and the costal origins of the diaphragm. On all its aspects the exterior of the lung is in close relation to the parietal pleura, which relation it always preserves in the healthy chest, as it rises in inspiration, or falls in expiration. The con- tact of the lung with the parietal pleura is ensured by the pressure of the column of air in the windpipe and air-cells. Each lung is divided into two lobes by a deep fissure, which, beginning at the posterior border about three inches below the apex, and on a level with the vertebral end of the third rib, extends through its substance, obliquely downwards and forwards, as far as the anterior border, or t'le anterior end of the inferior border. The upper lobe is

699 SMALL INTSSTIiS^E. caUed the hepatico-diiodenal ligament, and its descending and transverse parts are attached to the right kidney and posterior waU of the abdomen by connective tissue. But in addition a suspensory muscle, composed of non-striped fibres, has been described by Treitz as extending from the region of the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery to the transverse part of the duodenum. The duodenum is distinguished from the rest of the smaU intestine by having the ducts of the liver and pancreas opening into its canal, by containing in its wall a collection of compound racemose glands, named the glands of Brunner, and by being developed from the primi- tive fore-gut, and not, like the jejunum and ileum, from the primitive middle gut (p. 774). Like the stomach, it should be regarded as a distinct segment of the alimentary canal. The Jejunum and Ileum form by far the longest part of the small intestine, and are not separated from each other by any sharp line of demarcation : the upper two-fifths being called jejunum, on account of its being usually empty after death, the lower three-fifths being termed ileum, from its convoluted arrangement. They occupy the um- bilical, hypogastric, right and left iliac regions of the abdomen, in which they are arranged in a series of coUs or convolutions ; one or two coUs of the ileum sometimes lie in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum. The coils are attached to the posterior wall of the abdomen, along a line from the body of the first lumbar vertebra to the right sacro-iliac joint, by the fold of peritoneum called the mesentery. Owing to the extent of the mesentery, the coils of the jejunum and ileum can

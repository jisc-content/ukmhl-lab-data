493 STRUCTURE OF ARTERIES. ries, and tlie collateral arteries to each, toe anastomose with each other on the plantar aspect of the terminal phalanx Structure of the Arteries. As a general rule, each artery is surrounded by a sheath, formed of connective tissue, which is attached to the outer wall of the artery by slender fibres, and the attachment is so loose, that when the artery is cut across it retracts within its sheath. The wall of the artery consists of several coats, wbich are distinguished from each otber not only by differences in the direction of the fibres of which they are composed, but by structural differences. Soma Fig. 132 —D agram of the Structure of an Artery. A, tunica adventitia; E elastic layer; M, muacular coat; F, fenestrated layer; En, endothelium con- tinuous with the endothelial wall of C, the capillaries. anatomists name these coats outer, middle, and inner, but others apply to them the names of fibrous coat, elastic coat, muscular coat, fenestrated coat, and endothelial coat, a nomenclature based on their structural characters.

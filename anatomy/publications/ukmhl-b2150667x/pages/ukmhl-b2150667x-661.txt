645 ALIMENTARY CANAL. a series of segments, or compartments, wMck communi- cate with each other, from above downwards, in the longi- tudinal axis of the canal. These compartments are named mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intes- tine (subdivided into duodenum, jejunum, and Ueum), and large intestine (subdivided into ccecum, colon, and rectum). The canal is lined by a mucous membrane, called the alimentary mucous membrane, which is continu- ous with the nasal mucous membrane, with the respiratory mucous membrane, and at the anal and oral orifices with the integument. Outside this mucous membrane is the submucous coat, and external to it is the muscular wall of the canaL By the contraction of the muscular wall the food is propelled along the canal from above downwards. Opening on the surface of the mucous membrane are the orifices of the ducts of numerous glands, the secretions of which mingling with the food, act chemically on it, so as to render it soluble and capable of being absorbed. 9

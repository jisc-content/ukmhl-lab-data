601 MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF LARYNX. Arytenoid muscle, wtich arises from the posterior con- cave surface of one arytenoid cartilage, passes transversely across the mesial plane, to be inserted into the correspond- iug surface of the other cartilage. The epiglottis is drawn backwards and depressed by the pair of oblique aryteno-epiglottidei, and the thyro- epiglot- tidei muscles. The Obligate aryteno-epiglottidei muscles consist of the oblique fibres situated superficial to the arytenoid muscle. They arise near the external or muscular tubercle at the base of the arytenoid, pass obliquely upwards across the mesial plane to the apex of the opposite ary- tenoid cartilage, and then ascend in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane. The ob- lique aryteno-epiglottidean and arytenoid muscles are arranged around the superior orifice of the larynx like a sphincter, and by their contraction the size of this opeuing is diminished. Thyro-epiglottidei consist of fibres which arise from the innar surface of the thyroid cartilage near the retreating angle, and ascend to the side of the epiglottis. The glottis is shut, during the act of swallowing, not only by the depression of the epiglottis, as described on p. 89, but by the closure of the rima glottidis, due to the approxi- mation of the arytenoid cartilages and the true vocal cords. 2q Fig. 107.â€”The posterior muscles of tlie Larynx, a, hyoid bone; 6, thyro-hyoid ligament ; c, thyroid cartilage; d, cricoid cartilage; e, e, arytenoid carti- lages; /, epiglottis; oblique aryteno-epiglottidean muscles; h, posterior crico-arytenold muscle.

182 ANATOMY. a muscular fibre has a disposition to split up transversely or longitudinally into smaller particles. The transverse subdivision of the fibre is promoted by digesting a piece of muscle for some hours in dilute hydrochloric acid. If the fibres be then examined, gaps or fissures will be seen to extend transversely into the substance of the fibre; and, if the digestion has been suflaciently pro- longed, the fissures have extended com- pletely across the fibre, and have sub- Fio. 60.—A muscu- (divided it into a midtitude of plate or lar fibre cleaving transversely disc-shaped bodies — the muscular-jiore discs. These discs are the strongly and feebly refracting discs akeady described, and the trans- verse diameter of each disc corresponds to that of the fibre from which it has been derived. The longitudinal marks in the fibre are best seen by digest- ing a piece of muscle in strong spirit of wine, or in a solution of chromic acid. If a fibre so treated be teased out with needles, and the thin covering glass be smartly tapped, the fibre wiU spUt up longitudinaUy into multitudes of minute, elongated threads—the mmcular-fihre fib- rillce. A fibrilla may be regarded as equalling in length the fibre of which it ''far'fl^^e'' ciCing formed a part, and like the fibre is trans- S.'^^"'versely striped; but its breadth is not definite, and depends upon the minuteness with .^ch the fibre has been spUt up in the longitudmal direction.

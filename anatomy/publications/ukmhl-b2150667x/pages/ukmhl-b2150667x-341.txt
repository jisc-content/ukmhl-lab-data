325 THE NOSE. glands contain roundish secreting cells with yellowish- brown pigment-stained contents. The epithelium is cylin- drical, but not usually ciliated, though patches „p-- of ciliated epithelium cells are said to occur in man. Long, slender, and even branched processes proceed from the deeper end of each cell towards or even into the sub-epi- thelial connective tissue. The cells usually contain pigment granules. Between the epithe- lium cells the characteristic olfactory cells of Schultze are situated. Each olfactory cell (Fig. 96) consists of a globular or fusiform body, from which two long processes arise : one, the pmj^/ieraZ process, passes vertically between the adjacent cyHndrical epithelium cells to the free surface of the mucous membrane: in amphibia, reptiles, and birds it projects beyond the plane ^thVough^^'^'the of the epithelium as a simple hair-hke struc- coiis^""^^niem- , T . brane. e, epi- ture, or subdivided mto several slender " oZ/cic- tueiium ceii; J . , . 0, olfactory toryJmirs;' m fish and mammals, man in- cell; c, its peri- pheral ; and p, elusive, it ends, without forming a hair-like ^'^ central va- ° ricose process prolongation, on the general plane of the WterSchuUze. mucous surface. The second or central process of the olfac- tory cell extends towards the sub-epithelial connective tissue : it is finer than the peripheral process, and has not unfrequently a varicose appearance like a nerve fibre. In the description of the development of the brain (p. 214), the origin of the olfactory bulb and peduncle from the hemisphere vesicle was referred to. In the adult brain the olfactory peduncle is in contact with the under surface of the frontal lobe (Fig. 94). It is a white band, which divides

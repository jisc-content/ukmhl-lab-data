The lettering as in Fig. 6, with, in addition, BO, basi-occipital; EO, ex-occipital^ PT petions-temporal; BS, basi-sphenoid; PS, pre-splienoid (the letters are placed In the sphenoidal sinus); OS, orbito-spheiioid; ME, mes-ethmoid; SO, septa caitilage of nose; V, vomer; PI, palate; Pt, pterygoid of sphenoid; A frontal sinus; Â«, pituitary fossa; fm, foramen magnum; a, angle; and s, symphysis of lower jaw.

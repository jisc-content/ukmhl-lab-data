64 ANATOMY. which prevails in the bones of the head. In old persons the sutures become obliterated by the ossification of the intermediate fibrous membrane, and the bones are per- manently fused together. The cranial sutures may conveniently be arranged in three groups : _ i,, , «, Median longitudinal, consist- FiG. 13.—Vertical section tnrougli ' o ' borsT:!:ro"teth'e'sutre;7i°g ^0^*^! ^^^^^e, which o7"a^°°gament,'' and"which"'is frontal bouc, and the sagittal continuous with the interposed . ■, , j_ ■ j. i fibrous membrane. suture, between the two parietal bones; b, Lateral longitudinal, consisting, on each side of the head, of the fronto-nasal, fronto-maxillary, fronto-lachrymal, fronto-ethmoidal, fronto-malar, fronto- sphenoidal, parieto-sphenoidal, parieto-squamous, parieto- mastoid sutures; c, Vertical transverse, consisting of the coronal or fronto-parietal, the lambdoidal or parieto-occi- pital, the sphenoido-malar, sphenoido-squamous and occi- pito-mastoid sutures (fig. 6). As the skull grows by ossifica- tion of the cartilage of the base and the membranous vault, the direction of growth is perpendicular to the margins of the bones and the sutures and synchondroses which connect them together. The growth of the skuU in length is per- pendicular, therefore, to the basi-cranial synchondrosis and the vertical transverse group of sutures; its growth, in breadth, to the median longitudinal group, and in height to the lateral longitudinal group. So long as any of the cartilage or membrane between the margins of the bones remains unossified, bone may continue to form, and the skuU may increase in size. It sometimes happens that the cartilao-e or membrane is prematurely ossified in

The rods and cones are the peripheral end-organs in connection with the fibres of the optic nerve, and their apparent relation to these fibres is as follows :— The optic nerve fibres are continuous with the central pr()- cesses of the ganglion cells of the retina, the peripheral branching processes of which pass into the internal granu- lated layer, where they may possibly become continuous with the central processes of the inner granular layer. The peri- pheral processes of the inner granular layer enter the external granulated layer, but it is difficult to say whether or not they become continuous with the central processes of that layer. There can, however, be no doubt that the peripheral processes of this layer are directly continuous with the rods and cones of the bacillary layer. The entire arrangement is sometimes called the radial nervous fibres of the retina. In addition to the nervous structures just described, the retina contains a delicate supporting connective tissue like

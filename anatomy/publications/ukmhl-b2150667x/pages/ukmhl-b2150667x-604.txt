588 ANATOMY. Cartilages of the Larynx. The cartilages of the larynx are nine in number, and form its framework. They consist of three single cartilages, the thyroid, the cricoid, and the epiglottis; and of three pairs of car- tilages, the two ary- tenoid, the two corni- cula laryngis, and the two cuneiform carti- lages. The Thyeoid, or shield-like cartilage, is the largest of the car- tilages of the larynx, It is situated anteriorly, and laterally, and con- sists of two quadri- lateral plates or al<x, which are united to- gether by their anterior borders, where they form, especially in the neck of a man, a project- ing angle, or prominence in the middle line of the front of the neck, fami- liarly known as Adam's apple, 2^omum Adaini From this border of union the plates project Fia. 161.â€”Cartilages of the Larynx seen from behind.

ANATOm'. 118 organisms, however different, and that tliis principle is the formation of cells." The ovtim is the primordial or fundamental cell, or germ-cell, from which, after being fertilised by the male sperm, the tissues and organs of the animal body are derived. Within the fertilised ovum multiplication of cells takes place with great rapidity. It is as yet an unsettled question how far the original nucleus of the ovum participates in this process of multiplication; but there can be no doubt that the protoplasm cell contents divide, first into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen segments, and so on in midtiple proportion. Each of these segments of protoplasm con- tains a nucleus—is, in short, a nucleated cell, and the protoplasm of these cells exhibits the property of con- tractility. The ovum or germ-cell is therefore the imme- diate parent of aU the new cells which are formed within it, and mediately it is the parent of all the cells which, in the subsequent processes of development and growth, are descended from those produced by the segmentation of the yelk. The process of development of young cells within a parent cell, whether it occurs in the ovum or in a cell derived by descent from the ovum, is called the endogenous reproduction of cells. But cells may multiply by a process of fission—i.e., a constriction, gradually deep- ening, may take place in a cell until it is subdivided into two; the nucleus at the same time participating in the constriction and subdivision. A third mode of multipli- cation of ceUs is by budding: little clumps of protoplasm bud out from the protoplasm of the parent cell, become detached, and assume an independent vitality. K a nucleus differentiates in the interior of such a climip, it

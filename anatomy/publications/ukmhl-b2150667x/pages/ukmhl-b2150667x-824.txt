ANATOMY, 808 vessels. When these are torn down by dissecting with needles under water or spirit, the tubes may be untwisted and seen to have an average length of 2^ feet, and a diameter of from xiiTth to -^-cTj-th of an inch. The tubes begin either with blind ends or anastomosing loops. They become straighter as they approach the mediasti- num, where they join and form ""the vasa recta, about twenty in number, which possess an average diameter of about g^th of an inch. When within the mediastinum the straight tubes unite to form a network, the rete testis. From the rete testis from twelve to twenty tubes arise, which pierce the tunica albuginea, at the upper end of the testicle under cover of the head of the epididymis, and form the vasa efferentia. As in each vas efferens the tube again becomes convoluted, and forms a conical mass, the name c07ii vasculosi has been applied to the series of vasa efferentia. The length of the convoluted vaa efferens in each conus is, when unravelled, about seven inches. The several vasa efferentia unite together to form the epididymis ; the tube of which is coUed upon itself to form the globus major, body and globus minor of that canal. From the tube in the globus minor the vas deferens arises. The length of the tube of the epididymis, when unravelled, is about twenty feet, and its diameter varies from about ^th to -^th inch. The tubuli seminiferi, within the lobes of the testis, have a wall, or membrana propria, formed of layers of polygonal, nucleated, flattened ceUs. Outside this wall is a very delicate areolar tissue, in which is situated, not only the network of blood capillaries surrounding the seminal tubes, but the lymph-spaces and lymph capillaries

229 SPINAL COED, wldcli it forms some of the vertical fibres. These fibres may ascend to the brain, or they may at some higher point in the cord enter the grey matter of the posterior horn. The other bundle of posterior root fibres at once enters the posterior horn of grey matter. The connections and ulti- mate arrangement of these fibres in the grey matter have not been satisfactorily made out. Gerlach states that, as they frequently subdivide on entering the grey matter, it is possible they may form the fine nerve fibre plexus of the grey substance; but a direct continuity between them and the axial cylinder processes of the cells of the posterior horn does not seem to have been observed. From the plexus, formed by the much subdivided processes of these cells, fibres arise, which, forming the fibres of the pos- terior commissure, pass both in front of and behind the central canal to the opposite side, where they ascend towards the brain, " partly in the vertical fasciculi of the posterior comua and partly in the posterior columns." The structure of the spinal cord shows it to be both a nerve centre and a conductor of nervous impulses. The nerve ceUs in its grey matter give rise either directly, or through the dehcate plexus formed by their branching processes, to nerve fibres, which may either pass out of the cord as the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, or may ascend to the brain as the columns of the cord. Hence the cord is anatomically continuous, on the one hand, through the nerves which arise from it, with the peripheral end-organs in the skin, and muscular system in which those nerves terminate; and, on the other hand, it is continuous with the brain. It serves, therefore, to conduct the impulses of touch-sensation from the skin upwards

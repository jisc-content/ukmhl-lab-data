INTERNAL STKUCTUEE OF THE CEEEBKUM. 287 The grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina consists of two distinct masses. One, the peripheral layer, lies near the surface, and contains numerous small multipolar nerve cells; the other, the Sylvian or central layer, surrounds the Sylvian fissure and belongs to the grey matter of the wall of the cerebro-spinal tube, and serves as a centre of origin for the roots of both the 3d and 4th cranial nerves. The grey matter of the crus cerebri occupies the centre of the cerebral peduncle. Its cells are multipolar, and con- tain dark brown or black pigment, so that the name locus niger is applied to this collection of nerve cells. c. The central grey matter of the cerebrum is in series with the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle and the grey matter of the spinal cord. It is situated around the Sylvian aqueduct, and at the sides and floor of the third ventricle, which form the cerebral portion of the cerebro- spinal tube. That which surrounds the aqueduct of Sylvius forms the Sylvian or central layer in the corpora quad- rigemina, above referred to. It contains numerous weU- maAed multipolar nerve ceUs, which are largest and most distinct below the aqueduct, where they form weU-defined groups. But further, a remarkable zone-like arrangement of nerve cells Hes at the circumference of the sides and upper part of the central mass of grey matter (Fig. 93). In vertical transverse sections these cells may be seen to He some- times singly, but more usually in groups of two or three, or up to six ceUs. The ceUs are twice, or even three times as large as the multipolar nerve cells of the central mass. The body of the ceU is often globular in form, and from it one or two processes arise. The cells lie in a tract of well- defined nerve fibres, to which they have apparently the same

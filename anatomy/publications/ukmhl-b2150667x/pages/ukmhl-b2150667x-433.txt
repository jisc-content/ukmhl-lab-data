AOETIC GROUP OF AETERIES. 417 and shrivels up into a fibrous cord. The distribution of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs will be afterwards de- scribed. AOBTIC OK SYSTEMIC GROUP OF AETEEIES. This group consists of the aorta and of the branches, which arise either directly or indirectly from it. The AORTA is the great systemic arterial trunk, and lies in the cavities of the thorax and abdomen. It arises from the base of the left ventricle of the heart, and forms above the root of the left lung an arch, the arch of the aorta; it then descends in close relation to the thoracic spine, as the descending thoracic aorta ; it next passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, enters the cavity of the abdomen, and becomes the abdominal aorta. In the abdomen it descends in front of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae as low as the fourth, where it is usually described as dividing into the two terminal branches, the common iliac arteries. At the angle of bifurcation, however,, a long slender artery, called the middle sacral, is prolonged downwards in front of the sacrum to the end of the coccyx. In animals with long tails this artery can be recognised as a direct con- tinuation of the aorta, prolonging it downwards in front of the caudal vertebra, whilst the iliacs are seen to be colla. teral branches; but in man, where the coccyx is rudimen- tary, and the lower limbs largely developed, the iliac arte- ries, which supply those limbs, are so big as to obscure the true signification of the middle sacral artery, and appear themselves to be the terminal branches of the aorta. The Arch of the Aorta springs from the base of the left ventricle on a level with the third pair of intercostal spaces

The Left Auricle is situated at the posterior and left part of the base of the heart, and, like the right auricle, consists of a dilated sinus venosus and an ear-shaped appendage,*the auricula. Its muscular wall has a smooth surface internally, except in the auricula, where the comb- like musculi pectinati occur. Opening into the posterior part of the sinus venosus are the orifices of the four jow^ monary veins, two from the right, two from the left lung; these orifices are without valves. At the lower part of the auricle is the large left auriculo-ventriait,lar orifice of com- munication between it and the base of the left ventricle. The auricular septum is marked by a slight depression, which indicates the position of the foramen ovale in the foetal heart. The auricular appendix is somewhat longer than on the right side, and curves forward by the side of the pulmonary artery. The Left or Posterior Ventricle forms the left border, the apex, a large part of the posterior surface, but only a small part of the anterior surface of the heart. It is conical in form, its apex is at the apex of the heart, the base at the corresponding auricle. As in the right ventricle, the inner surface of its wall is elevated into fleshy columns, two of which project Uke nipples into the cavity and form large musculi papillares, which have chorda} tendinem con- nected with them. The left auriculo-ventricular opening, situated at the base of the ventricle, is large enough to admit two fingers. It possesses a valve, which consists of two large pointed segments or cusps, hence it is caUed the

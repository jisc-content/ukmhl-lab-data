833 OVAI^Y. it penetrates between and around the spherical cor- puscles, and separates them from the columnar corpuscles on the' outer surface and in the involuted germ epithe- lium. Collections of these spherical cells then become enclosed in the substance of the stroma of the ovary, and form the egg-chains and egg-clusters described by Pfiuger and Waldeyer. As the examination of the developing ovary is made by means of vertical sections into its substance, the egg-chains appear as if enclosed in tubes, and have led to Fig. 229—Vertical section through the OvaiT of the HumanfoetTis. g, <7, germ epithelium, with o, o, developing ova in it; s, i, ovarian stroma, containing c, c, c, fusifoiTn connective tissue corpuscles; v, d, capillary tlood-vessels.

But, from Foulis's observations, it would appear that these so- called tubes are produced by sections through furrows and depressions between irregular prominences on the surface of the ovary, which prominences are owing to the ex- pansion of egg-clusters situated under the germ epithe" 5

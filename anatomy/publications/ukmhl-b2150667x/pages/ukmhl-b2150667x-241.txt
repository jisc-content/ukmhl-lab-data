SPINAL COED. 225 is separated by a fissure into the small internal postero- median column, or bandofGoll and the funiculus cuneatus. The subdivision of each lateral half of the cord into the columns, and the arrangement of its nervous tissues, are well seen in transverse sections through its sub- stance (Fig. 72). The cord is composed of white and grey matter. The white matter is external, and forms the columns of the cord. The grey matter is surrounded by the white, and has in each lateral half of the cord a crescentic shape. The horns of the crescent are directed towards the fissures of emergence of the nerve roots; the anterior horn is rounded; the posterior long and narrow. The proportion of grey matter to the white varies in dif- ferent parts of the cord. At the commencement of the filum terminale there is scarcely any white matter; but the white matter increases in amount from below up- wards, so that its absolute quantity is greatest in the cervi- cal part of the cord. The grey crescents are thicker in the upper and lower enlargements than in the intermediate part. The cord contains both nerve fibres and nerve cells. The external, columnar, white part of the cord consists of nerve fibres, with a supporting reticular framework of connective tissue and blood-vessels derived from the pia mater. Well- formed stellate connective tissue corpuscles lie in this sup- porting framework. The nerve fibres of the various columns extend longitudinally, and lie paraUel to each other, so that in transverse sections through the columns the fibres are transversely divided. The individual fibres vary much in diameter, but in aU the axial cylinder and meduUary sheath can be distinctly seen. Wherever the nerve roots enter P

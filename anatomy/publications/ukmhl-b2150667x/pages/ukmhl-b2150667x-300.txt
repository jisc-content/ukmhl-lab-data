284 ANATOMY. to tlie large pyramidal cells numerous small, irregularly shaped nerve corpuscles, like those of the internal granule layer of the retina, form the so-calledgrantde layer oi the grey matter. Fusiform cells, which give off lateral processes, are found in the deepest layer of the grey matter, and form the claustral layer of Meynert. Gerlach has described here, as in the spinal cord, a network of extremely minute nerve iibres, with which the branched lateral processes of the nerve cells are apparently continuous. The neuroglia con- tains multitudes of small rounded corpuscles. In it also are found small stellate cells, provided with minute branched processes, which ceUs, as Meynert states, are so pellucid, that in the healthy brain they seem to be only free nuclei; it is difficult to say whether these cells belong to the neurogUa, or are nerve cell elements. The grey cortex of the cerebrum is about five times as vascular as the white matter. The arteries derived from the pia mater pass ver- tically into the grey matter. Some terminate in a rich capiUary plexus within the grey matter. Other vessels of larger size, after giving off small branches,'which join the capillary plexus of the grey matter, pass into the white matter, where they are continuous with a much more scanty capillary plexus than is found in the grey matter. In the grey matter of the cortex of the occipital lobe eight layers have been described by Clarke and Meynert. The increase in number is due to the intercalation of two additional granule layers, which coalesce and form a dis- tinct white band in the grey matter, owing, as Meynert states, to the absence of pigment in the ceUs of the granule layers. The grey matter of the cortex of the island of Reil and

A.NATOMY. 350 Huschke and others have described a layer of epithelial cells as present on the surface of the hyaloid membrane. u.-^ Almost opposite the ora serrata a mem- ^l^^^i brane springs from the vitreous body, ^iS^XM^ passes forwards for some distance in ^^^^k^^^i^lr-^te relation to the deep surface of the ■^^Cm ciliary processes, but separated from them by the pars cUiaris retinae, and ^'cei^s'tiTuiis figure are ^^^^ inclines in Wards to become attached from the surface of the . j.r . • c e 2^ i hyaloid membrane.

Ewart.) it IS SO closoly connected at its origin with the membrana Hmitans that it is difficult to recognise it as a distinct membrane. It is named the suspensory ligament of the lens, or zonule of Zinn, and contains fibres, which run in the meridional direction. Where it leaves the vitreous body a narrow space is enclosed between it and that body, which space surrounds the circumference of the lens, and is called the canal of Petit. From the relation of the suspensory ligament to the cUiary processes it has a plicated surface, and when these processes are torn away from it a portion of the pigment of the processes is often left behind, so that the zonule is sometimes named the ciliary processes of tlie vitreous body. In addition to the lymphatics of the cornea and retina already described, the recent researches of SchwalGe have shown that spaces exist within the eyebaU. which com- municate with the lymphatic system. The slit-like in- terval between the sclerotic and choroid, or perichoroidal space, is regarded as a receptacle for lymph lined by an endothelium; from] it lymphatics arise, which pierce the

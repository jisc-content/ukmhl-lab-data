34 ANATOMY. ends rounded, and the sides somewhat flattened. Its average length in the people of the British Islands is a little more than 7 inches; its greatest breadth about 5.^ inches; and its height, from the plane of the foramen magntmi to the vertex, about 5| inches. Its greatest circumference is about 21 inches. The breadth of the face across the zygomatic arches is about 5 inches. The average capacity of the brain cavity is 92 cubic inches. The British skull is dolico-cephalic and orthognathic. The lateral regions of the skuU are called the temporal fossae, and give origin to the temporal muscles. Under cover of each zygomatic arch is the zygomatic fossa. At the bottom of this is a hoUow between the superior maxilla and sphenoid, called sphenomaxillary fossa, from which the pterygo-maxillary fissure extends downwards between the pterygoid and superior maxillary; and the spheno- maxillary fissure extends upwards into the orbit. The orbit is a four-walled pyramidal cavity, with the base directed forward to the face, and the apex backward to the brain cavity. At the apex are the foramina in the sphenoid, through which the nerve of sight and other nerves pass from the brain to the eyeball, muscles, and other soft structures within the orbit. The nostrils open on the front of the face by a large opening situated between the two superior maxillae, and bounded above by the two nasals. The sides of the opening pass down almost verticaUy to join the floor, and are not rounded off as in the ape's skuU; from the centre of the floor a sharp process, the nasal spine of the superior maxiUee, projects forwards, and forms a characteristic feature of the human skuU.

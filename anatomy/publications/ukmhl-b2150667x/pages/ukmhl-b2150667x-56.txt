40 ANATOMY, The Humerus, or bone of the Upper Arm (Fig. 9), is a long bone, and consists of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity of this bone possesses a convex spheroidal smooth surface, the head, for articulation -with the glenoid fossa of the scapula; it is surrounded by a nar- row constricted nech, and where the neck and shaft become continuous with each other, two processes or tuberosities are found, to which are attached the rotator muscles arising from the scapular fossae. Between the tuberosities is a groove in which the long tendon of the biceps rests. A line drawn through the head of the humerus perpendicular to the middle of its articular surface, forms with the axis of the shaft of the bone an angle of 40Â°. The shaft of the humerus is cylindriform above, but flattened and expanded below; about midway down the outer surface is a rough ridge for the insertion of the deltoid muscle, and on the inner surface another rough mark for the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The demarcation between the cyUndri- form and expanded parts of the shaft is marked by a shallow groove winding round the back of the bone, in which the musculo-spiral nerve is lodged. The lower extremity of the humerus consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular presents a small head or capitelhim for the radius, and a pulley or trochlea for the movements of the ulna in flexion and extension of the limb. The non-articular part consists of two condyloid eminences, internal and external. From the external, or epi- condyle, a ridge passes for some distance along the outer border of the bone ; it gives origin to the supinator and extensor muscles in the fore-arm. From the internal emi- nence, or epi-trocUeay a ridge passes up the inner border of

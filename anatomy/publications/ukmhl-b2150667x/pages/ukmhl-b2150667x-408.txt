ANATOMY. 392 cells ttemselves. The epithelial lining of the duct is continuous with the cells of the rete Malpighii of the cuticle. In the axilla and groin the sweat glands are much larger than in the skin generally. The sweat glands arise as flask-shaped pouches of the rete Malpighii projecting into the cutis, which in course of time become elongated into tubes, and the cells contained in which become the secreting cells of the gland. The cutis, with its vascular and nervous structures, is produced by a differentiation of the ceUs of the meso- blast. The two layers of the epidermis, with the ceUular prolongations into the hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, are differentiations of the cells of the epiblast.

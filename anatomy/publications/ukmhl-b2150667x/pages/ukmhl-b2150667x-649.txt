STEUCTURE OF LUNGS. 633 tlie lobules of the Iwiff. These lobules are cot limited to the surface, but are found in great numbers throughout its entire substance, where they are so closely packed together that their boundaries are indistinct. The lung may therefore be regarded as built up of many thousands of lobules. In the human fcBtus, but more readily in foetal sheep and calves, the lobules may be teased asunder without much difficulty, by tearing through the intermediate pnnnpofivp fivscno Tn J^'^- 172.—Portion of the Lung of a foeta cuuneotive ussue. in f„ g,^^^^ ^i^g diyjsion imo LobiUes. fliQ o^nlf Imv.^ <-Tir„T At the I'lglit boi'cler of the fifTUve tile indi- tue aauit lUng cney are yi^^^i lobules have been separated from ™„_„ »i„ „i„ -J.

The lobules are about the size of peasj they are irregularly pear-shaped, the broader end being directed towards the surface of the lung, whilst the narrow end receives a terminal branch from the bronchial tube. The connective tissue of the lung not only separates the lobules from each other, but forms a layer beneath the pulmonic pleura, which is on the one hand continuous with the interlobular connective tissue, and on the other with the sub-endothelial connective tissue of the pleura. Con- nective tissue also surrounds the bronchus and blood- vessels at the root of the lung, and is prolonged along with the vessels and bronchus, as their tunica adventitia, into the substance of the organ, M'here'it becomes continuous with the interlobular connective tissue.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 119 becomes a cell; if it remains as a mere clump of proto- plasm, it is a cytode. These various methods of multiplication are all con- firmatory of Schwann's generalisation of the descent or derivation of cells from pre-existing cells. But as the nucleated cell, either with or without a cell wall, is not, in the present state of science, regarded as the simplest and most elementary unit capable of exhibiting vital pheno mena, and as these phenomena can be displayed by indi vidual clumps of protoplasm, without the presence of a nucleus, some modification of the doctrine, as regards the formation of the tissues from nucleated cells, seems to be necessary. For, although there can be no doubt that all the tissues are mediately derived from the ovum or funda- mental cell, and that most of the tissues are derived directly from nucleated cells, yet there is reason to think that a differentiation of a cytode clump of protoplasm into tissue may take place, so that the direct formation of such a tissue would be, not from a nucleated cell, but from the more simple cytode. Hence a more comprehensive gene- ralisation, to which observers have gradually been led from the consideration of numerous facts, has now been arrived at,â€”that the tissues and organs of the body, what- ever may be their form and composition, are formed of protoplasm, or produced by its differentiation; and that the protoplasm itself is derived by descent from the proto- plasm substance of the primordial germ-cell. Some, in- deed, have contended that protoplasm, cells, and their derivatives can arise by a process of precipitation or aggregation of minute particles or molecules in an or- ganic infusion, and that living matter may be thus spon-

275 THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. the central space may be seen from before backwards the grey upper surface of the pear-shaped corpus striatum, and to its inner and posterior part a small portion of the optic thalamus, whilst between the two is the curved flat band, the tomia semicircularis. Resting on the upper surface of the thalamus is the vascular fringe of the velum interposi- tum, named choroid plexus, and immediately internal to this fringe is the free edge of the white posterior pillar oj the fornix. The anterior cornu has the anterior end of the corpus striatum projecting into it. The posterior cornu has an elevation on its floor, the hippocampus minor, and between this cornu and the descending cornu is the eleva- tion called eminentia collateralis. Extending down the descending cornu and following its curvature is the hippocampus major, which terminates below in a nodular end, the pes hippocampi ; on its inner border is the white tcenia hippocampi, continuous above with the posterior pillar of the fornix. If the tajuia be drawn on one side the hippocampal fissure is exposed, at the bottom of which the grey matter of the gyrus hippo- campi may be seen to form a well-defined dentated border (the so-called fascia dentata). The choroid plexus of the pia mater turns round the gyrus hippocampi, and enters the descending cornu through the great transverse fissure be- tween the taenia hippocampi and optic thalamus. The lateral ventricle is lined by a cyUndrical epithelium, ■which is in many parts cihated, and which rests on a layer of neuroglia. This Hning is continuous through the fora- men of Monro with that of the third ventricle, which again is continuous with the lining of the fourth ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius. A Httle fluid is con-

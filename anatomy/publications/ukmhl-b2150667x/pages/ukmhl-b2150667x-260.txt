ANATOMY, 244 peronei, and forms witli it the external saphenous nerve that passes to the outer side of the foot and little toe. The internal popliteal also supplies the muscles of the calf and the popliteus muscle, and ends as the posterior tibial nerve. The posterior tibial nerve passes down the back of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis posticus and long flexors of the toes, gives off a cutaneous branch to the skin of the heel, and terminates by dividing into the internal and external plantar nerves. The internal plantar nerve supplies the skin of the sole and sends digital branches to the skin of the great, second, third, and tibial side of the fourth toes; it also supplies muscular branches to the abductor poUicis, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor brevis poUicis, and two inner lumbrical muscles. The external j)la7itar nerve suppHes digital branches to the skin of the Uttle toe and fibular side of the fourth toe, and muscular branches to aU the muscles of the sole of the foot which are not supplied by the internal plantar nerve. The Sacro-Goccygeal plexus is the smallest belonging to the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves. It is formed by a part of the fourth sacral, the fifth sacral, and the coccygeal nerves. It Hes in front of the last sacral and the first coccy- geal vertebra, and gives origin to communicating, visceral, muscular, and cutaneous branches. The Gommunicatvtig branches join the lower sacral and the coccygeal gangUa of the sympathetic system; the Visceral pass to the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic, and through it to the bladder and rectum; the Muscular to the levator ani, coccygeus, and sphincter ani extemus muscles; the Cutaneous to the skin about the anus and tip of the coccyx.

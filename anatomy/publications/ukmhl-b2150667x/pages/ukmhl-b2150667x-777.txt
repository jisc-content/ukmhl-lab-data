This epithelial string forms the neck of the enamel •organ. After a time, however, the growth of the connec- tive tissue, forming the lips of the primi- tive groove, causes the neck of the ena- mel organ to atrophy, ■so that all communi- cation between the Fig. 210.—Vertical secfion-througliflie gum to enamel OTgan and the show the formation of the Dental Papilla, e' n • ^ -j-T, T the epithelium covering the gum ; n, tlie neck superficial epitheilUm of en, the enamel organ ; ^), the dental papilla; ct, sub-epithelial connective tissue.

When enclosed in its sac the embryo tooth, though per- fectly soft, acquires a shape, which enables one to recognize to what group of teeth it belongs. After a time it begins to harden and to exhibit the characteristic tooth structure. The dental papilla is more vascular than the surrounding connective tissue, from the Wood-vessels of which its vessels are derived. The papilla abounds in cells which are, in the first instance, rounded and ovoid in shape. Changes then ta^te place in the cells situated at its periphery, which become elongated and branched, and form layers of cells, which Waldeyer has appropriately named oclonto- 3 c

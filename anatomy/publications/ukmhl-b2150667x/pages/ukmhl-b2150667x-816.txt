ANATOMY. 800 THE UEETHEA. As the Urethra in the male is the excretory duct for both the urine and the secretion of the genital glands, the consideration of its anatomy will be deferred until the next chapter. The urethra in the female, conveys only the urine. It is a tube about \\ inch long, which, arising as a funnel-shaped tube from the neck of the bladder, passes downwards and forwards under the pubic arch to open on the vulva, between the nymphse, immediately above the orifice of the vagina, and about an inch below the clitoris. It is imbedded in the anterior waU of the vagina, and is in a part of its course surrounded by the fibres of the compressor urethraj muscle. It is lined by a mucous membrane, con- tinuous with that of the bladder, which is elevated into longitudinal folds. This membrane is covered by a strati- fied squamous epithelium, and mucous glands open on its surface. The wall of |the urethra, external to the mucous membrane, is very vascular, and contains large'veins; the vessels are mingled with connective tissue and a circular layer of non-striped muscular fibres.

481 DORSAL AETERY OF FOOT. a. Muscular to the muscles of the front of the leg. ' b. Reanrent Tibial Articular arises as soon as the anterior tibial has passed to the front of the leg, and ascends in the substance of the tibialis anticus to the knee. c. External Malleolar runs outwards to the region of the external malleolus, behind the long extensor of the toes. d. Internal Malleolar runs inwards to the region of the internal malleolus behind the tibialis anticus. The malleolar arteries supply the ankle joint. The Dorsal Artery of the Foot is a direct continua- tion of the anterior tibial artery; it runs forwards from the front of the ankle to the first metatarsal space, where it enters the sole of the foot to join the external plantar artery and assist in the formation of the plantar arch. It rests on the inner row of tarsal bones and lies between the extensor longus hallucis and the extensor communis digi- torum; it is crossed by the innermost tendon of the ex- tensor brevis digitorum, and is covered by the skin and fascia of the dorsum of the foot. It is accompanied by two vense comites, and the anterior tibial nerve is immediately to its outer side. Its branches are as follows :â€” a. Tarsal branch runs outwards under cover of the ex- tensor brevis digitorum to supply it and the tarsal joints. h. Metatarsal branch arises in front of the tarsal, and passes outwards under cover of the extensor brevis. It supplies the tarso-metatarsal jpints, and gives off interos- seous branches to the three outer interosseous spaces to supply the dorsal interossei muscles, which branches are prolonged on the dorsum of the toes. c. Marginal branches to the skin of the inner border of the foot.

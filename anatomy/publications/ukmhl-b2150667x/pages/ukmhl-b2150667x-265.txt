THE BRAINâ€”MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 249 motor nerves arising from the opposite half of tlie cord, and consequent paralysis of the muscles supplied by those nerves. The olivary fasciculus is formed partly of fibres of the anterior column of the same side, and partly of fibres arising from the grey matter of the oKve, It is continued upwards through the pons to the cerebrum. The restif orm body is formed principally of fibres of the funiculus cuneatus of the posterior column of the same side, but partly of fibres of the lateral column, and also of the arciform fibres from the anterior column, and from the grey matter of the superior and inferior olives. As the restiform body is continued upwards to the cerebellum, and forms its inferior peduncles, the arciform fibres have been called by Solly the superficial cerebellar fibres of the anterior columns. Through the restiform body the cerebellum is connected vsdth the pos- terior, lateral, and anterior columns of the cord as well as with the olivary nuclei in the grey matter of the medulla oblongata. The posterior pyramid consists of the posterior median column of the cord, and is prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. The fasciculus teres is formed of a small part of the lateral column of the cord, and is also prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. The grey matter of the medulla oblongata, which contains numerous multipolar nerve cells, is in part continuous with the grey matter of the spinal cord, and in part consists of in- dependent masses. As the grey matter of the cord enters the medulla it loses its crescentic arrangement. The posterior cornua are thrown outwards towards the surface, lose their pointed form, and dilate into rounded masses named the grey tubercles of Rolando {Fig. 79), whilst portions are pro- longed into both the posterior pyramid and the restiform

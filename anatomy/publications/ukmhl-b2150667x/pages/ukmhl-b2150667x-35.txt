19 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”THOEAX. by their costal cartilages to the side of the sternum, and are called sternal or true ribs; the lower five do not reach the sternum, and are named asternal or false, and of these the two lowest, from being unattached in front, are called free or floating. AH the ribs are articulated behind to the dorsal vertebrag, and as they are sym- metrical on the two sides of the body, the ribs in any given animal are always twice as numerous as the dorsal vertebrae in that animal They form a series of osseo- cartilaginous arches, which extend more or less perfectly around the sides of the chest. A rib is an elongated bone, and as a rule possesses a head, a neck, a tubercle, and a shaft. The head usually possesses two articular surfaces, and is connected to the side of the body of two adjacent dorsal vertebra; the neck is a constricted part of the bone, uniting the head to the shaft; the tubercle, close to the junction of the shaft and neck, is the part which articu- lates with the transverse process of the vertebra. The shaft is compressed, possesses an inner and outer surface, and an upper and lower border, but from the shaft being somewhat twisted on itself, the direction of the surfaces and borders is not uniform throughout the length of the bone. The ribs slope from their attachments to the spine, at first outwards, downwards, and backwards, then down- wards and forwards, and where the curve changes from the backward to the forward direction an angle is formed on ^ the rib. The first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs articulate each with only a single vertebra, so that only a single surface exists on the head : the surfaces of the shaft of the first rib are almost horizontal; those of the second very obKque; the eleventh and twelfth ribs are rudi-

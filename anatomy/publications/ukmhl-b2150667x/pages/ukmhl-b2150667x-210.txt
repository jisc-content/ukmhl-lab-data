ANATOMY. 194 tures can be distinguished in it: a (Fig. 63), a delicate trans- parent investing membrane,—^tbe so-called tubular or primitive memhrane, or neuri- lemma ; c, a delicate thread, extending along the axis of the fibre,—^the axial cylinder or central band of Remak ; B, a substance which lies be- tween the primitive mem- brane and the axial cylin- der,—^the white substance of ''^iot'irg\h^/rurcoXur''r?: Schwann, or the medullary ^^^^^^^r^y sheath.

The investing membrane is a perfectly pellucid, homogeneous structure, with nuclei arranged at intervals in it. It is bebeved to be absent from the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, as weU as at the peripheral terminations of many nerves. The meduUary sheath is a fatty and albummous sub- stance, which refracts the light strongly. Not unfre- Quently it collects into Uttle baU-hke masses, and some- times causes irregular bulgings on the fibre, and pro- duces a knotted, varicose appearance; at other tmies it becomes granular, and makes the fibre opaque. By gentle pressure it can be squeezed out of the broken end of a C Eanvier has described the meduUaiy sheath as,

vi PEEFACE. and by Mr C. Berjeau, to each of whom I desire to express my thanks for the care that has been taken in delineating the several objects. Except when stated otherwise, the microscopic specimens, from which the illustrations of the minute anatomy of the organs have been taken, were prepared, with his customary care and skill, by my assistant, Mr A. B. Stirling. For the use of the- woodcuts, in illustration of Dr Thin's observations, I am indebted to that gentleman, and to the publishers of the Edinburgh Medical Journal. My thanks are also due to my friend, Dr J. A. Eussell, for the trouble he has bestowed in revising the proof-sheets of the latter half of the book. March 1877.

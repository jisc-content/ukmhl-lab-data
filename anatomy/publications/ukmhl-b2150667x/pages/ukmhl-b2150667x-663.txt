THE MOUTH. 647 attached by two slips to the lower jaw opposite the canine teeth. The sphincter oris approximates the lips and closes the mouth. Levator communis arises from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxilla; it descends by the side of the nose and divides into two slips, the one of which ends in the ala of the nose, the other blends in the upper lip with the orbicularis oris. From its double insertion and action this muscle is often called levator labii superioris alceque nasi. Levator labii superioris j^oprius arises from the supe- rior maxillary and malar bones, where they form the lower border of the orbit; it descends into the upper lip to blend with its muscular fibres. Levator ang%di oris arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla: it passes downwards and outwards to the angle of the mouth to blend with the other muscles situated there. Zygomaticus minor, a slender muscle, arises from the anterior end of the zygomatic arch: it passes down- wards and forwards, and usually joins the levator labii superioris. Zygomaticus major arises from the zygomatic arch behind the minor : it passes downwards and forwards to the angle of the mouth. Risorius muscle of Santorini consists of scattered fasci- culi, which arise from the fascia covering the masseter muscle : it passes transversely inwards to the angle of the mouth, and is often described as a part of the platysma. Depressor labii inferioris arises from the front of the inferior maxilla between the svmphysis and mental fora-

440 ANATOMY. pectoral muscles, and supply the skin of the front of the chest; the second and third perforating arteries pass to the mammary gland : anterior intercostals run outwards in the upper five or six intercostal spaces, and inosculate with the aortic intercostals : musmlo-phrenic, one of the two terminal branches, runs outwards along the line of origin of the diaphragm, and assists in supplying that muscle: superior epigastric, the other terminal branch, descends in the waU of the abdomen in the sheath of the rectus, and supplies that muscle. d. Stqoerior Intercostal arises from the back of the second part of the subclavian; it descends into the back of the cavity of the chest in front of the neck of the first rib, and ends in two branches, one for the firsts the other for the second intercostal space. Before it enters the chest it gives off the deep cervical artery, which passes backwards between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, and then ascends on the back of the neck between the complexus and semi- spinalis colli muscles to supply them. It is equivalent to the dorsal branch of an aortic intercostal, and sometimes arises directly from the subclavian. The branches, which arise either directly or indirectly from the subclavian artery, may be arranged, according to their distribution to the parts which they supply, in three groups :â€” 1st. To neck, thyroid gland, windpipe, brain, and spinal cord : vertebral, inferior thyroid, ascending cervical, super- ficial cervical, deep cervical arteries ; 2c?. To walls of trunk: internal mammary, superior intercostal arteries;

ANATOMY. 810 lumen, so as to form a series of projecting columns of nucleated protoplasm. From the free ends of these columns long filaments protrude, which look at first like cilia, but are seen on further examination to be the atten- uated tails of the spermatozoa. The protoplasm of the spermato-blasts is colourless, granulated, and easily torn. The nuclei, situated near the attached ends of the columns, are lai'ge and oval, and contain a nucleolus. Those nuclei which lie near the free ends of the columns are specially modified to form the heads of the spermatozoa, and the protoplasm immediately surrounding them becomes con- tinuous with the nucleus, and differentiates into the body and filamentous tail of the individual spermatozoa. As the development proceeds, the spermatozoa liberate themselves from the spermato-blasts, and become free in the seminal tube. In the meshes of the network formed by the sper- mato-blasts, numerous distinct cells, capable of being sepa- rated from the network, are situated. They are often globular in form, and contain one or more nuclei. The precise function of these cells has not been determined, and they have been named indifferent sperm cells; it is not inprobable that they are spermato-blasts in the earlier stages of formation. It is not until the spermatozoa reach the rete testis, or the vasa efferentia, that they become entirely free from the protoplasm of the spermato-blasts, in connection with which they were formed, when they then assume a power of active movement. The indifferent sperm cells and the spermato-blasts repre- sent the epithelium of the seminal tubes in the lobes of the testis and in the rete testis. In the vasa efferentia and epididymis, as far as the globus minor, the seminal ducts

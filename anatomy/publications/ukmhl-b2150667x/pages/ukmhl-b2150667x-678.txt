662 ANATOMY. where it joins its fellow of the opposite side. Its lower fibres are in relation to the upper fibres of the oesophagus. Middle constrictor, or hyo-pharyngeus muscle, arises from the great and small cornua of the hyoid bone and from the stylo-hyoid ligament; its fibres radiate in a fan-shaped manner, and curve backwards to be inserted into the middle line of the posterior surface of the pharynx, where it joins its fellow. Superior constrictor, or gnatJio-pharyngeus muscle, arises from the side of the tongue and adjacent buccal raucous membrane, from the back of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the lower third of the posterior border of the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid; its fibres curve backwards to be inserted into the middle line of the posterior surface of the pharynx, where it joins its fellow; but the highest fibres are inserted into the pharyngeal tubercle on the under surface of the basi-occipital. The upper border forms a concave curve from the origin to the insertion, and the fibrous tunica pharyngis interna fills up the interval between it and the basis-cranii. Stylo-pharyiigeus muscle arises from the root of the styloid process : its fibres run obliquely downwards and inwards, between the superior and middle constrictors, to be inserted partly into the posterior border of the thy- roid cartilage, and partly to blend with the adjacent part of the muscular wall of the pharynx. Palato-pharyngeus muscle arises in the soft palate, where it decussates across the mesial plane with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side : its fibres pass downwards in the posterior pillar of the fauces, and spread

EXTEKNAL CABOTID AKTEEY. 467 stemo-mastoid muscle : a meningeal branch, wLicli ascends through the jugular foramen to the dura mater : princeps cervids branch to the deep muscles of the back of the neck: occipital branches to the scalp. e. Posterior Auricular artery arises from the external carotid in the substance of the parotid gland. It ascends behind the ear, and supplies auricular branches to the back of the auricle of the ear; cranial branches to the scalp adjacent to the ear: and a stylo-mastoid branch, which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen. /. Ascending Pharyngeal artery arises close to the origin of the external carotid, and ascends in relation to the wall of the pharynx to supply it, the tonsU, and soft palate; its size is in inverse ratio to that of the ascending pala- tine branch of the facial. It also gives meningeal branches through the jugular foramen to the dura mater. g. Temporal artery, one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, arises in the parotid gland. It ascends superficially to the root of the zygoma, and in front of the ear to the scalp, where it divides into two branches, an anterior and a posterior temporal artery, which supply the scalp of the side of the head and the anterior surface of the auricle: in old persons the temporal branches become very tortuous. The temporal artery, whilst in the parotid, gives origin to the transverse facial artery, which runs forwards to the face superficial to the masseter, and immediately below the zygoma : the transverse facial some- times arises directly from the external carotid. h. Internal Maxillary artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, arises in the substance of the parotid gland, and passes forwards and

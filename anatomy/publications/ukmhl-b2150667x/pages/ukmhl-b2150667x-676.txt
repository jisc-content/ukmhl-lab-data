The epiglottis projects upwards immediately in front of the orifice of the larynx, and marks the boundary between the buccal part of the pharynx and the superior orifice of the larynx. Seven openings communicate with the interior of the pharynx (fig. 181). Into the upper or nasal portion are the two posterior nares, separated from each other by the posterior edge of the nasal septum; and the trumpet- shaped mouths of the two Eustachian tubes open, one on each side, in line with the posterior end of the inferior turbinated bone of the same side. Below the soft palate is the posterior orifice of the mouth; behind the epiglottis is the superior aperture of the larynx; opposite the sixth cervical vertebra the pharynx communi- cates with the oesophagus. Structure.â€”The wall of the pharynx consists of three coats, an external muscular, an internal mucous coat, and an intermediate fibrous membrane, which blends with the submucous coat. The muscular coat consists of three pairs of circularly arranged muscles, the constrictors of the pharynx; and of two pairs of longitudinally-arranged muscles, the stylo- pharyngei and palato-pharyngei, with occasionally a third pair, the salpingo-pharyngei. The constrictor muscles extend from the lateral wall to the middle line of the posterior wall of the pharynx, and are named from below upwards the inferior, middle, and superior constrictors; they lie on three different planes, so that the inferior con- strictor overlaps the middle, and the middle the superior. Inferior constrictor, or laryngo-^iharyngeus muscle, arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx,

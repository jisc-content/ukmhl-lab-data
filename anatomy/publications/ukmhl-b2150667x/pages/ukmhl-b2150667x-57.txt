APPENDICULAR SKELETONâ€”UPPER LIMB. 41 the shaft of the bone; this eminence gives origin to the pronator and flexor muscles in the fore-arm. In nearly two per cent of the bodies examined in the anatomy-rooms in the University of Edinburgh, a hooked process has been seen projecting from the shaft of the bone, about 2 inches above the epi-trochlea; this process is connected to the epi-trochlea by a fibrous band, so as to form a foramen, which has been called supra-condyloid. In these cases the median nerve invariably passes through the foramen, and not unfrequently is accompanied by the brachial artery. In the feline carnivora and some other mammals a foramen constantly occurs in this part of the humerus, through which, as a rule, both nerve and artery proceed, though in the common seal it transmits only the nerve. Before describing the two bones of the fore-arm, the anatomist should note the range of movement which can take place between them. In one position, which is called supine, they lie parallel to each other, the radius being the more external bone, and the pahn of the hand being directed forwards; in the other or prone position the radius crosses obliquely in front of the ulna, and the palm of the hand is directed backwards. Not only the bones of the fore-arm, but those of the hand are supposed to be in the supine position when they are described. The Radius (Fig. 9) is the outer bone of the Fore-arm, and like all long bones possesses a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or liead has a shallow, smooth cup for moving on the capitellum of the humerus; the outer margin of the cup is also smooth, for articulation with the ulna and annular ligament; below the cup is a constricted neck, and immediately below the neck a tuberosity for the

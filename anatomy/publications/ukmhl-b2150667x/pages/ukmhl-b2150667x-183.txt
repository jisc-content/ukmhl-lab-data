167 OSSEOUS TISSUE. invests'all the exterior of a bone, except wliere tbe'encrust- inw cartilaÂ£:e is continuous with its articular end. It is subdivided into two layers: a firm ''external fibrous layer (Fig. 54, S P), consisting of bundles of connective tissue, wMcb decussate with each ^^s^^^^s^^p^^^sp^^ are found, which give off slender processes at various points of their periphery, and partly of larger granular cells, which lie next the bone itself. Processes of the soft inner layer are prolonged into the Haversian canals, in which, as Goodsir pointed out, a layer of cellular sub- stance lies between the wall of the canal and its contained blood-vessel, so that these canals are not, as in macerated bones, empty passages, but are filled up by the blood- vessels and the cellular layer. The Marrow occupies the medullary canal of a long bone and the spaces in the cancellated tissue of bones generally. It occurs in two forms, red and yellow marrow. Red marrow is found in the bones of the foetus generally, and in the cancelli of the plate-like, short, and irregular bones at a more advanced period. It consists

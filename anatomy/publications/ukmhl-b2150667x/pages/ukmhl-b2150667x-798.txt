ANATOMY. 782 genitally absent. Occasionally the upper ends of the two kidneys have been seen to be united together by an inter- mediate portion of kidney substance, situated in front of the abdominal aorta, when the conjoined organs formed a horseshoe-shaped kidney. Structure of the Kidney. The kidney, though situated in the abdomen, does not possess a serous coat. In rare instances, however, the peri- toneum has been seen to invest it more or less completely, and in these cases the kidney was not a fixed, but a movable organ, known as a floating kidney. The proper coat of the kidney is a fibrous membrane completely investing the organ. It can be readily stripped off the surface, and in doing so very delicate processes of connective tissue may be seen passing from its deep sur- face into the substance of the kidney. It is also continu- ous at the hilus with the sheaths of the various structures, which enter the gland. The inner layer of the proper coat contains a wide-meshed network of non-striped mus- cular fibres. When the fibrous coat is stripped off, the surface of the kidney is seen to be quite smooth, and of a brownish-red colour. In infants and children it is not unfrequent to find fissures extending for some distance into the substance of the kidney, a condition which indi- cates the lobular construction of the gland. In some mam- mals, as the ox, the bear, the cetacea, the lobules can be readily separated from each other, and the organ is divided into numerous independent remdes; but in the human

733 LITER. ' As a lobule of tlie liver is a liver in miniature, and as the structure of the entire liver is the sum of the structure of its constituent lobules, it will be necessary to examine with care the constituent parts of a lobule, and the arrange- ment of the vessels, duct, and nerves which pass to and from it. A hepatic lobule is composed of blood-vessels, secreting cells, and bile ducts, with perhaps nerves and lymphatics. The blood-vessels will first be considered. The liver receives its supply of blood through two vessels, the portal vein and hepatic artery, and the blood brought by both these vessels leaves the liver through the large hepatic vein. The portal vein conveys to the liver the venous blood from the stomach, spleen, pancreas, gall bladder, and small and large intestine. It ascends to the transverse fissure, and before it enters the liver divides into two branches, one for the right and one for the left lobe. In its course, within the liver, the portal vein divides and subdivides after the manner of an artery. It is closely accompanied by the hepatic artery and duct, and, along with them, is invested by the fibrous sheath, called Glis- son's capsule. The terminal branches of the portal vein run between the lobules, and are named, from their posi- tion, the interlobular branches. The interlobular branches lie around the circumference of a lobule, and anastomose with each other. They partly terminate directly in a capil- lary network situated within the lobule, and partly give off fine branches, which enter the lobule before they end in the capillary network. The intralobular capillaries form a close network, which converges from the periphery of the lobule, where they spring from the interlobular

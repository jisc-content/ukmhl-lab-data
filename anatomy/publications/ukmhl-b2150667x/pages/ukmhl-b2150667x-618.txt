ANATOMY. 602 The free edges of the vocal cords are thrown into vibra- tions in the production of the voice. The modifications which take place in their degree of tension, and in the size of the rima in connection with the production of the notes, and the elevation or lowering of their pitch, are questions which are more appropriately discussed in works on physiology. Mucous Membrane of the Larynx. The larynx is lined by a mucous membrane, continuous above, through the superior opening, with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and below, through the inferior opening, with that of the trachea. It is thin, especially where it covers the true vocal cords, but in the arytepo- epiglottidean folds it is thicker and the sub-mucous tissue is looser : it does not possess a high degree of vascularity. Its surface is covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium, intermingled with goblet-shaped ceUs; except near its superior orifice, and over the true vocal cords, in which locilities it is squamous. The sub-epithelial connective tissue of the mucosa contains a quantity of elastic fibres. .Numerous racemose glands are found opening on the sur- face of the laryngeal mucous membrane. They are very abundant on the back of the epiglottis, in which they are lodged in small pits, and in the walls of the laryngeal pouches. Collections of lymphoid tissue are also found in the subepithelial tissue of the mucosa.

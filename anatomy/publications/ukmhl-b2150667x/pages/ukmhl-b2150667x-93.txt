77 JOINTS AND MUSCLES. considered. Three pairs of greatly expanded muscles— the external obHque, internal oblique, and transverse-—lie at the sides and in front; and two pairs of muscles—^the recti and pyramidales—are situated wholly in front. The internal obKque and the transverse muscles are attached above to the ribs, behind to the lumbar spine, below to the Uiac crest and to a strong band, Poupart's ligament, extend- ing from the crest of the ilium to the pubic spine; the ex- ternal oblique has similar connections above and below, but is not attached behind to the lumbar spine. The muscles all terminate in front in strong expanded tendons, called the anterior ahdominal aponeuroses, which blend together in the middle Hne anteriorly to form the band called linea alba, which stretches longitudinally from the xiphi-sternum to the pubic symphysis. These expanded tendons enclose the recti muscles, which pass from the pubic crest upwards to the cartilages of the three lower true ribs; and the pyramidal muscles, which pass from the body of the pubis to be inserted into the Hnea alba. The entire arrangement is admirably adapted for completing the walls of the great abdominal chamber, and for enabling the muscles to com- press the abdominal viscera, an action which takes place when the contents of the bowels and bladder are being expelled during defsecation and micturition. Bones and joints play a more important part in the formation of the walls of the thoracic than of the abdo- minal cavity. Not only are there twelve thoracic vertebrae behind, and the sternum in front, but the twelve ribs on each side arch more or less completely forward from the spine; and the seven upper ribs, through their costal cartilages, articulate with the sternum.

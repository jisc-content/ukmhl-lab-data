THE PERICAEDIUM. 395 bright red, pure or arterial blood; as it traverses the systemic capillaries it parts with certain of its constituents to nourish the organs and tissues, and as it also receives from them waste products it becomes impure blood; in which condition it flows back to the right side of the heart by the systemic veins as dark red, or venous blood; hence the right side of the heart is often called the venous side. The blood which flows from the right side of the heart along the pulmonary artery is this dark-red, venous blood ; as it traverses the pulmonary capillaries it is purified by the action of the air in the lungs, it parts with carbonic acid, takes up oxygen, and is changed into arterial or pure blood, in which condition it flows back by the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart, which consequently is caUed the arterial side. The object of the pulmonary circulation, therefore, is to reconvert into pure blood the blood which has been rendered impure during its passage through the systemic capillaries. The anatomy of the heart, and of the pericardium, the bag in which it is enclosed, will first be described. THE PERICAEDIUM. The Pericardium is a bag which envelopes the heart. It is situated in the cavity of the thorax, and occupies the middle division of the space called mediastinum, between the two lungs; it lies therefore behind the sternum, and m front of the spinal column, but projects more to the left than to the right side of the mesial plane. Laterally the pericardium is in relation to the lung, pleura, and phrenic nerve; but the lungs, when inflated during inspiration,

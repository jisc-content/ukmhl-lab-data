179 MUSCULAE TISSUE. otlier by a delicate, areolar connective tissue, or perimysium. The size of the fasciculi varies in different localities; in the hollow viscera they are so large that their arrangement can be observed with the naked eye; but in the skin, the walls of gland- ducts, &c., they can only be seen with the aid of the microscope. If a fasciculus be carefully torn up with needles it can be resolved into its constituent fibres, and the number of the fibres varies with the size of the fasciculus. The non-striped fibres are pale and abnost colourless, with soft, ill-defined outlines, from g^V^th to ToVfftt inch in diameter; they are rounded . r 1 r'i<5- 58.—A, afasci- m lorm or laterally compressed, and are so cuius of non-striped ., ' muscular fibre; B, easily flattened by artificial pressure that, isolated muscu- they have erroneously been regarded as flat "^'^'^^ magnified, or ribbon-shaped fibres. When digested for a few hours in dUute nitric or hydrochloric acid, and sometimes even without any reagent, the fibres may be resolved into elon- gated fusiform cells—the contractile fihro-celh of Kolliker -which vaiy in length from ^i^th to ^i^th inch, and which taper off usuaUy into attenuated ends. In the middle of each ceU is a characteristicaUy elongated, rod- shaped nucleus, and sometimes the substance of the ceU is finely granular, or even faintly longitudinaHy striped. No ceU waU or sarcolemma can be distinguished. In some locahties, as was pointed out by Lister in the minute artenes in the web of the frog's foot, isolated contractile nbro-ceUs are wound spiraHy around the wall of the vessel. The cell substance refracts light doubly. .

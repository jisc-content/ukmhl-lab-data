LEVATOR ANI. opening as it passes forwards, and extends as far as the so-called central tendinous point of the perineum, where it often joins the acceleratores urinse and transversi perinei muscles. The sphincter in its normal condition of con- traction simply closes the opening, but, under the influence of the will, a more powerful contraction can be induced, so as to resist the entrance of foreign bodies into the rectum. As the Levatores ani muscles are in such intimate relation to the rectum, they may now be described. They form a pair of symmetrically arranged muscles, which descend from the pelvic wall to its perineal outlet. Each arises anteriorly from the back of the body and of the horizontal ramus of the os pubis, posteriorly from the ischial spine, and between these attachments from the pelvic fascia, where it splits into its parietal and recto- vesical layers. The muscle passes downwards and inwards to the middle line of the floor of the pelvis to be inserted as follows: most posteriorly into the side of the tip of the coccyx; from the tip of that bone to the anus into the median raph6 of the perineum, where it joins it* fellow; then into the lower end of the rectum in close relation to the external sphincter; whilst the most ante- rior fibres descending by the side of the prostate reach the median raph6 of the perineum in front of the anus, and blend, on the perineal aspect of the prostate, with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side. Owing to the relation of the anterior or pubic fibres of origin of the levator ani to the prostate gland in the male, they are sometimes named the levator prostatoe muscle. In the female the pubic fibres of origin lie in relation to the side

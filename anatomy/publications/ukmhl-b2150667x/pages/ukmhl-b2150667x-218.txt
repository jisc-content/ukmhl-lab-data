202 ANATOMY. continuous with, a nerve fibre, and has been named the axial- cylinder process (Fig. 68). This process was first recog- nised by Deiters in the cells of the spinal cord; but HadUch and Koschennikoff have since described the central process of the cells of the cerebellum as continuous with a medullated nerve fibre; and the latter observer has pointed out, that from the base of a pyramidal nerve cell in a cerebral con- volution a process may be traced directly into a nerve fibre. Hence it would appear that the multipolar nerve cells may have two modes of union with nerve fibres—one directly through the passage of the non-branched axial-cylinder pro- cess into a fibre, the other through the origin of fibres from the minute network in which the branched protoplasm processes terminate. The branched processes of adjacent nerve cells may also blend with each other, so as to form an anastomosing cell network, though these anastomoses are, in all probability, not so frequent as was at one time supposed. Schultze has pointed out that not only'the protoplasm substance of the body of a multipolar nerve cell, but both the non-branched and branched processes, possess a fibrillated structure similar to that described by him in the axial cylinder of the nerve fibres. Peripheral Und-Organs or U7id Bodies.—Nerve fibres at their peripheral extremities terminate in connection with peculiar structures, named end-hodies, terminal bodies, or peri- pheral end-organs, which are situated in the several organs of the body. The motor nerves end in the voluntary and in- voluntary muscles; the vaso-motor nerves end in the mus- cular coat of the blood-vessels; the sensory nerves end in the skin, mucous membranes, and organs of special sense; and it is probable that secretory nerves terminate in con-

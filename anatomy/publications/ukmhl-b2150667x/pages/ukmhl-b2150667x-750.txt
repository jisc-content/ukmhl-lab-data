At a, a, the capillaries of One capillaries of one lobule communicate with those adjacent to it. From an injection by T. A. Carter, lobule to SOme ex- tent communicate with those of adjacent lobules. The Tiepaiic artery, a branch of the coeliac axis, closely accompanies, as already stated, the portal vein, and divides into two branches, for the right and left lobes. It enters the trausverae fissure and ramifies, along with the portal vein, through the substance of the liver. It is the nutrient artery of the liver, and gives off three series of branches: a, vaginal branches, which are distributed to the walls of the portal vein, the hepatic duct, and to Gbsson's capsule, probably also to the wall of the hepatic vein. They end in a capillary network in these structures, from which vaginal veins arise that terminate in the portal vein. J, capsular branches, which are distributed to the fibrous coat of the liver and end in a capillary network, from which arise capsular veins that join the portal vein. The capsular branches anastomose with the diaphragmatic arteries, in the areolar tissue which attaches the posterior border of the liver to the diaphragm, and sundry offshoots which pafia

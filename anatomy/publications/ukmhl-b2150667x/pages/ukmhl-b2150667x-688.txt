672 ANATOMY. Abdominal Cavity and Peritoneum. As the remaining portions of the Alimentary Canal are situated in the Abdominal Cavity, it will be advisable, before describing their anatomy, to give an account of the form and boundaries of that cavity, of its division into regions, and of the general arrangement of the peritoneum, which constitutes its lining membrane. The Abdominal Cavity, Abdomen, or Belly, is the largest of the three great cavities of the body. It occupies about the lower two-thirds of the trunk, and extends from the diaphragm above to the pelvic floor below. As its walls, except in the pelvic region, are chiefly formed of muscles and of fibrous membrane, they are much more distensible than those of the thorax, and permit considerable modifi- cations in the size of the viscera, contained within the cavity, to occur. The abdomen is elongated in form; its vertical diameter is greater than either the transverse or the antero-postcrior diameter. The superior boundary is formed by the con- cave vault of the diaphragm, and by the seven lower pairs of ribs and costal cartilages: in this boundary occur the opening through which the oesophagus passes into the abdomen; also the apertures for the transmission of the great blood-vessels, the nerves and the thoracic duct. The inferior boundary is formed by the levatores ani and coccygei muscles, and the pelvic fascia: in relation to this boundary are the termination of the rectum and anal ori- fice, the termination of the urethra, and in the female that of the vagina also. The anterior boundary is formed above by the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall and

CHAPTEE V. NEEVOUS SYSTEM. The Nervous System consists of a number of organs which are named respectively Nerve Centres, Nerves, and Peripheral End-organs. The largest and most important Nerve Centres are the brain and spinal cord, which together constitute the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, and are lodged in the cranial cavity and spinal canaL But, in addition, nimierous small bodies, usually oval in form, technically called ganglia, are situated in other localities, and form smaller nerve centres. The Nerves are white cords or threads which traverse the different regions of the body, both axial and appendicular, for a greater or less distance, for the purpose of connecting together the other sub-divisions of the nervous system. The Peripheral End-organs are minute structures connected with the peripheral extrem- ities of the nerves. These end-organs are situated in the skin and other organs of sense, in the glands, blood-vessels, and muscles. The nerves establish communications and con- duct nervous impulses, either between different nerve centres, or between nerve centres and peripheral end-organs, so as to associate together in their action parts of the nervous system often widely separated-from each other. Nerves, therefore, are internuncial structures. When a nerve con- nects two nerve centres together it is intercentral. When

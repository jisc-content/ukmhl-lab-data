JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”LOWER LIMB. 101 -erect the Hp joints are fully extended, and the mechanical arrangements in and around these articulations are such as to enable them to be retained in the extended position with but a smaU expenditure of muscular power. As the weight of the body in the erect attitude faUs behind the joints, the strong anterior fibres of their capsular liga- ments are made tense, and the extended position of the joints is preserved. So long as the centre of gravity falls within the basis of support of the body, i.e., the space between the two feet when standing on both legs, the body wiU not fall. If the body is made to lean forward, then the capsular ligament is no longer tense, and the glutseal muscles are put in action to re-extend the trunk on the thigh, and prevent it from falling forward ; if the body is made to lean to one side or the other, the round ligament is made tense, or the strong Uio-tibial band of the fascia lata of the thigh, which stretches from the ihum to the tibia, is put on the stretch, and falling sideways is pre- vented. When, in standing erect either on one or both feet, the balance of the body is disturbed, then various muscles both of the trunk and lower limb are brought into action to assist in preserving the erect position. In the erect position the weight of the trunk is transmitted through the acetabula to the heads of the thigh-bones, but the position and connections of the round ligament enable it to suspend that portion of the trunk the weight of which is thrown upon it, and to distribute the weight over the head of the femur. The Knee is the largest and most complicated joint in the body. It consists of the femur, tibia, and patella. The patella moves up and down the trochlear surface of

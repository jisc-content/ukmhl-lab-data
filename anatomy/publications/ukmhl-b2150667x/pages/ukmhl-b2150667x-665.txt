THE MOUTH. 649 l)eaeath the mucous membrane. Each arises from the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw : the fibres pass down- wards and inwards to be for the most part inserted, along with the opposite muscle, into a tendinous median raphe which extends from the symphysis menti to the body of the hyoid bone; the most posterior fibres are, however, inserted directly into the body of the hyoid. The name of dia'pliragma <yris has been applied to the muscular floor formed by the two mylo-hyoid muscles. The muscles of the Tongue have been described, as a part of that organ, on p. 376 : those of the Soft Palate will be described on p. 666. The action of the muscles of the mouth has been described on p. 84 e.s. The mouth is lined by a red-coloured mucous membrane, which becomes continuous at the posterior buccal orifice with that of the pharynx, and at the margins of the lips with the skin of the face. The mucous membrane cover- ing the alveolar portions of the jaws, and surrounding the necks of the teeth, is called the gum. From the outer sur- face of each jaw it is reflected to the inner surface of the cheeks and lips. A narrow band passing from the symphysis of the lower jaw to the lower lip is the frcenum labii in- ferioris, and a similar band from the upper jaw to the upper lip is the/rce?mm lahii stiperioris. From the inner surface of the lower jaw the mucous membrane is reflected to the floor of the mouth, and abroad band, caHed frcenum lingua;, is prolonged to the middle line of the under sur- face of the tongue. From the back of the dorsum of the tongue three slender folds of the mucous membrane, the frcena ejngloUidis, are prolonged to the front of the epi- glottis. From the soft palate on each side two folds of 2 T

506 ANATOMY. from left to right behind the manubrium sterni, between it and the three great arteries arising from the transverse part of the aortic arch. These veins have no valves. Each brachio-cephalic vein has opening into it: a, the inferior thyroid vein, vrhich descends from the thyroid body, in front of and by the side of the trachea, and receives the inferior laryngeal vein: h, the internal mammary vein, which is formed by the junction of the vente comites of the internal mammary artery; these venae comites receive small veins corresponding to the several branches of the artery : c, the superior intercostal vein, except in those cases in which this vein joins the azygos (fig. 137). \ The subclavian vein is a large trunk, formed by the junction of the superficial and deep veins of the upper limb, which are arranged as follows : â€” The superficial veins of the hand commence at the tips and sides of the fingers, from whence they proceed to the back of the hand, beneath the skin of which they may be distinctly seen. They then ascend along the fore-arm, forming three large veins: the radial, on the outer side; the tdnar, on the inner; and the median, in the middle of the front of the fore-arm. At the bend of the elbow the median divides into two branches, of which one, named median-cephalic, joins the radial to form the cephalic ; the other, named median-basilic, joins the ulnar to form the basi- lic vein. Into one or other of these two branches the surgeon generally makes an opening when he is desirous of drawing blood from the veins of the arm. The cephalic vein ascends along the upper arm, and a little below the clavicle pierces the fascia to join the axillary vein. The basilic pierces the fascia about the middle of the upper arm, and joins the

599 MUSCLES OF LAEYNX. The crico-thyroid muscles increase the tension of the vocal cords. As to the mode in which this tension is occasioned there is a diflference of opinion. It is usu- ally believed that the crico-thyroid muscles rotate the thyroid cartilage about a transverse axis, passing horizon- tally through the two crico-thyroid joints, and de- press the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage so as to elongate the vocal cords in front. But some anatomists hold that the thyroid cartilage is fixed by the action of the thyro-hyoid muscles, that the crico-thyroid muscles then rotate the cricoid cartilage on the thyroid, by drawing the front of the cricoid cartilage upwards, which depresses the back of the cricoid and the arytenoid cartilages, and pea I'iG. 166.â€”Diagram of the Eima Glottidis, to illustrate the action of the muscles on it.

In the right hand figure the rima is shown as almost closed by the action of Ica the pair of lateral arytenoids and ar, the arytenoid muscle, to, ta, the pair of thyi o-ary- tenoid muscles. In the left hr.nd figure the rima is shown widely open by the action of pea, the pair of posterior crieo-aiytenoid muscles; C, the upper border of the cricoid cartilage. elongates the posterior ends of the vocal cords. The thyro- arytenoid muscles approximate the opposite ends of the vucal cords, and thus relax them, by drawing the thyroid

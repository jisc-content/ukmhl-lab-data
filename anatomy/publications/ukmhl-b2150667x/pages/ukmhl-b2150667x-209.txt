NERVOUS TISSUE. 193 these fibres, a portion of a cerebro-spinal nerve may be selected. In tlie first place, it will be seen to be invested by a sheatli of connective tissue, tlie perineuritim, whicli gives off processes tliat pass into tbe nerve, and subdivide it into fasciculi or funiculi Eact fasciculus is in its turn composed of nerve fibres, wMch are separated from each other by bundles of delicate connective tissue, prolonged from the perineurium, in which the nutrient blood- vessels of the nerve ramify. The perineuria! connective tissue investing a fasciculus, presents, when treated with nitrate of silver, polygonal markings, which, as Ranvier showed, are the outHnes of a layer of flat endothelial- like ceUs. The size of a nerve is in relation to the number and size of its fascicuH, and the size of a fasciculus is in relation to the number of its fibres. The fibres and the fascicuH He paraUel to each other in the same nerve; but as nerves branch at intervals, the more external of the fasciculi diverge from the main stem tÂ» form the branches. In the white matter of the brain and spinal cord the nerve fibres are not arranged in such definite fascicuh as in a distributory nerve, and the con- nective tissue between the fibres is the soft, dehcate form called neuroglia. A medullated nerve fibre is an elongated cylinder, which, when examined in the body of a Hving animal, or im- mediately after removal from the Hving body, consists apparently of a soft, homogeneous, or glassy-looking sub- stance enclosed within a limiting membrane. When ex- amined some time after death, or after the addition of re- agents, such as water, spirit, ether, collodion, acetic acid, &c., It loses its homogeneous aspect, and the following strac- N

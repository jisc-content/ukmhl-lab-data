EXTERNAL CAROTID AETERY. 465 runs along the upper border of the isthmus to join the opposite superior thyroid. h. The Lingtial artery arises just above the superior thyroid artery, and runs upwards and inwards, above the great cornu of the hyoid bone to the under surface of the tongue. It passes between the hyo-glossus and middle con- strictor muscles, and then between the mylo-hoid and genio-hyo-glossus, when it assumes the name of ranine artery. From it arise a hyoid branch, which runs inwards in relation to the upper border of the hyoid bone : a dorsalis lingua; branch, which supplies the muscular substance and mucous membrane of the dorsum of the tongue ; this branch is usually represented by a number of small branches : a sublingual branch, which supplies the sublingual gland and the adjacent muscles. The ranine termination of the lingual artery runs along the under surface of the tongue as far as the tip to supply its muscles and mucous mem- brane. c. Facial artery arises above the lingual, but sometimes along with it by a common trunk. It runs upwards and inwards through the digastric triangle, then mounts over the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw, close to the anterior border of the masseter muscle, and ascends in a tortuous manner across the side of the face, close to the angle of the mouth, the angle of the nose, and the inner angle of the eye. It is crossed immediately after its origin by the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric muscles, and when in the digastric triangle it is enclosed by the submaxUlary gland. On the face it is covered by the platysma and zygomatic muscles, and lies on the buccinator, levator anguli oris, and levator labii superioris. The

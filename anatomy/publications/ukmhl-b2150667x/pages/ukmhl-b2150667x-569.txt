553 LYMPHATIC GLANDS tinuous with, the endothelium of the vasa afferentia and efferentia. Through the researches of His, Frey, and Keckling- hausen, it has now therefore been established that a lym- phatic gland is permeated by an anastomosing system of lymph passages or channels, continuous with, the afferent and efferent vessels. These, channels surround the folli- cular masses of lymphoid tissue, and as the stream of lymph flows through the gland, it washes lymph cor- puscles out of the meshes of this lymphoid tissue, which corpuscles mingle with the lymph stream and are carried onwards in its flow. The lymphatic glands are the seats of production of lymph corpuscles, and are the great centres of origin therefore of the white corpuscles of the blood. Each lymphatic gland receives at least one small artery, which enters at the hilus, and breaks up into branches that in part ramify in the capsule and trabecular frame- work, and in part pass directly to the follicular tissue. Capillaries are distributed in the follicular tissue in which they-form a plexus; they supply the pabulum for the nutrition and production of the lymph corpuscles : veins arise from this plexus and pass out of the gland at the hilus. In many lymphatic glands a quantity of fibrous con- nective tissue, named by His the hilus-stroma, is situated at the hilus, and surrounds the artery, vein, and vasa efferentia. It also not unfrequently contains a collection of fat cells. Vaso-motor nerves accompany the blood-vessels into the gland, and supply not only their muscular coat, but the muscular tissue of the capsule and trabeculee. Nerve-ceUs have also been described on these nerves by some observers. 2 N

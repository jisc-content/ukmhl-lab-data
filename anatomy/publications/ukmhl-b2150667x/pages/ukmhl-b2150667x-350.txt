ANATOMY. 334 cornea first seen by Schlemm have been carefully examined by recent observers. They arise from the ciliary nerves, and enter the margin of the cornea in from twenty to forty fasciculi, which run from the circumfer- ence to the centre and to the anterior surface of the cornea, and give off nu- merous branches. Thin states that the nerves lie free in the lymph spaces and canals, and that be- tween them and the flat cells lining the canals is Fio. 100.—Cornea trcntefl with nitrnte of the fluid-fiUed spaCC in silver and chloride of gold; i, anastomosis , . , • ,■ between two cornea corpuscles; i, stellate whlch the migrating COr- cornea corpuscle; </, nerve fibre lying in a lymphatic canaL (From.

From these plexuses delicate branches again arise, some of which penetrate between the cells of the anterior epithelium, whilst others end in the proper tissue of the cornea. Kiihne stated that the terminal fibres ended in the cornea corpuscles, but this statement has not been confirmed.

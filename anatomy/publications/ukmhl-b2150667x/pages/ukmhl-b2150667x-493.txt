477 FEMORAL ARTEKY. branches: external circumflex, which passes outwards behind the rectus and sartorius and between the branches of the anterior crural nerve to divide into ascending, transverse and descending branches ; the ascending passes under the tensor fascias femoris to anastomose with the gluteal artery ; the transverse enters the substance of the vastus externus, and the descending passes downwards and outwards on and in the vastus externus, partly to supply that muscle, and partly to reach the outer side of the knee. Sometimes the external circumflex arises directly from the femoral, and sometimes its ascending, or its ascending and transverse branches arise from the femoral, whilst the descending branch springs as an independent branch from theprofunda. The internal circumflex arises from the inner side of the profunda opposite the origin of the external circumflex : it rims backwards first between the psoas and pectineus, then between the adductor brevis and obturator externus, then between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris to reach the back of the thigh; it supplies the muscles between which it passes, also the hip joint. The perforat- ing branches, usually three in number, and named, from above downwards, first, second, and third j^erforating, pass to the back of the thigh to supply the hamstrings; the first and second pierce the short and great adductors. The second perforating gives origin to the small nutrient artery which enters the nutrient canal in the femur to supply the medulla of the bone. The terminal part of the pro- funda, sometimes called the foiirth perforating artery, not only supplies the adductor magnus, but gives branches to the short head of the biceps. The branches which arise either directly or indirectly

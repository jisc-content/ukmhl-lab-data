SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, 317 great splanchnic nerve, ^by the union of branches from the thoracic gangha, the 3d to the 10th inclusive; it pierces the eras of the diaphragm, and passes to the prevertebral solar plexus; small splanchnic nerve, also to the solar plexus from the 10th or llth thoracic ganglia ; smallest splanchnic nerve, from the 12th thoracic ganglion to the renal plexus. g, Hypogastric branches, from the lumbar and sacral ganglia to the prevertebral hypogastric plexus. The Prevertebral Cardiac plexus is situated at the base of the heart, and is divided into a superficial part, which lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta, and a deep part between the aorta and trachea. It receives the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric and the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. It contains collections of nerve cells and a dense plexiform arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives oflF branches to the heart, which wind around the surface of that organ and penetrate its muscular substance : on these branches minute ganglia are found which regulate its rhythmical movements. Through these branches and the cardiac plexus the heart is brought into connection with both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems of nerves. The sympathetic apparently regulates Its contraction, for when this nerve is stimulated the action of the heart is accelerated. The pneumogastric again exer- cises an inhibitory or restraining influence on the contrac- tions^ of the organ, for when this nerve is irritated the activity of contraction is diminished, but when divided it 13 greatly increased. The cardiac plexus also sends offsets to the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses for the supply of nerves to the lungs. The Prevertebral,Solar or Epigastric plexus is situated at

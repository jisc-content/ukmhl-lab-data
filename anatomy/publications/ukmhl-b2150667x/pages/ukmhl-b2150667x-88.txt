"72 ANATOMY. muscle is so placed that its tendon of insertion is perpen- dicular to the bone to which it is attached, it acts to great advantage; when placed obliquely or nearly parallel, a loss of power occurs. Many muscles at the commencement of contraction Lie obUquely to the bones which they move, but as contraction goes on they become more nearly per- pendicular, so that they act with more advantage near the close than at the commencement of contraction. If a muscle passes over only one joint, it acts on that joint only; but if it passes over two or more joints, it acts on them in succession, beginning with the joint next the point of insertion. A given movement may be performed by the contraction of a single muscle, but as a rule two or more muscles are associated together, and they are not unfre- quently so arranged that one muscle initiates the move- ment, which is then kept up and completed by the rest. Muscles producing movement in one direction have opposed to them muscles which by their contraction effect the opposite movement; when both groups act simultaneously and with equal force, they antagonise each other, and no motion is produced; when a muscle is paralysed or divided, its antagonistic muscle draws and permanently retains the part to its own side. The rapidity of action of a muscle is proportioned to the length of its fasciculi, its power of contraction to their number. Each muscle is invested by a sheath, the perimysium, formed of connective tissue. In the Hmbs and in the neck not only has each muscle a sheath, but a strong fibrous membrane envelopes the whole of the muscles, and assists materially in giving form and compactness to the region. This membrane is called generally a fascia or viuscular

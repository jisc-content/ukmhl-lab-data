LYMPH VASCULAK SYSTEM. 529 Lymph-Vascular System. The lymph-vascular system is an appendage of, and supplementary to the blood-vascular system, and consists of small tubes or vessels, the Lymphatic Vessels, and of collec- tions of Lymphoid or Adenoid Tissue, which form Lym- phoid Organs. It is sometimes called the Absorbent System, as it plays an important though not an exclusive part in absorbing materials which have to be transmitted to the blood, but the blood capillaries themselves are also directly concerned in absorption. LYMPHATIC VESSELS. The Lymph Vessels, or Lymphatics, are tubes with deli- cate transparent walls, which convey the fluid called lymph and chyle. They arise, in the form of microscopic networks, in the connective tissue on the surface and in the substance of the parts and organs of the body, and they terminate by joining the large veins at the root of the neck, so that their contained fluid flows into the blood towards the heart. They resemble veins in having a course from peri- phery to centre; in possessing valves, which are generally two in number and semilunar in shape, and in being divided into superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. In the limbs and axial parts of the body the superficial lymphatics are situated, like the superficial veins, in the subcutaneous tissue; whilst the deep lymphatics accom- pany the arteries and deep veins. But the internal viscera also possess a superficial and a deep set of lym-

THE AETEEIES. 415 from different arteries may be distributed in a common locality, may there unite together, and form what is called an inosculation or anastomosis, so that the blood from one artery may thus flow from it into another. The inoscula- tions of the branches of the same or of adjacent arteries are of great importance with reference to the mode in which a part receives its supply of blood when the main artery is obstructed, for through these anastomoses secon- dary channels are provided along which the blood may flow to a part. The most common anastomosis is by the formation of loops between adjacent branches; but some- times, as when the two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar, a convergence of two almost straight arteries takes place; and in other cases, as where the two anterior cere- bral arteries are joined together by the anterior com- municating, a connecting branch passes transversely across the mesial plane. A more complex form of anastomosis is when an artery (and a similar arrangement is some- times found in veins) rapidly subdivides into numerous branches, which may again join to form a trunk either with or without the formation of a plexus. This is called a rete mirabile, an arrangement not uncommon in the cetacea, and also found in the internal carotid arteries of rumi- nauts, in the mesenteric arteries of the pig, in the arteries of the limbs of the sloths and lemurs, in the caudal arteries of the armadillo, and in the arterial system of fishes The only examples of a rete in the human body are the glo- meruli, or convoluted Malpighian tufts of the kidney, and, the arterial distribution in the coccygeal and intercarotic bodies.

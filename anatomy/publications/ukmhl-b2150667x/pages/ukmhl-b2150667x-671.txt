655 SALIVARY GLA.NDS. internal maxillary branches: from the posterior auricular and temporal branches arise the small arteries which supply the parotid gland with blood. Emerging from the gland is the external jugular vein, which is formed in it by the junction of the temporal, internal maxillary, posterior auri- cular and transverse facial veins. Piercing the gland are the facial and auriculo-temporal nerves. The excretory duct of the gland, called Stenson's duct, passes forwards superficial to the masseter muscle, then pierces successively the fat of the cheek, the buccinator muscle and the mucous membrane, and opens on the inner surface of the cheek opposite the second upper molar tooth. The duct is between two and three inches long, and about the thickness of a crow quill. The Suhmaxillary gland is situated in the submaxillary triangular space, and rests against a shallow fossa on the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw. It lies for the most part on the mylo-hyoid muscle, but sends a process, along with the excretory duct, round the posterior border of the muscle, which process lies between the mylo- hoid and the hyo-glossus muscles. The gland is enclosed in a capsule formed of the cervical fascia, and is separated from the parotid gland by a deep process of that fascia named the sbylo-maxillary ligament. The facial artery, as it ascends to the face, passes through the substance of the gland and gives off glandular branches to supply it with blood. The excretory duct of the gland, called Wliarton's duct, runs forwards for two inches between the mylo-hyoid and the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus muscles, and ends by opening on the floor of the mouth by the side of the frsenum linguae.

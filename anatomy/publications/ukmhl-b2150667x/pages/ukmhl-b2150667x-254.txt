238 ANATOMY. and 6tli cervical; the serratus magnus muscle, through, the posterior thoracic branch, which also arises from the 5th and 6th cervical nerves; the greater and lesser pectorals, through the two anterior thoracic branches which arise, one from the outer and one from the inner cord; and the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi muscles, through the three subscapular branches, which arise from the posterior cord. The Cutaneous branches arise from the inner cord, and are the lesser internal cutaneous, which ends in the skin of the inner side of the upper arm, and joins the intercosto- humeral; and the internal cutaneous, which not only sends branches to the skin of the upper arm, but supplies the skin of the inner side of the forearm, both on its anterior and posterior surfaces. The Mixed branches are large and very important:â€”a. The Circumflex, from the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the deltoid and teres minor muscles, a cutaneous branch to the skin over the del- toid, and an articular branch to the shoulder joint, h. The Musculo-Spiral, which, as it were, continues downwards the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the triceps and anconeus, to the supinator longus and extensor carpi radiaUs longior muscles; by its internal cutaneous branch the skin of the back of the upper arm, and by its external cutaneous branch, the skin of the outer side of the back of the forearm. It then divides into the radial and posterior interosseous branches. The radial passes down the forearm to the hand, and suppUes the skin on the back of the thumb, index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The posterior interosseous pierces the supin- ator radii brevis, supplies the muscles on the back of the forearm and the articulations of the carpal joints, c, The

280 ANATOMY. velum interpositum and tlie body of the fornix; its floor, by the pons Tarini, corpora albicantia, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and optic commissure ; its anterior bound- ary, by the anterior pillars of the fornix, anterior commis- sure, and lamina cinerea ; its posterior boundary, by the corpora quadrigemina and posterior commissure. The cavity of this ventricle is of small size in the living head, for the inner surfaces of the two thalami are connected together by intermediate grey matter, named the middle or soft commissure; but in taking the brain out of the cranial cavity this commissure is usually more or less torn through, and the cavity is consequently enlarged. Imme- diately in front of the corpora quadrigemina, the white libres of the posterior commissure pass across between the two optic thalami. If the anterior pillars of the fornix be separated from each other, the white fibres of the anterior commisstire may be seen entering the two corpora striata. The pineal lody is a reddish cone-shaped body, enveloped by the velum interpositum, and situated upon the more anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina. From its broad anterior end two white bands, the pedimcles of the pineal body, pass forwards, one on the inner side of each optic thalamus. Each peduncle joins, along with the taenia semicircularis, the anterior pillar of the fornix of its own side. In its structure this body consists of a vascular stroma of connective tissue, in the meshes of which Ij-mphoid cells are contained. Branched corpuscles which are regarded as nerve cells are also found. Amylaceous and gritty calcareous particles, constituting the brain sand, are also found in it. Usually it is hollowed out into two or more small cavities. The function of the pineal body is not

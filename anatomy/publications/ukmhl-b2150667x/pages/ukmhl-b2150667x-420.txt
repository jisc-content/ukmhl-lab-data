ANATOMY. 404 ventricle, it has beea named the mod&rator land. In the bird the right auriculo-ventricular valve is a muscular structure. The base of the right ventricle forms to the left and in front of the auriculo-ventricular opening, a funnel-shaped prolongation, the conus arteriosus, from which the pulmo- nary artery arises, through the intervention of a strong fibrous ring. Surrounding the mouth of this artery is a valve called semilunar, which consists of three semilunar segments. Each segment is attached by its convex border to the artery where it springs from the ventricle. The opposite border is free, and possesses at its centre a minute nodule, the corpus Arantii, from which slender fibrous threads curve outwards at the free border and in the sub- stance of the valve to strengthen it. A thin lunated portion lies immediately within the free border. One surface of the valve is convex, and directed to the lumen (i.e., the space contained by the walls) of the artery; the other is concave, and directed to the wall of the artery, and between it and the wall is a pouch named sinus of Valsalva. The pulmonary artery extends upwards and to the left for about If inch, and then divides into two branches, one for each lung. The right ventricle is completely separated from the left by the ventricular septum, which passes obliquely from left to right, and from before backwards, so that it forms the posterior wall of the right ventricle and the anterior wall of the left. The apex of the septum is at the apex of the heart, its base or highest part is between the two auriculo-ventricular openings. Thuruam pointed out that the highest part is not formed of muscular fibres, but of the endocardial membrane, strengthened by fibrous

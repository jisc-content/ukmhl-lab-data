PLACENTA. 873 cular gland miglit be seen either longitudinally or trans- versely divided, but the number of glands in a given area was much fewer than in the non-impregnated mucosa, so that the increase in area of the decidna was obviously due to a great increase in the amount of interglaudular connec tive issue. The villi of the chorion were intimately adherent to^boj^h the surface of the decidua reflexa and the serotina forming the waU of the ovular chamber. This adhesion was due to an up-growth of the decidua between and surrounding the villi, so that the fixing and interlocking of the foetal and maternal structure seem to be due to a coincident growth both of villi and decidua, whereby the villi, even at this early stage of placental development, are ensheathed by the cell structures of the decidua. It has been customary for anatomists to state that the attachment of the villi to the decidua, not only in the human placenta, but in placentas generally, is due to the penetration of the villi into the tubes of the dilated utricular glands. The researches made by Ercolani and by myself, during the last few years, on the various forms of placenta in different groups of mammals, have however shown that the villi are not lodged in these glands, but are received in crypt-like depressions on the surface of the mucous membrane, formed during gestation by a hyper- trophy and folding of the mucous surface. For not only are the glands much fewer in number than the villi and the crypts which contain the villi, but in many mammals, as the pig, the mare, the lemurs, and the true ruminants, the glands can be seen to open on the free surface of the uterine mucous membrane in areas quite distinct from the crypts. 3 K

ANATOMY. ■452 the abductor indicis muscle, and, as the deep palmar arch it is covered by the flexor brevis poUicis and the flexor tendons of the fingers ; it rests on the interossei muscles and the metacarpal bones. The radial artery in the fore arm gives origin to the following branches :— a. Radial Recurrent arises just below the elbow, and ascends in front of the brachialis anticus to the interval between that muscle and the supinator longus. b. Muscular branches to muscles of fore arm. c. Anterior Radial Carpal arises close to the wrist, and forms with the anterior ulnar carpal an arch in front of the carpal joints. d. Superficial Volar arises close to the wrist, and descends to the ball of the thumb, where it supplies the muscles and inosculates with the ulnar artery to assist in forming the superficial palmar arch. At the wrist and back of the hand arise— e. Posterior Radial Carpyal, which runs across the back of the wrist, and forms an arch with the posterior ulnar carpal; from this arch arise the dorsal interosseous branches for the third and fourth metacarpal spaces. /. \st Dorsal Interosseous descends superficial to the second dorsal interosseous muscle as far as the cleft between the index and middle fingers. g. Dorsal branches for Thumb, two in number, descend on the radial and ulnar borders of the back of the meta- carpal bone of the thumb. h. Dorsal branch for Index descends on back of meta- carpal bone of index finger.

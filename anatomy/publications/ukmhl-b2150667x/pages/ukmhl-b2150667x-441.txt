VISCERAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA, 425^ other for the left lobe of the liver. In its course it gives off a, the pyloric branch, which passes to the pyloric end of the lesser curvature of the stomach : 6, the gastro-duodenal branch which descends behind the duodenum, when it divides into a superior pancreatico-duodenal, which sup- plies the pancreas and duodenum, and a right gastro-epiploic branch, which runs along the greater curvature of the stomach to supply branches to its anterior and posterior walls, and to the omentum : c, the cystic branch which supplies the coats of the gaU bladder: d, the terminal right and left hepatic branches, which supply the tissues of the liver. The Splenic artery is the largest branch of the coeliac axis. It passes to the left behind the stomach, and is lodged in a groove on the upper border of the posterior surface of the pancreas. It gives off a, pancreatic branches to supply the pancreas ; h, vasa brevia, which pass to the fundus of the stomach : c, the left gastro-ep>iploic artery, which runs along the greater curvature of the stomach, and supplies its anterior and posterior walls and the omentum: d, the terminal splenic branches, which enter the spleen at the hUus. The SuPEEiOB Mesenteric artery arises from the aorta a little below the coeliac axis. It lies at first behind the pancreas, then crosses in front of the duodenum, and descends between the two layers of the mesentery, inclin- ing towards the right iliac fossa. It gives off a, the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch, which supplies the pancreas and duodenum : h, the intestinal branches, about twelve in number, which arise from the left aspect of the artery, and descend in the mesentery to the coils of the jejunum 2 E

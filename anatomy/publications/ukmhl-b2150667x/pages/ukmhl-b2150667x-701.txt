685 STOMACH. STOMACH. The stomacli is the bag-like dilatation of the alimentary canal, connecting the oesophagus with the duodenum, in which the food is mingled with the gastric juice, and con- verted into a pulpy substanceâ€”the chyme. The stomach is situated in the costal zone of the abdominal cavity; three- fourths of its volume, according to Luschka, being con- tained in the left hypochondrium, whilst the remaining fourth extends into the epigastrium. About five-sixths of the organ lies to the left of the mesial plane, and one- sixth to the right. The stomach varies in size, shape, and somewhat in position, according as it is empty or full of food. When moderately full it is about one foot in length, whilst its greatest transverse diameter is four to five inches. Its general shape is pyriform, and it may be described as possessing two extremities, two surfaces, and two borders. The larger extremity, called the fundus, cardiac eodremity, or great cul-de-sac, is directed upwards so as to be in con- tact with the under surface of the diaphragm, whilst the smaller end, pyloric or duodenal extremity, is directed downwards, curves to the right, and becomes continuous with the duodenum. The surfaces form the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. When the organ is empty, the walls are flattened, and in apposition with each other by their inner surfaces; but when it is distended they are curved; the anterior convex surface, directed forwards and upwards, is in relation with the anterior abdominal wall, the diaphragm, and the under surface of the liver; the posterior surface, also convex, directed

838 ANATOMY. THE tTTEEtrS. The Uterus is the important organ which receives the ovum, and after impregnation retains it during embry- onic life, until its development being sufficiently advanced, the period of parturition arrives, when the fcstus is expelled from the uterus. In the non-impregnated state the uterus lies in the cavity of the pelvis, between the rectum and the bladder, and is about 3 inches long, 2 inches broad at the widest part, and not quite 1 inch thick.

The branches for the head, neck, and upper limbs arise as three large arteries from the upper surface of the trans- verse part of the aortic arch; they are named in the order in which they arise from right to left, arteria innominata, left common carotid, and left subclavian. The Arteria Innominata, or Brachiocephalic artery, is the largest branch of the arch of the aorta, and springs from the commencement of its transverse part. It passes upwards and to the right, to the root of the neck, on a level with the right sterno-clavicular articulation, and then divides into the right common carotid and the right sub- clavian artery. It lies in the upper part of the chest behind the manubrium sterui and in front of the trachea. The right brachio-cephalic vein and right pleura are to its right, the left common carotid artery is to its left, and the left brachio-cephalic vein crosses between it and the sternum. It gives off, as a rule, no collateral branches. Siihclavian System of Arteries. This system consists of the large artery of supply for the upper extremity, and of the branches, which arise either directly or indirectly from it. This artery bears different names in its course. It is called subclavian, as it passes across the root of the neck and under the clavicle ;

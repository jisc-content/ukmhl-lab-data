THE BLOOD, 125 nucleus has disappeared, then they are potentially cells, though no nucleus is visible. Whatever may be their exact homology, there can be no doubt that the non-nucleated mammalian red corpuscle, and the substance of the nu- cleated red corpuscle which lies outside the nucleus, are functionally identical with each other; the protoplasm hav- ing undergone a special chemical differentiation into hsemo- globin, a proximate principle characterised by containing iron as its essential constituent. The action of water, spirit, acids, alkalies, various gases, heat, cold, and electri- cal currents, on the red corpuscles has been studied by several observers, and the conclusion has been reached that the corpuscles consist of a " stroma," with which the colouring matter is blended, but from which it may be separated without the stroma affording any evidence of the presence of an investing envelope or membrane. When blood is drawn from the vessels the red corpuscles, in about half a minute, run together into piles, like rouleaux of coins (Fig. 29), which arrange themselves into irregular meshes. In inflammatory diseases, and in the blood of pregnant women, the piles of corpuscles form more readily, and at the same time sink rapidly below the surface of the fluid, so as to cause the "buJffy coat" seen in the blood coagnlum. In the healthy blood of horses a bufiy coat is formed as a natural condition of the coagulation. One of the most curious properties possessed by the living white blood corpuscle is that of protruding delicate processes from its circumference, which processes may change their shape, or be again withdrawn into the sub- stance of the corpuscle, which then resumes its former circular outline. These processes resemble the sarcode

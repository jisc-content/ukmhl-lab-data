597 MUSCLES OF LARYNX. Muscles of the Larynx. The muscles of the larynx are arranged in two groups, an extrinsic and an intrinsic. The extrinsic muscles are divided into a supra-hyoid and an infra-hyoid group. The supra-hyoid muscles are the digastric, stylo-hyoid, mylo-hyoid, and genio-hyoid. The infra-hyoid are the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, and thyro-hyoid. These muscles act on the entire larynx through their insertion into the hyoid bone, and through the attachment of that bone to the thyroid cartilage. Their description naturally comes, therefore, into that of the muscles acting on the hyoid. As the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles have a direct attachment to the alee of the thyroid cartilage, they vi^ill be described here. Sterno-thyroid arises from the back of the manubrium sterni, and the first costal cartilage; it ascends in front of the trachea, and is inserted into the oblique line on the outer surface of the thyroid cartilage. Thyro-hyoid arises from the lower border of the great cornu and the body of the hyoid bone, and is inserted into the same oblique line to which the sterno-thyroid is attached. From the attachment of these muscles to the thyroid cartilage, they can fix it, and put it in a better position to serve as a surface of origin for those intrinsic muscles of the larynx, which arise from it. The intrinsic muscles of the larynx arise from and are inserted into the cartilages of the larynx, and by their actioQ diminish or increase the tension of the vocal cords, diminish or increase the size of the rima glottidis, or affect the position of the epiglottis and the size of the superior

711 SMALL INTESTINE. consists of non-striped fibres which lie parallel to the surface of the membrane. It passes also into the substance of the villi, and lies around the closed end of the glands of Lieberkiihn; but, where the solitary and Payer's glands are situated, it is perforated, to allow the base of the foUicle to reach the submucous coat. Of the blood-vessels of the small intestine, the arteries enter the wall of the jejunum and ileum at its attached or mesenteric border, and are branches from the arcades of the superior mesenteric artery ; whilst the arteries for the duodenum are the superior pancreatico-duodenal of the gastro-duodeual branch of the hepatic artery, and the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. They run in the sub-serous tissue around the wall of the intestine; then pierce the muscular coat and supply it; they then enter the sub-mucous coat, and form a network from which branches pass into the mucous coat. The veins accompany the arteries, and form rootlets of the superior mesenteric vein. The Lymph-vessels, or ladeals, may be traced into the wall of the intestine at the mesenteric border; they form a network in the muscular coat, and then enter the sub- mucous coat, where they are very abundant; from this sub-mucous layer ofi'shoots pass through the retiform tissue, which lies between the Lieberkiihnian glands, into the villi. Where the solitary and Peyer's glands are situated the lacteals, as Frey has pointed out, form a system of anastomosing vessels around the base and mesial part of each follicle. The nerves are derived from the plexuses of the sympa- thetic, which accompany the branches of the superior

210 ANATOMY. Descriptive Anatomy op the Ceeebro-spinal Nervous System. In this section the anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord, and of the numerous distributory Nerves which arise from them, wiU be described. The brain and spinal cord are the largest and most important of all the nerve centres. They occupy the cranial cavity and spinal canal, and are continuous with each other through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone. As the arrangement of the struc- tures which compose the brain and spinal cord is extremely complex, and as the names applied to the several parts are numerous and often very arbitrary, it may be well, before commencing a detailed description, to make a few general observations on their mode of development. Development of the Cerebro-SpiTial Nervous Axis.—In order to comprehend the development of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, it will be necessary to say a few words on the arrangement of, and early changes in the germinal membrane or blastodenn in the ovum ^ of the vertebrata. This membrane con- sists of three layers of cells, the outer, middle, and inner germinal layers of Eemak and many other Gei-man em- bryologists, or the Fio 70 —Transversevertical section through the epiblast, mesoblast, biastocierm of a chick at the end of the second day. hypoblast of E, epiWast; M, mesoWast; H, hypoblast.

This depression gradually deepens and forms a groove, the dorsal, neural, or cerebrospinal gi-oove, the sides and bottom of which are lined by the layers of cells (Fig. 70)

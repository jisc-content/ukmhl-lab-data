ANATOMY. 156 the immature condition of the body than in the adult, for in early life the skeleton is in a great measure foi-med of it. As development and growth proceed, a considerable pro- portion of the cartilage becomes converted into bone, and is called, therefore, temporary cartilage, whilst the remain- ing portion continues as cartilage throughout life, and is termed permanent. The following varieties of cartilage, based on modifications in structure and appearance, may be recognised :— Cellular cai-tilase. Cells mth matrix substance. Matrix homogeneous. Matrix fibrous. (Hyaline cartilage.) (Fibro-cartilage.) White fibro-cartilage. Yellow fibro-cartilage. The Cellular or Parenchymatous Cartilage does not exist in the adult human body. It occurs, however, in the human embryo, in the embryos of aU the vertebrata, and in the larval stage of development of the tunicata, as the slender rod named chorda dorsalis or noto- chord.

In the lamprey and myxine it foms a continuous rod in the vertebral region. In fish generally, but more especiaUy in the cartUagmous group, it forms a jeUy-like mass, occupying the concavities between the bodies of the vertebra. The cells he m con- tact with each other.

348 ANATOMY. cornea ; but as the iris is in contact with, the front of the lens, the posterior chamber is reduced to a mere chink between the circumference of the iris and that of the lens. The Crystalline Lens is situated behind the iris and pupil, and in front of the vitreous body. It is a trans- parent bi-convex lens, with its antero-posterior diameter ^d less than the transverse, its posterior surface more convex than the anterior, and with its circumference rounded. It consists of a capsule, which encloses the body of the lens. The lens capsule is a transparent, smooth, structureless, and very elastic membrane, about twice as thick on the anterior as on the posterior surface of the lens. It is non-vascular in the adult, though in the foetus a branch of the central artery of the retina, which traverses the vitreous humour, ramifies in its posterior portion. A. single layer of polygonal cells lies between the body of the lens and the anterior portion of the capsule. The lens body is softer at its periphery than in its centre. It is built up of concentric layers, and on both the anterior and posterior surfaces lines are to be seen radiating from the central pole of each surface towards the circumference of the body. The radiated pattern varies in different animals. In the human foetus there are usually three lines, but in the adult they are more numerous. The lines on one surface do not lie immediately opposite those on the other, but are inter- mediate. By the action of strong spirit and other reagents the body of the lens can be split up from the periphery towards the centre in the direction of these lines, so that they mark the edges of apposition of its concentric laminae. Each lamina consists of numerous hexagonal fibres about -1- th inch wide, which extend from one surface to the"

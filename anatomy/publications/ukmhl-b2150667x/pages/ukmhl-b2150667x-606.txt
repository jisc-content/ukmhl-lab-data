590 ANATOMY. Its upper border slopes from beliiiid downwards and for- wards, and possesses a pair of articular facets pos- teriorly for the two ary- tenoid cartilages ; whilst in front of these facets it gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane and lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. The cricoid cartUage is connected to the thyroid by a pair of crico-thyroid joints and the crico-thyroid membrane. The crico- thyroid membrane is a structure at- tached below to the upper border of the cricoid car- tilage ; it consists of a mesial and of two lateral portions; the mesial part is attached above to the lower border of the middle portion of the thyroid cartilage; whilst each lateral portion runs upwards in close relation to the mucous lining of the larynx, and terminates in a thin free superior border, the inferior or true vocal cord ; as the anterior end of this cord is attached to the middle of the re- treating angle of the thyroid cartilage, and the posterior end to the anterior or vocal process at the base of the arytenoid cartilage, it may be more precisely called the inferior crico-thyro-arytenoid ligament (fig. 162). The a-ico thyroid joint is formed on each side between the inferior cornu of Fig. 162.â€”View of the interior of the left lialf of the Larynx, after the re- moval of the mucous membrane.

820 ANATOMY. THE PENIS. The Penis, or organ of copulation, is situated in the perineum in front of the triangular ligament and the pubic arch. It consists of a root, a body, and of the glans penis. By its root it is attached to the sides of the pubic arch : its body forms the bulk of the organ, whilst the glans is the terminal part in which is situated the orifice of the urethra. The base of the glans possesses a rounded border, or corona, behind which is a constricted cervix. The body of the penis possesses an upper flattened surface or dorsum, two lateral rounded surfaces, and an inferior rounded surface principally formed of the corpus spongiosum. The penis is invested by thin, freely movable skin, destitute of fat and hairs. Anteriorly the skin forms a loose fold, the preimce or foreskin, which may either cover the glans, or be 'drawn backwards from it. The inner layer of the prepuce is reflected over the surface of the glans, and behind and below the urethral orifice forms a thin fold, the frcsnum preinitii. The inner layer is smooth, thin, and moist, and has a muco-tegumentary character. Opening on its surface, more especially near the cervix, are the ducts of numerous sebaceous glands, the glands of Tyson, in which a peculiar odoriferous secretion is formed. The skin of the glans itself is covered with vascular and highly sensitive papillae, and is firmly at- tached to the subjacent spongy tisssue of the glans. At the root of the penis the integument is continuous with the hairy skin of the pubes and scrotum, and beneath the

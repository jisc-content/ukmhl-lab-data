852 ANATOMY. IS in relation to the skin and subcutaneous fatty fascia; Its deep surface rests on the aponeurosis covering the greater pectoral muscle. The mammary gland is divided into primary lobes, separated from each other by lobules of fat. Each primary lobe is sab-divided into secondary lobes, and these again into lobules, whilst the lobules consist of rounded acini or gland vesicles. From these lobules slender branched ducts arise, and the ducts from adjacent lobules join together to form larger ducts, these again join to form still larger ducts, until at length from 15 to 20 large-sized milk ducts are formed, which converge to the nipple to open on its surface by as many orifices. Prior to entering the nipple the ducts dilate into sinuses, in which the milk collects during lactation. The mamma is a compound racemose gland. The ducts are lined by an epithelium composed of short columnar cells. In the virgin the secreting cells within the acini are also columnar, but during lactation they swell out into polyhedral cells, and the gland vesicles at the same time become more dilated. The gland is supplied with blood by the perforating branches of the internal mammary artery, the aortic inter- costals, and the external mammary branch of the axillary artery, which end in capillary plexuses around the gland vesicles. Corresponding veins accompany these arteries. The anterior and lateral cutaneous nerves give branches to it. In the male the gland is rudimentary, and the nipple, though small, is always present. Cases have been known in which the male mamma has developed so as to secrete

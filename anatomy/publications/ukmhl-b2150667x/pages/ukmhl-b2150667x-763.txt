The characters of the permanent teeth will now be con- sidered. The Incisor Teeth, eight in number, are lodged in the front of the jaws, two on each side of the mesial plane. The upper incisors project downwards and forwards, the lower are directed almost vertically upwards. The oblique direction of the upper incisors in the Negroes, Caflfres, m. m. = 20.

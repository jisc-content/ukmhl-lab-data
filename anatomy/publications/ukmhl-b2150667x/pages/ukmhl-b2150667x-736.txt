The use of the ileo-ccecal valve is to impede or prevent the reflux of the contents of the large into the small intes- tine. When the ccecum and colon are distended the frsena of the valve are put on the stretch, and the two segments are approximated, so that the opening is reduced to a mere slit, or even closed, if there is great distension of the bowel. The circular muscular fibres in the segments wQl doubt- less also exercise a sphincter action on the orifice. Structure of the Large Intestine. The wall of the large intestine consists in the greater part of its extent of four coats, named from without inwards, serous, muscular, submucous, and mucous coats. The serous or external coat derived from the peritoneum, forms a complete investment for the flexures of the colon, the transverse colon, and the first part of the rectum. The ccecum has sometimes a complete serous coat, but more usually, it, together with the ascending and descending colon, have the serous coat only anteriorly and laterally. The second part of the rectum has only a partial serous investment, and the third part has no serous coat. Nume- rous pedunculated processes invested by the serous mem- brane, and containing lobules of fat, named aj)X'e7idices epiploicoe, are attached to the large intestine. The serous coat is loosely united to the subjacent muscular coat by areolar tissue, which is sometimes called the subserous coat. The muscular coat consists of non-striped fibres arranged

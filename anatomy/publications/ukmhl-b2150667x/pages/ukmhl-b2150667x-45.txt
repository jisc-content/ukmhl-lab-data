AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. 29 forming the temporo-maxillary joint. The tympanic portion forms in the foetus a ring, which enlarges subsequently into a curved plate that forms the waU of the external auditory meatus, or passage into the tympanum or middle ear. The tympanic and squamoso-zygomatic parts of the bone fuse together; but a fissure, called Glaserian, situated behind the glenoid fossa, marks their original separation; in this fissure the slender process of the malleus (one of the bones of the tympanum) is lodged. The petro-mastoid or periotic part of the temporal contains the organ of hearing, and is complicated in its internal anatomy. It extends forwards and inwards along the floor of the skull, and forms on the exterior of the skull the large nipple-shaped mastoid pro- cess. This process is rough on its outer surface, for the attachment of muscles, and is hollowed out internally into the mastoid cells or air-sinuses, which communicate with the tympanum or middle ear. The petrous-temporal is distinguished by its stony hardness, and has the form of a three-sided pyramid. Its apex lies in relation to the side of the body of the sphenoid; its base corresponds to the tympanic cavity and external meatus; its under surface is rough, and forms a part of the under surface of the skull; its anterior and posterior surfaces are smooth and in rela- tion to certain parts of the brab. The petrous part of the bone is traversed by a canal which transmits the internal carotid artery and sympathetic nerve into the cranial cavity; in its posterior surface is a passage, internal meatus, down which the seventh cranial nerve proceeds; at the bottom of the meatus the auditory part of that nerve enters the internal ear, whilst the part of the nerve which goes to the muscles of the face traverses a canal in

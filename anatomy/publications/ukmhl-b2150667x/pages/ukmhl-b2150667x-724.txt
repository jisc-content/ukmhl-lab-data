708 ANATOMY. The glands of Lieberkuhn are distributed throughout the whole length of the mucous coat of the smaU intes- tine. They are simple tubular glands, in form like test tubes, which lie vertically in the mucous membrane, and form its proper glandular layer (figs. 189,191.) The tubes are microscopic in size, vary in length from -^ih. to -^th. of a line, are sometimes closely set together, but in the localities where the solitary and Peyer's glands occur, they are more widely separated. The glands open on the surface of the mucous membrane between the villi ; and the opposite end of the tubes is closed and rounded, and reaches close to the mus- cular layer of the mucous coat. They are lined by a layer of columnar epithelium cells, continuous with the epithelial investment of the villi; supplementary and goblet cells, similar to those described on the villi, are situated be- tween the columnar cells. The glands are separated from each other by retiform connective tissue, in the meshes of which colourless lymphoid corpuscles exist in considerable numbers; the plexus of capillary blood-vessels, which is distributed outside the membrana propria of the gland tube, lies in this connective tissue. The connective tissue of the mucous coat is characterised generally by its retiform character, and by the diffusion of colourless lymphoid corpuscles in the meshwork.

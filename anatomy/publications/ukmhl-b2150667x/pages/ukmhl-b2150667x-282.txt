ANATOMY, 266 transverse external part of the parieto-occipital fissure ; the depth and extent of this fissure vary in different brains in Fig. 86.â€”Side view of the Brain in the skull.^ 1 The above view of the bram in situ, shows the relations of the sur- face convolutions to the regions of the skuU. R, fissui-e of Eolando, which separates the frontal from the parietal lobe. PO, parieto-occi- pital fissure between the parietal and occipital lobes. SS, fissure of Sylvius, which separates the temporo-sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal area Ues in front of the coronal suture. SF MF IF, the supero-, mid-, and infero-frontal subdivisions of the frontal 'area of the skull; the letters are placed on the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions; the inferior frontal region is separated from the middle frontal by the frontal Ipart of the curved line of the temporal ridge; the mid- from the supero-frontal by a line drawn backwards from the upper margin of the orbit thi-ougli the frontal eminence. SAP, the supero-antero-parietal ai-ea of the skuU; S is placed on the ascending parietal convolution, AP on the ascending frontal convolution. lAP, the infero-antero-parietal area of the skull; I is placed on the ascending parietal, AP on the ascending frontal con- volution SPP, the supero-postero-parietal area of the skull; the letters are placed on the angular convolution. IPP. the infero-

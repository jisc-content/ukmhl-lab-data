880 ANATOMY. texture. This opinion is based not only on the examination of the human placenta, but on the study of the comparative anatomy of the organ in a considerable number of mammals. For in every case a layer of maternal epithelium, derived from the uterine mucosa, was found interposed between the foetal vessels of the chorionic villi and the vessels of the maternal part of the placenta; whether the maternal vessels were simple capillaries, as in the diffused and cotyledonary forms of placenta, or dilated capillaries, as in the zonary placenta, the dome-shaped placenta of the sloth, or the discoid placenta of the ape and the human female. As regards the function of this layer of epithelium throughout the placental series, I agree with Ercolani in regarding it as a secreting epithelium, which separates and prepares from the maternal blood a secretion, to be absorbed by the vessels of the choiionic villi, and applied to the nutrition of the foetus. The passage of material from the maternal to the foetal system of vessels is not a simple percolation or diffusion through their walls, but is occasioned by the action of cells. The placenta, both in its function and in the relative arrangement of its constituent textures, is therefore a specially modified secreting gland, the excretory apparatus of which is represented, not by a system of ducts, but by the blood- vessels of the foetal villi.

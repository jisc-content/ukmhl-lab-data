As prolongations of the cortex, named the columns of BeHin, dip into the medullary part, they divide the latter into from ten to eighteen distinct masses, each possessing a pyramidal form; they are named the medullary pyramids, or pyramids of Malpighi. The base and sides of each of these pyramids are directed to, and bounded by the cortex : the apex forms a papilla, which projects into one of the calices, produced by the branching of the pelvis of the ureter. Each of these pyramids, with the cortical substance in immediate relation to it, forms one of the primary lobules of the kidney, and is homolo- gous therefore with one of the renules of the ox's kidney. If the surface of a section through one of these pyramids be examined with a pocket lens, it will be seen to possess a striated appearance, and the striae radiate from the papillary apex to the base of the pyramid. These strise indicate that the pyramid is principally composed of tubes, the tubuli uriniferi. The urinary tubules commence at the papilla, on the surface of which the openings of about twenty of these tubes may be seen. The kidney is there- fore a tubular gland. In order to trace out the arrangement of the tubes, it will be necessary to examine thin sections with higher powers of the microscope. If we start with a tubule, where it opens on the surface of a papilla, as the ductm papillaris, and trace it into a medullary pyramid, we find that in its course it bifurcates repeatedly at acute angles into smaller branches, which slightly diverge from each other, and ultimately reach the base of the pyramid. These branching tubes are called the straight or collecting tubes ; they then enter the cortex in bundles, which are

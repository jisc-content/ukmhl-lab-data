ENCEPHALIC NEEVES. 307 The Hypoglossal or ninth nerve springs out of the groove between the anterior pyramid and olivary body of the medulla oblongata, in series with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Its roots pass through the meduUa to the floor of the fourth ventricle, to arise from the nerve cells in two nuclei of grey matter situated close to the median furrow (fig. 80). This grey matter is in series vsdth the anterior cornu of grey matter in the spinal cord. The nerve passes out of the skull through the anterior condyloid foramen, and arches across the side of the neck to the tongue, to end in glossal branches for the supply of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. It also gives off—a, the descendens noni branch, which, after been joined by the communicantes noni from the cervical plexus, sup- pHes the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles; b, the thyro-hyoid branch to the thyro-hyoid muscle; c, the genio-hyoid branch to the genio-hyoid muscle. It communicates in the neck with the sympathetic, vagus, Hngual branch of the fifth, and cervical plexus. The group of Mixed Nerves wiU now be considered. The Trifacial or fifth is the largest cranial nerve. It springs by two distinct roots out of the side of the pons. The smaller or motor root arises from the nerve cells of a nucleus of grey matter situated in the back of the pons, near the floor of the upper part of the fourth ventricle.' The larger or sensory root has, according to Meynert, a complex origin—a, from a nucleus of grey matter in the pons to the outer side of the origin of the motor root; 6, by descending fibres which arise from nerve cells in the substance of the corpora quadrigemina, from the grey matter of the locus cteruleus, and from the longitudinal

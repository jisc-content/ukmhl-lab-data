184 ANATOMY. imbedded in a " groun'd-substance," that forms the alter- nating dim and bright discs, which substance he believes to be anisotropous, whilst the muscle rods are isotropous. He regards the ground-substance as the true contractile part of the fibre. Each transversely striped fibre is invested by a homo- geneous membrane, the sarcolemma or myolenvma, which is so transparent as to allow the characteristic transverse stri* to be distinctly seen through it. The sarcolemma is so closely incorporated with the periphery of the fibre, that its isolation and demonstration as a distinct membrane in the fibres of the mammalia are attended with some difficulty; but when water is added to the living fibre of frogs and fish, it is absorbed, and elevates the sarcolemma from the sarcous contractile particles. Thin describes the sarcolemma as covered by a layer of flat cells. If acetic acid be added to a muscular fibre the transverse striae become less distinct, and a number of oval bodies come into view. These are especially to be seen next the periphery of the fibre in relation to the inner surface of the sarcolemma, though some apparently lie deeper in the substance of the fibre. These bodies have long been known as the nuclei of the striped fibre. More recent investigations have, how- ever, shown that each nucleus lies in a little finely-dotted protoplasm, which often extends in a fusiform manner beyond the ends of the nucleus. These nuclei, with their investing protoplasm, have the anatomical characters of nucleated cells, and are called the rmiscle corpuscles. Some peculiar modifications of the striped muscular fibre are met with in certain locaUties. As a rule, this form of fibre does not branch; but in the muscles of the tongue

JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 107 of the muscles of the calf, the toes press against the ground so as to push the trunk so far in front of the advanced Umb as to be no longer safely supported by it; the hind- most limb is then raised from the ground by muscular action, and allowed to swing forward by its own weight, but guided by the muscles, until the toes touch the ground in front of the opposite limb. A step has now been made, and the limbs are in a corresponding but opposite position from that in which they were when the step commenced: a repetition of the act constitutes another step, and so the alternate action continues. At one moment in each step both feet touch the ground at the same time, i.e., when the hind foot presses against the earth. The act of running consists in a repetition of the movements of walking per- formed with so much greater rapidity that the feet never touch the ground at the same moment; the heels also are never brought to the ground. The propulsive action is also greatly increased by the extension of the hip and knee joints, so that a succession of small leaps on to alternate feet takes place. In leaping from the standing position the joints of both lower limbs, previously flexed, are suddenly and simultaneously extended, and the body is projected forwards with a rapid impulse. Development and Homologies of the Voltjntaky Muscular System. The voluntary muscles, like the hones and joints with which they are so intimately associated, are developed out of the middle of the three layers—the meso-blast—into which the germinal area or blastoderm of the young embryo is divided. The muscles of the axial skeleton are capable of subdivision into a gi-oup situated outside the endo-skeleton, i.e., between it and the integument— which muscles have recently been called epi-skeletal—and a group lying on the ventral surface of the vertebral bodies and within the

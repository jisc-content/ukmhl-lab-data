ANATOMY. 200 believe that they have traced it into the nucleus; but the spiral fibre apparently arises nearer the periphery of the cell. The pyriform cells are invested by a distinct capsule of connective tissue. The nerve fibres of these pyriform cells, although they both arise close together from one end of the cell, represent its poles. Should one of the poles, either in this, or in the bipolar form of nerve cell described in the preceding paragraph, be from any cause removed or not de- veloped, then the cell would be unipolar ; and if both poles were absent it would be apolar.

Cells of this kind are called multipolar, and in many locahties they pre- sent characteristic forms. In the grey matter of the spinal cord, more especially in its anterior horn, they give rise to numerous processes, and have a stellate or radiate form (Fig. 68). In the grey matter on the surface of the convolutions of the ^^romlumars\^^ cerebrum they are pyramidal in shape; caps^e'T^'connec: the apex is directed to the surface of the tM^- convolution, the base towards the white matter (Fig. 92); the processes arise from the base, apex,

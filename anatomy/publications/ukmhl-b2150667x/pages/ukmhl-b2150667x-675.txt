THE PHARYNX. 659 THE PHARYNX. The Pharynx is aa irregularly dilated canal, which forms a common passage, connecting the mouth with the oesophagus, and the nose with the larynx, so as to be sub- servient to the processes both of deglutition and respira- tion. It is situated in the upper part of the neck, and extends from the basi-cranial axis, which forms its upper boundary, as low down as the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, where it becomes continuous with the oeso- phagus. It lies in front of the six upper cervical verte- brie, with their prevertebral muscles, from which it is separated by some loose areolar tissue. It is placed behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, all of which com- municate with it through openings in its anterior wall. Its length is from 4i to 5i inches; the transverse diameter is greater than the antero-posterior, and it is wider opposite the back of the mouth and the great cornua of the hyoid bone, than opposite the back of the nose, or larynx; at its lower end it assumes a tubular form, where it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. Its walls are composed of muscles and membrane, which are arranged so as completely to wall in the tube laterally and pos- teriorly, but to permit of free communication in front with the nose, mouth, and larynx. If the pharynx be opened by a longitudinal incision through the pos- terior wall, two structures, viz., the soft palate and epiglottis, will be seen to project into it from the anterior wall. The soft palate, with the uvula depending from its lower border, inclines downwards and backwards, and divides the upper or nasal part of the pharynx from the

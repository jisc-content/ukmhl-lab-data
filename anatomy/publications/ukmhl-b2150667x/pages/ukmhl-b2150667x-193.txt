MUSCULAE TISSUE. 177 are also formed by the absorption of the diploe, and con- sequent separation of the two tables of the skull. Bones, therefore, are organs which are continually undergoing change. During growth additions are being made to their length and thickness, and additional lamellse are being formed in the walls of the Haversian canals. At the same time a hollowing out of spaces in their interior is going on, so that an increase in weight commensurate with their growth does not take place. The interstitial absorptive changes, whether occurring during growth or after growth is completed, are due, as KoUiker has shown, to the action of the many-nucleated colossal cells, or osteo-klasts, which line the walls of the spaces where absorption is going on. The development, modelling, and ultimate configuration of a bone are, therefore, as has been well expressed by Kolliker, the product of the formation of osseous tissue by the agency of the osteo-blasts, and of its absorption or destruction by the action of the osteo-klasts. Trom the fact that osseous tissue may be produced either in the cartilaginous or in the fibrous tissues, and that all three contribute to the formation of the skeleton, it is evident that these tissues are closely aUied. To express this aUiance they have aU been grouped together under the common term connective substances. MuscuLAE Tissue. _ The Muscular Tissue is that which is actively concerned either in the movement of parts of the body on each other, orm the movement of the entire body from place to place; It IS the active agent, therefore, both in motion and loco- M

25 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. and temporal bones, From its position, therefore, it binds together all the bones of the cranium, and, moreover, articulates with many of those of the face. For con- structive purposes it is the most important bone of the head. It consists of a centrum or body, with which four pairs of processes are connected. The body has a deep depression on its upper surface, compared in shape to a Turkish saddle, in which is lodged the pituitary body; hence it is called intuitary fossa. In front of this fossa is a ridge which marks the place of union of the pre- and fost-splienoiclal subdivisions of the body of this bone; the body is grooved laterally for the internal carotid artery and the cavernous blood sinuses, and it is hoUowed out in its interior to form the sphenoidal air-sinuses: these air- sinuses are partially closed in front by a pair of small bony plates called sphenoidal spongy hones, or bones of Bertin. Behind the pituitary fossa is a pair of processes caUed posterior clinoid, from which the bone slopes back to the basi-occipital; this slope is called the dorsum sellce, and on it rests the pons VaroUi. From the posterior part of each side of the body the great wings, or ali-sphenoids, pass outwards and upwards to the sides of the skull, and each sends off a plate-like process to enter into the formation of the outer wall of the orbit. From the anterior part of each side of the body the lesser wings, orhito-sphenoids, pass outwards, and assist in forming the roof of each orbit; each orbito-sphenoid ends internally in a knob-Hke process called anterior clinoid, and at its root is a foramen called optic, which transmits the second nerve, or nerve of sight, into the orbit. From the great wings on each side, close to Its junction with the body, a pair of pterygoid processes,

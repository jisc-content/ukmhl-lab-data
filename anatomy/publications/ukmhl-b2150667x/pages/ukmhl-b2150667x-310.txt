ANATOMY. 294 specialisation of form, position, and arrangement are not in themselves a sufficient test of specialisation of function. Again, though the convolutions have definite forms they are not disconnected from each other, for the grey matter forms a continuous layer over the whole surface of the hemisphere. Hence a group of cerebral convolutions differs from a group of muscles, each member of which is un- doubtedly a distinct organ, for each muscle is isolated from those around it by a definite investing sheath. As regards internal structure, evidence has abeady been given that all the convolutions are not constructed on precisely the same plan, and it has also been pointed out that the con- volutions are not aU connected in the same way with the great cerebral ganglia. These structural modifications un- questionably point to fvmctional differences in the several parts in which they are found. But further, special connections through the arcuate fibres are established between certain convolutions and not between others, and it is possible not only that particular combinations of convolutions through an interchange of internuncial fibres may condition a particular state of intellectual activity, but that these combinations associate various convolutions together in the performance of a given intellectual act, just as in the muscular system several muscles are as a rule associated together for the performance of a given move- ment. A clue to the special functions of the convolutions will doubtless be obtained by studying their connections with each other and with other parts of the encephalon, just as the action of the members of a group of muscles is ascertained by examining the direction of their fibres and the attachment of their terminal tendons.

INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 295 Variations within certain limits in the degree of com- plexity of arrangement of the convolutions are found in the human brain. The observations of Gratiolet and Marshall on the brains of women of the Bush race have shown that in them a greater simplicity of arrangement, due to the foldings of the surface being less numerous, prevails than in the average European brain. Again, the observations of Rudolph and Hermann Wagner on the brains of Gauss and Dirichlet, the eminent mathematicians, show that the convoluted surface was much more tortuous, and the superficial area of the convolutions was consider- ably greater than in the average European brain. From these and other data, it is evident that a complex arrange- ment of the convolutions may co-exist with high intellectual powers. But it must also be admitted that men of un- doubted intellectual ability have been found to possess brains in which the convolutions had no unusually com- plex arrangement. In endeavouring to form an estimate of the comparative value of the convolutions in different individuals, not only should the degree of tortuosity of the surface be inquired into, but the depth of the sulci, the thickness of the grey matter, and the qiiality of the tissue of which the convolutions are composed. A brain with deep sulci, conjoined with a thick layer of grey matter, but with comparatively simple gyri, might present as large a hemispherical ganglion as one the convolutions of which were more tortuous but less deep. Presumably that grey matter is the most active which contains the greatest proportion of nerve cells in a given area. From the structural point of view, one may say that those convolu- tions present the most complex organisation in which,

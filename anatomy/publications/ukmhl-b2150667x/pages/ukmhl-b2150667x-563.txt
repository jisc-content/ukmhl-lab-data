547 LYMPHATIC FOLLICLES. Fig. 147. — Retifoini connective tissue from a lymphatic gland, X 300. ing cells, the processes of which anastomose freely with each other, so as to form a network or reticulum of the retiform connective tissue (fig. 147). These cells are dis- tinctly nucleated. This reti- culum forms a sustentacular or supporting framework for the lymph corpuscles, which fill up the interstices of the mesh- work. When this lymphoid tissue is developed so abundantly in a locality as to form definite masses, or follicles, they usually possess a spheroidal or ovoid form, such as one sees in the solitary glands, in the individual glandules of aPeyer's patch, in the trachoma glands of the conjunctiva, the faucial and pharyngeal tonsils, and the Malpighian bodies of the spleen. At other times the tissue is not aggregated into masses, but is uniformly diffused throughout a particular locality, as is the case in the basis substance of the intestinal villi, in the interglandular connective tissue of the intestinal mucous membrane, and in the sheath and outer coat of the branches of the splenic artery. It not unfrequently happens, as in the tonsils and the conjunctival mucous membrane, that not only is the lymphoid tissue aggregated into definite masses or follicles, but that lymph corpuscles are infiltrated or dijBfused throughout the con- nective tissue, which surrounds the individual follicles.

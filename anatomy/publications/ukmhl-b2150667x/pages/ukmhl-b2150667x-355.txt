THE EYEBALL. 339 dark pigment granules; wMst in light-coloured eyes the stellate cells of the stroma are either devoid of pigment or only faintly coloured. The iris contains numerous fasciculi of involuntary or non-striped muscular fibre arranged in two dii-ections. Circularly arranged fibres surround the aperture of the pupil, and form the sphincter muscle, by the contraction of which the size of the pupU is diminished. Smooth muscular fibres also radiate from the pupdlary to the ciliary border of the iris and form the dilatator muscle. The muscular nature of these fibres in the human iris was long disputed, but was satisfactorily demonstrated in 1852 by Lister. Jeropheef has also described circular fascicuH smrounding the ciHaiy border. In birds and reptiles the muscular tissue of the iris consists of transversely striped fibres. The arteries of the iris arise from the circulus arteriosus, and run radiaUy forwards towards the pupil, where they anastomose and form the circulus iridis minor They possess relatively thick external and muscular coats. The capillaries form a plexus not so compact as that of the choroid coat. The veins of the iris end in the ven^ vorti- cose. In the foetus the pupH is closed in by a deHcate membrane, membrana pupillaris, into which the blood- vessels of the iris are prolonged. This membrane disap- pears by absorption during the later months of embryo life The nems of the middle coat of the eyebaU are the long cihary branches of the ophthalmic division of the 5th and the short ciliary branches of the cihary ganglion, ihey pzerce the sclerotic near the optic nerve, and run iorward m the lamina fusca of the choroid. They give off branches to the choroid which form in it a plexus in which H. Midler found nerve cells. From this plexus

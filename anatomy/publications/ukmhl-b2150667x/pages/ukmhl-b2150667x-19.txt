INXKODUCTION. 3 considering the alterations or disturbance of the functions of parts in the course of disease. To describe the anatomy of the multitudinous forms of animal life from these dif- ferent points of view ivould require, not one, but several voluminous treatises, and would much exceed the compass of this volume, which is intended to be devoted more particularly to the description of the Special Anatomy of the Human Body in a state of health; in other words, to be a short treatise on Human Anatomy or Anthkopotomy. As forming a department of the general science of Com- parative Anatomy, the anatomy of Man is interesting not oidy to men of science generally, but, from its intimate con- nection with the several divisions of the art of healing, and with the study of the functions of the human body, possesses the highest importance to the physician, surgeon, and physiologist. SPECIAL ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BODY. Man, zoologically speaking, belongs to the Mammalian class of the Vertebrate sub-kingdom, i.e., his young are brought forth alive, and nourished during infancy on milk secreted in mammary or milk-forming glands. In common with all vertebrate organisms, he possesses a spine or verte- bral column and a skull, in which are contained the brain and the spinal marrow, and on the ventral surface of the spinal column are situated the several subdivisions of the alimentary canal. But man possesses certain special or distinctive anatomi- cal characters. The most noticeable, as seen on an external inspection of his body, is his erect position. He is.

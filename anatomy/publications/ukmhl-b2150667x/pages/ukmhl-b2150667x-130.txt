114 ANATOMY, given the general name of a Cytode. Sometimes a cytode is a naked clump of soft protoplasm, -without a trace of differentiation either on its surface or in its substance, as in the freely-moving Monera; at others the peripheral part of the cytode hardens, and differentiates into a more or less perfect envelope, as in the genera Protomonas and Protomyxa. So far back as 1861, Lionel Beale had de- scribed, under the name of germinal matter {Bioplasm), minute Hving particles of vegetable protoplasm, and in 1863 he demonstrated the presence of extremely minute particles of living matter in the blood. More recently Strieker has also called attention, in the bodies of the hio-her animals, to minute detached clumps of protoplasm which exhibited the phenomena of Ufe. As a rule, however, in both vegetable and animal organisms the specks or clumps of protoplasm assume definite shapes, and show evidence of an internal difi'erentiation. In the midst of a minute clump of this substance a sharply- defined body called a nucleus is found, which differs from the surrounding proto- plasm in not being contractile; and some- times a minute speck, or nucleolus, exists within the nucleus.

Cells are definite anatomical and physiological units, and exhibit all the phenomena of life. Some of the lowest organisms consist merely of a sin-le ceU, others of two or more ceUs united together,

ANATOMY. 24 and 7), consists of four originally distinct pieces fused into a curved plate-like bone. Its subdivisions are arranged around the foramen magnum â€” the basilar part, basi- occipital, in front; the condyloid parts, ex-occipitals, one on each side; and the tabular part, or supra-occipital, behind. The anterior surface of the supra-occipital is sub-divided into four fossse, in the two upper of which are lodged the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, in the two lower the cere- bellum ; the upper and lower pairs of fossse are separated by a transverse groove for the lodgment of the lateral venous sinus. The posterior surface is marked by a pro- tuberance and by two curved lines for the attachment of muscles; by its margin the supra-occipital articulates with the parietal and temporal bones. Each ex-occipital has on its under surface a smooth condyle for articulation with the atlas; in froiit of the condyle is a foramen which transmits the last or ninth cranial nerve, called hypoglossal, and behind it a foramen for the transmission of a vein sometimes exists. The basi-occipital articulates and, in the adult skuU, is fused with the body of the sphenoid (Fig. 7). The upper surface of the basi-occipital is grooved for the lodgment of the meduUa oblongata. Sometimes the part of the supra-occipital situated above the protuberance and upper curved line ossifies as an inde- pendent bone, called interparietal. In some mammals, as the sheep, the existence of an interparietal in the young skuU is the rule and not the exception. The Sphenoid or Wedge-shaped bone (Fig. 7) lies at the base of the skuU; it articulates behind -with the occipital; in front it is jointed to the ethmoid and frontal, and by its lateral processes or wings to the frontal, parietal,

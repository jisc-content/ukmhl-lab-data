STRUCTUEE OF LUNGS. 641 part distributed to the lympliatic glands, connective tissue, and the walls of the great vessels at the root of the lung: in part it accompanies the bronchial tube, and breaks up into small arteries, which end in a capillary plexus for the supply of the bronchial mucous membrane and the race- mose glands connected with it; in part it is distributed to the interlobular and sub-serous connective tissue. The capillaries which supply the finer bronchi communicate with the pulmonary capillary plexus, and with some root- lets of the pulmonary vein, so that this plexus and the pulmonary veins can be injected from the bronchial artery. Some years ago I miecteA a supplemmtar^/set ohiutrient arteries for the lungs, consisting of fine branches of the internal mammary and intercostal arteries, which formed an extra-pleural plexus under the mediastinal pleura, and then passed to the lung, both in front of and behind the root, as well as between the folds of the ligamentum latum pul- monis. Having reached the lung, some of these branches entered its substance along with the bronchial tube, whilst others ramified in the sub-serous connective tissue. The extra-pleural plexus keeps up an anastomosis between the arteries of the lung and those of the thoracic wall. The bronchial vein is situated at the root of the lung, and receives venules corresponding to branches of the bronchial artery distributed to both the superficial and deep parts of the lung. It does not, however, convey all the blood which the bronchial artery has carried into the lung, as that artery also communicates through its capil- laries with the pulmonary veins. The lym2Jhatics of the lung are arranged in a superficial and deep set. The

ANATOMY. 282 to trace out tlie course of the nerve fibres in tlie organ, and though, our knowledge is by no means complete, yet many important facts have undoubtedly been ascertained. These facts have been summarised, and numerous additions made to them by Meynert in a recent elaborate memoir pub- lished in Strieker's Hanclbuch der Gewebelehre. The Grey Matter of the cerebrum is disposed in three great groups : a, The grey matter of the cortex of the hemi- spheres ; 6, the grey matter of the great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum; c, the central grey matter which forms the wall of the cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube. a, The grey matter of the cortex of the hemisphere forms the superficial part of the convolutions, and is known as the great hemispherical ganglion, but in some locahties, as at the loci perforati antici and the' septum lucidum, it has received distinctive names. When a convolution is divided vertically the grey matter is seen to be confined to the surface and to enclose a white core. The grey matter presents a laminated appearance, and as a rule consists of five or six layers, which are composed of the characteristic pyramidal nerve cells of the cortex of the cerebrum, of nerve fibres, of matrix or neuroglia, and of blood-vessels. The most superficial layer consists of neuroglia, in which nerve fibres extend parallel to the surface of the convolutions. In the deeper layers are found the pyramidal nerve cells, which He with their long axes vertical to the surface of the convolutions, and which contain well-marked nuclei. From the observations of Lockhart Clarke, Arndt, Cleland, and Meynert, there can be no doubt that the pyramidal nerve ceUs vary in relative size and in numbers in the different layers of the grey cortex, and that the largest sized pyra-

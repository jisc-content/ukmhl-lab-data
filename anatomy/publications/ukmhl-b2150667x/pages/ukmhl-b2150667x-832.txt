ANATOMY. 816 the membranous part of tlie uretlira. It is nearly half an inch wide about the middle of the prostate, somewhat less where it opens into the bladder, and about a quarter of an inch in width at the apex of the gland, but it is capable of being more widely distended under pressure. It lies in front of the middle lobe of the prostate, and nearer its anterior than posterior surface. It is lined by a mucous mem- brane, which forms at the opening into the bladder a transverse fold, the uvula vesicae. In front of the uvula a longitudinal fold about ^ inch long, and ^th of an inch in its greatest height, extends forwards along the floor of the prostatic part of the urethra; it is called colliculus seminalis, or verumontanum, or crest of the urethra. On each side of this crest is a longitudinal depression, the prostatic sinus, into which many of the ducts of the glands of the prostate open. At the summit of the crest are three minute orifices, a mesial and two lateral: the mesial is the mouth of the prostatic vesicle, the lateral are the openings of the common ejaculatory ducts. The free surface of the colliculus is formed by the mucous lining of the urethra, beneath which, as Henle has shown, is a network of elastic fibres .with interspersed non-striped muscle; cavernous tissue, capable of erection, occupies the spaces of this network. The vesicula prostatica, or utricidus, or uterus masculinus, is a pouch from \to ^ inch long, which opens by a narrow slit on the middle of the summit of the colliculus seminalis. It inclines backwards and upwards, between the lateral lobes, and below the middle lobe of the prostate, and though dilat- ing somewhat in its course terminates in a cul-de-sac at its posterior free end. It is lined by a mucous membrane, covered by a stratified pavement epithelium, and its wall

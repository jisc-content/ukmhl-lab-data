ANATOMY. 198 favour of the existence of the axial cylinder as a normal constituent of the fibre, and of its functional importance. Nerve Cells.â€”Nerve cells constitute an important division of the nervous tissue. They are the characteristic structures in the nerve centres, are susceptible to impressions, or nervous impulses, and are the texture in which the molecular changes occur that produce or disengage the special form of energy named nerve energy, the evolution of which is the distinc- tive mark of a nerve centre. The central extremities of the nerve fibres lie in relation to, and are often directly con- tinous with, the nerve cells. It was at one time thought that nerve cells were globular in form; but it is now gene- rally understood that, though the body of the cell is not unfrequently globular, two or more processes or poles project from it, and are continuous with its substance. Nerve cells are distinctly nucleated; the nuclei are usually large, and contain one, and often two nucleoli. The cell substance is gi-anular and fibrillated, and not unfrequently brown or yellow pigment is collected around the nucleus. A cell wall is sometimes apparently present, though at others it cannot be demonstrated. The nerve cells in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord are imbedded in the neuroglia. In the smaUer nerve centres, as the sympathetic ganglia and the gangha on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the nerve cells are surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Frantzel, Kolliker, and others, have described this capsule as lined by an endothelium fonned of flattened cells. Nerve cells from which two poles or processes proceed are caUed Upolar. Characteristic specimens of these ceUs, as was first pointed out by Robin and E. Wagner, may be

629 THE LUNGS. pleura. The bulk of tte upper lobe is placed in the clavi- cular, infra-clavicular, mammary, axillary, and scapular regions. The middle lobe of the right lung is in the right mammary region. The lower lobe of each lung is in the infra-mamm-xry, infra-axillary, scapular, and infra-scapular regions. The anterior border of each lung overlaps the front of the pericardium, and extends into both the upper and lower sternal regions, but the anterior border of the left lung does not pass so far into the lower sternal region as the corresponding border of the right lung. The posterior borders of the two lungs lie in the interscapular region, During inspiration the anterior border passes further forwards into the upper and lower sternal regions than during expiration, and the base of each lung, with the descent of the diaphragm, extends further down into the infra-mammary, infra-axillary, and infra-scapular regions. As the base of the lungs rests on the diaphragm they are necessarily brought into relation, through that muscle, with viscera situated in the costal zone of the abdomen; thus the right lung is in relation to the liver, and the left lung to the liver, stomach, and spleen. The Root of the lung is composed of the important structures, which pass into, or emerge from, the interior of the lung. It consists of the large air tube, or bronchus, of the pulmonary artery, and the pulmonary veins, the bronchial artery and bronchial vein, the pulmonary nerves, the pulmonary lymphatic vessels, and the bronchial lym- phatic glands. The bronchus is placed at the back of the root of each lung; in the root of the right lung it is the highest object, but in the root of the left lung it lies below the pulmonary artery. It is accompanied by the bronchial

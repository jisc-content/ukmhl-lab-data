ANATOMY. 132 of the localities where this membrane was theoretically sup- posed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated ; and it is probable that the tissue on which the epithelium rests is only a somewhat condensed form of the sub-epithe- lial connective tissue, which assumes in some localities a membrane-like appearance. The recent observations of H. Watney, indeed, show that, in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, a delicate retic\d.um of connective tissue is prolonged between the epithelial cells. The corium is also the seat of numerous glands, with their blood and lymph vessels and nerves; and the epithelial hniug of the glands is continuous at their orifices with the epithelial in- vestment of the corium. The surface both of the mucous membranes and skia is usually more or less undulated— sometimes it is thrown into strong folds or rugae, at others it is elevated into minute, frequently conical, processes, named in some locaHties papillae, in others villi; but in all these cases the epithelium is prolonged as a continuous cover- ing over the undulating free surface. The free surface of all mucous membranes is kept moist by the secretion or mucus which lubricates it. Tessellated, pavement, scaly, or squamoiis epithelium is .situ- ated on the free surface of the mucous lining of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, vestibular entrance to the nose, ocular conjunctiva, and entrance to the Fig 30 —Scaly epithelium from the urethra and vagina. It forms mucous membrane of tlie moutli. * 4.1,„ under the special name of the horny layer of the cuticle or epidermis, the superficial in-

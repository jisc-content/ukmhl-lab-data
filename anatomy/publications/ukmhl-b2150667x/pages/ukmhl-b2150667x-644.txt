628 ANATOMY. Smaller than the lower lobe, and, from tlie direction of tlie oblique fissure, lies both above and in front of it. The apex and the whole, or the greater part, of the anterior border belong to the upper lobe: the greater part of the posterior border and of the base to the lower lobe. In the right lung a second fissure, which does not exist in the left lung, is also present. It commences at the oblique fissure, runs almost horizontally forwards to the anterior border of the lung, and separates the lower part of the upper lobe as a distinct lobe, called the third or middle lobe of the right lung. The right lung is still further distinguished from the left by being more hol- lowed out at its base, owing to the arch formed by the right half of the diaphragm being higher than that of the left, so that the vertical diameter of the right is not so long as that of the left lung. But the transverse diameter of the right lung is more than that of the left, for the greater projection of the heart and pericardium, to the left than to the right of the mesial plane, causes the medi- astinal surface of the left lung to be more concave than the corresponding surface of the right lung. The anterior border of the right lung is much more nearly straight than that of the left, in which this border presents a semilunar notch below the level of the fourth rib, which corresponds to the position of the heart. .; The lungs have extensive relations to the walls of the chest, and even to structures at the root of the neck. The apex of each lung lies in the supra-clavicular and supra- scapular regions, and is marked by a slight groove cor- responding to the position of the subclavian artery, from ."which it is separated by the cervical prolongation of the

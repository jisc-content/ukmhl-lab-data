ANATOMY. 166 observers bone-corpHScles. But if a little turpentine be added to tlie section, the fluid displaces tlie air which the lacunae and canaliculi contain in the dried bone, renders the part more transparent, and affords a satisfac- tory demonstration that they are, in a macerated and drj bone, not solid bodies, but a minute system of spaces and anastomosing little canals; and that all those which lie in the same Haversian system not only freely communicate with each other, but, either directly or indirectly, with the Haversian canal which they surround. But a macerated and dried bone, such as one sees in museums and in articulated skeletons, and the structure of which has just been described, is a bone which has been deprived of several soft tissues by the pro- ^fe cess of putrefaction, which tis- sues are of the utmost importance H intheeconomyof theboneinthe , ,. living animal.

It is essential, therefore, in studying the structure of bone, that the attention should not be limited to the appearances pre- sented by the macerated bone, but that the arrangement and structure of its soft tissues should be considered. The soft tissues of a bone are the periosteum and its prolonga- tions, the marrow, the minute masses of nucleated pro- toplasm which occupy the lacunae of the bone, the blood and lymph vessels, and the nerves. The Periosttum is a strong fibrous membrane which

THE EYEBALL. 347 ophthalraic vein or directly into the cavernous sinus. The veins and capillaries of the retina have been described by His as completely invested by perivascular lymphatic sheaths, whilst the arteries only possess such sheaths for a limited part of their course. These lymphatics leave the eyeball along with the bundles of the optic nerve through the lamina cribrosa in the sclerotic. The Optic Nerve itself passes from the orbit through the optic foramen into the cranial cavity, where it arises from the optic commissure. This commissure is a flattened band formed by the junction of the two optic tracts. Each tract winds backwards at the outer side of the tuber cinereum and eras cerebri to arise from the optic thalamus, corpora quad- rigemina and geniculata; some observers also state that it derives fibres from the tuber cinereum and lamina cinerea. In the commissure an interchange takes place between the fibres of opposite nerves and tracts, so that not only does an optic nerve contain fibres derived from the tract on its own side, but from the opposite tract, and it has even been stated that fibres pass across the commissure from one optic nerve to the other, and from one optic tract to the other. THE KEFEACTING MEDIA. The Aqueous Humour ia a limpid watery fluid, containing a little common salt in solution, which occupies the space between the cornea and the front of the crystalline lens, In this space the iris lies, and imperfectly divides it into two chambers, an anterior and a posterior, which commu- nicate with each other through the pupil. The anterior chamber, of some size, is situated between the iris and

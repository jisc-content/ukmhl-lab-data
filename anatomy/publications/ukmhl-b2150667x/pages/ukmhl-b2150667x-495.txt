479 POPLITEAL ARTERY, tlie back of tlie limb by a considerable interval. To its outer side in the upper half of the space is the biceps, and in the lower half the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the plantaris. It enters the space by passing in front of the semi-membranosus, and then has that muscle with the semi-tendinosus to its inner side in the upper half of the space, and the inner head of the gastronemius in its lower half : as the two heads of the gastrocnemius approach each other at the lower angle of the space they overlap the artery. The popliteal vein lies immediately posterior to the artery, at its upper part being a little to its outer side, at its lower part a little to its inner side. The internal popliteal nerve is also posterior to the artery, but nearer to ' the surface of the region ; like the vein it is at first some- what external, but in the lower part of the region it lies to the inner side of the artery. The branches of the popliteal artery are distributed to the knee joint, to the muscles around it, and to the skin of the popliteal space. a. Superior Muscular pass to the lower end of the ham- string muscles. 6. Inferior Muscular or Sural, to the heads of the gastrocnemius and to the plantaris. c. Superior Internal Articular turns round the femur above the inner condyle, and under cover of the adductor magnus tendon and the inner hamstrings, to reach the inner side of the knee. d. Superior External Articular turns round the femur immediately above the outer condyle, and under cover of the biceps to reach the outer side of the knee. e. Inferior Internal Articular runs inwards below the

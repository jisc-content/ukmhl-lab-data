THE TONGUE. 381 cleated spindles, which, arranged in layers, form the enve- lope of each gustatory bulb, and reach from the bottom to the mouth of the flask; they enclose the gustatory cells. The gustatory ceUs are attenuated, homogeneous, and highly refractile cells, which possess an elliptical nucleated body with two processes, a central and peripheral. These cells occupy the axis of the gustatory bulb. The peri- pheral process, broader than the central, sometimes ends in a short hair-like tip, which almost reaches the gus- tatory pore; the central process extends to the base of the flask, and often divides into small branches. This process is varicose, and not unlike the axial cylinder of a nerve fibre. The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which are distributed to the back of the tongue, enter the circumvaUate papiH^, and form a minute plexns, with groups of nerve ceUs interspersed in it, from which bundles both of medullated and non-medullated fibres pass to the basis of the gustatory bulbs; and it is believed that the^ finest non-meduUated fibres are continuous with the peripheral processes of the gustatory ceUs, which are there- fore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the nerve of taste, and by the excitation of these bodies gustative or taste sensations are produced. As the glosso-pharyngeal IS the nerve distributed to the circumvaUate papiH^, where these gustatory bulbs are especiaUy found, it is therefore the special nerve of taste; but as these bulbs have also been sparingly seen in the other papillae, where the Ungual nerve is distributed, that nerve probably acts in a minor degree as a nerve of taste, though its special function is undoubtedly that of a nerve of touch. The gustatory bulbs are not penetrated by blood-vessels, but, as Fig. 112

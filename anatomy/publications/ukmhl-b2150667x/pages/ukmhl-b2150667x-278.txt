262 ANATOMY. Its inner surface, which forms the sides of the longitudinal fissure, is flat and is separated from the opposite hemi- sphere by the falx cerebri. Its under surface, where it rests on the tentorium, is concave, and is separated by that membrane from the cerebellum and pons. From the front of the pons two strong white bands, the crura cereh-i or cere- bral peduncles, pass forwards and upwards to enter the optic thalami in their respective hemispheres. Winding round the outer side of each eras is a flat white band, the o2ytic tract. These tracts converge in front, and join to form the 02Jtic commissure, from which the two oj^tic nerves arise. The crura cerebri, optic tracts, and optic commissure enclose a lozenge-shaped space, which includes from behind for- wardsâ€”a, a grey layer, caUed pons Tarini, which, from being perforated by several smaU arteries, is often called locus perfm-atus posticus; h, two white mammillae, the cor- pora alUcantia; c, a grey nodule, the tuber dnereum, from which, d, the infundibulum projects to join the pituitary body. Immediately in front of the optic commissure is a grey layer, the lamina cinerea or lamina terminalis of the 3d ventricle; and between the optic commissure and the inner end of each Sylvian fissure is a grey spot perforated by smaU arteries, the locus perforatus anticus. The peripheral part of each hemisphere, which consists of grey matter, exhibits a characteristic folded appearance, known as the convolutions or gyri of the cerebram. These convolutions are separated from each other by fissures or ^Ici, some of which are considered to subdivide the hemi- sphere into lobes, whilst others separate the convolutions in each lobe from each other. In each hemisphere of the human brain five lobes are recognised: the temporo-sphe-

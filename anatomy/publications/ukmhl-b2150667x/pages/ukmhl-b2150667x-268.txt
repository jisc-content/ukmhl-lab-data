AIJATOMY. 252 nerve cells of the olive are multipolar and flask-shaped, and in aU probability give origin to the nerve fibres proceeding from the interior of the capsule. Separated from the inner part of the olive by a layer of reticular substance is a smaller grey mass, called by Stilling the nuclem of the accessory olive. Crossing the anterior surface of the mediilla oblongata, immediately below the pons, in the majority of mammals is a transverse arrangement of fibres forming the irapezium, which contains a grey nucleus, named by Van der KoUc the sujjerior olive. In the human brain the trapezium is included within the lower transverse fibres of the pons, but when sections are made through it, as L. Clarke pointed out, the grey matter of the superior olive can be seen. Meynert states that its nerve cells give origin to some fibres, which run straight backwards to the restiform body of the same side, and to others which pass across the mesial plane to the opposite corpus restiforme. PONS. The Pons Yaholii or Bridge (Figs. 78, 94), is cuboidal in form: its anterior surface rests upon the dorsum seUae of the sphenoid bone, and is marked by a median longitudinal groove; its inferior surface receives the pyra- midal and olivary tracts of the medulla oblongata; at its superior surface are the two crura cerebri; each lateral surface is in relation to a hemisphere of the cerebellum, and a peduncle passes from the pons into the interior of each hemisphere; the posterior surface forms in part the upper portion of the floor of the 4th ventricle, and in part is in contact with the corpora quadrigemina. The pons consists of white and grey matter. The nerve

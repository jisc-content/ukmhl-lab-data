CHAPTEE VIII. THE LAEYNX, OE OEGAN OF VOICE. The Larynx, or Organ of Voice, is the upper end of the windpipe, which, whilst performing the function of a respiratory tube, is especially modified in its construction for the production of the voice. The larynx lies in the middle of the anterior part of the neck, in front of the pharynx, and immediately below the hyoid bone. It passes downwards to opposite the body of the sixth cervical vertebra, where it becomes con- tinuous with the trachea. It is covered by the sterno- hyoid, sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and omo-hyoid muscles, cervical fascia and skin; and the lateral lobes of the thyroid body, with the upper ends of the two common carotid arteries, lie at its sides. It forms a tube, the wall of which is composed of a framework of cartilages, jointed together and movable on each other by the action of special muscles. Within the tube are the vocal cords, by the vibrations of which the .voice is produced. It is lined by a glandular mucous membrane, and is supplied by blood-vessels and nerves.

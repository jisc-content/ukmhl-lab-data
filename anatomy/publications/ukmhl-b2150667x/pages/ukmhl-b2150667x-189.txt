So long as any cartilage remains in a foetal or young bone the process of replacement of the cartilaginous tissue by the proper osseous tissue goes on, until none of the cartilage is left, except the thin layer of encrusting cartH- age at each articular extremity. Bones grow in length by an ossification in cartilage; and a provision for their longitudinal increase is furnished up to, and even beyond the age of puberty, by the plate of cartilage which separ-

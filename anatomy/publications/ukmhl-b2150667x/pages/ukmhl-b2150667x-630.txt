614 ANATOMY. region. The right ventricle corresponds to the lower sternal region, but on the one side passes slightly into the right mammary region, and on the other more extensively into the left mammary. The right auricle is also in the right mammary and lower sternal regions, but the left auricle and ventricle correspond to the left mammary region. The vertical diameter of the cardiac region is from the level of the upper border of the third pair of costal carti- lages to that of the sixth pair; its transverse diameter is from a line somewhat internal to the left nipple to a finger's breadth to the right of the sternum. The relations of the aortic and auriculo-ventricular openings to the wall of the chest has already been given on p. 407. It may further be stated, that the relation of the heart to the walls of the thorax varies slightly with the position of the body, with the quantity of blood in the heart, and with the stage of the respiratory process. In a full inspiration the heart is depressed about haK an inch, owing to the descent of the diaphragm. The Windpipe. The Windpipe is the tube which transmits the' atmo- spheric air from the pharynx into the lungs. It is divided into the larynx, the trachea, and the two bronchi. As the larynx has been described in Chapter VIII., the trachea and bronchi now require description. The Trachea is situated in the middle of the anterior part of the neck, and in the upper part of the back of the thoracic mediastinum. It is continous above with the

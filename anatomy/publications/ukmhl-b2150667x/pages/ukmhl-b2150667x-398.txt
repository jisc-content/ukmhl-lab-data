Key, Beale, and other observers have described special modifications of the epithelium in connection with the terminations of the gusta- tory nerves in the frog. The mucous membrane of the tongue contains numerous small tubular or branched glands, more especially on the dorsum near its root, which secrete mucus. Depressions also occur in this part of the mucous membrane, around the walls of which groups of lymphoid cells are collected in the sub-epithelial connective tissue, which have an arrangement closely resembling the structure of the adjacent tonsils, and form an example of adenoid tissue. The tongue arises as a bud-like process on the floor of the mouth of the embryo. It consists of tnesoblast covered by the epiblast layer which lines the buccal chamber. From the epiblast is produced the epithelial covering, and in all probability the gustatory bulbs, whilst the mesoblast gives rise to the muscular, fibrous, vascular, and nervous structures. The Skin. The Skin, or Integument, invests the entire outer surface of the body, and contains structures by -the excitation of which the properties of things are determined by the sense of touch. The skin also contains accessory stractures, as the nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The skin consists of a non-vascular cuticle or epidermis, and of a vascular and sensitive corium, or cutis vera. The Cuticle, Epidermis, or scarf skin, forms the outer

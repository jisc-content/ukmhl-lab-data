THE EAE. 371 arranged in two groups, an inner and an outer. The cells of the inner group rest by a broad foot on the inner part of the basilar membrane, close to its attachment to the spii-al lamina, project obliquely forwards and outwards, and expand into a dilated head : the cells of the outer group also rest by a broad foot on the same membrane, incline forwards and inwards, and fit into a depression in the head of the cells of the inner group : these two groups of cells form the rods or pillars ofCorti, and by their juxtaposition arch over an excessively minute canal enclosed between them and the basilar membrane, which may be named the canal of Gorti. The inner rods are, however, more numerous than the outer, and Pritchard has shown that the rods increase in length from the base to the apex of the cochlea. Immediately internal and almost paraUel to the inner group of these rods, and adjacent therefore to the crista spiralis, is a row of compressed conical cells, which possess at their anterior ends short stiff hair-like processes; they are the inner hair cells of Deiters. Immediately external and â– almost paraUel to the outer group of rods are four or five rows of hair ceUs, the outer hair cells, which are attached by their bases to the basilar membrane, whilst from the opposite extremity a brush of hairs projects through the reticular membrane. The outer hair ceUs are, according to Waldeyer, relatively of large size in man. The reticular membrane of KoUiker is a delicate framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends parallel to the basilar mem- brane from the inner rods of Corti to the external row of outer hair ceUs, and through the holes in it the hairs of the outer hair cells project. It obviously acts as a support for the anterior ends of these cells, and binds together these

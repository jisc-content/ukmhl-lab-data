INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 509 clavian vein : after it has pierced tlie fascia, it receives the mprascaptilar and transversalis colli veins corresponding to those branches of the subclavian artery. A bisegmented valve occurs in the course of the external jugular vein, and a similar valve at its junction with the subclavian. J. Struthers has shown that the transversalis colli and supra- scapular veins possess valves,but not the anterior jugular: also that no valves occur in the subclavian vein, except immediately external to the point of entrance of the ex- ternal jugular; but at the junction with the brachio-cephalic vein a two segmented valve is found. The Interkal Jugular vein is the large vein which collects the blood from the brain, the face, and certain parts of the neck. It begins at the jugular foramen, where it is continuous with the lateral cranial blood sinus in the dura mater, and descends to the outer side of the internal carotid and the common carotid arteries, but within the same sheath; behind the inner end of the clavicle, it joins the subclavian vein, to form the brachio-cephalic vein. J, Struthers has described a bi-segmented valve as constantly present, either at or close to the mouth of the internal jugular vein. It receivesâ€” a. The Facial vein, which runs down the side of the face, posterior to and a little distance from the facial artery, and enters the internal jugular a little below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle : the facial vein is joined by the veins which correspond to the branches of the facial artery, as well as by i^Q frontal vein from the forehead. A communicating vein connects the facial with the temporal veins, and, in cases where the external jugular vein is small, allows the blood from the veins,

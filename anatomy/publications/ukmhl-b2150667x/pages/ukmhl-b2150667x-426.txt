ANATOMY. 410 the wall. Owing to these connections the substance of the wall of the ventricle, as Henle's dissections show, may, with the exception of the superficial internal and superficial external fibres, be split up into lamellae, which extend either horizontally, obliquely, or in an arched manner through the wall between its two surfaces; and the surfaces of those lamellae are not parallel to the wall of the ven- tricle, but are directed upwards and downwards. The connective tissue of the heart is only small in quan- tity between the muscular fasciculi. At the base of the ventricles it is collected in a ring-like arrangement around the auriculo-ventricular and arterio-ventricular openings, and forms the auriculo-ventricular and arterial fibrous rings. These rings are in part composed of a tissue resembling white fibro-cartilage and in part of elastic fibres. In some animals, as the ruminants, a bone, the os cordis, is developed in the interval between the aortic and auriculo- ventricular openings. The rings give origin to some of the muscular fibres of the ventricles and auricles, and send bundles of fibrous tissue into the auriculo-ventricular and aortic valves, whilst the arterial rings are prolonged into the middle coats of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Owing to the close relation between the base of the anterior cusp of the mitral orifice and the aortic orifice, the fibrous rings of these two openings become blended together. The endocardium consists of connective tissue and elastic fibres, with a layer of endothelium on the free surface; and Schweigger-Seidel has also described smooth muscular fibres in it. Hence, as Luschka has stated, the endocardium represents not merely the inner coat of the blood-vessels but all the structures of the vascular wall. Purkinje de-

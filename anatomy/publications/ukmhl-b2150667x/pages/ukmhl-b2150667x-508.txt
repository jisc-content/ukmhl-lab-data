AN.A.TOMY, 492 secondary channels for conveying the blood to the lower limb when the external iliac artery is tied. In the sub- stance of the thigh, more especially in the hamstring and adductor magnus muscles, the several perforating branches of the profunda anastomose with each other, with the circumflex branches of the profunda, with the comes nervi ischiatici branch of the sciatic, and with the superior muscular branches of the popliteal. These anastomoses enlarge and form secondary channels when the femoral artery is tied. Around the knee joint the five articular branches of the popliteal anastomose with each other, with the anastomotic branch of the femoral, with the descending branch of the external circumflex, and with the recurrent articular branch of the anterior tibial. In the front of the leg the muscular branches of the anterior tibial anastomose with each other. In the back of the leg the muscular branches of the posterior tibial and peroneal inosculate with each other, and the communicating branch of the peroneal with the posterior tibial. Around the ankle joint the internal and external malleolar branches of the anterior tibial inosculate with the anterior perforating and terminal branches of the peroneal, and with the tarsal branch of the dorsal artery of the foot. In the foot itself the dorsal artery inosculates with the external plantar artery to form the plantar arterial arch; its tarsal and metatarsal branches inosculate not only with each other, but at the outer border of the foot with the marginal branches of the external â–  plantar, and at the inner border of the foot with the mar- ginal branches of the internal plantar artery. The per- forating branches of the plantar arch inosculate with the interosseous and digital branches of the metatarsal arte-

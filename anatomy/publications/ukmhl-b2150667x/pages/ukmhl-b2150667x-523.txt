SUBCLAVIAN VEIN". 507 brachial veins to form the axillary vein. The communi- cations between the superficial and^ deep veins are not, however, confined to the pointof termination of the former, but occur at various parts of their course, more especially at the bend of the elbow, where a deep median vein con- nects the median with the deep veins of the fore-arm. The deep veins of the hand commence at the tips of the fingers, and pass as digital veins on the sides of the fingers to the palm of the hand, in which two venous arches, corresponding to the arterial arches of the palm, are situated; from these arches the veins extend upwards along the front of the fore-arm, as far as the bend of the elbow; two veins closely accompanying each of the arteries of the fore-arm, and receiving numerous small veins correspond- ing to the branches of these arteries. At the bend of the elbow two brachial veins result from the junction of the deep radial and deep ulnar veins of the fore-arm. The brachial veins pass up the inner side of the upper arm, closely accompanying the brachial artery as far as the arm-pit, where they join to form, along with the superficial basilic vein, a single large axillary vein : they receive in their course small veins which correspond to the branches of the brachial artery. The Axillary vein is a large vessel which ascends to the inner or thoracic side of the axillary artery, and passes behmd the clavicle and the subclavius muscle, to become the subclavian vein, It receives not only the veins which correspond to the branches of the axillary artery, but, just before passing behind the subclavius muscle, it is joined by the superficial cephalic vein. Valves occur in it and in the other veins in the upper limb.

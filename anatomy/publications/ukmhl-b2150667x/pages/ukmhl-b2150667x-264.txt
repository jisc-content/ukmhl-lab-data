ANATOMY. 248 into three parts: a, some fibres form tlie arciform fibres and join the restiform body; b, others assist in the for- mation of the olivary fasciculus; c, others are prolonged upwards in the anterior pyramid of the same side (Fig. 78). The anterior pyramid consists partly of fibres of the anterior column of the cord of the same side, partly of decus- sating fibres of the ante- rior commissure, partly of decussating fibres from the posterior co- lumns and posterior cor- FiG. 78.—Diagrammatic dissection of the Me- r mattpr but dnllaOWongata and Pons to sliowtlie course HU 01 grey mattei, uuu of tlie fitres. a, superficial, a', deep transverse „„• „• .n^ of tlip rlpfllS- fibres of the pons; b, b, anterior pyramids principally 01 tUe OCCUS ascending at 6' through the pons; c, c, olivary .. n-f fhplti+prnl hodies; c', olivary fasciculus in the pons; sating nbreS01 tUelateral d, d, anterior columns of cord; c, inner part „^ ^v^r^rAc^fo of the right column joining the anterior COlumn 01 tUe OppOSlie pyramid; /, the outer pait going to tlie olivary fasciculus; lateral column of cord; gide 01 tJie COra. ine ft, the part which decussates at i, the decussa- . tion of the pyramids; I, the part which joins fibres of the anterior the restiform body ; m, that which forms the fasciculus teres; n, arciform fibres, land 2, -nyramid are prolonged sensory and motor roots of fifth nerve; U ■, 3, sixth nerve; 4, portio dura; 5, portio +ljroueh the POUS tO the intermedia; 6, portio mollis of seventh nerve; & i 7,glosso-pharyngeal; 8 pneumo-gastric; 9, gerel^rum.

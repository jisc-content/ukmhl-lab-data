46 ANATOMY. is attached. From the aceta- bulum the ilium extends up- wards and backwards, the ischium downwards and back- wards, the pubis forwards and H inwards. In front of the aceta- bulum is a large hole, the obturatw or thyroid foramen, which is bounded by the ischium and pubes; behind the acetabulum is the deep sciatic notch, which is bounded by the ischium and ilium. The Ilium (Fig. 10) in man is a broad plate-Uke bone. In its most simple form, as in the kangaroo, it is a three- sided, prismatic, rod-like bone, one end of which enters into the formation of the acetabu- lum, whilst the other is free, and forms the iliac crest. In man, notwithstanding its ex- panded form, three surfaces may also be recognised, cor- responding to the surfaces in theUiumof the kangaroo; and, as in that animal, the lower end Fig 11-The Appendicular Skeleton of the Left Lower Limb.

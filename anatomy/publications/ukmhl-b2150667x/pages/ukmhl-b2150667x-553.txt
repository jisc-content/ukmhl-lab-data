LYMPHATICS OF ABDOMEN. 537 tliey have numerous iliac lympatic glands connected with them. They ascend alongside of the aorta and inferior vena cava, passing through numerous lumbar lym-phatic glands in their course, diminish in number but increase in size, and opposite the second lumbar vertebra unite to form the commencement of the thoracic duct. The iliac and lumbar lymphatic glands receive numerous lymph-vessels from the pelvic walls, the iliac fossÂ£e, and the muscles of the loins. The Lymphatics of the Abdominal Viscera proceed from the stomach, spleen, pancreas, liver, supra-renal capsules, kidneys, bladder, prostate gland, vesiculsE seminales and testicles, and in the female from the ovaries, uterus, and vagma. In the hollow viscera, as the stomach and uterus, they are arranged in two sets, a superficial beneath the serous coat, a deep in the submucous coat. The lymphatics of the stomach leave that organ along with the blood-vessels; some join -the lymphatics from the spleen, others the lumbar lymphatics, others one of the larger lacteals before it enters the receptaculum chyli. The lymphatics of the uterus receive those from the ovaries and vagina; whilst some accompany the ovarian arteries to join the lumbar lymphatic glands, others pass to the glands and lymph- vessels which accompany the internal iliac artery. The lymphatics of the bladder and vesicul^ seminales also enter the internal iliac glands and lymph-vessels. In the solid viscera the lymphatics are arranged in two sets. ^ The stiperfidal are situated in relation to the tunica propria of the organ; the deep accompany the blood- vessels which pass into its substance.

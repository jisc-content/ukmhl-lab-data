ANATOMY. 862 named chorion, amnion, allantois, and umbUical vesicle, the mode of formation of whicii will now be considered. When the ovum becomes fertilised by the penetration of spermatozoa through the zona pellucida, developmental changes take place in it, which lead to the production not only of the embryo, but of the foetal membranes. The yelk undergoes cleavage, and becomes subdivided into multitudes of minute cells, each consisting of a nucleated clump of protoplasm. These cells form, immediately within the zona pellucida, a cellular membrane, the blas- toderm, which surrounds the undifferentiated central part of the yelk, assumes a vesicular form, and is named the hlastodermic vesicle. At one part of the blastoderm a roundish white spot then appears and forms the area germinativa, or area of formation of the future embryo. Commencing at the area germinativa the blastoderm splits into two layers, an outer, epiderm or epiblast, and an inner, hypoderm or hypoblast. Subsequently a third or intermediate layer is formed, the mesoderm or mesoblast. Whilst these changes are taking place in the cells derived from the differentiation of the yelk, the zona pellucida, which was at first quite smooth, gives rise, at least in the dog and rabbit, to numerous short, simple villi, which form the villi of the primitive chorio?i. Whether or not similar villous outgrowths project from the zona pellucida of the human ovum has not yet been determined. These villi are, like the zona itself, perfectly structureless, and their apparent object is to attach the ovum in the early stage of gestation to the surface of the uterine mucous membrane. In a short time the primitive chorion disappears, and is replaced by the secondary or

176 ANATOMY. it has been supposed that a bone originally developed in car- tilage cannot be homologous with one originally developed in fibrous membrane, and that a fundamental morpho- logical distinction should be drawn between cartilage bones and membrane bones. But when it is considered that, though the place of formation may vary, the method of formation is the same in aU locaUties, it does not appear that so much importance should be attached to the distinc- tion between cartilage and membrane bones as it has some- times received. Moreover, the differences between these two varieties of bones are, during the growth of the bone, still further diminished, for in both cases increase in thick- ness takes place in the same kind of pre-existing tissue, and in the same way, viz., by ossification of the deep periosteal layer of osteo-blasts. In the description of the development of bone in the fcetus and young person, the formation of medullary spaces was referred to. But the production of spaces in bone is by no means Hmited to its early stages of growth. ^ The medullary canal in a long bone can scarcely be said to exist in the bones of an infant's Umbs. The hollowing out of the shaft of a long bone into a large canal, and the enlargement of the spaces of the canceUated tissue, goes on not only up to the period of adult life, but even to ad- vanced years; so that in an old person the relative size of this canal is greater than in the prime of Ufe. The Haver- sian spaces also, as Tomes and De Morgan pointed out, are produced by the absorption of the lamella of the osseous tissue surrounding the Haversian canals, and the production of these spaces is constantly going on during the life of the bone.

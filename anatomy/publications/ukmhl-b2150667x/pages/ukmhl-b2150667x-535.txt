PELVIC VENOUS PLEXUSES. 5J9 common iliac artery; tlie left vein is at first to tlie inner side of its artery, and then ascends behind the right common iliac artery. The Internal Iliac vein is formed in the cavity of the pelvis by the junction of a number of veins which correspond to the branches of the internal iHac artery. It lies in front of the sacro-iliac joint, and opposite the brim of the pelvis joins the external iliac to form the common iliac vein. The iliac veins are without valves. The veins which correspond to the visceral branches of the internal iliac artery form, in relation with their respec- tive viscera, complicated venous plexuses. The prostatic venom plexus surrounds the prostate gland, and receives at its anterior part the dorsal vein of^the penis, which enters the pelvis by piercing the sub-pubic ligament and does not end in the deep pudic vein. The prostatic plexus com- municates behind with the vesical venous plexus, which is arranged on the outer aspect of the muscular coat of the bladder, and is especially well marked at the base of the bladder. The vesical and prostatic plexuses communicate with the h(Bmorr1ioidal venous plexus, which is arranged in and around the wall of the lower end of the rectum and anal onfice. The hsemorrhoidal plexus communicates with the superior hemorrhoidal vein, which forms one of the rootlets of the portal system of veins ; it also gives rise to ' the middle and inferior hsemorrhoidal veins, which join the deep pudic vein of the internal iliac, and is thus brought into connection with the system of the inferior vena cava. In the female a vaginal venous plexus sur- rounds the wall of the vagina, and a uterine venous plexus IS arranged on and in the waU of the uberus, and between

ANATOMY. 738 The hepatic, or hile duct, is the tube that conveys the bile out of the liver. It leaves the transverse fissure as two branches, one from the right, another from the left lobe, which almost immediately unite at an acute angle. As already stated, it closely accompanies within the liver the ramifications of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and its terminal branches pass between the lobules to form the interlobular branches of the duct. If the hepatic duct be injected, not only does the injection fiU the interlobular ducts, but it flows into a set of excessively miimte passages within the lobules themselves. These passages are ar- ranged so as to form a polygonal network, which may appropriately be called the intralobular biliary network. This network has a most intimate relation to the polyhedral hepatic cells, for the passages lie between the flattened sides of adjacent cells, so that each cell is enclosed in a mesh of the network. The German observers, who first directed attention to these passages, named them bile-capillaries, and Macgil- lavry, Frey, and Eberth supposed that they possessed an independent wall, distinct from the hepatic cells between which they are situated. But it is doubtful if such a wall exists, and it seems much more probable that they are merely intercellular passages bounded by the protoplasm of the hepatic cells. The intra-lobular biliary network differs from the intra- lobular blood capillary network, not only in the character of the fluid conveyed, but in other important particulars. The bile passages have a transverse diameter of about J^th that of the blood capillaries: the passages are in relation to the sides of the cells, the bbod capiUaries to

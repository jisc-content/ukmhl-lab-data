But tlie evidence whicli has been advanced in support of this hypothesis is by no means satisfactory or conclusive, whilst the correctness of the theory of the direct descent of protoplasm from pre-existing Living protoplasm is supported by thou- sands of observations made by the most competent in- quirers. In the process of conversion of protoplasm into the several tissues, a diEFerentiation of form and structure (i.e., a morphological or histological differentiation), and of composition (i.e., a chemical differentiation) takes place, the result of which is a physiological differentiation, and the tissues and organs become adapted to the performance of special functions. Hence arise the several forms of tissue which occur in the human body and in the higher animals. Many of the tissues consist exclusively of cells, which present in different parts of the body characteristic modifications in external configuration, ia composition, and in properties, as may be seen in the fatty tissue, pig- mentary tissue, and epithelium. Other tissues, again, consist partly of cells, and partly of an intermediate material which separates the" constituent cells from each other. Here also the cells present various modifications; and the intermediate material, termed the matrix or intercelhdar stibstance, varies in structure, in composi- tion, and in properties in the different textures, as is seen in the connective, cartilaginous, osseous, and muscu- lar tissues. It is not an easy matter to devise a classification of the tissues, based on their structural characters, which shall be in all respects logically perfect; but a ecu-

KIDNEY. 791 coat. The stellate veins give origia to larger veins, whicli pass through the cortex towards the meduUa, along with the interlobular arteries, and receive in their course numerous smaU veins from the cortical capillary plexus. They unite near the bases of the medullary pyramids into larger veins, which form venous arcades (fig. 221). But the renal artery also -gives branches to the medul- lary pyramids of the kidney, and perforating branches, which pierce the fibrous coat, and anastomose in the sur- rounding fat with the extra-peritoneal system of arteries (p. 433). The branches to the pyramids are named arteries rectcB, and in part arise directly from the branches of the renal artery, situated near the sides and bases of the pyra- mids, and in part consist of vasa efferentia, proceeding from those glomeruli in the cortex, which lie close to the medulla. In the pyramids the arterise rectse divide into capillaries, which form a plexus in the stroma and surround the straight and the looped tubes. To some extent, there- fore, but not altogether, the circulation of blood to the medullary pyramids is independent of that in the cortex. Veins called venulce rectos correspond to the arterise rectsB, and run from the apex to the base of a pyramid, where they end in the larger veins of the cortex. These join to form the venous trunks, which accompany the arteries in the columns of Bertin to the hilus, where they unite to form the renal vein, which lies in front of the artery, and opens into the inferior cava. Lymphatic vessels emerge from the hilus of the kidney and from its fibrous coat. The superficial lymphatics arise, according to Ludwig, from lymph-spaces, situated between the convoluted tuba^i of the cortex. The origin

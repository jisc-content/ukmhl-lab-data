709 SMALL INTESTINE. in some parts of the mucosa these corpuscles, with their supporting framework of retiform tissue, are collected into distinct masses or follicles, visible to the naked eye, and known in descriptive anatomy as the solitary and Peyer's glands or follicles. The solitary glands are scattered throughout the whole length of the intestinal mucous membrane. They are about the size of millet seeds, and vary in number and distinctness in different individuals. They are globular or ovoid in form, and occasion a slight elevation of the mucous membrane. One pole of the gland, sometimes named the cupola, lies next the free surface of the mucous membrane, and is in relation to the columnar epithelium covering the mucosa, whilst the opposite pole, or base, rests on the submucous coat. Peyer's glands, or the agminated glands, consist of an aggregation of solitary glands or follicles, which are crowded together, so as to form distinct elongated patches, which may vary in length from one quarter inch to three or four inches. The long axis of each patch corresponds to the long axis of the intestine, and the patches are placed opposite to the mesenteric attachment of the bowel. Villi either may, or may not, be situated on the surface of the patch, in the intervals between the individual follicles, but Lieberkiihnian glands are always found opening on the surface, and frequently forming a ring of orifices around each follicle. Peyer's patches are most abundant in the lower end of the ileum, but diminish in size and numbers in its upper end and in the jejunum, and are absent in the duodenum. These follicles are lymphoid organs, and are composed of

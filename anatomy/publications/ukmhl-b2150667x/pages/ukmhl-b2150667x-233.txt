Along certain lines the cranial dura mater spHts into two layers, to form tubular passages for the transmission of renous blood. These passages are named the venous blood sinuses of the dura mater, and they are lodged in the grooves on the inner surface of the skull referred to in the descrip- tion of the cranial bones.

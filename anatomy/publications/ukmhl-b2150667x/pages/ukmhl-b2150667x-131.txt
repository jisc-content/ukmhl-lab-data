GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 115 and these are called uni- or multi-cellular organisms. CeUa also enter in the most material manner into the constitution of the textures of all the higher forms of plants and animals. Not unfrequently the peripheral part of the protoplasm of the cell diflFerentiates into a distinct investing envelope, technically named a cell tvall or cell mem^brane. In the earlier periods of investigation into the minute structure of cells it was believed that a cell wall was con- stantly present, and that each cell was a minute micro- scopic vesicle or bladder, which in its typical shape was globular or ovoid, but capable of undergoing various modi- fications both in form and chemical composition. The material enclosed by the cell wall was termed the cell con- tents, and either in the midst of these contents or in con- tact with the cell wall was the nucleus, which might or might not contain a nucleolus. Schwann believed that the cell wall was the most active constituent of the cell, i.e., pos- sessed the power not only of producing chemical and physical changes in its own substance and in the cell contents, but of separating materials from the surrounding media,â€”of secreting them, as it were, into the interior of the cell. In this manner he accounted for the formation in some cells of fat, in others of pigment, in others of the characteristic secretion of glands, and so on. It was then maintained by John Goodsir that the nucleus was the part of a cell which in aU probability was concerned in separating and preparing its characteristic cell contents, and in its nutrition. Martin Barry and Goodsir also contended that the reproduction and multi- plication of cells were due to self-division of the nucleus.

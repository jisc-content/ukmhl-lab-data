142 ANATOMY. THIRD GEOUP. Cells imbedded in Solid Tissues. The cells wMch are imbedded in the soUd tissues are either grouped together in considerable masses, or, as not unfrequently happens, are more or less separated by an intermediate matrix, or intercellular substance. The matrix substance varies in its character in dififerent tissues, and sometimes is so abundant as to obscure the cells. The textures which are constructed on this plan are of great importance, and constitute by far the larger propor- tion of the tissues not only of the human body, but of the bodies of animals generally. Sometimes these tissues are elongated into delicate threads or fibres, at other times they are expanded into thin membranes, at others they form solid masses of considerable thickness. Connective Tissue. By the term Connective Tissue is meant a group of tissues which, though the members of the group differ in various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters, yet agree in the property of bind- ing or connecting together other tissues or parts of the body, and in serving as a supporting framework for more delicate tissues. This group of tissues is the most exten- sively diffused of aU the textures, for there is no organ in the body which does not contain one or other of its forms. The following varieties, based on modifications in their appearance and structm-e, may be recognised.

ANATOMY. 832 subjacent tissue abounding in corpuscles, which projects from the interstitial tissue of the Wolffian body, and sub- sequently becomes the vascular stroma of the ovarj^ Both the epithelium and the vascular stroma of the ovary are differentiations of the cells of the mesoblast. The superficial epithelium is named by Waldeyer the germ epithelium, for from its cells the ova are produced. It consists of columnar corpuscles, arranged side by side so as to cover the free surface of the ovary. Each germ epithelium corpuscle consists, as has been pointed out by J. Foulis, of an elongated, columnar-shaped nucleus, invested by so thin and delicate a layer of protoplasm, that the nucleus forms the most noticeable part of the corpuscle The corpuscles are from gwu^*'^ TsVot^ inch in their long, and about -^^i"^ in their short diameter. Waldeyer showed that changes then took place m some of these germ epithelial corpuscles; the nucleus swelled out into a spherical body, the protoplasm around the nucleus increased considerably in quantity, a nucleolus appeared within the nucleus, and the corpuscles assumed a spherical form, and formed'a primordial ovum. At the same time involutions of the columnar germ epithelium into the substance of the ovary are taking place on various parts of its surface, and some of the corpuscles of this involuted epithelium pass through modifications in form and struc- ture similar to those seen in the epithelium on the free surface of the ovary, so that spherical corpuscles, or pri- mordial ova, appear also in it. The sub-epithelial tissue, or ovarian stroma, now contains multitudes of fusiform connective tissue corpuscles, with some capillary blood- vessels. A coincident growth takes place in it, so that

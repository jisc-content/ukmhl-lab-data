MEMBEANES OF BKAIN AND SPINAL COED. 219" is pierced laterally by the roots of the several spinal nerves in their passage outwards to the intervertebral foramina. Both the cranial and the spinal parts of the dura mater consist of a tough, fibrous membrane containing numerous elastic fibres; somewhat flocculent externally, but smooth, ghstening, and free on its inner surface. The inner sur- face has the appearance of a serous membrane, and when examined microscopically is seen to be covered by a layer of squamous endothelial cells, similar to those drawn in fig. 34. Hence the dura mater is sometimes called a fibro- serous membrane. The dura mater is well provided with lymph vessels, which in all probability open by stomata on the free inner surface. Nerves have been traced to the cranial dura mater both from the fifth cranial nerve and the sympathetic. Between the dura mater and the arach- noid membrane is a fine space containing a mimite quan- tity of limpid serum, which moistens the smooth inner surface of the dura and the corresponding smooth outer surface of the arachnoid. It is regarded as equivalent to the cavity of a serous membrane, and is named the arachnoid cavity, or, more appropriately, the suh-dural space. Arachnoid mater.â€”The arachnoid is a membrane of great delicacy and transparency, which envelopes both the brain and spinal cord. It is separated from these organs by the pia mater; but between it and the latter membrane is a distinct space, called sub-arachnoid. The sub-arachnoid space is more distinctly marked beneath the spinal than beneath the cerebral parts of the arachnoid, which membrane forms a looser investment for the cord than for the brain. At the base of the brain, and oppo-

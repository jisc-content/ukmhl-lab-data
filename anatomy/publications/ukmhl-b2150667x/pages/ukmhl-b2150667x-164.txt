148 ANATOMY. tissue, from its elasticity, make up the mass of the liga- mentum nuchse, the ligamenta sub-flava, and the yellow elastic coat of the arteries. They are also found mingled with the white fibres, in the fibrous membranes, the skin, the mucous and serous membranes, the areolar tissue, in ten- dons, and some ligaments. In the liga- menta sub-flava and nuchse the yellow fibres are arranged in bundles, the in- dividual fibres of which are comparatively broad, with a distinct dark outline. They branch, and their branches readily break across, and the broken end then curls upon itself. Their diameter is about th inch. In the coats of the arteries 4 0 0 0 FIG 4' -Fasciculus the elastic fibres form an anastomosing â€¢ ist'tisfue'tm network.

They possess, however, a distinct and definite outline; they branch and occasionally anastomose; and the individual fibres, possess- ing a ring-like, spiral, or twisted course, are wound around the bundles of the white fibres. The white fibres yield gelatine on boiUng, but the elastic fibres do not. The white fibres sweU up and become so transparent under the action of acetic acid as to be no longer recognisable. The yellow fibres, again, are not affected by that reagent. Quekett pointed out that the elastic fibres of the Uga- mentum michse of the giraffe were marked by transverse strise, and M. Watson has seen a similar appearance in the elastic pericardiac Ugament of the elephant. These transverse stride are apparently cracks in the fibre; and, as

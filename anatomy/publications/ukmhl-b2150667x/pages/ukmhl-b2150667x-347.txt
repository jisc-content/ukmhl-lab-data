THE EYEBALL. 331 pointed out, long digitate processes, wliich interlock with those of the adjacent cells. The proper tissue of the cornea is a modified form of connective tissue. When examined fresh it appears as if perfectly homogeneous, but after a time, and more espe- cially if hardened in alcohol, chloride of gold, and other reagents, it is seen to , consist of cells and an ( intercellvdar matrix. Ov Mk The cells consist of two kinds, — those •7T"~'^**^ —•°~«^.-' which belong to the cornea, and those 1 . , , .

The proper cornea cells or cornea corpuscles were first seen by Toynbee, and have been carefully studied by numerous subsequent observers. They are large stellate, flattened cells, and lie with their surfaces parallel to the sur- faces of the cornea; they possess branching thread-like pro- cesses, and the processes of adjacent cells anastomose to form a ceH network (Fig. 98). They consist of nucleated masses of protoplasm, which Kiihne showed to be contractile, and are apparently destitute of a cell waU. In vertical sections through the cornea the corpuscles seem as if shaped like elongated spindles. The migrating cells of the cornea were first seen by von Recklinghausen. They resemble white blood corpuscles, and possess active amoeboid movements, so that they can wander through the corneal tissue. In a healthy cornea they have migrated out of the marginal blood-vessels; but in an inflamed cornea, where their num- ber is greatly increased, they are in pait white corpuscles

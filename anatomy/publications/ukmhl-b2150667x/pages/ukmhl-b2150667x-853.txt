837 FALLOPIAN TUBE, The oviduct possesses foiu coats. The external or se7'ous coat is continuous with the peritoneum forming the broad ligament. The muscular coat consists of an external longitudinal, and an internal circular layer of non-striped fibres, continuous with the muscular wall of the uterus. Beneath the muscular coat is the submucous coat, formed of vascular ^connective tissue. The internal or mucous coat lines the Fallopian tube, and is continuous with the mucous lining of the uterus. It is elevated into longi- tudinal folds, and is covered on its free surface with a ciliated columnar epithelium; glands do not exist in the mucous membrane. At the external orifice the ciliated columnar epithelium is prolonged upon the inne^^surface of the fimbriae, and on these processes it passes into the squamous endothelium of the peritoneum. Though the oviduct is not directly continuous with the substance of the ovary, yet when ova are being shed, through rupture of the wall of the Graafian follicles, the fimbriated end of the Fallopian tube embraces the surface of the ovary, so that the ova can enter its mouth. The ovary therefore differs from glands generally in not having its excretory duct directly continuous with its secreting structure. The ovum is propelled along the duct, partly by the movements of the cilia, and partly doubtless by a peristaltic contraction of the muscular coat.

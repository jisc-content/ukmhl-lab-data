689 STOMACH. spleeQ : the gastro-colic, or great omentum, descends from the greater curvature of the stomach in front of the coils of the small intestine, and then ascends to enclose the transverse colon. Structure of the Stomach. The wall of the stomach consists of four coats, named from without inwards, serous, muscular, sub-mucous^ and mucous coats. The external or serous coat is that part of the peritoneal membrane which encloses the stomach; one layer covering the anterior, the other the posterior surface. It leaves the stomach at the curvatures, where it forms the great and v small omenta, and along these borders the two layers enclose between them the blood-vessels and nerves which supply the organ. The serous coat is loosely united to the subjacent muscular coat by areolar tissue, which is some- times called the subserous coat. The muscular coat consists of non-striped fibres arranged in three layers from without inwards. The outer layer consists of longitudinal fasciculi, which are continuous with the external longitudinal layer of the oesophagus. They form scattered fasciculi extending longitudinally over the surface of the stomach from cardia to pylorus, but along the two curvatures, more especially the lesser, they are collected into stronger bundles, and at the pylorus become continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the duodenum. The middle layer consists of circular fasciculi, which form a ring-like arrangement transversely to the long axis of the stomach. These fasciculi are comparatively thin and scattered at the cardiac end, but as they approach

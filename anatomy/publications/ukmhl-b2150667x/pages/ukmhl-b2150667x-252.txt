236 ANATOMY. to the skin over tlie parotid gland and the adjacent part of the auricle; the transversalis colli, also from the 2d and 3d cervical, to the skin of the front of the side of the neck; the supra-clavicular nerves, from the 3d and 4th cervical, to the skin of the lower part of the side of the neck, and upper part of the chest. The Brachial plexus is formed of the four lower cervical nerves, and of the larger portion of the first thoracic, called also first dorsal nerve (Fig. 76). It is of large size, and is principally for the supply of the upper limb. Its exact mode of arrangement presents many variations, but the following is not unfrequently found:â€”The fifth and sixth nerves join to form a large nerve, which, after a short course, is joined by the seventh; in this manner the uj^jm- cord of the plexus is formed. The eighth cervical and the first dorsal then join, to form the lower cord of the plexus. The cords then pass behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle into the axiUa, where they become modified in arrangement. From each a large branch arises, and these two branches then join to form a third cord. The three cords have special relations to the axillary artery : the one which lies to its outer side is named the outer cord ; that to the inner, the inn&f cord; that behind, the posterior cord. These nerves and the cords formed by them give origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. The Communicating branches join the middle and in- ferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the scaleni, longus colli, rhomboid, and subclavius muscles; also the supra and infra-spinatus muscles, through a branch caUed sup-a- scapular, which arises from the cord formed by the 5th

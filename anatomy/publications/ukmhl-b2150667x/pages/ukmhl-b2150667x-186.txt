170 ANATOMY. duced by secondary changes in a pre-existing material. The mode of production of the osseous tissue in the car- tilaginous and fibrous tissues wiU now be considered, and it should be clearly understood at the outset that, in normal ossification, bone is not formed by a mere calcification of the matrix of the pre-existing tissue, and a direct conver- sion of the cartilage or connective tissue corpuscles into bone corpuscles; but, as the researches of Sharpey, Bruch, H. MiiUer, Lovdn, and Gegenbaur have made known, is due to a development of new corpuscles, which Gegenbaur lias named osteo-blasts, accompanied by an abundant forma- tion of blood-vessels. When the process of ossification in temporary cartilage begins, a change takes place in the arrangement of its cells at the centre, or point, or nucleus of ossification. The cells, instead of preserving their irregularly scattered arrange- ment in the matrix, are now collected into longitudinal parallel rows, not unlike what was described in a previous section, in the deeper cells of encrusting cartilage. In each row the cells lie with their long axes transverse, and apparently multiply by a process of fission. The cells at the end of the rows which lie nearest the centre of ossific change swell out and become more rounded. Calcification of the matrix substance, which separates not only the parallel rows of cells, but also the cells in the same row, from each other, then takes place, which calcification in- cludes also the capsules of the cartilage cells. A general opacity of the cartilage is the resvilt of this calcification, and the further progress of ossification is rendered obscure. It is necessary, therefore, to dissolve out by an acid the calcareous matter, in order to follow the steps of the process.

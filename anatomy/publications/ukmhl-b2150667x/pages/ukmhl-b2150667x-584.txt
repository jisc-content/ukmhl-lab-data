568 ANATOMY. person, a prolongatioa of the gland, named the pyramid, ascends from the upper border of the isthmus, in front of the cricoid and thyrcjid cartilages, as far even as the hyoid bone. A muscle, called levator glandulae thyroideas, is often seen passing from the pyramid, or the adjacent part of the gland, to the hyoid bone. The gland is normally bigger in women than in men. It often undergoes a pathological enlargement, named bronchocele or goitre. In many mammals, as the camel, alpaca, nylghau, harte- beest, dog, warthog, porcupine, and kangaroo, the isthmus is wanting, and the two lateral lobes are quite discon- nected ; whilst in the feline carnivora the isthmus is very small in relation to the size of the lateral lobes. Structure.—The thyroid gland is closely invested by a thin capsule of connective tissue, and is not divided into definite lobules, capable of separation from each other. When sections are made into its substance it is seen to be made up of numbers of closed vesicles, separated from each other by intermediate connective tissue, which is continuous with the investing capsule. These vesicles are just visible to the naked eye, and are spherical or ovoid in form (fig. 158). Each vesicle is said to be bounded by a delicate hyaloid membrane, lined on its inner surface by a single layer of somewhat cubical epithelial cells ; but Pere- meschko thinks that no hyaloid membrane is present, and that the cells rest directly on the surrounding connective tissue. The vesicles contain a translucent, viscous fluid, which coagulates by the action of heat, alcohol, or nitric acid. The enlargement of the gland in goitre is due to a distension of the vesicles, and an accumulation of the glairy colloid fluid in their interior. ■

394 ANATOMY. Blood-Vasculae System. The blood flows througli the blood-vascular system in a given direction, and its movement is called the circulation of the blood. In man and the higher vertebrates the heart is a double organ, i.e., it consists of a right and a left portion, intimately united to, but not directly communicat- ing with, each other. The blood which flows from its right side passes through vessels which traverse the lungs, and is conveyed to the left side of the heart: this is called the pulmonary circulation. The blood which flows from the left side passes through vessels which traverse the body generally, and is conveyed to the right side of the heart: this is called the systemic circulation. The complete circu- lation, i.e., the passage of a drop of blood, from one side of the heart, back again to the same side, can only be effected by passing through both the pulmonic and systemic circu- lations. Hence the complete circulation is sometimes called a double circulation. The vessels which carry the blood away from the heart are called arteries. The arteries branch and terminate in a network of vessels of microscopic size called capillaries. The vessels which convey the blood back to the heart are veins, and the veins arise from the capillaries. The arteries and veins do not communicate directly with each other, but centrally through the intermediation of the heart, and peripheraUy through the intermediation^of the capH- laries. Hence, both in the pulmonary and systemic circu- lations, the blood in its passage from the arteries into the veins must go through capillaries. The blood which flows from the left side of the heart into the systemic arteries is

It is smaller than an almond, is sub- divided into lob- ules, and belongs to the group of compound race- mose glands. It consists of the ramifications of short ducts, which terminate in clus- l^S- —Lacluymal canals and duct. 1, orbicular muscle; 2 and 3, lachrymal canals; 4. carincula; 5, ters of small sac- l^<='"'y™al sac 5 6, lachrymal duct; 7, angular artery. cuK. The waU of each sacculus consists of a delicate membrana propria, and the cavity contains the polyhedral secreting cells. Outside the membrana propria is a capillary network derived from the lachrymal artery, but Giannuzzi and Boll have recently described a space between this network and the membrana propria which theybeHeve to be continuous with the lymphatic system. Piiiiger haa dascribed nerves as terminating in connection with the secreting ceUs. The excretory ducts of the gland are from SIX to eight in number, and open on the back of the upper eye-Ud,and the tears are washed over the surface of the globe by the involuntary winking of this lid. When the secre- tion 18 increased in quantity, in the act of crying, the tears flow over the cheek, but in ordinary circumstances they are

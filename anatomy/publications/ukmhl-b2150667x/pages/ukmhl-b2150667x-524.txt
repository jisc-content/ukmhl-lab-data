ANATOMY. 508 The Subclavian vein is the direct continuation of the axillary; it courses upwards and inwards across the root of the neck, and joins the internal jugular, to form the brachio-cephalic vein. It lies anterior and inferior to the subclavian artery, and rests in a groove on the upper sur- face of the first rib, in front of the scalenus anticus muscle, which separates it at that spot from the artery. It receives the vertebral vein, which descends at the side of the verte- bral artery, in the^vertebrarterial foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, as far as the sixth vertebra, and then enters the subclavian vein : it receives various spinal veins and the deeio cervical vein. The subclavian vein also receives two of the superficial veins of the neck, the anterior and external jugiilar veins. The Anterior Jugular vein commences by the junc- tion of small rootlets in the superficial fascia of the sub- maxillary region : it descends close to the anterior middle line of the neck, and joins either the subclavian vein directly, or the external jugular vein. The opposite anterior jugulars are frequently connected together by a transverse branch which passes across the middle line, above the sternum, and superficial to the trachea. The External Jugular vein commences in the sub- stance of the parotid gland, by the junction of the temporal, internal maxillary, transverse facial, posterior auricular, and sometimes the occipital veins, all of which correspond to branches of the external carotid artery. It passes obliquely downwards and backwards under the platysma ; but super- ficial to the cervical fascia and sterno-mastoid muscle, and a little above the clavicle, pierces the fascia and enters the sub-

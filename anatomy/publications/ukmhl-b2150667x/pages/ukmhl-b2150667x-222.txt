ANATOMY, 206 been seen by Elin to end in the epitheKal investment of tbe mucous membrane of the mouth. Connected with the sensory nerves in some localities are the remarkable bodies named the Corpuscles of Pacini, which were the first terminal organs discovered in connec- tion with the peripheral distribution of the nerves. These corpuscles have been found attached to the nerves which pass to the skin of the fingers and toes, to the nerves which supply the skin of the neck and arm, to the inter- costal nerves, to the nerves of the joints, to the nerves of the periosteum, to the nerves of the genital organs, and to the mesenteric nerves. In cats they are often extremely abundant both in the mesentery and omenta. A Pacinian corpuscle can be seen by the naked eye, and looks like a minute grain from -^th. to -^gth inch long. It is elliptical in form, and may either be sessile or attached to the nerve stem by a slender stalk. Examined microscopically, it is seen to consist of numerous layers of connective tissue concentrically arranged, which form its capsule, and surround a central core of transparent homogeneous proto- plasm. Numerous connective tissue corpuscles may be seen in the concentric layers, and Hoyer has recently shown that an appearance of flat endothelial-Like cells exists on the inner surface of the layers of the capsule. Entering one pole of the corpuscle is a nerve fibre which extends along the axial core for a considerable distance, and usually termi- nates in a slight bulbous enlargement. . The nerve fibre parts with its perineurial sheath after it enters the Pacinian corpuscle; and as it Lies in the core it loses its meduUary sub- stance, so that its terminal part consists only of the axial cyUnder. Sometimes the nerve fibre divides into two branches

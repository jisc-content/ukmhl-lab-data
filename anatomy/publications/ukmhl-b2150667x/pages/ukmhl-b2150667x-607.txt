591 CARTILAGES OF LAEYNX. the thyroid and the side of the cricoid cartilage, between which is a diarthodial joint, enclosed by a capsular liga- ment, and lined by a synovial membrane. The Epiglottis is a leaf-like plate of yellow fibro- cartilage situated in front of the upper opening of the larynx. Its elongated stalk passes vertically downwards behind the body of the hyoid, and the projecting angle of the thyroid cartilage to be attached to the inner surface of this angle by the thyro-epiglottic ligament (fig. 161). The blade of the leaf is ovoid in form, and projects upwards behind the tongue. Its surfaces are directed forwards and backwards, and are covered by mucous membrane, which is prolonged from the anterior surface to the back of the tongue as the glosso-epiglottidean folds ; beneath tbese folds is an elastic membranous band, the glosso- epiglottidean ligament, whicb stretches from the root of the tongue to the anterior surface of tbe epiglottis ; and on a stiU deeper plane is the hyo-epiglottidean ligament, an elastic membrane, which attaches th.e front of the epi- glottis to the body, and great cornua of the hyoid. The posterior siirface, concave from side to side, is free, and possesses a prominence called the cushion (figs. 163, 164). The upper border is free and rounded; but from the lateral borders the mucous membrane is prolonged down- wards and backwards, as fiav as the cornicula laryngis and arytenoid cartilages, to form a pair of folds, the aryteno-ejyiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, which form the lateral boundaries of the superior opening of the larynx. The cartilage of the epiglottis is pitted by numerous depressions, in which mucous glands are lodged.

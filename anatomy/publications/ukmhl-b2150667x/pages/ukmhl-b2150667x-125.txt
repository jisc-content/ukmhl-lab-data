JOINTS AND MUSCLES. 109 The muscles attached to the appendicular skeleton are either limited to the limbs (purely appendicular, therefore), or pass from the axial part of the body to the limb (axi-appendicular). The axi-appen- dicular group are undoubtedly prolongations of the axial system of muscles. They are in the upper limb derived from the epi-skeletal subdivision, and form the trapezius, rhomboid, levator anguli scapulae, latissimus dorsi, subclavius, serratus magnus, and greater and smaller pectoral muscles. In the lower limb they are in part derived from the hypo-skeletal subdivision, and form the psoas and pyriformis; and in part, as the glutaeus maximus, from the epi- skeletal subdivision. It is not improbable that the purely appen- dicular muscles are also prolongations of the axial system, and that as the limbs, in their* development from their fundamental bud- like lappets, rmdergo both a transverse and a longitudinal seg- mentation, so the muscular mass, prolonged into them, differen- tiates both transversely and longitudinally into a motor apparatus, fitted for the performance of the special functions of each exti-emity.

The capillaries radi- ate like minute stars from the terminal twigs of the choroidal arteries and veins. The choroidal arteries and veins form a layer external to the capillaries, i.e., next the lamina fusca. The arteries are the short posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic artery, which pierce the sclerotic close to the entrance of the optic nerve, and, running forwards in a tor- tuous manner, divide dichotomously before ending in the capillaries. The veins of the choroid are arranged in a series of remarkable whorls, named the ven<je vorticosce, which receive the blood not only from the capillaries of the choroid proper, but from those of the iris and ciliary body ^ they discharge their blood by means of from 4 to 6 veins into the ophthalmic vein. The ciliari/ miiscle is the greyish white structure which forms the outer part of the ciliary body. It was at one time called the ciliary ligament, but Its muscular nature was discovered almost simultaneously by Bowman and Briicke. It consists of smooth involuntary muscle, the fibres of which are arranged in two layers. The outer and thicker part of the muscle consists of fasci^ culi, which arise close to the canal of Schlemm, i.e., opposite the junction of the sclerotic and cornea, and radiate from before backwards in the meridian of the eyeball, between the ciliaiy processes and the sclerotic. The inner part of the muscle forms a ring-like arrangement of fasciculi close to the circumference of the iris, and is often called the annular muscle of MiUler. Iwanoff has shown that in long-sighted persons (hypermetropic) the annular muscle IS strongly developed; whilst in short-sighted (myopic) eyes its fasciculi are very feeble. The Ciliary Processes

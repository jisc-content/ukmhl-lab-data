SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 315 prolongation a communicating and a distributoiy series of branches are derived. By the Communicating branches this portion of the sympathetic is connected with most of the cranial and with the anterior divisions of all the spinal nerves, so as to bring the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems into close anatomical and physiological relation with each other. It is important also to observe that each communicating branch contains not only non-medullated nerve fibres from the sympathetic system to the cerebro-spinal nerves, but medullated fibres from the cerebro-spinal to the sympa- thetic, so that a double interchange takes place between the two systems. The superior cervical ganglion and its cranial prolongation communicate with the 3d and 4th nerves, with the Gasserian ganglion of the 6th, the 6th, the portio dura of the 7th, the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumo- gastric of the 8th, with the 9th cranial nerve, and with the anterior divisions of the four upper cervical spinal nerves. The middle cervical ganglion communicates with the 5th and 6th cervical nerves : the inferior cervical gan- glion with the 7th and 8th cervical nerves : the twelve thoracic ganglia with the series of intercostal nerves : the five lumbar ganglia with the series of lumbar spinal nerves : the sacral and coccygeal ganglia with the sacral nerves and the coccygeal nerve. The Listributory branches of the gangliated cord are as follows:â€”a, Pharyngeal branches from the superior cervical ganglion, which join the pharyngeal branches of the glosso- pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves, to form the pharyn- geal plexus, which si^plies the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx. 6, Articular branches from the

224 ANATOMY, missures the two halves of the cord are united together. The fibres of the posterior commissure surround a canal, called the central canal, which extends along the whole length of the cord, and even passes into the upper end of the filum terminale. This canal is lined by a cUiated columnar epithelium, and expands superiorly into the cavity of the fourth ventricle. The attached ends of these columnar cells are elongated, and project into the neuroglia of the posterior commissure which surrounds the canal. Each lateral haK of the cord is subdivided into three columns by two depressions, which mark the points of emergence of the roots of the spinal nerves. The an- terior nerve roots pass through the antero-lateral de- pression or fissure, and between it and the antero-median fissure is the an- , terior column of Fig 73.—Transverse section through the spmal cord.

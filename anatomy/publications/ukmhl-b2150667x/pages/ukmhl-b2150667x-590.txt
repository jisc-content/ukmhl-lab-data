ANATOMY. 574 PINEAL GLAND. The Pineal Gland, Couarium, or Epiphysis cerebri, is a reddish body, shaped somewhat like a minute fir cone, which is enclosed within tlie velum interpositum of the pia mater. It lies on the anterior pair of the corpora quadri- gemina of the cerebrum, under cover of the posterior end of the corpus callosum. Attached to its anterior surface are two white bands of nerve fibres, which pass forwards on the inner sides of the optic thalami, and are named the peduncles of the pineal gland. It is invested by a cap- sule and is divided by an internal framework of connective tissue into small alveoli, which contain roundish lymphoid cells, spindle-shaped cells, and multipolar cells. The stroma contains a network of capillary blood-vessels and meduUated nerve fibres. The multipolar cells are larger than the lymphoid and spindle-like cells, and are believed by some observers to be nervous. It is often hollowed out into one or two cavities, which contain not only an inspissated fluid, but amylaceous and gritty calcareous particles, termed brain sand. It is developed in relation to the upper part of the third ventricle, and is present throughout the vertebrata. Its function is unknown.

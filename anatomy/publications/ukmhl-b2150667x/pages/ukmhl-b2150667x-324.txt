ANATOMY. 308 fibres of tlie pons ; c, by ascending fibres wHch apparently arise from the grey tnbercle of E^)lando; d, probably by fibres which traverse and embrace the superior peduncle of the cerebellum. As the large sensory root of the fifth lies on the petrous bone it expands into the Gasserian ganglion, which resembles in structure the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. From this ganglion three large branches arise, named respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d divisions of the ganglion (Fig. 95). The \st or Ophtlmlmic division is the upper sensory nerve of the face, it lies in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and divides into three branches, which pass out of the cra- nial cavity through the sphenoidal fissure, a, Its lachryrml branch supplies the lachrymal gland, and the outer part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, h, lis frontal branch divides into the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital; the supra-trochlear supplies the inner part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyeUd and eyebrow; the supra- orbital supplies the skin of the forehead and scalp as far back as the vertex, c, Its oculo-nasal branch gives long dliary nerves to the eyebaU, a nasal nerve to the mucous mem- brane of the nose, and to the skin of the side of the nose, and an infra-trochlear nerve to the conjunctiva and inte- gument of the eyelids. From the oculo-nasal nerve arises the long or sensory root of the small ciliary ganglion, which Ues in the cavity of the orbit, and which receives also a motor root from the third nerve, and a root from the sympathetic. This gangHon gives origin to the sJm-t ciliary nerves for the eyeball. The 2d or Superior Maxillary division is the sensorj- nerve for the middle part of the face. It leaves the skull

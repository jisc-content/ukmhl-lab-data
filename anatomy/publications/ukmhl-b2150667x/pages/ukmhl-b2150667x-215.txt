NERVOUS TISSUE. 199 recognised without difficulty in the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves of fishes, and it is probable that similar cells exist in the corresponding centres in other vertebrates. These cells usually possess a globular body, though sometimes it may be elongated; and from opposite points of the surface of the body a strong process is given off, which is du-ectly continued into a nerve fibre. The axial cylinder of the fibre is con- tinuous with the cell substance, and Schultze has shown that both exhibit a delicate fibriUated structure. The medul- T!i„„i., riG. 65. — Bipolar lary sheath and the primitive membrane SeJ^e ° fito'^^'cr- are also usuaUy continued from the fibre ^iT^pinll'^anS over the nerve cell Hence these bipolar ^ cells seem to be, as Schultze expressed it, nucleated enlargements of the axial cylinder. A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve cell, carefully studied and described by Lionel Beale, is found in the sympathetic ganglia of the frog. The cells are pear-shaped, and from the narrow end of the pear two nerve fibres arise, one of which, called the straight fibre, forms, as it were, the stalk of the pear; whilst the other, or spiral fibre, winds spirally round the straight fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction. Both fibres are nucleated, and at their origin consist, apparently, of axial cylinder substance only; but in their course they may acquire both a meduUary sheath and a primitive membrane. The straight fibre passes into the interior of the cell substance, and Arnold and Courvoisier

ANATOMY, 20 mentary, have neither neck nor tubercle, and are pointed anteriorly. The ribs are by no means uniform in length : they increase from the first to the seventh or eighth, and then diminish to the twelfth; the first and twelfth are therefore the shortest ribs. The first and second costal cartilages are almost horizontal, but the others are directed upwards and inwards. In its general form the chest may be likened to a trun- cated cone. It is rounded at the sides and flattened in front and behind, so that a man can lie either on his back or his belly. Its truncated apex slopes downwards and forwards, is small in size, and allows of the passage of the windpipe, gullet, large veins, and nerves into the chest, and of several large arteries out of the chest into the neck. The base or lower boundaiy of the cavity is much larger than the apex, slopes downwards and backwards, and is occupied by the diaphragm, a muscle which separates the chest from the cavity of the abdomen. The transverse diameter is greater than the antero-posterior, and the antero- posterior is greater laterally, where the lungs are lodged, than in the mesial plane, which is occupied by the heart. HEAD. The Head foi-ms the summit of the axial part of the body. It consists of two portionsâ€”the Cranium and the Face. The Skull, or skeleton of the head, is composed of 22 bones, 8 of which form the skeleton of the cranium, 14 that of the face. Except the lower jaw, which is move- able, the bones are all finnly united by immovable joints.

826 ANATOMY. The Ovakies. The Ovaries are two flattened oval bodies, in whicli the ova or eggs are found. They are situated in the pelvis, in connection with the posterior surface of the broad liga- ments of the uterus (fig. 231). From their relation to that organ they necessarily change their position along with it, so that, when it enlarges during pregnancy, they rise with it into the abdomen proper. Each ovary is about 1^ inch long, f inch wide, and ^ inch in thickness. It is attached to the broad ligament by its anterior border, which is sometimes called the hilus, for it transmits the vessels and nerves into and out of the organ. Its inner end is at- tenuated and attached to the upper lateral angle of the uterus, by the ligament of the ovary, into which the non- striped muscular fibres of the wall of the uterus are pro- longed. Its outer end, posterior border, and its two surfaces are free ; but to its outer end one of the fimbria? of the Fallopian tube is often attached. Structure of the Ovary. The surface of the ovary is partly smooth and partly marked with small cicatrices, which indicate the spots where^ the surface has given way to allow of the escape of the ova. The ovary is a solid gland, and consists of a surface epi- thelium, of a vascular stroma, of Graafian follicles, and of ova. The surface, epithelium forms a layer continuous with the endothelial cells covering the broad ligament of th6

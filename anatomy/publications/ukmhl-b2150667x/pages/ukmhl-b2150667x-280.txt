264 ANATOMY. volution, and passing forwards to the anterior end of the cerebrum, are three convolutions, arranged in parallel tiers from above downwards, and named su2yerior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions, which are also prolonged on to the orbital face of the frontal lobe, which rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The Parietal Lobe is also complex; its most anterior convolution, named ascending 'parietal, ascends parallel to and immediately behind the fissure of Kolando. Springing from the upper end of the back of this convolution is the postero-parietal convolution, which, forming the boundary of the longitudinal fissure, extends as far back as the parieto-occipital fissure; springing from the lower end of the back of this convo- lution is the swpra-marginal convolution, which forms the upper boundary of the hinder part of the Sylvian fissure; as this gyrus occupies the hollow in the parietal bone, which corresponds to the parietal eminence, it may appro- priately be named the convohition of the parietal eminence.

387 THE SKIN. formed of the cutis, whichi also overlaps the side and root of the nail; thus the nail iits into a groove formed of the cutis something after the manner in which a watch-glass fits into its rim. A nail is merely a special modifica- tion of the cuticle, the cells of the superficial stratum of which eCre more horny, harder, and more firmly adherent to each other than is the case in the cuticle proper. Deeper than the horny stratum is the rete Malpighii of the nail, the cells of which are soft, as in the cuticle itself. The cutis forming the bed of the nail is studded with papillje, which are arranged in almost parallel rows, and are highly vascular. Nails grow both in length and thickness : the increase in thickness is due to the formation of nerve cells on the bed of the nail; the increase in length takes place through the formation of nail cells at its root, and as the nail is thus slowly pushed forward it requires to be cut at intervals. At the root, sides, and below the free border of the naU the cuticle is continuous with the substance of the naU itself. Hair,â€”Projecting from the surface of the skin are multi- tudes of elongated cylindrical horny structures, the hairs. In the skin of the scalp, the armpits, and the pubis, they are long and numerous; but in the eye-brows, eye-lashes, vibrissse of the nostrils, and surface of the body generally, they are short. They are stronger and thicker in the skin of man than of woman, more especially on the cheeks, lips, and chin. Hairs do not grow from the skin of the palms and soles, the back of the ungual phalanges, and the surface of the upper eye-lids. Each hair is partially im- bedded in a depression of the skin, caUed a Mir follicle. The deeper end of the follicle is somewhat dilated, and has in it a

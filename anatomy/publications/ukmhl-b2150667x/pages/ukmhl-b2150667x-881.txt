In the splanchno-pleure forming the wall of the umbUical vesicle, and in the corresponding wall of the alimentary tube, blood-vessels, are developed. As that pole of the umbQical vesicle, which lies opposite the omphalo-mesenteric duct reaches, and is, and at an early period of its development, in contact with a, limited area of the sub-zonal membrane, the- blood-vessels in the wall of the vesicle may be, and in, some mammals are, conveyed by it up to the sub-zonal membrane. In some mammals, as in the Pig, Mare, Cetacea, and Kuminantia, the umbilical vesicle disappears as develop- ment advances, so that no trace of it can be seen in the membranes of an advanced embryo. In others, as the Human subject^, it persists, according to Schultze, even up to .the end of intra-uterine life, as a minute vesicle at the placental end of the umbilical, cord. In the Carnivora and Pinnipedia again it forms a well-defined sac, in rela- tion to the abdominal aspect of the foetus, situated between the allantois and amnion, and prolonged laterally into two horns. In the Bitch I have seen its vessels per- sistent, and forming a well-defined plpxus in its wall, though they did not reach the chorion. In the Eabbit, and probably also in other Rodentia, the umbilical vesicle reaches the chorion, and forms a large sac in contact with a considerable portion of that membrane, to which it conveys blood-vessels: but the discoid placenta of the rabbit apparently derives its foetal vessels only from tbat part of the chorion which receives its vascular supply from the allantois. An important change also takes place at the pelvic end

515' SPINAL VEINS. arches and spines. The veins of the bodies of the vertehrcB lie in canals in the spongy substance of the vertebral bodies, and leave the bone through foramina on its surface, of which the one that opens on the posterior surface of the body is the best marked. The veins within the spinal canal lie in the fatty tissue which separates the dura mater from the bony walls of the canal, and are arranged iii an anterior and a posterior longitudinal group; anterior longitudinal spinal veins lie behind the bodies of the vertebrae in the whole length of the spinal canal; the posterior longitiidinal spinal veins form a plexus in the whole length of the canal immediately in front of the neural arches. The Veins of the Spinal Cord ramify in the pia mater investing the cord, in which they form plexuses. The spinal veins freely anastomose with each other. The veins of the cord communicate with the veins within the canal through small veins, which run with the nerve roots to the foramina in the dura mater, through which the roots proceed; whilst at the upper end of the canal they join the vertebral and the inferior cerebellar veins, and perhaps the petrosal sinuses. The veins of the vertebral bodies communicate with the anterior longitudinal veins. The anterior longitudinal communicate with the posterior longitudinal veins, with which they form a venous plexus ; this plexus is united^to the dorsal spinal veins by veins, which pierce the ligamenta subflava, and pass between the vertebral laminae; it freely communicates also with the lumbar veins, the intercostal veins, and the vertebral veins, by veins which pass outwards through the intervertebral foramina.

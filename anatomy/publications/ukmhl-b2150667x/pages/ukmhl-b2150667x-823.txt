They are lodged in the intervals between the septa testis, and Fig. 226.â€”Transverse section tlirongh the Testicle and Epididymis of an infant.

Each lobe is composed of from two to four or six highly convoluted tubules; and as there are from 250 to 400 lobes in the testis, the num- ber of seminal tubules ranges probably from about 800 to 1000. The convoluted tubules in a lobe are connected together by delicate areolar tissue and capillary blood-

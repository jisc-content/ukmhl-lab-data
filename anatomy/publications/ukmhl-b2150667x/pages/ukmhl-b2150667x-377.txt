361 THE EAR. behind and below the promontory is a round opening closed in by a membrane, the fenestra rotunda, which corresponds with the tympanic passage in the cochlea. The floor of the tympanum is a narrow chink between the inner and outer walls; and the roof is formed by the anterior surface of the petrous-temporal bone. At its anterior wall the tympanum opens into the Eustachian tube, a canal which communicates with the nasal compartment of the pharynx immediately behind the inferior turbinal. The wall of the tympanic end of this tube is formed of bone, that of the pharyngeal end of a curved plate of hyaline cartilage, which is connected to the bone by fibro-cartilage; its pharyngeal orifice is dilated into a trumpet-shaped mouth ; through this tube the ciliated mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx is prolonged into the tympanum. The cartilaginous wall of the tube does not completely surround it, but is completed by a fibrous membrane, and a layer of voluntary muscle, named by Riidinger the dila- tator tub*. Above the tympanic orifice of the Eustachian tube is a fine canal, through which the tensor tympani muscle enters the tympanum. At its posterior waU the tympanum communicates with the au:-sinuses in the mastoid temporal; here also is found a small hollow eminence, pyramid, through a hole at the apex of which the ten- don of the stapedius muscle passes j and a foramen which transmits the chorda tympani nerve. The tympanic cavity contains three small bones, named malleus, incus, and stapes, arranged so as to form an irregular chain, stretching across the cavity from the outer to the inner wall. . The Malleus or hammer is the most external bone. In

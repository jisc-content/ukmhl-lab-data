812 ANATOMY. the pelvis. It thea reaches tlie side of tiie bladder, along which it descends to reach the base of the bladder; in its course it crosses the obliterated hypogastric artery, and goes between the ureter and the bladder. At the base of the bladder it inclines to the inner side of the vesicula seminalis, and, near the base of the prostate gland, it joins the duct of the vesicula to form the common ejaculatory duct. The vas is sacculated and tortuous at the base of the bladder, but in the greater part of its extent it is a cylindrical tube, with dense, firm walls, so that it feels like a piece of whip-cord. It possesses an external coat of connective tissue; within which is a thick coat partly formed of fibro-elastic tissue and partly of non-striped muscle, arranged both longitudinally and circularly. It is lined by a mucous membrane, which is covered by columnar epithelium. The fibro-muscular coat of the sacculated part of the vas is much thinner, and branched tubular glands open on the mucous surface. Owing to the thickness of its wall in the greater part of its extent, the vas deferens possesses a comparatively small lumen. The Vesicula Seminales are two sacculated reservoirs for the semen, situated between the base of the bladder and the rectum. Each vesicula is about 2 inches in length, and consists of a convoluted tube, about 6 inches long, which forms at one end a cul-de-sac, but at the opposite end becomes attenuated into a slender duct, which joins the vas deferens, to form the common ejacu- latory duct. When the convoluted tube of the vesicula is unravelled, it is seen to possess several short diverticula opening into it. The structure of the waU of the vesicula

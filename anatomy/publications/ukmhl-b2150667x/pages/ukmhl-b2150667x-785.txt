The cavity becomes completely closed by the growth of the surrounding connective tissue, and the embryo permanent tooth becomes sacculated. The process of calcification then goes on, in both the^ enamel organ and dental papilla, in a manner similar to that already described, in the temporary teeth. The permanent teeth then.become lodged in sockets in the jaw distinct from, those of the temporary teeth. The sac of each permanent tooth remains connected with the fibrous tissue of the gum^by a slender fibrous band, or gubernacuhm; which passes through a hole in the jaw immediately behind the corresponding milk tooth. • Before the successional permanent tooth erupts, not only should the temporary tooth be &hed, but the bony partition be- tween their res^pective sockets must be absorbed. The superadded permanent teeth, or permanent molars, three in number on each side^. lie behind the successional Fig. 21G.—a, tho lower jaw of a child Ijctween four and five years old. 5, the last, milk molar, with the sacccssional bicuspid tooth in the cavity of reserve imme- diately below it; 6 and 7, the first and second pemianent molars in their sacs; b, the cavity in connection with which the wisdom tooth is formed.

390 ANATOMY. the vitreous layer of the outer wall of the hair follicle. Capillary blood-vessels are distributed on the outer wall of the saccuU. The sacculi are almost entirely filled with polygonal cells containing drops of fat, which cells are continuous with the epithelial lining of the gland duct and the ceUs of the outer root-sheath. These glands secrete a fatty material, which lubricates the surface of the hair. Sometimes a small parasite, called Acarus follieulorum, is found in a sebaceous gland. Some years ago Kolliker described one or two bundles of smooth muscular fibres extending from the wall of the hair follicle to the deep surface of the cutis; these muscles, named arrectores pili, by their contraction erect the hairs, that is, cause them to become more prominent, and produce the condition of skin, called cutis anserina or goose skin, well known to occur when cold is applied to the surface of the body. Hairs are developed about the 4th month of embryo life, within depressions in the cutis, which form the future hair follicles, fiUed with ceUs similar to, and continuous with the epiblast ceUs of the rete Malpighii. A papiUa forms at the bottom of this depression, around which the ceUs become arranged in a bulbous expansion. The cells, in line with the bulb, elongate and harden, and group themselves so as to form the shaft of the young hair, which at this stage is completely buried within the foUicle. A rapid production of new cells takes place at the bulb, the hair consequently increases in length, and is pushed outwards through the superficial horny stratum of the cuticle, wHch had closed in the mouth of the depression or foUicle in which the hair is produced. At the same time, the more external ceUs

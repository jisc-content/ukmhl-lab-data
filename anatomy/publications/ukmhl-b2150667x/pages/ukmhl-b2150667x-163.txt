147 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. tlielial-like cells are obviously a special diflferentiation of the formative cells of the connective tissue at the surface of the bundles. The wide diffusion of the connective tissue throughout the body, and the great importance of its cellular elements, have been esj)ecially dwelt on by Virchow as sources of origin of the new cell forms which arise in various patho- logical processes. The intercellular substance or matrix consists of fibres, which are not uniform in shape, and are divided into the two groups of white and yeUow fibres. The white fibres of connective tissue constitute the most common form, and make up the great, bulk of most ligaments, tendons, and fibrous membranes. They consist of excessively delicate fUaments, varying from a^^o^th to yo-^ootli inch in thickness, which are united together in bundles or fasciculi of variable size. The bundles, as well as the filaments of which they are composed, have a wavy course, and the filaments in each bundle lie almost parallel to each other. The bundles also in some cases are parallel, though in others +1,™ J. • 1 -»T 1 , Fig. 41.—Fasciculi tney cross at various angles.

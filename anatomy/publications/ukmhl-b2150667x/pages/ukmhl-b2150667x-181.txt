165 OSSEOUS TISSUE. f orating 4bres of Sharpey may be drawn out of the holes or sockets in which they are lodged. When thin sections through a macerated and dried bone are examined under the higher powers of the microscope, the lamellated matrix is seen to exhibit a very jjeculiar appearance, which is characteristic of the osseous tissue. Between the surfaces of adjacent lamellae irregularly elongated spaces, caUed lacunce, are to be seen in con- siderable numbers; these lacunte, like the lamellas be- tween which they are situated, have a concentric arrange- ment around the Haversian canals. The lacunae, the lamellfe, and the Haver- sian canal which they surround, are sometimes named a Haversian sys- tem. From the ends and sides of any one of these lacuna very minute ^ ^ Fio. 52.—Transverae section through the com- branching canals, termed p**^' ''^^"'^ °^ °f ^ bone.

The lacunte average in length TSo-ffth inch, and their transverse diameter is about j^\-oth inch ; the canaliculi vary from xs^^th to ^-^oTrtli inch in diameter. When examined in a dried bone by transmitted light, the lacunce look Hke solid, black bodies, and the canaliculi seem to be processes branching off from ' them, hence they were erroneously called by the earlier

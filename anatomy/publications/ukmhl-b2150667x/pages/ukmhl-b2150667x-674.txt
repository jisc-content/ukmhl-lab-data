658 ANATOMY. Giauuzzi has described lymphatics, in the interlobular con- nective tissue, and around the arteries and veins of the glands. The submaxillary and sublingual glands receive their nervous supply from the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, and from the third division of the fifth cranial and sympathetic through the submaxillary ganglion. The parotid gland is supplied by the small superficial petrosal branch of the facial and by the sympathetic. The nerves pass into the interlobular connective tissue, branch in their course, and sometimes are connected to minute ganglia. Pfliiger states that meduUated fibres can be traced up to the gland vesicles, where they perforate the membrana propria, and then lose the medullary sheath, whilst the axial cylinder is prolonged into the protoplasm of the secreting cells. Other meduUated fibres, he says, pierce the walls, of the gland ducts, and after losing their medullary sheath, the axial cylinders branch, and become continuous with the columnar epithelial lining of the duct. He has also described multipolar cells, which he believes to be nervous, directly continuous by their processes with the secreting cells. Pfliiger's observations, however, on the direct continuity of the nerve fibres and cells with the secreting cells of the salivary glands have not been generally accepted. .

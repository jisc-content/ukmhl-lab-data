183 IIUSCULAE TISSUE. If in the same fibre the processes of transverse and longitudinal splitting were to go on simultaneously, then the fibre would be resolved into an immense multitude of rectangular particlesâ€”the sarcous elements of Bow- man. If these particles be regarded as the ultimate sub- divisions of the fibre, then the discs may be conceived to be bmlt up of a number of these particles, possessing similar optical properties, arranged side by side, so as to occupy the entire diameter of the fibre in any transverse plane: whilst the fibrUlas are built up of the particles arranged end to end, so as to correspond to the entire bngth of the fibre; but in this longitudinal arrangement, particles with different optical properties, the one singly lefracting, the other doubly refracting, alternate with each other with the utmost regularity. .Thin describes the ibrillse as collected into parallel bundles, which are separated from adjacent bundles by spaces lined by flat <ells. These spaces he believes to be continuous through ioles in the sarcolemma, which admit the nerves, with ymph spaces outside the sarcolemma, which lie between it and the perimysium. Another view of the structure of muscular fibre, based on observations on the fibres of the water-beetle, has just been advanced by E. A. Schafer. He describes the dark, or, as seen in a living fibre, the "dim discs," as traversed by multitudes of excessively fine, dark, rod-shaped particles parallel in their direction to the fibre itself, which extend into the contiguous bright discs, near the middle of which each muscle rod ends in a knob-like extremity, and the series of knobs form a Hue of minute dark dots, passing transversely across each bright disc. The muscle rods are

751 TEETH. alveolo-dental periosteum, wHch is continuous at themoutli of the socket with the periosteal covering of the jaw and with the deeper fibrous tissue of the gum, where it embraces the neck of the tooth. At the bottom of the socket tlie alveolo-dental periosteum may be seen to have the character of a distinct layer of retiform connective tissue, on the one hand connected with the surface of the cement, on the other with the more fibrous periosteum lining the bony wall of the socket (fig. 207). Higher up the socket, the retiform character of the periosteal connective tissue gradually disappears, but nearer the mouth of the socket it reappears, and the stellate cells form a continuous network with similar cells in the deeper fibrous part of the gum. The alveolo-dental periosteum is vascular, its vessels being continuous with those of the gum, the pulp-vessels, and the bone. It receives nerves from those going to the pulp. The fang fits accurately in the socket, and through a hole at the tip of the fang the blood-vessels and nerves of the tooth pass into the pulp-cavity of the tooth. Structure of the Teeth. Each tooth is composed of the following hard structures â€”dentine, enamel, and cement, or crusta petrosa; occa- sionally other substances, named osteo-dentine or vaso- dentine, are present. In a tooth which has been macerated, an empty space exists in its interior, called the pulp-cavity, which opens externally through the hole at the tip of the fang; but in a living tooth this cavity contains a soft, sensitive substance named the pulp. The Dentine or Ivory makes up the greater part of each

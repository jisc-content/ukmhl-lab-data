S30 ANATOMY. the surrounding lobules. The yellow mass is composed of cells, the protoplasm of which is finely granulated. Some of the cells are spherical in shape, but the greater number are elongated, and uni- or bi-caudate, in the latter case forming thick spindles ; sometimes the caudate processes branch. The yellow mass is very vascular, its vessels being continuous with and derived from those in the wall of the follicle. The larger vessels lie between the lobules, and give rise to an abundant capillary network. The cells of the corpus luteum are derived from the cells of the membrana granulosa, which rapidly multiply and increase in size after the discharge of the ovum. In the course of time the corpus luteum shrivels up and disappears. Where an ovum has become impregnated, the corpus luteum remains for a much longer period than when impregnation has not taken place : the persistence being probably due to the greater flow of blood to the generative organs in the pregnant state, keeping up for a longer period the nutri- tion of the yellow body. The ovum or germ cell is a globular body which attains a diameter of about -jioth inch prior to being extruded from the Graafian follicle. The mature mammalian ovum is an example of a well-formed cell. It possesses a colour- less envelope, the zona pellucida or vitelline membrane, which represents the cell wall: the zona usually seems to be perfectly pellucid; but a finely striated appearance has been described in it, which is believed to indicate the presence of minute pores. Within the zona is the tjelk protoplasm, or cell contents, which contains numerous fatty granules. Imbedded in the yelk is the germinal vesicle or nucleus, about ^th inch in diameter, which

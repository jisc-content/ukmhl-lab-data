CHAPTEE XIII. THE PLACENTA. The impregnated ovum undergoes witMn the cavity of the uterus those structural changes which lead to the development of the embryo, and the formation of the placenta. The placenta is the organ that serves as the medium of connection, during intra-uterine life, between mother and foetus, and in which the physiological pro- cesses take place that are concerned in the nutrition of the foetus. The placenta is a compound organ, and consists of two series of structures, the one belonging to the foetus, the Fcetal Placenta; the other to the mother, the Maternal Placenta. In the diffused form of placenta occurring in the Pig, Mare, Zebra, Cetacea, Manis, Lemurs, and Camels, and in the Cotyledonary form of placenta of the typical Eurainants, the foetal and maternal parts of the placenta can be readily separated from each other. But in the zonary form of placenta occurring in the Caruivora, Hyrax, and the Elephant; in the dome-shaped placenta of the Sloths and in the discoid placenta of the Rodentia, Insec- tivora, Cheiroptera, Quadrumana, and the Human female, the foetal and maternal structures are much more intimately blended with each other. The Fcetal Placenta, is formed of certain membranes,

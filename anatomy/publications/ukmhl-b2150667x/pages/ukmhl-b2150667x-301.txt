INTEKNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 285 of tlie convolutions bounding the Sylvian fissure contains a very large proportion of fusiform cells. They form the chief constituent of the gi'ey claustrum, situated deeper than the grey matter of the island, and separated from the outer part of the corpus striatum by a thin layer of v^hite matter. Fusiform cells also occur abundantly in the nucleus amyg- daloe, a grey mass situated below the corpus striatum, which in some sections seems as if isolated, but in reality is continuous with the grey matter of the inferior temporo- sphenoidal convolution. The grey matter of the cortex of the gyrus hippocampi has its superficial layer formed of nerve fibres, with small and scattered corpuscles, and has been named the nuclear lamina. Next this lamina lies the stratum reticulare, in which the apices of the numerous pyramidal cells, which form the third layer, branch and again unite to form a delicate net- work. This layer of nerve cells is prolonged into the hippocampus major, in which it is rolled on itself in a con- voluted manner. The free surface of the hippocampus, seen in the descending horn of the ventricle, is formed of nerve fibres continuous with the fibres of the taenia hippo- campi Deeper than the pyramidal nerve cells of the hippocampus is a well-marked layer, prolonged also into the fascia dentata, which Meynert has termed the stratum of compressed nerve corpuscles. This layer, however, as was recognised by A. B. Stirling some years ago, resembles the "granules" of the rust coloured layer of the cerebel- lum, and may more appropriately be called the rust-coloured layer of the hippocampus ; each granule consists of a well- defined nucleus invested by deUcate branched protoplasm. . The grey matter of the two layers of the septum luci-

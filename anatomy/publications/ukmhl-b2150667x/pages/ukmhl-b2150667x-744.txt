728 ANATOMY. whilst the posterior part contains a slender fibrous cord formed by the obliteration of a vein of the foetus, named d^ictus venosus. ' The longitudinal fissure is often bridged across by a band of liver substance called pons liepatis. The under surface of the left lobe is smooth, and overlaps the anterior surface of the stomach.

Starting from about the middle of .the longitudinal fissure is the portal or transverse fissure, which extends for from three to four inches across the under surface of the right lobe. It is the gate {porta) of the liver, the hilus or fissure of entrance into the organ of the portal vein,

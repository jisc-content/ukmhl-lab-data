GENERAL CONSIDEEATIONS ON CELLS. 121 venient basis of arrangement for descriptive purposes may be found by dividing tbem into those -which con- sistâ€”1st, of cells suspended in fluids; 2d, of ceUs placed on free surfaces; 3d, of cells imbedded in solid tissues. , , FIEST GKOUP OF TISSUES. Cells Suspended in Fluids. The fluids of the body which have cells or other minute solid particles suspended in them are the blood, the lymph, and the chyle. Sometimes ceUs are found floating in the secretions of glands. The Blood. The blood is the weU-known red fluid which circulates throughout the blood-vascular system. As its general composition and properties have to be considered in physiological rather than anatomical works, the solid particles only, which are suspended in the liquor sanguinis, will be described here. If a drop of human blood be examined under the microscope, crowds of minute bodies, the blood corpuscles, or blood globules, may be seen in it. These present two different appearances, and are dis- tinguished by the names of red and white blood corpuscles. The red corpuscles, which are by far the more numerous, are minute circular discs, slightly concave on both surfaces. Their average diameter is about g^V-o*^ of an inch, and their thickness about |th of that measurement; hence they

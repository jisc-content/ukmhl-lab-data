THE SPLEEN, 663 stellate corpuscles of the reticulum had been filled with injection, so closely does the injected network resemble in form the intervascular network of stellate cells (fig. 155); but it is more probable that the reticulum merely guides the course of the injection, which lies outside the stellate cells, and not within them (fig. 157). The injected stellate network is well marked in the peripheral part of the Mal- pighian bodies, and is continued into their interior, so that the network within the Malpighian body is continuous with that in the surrounding spleen pulp. The veins of the spleen do not arise directly from capillaries, but from the interstices of the intervascular network. The venous radicles are arranged as a close plexus, and possess simple walls, formed apparently of only a single layer of fusiform endothelial cells, so that they were named by Bill- roth cainllary veins. Where they come into relation with the inter- vascular network, it is said that the continuity of their walls is interrupted, their endothelial cells are separated from each other, and assume the character of the retiform connective tissue, and their lumen communicates with the interstices of that network. From the plexus of capillary veins the proper tubular veins arise, which join together to form larger trunks, Fig. 167.â€”^The injected stellate network In the human Spleen pulp, c, an in- jected capillai-y; n, the injected inter- vascular stellate network tinted grey in the figure; s, stellate cells ; ps, the lymphoid corpuscles of the spleen pulp.

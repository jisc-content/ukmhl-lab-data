SYSTEM OF SUPEEIOR VENA CAVA. 503 the chest. It is situated in tLo cavity of the thorax, and is formed by the junction of the two brachio-cephalic veins, about opposite the sternal end of the first intercostal space. It descends on the right of the ascending aorta, pierces the fibrous layer of the pericardium, and opens into the upper and posterior part of the right auricle. Immediately above the pericardium it is joined by the azygos vein (fig. 137). No valve exists either in its course or at its auricular orifice.* The Azygos vein collects the blood vphich has been con- veyed by the intercostal arteries to the posterior part of the walls of the chest. It consists in the lower part of the thorax of two veins, the right and the left azygos. The right azygos, or azygos major, is connected below with the right lumbar veins of thef wall of the abdomen; it enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, ascends on the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae to the right of the thoracic duct and the descending thoracic aorta, and receives in its course the series of right intercostal veins. Opposite the 6th or 7th dorsal vertebras it is joined by the left azygos vein, and higher in the thorax it receives the oesoj^hageal veins, the right bronchial vein, * As an exception to this statement, I may mention that in the year 1868 I dissected the heart of a man in which a semi- lunar valve was placed at the mouth of the superior cava. Shortly afterwards P. D. Handyside published an account of the heart of a male foetus, set 6^ months, in which a semilunar valve was present at the auricular orifice of the superior cava. In 1839 A. P. J. 0. Mayer described two semilunar valves situated close together iu the anterior cava of the dromedary. Vulpian and Philipeaux had seen a valve at the mouth of the right anterior cava in the heart of the elephant, and a similar observation was afterwards made by one of my former assist- ants, M.Watson, on an elephant's heart dissected in the wactical anatomy rooms of the University of Edinburgh.

ANATOMY. 718 of the vagina. The pair of levator muscles not only assist in forming the pelvic floor, but can draw upwards the organs which lie in relation to it. On the same plane as, and continuous with the pos- terior border of each levator ani, is the Goccygeus muscle, which arises from the spine of the ischium, and descends as a thin triangular muscle, to be inserted into the side of the lower end of the sacrum and the side and front of the coccyx. It acts as an elevator of the coccyx. The two pairs of coccygei and levatores ani constitute the pelvic diaphragm. They and the external sphincter are supplied by the fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal nerves. The large intestine is arranged in the abdominal cavity in the form of an arch, the summit of which is the trans- verse colon, whilst the caecum and rectum are the right and left piers. Within the concavity of this arch the coils of the jejunum and ileum are situated. The large intes- tine is not, except in the rectum, a cylindriform tube, but is dilated into three parallel and longitudinal rows of sacculi, which rows are divided from each other by longi- tudinal muscular bands, whilst the sacculi in each row are separated externally by intermediate constrictions. In the rectum the sacculi have disappeared, and the intestine assumes a cylindrical form, but at its lower end it dilates into a reservoir, in which the fsecBS accumulate prior to being excreted. At the junction of the large with the small intestine a valvular arrangement, termed the ileo-coecal or ileo-colic valve, is found. This valve is due to the peculiar manner in which the ileum joins the coecum and colon. If these portions of the large intestine be opened into, it will be

450 ANATOMY. ductor minimi digiti into the deep part of the palm, where it inosculates with the radial artery to form the deep palmar arch; it is accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. h. Recurrent branches, small and inconstant in number, run upwards towards the anterior annular ligament. i. Digital branches, four in number, arise from the con- vexity of the arch; the first runs down the ulnar border of the little finger; the second runs to the cleft between the little and ring fingers, bifurcates, and the branches of bifurcation supply the contiguous borders of those fingers; the third goes to the cleft between the ring and middle, and t\Q fourth to the cleft between the middle and index, where they bifurcate and supply the contiguous borders of their respective digits. Opposite the middle of the ungual phalanx the digital arteries from the two borders of each finger converge, anastomose and form an arch on the palmar surface of the phalanx, from which small branches arise to supply the tip of the finger. The superficial palmar arch is subject to variations in its formation ; the ulnar may not be joined by the super- ficialis volaj, or by the index branch of the radial artery, or the ulnar artery may be relatively small, and the branches of the radial artery may take a larger share in the formation of the arch. The branches which arise either directly or indirectly from the ulnar may be arranged according to their distri- bution in six groups :â€” . \st. To muscles of fore arm : muscular and interosseous. 2d. To bones : nutrient artery.

58 ANATOMY. vomer is developed in the membrane investing the mes-ethmoid cartilage. The human superior maxilla represents not only the superior maxilla of other vertebrates, but the pre-maxiUaiy bone also; but the two bones become fused together at so very early a period that it is difficult to recognise their original independence. In the deformity of hare-lip and cleft palate, they are not unfre- quently separated by a distinct fissure. Since the time when Oken and Goethe propounded the theory that the skull was built up of several vertebra?, the Vertebral Struc- ture of the skull has led to much discussion amongst anatomists. Every one admits that the skull is in series mth the spine, that the cranial cavity is continuous with the spinal canal, and that the cranial vault is formed in the wall of the embryonic cerebro-spinal canal. The skull also, like the spine, is transversely segmented, but whether we regard these segments as vertebrae or not wUl depend upon the conception we entertain of the meaning of the tei-m vertebra. If with Owen we define a vertebra to be "one of those segments of the endo-skeleton which constitute the axis of the body and the protective canals of the nervous and vascular trunks," then we may support the vertebral nature of the cranial segments on the following grounds:—Isi, The presence of a series of bones extending forwards from the foramen magnum along the basis cranii, in series with the bodies of the spinal vertebrae,—e.g., thebasi-occipital, basi-sphenoid, pre-sphenoid, mes-ethmoid (Fig. 7); 2d, The presence of a series of neural arches which enclose and complete the wall of the cranial cavity, and lie in series with the neural arches of the spinal vertebrae,—e.g-., the ex- and supra-occi- pitals, which form the neural arches of the basi-occipital segment; the ali-sphenoids and parietals, which foim the neural arches of the basi-sphenoid segment; the orbito-sphenoids and frontal, which form the neural arches of the pre-sphenoid segment ; the lateral ethmoid and nasal, which form the neural arches of the ethmoid- nasal segment; 3d, The presence of a series of visceral arches of which the mandibular and hyoidean enclose the aUmentary and vas- cular canals, just as the ribs enclose them in the thorax ; and 4th, The presence of foramina between the cranial segments like the inter- vertebral foramina between the spinal vertebra for the transmission of nerves,—e.g, the sphenoidal fissure and the jugular foramen. But if we are to regard a vertebra as a segment of the axial skeleton which in course of its formation passes through a definite series of'developmental changes, then the cranial segments cannot be re<^i-ded as vertebra in the same sense as the spmal segments;

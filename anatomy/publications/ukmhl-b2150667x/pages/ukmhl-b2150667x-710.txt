ANATOMY. 694 branch at their deeper end: they have been called the mucous glands. They are lined by a columnar epithelium, the cells of which at the deeper. end of the gland are more cubical in form, and have a clouded granular appear- ance. The other kind of gland is situated in the remain- ing part of the gastric mucous membrane, and consists of tubes which divide usually into four branches ; they have been named the peptic glands. The cellular lining of these peptic glands closely corre- sponds with the dimorphous arrangement in the human stomach already referred to. The two forms of cells in the deeper branched part of the gland were first observed by KoUiker in the dog, and have since been specially studied by Heidenhain, Kollett, and Frey. According to the last two observers, the axial layer of cells is absent in a certain extent of the gland tube, below the place where the columnar epithelium Fig. 187. — Vertical section n ,i n i t • tiiroufrh tiie Gastric mucous ceases, and the cellular lining membrane of a cat, to sliow . i /• . ■ thetubuiarpepticg lands, c, consists merely 01 a continuous columnar epitlielium near the c . , • n t gland mouth; ft peptic cells; layer 01 pcptlC CClIS.

Hei- coat. denhain states that in a fasting dog the glands are shrunken, and the axial cells are transparent, whilst during digestion the peptic glands are swollen out and the cells are clouded and granular.

CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 155 considerable abundance. The choroid coat of the eyeball owes its dark brown or black colour to the presence of pigment in the interior of the cells. The pigment cells of the choroid are usually polyhedrons, 5 or 6-sided, and are arranged to form a mosaic pattern. In the centre is a nucleus, and the cell substance is occupied by numbers of minute brown granules. In the connective tissue on the outer surface of the choroid, the pig- ment is contained in stellate cells. In fig. 46.-.steiiate pig^ raent cells from tlid the skin of fishes and amphibia, the skin of a codfish, stellate pigment cells branch and subdivide so as to form' highly complex patterns, and the cells are crowded with brown or yellow granules. The production of pigment, either in the interior of epidermal cells, in the poly- hedral cells of the choroid, or in the stellate connective tissue corpuscles, is owing to a special metamorphosis or differentiation of the protoplasm substance of these cells. Caetilaginous Tissue. By the term Cartilage, or cartilaginous tissue, is meant a group of tissues which, though usually found in the form of plates or bars, yet differ in various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters. They agree, however, in forming solid textures, opaque when seen in mass, but translucent, pearly, or bluish white, in thin slices, firm in consistence, but easily cut with a knife, endowed ^vith considerable elasticity, and yielding chondrine on boil- ing. Cartilage is of greater importance in the fcEtus, and in

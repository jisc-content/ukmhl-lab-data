In the superficial fascia, immediately above the internal condyle of the humerus, one or two lymphatic glands are found in the course of the superficial lymph vessels. The deep lymphatics ascend from the palm and accom- pany the radial, ulnar and interosseous arteries in the fore arm. In the upper arm they accompany the brachial artery, and with it enter the axilla. The axillary lymph- glands, about twelve in number, lie in the fat of the axilla, and to them the deep and superficial lymph-vessels of the upper limb proceed. Along the course of the deep brachial lymphatics some small lymphatic glands are sometimes seen. In addition to the lymph-vessels of the upper limb, the axillary glands receive superficial lym- phatics from the anterior thoracic wall and the mam- mary gland, and the superficial lymphatics of the back. From the axillary glands lymph vessels proceed, which accompany the subclavian artery and join on the left side the thoracic duct, on the right side the right lym- phatic duct. The Lymphatics of the Head and Neck are arranged in a superficial and a deep set. The superficial lymphatics of the face accompany the facial vein to the submaxillary region; whilst the superficial lymphatics of the cranium run along with the occipital and temporal blood-vessels to the back and side of the neck. Deep lymphatics accom- pany the internal maxillary vein from the deep parts of

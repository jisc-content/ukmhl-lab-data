605 THORAX. the lungs, so as to expand those organs. Breathing out, or Expiration, consists in the. expulsion from the lungs of a portion of the air which they contained. By the regular alternation of these two acts, during extra-uterine life, the air in the lungs is constantly being renewed, and fresh portions of air are brought into relation with the stream of blood, as it is propelled through the capillaries of the lungs by the action of the right, or pulmonic side, of the heart. The movements of respiration are in a great mea- sure effected by the agency of numerous muscles acting on the osseo-cartilaginous framework of the thorax. A general ^ ' description of the action of these muscles has been already *" given on p. 78. As the lungs occupy a large portion of the cavity of the chest, and have important relations to its walls, it will be advisable, before describing them, to give an account of the construction, shape, and size of the thorax, and to point out the regions into which it is customary to divide it. Thorax. The Cavity of the Thorax or Chest is intermediate in position, in size, and in the extent of mobility of its walls to the cavities of the cranium and abdomen. It contains not only the two lungs and the terminal part of the wind- pipe, but the heart, with the great blood-vessels which pass to and from it, some large nerves, the oesophagus, and the thoracic duct. It is very completely waUed in by bones, cartilages, muscles, membranes, and skin. Thirty-seven bones enter into the formation of the osseous walls of the thorax, viz., 12 dorsal vertebrae,

SPINAL NERVES, S41 branches :â€”An internal cutaneous to the skin of the inner side of the thigh, a middle cutaneous to the skin of the middle of the front of the thigh, and the long saphenous nerve, which supplies the skin of the inner side of the knee- joint, the inner side of the leg and the foot, c. Obturator, also from the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, leaves the pelvis through the obturator foramen, and supplies muscular branches to the obturator externus, gracilis, three adductor muscles of the thigh, and the pectineus; it also supplies articular branches to the hip and knee joints, and not unfrequently gives a cutaneous branch to the skin of the lower part of the inner side of the thigh, d, An Accessory Obturator nerve, also from the 3d and 4th lumbar, is sometimes present, which goes to the pectineus, to the hip-joint, and also joins the obturator nerve. The Lumbosacral Cord is formed of the fifth lumbar nerve and of a branch from the fourth lumbar (Fig. 77). It joins the sacral plexus. Before the junction it gives origin to a communicating and a muscular branch. The Communi- cating joins the fifth lumbar ganglion of the sympathetic. The Muscular branch, or superior glutoeal nerve, supplies the glutseus medius, minimus, and tensor fascise femoris muscles. The Sacral plexus lies in the cavity of the pelvis, and is the largest of all the plexuses. It is formed by the junction of the lumbo-sacral cord, the first, second, third, and part of the fourth sacral nerves, and appears as a flattened mass in front of the sacrum (Fig. 77). It gives origin to com- municating, muscular, and mixed branches. The Com- municating branches join the upper sacral ganglia of the sympathetic system. The Muscular branches supply the Q

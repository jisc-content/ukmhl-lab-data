ANATOMY. 598 aperture of the larynx. These muscles should be examined with reference to their action on the crico-thyroid joints, the crico-arytenoid joints, and the epiglottis. The muscles which act on the crico-thyroid joints are the pair of crico-thyroid muscles and the pair of thyro- arytenoid muscles. The Crico-thyroid muscle arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage as far forward as its anterior middle line; its fasci- culi pass backwards and upwards, and are inserted into the lower border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of its inferior cornu. The two crico- thyroids diverge from each other, and leave uncovered the middle division of the crico-thyroid mem- brane. The Thyro-arytenoid muscle arises from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage close to its retreating angle: it passes al- most horizontally backwards in close relation to the outer wall of the pouch of the larynx and to the true vocal cord, and is inserted into the vocal process at the base of the arytenoid cartilage, into the an- terior surface of the same cartilage, and by a few fibres into the true vocal cord.

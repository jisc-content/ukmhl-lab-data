Meynert states tbat some of the fibres of the crura cerebri end in the nerve cells of the pons, which cells again give origin to fibres that pass outwards to the cerebellum. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum, Little Brain, or After Brain (Figs. 81, 91), occupies the inferior pair of occipital fossae, and, along with, the pons and medulla oblongata, lies below the plane of the tentorium cerebelli. It consists of two hemi- spheres or lateral lobes, and of a median or centrallobe, which in human anatomy is called the vermiform process. It is connected belowwith the meduUa oblongata by the two resti- form bodies which form its inferior peduncles, and above to the corpora quadrigemina of the cerebrum by two bands, which form its superior peduncles; whUst the two hemi- spheres are connected together by the transverse fibres of the pons, which form the middle pedimcles of the cerebellum. On the superior or tentorial surface of the cerebeUum the median or vermiform lobe is a mere elevation (Fig. 91 v), but on its inferior or occipital surface this lobe forms a well-defined inferior vermiform process, which lies at the bottom of a deep fossa or vallecula (Fig. 81); this fossa i^ prolonged to the posterior border of the cerebellum, and forms there a deep notch wHch separates the two hemi- spheres from each other; in this notch the falx cerebeUi is lodged Extending horizontally backwards from the middle cerebral peduncle, along the outer border of each hemisphere is the great horizontal fissure, which divides

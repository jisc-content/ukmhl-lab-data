OVARY. 835 The primordial ovum is converted into [the mature ovum, not only by growing larger, principally by an increased formation of the yelk protoplasm, but by the yelk becoming infiltrated with fatty granules. An invest- ing envelope or zona pellucida is also produced. Eeichert and many other observers supposed that the zona was formed from the cells of the membrana granulosa imme- diately surrounding the ovum, but it is more probably produced by a special differentiation of the peripheral layer of the yelk protoplasm. The germinal vesicle is the modified nucleus of a germ-epithelial corpuscle, and as this nucleus, not only in the unmodified germ epithe- lium cell, but in the early stage of growth of the primor- dial ovum, greatly preponderates in size over its investing protoplasm, it seems at first to be the most important constituent of the cell. About the time of the maturation of an ovum the germinal vesicle has apparently completed its function, for when the Graafian follicle has burst, and the ovum has escaped into the Fallopian tube, the vesicle can no longer be distinguished. The formation of pri- mordial ova from the germ epithelium corpuscles comes to an end before the third year of extra-uterine life. Of the many thousands of primordial ova in each ovary, only a comparatively small number come to maturity, and the maturation of the ova ceases when the function of men- struation terminates.

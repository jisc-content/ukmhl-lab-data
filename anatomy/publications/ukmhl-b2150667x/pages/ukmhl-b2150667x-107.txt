JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”UPPER LIMB. 91 slmiffainff the shoulders, is due to the contraction of the trapezius, levator scapula, and rhomboideus; depression partly to the weight of the hmb and partly to the action of the subclavius and pectoralis minor; movement forward to the serratus and pectoralis; and backward to the trapezius and rhomboid. In rotation of the scapula on the clavicle, the inferior angle of the scapula is drawn forward by the serratus and lower fibres of trapezius, and backward by the levator scapulae, rhomboid, and lesser pectoral. The Shoidder Joint is a ball-and-socket joint, the ball being the head of the humerus, the socket the glenoid fossa of the scapula. A large capsular ligament, which is pierced by the long tendon of the biceps muscle, and Hned by a synovial membrane, encloses the articular ends of the two bones, and is so loose as to permit a range of movement greater than takes place in any other joint in the body. The muscles which cause these movements are inserted into the humerus; the supra-spinatus, infra- spinatus, and teres minor into the great tuberosity; the sub-scapularis into the small tuberosity; the latissimus dorsi and teres major into the bottom of the bicipital groove; the pectoralis major iuto its anterior border; the coraco-brachialis into the inner aspect of the shaft, and the deltoid, which forms the fleshy prominence of the shoulder, into the outer aspect of the shaft. Abduction and elevation, or extension of the arm outwards at the shoulder joint, are due to the supra-spinatus and deltoid; adduction or depression, to the coraco-brachialis, latissi- mus, and teres major, assisted by the weight of the hmb; movement forwards and elevation, to the anterior fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis, and subscapularis; back-

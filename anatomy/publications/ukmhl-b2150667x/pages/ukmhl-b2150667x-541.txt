POETAL .VENOUS SYSTEM. 525 vein. Moreover, he described a network of small veins lying in the areolar tissue outside the peritoneum, which communicated on the one hand with the veins of the colon, and on the other with the renal veins, the pelvic veins, and other rootlets of the inferior vena cava. This network evidently corresponds with the extra-peritoneal arterial net- work, which I have injected and described in the same locality (p. 433), as connecting together the parietal and visceral branches of the abdominal aorta. Schiff and Luschka have also described, by the name of vena parum- hilicalis, a small vein, which is connected on the one hand with the deep epigastric vein, a rootlet of the external iliac, and on the other with the portal vein; this vein ascends to the liver along with the round ligament. Cases of occasional enlargement of this vein have been described by Monro, Eokitansky, Champneys, and others. The inos- culations described on p. 515 between the spinal veins and the lumbar and intercostal veins, establish a communication between the circulation in the spinal cord and that in the parietes of the chest and abdomen. These venous and arterial anastomoses have an interest and importance in connection with the practice of local blood-letting by cupping or leeching the abdominal wall.

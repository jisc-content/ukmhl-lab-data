133 EPITHELIUM. vestment of the skin. Its cells are nucleated, flattened scales, varying in diameter from ^^otli to -ro^o-th inch. Those in the same layer, being in contact by their edges, form a tessellated, pavement-like arrangement, whilst the cells in adjacent layers have their flattened surfaces in con- tact with each other. Sometimes the cells have ja,gged, prickle-like edges, or fluted surfaces, and usually they con- tain scattered granular particles. In the formation of this epithelium a morphological difi"erentiation of the protoplasm of the rounded cells of the deeper strata into flattened scales, and at the same time a chemical difi'erentiation of their soft contents into a horny material, have occurred. Columnar or cylindrical epithelium is situated on the free surface of the mucous lining of the alimentary canal from the oesophageal orifice of the stomach to the anus ; it is prolonged into the ducts of various glands which open on the ahmentary mucous membrane; it covers the mucous lining of the urethra and the mucous membrane of the gall bladder. Its ceUs are elongated, cylindrical columns, about ^i-oth inch long, placed side by side Hke a row of palisades, and with their long axes perpendicular ry^^S^ W^^^^M^^f to the surface on which ^o^'^^^^ ^^P^ ^mII^P*'^ the cells rest.

ANATOMY. 86 pharynx are continuous with each other, whilst in front the buccinator blends with the structures in the Hps. It compresses the cheeks, and drives the air out of the cavity of the mouth as in playing a wind instrument; hence the name, " trumpeter's muscle." The aperture of communication between the mouth and pharynx is named the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded below by the root of the tongue, on each side by the tonsils, and above by the soft palate. The soft palate is a structure which hangs pendulous from the posterior edge of the hard bony palate. From its centre depends an elongated body, the uvula, and from each of its sides two folds extend, one downwards and forwards to the tongue, the other down- wards and backwards to the pharynx. These folds are called the anterior and jjosterior jjillars of the fauces or palate. Between the anterior and posterior pillar, on each side, the tonsil is seated. The soft palate and its pillars are invested by the mucous lining of the mouth and pharynx, and contain small but important muscles. The muscles of the soft palate and uvula, termed the elevators and tensors, raise and make them tense during the process of deglutition. The muscles of the posterior pillars, or palato-pharyngei, by their contraction, approximate the waUs of the pharynx to the soft palate and uvula, whilst the muscles of the anterior pillars, or palato-glossi, diminish the size of the fauces. The pharynx is a tube with muscular walls, lined by a mucous membrane, which communicates above and in front with the cavities of the nose, mouth, and larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the oesophagus or gullet. It serves as the chamber or passage down which the food goes from the mouth to the oesophagus in the act of

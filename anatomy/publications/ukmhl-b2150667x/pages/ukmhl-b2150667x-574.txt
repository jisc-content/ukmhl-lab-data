ANATOMY. 558 trabecles of this framework, possess a similar fibro- elastic and muscular structure to that of the fibrous coat. The blood-vessels ramify in the interior of the spleen in close relation to the trabecles. The intervals between the trabecles are irregular in form and size, and are occupied by a soft reddish substance, the spleen pulp. If a section be made through the spleen, and a current of water be directed on the surface of the section, the spleen pulp is easily washed out of these inter- vals, and the trabecular framework is left. The examination of the more minute structure of the spleen is attended with many difficulties, more especially as regards the mode of ter- mination of the splenic artery, the commencement of the vein, and the relation of the splenic blood-vessels to the spleen pulp. When the pulp is examined micro- scopically, it is seen to contain fine blood-vessels, spheroidal bodies called the Malpighian corpuscles, nu- merous cells, and a delicate reticvdum of connective tissue.

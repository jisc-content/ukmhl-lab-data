ANATOMY. 362 it may be recognised a head separated by a constricted neck from an elongated handle. Close to the junction of the neck and handle a long slender process projects downwards and forwards to be inserted into the Glaserian fissure, and near the root of the long process a short process projects outwards. By its handle the malleus is intimately con- nected with the centre of the membrana tympani; by its head it articulates with the incus; whilst ligamentous fibres pass from it upwards, forwards, outwards, and backwards to the tympanic walls. The Incus, or anvil-shaped bone, possesses a body and two processes; on the anterior surface of the body is a saddle-shaped hollow in which the head of the malleus fits; the short process projects almost horizontally backwards, and is attached by a ligament to the posterior waU of the tympanum; the long process extends at first down- wards and then inwards, to end in a rounded projection, named os orUculare, through which it articulates with the stapes. The Stapes, or stirrup-shaped bone, possesses a head and neck, a base and two crura; the head articulates with the OS orbiculare of the incus; from the constricted neck the two crura curve inwards to the base, which is attached to the fenestra ovalis. The joint between the malleus and incus is diarthrodial and saddle-shaped, and the articular surfaces are enclosed by a capsular ligament. The joint between the incus and stapes is also diarthrodial, and pos- sesses an investing capsular Ugament. Toynbee and Kiid- inger have described the base of the stapes and the margin of the fenestra ovalis as each invested by hyaUne cartUage Between these plates elastic fibres extend in a plexiform

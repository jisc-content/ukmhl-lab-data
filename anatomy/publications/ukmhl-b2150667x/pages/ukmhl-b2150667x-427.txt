THE HEAET. 411 scribed fibres beneath the endocardium, which are now reo-arded as imperfectly formed striated muscular fibres. The valves are folds of the endocardium, enclosing fibres continuous with those in the fibrous rings; the cuspidate auriculo-ventricular valves receive fibres from the chordss tendinese, and muscular fibres, continuous with those of the auricles, are prolonged for a short distance into the cusps. The semilunar and cuspidate valves are vascular; fine arteries, derived from the coronary, pass between the two layers of each valve, and terminate in a capillary plexus. The heart is well supplied with blood, not by the blood which flows through its cavities, but by two special coro- nary arteries which ramify in its walls, and end in nume- rous capillaries lying between the fibres. From these capillaries the coronary veins arise, which join to form the coronary venous sinus. Lymphatic vessels occur both in the endocardium and pericardium, and apparently ramify in the muscular wall. The nerves of the heart have been dissected especially by Scarpa, Eemak, Lee, and Pettigrew, and numerous small ganglia described in connection with them (p. 317). The blood flows from the capillary networks along the great veins into the auricles ; the systemic veins convey it into the right auricle, the pulmonary veins into the left. The blood is then propelled by the contraction of the muscular walls of the auricles through the auriculo-ventri- cular openings, the valves of which open outwards, into the ventricles. When the ventricles are distended, their mus- cular walls contract and force the blood into the arteries— the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, the left into the aorta—the valves at the mouth of each artery opening

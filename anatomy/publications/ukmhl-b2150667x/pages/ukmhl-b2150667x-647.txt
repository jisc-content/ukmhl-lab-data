631 THE LUNGS. nervous plexus is at the frout of the root of the lung. Some areolar tissue connects these various objects together, and the whole are surrounded by the pleural membrane, as it passes from the region of the mediastinum to become continuous with the pulmonic pleura. The vena azygos arches above the root of the right lung: the aorta above that of the left. The phrenic nerve passes in front of the root of each lung, but the root of the right lung has also the superior vena cava in front of it. The nervus vagus descends behind the root of each lung, but the root of the left lung has also the descending thoracic aorta behind it. The lungs are light, spongy organs, and contain, after the child has begun to breathe, a quantity of air, so that they float on water. When roughly handled they crepitate, or emit a crackling sound, owing to the air being squeezed out of the air vesicles by the pressure of the fingers. Before the birth of the child they are dense and compact, and sink in water. They are highly vascular, and in the child possess a pink colour. In the adult they are bluish-grey, or slate-coloured, or even mottled with black spots, owing to the formation or deposition of colouring matter in their substance. Their size varies not only with the period of life, but with the degree of inflation with air. Their weight after death also varies, in relation to the amount of blood or mucus they may contain. The average weight of both lungs is about 40 oz., and the right lung is some- what heavier than the left.

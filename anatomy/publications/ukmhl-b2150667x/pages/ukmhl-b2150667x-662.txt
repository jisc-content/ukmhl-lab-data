AXATOMY. 646 THE MOUTH. The Mouth, Oral cavity, or Buccal cavity, is the dilatecl commencement of the alimentary canal, in which the food is masticated and mingled with the secretion of the salivary and mucous glands. It is situated in the face, and extends from the lips in front, to the pharynx behind. It is bounded above by the hard and soft palate, with the uvula; below by the lower jaw, the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, and the tongue; on each side by the cheek: and in front by the lips, between which is the aperture of communication with the surface of the face. Behind it freely communicates with the pharynx through the isthmus faucium, posterior buccal, or pharyngo- oral orifice. The muscles which enter into the formation of the walls of the mouth are situated in the lips, clieeks, floor of the mouth, tongue, and soft palate. The muscles of the Lips are as follows :â€” Orbicularis, or SpUncter oris, surrounds the orifice of the mouth, and forms a large part of the muscular sub- stance of the lips. The fasciculi form a series of ellipses, of which those next the margins of the lips are finer and paler than those that lie further from the margins. The fasciculi in the upper lip are prolonged into those in the lower round the corners of the mouth. The outer border of the muscle blends with the other muscles of the lips : in the upper lip this border is attached by a slip to the septal cartilage of the nose, and by two other slips to the incisive fossa3 in the upper jaw ; in the lower lip it is

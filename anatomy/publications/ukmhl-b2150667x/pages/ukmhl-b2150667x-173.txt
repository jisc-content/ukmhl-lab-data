157 CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. size, are sometimes rounded, but more usually compressed laterally. The nucleus is often very distinct, though at other times more difficult to detect, and the cell wall is well marked. Sometimes a little intercellular substance is found. By some anatomists the chorda dorsalis is regarded as a variety of connective tissue, and not of cartilage. The cartilaginous framework of the ear of some small mammals—as the mouse, the bat, and the rat—is formed of cellular cartilage, the cells of which are smaller in size than those of the chorda dorsalis, irregularly poly- gonal, and closely packed together so as to form a solid tissue. The Hyaline Cartilage consists of cells imbedded in a peUucid or fig. 48.—CeUs of the cartilagi- nous framework of the ear hyaline matrix, which, under some "f the mouse, conditions, however, may assume a dimly granulated ap- pearance. The xiphoid and costal cartilages, the encrusting cartilages at the articular ends of the bones, the car- tilages of ; the nose, those of the windpipe, except the epiglottis and cornicula la- ryngis, belong to this variety, as also the temporary car- tilages. In hyaline cartilage s^^i^ne costal cartoage. the ceUs are ovoid or polygonal, or even fusiform, and sometimes flattened, the flattened form of ceU being found next the surface of the cartilage. They lie singly, or in groups of two, or three, or four; sometimes they are arranged in linear series, at other times they are

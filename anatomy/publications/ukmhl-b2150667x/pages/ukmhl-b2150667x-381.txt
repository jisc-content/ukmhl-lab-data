THE EAK. 365 vestibiUe, semicircular canals, and cochlea, each of which consists of an osseous and a membranous portion. The Vestibule hes immediately internal to the tympanum, between it and the bottom of the internal auditory meatus; behind the vestibule are the semicircular canals, and in front is situated the cochlea. It is the part of the labyrinth which first appears in animals, and is therefore the most constant part of the organ. In the myxinoid fishes a single semicircu- lar canal is superadded to the vestibule, in the lamprey two canals, but in other fishes and in the higher vertebrates three canals exist. In amphibia, reptiles, and birds the cochlea is small and rudimentary in comparison with its develop- ment in mammals. The osseous vestibule is an ovoid chamber about -^th inch in diameter. In its outer or tympanic waU is the fenestra ovalis ; in its inner are small auditory foramina, which transmit from the internal meatus the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve; behind these holes is the opening of a minute canal, the aqueductus vestihuli; its anterior wall communicates with the scala vestibuli of the cochlea, and into its posterior wall open the five orifices of the three semicircular canals. The Semicircular Canals are named superior, posterior, and external The superior and posterior are sometimes caUed the vertical canals, and the external the horizontal canal, but, as Crum Brown has shown, the superior and posterior lie in planes nearly equally inclined to the mesial plane of the head, and the external is in a plane at right angles to the mesial plane. Further, the canals in the two ears have definite relations to each other; forwhUst the superior canal of each ear is nearly paraUel to the posterior â€¢ canal of the other, the external canals in both ears lie

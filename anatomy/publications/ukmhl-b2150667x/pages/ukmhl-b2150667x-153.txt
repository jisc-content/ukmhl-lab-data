137 EPITHELIUM. columnar and scaly varieties; and in many glands the continuity of the epithelial layer from the spheroidal epi- thehum of the gland-follicles to the columnar epithelium of the gland-ducts is preserved by the interposition of inter- mediate transitional forms of cells. The epithelial surfaces of the upper part of the mucous lining of the nose and of the back of the tongue are specially modified in connection "with the senses of smell and taste localised in those regions, as will afterwards be considered when their anatomy is described. Both the upper germinal layer, or epiblast, and the under, or hypoblast layer of the embryo serve as surfaces of origin for epithehal cells, and it is believed that the epithelial covering of the genito-urinary mucous membrane is derived from a difi"erentiation of certain of the cells of the middle germinal layer or mesoblast. The cells of the hypoblast give origin to the epithelium of the alimentary canal below the mouth, and to the epitheliumi of the various glands which open into this part of the digestive tract; also to the epithelial lining of the windpipe and air cells. The cells of the epiblast give origin to the epidermal covering of the skin, the epithelial lining of the sweat glands, seba- ceous glands, and mammae, which open on the surface of the skin; also to the epithelial lining of the mouth and the salivary glands opening into it; also to the epithelial lining of the nose and of the glands connected with its mucous membrane. But, further, the epithehal cells lining the cerebral ventricles, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the membranous labyrinth, are primarily derived fr om the cells of the epiblast. For though these canals and spaces are, when development is completed, shut off from all con-

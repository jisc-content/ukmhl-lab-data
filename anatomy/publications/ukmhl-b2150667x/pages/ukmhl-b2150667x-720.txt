ANATOMY. 704 attached cells are minute supplementary cells, sometimes globular in shape, at others elongated and somewhat cau- date. Scattered amidst the columnar cells are cells which possess the form of microscopic goblets, and are named gohlet cells. The free end of each goblet cell appears to have an open mouth on the surface of the villus, through which a mucous-like substance exudes. Various opinions have been expressed as to the nature of these goblet cells. Some regard them as special structures engaged either in the absorption of chyle, or the secretion of mucus : others look upon them as merely modifications of the columnar epithelium : whilst others again consider them to be post- mortem productions, due to the swelling out of the columnar epithelium by the imbibition of fluid. There can be no doubt, however, that they are not specially concerned in the absorption of chyle, as cells of the same character are found in the respiratory mucous membrane, and on other surfaces, where the absorption of chyle does not take place. The sub-epithelial tissue of a vUlus forms its matrix or basis substance, and consists of the sub-epithelial connective tissue of the mucous membrane. When thin sections through a villus are examined, the matrix is seen to be composed not of areolar tissue, but of a delicate retiform tissue, which forms a network, between the periphery of the matrix and the wall of the chyle vessel, and in the meshes of this network numbers of colourless lymphoid corpuscles are imbedded. These cells were described and figured by Goodsir, as the absorbing cells or vesicles of the villus. Immediately beneath the epithelium, the matrix appears, from Krause's observations, as if its corpuscles were flat-

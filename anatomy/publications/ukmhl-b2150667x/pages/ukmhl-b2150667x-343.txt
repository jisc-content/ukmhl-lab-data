THE NOSE. 327' bundles of fine non-medullated fibres arise that enter the mucous membrane and run between tlie glands into the epithelial layer. These nerves have a varicose appearance, and though their terminations have not been precisely ascertained, it is believed that they are connected with the varicose central processes of the olfactory cells, which cells are therefore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the olfactory nerve fibres. The mucous membrane of the nose also receives branches from the 1st and 2d divisions of the 5th cranial nerve. Their mode of termination in that membrane is not known, but they are associated with the sense of touch, and not with the special sense of smell. The nose appears on the face of the embryo in the form of two little depressions in the epiblast, the nasal pits, one on each side of the mesial plane. Each pit is superficial to the olfactory bulb prolonged forward from the corre- sponding hemisphere vesicle, and lies between the fronto- nasal process and the maxillary process in the embryo head. At first the rudimentary nasal chambers freely communicate with the cavity of the mouth; but by the growth inwards to the mesial line of the palate of the palatal processes of the superior maxillary lobes, the cavity of the mouth is shut off from the nose, except where the incisive canals remain pervious in the anterior part of the upper jaw bones. As the nasal pits are lined by an involution of the epiblast, the epithelial lining of the nose, including the olfactory cells, is derived from the epiblast cells. The osseo-cartilaginous framework of the nose is produced by a differentiation of the mesoblast, and in all probability the olfactory nerve fibres distributed to the mucous membrane are also derived from the mesoblast.

The trabecles are arranged in a cylindriform manner, and enclose alveoli, which contain lymph follicles that possess a cylindrical form. Here also, as in the cortex, the lymphoid tissue of the follicles within adjacent Kir 152â€”Semi-diasrammatic view of the meduUary part and the hilus of a LVmplmtteGland^ As, stroma of hilus ve, vas eflere^s; a, artery ending n capTuaries; c, capsule; tt, traheculai; pp, lymph passage; /, follicles, highly magnified. alveoli is continuous through gaps in the intervening trabecular wall. The meduUary lymph foUicles are sur- rounded by lymph passages, continuous, on the one hand, with the lymph passages in the cortical part of the gland, and on the other, with the vasa efferentia, with which the medullary substance comes into direct relation at the hilus. The medullary lymph passages can be injected from the vasa efferentia. The surfaces of the trabeculse which bound the lymph passages both in the cortex and medulla are covered by a layer of endothelial cells con-

151 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. arises along witli the central nervous axis from the cells of the epiblast; and its tissue remains mostly as a granular nucleated protoplasm, though a delicate fibrillation may sometimes be seen in it. In the retiform connective tissue the cells have assumed a stellate shape, and their branches anastomose. In the gelatinous and fibrous form an intercellular matrix is extensively produced, and exhi- bits a differentiation into fibres. In these last-named forms, which are the most characteristic varieties of the tissue, the cells of the mesoblast change their form, and assume a fusiform, caudate, or stellate shape; and, sub- sequently a delicate fibriUated structure appears between them, which assimies the characters of the bundles of white fibrous tissue, and by separating the cells from each other forms the fibrous intercellular matrix. It has been much disputed whether these white fibres take their rise immediately from the peripheral portion of the cells by a direct differentiation of their protoplasm, or whether this protoplasm is not in the first instance converted into a homogeneous matrix in which the fibrous differentiation then occurs. There can be no doubt that the fibres are formed by a metamorphosis of the protoplasm of the cells; whether the metamorphosis takes place directly, or through the intermediate stage of a homogeneous matrix, is a secondary question, and in all probability both modes of conversion take place at different times and in different localities. As the differentiation into fibres progresses, the tissue becomes firmer and tougher, and the propor- tion of the cellular to the fibrous element diminishes. Hence, say in a young tendon, the rows of connective tissue cells are not only closer together, but are much

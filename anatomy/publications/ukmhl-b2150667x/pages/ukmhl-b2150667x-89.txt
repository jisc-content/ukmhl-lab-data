AETICULATOEY AND MUSCULAE SYSTEMS. 73 aponeurosis, but special descriptive names are given to it in the different regionsâ€”e.g., cervical fascia, brachial aponeurosis, fascia lata, or fascia of the thigh. In some localities muscles arise from the fascia, and in others they are inserted into it. The fascia is separated from the skin by a layer of subcutaneous fatty tissue, the superficial fascia, and in this layer muscles are in some localities de- veloped. In the fat of the inner border of the palm of the hand a small muscle, the palmaris hrevis, is found, which is inserted into the skin covering the baU of the little finger; at each side of the neck, also, lies a thin muscle caUed platysma myoides, and the muscles on the face and scalp which move the skin of the face and head belong to the same category. These muscles belong to the group of sub-cutaneous or dermal muscles, which, except in the locali- ties above referred to, is not represented in the human' body, but is well known in the bodies of the mammalia generally as the panniculus carnosus. In arranging the muscles for descriptive purposes, either a morphological, a topographical, or a physiological method maybe pursued. The morphological arrangement is to be preferred when the object is to compare the muscular system in man with that in different animals, and the basis of the arrangement should be into muscles of the axial, the appendicular, and the axi-appendicular skeletons, and sub-cutaneous muscles; a topographical arrangement is most suitable for the purposes of the practical surgeon; a physio- logical arrangement, when the object is to study the action of the muscles in connection with the movements of the joints.

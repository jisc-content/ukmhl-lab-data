790 ANATOMY. The wall of Bowman's capsule is extremely thia, and according to Ludwig consists of a layer of flattened cells, on the outer surface of which is a little connective tissue. These cells form the lining epithelium of the capsule. The glomerulus occupies the interior of the capsule, but is not adherent to its wall. By most observers it is believed that the epithelial lining of the capsule is reflected on the surface of the glomerulus, to form a covering for it, con- sisting of granulated cells, smaller and somewhat thicker than those of the epithelial lining of the capsule. By other observers again, the demonstration of the cellular covering of the glomerulus is not considered to have been satisfactorily established. From the observations of Seng and of Walter Pye, not only the entire glomerulus, but the several subdivisions of the tuft, are in the fcetal kidney invested by epithelial cells. As Bowman's capsule is pro- duced by a folding of the wall of the foetal tubule over the glomerulus, the cells which cover the tuft are the epi- thelium of the foetal urinary tubule. The capillaries, which lie in the stroma between the convoluted tubules, form a network around these tubules, which joins the capillary network around the straight tubules of the medullary rays, so that the capillaries form a continuous plexus throughout the cortex. Ac- cording to Ludwig, lacuniform spaces, often filled with fluid, intervene between the wall of the capillaries and that of the urinary tubes. Minute veins arise from this capillary plexus. Those that arise from the capillaries surrounding the tubules at the free surface of the cortex, are arranged in a star-like manner, and form the vence stellatce, which also receive small veins from the fibrous

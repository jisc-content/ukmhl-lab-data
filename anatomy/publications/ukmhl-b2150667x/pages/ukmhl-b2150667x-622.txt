606 ANATOMY. 12 pairs of ribs, and tlie sternum. The dorsal vertebrse are situated in the middle of its posterior wall. Their bodies are united together by the intervertebral discs, and anterior and posterior common ligaments ; their articular processes by capsular ligaments; their laminae by the ligamenta subflava; and their spines by the sapra and inter spinous ligaments. The sternum is situated in the middle of the anterior wall of the chest. It consists of three pieces, which ultimately fuse together into a single bone. The twelve ribs on each side are articulated behind to the dorsal vertebras. They project at first backwards, down- wards, and outwards ; they then arch downwards, forwards, and inwards, and are continuous at their anterior ends with the costal cartilages. The first costal cartilage prolongs the first rib downwards and inwards to the side of the manubrium sterni. The second continues the second rib horizontally inwards to the side of the joint between the manubrium and body of the sternum. The cartilages of the third rib to the tenth inclusive slope upwards and inwards, and become gradually more vertical in their direction, as one passes downwards in the series. The cartilaginous termination of the seven upper ribs, on each side articulate with the side of the sternum. The cartila- ginous terminations of the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs do not reach the side of the sternum; but as they are jointed together, and as the eighth cartUage is jointed with the seventh, the seventh to the sixth, and the sixth to the fifth, they are indirectly connected to that bone, and the movements of the ribs, of which they are the terminations, can thus influence the movements of the sternum. The cartilaginous terminations of the eleventh and twelfth ribs

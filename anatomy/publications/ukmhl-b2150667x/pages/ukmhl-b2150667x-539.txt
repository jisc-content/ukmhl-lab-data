523 POETAL VENOUS SYSTEM. the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal venous trunk. It receives in its course the short gastric vein from the stomach, the left gastro-epiploic vein, pancreatic and duodenal veins, and the inferior mesenteric vein. E. Crisp has described valves in both the splenic and mesenteric veins. The CoEONARY vein runs along the small curvature of the stomach and joins the portal venous trunk near its origin. The Cystic vein proceeds from the gall bladder, and joins either the portal venous trunk near the liver, or its right branch of bifurcation. The Portal Venous Teunk, or Portal Vein, is formed by the union, behind the pancreas, of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. It passes obliquely upwards and to the right, between the two layers of the small omentum, behind and between the hepatic artery and com- mon bile duct, to reach the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into a right and a left branch. These branches enter the right and left lobes of the liver, in which they divide and subdivide after the manner of an artery, and end in the intra-lobular capillary plexus, from which the rootlets of the hepatic vein arise. Although the portal venous system is sometimes regarded as distinct from the system of the inferior cava, except through the channel of communication provided by the hepatic vein, yet anastomoses between the two systems, do undoubtedly occur in connection with certain of their peripheral ramifications. It has already been stated (p. 519) that the hsemorrhoidal plexus is continuous with the rootlets of both systems. The elder Eetzius observed

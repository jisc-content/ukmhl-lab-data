656 ANATOMY. The Sublingual is the smallest of the salivary glands, and lies under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, close to the genio-hyo-glossus muscle and the line of attachment of the fra3num linguae. It is concealed by the mylo-hyoid muscle, and receives, as its arteries of supply, the sublingual branch of the lingual artery and small branches of the submental branch of the facial artery. In- stead of having, like the parotid or the submaxillary gland, only a single excretory duct, it possesses from ten to twenty small ducts, the ducts of Rivinus, some of which join Wharton's duct, though the greater number open directly into the floor of the mouth near the frtenum linguse. Structure.â€”The ducts of the salivary glands branch and terminate in the lobules; each terminal duct ending in a series of saccular dilatations, the acini, alveoli, or gland- vesicles, the wall of which, formed apparently of a mem- brana propria, is continuous with the simple membranous wall of the terminal duct. The terminal ducts are lined by a layer of squamous epithelium. The waD of the larger ducts is formed of white and yellow fibrous tissue, with, in some instances, contractile muscular fibre-cells, and is lined by a columnar epithelium. The gland vesicles contain the secreting cells, which present two different histological appearances. The cells which lie in the centre of the alveolus approach the spheroidal in form, though with the sides often flattened; their protoplasm is granulated, though it may clear up, apparently from a mucous change in its substance; their nucleus is distinct, and usually close to the circumference of the cell. The cells which lie next the wall of the vesicle are smaller, with a more granulated protoplasm, and on

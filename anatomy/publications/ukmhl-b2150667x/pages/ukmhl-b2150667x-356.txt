The ciliary nerves then enter the ciliary muscle, and form plexuses with interspersed nerve cells, from which branches pass to the muscular fibres. Other branches of the ciliary nerves enter the iris, and form plexuses, from which branches proceed to the muscular tissue. THE INNER OR NERVOUS TUNIC.

In the living eye it is translucent and colour- less but shortly after death it becomes grey : it is soft and so easily torn that it is difficult to display it in a dissection without injury. Its inner or anterior surface, concave forwards, is moulded on the vitreous body, and presents the foUowing appearances :-Almost exactly in the antero^ posterior axis of the eyeball is a transversely oval yellov^ spot, about ,Vh inch in its long diameter which amongst mammals is found only in man and apes, though, as Knox and Hulke have shown, it exists in reptiles; m the centre

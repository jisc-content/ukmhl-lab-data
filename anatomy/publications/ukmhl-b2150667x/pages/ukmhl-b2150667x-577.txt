THE SPLEEN. 561 fibrous coat of the spleen. An important metamorphosis takes place in the structure both of the sheath, and of the tunica adventitia of the smaller branches of the artery, which lose their fibro-elastic character, and become trans- formed into lymphoid tissue.

X 80. In many localities this lymphoid tissue increases so much in amount, as to form minute spheroidal or elliptical bodies—the spleen-follicles—-just visible to the naked eye, and long known as the Malinghian bodies or corpuscles. Each of these bodies is therefore developed in relation to the wall of an artery. When the development takes place around the entire circumference of the wall, the Malpighian body is penetrated by the artery, which seems to form therefore its peduncle or stalk; the passage of the minute arteries into and through the Malpighian bodies was first pointed out by W. R. Sanders; when the forma- tion of the Malpighian body is limited to one aspect only of the wall of the artery, then it is sessile on the vessel. At one time it was thought that each Malpighian

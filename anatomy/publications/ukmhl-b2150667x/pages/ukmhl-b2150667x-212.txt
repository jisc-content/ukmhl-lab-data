Lister and I pointed out, in 1859, that essential differences in chemical composition existed between the axial cyUnder and the medullary sheath ; the former being unaffected by chromic acid, though the latter is rendered opaque and brown, and concentrically striated under its influence; while, on the other hand, the axial cyhnder is stained red by an ammoniacal solution of carmine with great facility, although the medullary sheath is unaffected by it. We further showed that these differences in the mode of action of chromic acid and carmine might advantageously be employed in the demonstration of the structure of nerve fibres. Ranke has subsequently stated that the axial cylinder possesses an acid, and the meduUary sheath an alkaUne reaction. The presence of a layer of flat cells between the primitive membrane and the white meduUary substance has recently been described by Thin. MeduUated nerve fibres vary materiaUy in diameter in different parts of the nervous system. In the brain, for instance, they are sometimes as fine as the 1-^00*^ ^^^'> whilst, in the distributory nerves, fibres of -^ots^'^^ of an inch in diameter may be seen ; though it should be stated that even in the nerves of distribution, fibres of great minuteness are often placed in the same bundle with those of the largest size. Nerve fibres do not branch m their course but only at their central or peripheral termmations, and much more frequently at the latter than the former.

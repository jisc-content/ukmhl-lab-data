WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 299 weigM may be obtained with a fair measure of accuracy, the following facts are derived:—The average weight of the male brain in the African races is 45'6 oz.; of the female brain, 42*7 oz.: the average weight of the male brain in the Australian races is 42-8 oz.; of the female brain, 39"2 oz.: the average weight of the male brain in the Oceanic races, 46'5 oz.; of the female brain, 43 oz. The conclusions which may legitimately be drawn from an analysis of Barnard Davis's observations are as follows :— 1st, That the average brain weight is considerably higher in the civilised European than in the savage races; 2d, That the range of variation is much greater in the former than in the latter; 3d, That there is an absence, almost complete, of specimens heavier than 64 oz. in the exotic races, so that the higher terms of the series are not repre- sented ; 4th, That though the male brains are heavier than the female, there is not the same amount of difference in the average brain weight between the two sexes in the uncultivated as in the cultivated peoples. No rehable determinations have as yet been made of the exact proportion, as regards bulk and weight, which the convolutions bear to the corpora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina, but data are obtainable of the rela- tive weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla to the entire encephalon. Between the ages of 20 and 70 the ratio of weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla, to the entire brain, is as 1 to 7-9, or about 13 to 100, and this relative weight is virtually the same in both sexes. From Peacock's observations the ratio of weight of the cerebel- lum alone to the entire encephalon is as 1 to 9, or about 11 to 100.

149 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Beale Has shown, are not unfrequently seen in the elastic fibres in beef and mutton wMch have passed through the alimentary canal. Bearing on the mode of nutrition of the tendons, and other fibrous forms of connective tissues, minute plasma or juice spaces and canals have been described, along which, not blood, but the liquor sanguinis is supposed to flow. Virchow conceived that the connective tissue cor- puscles formed an anastomosing network for this purpose. Briicke believed that delicate channels or lacuna existed between the bundles of connective tissue, whilst Reckling- hausen maintained that the canaHculi were situated in the homogeneous substance which connects the fibrous fasciculi and lamellae of the connective tissue with each other. These lacuna or canaUcuH are, in all probability, the root- lets of origin of the lymphatic system of vessels, and ]Mihalkovics and Thin maintain that their walls are formed by the flat endothelial-like cells which invest the bundles of connective tissue. Kanvier even suggests that the spaces between the connective tissue bundles, walled in by these cells, form a close system analogous to the serous cavities. There can indeed be no doubt, as the recent iiijections of Ludwig and Schweigger-Seidel have shown, that tendons and fasciae are well provided with lymph vessels, for they have injected in them a minute network, consisting in part of polygonal meshes, and in part of vessels running longi- tudmally and parallel to the connective tissue bundles, and the walls of these vessels were formed of endothelial cells. Recklinghausen and others have recently described cor- puscles in the connective tissue which resemble in size and appearance the white corpuscles of the blood and lymph.

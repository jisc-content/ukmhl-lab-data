NERVOUS TISSUE. 205 having entered the nucleus, the fibril again gives off a filament, which passes out of the cell to join the intra- muscular plexus; the ending of the nerve, therefore, within the nucleus is only apparent, and is rather to be regarded as the nodal point of a fine intra-nuclear plexus. The termination of the sensory nerves in the mucous mem- branes has been especially studied in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the soft palate, and the glans of the penis and clitoris. In these parts Krause discovered oval or globular end-bodies, which consisted of a soft, homogeneous substance invested by a nucleated capsule of connective tissue. A nerve fibre pierces the capsrde and terminates in the interior of the end-body, which forms a bulbous enlarge- ment at the end of the nerve, and is called the end-bulb. After the nerve has entered the end-bulb, it may consist only of the axial cylinder and terminate in a pointed extremity, or it may twist upon itself and form a coil within the end-bulb. When the structure of the skin is described, it will be seen that the ending of the nerves in the cutaneous papillas bears a general resemblance to their termination in the end-bulbs of a mucous membrane. In certain of the mucous membranes delicate nerves have been traced into the layer of epithelium, situated on the free surface of the membrane. Petermoller described nerve fibres continuous with the nerves of the cornea pass- ing into the layer of conjunctival epithelium on the front of the cornea. Klein recognised an intra-epitheHal nervous network in the same locality. Chrschtschonovitsch traced non - medullated nerve fibres proceeding from a sub- epithelial network into the deeper epithelial layers of the vaginal mucous membrane, and similar nerve fibres have

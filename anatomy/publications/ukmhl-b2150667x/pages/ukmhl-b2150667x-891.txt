PLACENTA. of the crypts in the placenta of the pig, fox, bitch, steep, and other mammals. The bands of decidua principaUy consist of large, dis- tinctly nucleated, rounded or polygonal cells, lying xn a delicately fibriUated connective tissue. The more slender offshoots contain, at their origin, similar cells, but to a large extent are made up of delicate fibriUated connective tissue containing scattered corpuscles. Altbougb this tissue is often in close apposition to the vUli, it may be separated from it by appreciable intervals, and, from its extreme delicacy, bas the appearance as if it were being so attenu- ated by the growth and expansion of tbe placenta, that it is undergoing atrophy. The maternal blood-vessels, tbe capillaries of which, as already stated, have dilated mto sinuses, are also prolonged into the placenta, along with the ceUular structures of the decidua serotina, so that tbe dilated vessels of the modified uterine mucous membrane are brought into relation with the vascular villi of the foetal chorion. In the placenta, at and near the full time, the growth and expansion of the organ have made so great an ad- vance, that the original relations of its foetal and maternal constituents have become greatly modified, so that some observers have questioned, though erroneously, if maternal structures enter at all into its internal construction. The Mature Placenta presents the appearance of a disc- shaped spongy cake, from 7 to 9 inches in diameter, and about 1 inch thick about its centre, where the umbilical cord is continuous with its chorionic surface; towards its circumference it is always somewhat thinner. Its inner or chorionic surface shows the ramifications of the umbilical

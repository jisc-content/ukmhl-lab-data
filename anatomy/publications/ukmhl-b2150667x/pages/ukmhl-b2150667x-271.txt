THE BEAIN—CEKEBELLUM. 255 the cerebellum into its tentorial and occipital surfaces. The tentorial surface is subdivided by fissures into two smaller lobes, named superior anterior and superior pos- terior. The occipital surface is also subdivided. In each hemisphere may be seen from behind forwards the posterior Fio. 81.—Occipital surface of Cerebellum, a, vallecula; 6, pyramid; c, uvula! d, nodule; e, e, margin of tentorial surface; f,f, great horizontal fissure i fir, posterior inferior lobes; hji, slender lobes; *, i, biventral lobes; I, tonsil; m, flocculus; n, posterior medullary velum; o, cut surface from which the left tonsil has been detached. inferior lobe, the slmder lobe, the hiventral lobe, and the flocculus, which last named is situated immediately behind the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. Immediately internal to the biventral lobe is the amygdala or tonsil, which forms the lateral boundary of the anterior part of the valle- cula. The inferior vermiform process is subdivided into a posterior part or pyramid ; an elevation or uvula, situated between the two tonsils ; and an anterior pointed process or nodule. Stretching between the two flocculi, and attached midway to the sides of the nodule, is a thin, white, semilunar-shaped plate of nervous matter, called the

30G ANATOMY. runs forwards tlirougli tlie parotid gland to tlie face, wliere it divides into (e) temporo-facial and (/) cervico-facud branches to supply the facial muscles of expression, i.e., the muscles of the scalp and external ear, the orbicular muscles of the eyelids, the muscles which dilate and com- press the nostrils, the muscles which approximate and separate the lips, including the buccinator muscle, and also the platysma myoides. The facial is also the secretory nerve for the salivaiy glands. Through the chorda tym- pani it influences the secretion of the submaxillary and sublingual glands, and through the connection between its small petrosal nerve and the auriculo-temporal in the otic ganglion it influences the parotid gland. The Spinal Accessory is the lowest division of the eighth nerve. It springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata, and from the lateral column of the cervical part of the spinal cord as low as the fifth cervical nerve : its roots arise from the intermedio-lateral group of nerve ceUs in the cord, and from a nucleus of grey matter in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres of origin enter the skull through the foramen magnum, join the fibres from the meduUa, and leave the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen. This nerve, purely motor in function, is sub- divided into two parts, an internal and an external. The external passes obHquely outwards across the side of the neck, pierces the sterno-mastoid, forms a plexus of commu- nication with the third and fourth cervical nerves, and ends in the trapezius, both of which muscles it suppbes. The internal joins the upper ganglion of the pnemnogastric nerve, of which it forms the motor or accessory root, and is distributed along with it.

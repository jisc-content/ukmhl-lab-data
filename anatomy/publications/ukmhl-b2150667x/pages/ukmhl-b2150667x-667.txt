651 THE TONSILS. many of wliicli are continued into the fibrous tissue of tlie periosteum, which covers the alveolar surface of the jaw. The free surface of the corium of the gum possesses nume- rous broad papillae, and is covered by a stratified pave- ment epithelium similar to that in the lips and cheeks. The mucous membrane of the hard palate is also tense and touo-h, thou2;h not so much so as the gum; and the fibrous fasciculi of its corium blend with the connective tissue of the subjacent periosteum. The mucous lining of the mouth is a sensitive membrane, and receives its nervous supply from the fifth cranial nerve. The superior maxillary division of that nerve gives branches to the hard and soft palate, upper gum, and mucous lining of the upper lip: the inferior maxillary division to the raucous lining of the cheek and lower lip, lower gum, and floor of the mouth. Krause has described end bulbs, in connection with the terminal branches of the nerves, in the mucous membrane of the lips, floor of the mouth, and soft palate. The mucous membrane of the mouth is specially modi- fied in some localities by the development of collections of Lymphoid Tissue in the sub-epithelial connective tissue. This is particularly the case in connection with the mucous membrane of the dorsum of the tongue in the interval between the circumvallate papillae and the epiglottis; and in the substance of the tonsil. The Tonsils are two almond-shaped bodies, situated, one on each side of the posterior orifice of the mouth, in the fossa between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. One surface of each tonsil is free, and covered by the epithelium of the mucous membrane; the other is attached to the inner surface of the superior constrictor

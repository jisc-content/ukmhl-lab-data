259 THE BEAINâ€”CEREBELLUM. corptiscles of Purhinje, are situated in the grey cellular layer. The body of each ceil lies close to the junction of the cellular and rust coloured layers with each other, and the slender central process arising from each cell enters the rust coloured layer, and, as the observations of Hadlich and Koschennikoff show, becomes continuous with the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre; for the nerve fibres of the white core enter this layer, divide into minute fibres, and ramify amidst the graniiles. From the oppo- site aspect of each cell two peripheral processes arise, and ramify in an antler-like manner in the external grey layer. Obersteiner and Hadlich maintain that the finer branches of these processes curve back towards the rust coloured layer, where, according to BoU, they form a net- work of extreme minuteness, from which it is believed that nerve fibres may arise. The substratum of the grey layer, in which the branched processes of the cells of Purkinje lie, consists of a very delicate neuroglia, in which scattered corpuscles are imbedded; but, in the outer part of this layer, delicate supporting connective tissue-like fibres are also met with. The blood-vessels of the invest- ing pia mater pass into the cellular layer of grey matter and form in it a rich capillary plexus. Some pass through the cellular into the rust coloured layer, where they also form a rich capillary network, and from them smaller vessels are prolonged into the white core, the vascularity of which is comparatively feeble. The FouHh Ventricle is the dilated upper end of the cen- tral canal of the medulla oblongata. Its shape is IHce an heraldic lozenge. Its floor is formed by the grey matter of the posterior surfaces of the medulla oblongata and pons;

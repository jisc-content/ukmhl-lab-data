208 ANATOMY. within the corpuscle. Capillary blood-vessels are distributed to the concentric layers of the Pacinian corpuscle. The mode of origin of the nervous tissue in the course of development of the embryo is stiU. involved in some obscurity. It has, however, been ascertained that the cells, both of the epiblast and mesoblast, participate in its formation. The nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord, and the nerve fibres also, either altogether or in great part, are derived from the ceEs of the epiblast, whilst the distributory nerves, both cranial and spinal (except the olfactory bulb and peduncle and the optic nerve), the ganglia situated on these nerves, and the ganglia and distributory nerve fibres' of the sympathetic system, are differentiations of the cells of the mesoblast. The embryo cells multiply by division, and possess at first a rounded form. They then assume characteristically granular and finely fibrillated contents, and processes or poles appear at the periphery of the cells, which, according to the observations of Beale, connect adjacent cells together. As the growth of the part goes on, the cells are more widely separated from each other, and the anastomosing processes in consequence become "considerably elongated, and form the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre. In the course of time the medullary sheath and the primitive membrane may form around this axial cylinder so as to insulate it. The exact mode of formation of the medullary sheath is not properly understood; but it is believed that the primi- tive membrane, and the perineurial connective tissue, are derived from those surrounding embryonic cells which differentiate into connective tissue. Of the two originaUy contioTious cells from which the nerve fibre is, as it were.

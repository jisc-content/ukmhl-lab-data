ANATOMY. 220 site the fissures between the convolutions of the cerebrum, the interval between the arachnoid and the pia matter can, however, always be seen, for the arachnoid does not, like the pia mater, clothe the sides of the fissures, but passes directly across between the summits of adjacent convolu- tions. The sub-arachnoid space is divided into numerous freely-communicating loculi by fasciculi of delicate areolar tissue, which bundles are invested, as Key and Retzius have shown, by a layer of fiat eudothelial-like cells. Beneath the layers of fiat cells fibres, resembUng those of elastic tissue, are rolled in an angular or spiral manner around the fasciculi. The space contains a limpid cerebro-spinal fluid, which varies in quantity from 2 drachms to 2 ounces. The fluid is alkaline, of sp. gr. 1-00.5, contains a little albumen, and a substance which, as I pointed out some years ago, reduces blue oxide of copper to the state of yeUow sub-oxide. The arachnoid membrane is made up of delicate connective tissue. The free surface next the sub-dural space is smooth, like a serous membrane, and covered by a layer of squamous endotheUum. This layer is reflected on to the roots of the spinal and cranial nerves, and, when they pierce the dura mater, it becomes con- tinuous with the endothelial lining of that membrane. As the arrangement and structure so closely correspond with what is seen in the serous membranes, many anato- mists regard the arachnoid as the visceral layer of a serous membrane, and the endothelial lining of the dura mater as the parietal layer, whilst the sub-dural space is the inter- mediate cavity. When the skull cap is removed, clusters of granular bodies are usually to be seen imbedded in the dura mater

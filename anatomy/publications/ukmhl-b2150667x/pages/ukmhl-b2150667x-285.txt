269 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBEUM. does not correspond in shape to the outside of the brain. The Central Lobe of the hemisphere, more usually called the insula or island of Reil (Fig. 87, C), does not come to the surface of the hemisphere, but lies deeply within the Sylvian fissure, the convolutions forming the margin of which con- ceal it. It consists of four or five short convolutions, which radiate from the locus perforatus anticus, situated at the inner end of the fissure. This lobe is almost entirely sur- rounded by a deep sulcus, which insulates it from the adja- cent convolutions. It lies opposite the upper part of the alisphenoid, where it articulates with the parietal and squa- mous-temporal. If the convolutions on the outer face of the hemisphere be now examined, not so much with reference to their disposition in the individual lobes as to their general arrangement, and the fissure of Kolando be taken as the starting line, it wiU' be seen that a well-defined convolu- tion extends in the vertical transverse direction immediately in front of, and a second immediately behind, that fissure, from the margin of the longitudinal fissure downwards and outwards to that of Sylvius. These., are the ascending frontal and parietal gyri. From the anterior of these gyri the convolutions extend in the postero-anterior direction to the anterior end of the cerebrum, and form the three tiers (more or less distinct in different individuals) of the frontal gyri. From the posterior of these gyri, also, con- volutions extend in the antero-posterior direction as far as the posterior end of the cerebrum, but their separation into tiers is not so clearly marked as in the anterior group. Stm we may regard the postero-parietal lobule, the first

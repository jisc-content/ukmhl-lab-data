ANATOMY. 174 ates the epiphysis from the shaft of a bone. The ossifica- tion of this plate of cartilage marks the period when growth ceases in the long axis of the bone. But bones also grow in thickness, and this addition to their girth takes place by an ossification of material situated at their circumference. It has already been pointed out that a bone is invested by a fibrous membrane, the periosteum, which fulfils for it the same purpose as does the peri- chondrium for the cartilage. On the deeper surface of the periosteum, i.e., next the bone itself, are osteo-blastic cells, ■similar to those which lie in the medullary spaces of the foetal cartilage. These cells pass through a similar series of changes, and produce successive layers of new bone at the periphery. The importance of the periosteum as a centre of origin of new bone has, indeed, long been recog- nised by both surgeons and pathologists. The parts of this membrane in which the special bone-producing power resides is the deep layer of osteo-blastic cells, whilst the blood-vessels furnish the pabulum for their nutrition. If strips of periosteum be removed, along with the cells of the deeper osteo-blastic layer, from a bone, and transplanted to other parts of the Hving body, bone will continue to be produced by their agency. The intra-membranous ossification of bone was first recognised by Nesbitt, and has been worked out in most of its details by Sharpey, KoUiker, and Gegenbaur. The tabular bones of the skuU offer the best iUustration of this mode of ossification. Sharpey has pointed out that a network of minute spicula of bone forms in the fibrous mem- brane and extends in radiating Unes from the centre of ossi- fication towards the ckcumference of the bone. The ossify-

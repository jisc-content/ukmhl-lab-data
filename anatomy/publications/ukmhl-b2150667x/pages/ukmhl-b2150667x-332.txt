316 ANATOMY. upper thoracic and the lumbar ganglia to the articulations between the adjaeent vertebrae, c, Pulmonary branches from the 3d or 4th thoracic ganglia, which join the posterior pulmonary plexus, d, Vaso-motor branches or nervi molles, which supply the muscular coat of the arteries : those which arise from the cranial prolongation of the superior cervical ganglion supply the internal carotid artery and its branches to the brain and eyeball: those which arise from the superior cervical ganglion itself supply the external carotid artery and its branches; from the branch accompanying the facial artery the submaxilliary ganglion derives its sympathetic root; from that accompanying the middle meningeal artery the otic ganglion derives its sympathetic root : the vaso-motor nerves which arise from the middle cervical ganglion supply the inferior thyroid arteiy, and pass to the thyroid gland: the vaso-motor branches of the inferior cervical ganglion supply the vertebral and basUar arteries and their several branches, which pass to the spinal cord and the hinder part of the encephalon. A'aso-motor nerves also arise from the thoracic ganglia, which pass to the thoracic aorta, from the lumbar gangUa to the abdominal aorta, and from the sacral ganglia to the middle sacral artery; the ganglion impar gives branches to a peculiar vascular struc- ture, named the coccygeal body, developed in connection with the end of the middle sacral artery; a body of similar structure, caUed intercarotic hody, situated in the angle of bifurcation of the common carotid artery, receives branches from the superior cervical ganglion, e, Cardiac branches fromthe superior, middle, and inferior cervical and the 1st thoracic ganglia, which pass into the thorax to join the pre- vertebral cardiac plexus. /, ^p^cmcAmcbranches as follows:

Some of these vilH are com- paratively short, but the greater number are so long that their terminal branches reach, and are often attached to, the iDlacental surface of the decidua serotina. The outer, attached or uterine surface of the placenta, is formed by the placental decidua, decidua serotina, or modified uterine mucosa of the placental area. The pla- cental decidua is continuous at the margin of the placenta with the decidua vera, and it usually turns over the border of the placenta on its chorionic surface, and forms a more or less strongly marked band extending around its circumference. When separated from the uterus the outer surface is seen to be covered by a layer of the decidua sero- tina, which presents a flocculent appearance where it has been torn awa,y from the uterine wall. It is marked by furrows, and bands of the decidua pass into the substance of the placenta at these furrows, and extend through its substance up to the chorion, so as to divide it into lobes or cotyledons. As these inter-lobular dissepiments are often imperfect, the lobes are not completely shut oflF from each other. Slender processes of the decidua serotina proceed both from the surface of the dissepiments, and from the placental surface of the serotina generally, into the interior of the lobes, but they can only be traced for a short dis- tance, as they do not form a continuous framework of maternal tissue, such as exists in the placenta at the fifth month. Delicate threads of decidua may, however, occa- sionally be seen passing between the villi, and connecting them not only with each other, but with the decidual dis-

THE EYEBALL. granules are nucleated enlargements of these fibres. These fibres possess varicosities Hke those of the internal granule layer. The hacillary layer (9) or membrane of Jacob consists of multitudes of elongated bodies arranged side by side like rows of palisades, and vertically to the surfaces of the retina. Some of these bodies are cylindrical, and are named the rods of the retina; others are flask-shaped, and named the cones of the retina: the rods equal in length the entire thickness of the bacUlary layer; the cones are shorter than the rods, and are interspersed at regular intervals between them ; the apex of each cone is directed towards, but does not reach, the plane of the posterior or choroidal surface of the retina. The posterior or outer end of each rod rests against the pigmentary layer of the choroid. The anterior or inner ends of both rods and cones are con- tinuous with the rod and cone fibres of the external granule layer, as already described. Each rod and cone is subv divided into an outer strongly refractile and an inner feebly refractile segment. By the action of various reagents th^ outer segments both of the rods and cones exhibit a trans- verse striation, and ultimately break up into discs. Hensen has described a longitudinal striation in the outer segments^ and Ritter has stated that both in the outer and inneu segments of the rods an axial fibre exists. Max Schultzdi has also seen the inner segments of both rods and cones longitudinally striped on the surface. Ewart has traced a varicose fibrilla, which he believes to be nervous, from the external granule layer into the inner segment of a cone (Fig. 102). Modifications in the relative numbers and appear- ances of the rods and cones have been seen in the eyes of

428 ANATOMY. the glandular or secreting function of the alimentary mucous membrane. The Capsular arteries, small in size, arise from the sides of the aorta above the renal arteries, and run outwards, to end in the supra-renal capsules. The Kenal arteries arise from the sides of the aorta, and pass outwards, one to each kidney. They send branches to the supra-renal capsule and ureter. In the substance of the kidney they give off small perforating branches, which pierce the capsule of the kidney, and are distributed in the surrounding fat. The Spermatic arteries are two long slender arteries, which arise from the aorta close to the renal arteries. They descend one on each side, behind the peritoneum, to the internal or deep abdominal ring, where each comes into re- lation with the vas deferens, and assists in forming the sper- matic cord,which passes into the scrotum to the testicle. The corresponding arteries in the female, called the Ovarian, do not leave the abdomen ; they supply the ovaries. SECOND GROUP.â€”PARIETAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. The branches of the aorta which supply the walls of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, are the intercostal, the lumbar, the phrenic, and the middle sacral arteries. The Intercostal arteries arise from the back of the thoracic aorta, and are usually ten pairs. They run along the sides of the vertebral bodies as far as the commence- ment of the intercostal spaces, when each divides into a dorsal and a proper intercostal branch; the dorsal branch passes to the back of the thorax to supply the deep muscles.

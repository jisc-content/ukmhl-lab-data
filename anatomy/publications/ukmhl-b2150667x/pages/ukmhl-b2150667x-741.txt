LIVER. 725 tendon, and with a portion of tlie left half of the muscle, also with the anterior abdominal wall in the upper part of the epigastrium. It is attached to the diaphragm and epigastric wall of the abdomen by a fold of the peritoneum, caUed the falciform or suspensory ligament, which extends along the upper surface from the anterior to the posterior bordtr of the liver, and marks the division into a large right and a small left lobe. From the close relation of this surface of the liver to the diaphragm it follows the movements of that muscle, being depressed during inspira- tion, elevated during expiration. The highest part of the surface of the liver lies at the end of an expiration opposite the 4th right intercostal space, a little to the inner side of the right nipple, from which spot it rapidly slopes down- wards to the right about as low as the 11th right rib, whilst it inclines much more gradually to the left almost on a line with the junction of the ensiform cartilage with the meso-sternum. The 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs, separated by the diaphragm, arch superficially to its right lobe, whilst the left lobe is arched over by the car- tilages of the 6th, 7th, and 8th ribs. The summit of the right lobe is in relation, the diaphragm intervening, with the base of the right lung; that of the left lobe with the heart, pericardium, and a portion of the base of the left lung. The upper surface of the liver is sometimes marked by furrows extending in the antero-posterior direction, which, when the organ is in situ, are occupied by folds of the diaphragm. These depressions have usually been ascribed to tight lacing, the pressure of the stays being supposed to have forced the ribs and diaphragm into the liver. But as I have seen these furrows almost as fre-

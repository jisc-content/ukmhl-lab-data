550 ANATOMY. Each lymphatic gland is surrounded by a capsule, which consists of interlacing bundles of connective tissue intermingled with" non-striped muscular- fibres, which in some animals, as the ox, are very numerous. When a section is made through a gland it is seen to consist of an external, yellowish-red, rtical part, and of a central, more deeply red, medullary part, which, however, reaches the surface at the hilus.

These alveob' contain rounded nodules, consisting of the proper glandular or follicular tissue of the lymphatic gland which is arranged therefore as a number of follicles, called the follicles of the cortex. As the trabecule do not form perfect partitions between adjacent folUcles, the tissue of one f oUicle is to some extent continuous with that of those which lie around it. These follicles are formed of lymphoid tissue, resembling in structure the lymphoid follicles already

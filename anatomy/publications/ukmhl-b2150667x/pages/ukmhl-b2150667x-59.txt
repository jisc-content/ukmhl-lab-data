APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 43 the front, and with its axis in line with the axis of the fore-arm. The Carpal or Wrist bones (Fig. 9) are eight in number and small in size: they are arranged in two rows, a 'proximal,—i.e. a row next the fore-arm,—consisting of the scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform; and a distal, —i.e., a row next the bones of the palm,—consisting of a trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform; the bones in each row being named in the order they are met with, from the radial or outer to the ulnar or inner side of the wrist. It is unnecessary to give a separate description of each bone. Except the pisiform or pea-shaped bone, which articulates with the front of the cuneiform, each carpal bone is short and irregularly cuboidal in shape; its anterior (or palmar) surface and its posterior (or dorsal) being rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its superior and inferior surfaces being invariably smooth, for articulation with adjacent bones; whilst the inner and outer surfaces are also smooth, for articulation, except the outer surfaces of the scaphoid and trapezium (the two external bones of the carpus), and the inner surfaces of the cuneiform and unciform (the two internal bones). Occasionally a ninth or supernumerary bone may arise from the' subdivision of the scaphoid, semilunar, or trapezoid, into two pieces; more rarely a distinct bone is found in the human wrist inter- calated between the trapezoid, os magnum, semilunar, and scaphoid, which corresponds in position to the os inter- medium, found constantly in the wrist of the orang, gibbon, the taUed apes, and many rodents and insectivora. The Metacarpal bones, or bones of the Palm of the Hand, are five in number (Fig. 9). They are miniature long

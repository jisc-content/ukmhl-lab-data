258 ANATOMY, The grey matter of the cortex is divided into two well- defined layers, an external grey or cellular layer, and an inner rust coloured layer of about equal thickness. The rust coloured layer is distinguished by containing multi- tudes of so called "granules," the well-defined nucleus in which, as described by Strachan, is invested by a small Fig. 82.-Vertical section through a folii™ «f'he Cerebellum 0 outer^^^^^^^^^ grey matter, in which are the corpuscles of Purkmje ; I, layer: F, fibres of the white core; V, V, vessels ui the pia ma er.

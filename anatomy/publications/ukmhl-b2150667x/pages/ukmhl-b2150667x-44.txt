ANATOMY. 28 Tlie Parietal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7), form the greater part of the side wall of the skull, and mount upwards to the vertex, where they unite together along the line of the sagittal suture. Each bone possesses about the centre of its outer surface an eminence, the centre of ossification of the bone, with which a hollow on the cerebral surface, lodging a convolution of the parietal lobe of the brain, corresponds. The bone is quadrilateral in form. Three of its margins are strongly denticulated, for junction with the occipital, frontal, and corresponding parietal; the fourth is scale-hke, for union with the tem- poral, and forms the squamous suture; near the upper margin on the cerebral surface is a groove for the lodgment of the superior longitudinal venous sinus. The anterior inferior angle articulates with the ali-sphenoid, and is marked by a groove for the middle meningeal artery; the posterior inferior is grooved for the lateral venous sinus, and articulates with the mastoid of the temporal. The Temporal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7), are placed at the side and base of the skull, and are remarkable for containing in their interior the organs of hearing. Each bone consists originally of four sub- divisions—a squamoso-zygomatic, a tympanic, a petro- mastoid, and a styloid—^which in course of time fuse together to form an irregular-shaped bone. The squamous part of the squamoso-zygomatic is a thin plate which forms that part of the side of the skull familiarly known as the "temple." The zygoma extends horizontally forwards ?:as a distinct arched process, to join the malar or cheek-bone. At the root of the zygoma is a smooth fossa, called glenoid, which receives the condyle of the lower jaw, and assists in

ANATOMY. 470 Zd. To palate and face : facial artery. 4:fh. To scalp and auricle : occipital, posterior auricular and temporal arteries. 5th. To pharynx, palate, deep parts of face, teeth, nose, and membranes of brain: ascending pharyngeal and internal maxillary arteries. Important anastomoses take place not only between the branches of the carotid arteries, but also between them and those of the subclavian. The principal anastomoses may be arranged as follows :â€” 1st. Between the external and internal carotids of the same side : a, temporal with supra-orbital and frontal; b, angular termination of facial with nasal branch of oph- thalmic. 2d. Between branches of external carotid of the same side: a, temporal with posterior auricular and occipital; b, facial with transverse facial and with buccal, infra- orbital and mental branches of internal maxillary j c, ascending palatine of facial with ascending pharyngeal, and with descending palatine of internal maxUlary. M. Between branches of external carotids of opposite sides: a, facial with facial; b, temporal with temporal; c, occipital with occipital; d, superior thyroid with supe- rior thyroid. Uh. Between branches of internal carotids of opposite sides : anterior cerebral with anterior cerebral, through the anterior communicating. 5th. Between the subclavian and external carotid of the same side : a, deep cervical with princeps cervicis of occi- pital ; b, vertebral with occipital; c, inferior thyroid with superior thyroid.

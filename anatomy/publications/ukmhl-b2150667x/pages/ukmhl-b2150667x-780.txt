ANATOMY. 764 layer of the enamel organ are columns set perpendicularly to tlie surface of the dental papilla. They undergo a greater elongation, and form six-sided prismatic cells, which KoUiker has named the internal or ^enamel ejntlidium. The cells of the most superficial layer of the enamel organ lie in contact with the vascular connective tissue, which Fig. 213.â€”Vertical sectien throtigli gum of Sheep in tlie region of the molar teeth. p the papilla of a milk (molar; 1, the inner, 2, the miridle, and 3, the outer layers of the enamel organ; n. the neck of the enamel organ; e\ the superfcial epithelium; ct, ct, ct, the suh-epithelial connective tissue which subsequently foi-ms the sac of the tooth; the cavity of resere occupied l)y epithelium, in connection with which the pennanent successional tooth is foi-med.

They form the external epi- thelium of the enamel organ, and slender papillary prolon- gations of the connective tissue frequently project into this epithelial layer. The cells of the enamel organ, situated between its external and its internal epithelium, become

152 ANATOMY. more readily seen than in an adult tendon, in whicli the increased production of fibres obscures the cellular element. The mode of origin of the yellow elastic fibres has also been much discussed. At one time it was believed that they were derived from nuclei, and on this supposition they were named nuclear fibres. But from more recent observa- tions there is reason to believe that they are produced, like the white fibres, by a special differentiation of the proto- plasm of the embryonic cells, or of a homogeneous matrix derived from that protoplasm. In such localities as the ligameutum nuchse, where the fibres are both large and nimierous, the whole of the cell protoplasm appears to become converted into elastic tissue. In tendons, and those parts where these fibres are slender and scanty, and coil round the bundles of white fibrous tissue, they apparently arise from a differentiation of the protoplasm on the sur- face only of the foripative embryonic cells. â€¢ ^ Adipose Tissue. The Adipose or Fatty tissue varies in its amount in different individuals. It is especiaUy found in the mar- row of the bones; as a layer beneath the skin, differing in thickness in different individuals; and collected in the cavity of the abdomen in the folds of peritoneum, known as the mesentery and omenta, in which, and indeed in the other localities where it occurs, it is intimately asso- ciated with the connective tissue. It consists of cells, which vary in size from ^^^th to ^h^h inch, usuaUy ovoid or spherical in form, though when coUected mto

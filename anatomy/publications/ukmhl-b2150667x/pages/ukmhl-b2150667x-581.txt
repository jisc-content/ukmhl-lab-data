565 THYMUS GLAND. THYMUS GLAND. The Thymus Gland is found in all animals which breathe by lungs, though it has no physiological con- nection with them. It is a fawn-coloured, lobulated body, situated in the upper part of the thorax, and in the lower part of the neck of infants and children. It lies for the most part in the anterior mediastinum, but is pro- longed upwards into the neck in close relation to the trachea as far as the lateral lobes of the thyroid body. Its thoracic part is immediately behind the sternum, and in front of the pericardium, the left innominate vein, the aortic arch, and its three large branches. The thymus consists of two lateral lobes, somewhat triangular in form, but of unequal size. The broader part of each lobe lies in the thorax, and the narrower end forms the cervical prolongation. The two lobes are closely attached to each other by intermediate connective tissue, so that at first sight they seem to constitute a single organ. The gland reaches its maximum size about the end of the second year; after which it remains stationary for some years. About the eighth year it begins to undergo fatty degenera- tion, and at the time of puberty it forms two elongated lobes of fatty tissue, situated in the anterior mediastinum, in which condition it is found during the rest of life. In rare cases the thymus may retain its proper structure until after puberty; I have seen it in the adult harte- beest and nylghau preserving its normal structure. Structure.â€”Each lobe of the thymus gland is invested by a capsule of connective tissue, which is prolonged into the substance of the lobe and divides it into lobules.

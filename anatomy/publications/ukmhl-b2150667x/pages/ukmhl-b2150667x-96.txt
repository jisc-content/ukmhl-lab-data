80 ANATOMY. circumference from the xiphi-sternum, cartilages of six lower ribs, arcuate ligaments, and by its two crura from the bodies of the four upper lumbar vertebrae, forms the floor of the thoracic and the roof of the abdominal cavity. It con- stitutes a great arch, with its convexity directed to the cavity of the chest. By the contraction of its fibres, which are inserted into a trefoil-shaped central tendon, the arch is rendered less convex, and the floor of the chest is thereby depressed. Under circumstances which require more powerful efforts of inspiration, the muscles which pass from the walls of the chest to the upper hmbs may, by taking their fixed points at the limbs,'act as elevators of the ribs. During expiration the ribs are depressed, their lower borders inverted, the width of the intercostal spaces diminished, the sternum depressed, the spine more curved, and the diaphragm more convex. These move- ments are principally due to the recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs previously rendered tense by the inflation of the air-cells, and to the untwisting of the ribs when the inspiratory muscles cease to elevate and rotate them. Muscular action plays but a small part in quiet expiration, but the expulsion of the air from the lungs may be facili- tated by contracting the abdominal muscles, which, by pressing the abdominal viscera against the under surface of the diaphragm, force that muscle upwards. The Temporo-maxillary Joints are the only diarthrodial articulations in the head. The condyle of the lower jaw on each side is received into the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone; each joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament, and between the articular surfaces is a meniscus, which sub- divides the interior of the joint into two cavities, each lined

230 ANATOMY. to the brain, and the motor impulses from the brain downwards to the muscles. But further, the cord is the great, nerve centre concerned in reflex excito-motory actions. It must, also, be remembered that the two halves of the cord are anatomically continuous with each other through the nerve fibres of the commissures, so that it acts as a single organ, and not as two organs. Experiments have shown that sensory impulses are conducted upwards through the cord, not by that half from which the nerves arise that have been excited, but by the opposite half of the cord, which is obviously due to the crossing of the fibres of the posterior commissure. Motor impressions are, however, conducted downwards by that half of the cord from which the nerves arise that pass to supply the muscles to be moved. The spinal cord is weU suppHed with blood by numerous arteries, which ramify not only in the pia mater investing its periphery, but in the processes which dip into the median fissures, more especially the anterior. SmaU arteries enter the longitudinal columns perpendicular to their free surfaces, ramify in the connective tissue frame- work, and end in a capillary plexus for the supply of the nerve fibres. Other vessels, somewhat larger in size, pass through the columns into the grey matter, where they also are connected with a capillary plexus. The capillaries are much more numerous in the grey matter of the cord than in the wHte columns. In transverse sections through the cord a pair of smaU vessels may often be seen imbedded in the neuroglia of the posterior commissure; these vessels lie paraUel to and at the sides of the central canal (Fig. 74).

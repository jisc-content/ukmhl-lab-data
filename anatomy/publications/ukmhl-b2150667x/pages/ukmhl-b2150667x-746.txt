ANATOMY. 730 kidney and supra-renal capsule. As the liver is a solid organ, the sound which is elicited by percussing the wall of the abdomen superficial to it is a dull sound. But as the liver has three resonant structures in relation to it, viz., the lung above, and the hepatic flexure of the colon and the stomach below, the dull sound is necessarily modi- fied in the regions occupied by those organs. As the heart is in relation to a portion of the upper surface of the liver, the line of demarcation in that locality between the two organs is with difficulty discriminated by percussion. Structure of the Liver. The liver is a solid organ, of a brownish-red colour. It is composed of the raoaifications of the portal vein, of the portal capillaries, the hepatic vein, the hepatic artery, the hepatic duct, of secreting cells, nerves, and lymphatics. These several structures are bound together by connective tissue, and the organ is invested by the peritoneum. The liver possesses two coats, a serous and a fibrous. The serous or external coat is a part of the peritoneal membrane, and forms an almost complete investment for the liver. Where the gall bladder and inferior cava lie in contact with the under surface it is prolonged over those bodies; it is reflected from the transverse fissure as the gastro-hepatic omentum, and from the upper surface and the posterior border as the falciform, coronary, and right and left lateral ligaments. The fibrous coat, or tunica propria, is immediately sub- jacent to the serous coat, and is so closely adherent to it as

The ribs are all jointed behind by their heads to the bodies of the vertebrae, and they all, except the eleventh and twelfth, possess tubercles, which are jointed to the trans- verse processes of their corresponding dorsal vertebrae. The intervals between the ribs, or intercostal spaces, are occu- pied by the external and internal intercostal muscles, and by an anterior and a posterior intercostal fibrous membrane. The intercostal spaces are eleven in number on each side of the thoracic wall. Each space is not of equal width in its entire length, for the borders of the ribs which bound it are not parallel with each other. They are the widest opposite the junction of the osseous and cartilaginous part of the costal arch, but from this spot they diminish in width from before backwards. The width of the upper series of spaces is greater than that of the middle and lower. The lower two intercostal spaces, however, remain of equal width throughout. The External or Superficial Intercostal muscle forms a layer extending, from the tubercles of the ribs posteriorly, as far as, or almost as far as, the junction of the osseous and cartilaginous part of the rib anteriorly. Its fasciculi are short; they arise from the lower border of one rib, and pass obliquely downwards and forwards to be inserted into the upper border of the rib situated immediately below. The Internal or Deep Intercostal muscle forms a layer extending from the anterior ends of the costal cartilages as far back as the angles of the ribs. Its fasciculi arise from the inner margins of the lower border of the rib and

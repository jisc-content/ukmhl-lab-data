TRACHEA. 617 They proceed from the bifurcation of the trachea, and pass obliquely downwards and outwards to the roots of their respective lungs. The left bronchus is longer and more oblique than the right, and enters the back of the root of the left lung, below the pulmonary artery, but above the pulmonary vein. The right bronchus, though shorter, is wider than the left, and enters the back of the root of the right lung above the pulmonary artery. The vena azygos arches forwards immediately above the right bronchus to join the superior cava; whilst the left bronchus lies within the arch of the aorta. In the angle formed by the bifur- cation of the bronchi is a cluster of lymphatic glands. The bronchi correspond to the interscapular region on the posterior surface of the thoracic wall, on a level with the fifth, and sixth dorsal vertebras. Structure of the Trachea. The wall of the trachea .is formed of cartilage, fibre- elastic membrafue, muscular tissue, a submucous coat, and a mucous membrane. The cartilage is arranged in the form of imperfect rings, from sixteen to twenty in num- ber, separated by narrow intervals. Each ring is about two- thirds of a circle, and is placed at the front and sides of the trachea, but is absent posteriorly (fig. 161). Some- times a cartilage divides into two branches, at other times two adjacent cartilages fuse together at their posterior ends. The lowest tracheal cartilage has a process prolonged back- wards, at the angle of bifurcation into the two bronchi. Tih.e Jihro-elastic membrane connects together the upper and lower borders of adjacent cartilages, also the upper 2 E

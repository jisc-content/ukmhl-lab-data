ANATOMY. 188 tlie heart, the cells of the embryo heart branch and anasto- mose, and the nuclei multiply. By the transverse striation of the protoplasm of these cells the branched muscular fibres of the heart are produced. In the growth of a muscle the individual fibres increase in size, so that they are bigger in the adult than at the time of birth. The observations of Budge, Weismann, and Beale show that new fibres may also form in a muscle. Weismann believes that this increase may be due to a longitudinal splitting of a pre-existing fibre; but Beale maintains that the new fibres are produced in the muscle in the same manner as the original fibres of the part. The Nervous Tissue and the tissues which form the Blood and Lymph Vessels will be described in the chapters on the Nervous and Vascular systems.

290 ANATOMY. fibres of this system conduct motor impulses downwards to be propagated along the motor cranial and spinal nerves. The peduncular fibres of the crura cerebri are arranged in two groups, named respectively cnista and tegmentum, wMcli are separated from eacb other by the nerve cells of the locus niger. The crusta forms the superficial or anterior part of the crus. Its fibres are in greater part continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the pons derived from the anterior pyramids of the meduUa; but it receives additional fibres from the grey matter of the locus niger, and from the cells of the Sylvian layer in the corpora quadrigemina. Some of the fibres of the crusta pass directly upwards as radiating fibres to the grey cortex of the occipital and temporal lobes, but the larger number terminate in the nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis of the corpus striatum. From these nuclei a great mass of fibres radiates into the cortex of the fronto-parietal lobes, more especially the frontal, but a few also, bearing the special name of stria cornea, pass to the grey matter of the apex of the temporal lobe; fibres also enter the convolutions of the insula. In addition to the radiating fibres, the grey matter of the corpus striatum gives origin to fibres of the middle root of the olfactory peduncle, and to connecting fibres with the grey matter of the septum lucidum. The tegmentum forms the posterior or deeper part of the crus cerebri. Its fibres are continuous with the longi- tudinal fibres of the pons derived from the oUvary fascicuH, fascicuU teretes, and posterior pyramids of the meduUa. k few of the fibres of the tegmentum enter the corpora quadrigemina and corpora geniculata, but the great ma-

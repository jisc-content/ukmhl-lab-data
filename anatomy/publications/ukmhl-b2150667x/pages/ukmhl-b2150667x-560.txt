ANATOMY. 5i4 Two sets of capillary vessels occur in tlie tissues and organs, tlie blood capillaries and the lympli capillaries. The network of lymph capillaries is not continuous with or even in contact with the network of blood capillaries, but the lymph capillaries lie in the meshes of the blood capillary network, and are separated from them by inter- vening tissue elements. The blood which flows into the blood capillaries from the arterial system is for the most part conveyed directly onwards into the veins; but from the pressure to which the blood is subjected, in part Fig. 146. -Diagram of the relation of Yi(Jed bv means of the tlie Blood and Lymph Capillaries â€¢' there is only one channel, viz., the arterial, for conveying pabulum to the tissues of an organ, there are two channels, viz., the venous and lymphatic, for conveying its liquor sanguinis, with perhaps some white cor- puscles, transudes through the delicate coats of the capillaries into the tissues. That which is required for the nutrition of the tissue is applied to that purpose. That which is not needed would accumulate in the tissues, were it not that a drainage system is pro- amidst tlie tissues.

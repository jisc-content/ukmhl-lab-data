ANATOMY. 164 ^â– oth to T^^V^*^ They not unfrequeutly are dilated at the inner end, where they open into the spaces of the cancellated tissue. The compact tissue of all bones possesses a system of canals similar to those found in the long bones, but when bone occurs in the form of very thin plates the canals may be absent. In addition to the Haversian canals, irregular spaces, named Haversian spaces by Tomes and De Morgan, may also be seen in sections through the com- pact tissue. They are met with not only in young but in adult bones, and are regarded as produced by absorption of the bone in those particular localities. In thin sections through bone, more especially when the Haversian canals are transversely divided, the dense tissue or matrix of the bone which surrounds the canals is seen to be arranged in concentric rings, as if it were built up of a series of lamellce superimposed on each other. These lameUse do not at all times form complete circles, and the number which sur- round a canal may vary from two or three to half a dozen; they are sometimes called the Haversian lamellaa. Other lamellte lie in relation to the periosteal surface of the bone, and are called peripheral lamellae ; whilst others again are, as it were, intercalated between adjacent Haversian systems of lamellae, and are named intermediate or interstitial. It has been pointed out by Sharpey that a bone lamella, after the earthy matter has been dissolved out by the action of an acid, is made up of multitudes of fine trans- parent fibres, which intersect each other and form a net- work. But he has further shown that the lameUae are perforated by fibres, or bundles of fibres, which pass through them either perpendicularly or obliquely, so as to bolt adjacent lameUee together. With a little care, the per-

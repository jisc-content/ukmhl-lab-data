510 ANATOMY. corresponding to the cranial branches of the external carotid artery, to flow into the internal jugular vein. b. The Lingual vein conveys the blood from the tongue into the internal jugular vein. c. The Pharyngeal vein corresponds to the ascending pharyngeal artery, and joins the internal jugular. d. The Occi2ntal vein sometimes joins the internal, at others the external jugular vein. e. The Superior Thyroid vein proceeds from the thyroid body, and is joined by the superior laryngeal vein before it enters the internal jugular. /. A Middle Thyroid vein is sometimes seen passing from the thyroid body to the internal jugular vein. The Cranial Venous Blood Sinuses are veins situated between two layers of the dura mater lining the interior of the cranial cavity. Their general arrangement has been described in the section on the membranes of the brain, p. 217. It may, however, be further stated that these sinuses are situated, some in the mesial plane of the cavity, as the superior longitudinal sinus, inferior longitudinal sinus, straight sinus and occipital sinus : others laterally to that mesial plane, as the cavernous sinus, the superior and inferior 2yetrosal sinuses and the lateral sinus : others across the mesial plane, as the circular sinus, which courses around the pituitary body, and opens on each side into the cavernous sinus lying at the side of the body of the sphenoid bone; and the transverse sinus which passes across the upper surface of the basi-occipital and connects the two inferior petrosal sinuses (figs. 138,139). The cranial blood sinuses receive blood from the brain, orbit, and veins of the diploe of the cranial bones, also small veins from the

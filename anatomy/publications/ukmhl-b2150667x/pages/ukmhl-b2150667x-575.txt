THB SPLEEN. 559 into direct relation with the cells and reticulum of the spleen pulp. By other observers again, as Billroth and Kolliker, it is held that the continuity of the vascular wall from the splenic artery to the splenic vein is preserved, and that the reticulum and pulp-cells lie outside the wall of the blood-vessels. The following description, though agreeing in its main features with the descriptions of W. Miiller and Frey, is chiefly based on my own observations on the structure of the human spleen and that of the rat. The reticulum of the spleen pulp has been named the i-nr tervascular iietworh: it is situated in the intervals between the trabecles, and consists of a retiform connective tissue, such as makes up the framework of a lymph follicle. The strands of this framework are composed of stellate and nucleated connective tissue cells, the processes of which anastomose with each other, but fusiform cells are inter- mingled with them. The interstices between these stellate cells are occupied by lymphoid and other colourless corpuscles, and by red blood cor- puscles, and intervene between the capillary terminations of the arteries and the commencement of the veins, so that they are channels for the blood to flow through. They constitute a special modifi- cation of the circulatory appara- tus, and are a sort of cavernous rete mirabile, not enclosed within an endothelial wall, and the stellate cells themselves form a supporting frame- FiG. 155.â€”Cells of the pulp of the human Spleen, s, the stellate retifonn cells; ps, colourless coi-puscles of the spleea pulp.

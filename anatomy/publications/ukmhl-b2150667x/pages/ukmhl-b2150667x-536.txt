520 ANATOMY. the two layers of the broad ligament. The several venous plexuses in relation to the pelvic viscera are apt to become enlarged and gorged with blood, especially in old people, and the veins of the lower end of the rectum and around the anus are apt to undergo varicose dilatations, named haemorrhoids or piles. The External Iliac vein is directly continuous witli the femoral vein, ascends in close relation to the exter- nal iliac artery, and joins the internal iliac to form the common iliac vein. It receives immediately above Poupart's ligament the deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac veins. The Femoral vein is formed by the union of the super- ficial and deep veins of the lower Umb, which are arranged as follows:â€”The superficial veins of the dorsum of the foot are separated from the deep veins by the deep fascia. They commence by very fine rootlets arising from the capillaries of the skin. At the sides of the toes they form the digital veins, and on the dorsum of the foot the digital veins form an arch, from the inner side of which a vein, caUedthe long saphenous, s^vises. This passes upwards along the inner side of the leg and thigh, increasing considerably in size in its course, owing to a number of veins joining it from the extensive surface of the skin of the limb. It terminates, at the upper part of the thigh, by passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and joins the femoral vein. From the outer side of the venous arch on the dorsum of the foot arises the external saplmious vein which runs behind the outer ankle and on the back of the leg to the ham, where it pierces the pophteal fascia to join the popliteal vein. The deep veins begin both on

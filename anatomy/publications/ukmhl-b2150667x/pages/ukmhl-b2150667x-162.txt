ANATOMY. 146 each other, and form an anastomosing network. The structure of tendons has been recently examined with great care by Eanvier, Spina, and Thin with reference to the arrangement of their cellular constituents, and in addi- tion to the fusiform and stellate branched ceUs, which had long been recognised, rows of cells situ- ated between and parallel to the fibrous bundles have been described. In young tendons these cells are polygonal, but in adult tendons they are more flattened. Thin states that they form a continuous Fig 39.-Flat cells on surface of tendo AchiUisof layer of flat CeUs m- afiog.

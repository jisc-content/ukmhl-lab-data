546 ANATOMY. LYMPH FOLLICLES. The Lymph Follicles are especially found in connection with the mucous lining of the alimentary canal, and occur in the mucous membrane of the back of the dorsum of the tongue, in the tonsils, the wall of the pharynx, as the solitary glands of the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, and as the Peyer's glands in the small intestine : their characteristic tissue is also infiltrated into the basis sub- stance of the intestinal villi, and into the connective tissue which separates the tubular intestinal glands from each other. But the lymph follicles are not confined to the alimentary mucous membrane. They are situated in the conjunctiva, where they form the trachoma glands, in the mucous membrane lining the Eustachian tubes, in the laryn- geal, tracheal and bronchial mucous membrane, and they have also been seen in the mucous membrane of the urinary bladder and in that of the vagina. They are developed also in large numbers in the spleen, and form its Mal- pighian bodies. They constitute the structure of the thymus gland. Lymph follicles have also been described in rela- tion to the pleura and the great omentum. The presence of lymph-follicles in the respiratory and intestinal mucous membranes is of interest in relation to the frequent forma- tion of tubercle, under certain pathological conditions, in those localities. The characteristic tissue of the lymph follicles has been variously named lymplioid tissue, lympli-follicular tissue, and adenoid tissue. It consists essentially of two struc- tural elements: first, of colourless corpuscles resembling those of the lymph and blood; second, of steUate branch-

345 THE EYEBALL. the neuroglia of the brain and spinal cord. Not only does it lie between the fibres, cells, and so-called gi-anules in the several nervous layers, and form in them a radial arrange- ment of supporting fibres, but it constitutes the two limitary membranes of the retina. The memhrana limitans externa (8) is excessively thin, and appears in vertical sections through the retina as a mere line between the baciUary and external granular layers, continuous on the one hand with the connective tissue which passes for a short distance be- tween the rods and cones, and on the other with the connec- tive tissue framework of the external granule layer (Fig. 101). The memlrana limitans interna (1) covers the anterior surface of the retina, and lies next the vitreous body; its posterior surface blends with the radial arrangement of connective tissue between the optic nerve fibres, but its anterior or hyaloid „ T /-I Fig. 103.—Flat cells nn the surtace, as J. (j. Ewart has recently anterior surface of the , , retina of the sheep. shown, possesses a mosaic appearance, (^>om Ewm-t.) due to the presence of a layer of flat epithelial cells. The yellow spot exhibits some structural diflFerences from the rest of the retina. It owes its colour to the presence of yellow pigment deposited in the more anterior layers of the retina. Except at its central depression, the fovea centralis, it is thicker than the surrounding parts of the retma; but it is much softer, a condition which is due to the almost complete absence of the layer of optic nerve fibres, and a diminution in the amount of the supporting con- nective tissue; the membrana limitans interna is, however, relatively stronger. In the fovea centralis itself the rods of the bacillary layer have entirely disappeared, and are

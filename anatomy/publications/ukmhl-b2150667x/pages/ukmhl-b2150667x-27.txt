11 AXIAL SKELETON^SPINE, ■ffMlst those which retain their mobility are the true vertebrte. In the vertebrata the bones of the spine are arranged in groups, which may be named from their position—vertebra of the neck or cervical; of .the chest, dorsal or thoracic; of the loins, lumbar; of the pelvis, sacral; and of the taH, coccygeal or caudal; and the number of vertebrae in each group may be expressed in a formula. In man the formula is as follows:— C7D12L5S5C0C4 = 33 bones, as seen in the child; but the five sacral vertebrje fuse together into a single bone—^the sacnim—and the four coccygeal into the single coccyx. Hence the sacrum and coccyx of the adult are the false, whilst the lumbar, dorsal, and cervical are the true vertebrte. The vertebrte are irregularly-shaped bones, but as a rule have certain characters in common. Each possesses a body and an arch, which enclose a ring, with certain pro- cesses and notches. The Body, or Centrum, is a short cylinder, which by its upper and lower surfaces is con- nected by means of fibro-cartilage with the bodies of the vertebrae immediately above and below. The collective series of vertebral bodies forms the great column of the spine. The Arch, also called Neural Arch, because it en- closes the spinal marrow or nervous axis, springs from the back of the body, and consists of two symmetrical halves united behind in the middle line. Each half consists of an anterior part or pedicle, and a posterior part or lamina. The Kings collectively form the spinal canal. The Pro- cesses usually spring from the arch. The spinous process projects backwards from the junction of the two laminae, and the collective series of these processes gives to the

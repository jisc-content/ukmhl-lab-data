ANATOMY. The Arytenoid, or pyramidal cartilages, two in number, are placed on the posterior part of the upper border of the cricoid cartilage. Each is a three-sided pyramid, about half an inch in height, and a quarter of an inch in width. The base articulates with the cricoid, and two of its angles are prolonged into well-marked pro- cesses: the external or muscular process is directed back- wards and outwards, and gives attachment to the tendons of insertion of the lateral and posterior crico-arytenoid muscles; the anterior or vocal process is directed forwards, and gives attachment to the true vocal cord. The apex of the cartilage is directed upwards, and articulates with the corniculum laryngis. The posterior surface is concave, and gives attachment to the arytenoid muscle: the inner surface is smooth, and covered by the mucous membrane ; the anterior surface gives attachment to the superior or false vocal cord, and to the thyro-arytenoid muscle. The base of the arytenoid cartilage is connected to the cricoid by a capsular ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, and a baud of fibres extending from the back of the arytenoid to the back of the cricoid has been named the posterior crico-arytenoid ligament. The false vocal cords, or superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, pass from the anterior surface of each arytenoid cartilage to the retreating angle of the thyroid; and the trt^e vocal cords, or inferior thyro-ary tenoid ligaments, pass from the anterior vocal process of the arytenoid to the retreating angle of the thyroid cartilage (fig. 162). The CoENicuLA Laryngis, or Cartilages of Santorini, are two small nodules articulated to the apices of the ary- tenoid cartilages, the connection being effected by a cap-

374 ANATOMY. througb a gap in tlie edge of the osseous lamina into the organ of Corti. In tMs organ the nerves, as Gottstein and Waldeyer have described, are arranged in two groups of fibres ] the inner group become continuous with the deep end of the inner hair cells; the outer group pass across the canal of Corti and end in the outer hair cells (Fig. 111). Hence these cells are the peripheral end-organs of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve, and may be called the auditory cells of the cochlea. The perilymph of the labyrinth is set in vibration by the movements of the tympanic ossicles and the fenestra ovalis; motion is thus communicated to the membranous labyrinth and the endolymph which it contains. The auditory hairs and cells would thus be set in motion, and the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve would be stimulated to con- duct sound-impulses to the brain. The movements of the perilymph in the scala tympani and of the endolymph in the ductus cochlearis would set in vibration the basilar mem- brane, and the auditory cells resting on it, by which the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve would be stimulated â–  to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. It has been custom- ary for physiologists to regard the vestibule as the part of the labyrinth by which sound or mere noise is determined; the cochlea, as the part which determines variations and degrees of sound, as musical notes or harmony; the semi- circular canals, as determining the directions from which sound proceeds. But within the last two years experiments and arguments have been advanced almost simultaneously by Brener, Mach, and Crum Brown, in favour of the view that the semicircular canals act as peripheral end-organs for the sense of rotation, by which sense the axis about which

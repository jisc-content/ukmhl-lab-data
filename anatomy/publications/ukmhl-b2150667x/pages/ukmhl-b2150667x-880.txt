ANATOMY. 864 Baer the serous envelope of the ovum, but which may more appropriately, from its position within the zona, be named the sub-zonaU membrane. When the union of the amniotic folds has taken place, the' sub-zonal membrane becomes completely severed from the proper amnion, and constitutes one of the layers of the secondary or persistent chorion. The sub-zonal membrane consists essentially of a layer of cells, which was originally continuous with the cellular layer lining the inner surface of the proper amnion, and through it with the epiblast cells forming the cuticular covering of the embryo. But it is not unlikely that, along with this cell-layer, a thin prolongation, of the layer of stellate connective tissue corpuscles of the somato- pleure layer of the mesoblast is present. Between the sub-zonal membrane and the proper amnion a space exists, continuous with the general pleuro-peritoneal cavity of the embryo, which is of interest, in connection with the formation of the permanent chorion, as the space into which the allantois grows and expands. Whilst the changes in the epiblast and somato-pleure, which lead to the formation of the amnion and sub-zonal outer layer of the persistent chorion, are taking place, the hypoblast and adjacent splanchno-pleure gradually extend over the undifferentiated part of the yelk, which they enclose in a sac, the yelk-sac, or umbilical vesicle, and at the same time they form along the ventral surface of the embryo- an elongated tube, the alimentary canal. This canal at first freely communicates with the yelk-sac, but as the walls of the alimentary canal thicken and become more closed in, the communication narrows, until at length the omphalo-mesenteric duct forms the only channel

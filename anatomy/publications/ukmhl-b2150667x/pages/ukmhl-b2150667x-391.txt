375 THE EAE. rotation of tlie head takes place, the direction of that rota- tion, and its rate, are determined. In the account of the development of the skeleton, p. 57, it was stated that the external meatus, tympanum, and Eustachian tube are the remains of the first branchial cleft of the embryo, that the tympanic ossicles are formed in the first and second visceral arches, and that the petrous bone is ossified in the cartilaginous basis cranii. The membranous labyrinth arises as an invagination of the epi- blast into the mesoblast, near the upper end of the second branchial cleft, and the invaginated fold then closes in, by the growth of the surrounding mesoblast, to form a shut sac, the primary auditory vesicle. The cavity of this vesicle enlarges, thickening of its walls takes place, and in this manner arise modifications in its form, from the con- dition of a simple closed sac, until the membranous vesti- bule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea are produced. From the epiblast lining of the vesicle, the organ of Corti, and the special apparatus connected with the termination of the auditory nerve in the vestibide and semicircular canals, together with the general epithelial lining of the membranous labyrinth, are derived. The fibro-membranous wall of the labyrinth, and the periotic cartilage which subsequently ossifies into the petrous bone, are produced by a differentiation of the mesoblast surrounding the auditory vesicle. The space fiUed by perilymph, between the membranous and osseous labyrinth, is apparently due to a splitting of this surrounding mesoblast. The auditory nerve is not, like the optic, a prolongation of the brain, but is developed in the mesoblast lying between the brain and the auditory vesicle. In the course of time its central

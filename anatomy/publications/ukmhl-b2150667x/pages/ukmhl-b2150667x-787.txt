TEETH. 771 enamel is of epiblast origin, whilst the dentine, cement, and pulp are derived from the mesoblast. A tooth in its fundamental development, as was long ago pointed out by Goodsir, must be referred to the same class of organs as the hairs and feathers. The enamel of the tooth, like the hair, is produced by a differentiation of the involuted epithelium of the epiblast, whilst the dentine and pulp resemble the papilla of the hair, in proceeding from the mesoblast. The tooth-sac, like the hair follicle, is also of mesoblast origin. Whether the cement, as Eobin and Magitot have described, be developed by means of a special cement organ, in the interior of the tooth-sac, or is formed, as has been stated in this description, by the alveolo-dental periosteum, it is derived from the mesoblast. As to the origin of Nasmyth's membrane, there is a difference of opinion; some regard it as a special cornification of the external cells of the enamel organ, in which case it would be from the epiblast; whilst others consider it to be continuous with, though structurally different from, the cementâ€”homologous, therefore, with the layer of cement, which in the horse, ruminants, and some other mammals, covers the surface of the crowns of the teeth. As to the membrana preformativa, which some writers have described between the enamel organ and the dentine papUla, and others between the enamel and the enamel organ, I have not been able to see it in any of the develop- ing teeth which I have examined: I therefore agree with C. S. Tomes in believing it not to be present. The tissues of a tooth have not all the same importance in the structure of a tooth. The dentine is apparently always present, but the enamel, or the enamel and cement,

ANATOMY. i96 wall of an artery are named vasa vasorum. Lymph-vessels are said to be situated in the outer coat. Nerves, chiefly derived from the sympathetic, are distributed to the mus- cular coat j they form the peripheral distribution of the vaso-motor nerves. The smallest arteries, or arterioles, are of microscopic size. They possess an endothelial lining, a muscular middle coat, and an external adventitia; but the elastic fenestrated coat is absent (fig. 133). The muscular coat is reduced to a single layer of circularly arranged fibre-cells ; but in the frog, as Lister has shown, these fibre-cells are spirally arranged around the wall of the artery. The elasticity of the wall of an artery is one of its most important physical characters, as it permits the artery to become distended under the pressure caused by the pro- pulsion of the blood into the arteries during the ventricular contraction. When the ventricle ceases to contract the dastic wall recoils on the blood, and causes a continuous stream through the capillaries. Pulsation, or the pulse, is produced by the regular periodic modifications in the calibre of an artery. Owing to the muscularity of the arterial wall, the lumen of the tube can be lessened by the contraction of the circular muscular coat, and the amount of blood supplied to a part can be diminished. When cut across the divided end of an artery is open or gapes.

216 ANATOMY. Membranes of Beaen and Spinal Cord. The brain and spinal cord are invested by three mem- branes or meninges, which lie between them and the bones that form the walls of the cranial cavity and spinal canal. The membranes are named dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Dura mater.â€”The most external membrane, named dura from its firmness, consists of a cranial and a spinal division. The cranial part is in contact with the inner table of the cranial bones, and is adherent along the lines of the sutures and to the margins of the foramina, which transmit the nerves, more especially to the foramen mag- num. It forms, therefore, for these bones an internal periosteum, and the meningeal arteries which ramify in it are the nutrient arteries of the inner table. As the growth of bone is more active in infancy and youth than in the adult, the adhesion between the dura mater and the cranial bones is greater in early life than at maturity. From the inner surface of the dura mater strong flattened bands pass into the cranial cavity, and form partitions between certain of the divisions of the brain. A vertical longitudinal mesial band, named, from its sickle shape, falx cerebri, dips between the two hemispheres of the cerebrum. A smaller sickle- shaped vertical mesial band, the falx cerebelli, attached to the internal occipital crest, passes between the two hemi- spheres of the cerebellum. A large band arches forward in the horizontal plane of the cavity, from the transverse groove in the occipital bone to the cUnoid processes of the sphenoid, and is attached laterally to the upper border of the petrous part of each temporal bone. It separates

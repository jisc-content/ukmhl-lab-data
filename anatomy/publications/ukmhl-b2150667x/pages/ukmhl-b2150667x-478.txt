ANATOMY. 462 face of the hemisphere from the anterior end of the frontal lobe as far back as the internal parieto-occipital fissure, also the corpus callosum, and the superior and middle frontal convolutions. The Posterior Communicating artery is a slender branch which runs backwards to anastomose with the posterior cerebral artery. At the base of the brain not only do the two internal carotids anastomose with each other through the anterior commiinicating artery, which passes between their anterior cerebral branches, but the internal carotid on each side anastomoses with the posterior cerebral branch of the basilar, by a posterior communicating artery. In this manner a vascular circle, the circle of Willis, is formed, which pei-mits of freedom of the arterial circulation by the anastomoses between arteries not only on the same side, but on opposite sides of the mesial plane. But further, the branches which pass to the convoluted surface of the hemisphere anastomose to some extent with each other; thus the anterior and middle cerebral anastomose on the frontal lobe, and the anterior and pos- terior cerebral anastomose on the inner face of the hemi- sphere near the posterior end of the corpus callosum. The vertebral and internal carotid arteries, which are the arteries of supply for the brain, are distinguished by lying at some depth from the surface in their course to the organ, by having curves or twists in their course, whereby the force of the flow of blood is retarded, and by the absence of large collateral branches. Further, as the oph- thalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid, the circu-. lation in the eyebaU is in sympathy with that in the brain.

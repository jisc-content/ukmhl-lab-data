ANATOMY. G88 transversely across the abdominal cavity, but, as has been clearly, pointed out by Luschka, is for the most part placed vertically in the left hypochondrium, so that the fundus is the uppermost part of the organ; whilst the pylorus, which curves to the right into the epigastrium, forms its lower extremity. Owing to the vertical direction of the stomach in the left hypochondrium, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8 th, and 9 th ribs, separated of course by the diaphragm, arch in front of it, for a greater or less dis- tance; and its fundus, the diaphragm intervening, is in relation to the base of the left lung, the heart, and peri- cardium. When greatly distended the stomach acquires more extensive relations. It may push the transverse colon to one side, and may reach into the umbilical, left lumbar, or even the left iliac region. Its fundus also may press upwards the left half of the diaphragm, interfere with the descent of that muscle during deep inspiration, and affect the position and action of the heart. In the distended condi- tion the greater curvature of the stomach is thrown forward, so as to lie in relation to the anterior abdominal wall. The stomach is retained in position, partly by its con- nections with the oesophagus and duodenum, partly by the pressure of the surrounding abdominal walls and viscera, and partly by folds of peritoneum which pass from it to the adjacent structures. These folds are as follows:â€” The gastro-phrenic ligament extends from the diaphragm to the stomach in the angle between the oesophagus and the cardiac extremity: the gastro-hepatic, or small omentum, passes from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the lips of the transverse fissure of the liver ; the gastro splenic omentum from the cardiac end of the stomach to the

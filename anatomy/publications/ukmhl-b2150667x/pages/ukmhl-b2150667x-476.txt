ANATOMY, 460 The Ophthalmic branch arises close to the anterior clinoid process, enters the orbLt, along with the optic nerve, through the optic foramen and runs forwards and inwards above the optic nerve to end in branches to the nose and forehead. It gives origin to the following branches: lachrymal, which runs forwards in relation to the outer side of the roof of the orbit, and supplies the lachrymal gland, conjunctiva, and eyelids: arteria centralis retinae, which passes into the optic nerve, enters the eyeball along with it, and supplies the retina : ciliary branches, which accompany the optic nerve and pierce the sclerotic coat to ramify in the choroid coat, ciliary processes, and iris: rmisctdar branches to the muscles : anterior and posteriw ethmoidal branches, which pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and supply the adjacent part of the dura mater: paljyebral branches to the two eye-lids: nasal branch to the root of the nose : supra-orhital branch, which passes through the supra-orbital notch to the skin and muscles of the forehead : and a frontal branch, which is distributed to the forehead, internal to the supra-orbital. The branches of the internal carotid for the supply of the brain are the middle and anterior cerebral and the posterior communicating. The Middle Cerebral artery extends outwards into the â€¢Sylvian fissure, divides into branches in the pia mater, and supplies the island of Eeil, the orbital convolutions, the inferior and ascending frontal convolutions, and the convolutions of the parietal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes : it also gives p&i-forating branches through the locus perfo- ratus anticus to the corpus striatum, and sends a choroid branch to the choroid plexus of the velum interpositun?

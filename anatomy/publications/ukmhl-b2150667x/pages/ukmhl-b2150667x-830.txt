814 ANATOMY. The Prostate Gland. The Prostate Gland is a muscular and glandular body which surrounds the commencement of the urethra (fig. 224). It is shaped like a chestnut, and measures 1^ inch from base to apex, 1J inch in its transverse diameter, and some- thing less than an inch in thickness. It lies behind the symphysis pubis, and in front of the rectum. Its] direc tion is obliquely from above downwards and forwards, and its base, or highest part, is in relation to the neck of the bladder and the common ejaculatory ducts, whilst, from its depending truncated apex, the membranous part of the urethra emerges. Its anterior surface is attached to the pubes by the pubo-prostatic ligaments of the pelvic fascia, and the anterior parts of the lateral true ligaments of the bladder; whilst the most anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle passes to each of its sides, and form the levator prostatce muscle. The prostate is divided into three lobes, a median and two lateral. The lateral lobes make up the chief part of the gland, and are separated behind by a median notch. The middle lobe is of small size, and lies below the pros- tatic part of the urethra and between the prostatic vesicle and the neck of the bladder. Structure.â€”The prostate gland is invested by a fibrous capsule continuous with the pubo-prostatic ligaments. Beneath the capsule is the prostatic venous plexus, which receives the dorsal vein of the penis, and joins the vesical venous plexus. The substance of the organ is composed partly of muscular and partly of glandular tissue. The

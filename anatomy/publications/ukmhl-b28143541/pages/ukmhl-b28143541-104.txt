100 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. aginary. When this reign of protoplasm was at its height and biologists were seeking for even greater simplicity a most astounding discovery was announced. The British exploring ship Challenger had returned from its voyage of dis- covery and collection, and its various treasures were turned over to the diflerent scientists for study. The brilliant Prof. Huxley, who had first formulated the mechanical theory of life, now startled the biological world with the statement that these collections had shown him that at the bottom of the deep sea, in certain parts ot the world, there exists a diffused mass of living undifferentiated protoplasm. So simple and un- differentiated was it that it was not divided into cells and contained no nucleii. It was, in short, exactly the kind of primitive protoplasm which the evolutionist wanted to complete his chain of living structures, and the biologist wanted to serve as a foundation for his mechanical theory of life. If such a diffused mass of undifferentiated protoplasm existed at the bottom of the ^^a, one could hardly doubt that it was developed there by some purely natural forces. The discovery was a startling one, for it seemed that the actual starting point of life had been reached. Huxley named his substance Bathyhias, and this name became in a short time familiar to every ^ho was thinking of the problems of life. But ttie discovery was suspected from the it was too closely in accord with speculation, an it was soon disproved. Its discoverer soon after courageously announced to the world tbat he had been entirely mistaken, and that the Bathy i i

198 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. environment an important agency in machine building. This direct effect of the conditions is apparently so manifest that one school of biologists finds in it the chief cause of the varia- tions which occur, telling us that the conditions surrounding the organism produce changes in it, and that these variations, being handed down to subse(][uent generations, constitute the basis ot the development of the machine. If this factor is entirely excluded, we are driven back upon the natural selection of congenital variations as the only kind of variations which can permanently effect the modification of the machine. CONSCIOUSNESS. It may be well here to refer to one other' factor in the problem, because it has somewliat recently been brought into prominence. This; factor is consciousness on the part of the animal.. Among plants and the lower animals this factor, can have no significance, but consciousness cer-- tainly occurs among the higher animals. Justt when or how it appeared are questions whichi are not answered, and perhaps never will be.-. But consciousness, after it had once made itss appearance, became a controlling factor in thet’ development of the machine. It must not be. understood by this that animals have had any consciousness of the development of then bocy, or that they have made any conscious endeavours; to modify its development. This has not always; been understood. It has been frequently sup> posed that the claim that consciousness has an

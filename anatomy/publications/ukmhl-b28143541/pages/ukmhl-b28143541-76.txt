72 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. one, then the problem of explaining life would be a chemical one, for all vital properties would be reducible to the properties of a chemical com- pound. It would then only be necessary to show how such a compound came into existence and we should have explained life. !N^or would this be a hopeless task. We are well acquainted with forces adequate to the formation of chemical compounds. If the force of chemical affinity is adequate under certain conditions to form some compounds, it is easy to conceive it as a possi- bility under other conditions to produce this chemical living substance. Our search would need then to be for a set of conditions under which our living compound could have been pro- duced by the known forces of chemical affinity. But suppose, on the other hand, that we find this simplest bit of living matter is not a chemical compound, but is in itself a complicated machine. Suppose that, after reducing this vital substance to its simplest type, we find that the substance with which we are dealing not only has complex chemical structure, but that it also possesses a large number of structural parts adapted to each other in such a way as to work together in the form of an intricate mechanism. The whole prob- lem would then be changed. To explain such a machine we could no longer call upon chemical forces. Chemical affinity is adequate to the ex- planation of chemical compounds however com- plicated, but it cannot offer any explanation for the adaptation of parts which make a machine. The problem of the origin of the simplest form of life would then be no longer one of chemical but

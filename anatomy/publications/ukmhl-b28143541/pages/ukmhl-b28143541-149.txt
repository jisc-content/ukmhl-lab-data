THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 145 to the activities of the cell. If the destructive processes were to go on alone the organism might continue to manifest its life activities for a time until it had exhausted the products stored up in Its body for such purposes, but it would die from the lack of more material for destruction. Life IS not complete without both processes. Now, in the life of the cell we may apparently attribute the destructive processes to the cell substance and the constructive processes to the nucleus. In a cell which has been cut into fragments those pieces without a nucleus continue to show the ordinary activities of life for a time, but they do not live very long (Fig 25). The fragment is unable to assimilate its food sufficiently to build up more m^erial. So long as it still retains within itself a sufficiency of already formed tissue for its destruc- tive metabolism, it can continue to move around actively and behave like a complete cell, but eventually it dies from starvation. On the other hand, those fragments which retain a piece of the nucleus, even though they have only a small portion of the cell substance, feed, assimilate, and grow ; in other words, they carry on not only the destructive but also the constructive changes. Plainly, this means that the nucleus controls the constructive processes, although it does not n^ecessarily mean that the cell substance constructive processes. Without the nucleus the cell is able to perform those processes, while it is able to carry on the de- structive processes readily enough. The nucleus controls, though it may not entirely carry on the constructive metabolism. ^ ^ > e

INTRODUCTION. 27 I ceed in answering the questions above outlined. The fact is that this problem of the mechanical explanation of vital phenomena forms the cap- ! stone of the arch, the sides of which are built of i the doctrines of the conservation of energy and : the theory of evolution. To the presentation of i these problems the following pages will be de- voted. The fact that both the doctrine of the ' conservation of energy and that of evolution are practically everywhere accepted indicates that the mechanical nature of vital forces is regarded as proved. But there are still many questions which are not so easily answered. It will be our purpose in the following discussion to ascer- tain just what are these problems in dynamical biology and how far they have been answered. Our object will be then in brief to discover to what extent the conception of the living organism as a machine is borne out by the facts which have been collected in the last quarter century, and to learn where, if anywhere, limits have been found to our possibility of applying the forces of chemistry and physics to an explanation of life. In other words, we shall try to see how far we have been able to understand living phenomena in terms of natural force. OUTLINE OF THE SUBJECT. â€¢ The subject, as thus presented, resolves itself at once into two parts. That the living organism is a machine is everywhere recognised, although some may still doubt as to the completeness of the comparison. In the attempt to explain the

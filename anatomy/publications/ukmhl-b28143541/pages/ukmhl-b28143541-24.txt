20 THE STORY OE LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. to offer to biologists no longer the complicated problems which were associated with animals and plants, but the same problems stripped of all side issues and reduced to their lowest terms. This simplifying of the problems proved to be an extraordinary stimulus to the students who were trying to find some way of understanding life. NEW ASPECTS OF BIOLOGY. These three conceptions seized hold of the scientific world at periods not very distant from each other, and their influence upon the study of living nature was immediate and extraordinary. Living things now came to be looked upon not simply as objects to be catalogued, but as objects which had a history, and a history which was of interest not merely in itself, but as a part of a general plan. They were no longer studied as stationary, but as moving phases of_ nature. Animals were no longer looked upon simply as beings now existing, but as the results^ of the actio^ of past forces and as the foundation of a different series of beings in the future. The pre- sent existing animals and plants came to be re- garded simirly as a step in the long history of the universe. It appeared at once that the study of the present forms of life would offer us a iireaiis of interpreting the past and perhaps predicting the future. , i In a short time the entire attitude which the student assumed toward living phenomena had changed. Biological science assumed new guises

INTRODUCTION. 17 heat. Or, again, the heat set free under the locomotive boiler is converted by machinery into the motion of the locomotive. By still different mechanism it may be converted into electric force. All forms of motion are readily con- vertible into each other, and each form in which energy appears is only a phase of the total energy of nature. A second condition of energy is energy at rest, or potential enei-gy. A stone on the roof of a house is at rest, but by virtue of its position it has a certain amount of potential energy, since, if dislodged, it will fall to the ground, and thus de- velop energy of motion. Moreover, it required to raise the stone to the roof the expenditure of an amount of.energy exactly equal to that which will reappear if the stone is allowed to fall to the ground. So in a chemical molecule, like fat, there is a store of potential energy which may be made active by simply breaking the molecule to pieces and setting it free. This occurs when the fat burns and the energy is liberated as heat. But it required at some time the expenditure of an equal amount of energy to make the molecule. When the molecule ol fat was built in the plant which produced it, there was used in its construction an amount of solar energy exactly equivalent to the energy which may be liberated by breaking the molecule to pieces. The total sum of the active and potential energy in the universe is thus at all times the same. ^ This magnificent conception has become the cornerstone of modern science. As soon as conceived it brought at once within its grasp B

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 133 chromosomes from both parents. It is not yet certain, however, whether the centrosome is a constant part of the cell. In some cells it cannot yet be found, and there are some reasons for be- lieving that it may be formed out of other parts of the cell. The nucleus is always a direct de- scendant from the nucleus of pre-existing cells, so that there is an absolute continuity of descent between the nucleii of the cells of an individual and those of its antecedents back for numberless generations. ^ It is not certain that there is any such continuity of descent in the case of the centrosomes; for, while in the process of fertiliza- tion the centrosome is handed down from parent to child, there are some reasons for believing that it may disappear in subsequent cells, and later be redeveloped out of other parts. The only part of the cell in which complete continuity from parent to child is demonstrated, is the nucleus and particularly the chromosomes. All of these facts simply emphasize the importance of the chromosomes, and tell us that these bodies must be regarded as containing the most import- ant features of the cell which constitute its individuality. WHAT IS PROTOPLASM? Enough has now been given of disclosures of the modern microscope to show that our old friend Protoplasm has assumed an entirely new guise, if indeed it has not disappeared altogether. These simplest life processes are so marvellous and involve the action of such an intricate mass of machinery that we can no longer retain our

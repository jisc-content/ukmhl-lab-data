68 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. with protoplasm and the living cell, since here, if anywhere, can we find the life substance reduced to its lowest terms. CHAPTER II. THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM—VITAL PROPERTIES. We have seen that the general activities of the body are intelligible according to chemical and mechanical laws, provided we can assume as their foundation the simple vital properties of living phenomena. We must now approach closer to the centre of the problem, and ask whether we can trace these fundamental pro- perties to their source and find an explanation of them. In the first place, what are these properties 1 The vital powers are varied, and lie at the basis of every form of living activity. When we free them from complications, however, they miiy all be reduced to four. These are: (1) IfTitcibility, or the property possessed by living matter of react- ing when stimulated. (2) Movement, or the power of contracting when stimulated. (3) Metaholism, or the power of absorbing extraneous food and pro- ducing in it certain chemical changes, which either convert it into more living tissue or break it to pieces to liberate the inclosed energy. (4) Repro- duction, or the power of producing new^ indi- viduals. From these four simple vital activities all other vital actions follow; and if we can find

190 THE STOKY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. two quite different views among biologists; and, while it is not our purpose to deal with disputed. points, these views are so essential to our subject, that they must be briefly referred to. ^ One class; of biologists adheres closely to the view already ' outlined, and insists for this reason that acquired! variations can not under any conditions _be^ in- herited. They insist that all inherited variations^ are congenital, and due therefore to direct varia- tions in the germ plasm, and that all instances oti seeming inheritance of acquired variations ares capable of other explanation. The other school i is equally insistent that there are abundant in- stances of the inheritance of acquired characters,;, claiming that these proofs are so strong as ta demand their acceptance. Hence this class of; biologists insists that the explanation of heredity} given as a simple handing down from generation to generation of a germ plasm is not completes and that while it is doubtless the foundation of heredity, it must be modified in some waj; so as to admit of the inheritance of acquiree. characters. j -u There is no question that has excited suen j wide interest in the biological world during thi last fifteen years as this one of the inheritance a acquired characters. Until about 1884 the quee: tion was not seriously raised. Heredity wa^ known to be a fact, and it was believed tha while congenital characters are more commonL inherited, acquired characters may also frequentl; be handed down from generation to generatmii The facts which we have noted of the contim ity of germ plasm have during the last tittee.

130 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. there appear to be, in the future history of this ecrs any actual fusion of the chromatic material, the’male and female chromosomes perhaps always remaining distinct. While this mixture of chromosomes has been taking place the centrosome has divided into two parts each of which becomes surrounded by an aster’and travels to opposite ends of the nucleus (Fig. 42). There now follows a division ot the nucleus exactly similar to that which occurs m Fig. 43. Fig. 44. J: l(Jr* “xO.

The egg has divided into two cells. the normal cell division already described in Fic^s 28-34 Each of the chromosomes splits lengthwise (Fig. 43), and one half of each then travels toward each centrosome to form a new nucleus (Fig. 44). Since each of the four somes thus splits, it follows that each of the two daughter nucleii will, of course, contain four chromosomes; two of which have been derive from the male and two from the female parent,

THE CELL AND TROTOPLASM. 125 but each of these two cells, the egg and the polar body, receives four chromosomes (Fig. 38). The result is that the egg has now the normal number of chromosomes for the ordinary cells of the ani- mal in question. Bat this is still too many, for the egg is soon to unite with the male cell; and this male cell, as we shall see, is to bring in its own quotg, of chromosomes. Hence the egg must get rid of still more of its chromatin material. Fig. 38. Fig. 39. Fig. 40.

Tfie centrosome has disappeared. Consequently, the first division is followed by a second (Fig. 39), in which there is again pro- duced a large and a small cell. This division, like the first, occurs without any splitting of the chromosomes, one half of the remaining chromo- somes being ejected in this new cell, the second polar cell (^c") leaving the larger cell, the egg.

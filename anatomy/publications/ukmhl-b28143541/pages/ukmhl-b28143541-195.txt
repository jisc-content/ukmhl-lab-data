THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 191 years led many biologists to deny the possibility of the latter. The debate which arose has con- tinued vigorously, and can not be regarded as settled at the present time. One result of this debate is clear. It has been shown beyond question that while the inheritance of congenital characters is the rule, the inheritance of acquired characters is at all events unusual. At the present time many naturalists would be inclined to think that the balance of evidence indicates that under certain conditions certain kinds of acquired characters may be inherited, although this is still disputed by others. Into this discus- sion we cannot enter here. The reason for refer- ring to it at all is, however, evident. We are searching for natureâ€™s method of building ma- chines. It is perfectly clear that variations among animals and plants are the foundations of the successive steps in advance made in this machine building, but of course only such varia- tions as can be transmitted to posterity can serve any purpose in this development. If there- fore it should prove that acquired characters can not be inherited, then we should no longer be able to look upon the direct influence of the sur- roundings as a factor in the machine building. We should then have nothing left except the con- genital variations produced by sexual union, or the direct variation of the germ plasm as a factor for advance. If, however, it shall prove that acquired characters may even occasionally be in- herited, then the direct effect of the environment upon the individual will serve as a decided assistance in our problem.

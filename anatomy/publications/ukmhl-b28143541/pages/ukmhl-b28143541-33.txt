29 PAET I. THE RUNNING OF THE LIVING MACHINE. CHAPTER I. IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? The problem before us in this section is to find out to what extent animals and plants are machines. We wish to determine whether the laws and forces which regulate their activities are the same as the laws and forces with which we experiment in the chemical and physical laboratory, and whether the principles of mechanics and the doctrine of the conserva- tion of energy apply equally well in the living machine and the steam engine. It might he inferred that the proper method of study would be to confine our attention largely to the simplest forms of life, since the problems would be here less complicated, and iherefore of easier solution. This, however, has not been nor can it be the method of study. Our knowledge of the processes of life has been derived largely from the most rather than the least complex forms. We have a better knowledge of the

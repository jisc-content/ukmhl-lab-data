85 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. V-/' Fig. 18.—Connective tis- sue. The cells of the tissue are shown at seems sometimes to be composed mostly of what we have called formed material. It must not be imagined, however, that a very rigid line can be drawn between the cell itself and the material it forms. The formed material is in many cases simply a thickened cell wall; and this we commonly regard as part of the cell. In many cases the formed material is simply the old dead cell walls c, ana the fibres or i i formed matter at/. irom Whlch the living substance has been withdrawn (Fig 14). In other cases the cell substance acquires peculiar functions, so that what seems to be the formed material is really a modified cell body and is still active and alive. Such is the case in the muscle. In other cases the formed material appears to be manufactured within the cell and secreted, as in the case of bone. No sharp lines can be drawn, however, between the various types. But the distinction between formed material and cell body is a convenient one and may well be retained in the discussion of cells. — In our discussion of the fundamental vital pro- Fig. 19.

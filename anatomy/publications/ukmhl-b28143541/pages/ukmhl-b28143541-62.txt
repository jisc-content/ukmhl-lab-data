58 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. there any demonstrable excretion of waste p^- ducts. This would be a serious objection to the conception of the nerve as a machine were it not for the fact that the nerve is so small that the total sum of its nervous energy must be very slight. The total energy of this minute machine is so slight that it cannot be detected by our comparatively rough instruments of measure- In short, all evidence goes to show that the nerve impulse is a form of motion, and h^ce o energy, correlated with other forms of physical energy. The nerve is, however, a very delicate machine, and its total amount of energy is very small. A tiny watch is a more delicate machine than a water-wheel, and its actions are more de- pendent upon the accuracy of its adjustment. The water-wheel may be made very coarse and yet be perfectly efficacious, while the watch be fashioned with extreme delicacy. Yet the water-wheel transforms vastly more energy than the watch. It may drive the many machines m a factory, while the watch can do no more th^ move itself. But who can doubt that the watch, as well as the water-wheel, is governed by the law of the correlation of forces ? So the nervous system of the living machine is delicately adjusted and easily put out of order, and its action in- volves only a small amount of energy ; but it is just as truly subject to the law of the conserva- tion of energy as is the more massive muscle. Sensations.—PviYsmng this subject further, we next notice that it is possible to trace a connec- tion between physical energy and sensations. Sen-

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. U7 descent. ^ Lastly, the cell has the centrosome, which brings about cell division in such a manner that this chromatin material is divided equally among the subsequent descendants, and thus insures that the daughter cells shall all be equivalent to each other and to the mother cell. VVe must therefore look upon the organic cell ^ admirably adapted parts. Within this engine chemical activity is excited. Ihe fuel supplied to the engine is combined by chemical forces with the oxygen of the air. The vigour of the oxidation is partly dependent upon temperature, just as it is in any other oxidation process, and is of course dependent upon the presence of fuel to be oxidised, and air to furnish the oxypn. Unless the fuel is supplied and the air has free access to it, the machine stops, the cell dies. The energy liberated in this machine ‘ w converted into motion or some other form. We do not indeed understand the construction of the machine well enough to explain the exact mechanism by which this conversion takes place but that there is such a mechanism can not be doubted, and the structure of the cell is certainly complex enough to give plenty of room for it. he irritability of the cell is easily understood • for, since it is made of very unstable chemical compounds, any slight disturbance or stimulation on one part will tend to upset its chemical sta- bility and produce reaction; and this is what is meant by irritability. Or, again we may look upon the cell as a little chemical laboratory, where chemical changes are constantly occurring. These changes we do not

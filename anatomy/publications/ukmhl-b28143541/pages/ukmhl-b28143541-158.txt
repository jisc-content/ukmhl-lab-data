154 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. nature has constructed the complex machines which we find filling the world to-day in the form of animals and plants. HISTORY OF THE LIVING MACHINE. In the first place, we must notice that these machines have not been fashioned suddenly or rapidly, but have been the result of a very slow growth. They have had a history extending very far back into the past for a period of years which we can only indefinitely estimate, but certainly reaching into the millions. As we look over this past history in the light of our present knowledge we see that whatever have been the forces which have been concerned in the construc- tion of these machines they have acted very slowly It has taken centuries, and, indeed, thousands of years, to take the successive steps which have been necessary in this construction. Secondly, we notice that the machines have been built up step by step, one feature being added to another with the slowly progressing ages. Thirdly, we notice that in one respect this con- struction of the living machine by nature’s pro- cesses has been different from our ordinary method of building machines. Our method ot building puts the parts gradually into place in such a way that until the machine is finished it is incapable of performing its functions. The halt- built engine is as useless and as powerless as so much crude iron. Its power ot action only appears after the last part is fitted into place and the machine finished. But nature’s process in

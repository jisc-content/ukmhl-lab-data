THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 209 this matter of the natural explanation of living phenomena, and to picture to ourselves more concisely our knowledge of the living machine. The problem we have set before us is to find out to what extent it is possible to account for vital phenomena by the application of ordinary natural laws and forces, and therefore to find out whether it is necessary to assume that there are forces needed to explain life w^hich are different from those found in other realms of nature, or whether vital forces are all correlated with physical forces. It has been evident at a glance that the living body is a machine. Like other machines it consists of parts adjusted to each other for the accomplishment of definite ends, and its action depends upon the adjustment of its parts. Like other machines, it neither creates nor destroys energy, but simply converts the potential energy of its foods into some form of active energy, and, like other machines, its power ceases when the machine is broken. With this understanding, the problem clearly resolved itself into two separate ones. The first was to determine to what extent known physical and chernical laws and forces are adequate to an explanation of the various phenomena of life. The second was to determine whether there are any known forces which can furnish a natural explanation of the origin of the living machine. Manifestly, if the first of these problems isinsolv- able, the second is insolvable also. In the study of the first problem we have reached the general conclusion that the secondary phenomena of life are readily explained by the Q

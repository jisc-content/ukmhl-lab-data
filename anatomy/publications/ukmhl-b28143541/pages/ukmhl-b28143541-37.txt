33 IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? SO much solar energ}^ which is stored up by the I agency of plant life, and the close comparison I between feeding the body to enable it to work and feeding the engine to enable it to develop energy is so evident that it demands no further idemonstration. The details of the problem may, 'however, present some diflScuIties. â€™ The first question which presents itself is whether the only power the body possesses is, as in the case with other machines, to transform energy without being able to create or destroy it ? Can every bit of energy shown by the living organism be accounted for by energy furnished in the food, and conversely can all the energy furnished in the food be found manifested in the living organism ? The theoretical answer to this question in :erms of the law of the conservation of energy s clear enough, but it is by no means so easy to inswer it by experimental data. To obtain ex- perimental demonstration it would be necessary >0 make an accurate determination of the amount )f energy an individual receives during a given Deriod, and at the same time a similar measure- nent of the amount of energy liberated in his pody either as motion or heat. If the body is a nachine, these two should exactly balance, and 1 they do not balance it would indicate that he living organism either creates or destroys mergy, and is therefore not a machine. Such ixperiments are exceedingly difficult. They nust be performed usually upon man rather han other animals, and it is necessary to Qclose an individual in an absolutely sealed 0

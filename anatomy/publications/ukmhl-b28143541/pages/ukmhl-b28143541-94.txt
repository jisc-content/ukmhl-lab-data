90 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. PROTOPLASM. (a) Discovery.—As it became evident that the cell wall is a somewhat inactive part of the cell, more attention was put on the cell contents. For twenty years after the formulation of the cell doctrine both the cell substance and the nucleus had been looked upon as essential to its activities. This was more especially true of the nucleus, which had been thought of as an organ of repro- duction. These suggestions appeared indefinitely in the writings of one scientist and another, and were finally formulated in 1860 into a general theory which formed what has sometimes been called the starting-point of modern biology. From that time the material known as protoplasm was elevated into a prominent position in the discussion of all subjects connected with living phenomena. The idea of protoplasm was first clearly defined by Schultze, who claimed that the real active part of the cell was the cell sub- stance within the cell wall. This substance he proved to be endowed with powers of motion and powers of inducing chemical changes asso- ciated with vital phenomena. He showed it to be the most abundant in the most active cells, becoming less abundant as the cells lose their ac- tivity, and disappearing when the cells lose their vitality. This cell substance was soon raised into a position of such importance that the smaller body within it was obscured, and for some twenty years more the nucleus was silently ignored in biological discussion. According to Schultze, the cell substance itself constituted the cell, the other

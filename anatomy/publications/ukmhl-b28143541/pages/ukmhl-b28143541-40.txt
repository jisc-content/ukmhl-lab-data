36 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. has gained in weight, which simply means that the extra energy has been stored in the body for future use. No more energy can be obtamed from the body than is furnished, and for all furnished in the food an equivalent amount is regained. There is no trace of any creation or destruction of energy. While, on account of the complexity of the experimenting, an absolutely strict balance sheet cannot be made, all the results are of the same nature. So far as con- cerns measurable energy, all the facts collected bear out the theoretical conception that tRe living body is to be regarded as a machine which converts the potential energy of chemical composition, stored passively in its lood,into active energy of motion and heat. It is found, however, that the body is a machine of a somewhat superior grade, since it is able to convert this potential energy into motion with less loss than the ordinary machine. As noticed above, in all machines a portion of the energy is converted into heat and rendered unavailab e by radiating into space. In an ordinary engine only about one-fifteenth of the energy furnished in the coal can be regained in the forin of motive power, the rest being radiated from the machine as heat. Some of our better engines to-day utilize a somewhat larger part, but most of them utilize less than one-tenth. The experiments with the living body in the respiration appara- tus above described, give a means of determining the proportion of the energy furnished m the form of food which can be utilized in the form of motive force. This figure appears to be

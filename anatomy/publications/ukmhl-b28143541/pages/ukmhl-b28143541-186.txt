182 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. Of the fact of these variations there is no question, and the matter need not detain Every one has had too many experiences to ask for proof. Of the nature of the variations, how- eve^! there are some points to be which are very erermane to our subject, in t first place, we must notice that these variations are of two kinds. There is one class which is born with the individual, so that they are nresent from the time of birth. In saying that SSrvarStions are born with the individual we do not necessarily mean that they are externally apparent at birth. A child may parents characters which do not appear till adu t hfe.

It appears only m later life but it is none the less an inborn character. ^ In the same way, we may have many inborn variations among indl;iduals which do not make themselves seen until adult life, but which are none the less “nate The offspring of the same parents may show decided differences, although they are put under similar conditions, and such differences are of course inherent in the nature of the indmdnal. Such variations are called congemtal vanatims. There is however, a second class of variations i which are not born in the arise as the result of some conditions affectin^ its. nfter-life The most extreme instances ot tins- kind are’ mutilations. Some men have on\y °n®‘ leg because the other has been lost by ac®ident.. Here is a variation acquired as the resi circumstances. A blacksmith differs from other

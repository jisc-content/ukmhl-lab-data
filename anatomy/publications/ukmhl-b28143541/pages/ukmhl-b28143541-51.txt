IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 47 Now in this circulation we have again to do with chemical and physical forces. All of its general ^ phenomena are based upon purely mechanical principles. The action of the heart —leaving out of consideration for a moment its muscular power—is that of a simple pump. It is provided with valves whose action is as simple and as easy to understand as those of any water pump. By the action of these valves the blood is kept circulating in one direction. The blood- vessels are elastic, and the study of the effect of a liquid pumped rhythmically into elastic tubes explains with simplicity the various phenomena associated with the circulation. Bor example, the rhythmically contracting heart forces a small quantity of blood into the arteries at short inter- vals. These tubes are large near the heart, but smaller at their ends, where they flow into the veins, so that the blood does not flow out into the veins so readily as it flows in from the heart. 1 he jet of blood that is sent in with every beat of the heart slightly stretches the artery, and the tention thus produced causes the blood to con- tinue to flow between the beats. But the heart continues beating, and there is an accumulation of the blood in the arteries until it exists under * some pressure—a pressure sufficient to force it rapidly through the small ends of the arteries into the veins. After passing into the veins the pressure is at once removed, since the veins are larger than the arteries, and there is no resist- ance to the flow of the blood. Hence the blood in the arteries is under pressure, while there is little or no pressure in the veins. Into the

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 95 (NHg), and passing up through a large number of members of greater and greater complexity, ail composed, however, chiefly of the elements carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Our chemists found that starting with simple sub- stances they could, by proper means, combine them into molecules of greater complexity, and in so doing could make many of the compounds that had hitherto been produced only as a result of living activities. For example, urea, formic acid, indigo, and many other bodies hitherto pro- duced only by animals and plants, were easily pro- duced by the chemist by purely chemical methods. Now when protoplasm had been discovered as the “ physical basis of life,” and, when it was fur- ther conceived that this substance is a proteid related to albumens, it was inevitable that a theory should arise which found the explanation of life in accordance with simple chemical laws. If, as chemists and biologists then believe, protoplasm is a compound which stands at the head of the organic series, and if, as is the fact, chemists are each year succeeding in making higher and higher members of the series, it is an easy assumption that some day they will be able to make the highest member of the series. Further, it is a well-known fact that simple chemical compounds have simple physical pro- perties, while the higher ones have more varied properties. Water has the property of being liquid at certain temperatures and solid at others, and of dividing into small particles {i.e. dissolving) certain bodies brought in contact with it. ThQ higher compound albumen has,

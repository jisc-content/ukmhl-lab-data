IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 51 while if the pressure be below this point the union is at once destroyed, and the oxyeen leaves the haemoglobin to become free. All of this is a purely chemical matter, and can be demonstrated at will in a test tube in the labora- tory. But this union and disassociation is just foundation of respiration, i he blood coming to the lungs contains haemo- globin, and since the oxygen pressure in the air IS. this haemoglobin unites at once with a quantity of oxygen while the blood is flowing through the air-vessels. The blood is then carried off in the circulation to the active tissues like the muscles. These tissues are con- stantly using oxygen to carry on their life pro- cesses, and constantly at all times use up about all the oxygen within their reach. The result is that in these tissues the oxygen pressure is very low and when the oxygen-laden haemoglobin reaches them the association of the haemoglobin with oxygen is at once broken up and the oxygen set free in the tissue. It passes at once to the lymph, from which the active tissues seize it for the purpose of carrying on the oxidizing processes of the body. This whole matter of supplying the body with oxygen is thus fundamentally a chemical one, controlled by chemical laws. Removal of Waste.â€”The next step in this life process is one of diflBculty. After the food and oxygen have reached the tissues it is seized by the iving cell. The food material is now oxi- dized by the oxygen, and its latent energy is liberated, and appears in the form of motion or

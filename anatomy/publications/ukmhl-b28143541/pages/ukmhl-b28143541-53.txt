IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 49 ■ a. which passed into the blood in the intestine through the influence of the osmotic force, now pass out into the lymph under the influence of the same force The food is thus brought into contact with the living muscle fibres, these fibres are now able to take directly from the lymph the material needed for their use. The power which enables the muscle fibre to take the piatenal it needs, discard- ing the rest, is, again, one of the vital processes which we defer for a moment. Respiration. — Pursuing the same line of study, we turn for a moment to the relation of the circulatory system to the function of supplying the body with oxjgen gas. Oxygen is absolutely needed to carry -nn '*'- on the functions of life; nr « a k-. , for these, like those of "'"scie with the engine, are based upon the oxidation of the fuel. The oxygen is derived from the air in the sim- plest manner. During its circulation the blood is brought for a fraction of a second into practical contact with air. This occurs in the lungrwheTe there are great numbers of air cells, in the walls which the blood-vessels are distributed in great profusion. While the blood is in these veSs D - YYItll Its blood-vessels: a, the muscle fibres ; b, the minule blood - vessels. The fibres and vessels are bathed in lymph (not shown in the figure) and food material passes through the walls of the blood - vessels into this lymph.

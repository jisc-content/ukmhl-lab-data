THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 115 twenty-four. During this process of the forma- tion of the chromosomes the nucleoli disappear, sometimes being absorbed apparently in the chromosomes, and sometimes being ejected into the cell body, where they disappear. Whether they have anything to do with further changes is not yet known. The next step in the process of division appears ce 27. Fia. 28. following figures show stages in cell division, g. 27 shows the resting stage with the chromatin, cr, in the form of a netwoi±, within the nuclear membrane and the centrosome ce, already divided into two. chromatin is broken into threads or chromosomes, cr. The centrosomes show radiating fibres. ’ in the region of the centrosomes. Each of the two centrosomes appears to send out from itself delicate radiating fibres into the surrounding cell substance (Fig. 28). Whether these actually arise from the centrosome or are simply a re- arrangement of the fibres in the cell substance IS not clear, but at all events the centrosome becomes surrounded by a mass of radiating fibres

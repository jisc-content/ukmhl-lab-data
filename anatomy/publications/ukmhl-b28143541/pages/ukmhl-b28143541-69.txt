65 IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? by no other machine. Living machines alone inci ease the amount of chemical compounds of hiah complexity. . j y We must notice, however, that this power of construction in distinction from destruction is possessed only by one special class of living machines. Green plants alone can thus increase the store of organic compounds in the world. All colourless plants and all animals, on the other iiancl, live by destroying these compounds and using the energy thus liberated; in this respect being more like ordinary artificial machines. The animal does indeed perform certain constructive operations, manufacturing complex material out of sirnpler bodies; as, for example, making fats out of starches. But in this operation it de- stroys a large amount of organic material to turnish the energy for the construction, so that the total result is a degradation of chemical compounds rather than a construction. Con- structive processes, which increase the amount ot high compounds in nature, are confined to the iving inachine, and indeed to one special form of It, VIZ the green plant. This constructive power radically separates the living from other machines ; for while constructive processes are possible to the chemist, and while engines mak- ing use of sunlight are possible, the living machine is the only machine that increases the amount of high chemical compounds in the E

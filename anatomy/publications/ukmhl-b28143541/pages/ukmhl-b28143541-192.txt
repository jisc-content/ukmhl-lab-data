188 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. reproduction is a device adopted for bringing out such congenital variations. INHERITANCE OF VARIATIONS. The reason why congenital variations are needed for the evolution of the living machine is clear enough. Evanescent variations can have no effect upon this machine, for they would disappear with the individual in which they appeared. In order that they should have any influence in the pro- cess of machine building they must be permanent ones; or, in other words, they must be inherited from generation to generation. Only as such variations are transmitted by heredity can they be added to the structure of the developing machine. Therefore we must ask whether the variations are inherited. ^ ^ ^ In regard to the congenital variations there! can be no difficulty. The very fact that they are congenital shows us that they have been pro-- duced by variations in the germ plasm, and as> such they must be transmitted, not only to the) next generation, but to all following generations,, until the germ plasm becomes again modified., This germ plasm is handed on from generationi to generation with all its variations, and hence) the variations will be added permanently to thee machine. Congenital variations are thus a means^ for permanently modifying the organism, and by\ their agency must we in large measure believei that evolution through the ages has taken place. With the acquired variations the matter stands: quite differently. We can readily understand

35 IS THE BODY A MACHINE? is immediately seen in a rise in temperature of the apparatus. But even with this delicacy the apparatus is comparatively coarse, and can measure only the most apparent forms of energy. The more subtile types of energy such as nervous force, if this is to be regarded as energy, do not make any impression on the apparatus. The obstacles in the way of these experiments do not particularly concern us, but the general results are of the greatest significance for our purpose. While, for manifest reasons, it has mot been possible to carry on these experi- 1 ments for any great length of time, and while 1 t accurately I refined, they are all of one kind and teach un- hesitatingly one conclusion. So far as concerns measurable energy or measurable material, the machine. If the body IS to do work in this respiration [apparatus, it does so only by breaking to pieces la certain amount of food and using the energy thus liberated, and the amount of food needed is proportional to the amount of work done. When the individual simply walks across the floor, or ^ven rises from his chair, this is accompanied by an increase in the amount of food material broken up and a consequent increase in the amount of refuse matter eliminated and the heat pyen ofl. The income and outgo of the body in both matter and energy is balanced. If, during the experimental period, it is found that less energy is liberated than that contained in the food assimilated, it is also found that the body

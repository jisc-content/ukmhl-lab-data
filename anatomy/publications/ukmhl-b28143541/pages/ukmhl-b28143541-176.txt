172 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. plies by eggs, we find that in all cases the fundamental feature of the process is division. In all cases the organism divides into two or more parts, each of which becomes in time like the original. Moreover, when we trace this division further we find that in all cases it is to be referred back to the division of the cell, such as we have described in a previous chapter. The egg is a single cell which has come from the parent by the division of one of the cells in the body of the parent. A bud is simply a mass of cells which have all arisen from the parent cells by division. The foundation of reproduction is thus in all cases cell division. Now, this process of division is dependent upon the properties^ of the cell. Firstly, it is a result of the assimila- tive powers of the cell, for only through assimi- lation can the cell increase in size, and only as it increases in size can it gain sustenance for cell division. Secondly, it is dependent, as we have seen, upon the' mechanism of the cell body, and especially the nucleus and centrosome. These structures regulate the cell division, and heime the reproduction of all animals and plants. We can not, therefore, find any explanation of repro- duction until we have explained the mechanism of the cell. The fundamental feature of nature’s . machine building is thus based upon the machinery of the nucleus and centrosome of the organic cell. Aside from the simple fact that it preserves; the race, the most important feature connected I with this reproduction is its wonderful fruitful-- ness. Since it results from division, it always = tends to increase the offspring in geometrical 1

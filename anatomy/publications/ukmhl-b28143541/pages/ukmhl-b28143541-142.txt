138 THE STORY OF LIFE S MECHANISM. and, above all, the fact that the nucleus alone is handed down from one generation to the next in reproduction, all attested to its great importance and to the secondary importance of the rest of the cell. . . ,, This was the most extreme position ot the ceil doctrine. The cell was the unit of living action, and the higher animal or plant simply a colony of such units. An animal was simply an associa- tion together for mutual advantage of indepen- dent units, just as a city is an association of independent individuals. The organization ot the animals was simply the result of the com- bination of many independent units. was no activity of the organism as a whole, but only of its independent parts. Cell life was superior to organized life. Just as, in a city, the city government is a name given to the combined action of the individuals, so are the actions of organisms simply the combined action of their individual cells. Against such an extreme position there has been in recent years a decided reaction, and to-day it is becoming more and more evident that such a position cannot be maintained. In the first place, it is becoming evident that the cell substance is not to be entirely obliterated by the importance of the nucleus. That the nucleus is a most important vital centre is clear enough, but it is equally clear that nucleus and cell substance must be together to constitute the life substance. The complicated structure of the cell substance, the decided activity shown by its fibres in the process of cell division, clearly enough indicate

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 137 build machines by the adjustment of parts to each other. But this topic belongs to the second part of our subject, and must be for the present post- poned. REACTION AGAINST THE CELL DOCTRINE. As the knowledge of cells which we have out- lined was slowly acquired, the conception of the cell passed through various modifications. At first the cell wall was looked upon as the funda- mental part, but this idea soon gave place to the belief that it was the protoplasm that was alive. Under the influence of this thought, the cell doctrine developed into something like the fol- lowing : The cell is simply a bit of protoplasm and is the unit of living matter. The bodies of all larger animals and plants are made up of great numbers of these units acting together, and the activities of the entire organism are simply the sum of the activities of its cells. The organism is thus simply the sum of the cells which compose it, and its activities the sum of the activities of the individual cells. As more facts were disclosed the idea changed slightly. The importance of the nucleus became more and more forcibly impressed upon micro- scopists, arid this body came after a little into such prominence as to hide from view the more familiar protoplasm. The marvellous activities of the nucleus soon caused it to be regarded as the important part of the cell, while all the rest was secondary. The cell was now thought of as a bit of nuclear matter surrounded by secondary parts. The marvellous activities of the nucleus.

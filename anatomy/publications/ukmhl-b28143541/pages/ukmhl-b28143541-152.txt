148 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. indeed understand, but they are undoubtedly chemical changes. The result is that some com- pounds are pulled to pieces and part of the fragments liberated or excreted, while other parts are retained and built into other more complex compounds. The compounds thus manu- factured are retained in the cell body, and i grows in bulk. This continues until the cell becomes too big, and then it divides. If a machine is broken it ceases to carry on its proper duties, and if the parts are bad y broken it is ruined. So with the cell. If is broken by any means, mechanical, thermal, or otherwise, it ceases to run—we say it dies. It has within itself great power of repairing injury, and therefore it does not cease to ac until the injury is so great as to be beyond repair. Thus it only stops its motion when the machinery has become so badly injured as to be beyond hope of repair, and hence the cell, after once ceasing its action, can never resume i There are, of course, other functions of living things besides the few simple ones which we have considered. But these are the funda- mental ones ; and if we can reduce them to an intelligible explanation, we may feel that we have really grasped the essence of lite. It we understand how the cell can move and grow and reproduce itself, we may rest assured that the other phenomena of life follow as a natural rcrs;. A “2. phenomena, we have accomplished oui object

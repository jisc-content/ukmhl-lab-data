212 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. contains within itself the power of guiding this play of chemical force in such a way as to give rise to vital phenomena, and our search must be not for chemical force, but for this guiding principle. Our study of protoplasm has told us clearly enough that we must find this guiding principle in the interaction of the machineiy within the protoplasm. The microscope has told us plainly that these fundamental principles are based upon machinery. The cell division (repro- duction) is apparently controlled by the centro- some; the heredity by the chromosomes; the constructive metabolism by the nucleus in general, while the destructive metabolism is also seated in the cell substance outside the nucleus. Whether these statements are strictly accurate in detail does not particularly affect the general conclusion. It is clearly enough demonstrated that the activi- ties of the protoplasmic body are dependent upon the relation of its different parts. Although we have got rid of the complicated machinery of the organism in general, we are still confronted Avith the machinery of the cell. But our analysis cannot, at present, go further. Our knowledge of this machine has not as yet enabled us to gain any insight as to its method. of action. We cannot yet conceive how this- machine controls the chemical and physical forces? at its disposal in such a way as to produce the' orderly result of life. The strict correlation i between the forces of the physical universe and; those manifested by this protoplasm tells us that! a transformation of energy occurs Avithin it, but; of the method of that transformation Ave as yet:

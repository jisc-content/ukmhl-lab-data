101 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. SO far from being undifferentiated protoplasm, was not an organic product at all, but simply a mineral deposit in the sea water made by purely artificial means. Bathybias stands therefore as an instance of a too precipitate advance in specula- tion, which led even such a brilliant man as Prof. Huxley into an unfortunate error of observation j for, beyond question, he would never have made such a mistake had he not been dominated by his speculative theories as to the nature of protoplasm. But although Bathybias proved delusive, this did not materially affect the advance and develop- ment of the doctrine of protoplasm. Simple forms of protoplasm were found, although none quite so simple as the hypothetical Bathybias. The universal presence of protoplasm in the living parts of all animals and plants and its naanifest activities completely demonstrated that it was the only living substance, and as the result of a few years of experiment and thought the biologist s conception of life crystallised into something like this : Living organisms are made of cells, but these cells are simply minute in- dependent bits of protoplasm. They may con- tain a nucleus or they may not, but the essence of the cell is the protoplasm, this alone hav- ing the fundamental activities of life. These bits of living matter aggregate themselves to- gether into groups to form colonies. Such colonies are animals or plants. The cells divide the wnrk of the colony among themselves, each cell adopting a form best adapted for the special work it has to do. The animal or plant is thus simply an aggregate of cells, and its activities are

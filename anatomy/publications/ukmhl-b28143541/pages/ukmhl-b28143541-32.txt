28 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. phenomena of life we have two entirely different problems. The first is manifestly to account for the existence of this machine, for such a com- ^ pleted piece of mechanism as a man^ or a tree cannot be explained as a result of simple acci- | dent, as the existence of a rough piece of rock | might be explained. Its intricacy of parts and their purposeful interrelation demands explana- tion, and therefore the fundamental problem is to explain how this machine came into existence. The second problem is simpler, for it is simply to explain the running of the machine after it is made. If the organism is really a machine, we ought to be able to find some way of explaining its actions as we can those of a steani engine. Of these two problems the first is the more fundamental, for if we fail to find an explana- tion for the existence of the machine, our ex- planation of its method of action is only partly satisfactory. But the second question is the simpler, and must be answered first. ^Ve cannot hope to explain the more puzzling matter of the origin of the machioe unless we can fiist under- stand how it acts. In our treatment of the sub- ject, therefore, we shall divide it into two parts: I. The Running of the Living Machine. II. The Origin of the Living Machine.

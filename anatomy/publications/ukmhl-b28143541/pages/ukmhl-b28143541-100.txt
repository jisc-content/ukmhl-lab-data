96 THE STORY 0Â¥ LIFE'S MECHANISM. however, a great number of properties and possibilities of combination far beyond those of water. Now if the properties increase in com- plexity with the complexity of the compound, it is again an easy assumption that when we reach a compound as complex as protoplasm, it will have properties as complex as those of the simple life substance. Nor was this such a very wild hypothesis. After all, the funda- mental life activities may all be traced to the simple oxidation of food, for this results in movement, assimilation, and growth, and the result of growth is reproduction. It was there- fore only necessary for our biological chemists to suppose that their chemical compound proto- plasm possessed the power of causing certain kinds of oxidation to take place, just as water itself induces a simpler kind of oxidation, and they would have a mechanical explanation of the life activities. It was certainly not a very absurd assumption to make, that this substance protoplasm could have this power, and from this the other vital activities are easily derived. In other words, the formulation of the doctrine of protoplasm made it possible to assume that life is not a distinct force, but simply a name given to the properties possessed by that highly complex chemical compound protoplasm. Just as we might give the name aguacity to the pro- perties possessed by water, so we have actually given the name vitality to the properties possessed by protoplasm. To be sure, vitality is more marvellous than aquacity, but so is protoplasm a more complex compound than water. This

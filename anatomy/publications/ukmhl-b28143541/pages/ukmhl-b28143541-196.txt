192 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. Here, then, we have before us the factors which have been concerned in the building of the living machine under nature’s hands. Repro- • duction keeps in existence a constantly active, unstable, readily modified organism as a basis! upon which to build. Variation offers constantly new modifications of the type, while heredity’ insures that the modifications produced in the? machine by the influences which give rise to the; variations shall be permanently fixed. METHOD OF MACHINE BUILDING. Natural Selection.—The method by which these3 factors have worked together to build up the3 living machines is easily understood in its general! aspects, although there are many details as yetD unsolved. The general facts connected with the3 evolution of animals are matters of cominoni knowledge.. We need do no more than outlinee the subject, since it is well understood by all.. The basis of the method is natural selectioUy, which acts in this machine building something: as follows: The law of reproduction, as we have seen, pro-*^ duces new individuals with extraordinary rapidity,' and as a result more individuals are born than; can possibly find sustenance in the world. Hencei only a few of the offspring of any animal or plant! can live long enough to produce offspring in turnj. The many must die that the few may live; and; there is, therefore, a constant struggle among thei individuals that are born for food or for room in the world. In this struggle for existence of coursot

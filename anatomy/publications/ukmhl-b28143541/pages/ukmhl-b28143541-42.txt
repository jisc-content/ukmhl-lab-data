38 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. as a foundation, we can readily explain the running of the machine. Our next problem, therefore, is to see if we can in the same way reach an understanding of the phenomena ot the living machine. Can we, by the use of the same chemical and physical forces, explain the activities taking place in the living organisin'? Can the motion of the body, for example, be made as intelligible as the motion of the steam engine ? PHYSICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CHIEF VITAL FUNCTIONS. The living machine is, of course, vastly more complicated than the steam engine, and there are many different processes which must be considered separately. There is not space in a work of this size to consider them all carefully, but we may select a few of the vital functions as illustrations of the method which is pursued. It will be assumed that the fundamental processes of human physiology are understood by the reader, and we shall try to interpret some of them in terms ot chemical and physical force. Dwesto.—The first step m this transformation of fuel is the process of digestion. Now this pro- cess of digestion is nothing mysterious, nor does it involve any peculiar or special forces. DigesMon of food is simply a chemical change therein, i be food which is taken into the body in the form ot sugar, starch, fat or proteid, is acted upon by the digestive juices in such a way that its chemical nature is slightly changed. But the changes tha thus occur are not peculiar to the living body.

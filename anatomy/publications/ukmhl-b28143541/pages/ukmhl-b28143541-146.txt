142 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. Still contain potentially the organization of the whole adult, or only one half of it ? Is the development of the egg simply the unfolding ot some structure already present; or is the struc- ture constantly developing into more and more complicated conditions owing to the bringing ot its parts into new relations 1 To answer these questions experimenters have been engaged in dividing developing eggs into pieces to determine what powers are still possessed by the fragmen^ts. The results of such experiments are as yet rather conflicting, but it is evident enough from them that we can no longer look upon the egg cell as a simple unditferentiated cell. In some way it already contains the characters of the adult, and when we remember that the characters ot the adult which are to be developed from the egg are already determined, even to «iany minute details—such, for instance, as the inheritance ot a congenital mark—it becomes evident that the egg is a body of extraordinary complexity. And vet the egg is nothing more than a single cell agreeing with other cells in all its general charac- ters. It is clear, then, that we must look upon organization as something superior to cells and something existing within them, or at least with- in the egg cell, and controlling its development. We are forced to believe, further, that there may be as important differences between two cells as there are between two adult animals or plant^s. In some way there must be concealed within the two cells which constitute the egg of the starfish and the man differences which correspond to the differences between the starfish and the man.

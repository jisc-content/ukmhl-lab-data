THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 179 A represents an egg of a starfish. From one half, the unshaded portion, develops the starfish of the next generation, B. The other is distributed without change in the ovaries, ov, of the in- dividual, B. From these ovaries arises the next egg, A', with its germ plasm. This germ plasm is evident- ly identical with that in A, since it is merely a bit of the same handed down through the indi- vidual, B. In the de- velopment of the next generation the process is repeated, and hence B' will be like B, and the third generation of eggs Identical with the first and second. The undifferentiated part of the germ plasm is thus simply handed on from one generation to the next. Fig. 60.-Dlagram Illustrating the principle of heredity. cells. During the life of the individual this germ plasm xs capable of increasing in amount without

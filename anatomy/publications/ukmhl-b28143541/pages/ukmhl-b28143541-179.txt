THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 175 inheritance. There are plenty of puzzling pro- blems connected with heredity, but the fact of heredity is one of the foundation stones of bio- logical science. Upon it must be built all theories which look toward the explanation of the origin of the living machine. This factor of heredity again we must trace back to the machinery of the cell. TV^e have seen in the previous pages evidence for the wonderful nature of the chromosomes of the cells. We can not pretend to understand them, but they must be extraordinarily complex. We have seen proof that these chromosomes are probably the physi- cal basis of heredity, since they are the only parts of each parent which are handed down to subsequent generations. With these various facts of cell division and cell fertilization in mind, we can reach a very simple explanation of funda- mental features of heredity. The following is an outline of the most widely accepted view of the hereditary process. Recognizing that the chromosomes are the physical basis of hereditary transmission, we can picture to ourselves the transmission of hereditary characters something as follows : As we have seen, the fertilized egg contains an equal number of chromosomes from each parent (Fig. 42). Now when this fertilized cell divides, each of the rods splits lengthwise, half of each entering each of the two cells arising from the cell division. From this method of division of the chromosomes it follows that the daughter cells would be equiva- lent to each other and equivalent also to the un- divided egg. If the original chromosomes con-

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 79 matter of simple inference. It was argued that since cell origin begins in this way by simple division, and since the same process can be ob- served in the adult, it is reasonable to assume that the same process has continued uninter- ruptedly, and that this is the only method of cell origin. But a final demonstration of this conclusion was not forthcoming for a long time. For many years some biologists continued to believe that cells can have other origin than from pre-existing cells. Year by year has the evidence for such “ free cell” origin become less, until the view has been entirely abandoned, and to-day it is everywhere admitted that new cells always arise from old ones by direct descent, and thus every cell in the body of an animal or plant is a direct descendant by division from the original egg cell. THE CELL. But what is this cell which forms the unit of life, and to which all the fundamental vital pro- perties can be traced ? We will first glance at the structure of the cell as it was understood by the earlier microscopists. A typical cell is shown in Fig. 9. It will be seen that it consists of three quite distinct parts. There is first the cell wall {cw) which is a limiting membrane of varying thickness and shape. This is in reality life- less material, and is secreted by the rest of the cell. Beiug thus produced by the other active parts of the cell, we will speak of it as formed material in distinction from the rest, which is active material. Inside this vesicle is contained

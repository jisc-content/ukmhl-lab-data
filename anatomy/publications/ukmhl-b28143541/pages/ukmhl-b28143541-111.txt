THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 107 of carrying on their life activities for a while. The pieces of the cell which contain the nucleus of the original cell, or even a part of it, are capable of carrying on all its life activities perfectly well. In Fig. 24 is shown such a cell cut into three pieces, each of which con- tains a piece of the nucleus. Each carries on Its life activities, feeds, grows and multiplies perfectly well, the life pro- cesses seeming to continue as if nothing had happened. Quite different is it with frag- ments which contain none of the nucleus (Fig.25). These fragments (1 and 3), even though they may be com- p a ra t i vely large masses of protoplasm, are incapable of carrying on the functions of their life continu- ously. For a while they continue to move around and apparently act like the other fragments, but after a little their life ceases. They are incapable of assimilating food and incapable of reproduc- tion, and hence their life cannot continue very Fig. 24.â€”a cell cut into three pieces, each contflinin^ a, bit of the nucleus. Each, con- tinues its lifo indefinitely, soon acouiring the form of the original as at <7.

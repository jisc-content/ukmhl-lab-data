123 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. ing is a general description of the process derived from the study of a large variety of animals and plants. In the^ cells of the body of the animal to which this description applies there are four chromosomes. This is true of all the cells of the animal except the sexual cells. The eggs arise from_ the other cells of the body, but during their growth the chromatin splits in such a way that the egg contains double the number Fig. 34. Fig. 3.'5. following figures represent the process of fertilization of an egg. In all figures cr is the chromosomes* cs represents the cell substance (omitted in the following n^^es) ; me is the male reproductive cell lying in contact Fin nucleus after entering the egg Fig. 35.â€”The egg centrosome has divided, and the male cell with its centrosome has entered the egg of chromosomes, i.e. eight (Fig. 34). If this egg should now unite with the other reproductive cell from the male, the resulting fertilized egg would plainly contain a number of chromosomes larger than that normal for this species of animal. As a result the next generation would have a larger number of chromosomes in each cell than

THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 139 that it is a part of the cell which can not be neglected in the study of the life substance. Again the discovery of the centrosome as a distinct morphological element has still further added to the complexity of the life substance, and proved that neither nucleus nor cell sub- stance can be regarded as the cell or as consti- tuting life. It is true that we may not yet know the source of this centrosome. We do not know whether it is handed down from generation to generation like the nucleus, or whether it can be made anew out of the cell substance in the life of an ordinary cell. But this is not material to its recognition as an organ of importance in the cell activity. Thus the cell proves itself not to be a bit of nuclear matter surrounded by secondary parts, but a community of several perhaps equally important interrelated members. Another series of observations weakened the cell doctrine in an entirely different direction. It had been assumed that the body of the multi- cellular animal or plant was made of independent units. Microscopists of a few years ago began to suggest that the cells are in reality not separated from each other, but are all connected by proto- plasmic fibres. ^ In quite a number of different kinds of tissue it has been determined that fine threads of protoplasmic material lead from one cell to another in such a way that the cells are in vital connection. The claim has been made that there is thus a protoplasmic connection be- tween all the cells of the body of the animal, and that thus the animal or plant, instead of

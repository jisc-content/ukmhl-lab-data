184 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. planation of these variations. With the acquired variations we have no particular trouble, for they are easily explained as due to the direct action of the environment upon animals. One of the fun- damental characters of the living protoplasm (using the word now in its widest sense) is its extreme instability. So unstable is it that any disturbing influence will affect it. If two similar unicellular organisms are placed under different conditions they become unlike, since their un- stable protoplasm is directly affected by the sur- rounding conditions. With higher animals the process is naturally a little more complicated; but here, too, they are easily understood as part of the function of the machine. One of the ad- justments of the machine is such that when any organ is used more than usual the whole machine reacts in such a way as to send more blood to this special organ. The result is a change in the nutrition of the organ and a corresponding varia- tion in the individual. Thus acquired variations are simply functions of the action of the machine. Congenital variations, however, can not receive such an explanation. Being born with the indi- vidual, they can not be produced by conditions affecting him, but rather by something affect- ing the germ plasm from which he sprung. The nature of the germ plasm controls the nature of the individual, and congenital variations must consequently be due to its variations. But it is not so easy to see how this germ plasm can un- dergo variation. The conditions which surround the individual would affect its body, but it is not easy to believe that they would affect the ger-

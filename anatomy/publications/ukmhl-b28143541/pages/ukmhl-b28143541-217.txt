THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 213 know nothing. Irritability, movement, metabo- lism, and reproduction appear to be not chemical properties of a compound, but mechanical pro- perties of a machine. Our mechanical analysis of the living machine stops short before it reaches any foundation in the chemical forces of nature. It is thus clearly apparent that the pheno- mena of life are dependent upon the machinery of living things, and we have therefore the second question of the origin of this machinery to answer. Chemical forces and mechanical forces have been laboriously investigated, but neither appear adequate to the manufacture of machines. They produce only chemical compounds and worlds with their mountains and seas. The construction of artificial machines has demanded intelligence. But here is a natural machine—the organism. It is the only machine produced by natural methods, so far as we know; and we have, therefore, next asked whether there are, in nature, simple forces competent to build machines such as living animals and plants ? In pursuance of this question we have found that the complicated machines have been built out of the simpler ones by the action of known forces and laws. The factors in this machine building are simply those of the fundamental vital properties of the simplest protoplasmic machine. Reproduction, heredity, and variation, acting under the ever-changing conditions of the earth’s surface, are apparently all that are needed to explain the building of the complex machines out of the simpler ones. Nature has forces ade-

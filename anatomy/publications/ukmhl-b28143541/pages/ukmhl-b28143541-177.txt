THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 173 ratio. In the simplest case, that of the uni- cellular animals, the cell divides, giving rise to two animals, each of which divides again, pro- ducing four, and these again, giving eight, &c. The rapidity of this multiplication is sometimes inconceivable. It depends, of course, upon the interval of time between the successive divisions, but among the lower organisms this interval is sometimes not more than half an hour, the result of which is that a single individual could give rise in the course of twenty-four hours to sixteen million offspring. This is doubtless an extreme case, but among all the lower animals the rate is very great. Among larger animals the process IS more complicated; but here, too, there is the same tendency to geometrical progression, al- though the intervals between the successive reproductions may be quite long and irregular. But it is always so great that if allowed to progress unhindered at its normal rate the off- spring would, in a few years, become so numer- ous as to crowd other life out of existence. Even the slow-breeding elephant would, if allowed to breed unhindered for seven hundred and fifty years, produce nineteen million offspring—a rate oi increase plainly incompatible with the con- tinued existence of other animals. Here, then, we have the foundation of nature’s naethod of building animals and plants of the higher classes. In the machinery of the cell she has a power of reproduction which produces an increase in geometrical ratio far beyond the possibility for the surface of the earth to main- tain.

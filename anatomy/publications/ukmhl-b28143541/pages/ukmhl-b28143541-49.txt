IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 45 while we do not yet know very much about them, they are of the same sort as those of digesiion, and involve probably nothing more than chemical processes. Secondly, we notice that there is one phase of absorption which is still obscure. Part of the food is composed of fat, and this fat, as the result of digestion, is mechanically broken up into extremely minute droplets. Although these droplets are of microscopic size they are not actually in solution, and therefore not sub- ject to the force of osmosis which only affects solutions. The osmotic force will not force fat drops through membranes, and to explain their passage through the walls of the intestine re- quires something additional. We are as yet, however, able to give only a partial explanation of this matter. ^ The inner wall of the intestine is not an inert, lifeless membrane, but is made of active bits of living matter. These bits of living matter appear to seize hold of the droplets of oil by means of little processes which they thrust out, and then pass them through their own bodies to excrete them on their inner surface into the blood-vessels. Fig. 5 shows a few of these living bits of the membrane, each con- taining^ several such fat droplets. This fat absorption thus appears to be a vital process, and not one simply controlled by physical forces like osmosis. Here our explanation runs against what we call vital power of the ultimate elements of the body. The consideration of this vital feature we must, of course, investigate further â€¢ but this will be done later. At present our

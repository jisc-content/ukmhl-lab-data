146 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. It is equally clear that the cell substance is the seat of most of the destructive processes which constitute vital action. The cell substance is irritable, and is endowed with the power of con- tractility. Cell fragments without nucleii are sensitive enough, and can move around as readily as normal cells. Moreover, the various fibres which surround the centrosomes in cell division and whose contractions and expansions, as we have seen, pull the chromosomes apart i" cell division, are parts of the cell substance. All o these are the results of destructive metaholism, and we must, therefore, conclude that destructive processes are seated in the cell substance. The centrosome is too problematical as yet tor much comment. It appears to he a piece of the machinery for bringing about cell division, but beyond this it is not safe to make any state- ™*ln brief, then, the cell body is a machine for carrving on destructive chemical changes, and liberating from the compounds thus broken to pieces their inclosed energy, which is at once converted into motion or heat or some other form of active energy. This chemical destruc- tion is, however, possible only after the compounds have become a part of the cell, therefore, possesses a nucleus . power of enabling it to assimilate its food-that 13, to convert it into its own substance, i nucleus further contains a marvellous material chromatin—which in some way exercises a con- Sg influence in its life and is handed down Lm one generation to another by continuous

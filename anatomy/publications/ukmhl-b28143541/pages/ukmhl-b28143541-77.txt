73 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. one of mechanical evolution. It is plain then that the question of whether we can attribute the properties of the simplest type of life to chemical composition or to mechanical structure is more than a formal one. thj: discovery of cells. It is difficult for us to-day to have any adequate idea of the wonderful flood of light that was thrown upon scientific and philo- sophical study by the discoveries which are grouped around the terms cells and proto- plasm. Cells and protoplasm have become so thoroughly a part of modern biology that we can hardly picture to ourselves the vagueness of knowledge before these facts were recognized. Perhaps a somewhat crude comparison will illus- trate the relation which the discovery of cells had to the study of life. Imagine for a moment, some intelligent being located on the moon and trying to study the phenomena on the earthâ€™s surface. Suppose that he is provided with a telescope sufficiently power- ful to disclose moderately large objects on the earth, but not smaller ones. He would see cities in various parts of the world with wide differ- ences in appearance, size, and shape. He would see railroad trains on the earth rushing to and fro. He would see new cities arising and old ones increasing in size, and we may imagine him speculating as to their method of origin and the reasons why they adopt this or that shape. But in spite of his most acute observations and his

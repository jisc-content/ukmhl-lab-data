206 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. parts. Whatever chemical forces may have accomplished, they never could have combined different bodies into linin, centrosomes, chromo- somes, etc., which, as we have seen, are the basis of cell life. To account for this machine, there- fore, we are driven to assume either that it was produced by some unknown intelligent power in its present condition of complex adjustment, or to assume that it has had a long history of build- ing by successive steps, just as we have seen to be the case with the higher organisms. The latter assumption is, of course, in harmony with the general trend of thought. To-day protoplasm is produced only from other protoplasm; but, plainly, the first protoplasm on the earth must have had a different origin. We must therefore next look for facts which will enable us to understand its origin. "We have seen that the animal and plant machines have been built up from the simple cell as the result of its powers acting under the ordi- nary conditions of nature. Now, in accordance with this general line of thought, we shall be compelled to assume that previous to the period of building machinery which we have been con- sidering, there was another period of machine building, during which this cell machine was built by certain natural forces. But here we are forced to stop, for nothing: which we yet know gives even a hint as to the; method by which this machine was produced. We have, however, seen that there are forces im nature efficient in building machines, as well as 5 those for producing chemical compounds; and I this, doubtless, suggests to us that there may be*

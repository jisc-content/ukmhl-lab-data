THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 131 From now the divisions of the egg follow rapidly by the normal process of cell division until from this one egg cell there are eventually derived hundreds of thousands of cells which are gradu- ally moulded into the adult. All of these cells will, of course, contain four chromosomes ^ and what is more important, half of the chromo- somes will have been derived directly from the male and half from the female parent. Even into adult life, therefore, the cells of the animal probably contain chromatin derived by direct descent from each of its parents. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FERTILIZATION. Frona this process of fertilization a number of conclusions, highly important for our purpose can be drawn. In the first place, it is evident that the chromosomes form the part of the cell which contain the hereditary traits handed down from parent to child. This follows from the fact that the chromosomes are the only part of the cell which, in the fertilized egg, is derived from both parents. Now the offspring can certainly inherit from each parent, and hence the hereditary traits must be associated with some part of the cell which is derived from both. But the egg substance is derived from the mother alone ^ the centrosome, at least in some cases and perhaps in all, is derived only from the father, while the chromosomes are derived from hath parents. Hence it follows that the hereditary traits must be particularly associated with the centrosomes.

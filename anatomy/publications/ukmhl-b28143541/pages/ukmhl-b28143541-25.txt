21 INTRODUCTION. 1 and adopted new methods. Even the problems which it tried to solve were radically changed. 1 Hitherto the attempt had been made to find in- stances of puiyose in nature. The marvellous adaptations of living beings to their conditions had long been felt, and the study of the purposes 1 of these adaptations had inspired many a mag- i nificent conception. But now the scientist lost sight of the purpose in hunting for the cause. Natural law is blind and can have no purpose. To the scientist, filled with the thought of the reign of law, purpose could not exist in nature. Only cause and effect appeal to him. The present 1 phenomena are the result of forces acting in the past, and the scientistâ€™s search should be not for the purpose of an adaptation, but for the action of the forces which produced it. To discover the forces and laws which led to the development of I the present forms of animals and plants, to ex- plain the method by which these forces of nature have acted to bring about present results, these became the objects of scientific research. It no 1 longer had any meaning to find that a special organ was adapted to its conditions ; but it was i necessary to find out how it became adapted. The difference in the attitude of these two points I of view is world-wide. The former fixes the - attention upon the end, the latter upon the means ; by which the end was attained; the former is ' what we sometimes call teleological, the latter i scientific; the former was the attitude of the study I of animals and plants before the middle of this i century, the latter the spirit which actuates I modern biology.

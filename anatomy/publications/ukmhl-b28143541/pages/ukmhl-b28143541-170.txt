166 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. iustified in this conclusion when we find that the relationships which we draw between the types of life now in existence run parallel to the history of these types as fossils, and at the same time disclosed by the study of embryology. • i This subject of comparative anatomy includes a consideration of what is called homology, and perhaps a concrete example may be instructive Lth in illustration and as suggesting the course which nature adopts in constructing her machines We speak of a monkey’s arm and a bird s wing as homologous, although they different in appearance and adapted to different duties. They are called homologous because they have similar parts in similar relations. This can be seen in Figs. 47 and 48, where it that each has the same bones, *J bird’s wing some of the bones have bep fused together !nd others lost. Jheir simi an y points to a relationship, but their dissimilari y tells us that the relationship is a distent one, and that their common point must have been quite far back in history. Now if we follow back the history of these two kinds of appendages, as shown to iis by fossils, we find them point. The arm can readily be traced to walking appendage, while the birds wing, by means of some interesting connecting p*®. ^n in a similar way be traced to an appendage with its five fingers all free and used for talking. Fig. 49 shows one of these connecting hnks re presenting the earliest type of bir , w ler

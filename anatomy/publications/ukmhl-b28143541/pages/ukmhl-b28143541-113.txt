THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 109 cell substance, and it goes through a series of activities which are entirely unrepresented in the surrounding protoplasm. It is some- thing entirely distinct, and its relations to the life of the cell are unique and marvellous. These various facts led to a period in the dis- cussion of biological topics which may not in- appropriately be called the Eeign of the Nucleus. Let us, therefore, see what this structure is which has demanded so much attention in the last twenty years. (b) Structure of the Nucleus.â€”At first the nucleus appears to be very much like the cell substance. Like the latter, it is made of fibres, which form a reticulum (Fig. 23), and these fibres, like those of protoplasm, have micro- somes in intimate relation with them and hold a clear liquid in their meshes. The meshes of the network are usually rather closer than in the outer cell substance, but their general character appears to be the same. But a more close study of the nucleus discloses vast differ- ences. In the first place, the nucleus is usually separated from the cell substance by a membrane (Fig. 23, c). This membrane is almost always present, but it may disappear, and usually does disappear, when the nucleus begins to divide. Within the nucleus we find commonly one or two smaller bodies, the nucleoli (Fig. 23, /). They appear to be distinct vital parts of the nucleus, and thus different from certain other solid bodies which are simply excreted material, and hence lifeless. Further, we find that the reticulum within the nucleus is made up of two very differ-

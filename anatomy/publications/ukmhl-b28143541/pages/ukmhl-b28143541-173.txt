THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS, 169 Each tells of its greater and greater differentia- fcion of labour and structure as the periods of time passed. Each tells of a growing complexity and an increasing perfection of the organisms as successive periods pass. Each tells us of common points of origin and divergence from these points, ^ach tells us how the more complicated forms have arisen as the results of changes in and modifications of the simpler forms. Each shows us how the individual parts of the organisms have been enlarged or diminished or changed in shape to adapt them to new duties. Each in s ort, tells the same story of the gradual con- struction of the living machine by slow steps and through long ages of time. When these three sources of history so accurately agree with each other, It IS as impossible to disbelieve in the existence of such history as it is to disbelieve in the existence of the ancient Hittite nation, after Its history has been told to us by two different sources of record. Now all this is very germane to our subject. We are trying to learn how this living machine, with Its wonderful capabilities, was built. The history which we have outlined is undoubtedly the history of the building of this machine, and the knowledge that these complicated machines have been produced as the result of slow growth is of the utmost importance to us. This know- ledge gives us at the very start some idea of the nature of the forces which have been at work. It tells us that in searching for these forces we must look for those which have been acting constantly. We must look for forces which pro^

164 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. lation of this history of the machine has teen of extreme value. Many a bit of obscurity has been cleared up when the embryology of puzzling animals has been studied. Many a •'elationship has been made clear, and this is simply another wav of saying that a portion of this history of life has beL read. This aid of embryology has been particularly valuable in just *at part of the history where the evidence from the study of fossils, is wanting. The study of fossils, we have seen, gives little or no data concermrio the early history of living machines; and it is just here that embryology has proved to be o the most value. It is a source of evMence that has told us of most of the steps in the progress from the single-celled animal to the organisms, and gives ns the clearest idea of the fundamental principles which have been con- cerned in the evolution of life and the construction of the complicated machine out of the simple bi of protoplasm. In spite of its limits, therefore, embryology has contributed a large quota of the evidence which we have of the evolution of life. ANATOMICAL. A third source of this history is obtained from the facts of comparative anatomy. The essential feature of this subject is the fact that animals and plants show relationships. This fact is one of Lst patent and yet one of the most facts rf biology. It has been recognized *e very beginning of the study of animals and plants. One cannot be even the most superhcial observer without seeing that certain forms show great

92 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. perties of living things—irritability, contracti- bility, assimilation, and reproduction. It was a compound which seemiogly deserved the name of “ physical basis of Ufef which was soon given to it by Huxley. With this conception of proto- plasm as the physical basis of life the problems connected with the study of life became more simplified. In order to study the nature of life it was no longer necessary to study the confusing mass of complex organs disclosed to us by animals and plants, or even the somewhat less confusing structures shown by individual cells. Even the simple cell has several separate parts cap- able of undergoing great modifications in different types of animals. This confusion now appeared to vanish, for only one thing was found to be alive, and that was apparently very simple. But that substance exhibited all the properties of life. It moved, it could grow, and reproduce itself, so that it was necessary only to explain this sub- stance and life would be explained. (b) Nature of Protoplasm. — What is this material, protoplasm ? As disclosed by the early microscope it appeared to he nothing more than a simple mass of jelly, usually transparent, more or less consistent, sometimes being quite fluid, and at others more solid. Structure it appeared to have none. Its chief peculiarity, so far as physical characters were concerned, was a won- derful and never-ceasing activity. This jelly- like material appeared to be endowed with wonderful powers, and yet neither physical nor microscopical study revealed at first anything more than a uniform homogeneous mass of jelly.

178 THE STORY OF LIFERS MECHANISM. Now whether this undifferentiated gm plasm, as we will now call it, is distributed al over the body or is collected at certain points is im- Srial to our purpose. It is certain that por- tions of it find their way into reproductive . oraans of the animal or plant. Thus we that nart of the chromatin material in the egg 0^ the first generation develops into the second generation, while another part of remains®dormant in that second go^« eventually becoming the chromatin of its e,,sS and spermatozoa. Thus each egg of the second a?S,' rwil““a?p: exactly like the second generation, since it con Sns chromosomes which are absolutely identicall wHh those from which the second generationi sprung There is thus no difficulty in “ndej- stonding why the second generation will be like, the firs®- and since the process is simply repeated.) again in tL next reproduction, the third generan tion will be like the second, and so on, generationi "generation. A study of the accompanyins; riiciarflm will iiiaks this clear. In other words, we have here a simple ^^der standing of at least some of the features of her t dity. This explanation is that ^^me of the ch^. matin material or germ plasm is handed dow from one generation to another, and is stom tempor^W i" ‘^e nucleii of the reproductivi

34 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. space with arrangements for furnishing hiin with air and food in measured quantity, and witti appliances for measuring accurately the work he does and the heat given off from his body. In addition, it is necessary to measure the exact amount of material he eliminates in the form oi carbonic acid and other excretions. Such ex- periments present many difficulties which have not yet been thoroughly overcome, but they have been attempted by several investigators. For the purpose of such an experiment scientists have allowed themselves to be shut up in a small chamber six or eight feet in length, in which their only communication with the outer world is by telephone and through a small opening in the side of the chamber, occasionally opened tor a second or two to supply the prisoner with food In such a chamber they have remained as long as twelve days. In these experiments it is necessary to take account not only ot the food eaten, but of the actual amount of this tood which is used by the body. If the person gams in weight, this must mean that he is storing up in his body material for future use ; while it he loses in weight, this means that he is consuming his own tisLes for fuel. Careful daily records of his weight must therefore be taken. Fstu mates of the solids, liquids, and gases given oft from his body must be obtained, for to carry out the experiment an exact balance must be made between the income and the outgo, ilie apparatus devised for such experiments has been made very delicate ; so delicate, incleed, that the rising of the individual in the box from his chair

THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 181 But plainly reproduction and heredity, as we have thus far cousidered them, will be unable to account for the slow modification of the machine • for in accordance with the facts thus far outlined’ each pneration would be precisely Wee the last, and there would be no chance for development nd .change from generation to generation. If the individual is simply the unfolding of the powers possessed by a bit of germ plasm, and if this geim plasm is simply handed on from pneration to generation, the successive genera- tions must of necessity be identical. But the living machine has been built by changes in the successive generation, and hence plainly some other factor is needed. This factor is mriatim. VARIATION. u‘tat produces moiifi- catwn of type. Heredity, as just explained, would make all generations alike. But nothing is more certain than that they are not alike. The fact 0 yariation is patent on every side, for no two fTiralike. _ Successive generations 1 er rom each other in one respect or another h. h' rof theiT bills or toes butterflies, in their colours; dogs, in their size and shape and markings; and so on through an endless category. Plants and animals alike throughout nature show variations in the greatest profusion. It is these variations which must urnish us with the foundation of the changes malne " "P

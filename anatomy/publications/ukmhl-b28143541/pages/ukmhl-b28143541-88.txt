In some ..- V-“T.:.!* - ■ - - animal tissues the formed material is still greater in amount. At Fig. 18, for example, is a bit of con- nective tissue, made up of a mass of fine fibres which have no resemblance to cells, and indeed are not cells. These fibres have, however, been made by cells, and a care- ful study of such tissue at proper places will show the cells within it. The cells shown in Fig. 18 (c) have secreted the fib- rous material. Fig. 19 shows a cell composing a bit of nerve. At Fig. 20 is a bit of muscle ; the only trace of cellular structure that it shows is in the nuclei (n), but if the muscle be studied in a young condition its cellular structure is more ^ i i. evident. Thus it happens in adult animals that the cells which are large and clear at first, be- come less and less evident, until the adult tissue Fig. 17.—a bit cf bone, showing the cells embedded in the bony matter.

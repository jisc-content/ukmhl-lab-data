THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 165 likeness to each other while others are much more unlike. The grouping of animals and plants into orders, genera, and species is dependent upon this relationship. If two forms are alike in everything except some slight detail, they are commonly placed in the same genus hut in differ- ent species, while if they show a greater unlike- ness they may be placed in separate genera. By thus grouping together forms according to their resemblance, the animal and vegetable kingdoms ^e classified into groups subordinate to groups. The principle of relationship, i.e., fundamental similarity of structure, runs through the whole animal and vegetable kingdom. Even the ani- inals most unlike each other show certain points of similarity which indicates a relationship, al- though of course a distant one. The fact of such a relationship is too patent to demand more words, but its significance needs to be pointed out. When we speak of relationship aniong men, we always mean his- torical connection. Two brothers are closely related because they have sprung from common parents, while two cousins are less closely re- lated because their common point of origin was farther back in time. More widely we speak of the relationship of the Indo-European races meaning thereby that back in the history of man these races had a common point of origin We never speak of any real relation of objects unless thereby we mean to imply historical con- nection. We are therefore justified in inter- preting the manifest relationships of organisms as pointing to history. Particularly are we

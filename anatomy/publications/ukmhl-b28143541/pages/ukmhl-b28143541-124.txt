i20 THE STORY OF LIFERS MECHANISM. the spindle fibres bear a partâ€”a fact which again points to the importance of the centro- somes and the forces which radiate from them. Now the chromosomes in each daughter nucleus unite to form a single thread, or may diffuse through the nucleus to form a network, as in Fig. 32. They now become surrounded by a membrane, so that the new nucleus appears exactly like the original one. The spindle fibres disappear, and the astral fibres may either dis- appear or remain visible. The centrosome may apparently in some cases disappear, but more commonly remains beside the daughter nucleii, or it may move into the nucleus. Eventually it divides into two, the division commonly occur- ring at once (Fig. 32), but sometimes not until the next cell division is about to begin. Thus the final result shows two cells each with a nucleus and two centrosomes, and this is exactly the same sort of structure with which the process began. Viewed as a whole, we may make the follow- ing general summary of this process. The essen- tial object of this complicated phenomena of karyoJcinesis is to divide the chromatin into equivalent halves, so that the cells resulting from the cell division shall contain an exactly equiva- lent chromatin content. For this purpose the chromatic elements collect into threads and split lengthwise. The centrosome, with its fibres, brings about the separation of these two halves. Plainly, we must conclude that the chromatin material is something of extraordinary import- ance to the cell, and the centrosome is a bit of

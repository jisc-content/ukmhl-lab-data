12 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. inexplicable. To explain them many a sublime conception of almighty power had arisen, and the study of the heavenly bodies ever gave rise to the highest thoughts of Deity. But Newton’s law of gravitation reduced the whole to'the greatest simplicity. Through the law and force of gravi- tation these mysteries were brought within the grasp of human understanding. They ceased to be looked upon.longer as supernatural, and became natural phenomena so soon as the force of gravi- tation was accepted as a part of nature. In other branches of natural phenomena the same history followed. The forces and laws of chemical affinity were formulated and studied, and physical laws and forces were comprehended. As these natural forces were grasped it became, little by little, evident that the various pheno- mena of nature were simply the result of nature’s forces acting in accordance with nature’s laws. Phenomena hitherto mysterious were one after another brought within the realm of law, and as this occurred a smaller and smaller portion of them were left within the realm of the so-called supernatural. By the middle of this century this advance had reached a point where scientists, at least, were ready to believe that nature’s forces were all-powerful to account for nature’s phe- nomena. Science had passed from the reign of mysticism to the reign of law. But after chemistry and physics, with all the forces that they could muster, had exhausted their powers in explaining natural phenomena, there apparently remained one class of facts which was still left in the realm of the supernatural

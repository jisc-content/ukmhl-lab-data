112 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. or coiled (Fig. 26) ; while in other cells the chromatin thread is an extremely long, very much twisted convolute thread so complexly woven into a tangle as to give the appearance of a minute network. The nuclei! differ also in the number of nucleoli they contain as well as in other less important particulars. Fig. 26 will give a little notion of the variety to be found among different nuclei! ; but although they thus do vary most remarkably in shape in the essential parts of their structure they are alike. CENTROSOME. Before noticing the activities of the nucleus it will be necessary to mention a third part of the cell. Within the last few years there has been found to be present in most cells an organ which has been called the centrosome. This body is shown at Fig. 23, g. It is found in the cell substance just outside the nucleus, and com- monly appears as an extremely minute rounded dot, so minute that no internal structure has been discerned. It may be no larger than the minute granules or microsomes in the cell, and until recently it entiiely escaped the notice of micro- scopists. It has now, however, been clearly demonstrated as an active part of the cell and entirely distinct from the ordinary microsomes. It stains differently, and, as we shall soon see, it appears to be in most intimate connection with the centre of cell life. In the activities which characterize cell life this centrosome appears to lead the way. From it radiate the forces which

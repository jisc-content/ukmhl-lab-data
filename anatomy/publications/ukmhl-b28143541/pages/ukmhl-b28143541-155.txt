THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 151 a machine, and its parts are separate machines. Each part is further made up of still smaller machines until we reach the realm of the micro- scope. Here still we find the same story. Even the parts formerly called units prove to be machines, and when we recognize the complexity of these cells and their marvellous activities, we are ready to believe that we may find still further machines within. And thus vital activity is reduced to a complex of machines, all acting in harmony with each other to produce together the one resultâ€”life.

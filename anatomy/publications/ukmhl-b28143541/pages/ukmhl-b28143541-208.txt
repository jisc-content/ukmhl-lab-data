204 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. really exist in living protoplasm, while the mar- vellous activities described are found only in the highly organized cell, but do not belong to simple protoplasm. It is claimed that simple protoplasm consists of a physical mixture of two different compounds, which form a foam when thus mixed, and that much of the described structure of proto- plasm is only the appearance of this foam. This conception is certainly not the prevalent one to-day; and even if it should be the proper one, it would still leave the cell as an extremely com- plicated machine. Under any view the cell is a mechanism, and must be resolved into subordi- nate parts. It may be uncertain whether these subordinate parts are to be regarded simply as chemical compounds physically mixed, or as smaller units, each of which is a smaller mechan- ism. At all events, at the present time we know of no such simple protoplasm capable of living activities apart from machinery, and the problem of explaining life, even in the simplest form known, remains the problem of explaining a mechanism. THE ORIGIN OF THE CELL MACHINE. We have thus set before us another problem, which is after all the fundamental one, namely, to ask whether we can tell anything of nature’s method of building the protoplasmic machine. The building of the higher animal and plant, as we have seen, is the result of the powers of protoplasm; but protoplasm itself is a machine. What has been its history 1

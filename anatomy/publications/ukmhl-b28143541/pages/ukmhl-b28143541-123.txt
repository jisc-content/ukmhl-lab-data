THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 11^ of the thread by splitting will give rise to a double series of threads, each of which has identical characters. Should the division occur across the thread the two halves would be unlike, but taking place as it does by a longitudinal splitting, each unit in the thread simply divides in half, and thus the resulting half threads each contain the same number of similar units as the other and the same as possessed by the original undivided chromosome. This sort of splitting thus doubles the number of chromo- somes, but produces no differentiation of material. The next step in the cell division consists in the separation of the two halves of the chromo- somes. Each half of each chromosome separates from its fellow, and moves to the opposite end of the nucleus towards the two centrosomes (Fig. 31). Whether they are pulled apart or pushed apart by the spindle fibres is not certain, although it is apparently sure that these fibres from the centrosomes are engaged in the matter. Certain it is that some force exerted from the two centro- somes acts upon the chromosomes, and forces the two halves of each one to opposite ends of the nucleus, where they now collect and form two new nucleii, with evidently exactly the same number of chromosomes as the original, and with characters identical to each other and to the original (Fig. 32). The rest of the cell division now follows rapidly. A partition grows in through the cell body dividing it into two parts (Fig. 32), the division passing through the middle of the spindle. In this division, in some cases at least,

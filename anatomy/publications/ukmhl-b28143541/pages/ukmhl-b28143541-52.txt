48 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. details of this matter we need not go, but this will be sufficient to indicate that the whole pro- cess is a mechanical one. We must not fail to see, however, that in this problem of circulation there are two points at least where once more we meet with that class of phenomena which we still call vital. The beating of the heart is the first of these, for this is active muscular power. The second is a contraction of the smaller blood-vessels which regulates the blood supply. Both of these phenomena are phases of muscular activity, and will be included under the discussion of other similar phenomena later. We next notice that not only is the distribu- tion of the blood explained upon mechanical principles, but the supplying of the active parts of the body with food is in the same way intelli- gible. As we have seen, the blood coming from the intestine contains the food material received from the digested food. Now when this blood in its circulation flows through the active tissues —for instance, the muscles—it is again placed under conditions where osmosis is sure to occur. In the muscles the thin-walled blood-vessels are surrounded and bathed by a liquid called lymph. Figure 6 shows a bit of muscle tissue, with its blood-vessels, which are surrounded by lymph. The lymph, which is not shown. Alls all the space outside the blood-vessels, thus bathing both muscles and blood-vessels. Here again we have a membrane {i.e,. the wall of the blood-vessel) separating two liquids, and since the lymph is ot a different composition from the blood, dialysis between them is sure to occur, and the materials

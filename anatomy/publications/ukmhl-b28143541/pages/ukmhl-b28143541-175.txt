THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 171 events, we have learned in the last forty years to recognize some of the factors which have been at work in the construction of this machine. We must turn, therefore, to the consideration of these factors. FORCES AT WORK IN THE BUILDING OF THE LIVING MACHINE. There are three primary factors which lie at the bottom of the whole process. They areâ€” 1. MeproducUon, which preserves type from generation to generation. 2. Vai'iation, which modifies type from genera- tion to generation. 3. Heredity, which transmits characters from generation to generation. Each must be considered by itself. REPRODUCTION. Eeproduction is the primary factor in this process of machine building, heredity and varia- tion being simply phases of reproduction. The living machine has developed by natural pro- cesses, all other machines by artificial methods. Reproduction is the one essential point of differ- ence between the living machine and the others which has made their construction by natural processes a possibility. What, then, is repro- duction?^ Reproduction is in all cases at the bottom simple division. Whether we consider the plant that multiplies by buds or the uni- cellular animal that simply divides into two equal parts, or the larger animal that multi-

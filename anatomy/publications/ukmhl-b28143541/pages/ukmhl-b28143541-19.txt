INTRODUCTION. 15 required many years to discover the key to the record. But under the influence of the writings of Lyell, just before the middle of the century, it ■ began to appear that the key to this language is to be found by simply opening the eyes and observing what is going on around us to-day. A more extraordinary and more important dis- I covery has hardly ever been made, for it con- tained the foundation of nearly all scientific discoveries which have been made since. This : discovery proclaimed that an application of the : forces still at work to-day on the earth’s surface, I but continued throughout long ages, will furnish . the interpretation of the history written in the I rocks, and thus an explanation of the history of the earth itself. The slow elevation of the i earth’s crust, such as is still going on to-day, would, if continued, produce mountains ; and the washing away of the land by rains and floods, such as we see all around us, would, if continued through the long centuries, produce the valleys and gorges which so astound us. The explanation of the past is to be found in the present. But this geological history told of a history of life as well as a history of rocks. The history of the rocks has indeed been bound up in the history of life, and no sooner did it appear that the earth’s crust has had a readable history than it appeared that living nature had a parallel history. If the present is a key to the past in interpreting geo- logical history, should not the same be true of this history of life h It was inevitable that pro- blems of life should come to the front, and that the study of life from the dynamical standpoint.

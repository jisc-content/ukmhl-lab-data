THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 141 the leading advocates of the cell doctrine, and have beyond question been the inspiration of the development of that doctrine. But certainly no such conception of the signi- ficance of cell structure would longer be held. In spite of the fact that the egg is a single cell, it is impossible to avoid the belief that in some way it contains the starfish. W^e need not, of course, think of it as containing the structure of a star- fish, but we are forced to conclude that in some way its structure is such that it contains the starfish potentially.^ The relation of its parts and the forces therein are such that, when placed under proper conditions, it develops into a star- fish. Another egg placed under identical condi- tions will develop into a sea urchin, and another into an oyster. If these three eggs have the power of developing into three different animals under identical conditions, it is evident that they, must have corresponding differences in spite of the fact that each is a single cell. Each must in some way contain its corresponding adult. In other words, the organization must be within the cells, ^ and hence not simply produced by the associations of cells. Over this subject there has been a deal of puzzling and not a little experimentation. The presence of some sort of organization in the egg is clear but what is meant by the statement is not quite so clear. Is this adult organization in the whole egg or only in its nucleus, and especi- ally in the chromosomes which, as we have seen, contain the hereditary traits t When the egg begins to divide does each of the first two cells

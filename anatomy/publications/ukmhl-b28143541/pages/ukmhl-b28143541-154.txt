150 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. system are, in a measure, capable of compre- hension within a mechanical formula, leaving out of account the purely mental phenomena, which certainly have not been touched by the investi- gation. All of these phenomena are reducible to a few simple fundamental activities, and these fundamental activities we find manifested by simple bits of living matter unincumbered by the complicated machinery of organisms. With the few fundamental properties of these bits ot organic matter we can construct the complicated life of the higher organism. When we come, however, to study these simple bits of matter, they prove to be anything but simple of matter. They, too, are pieces of complicated mechanism whose action we do not even hope to understand. That their action is dependent upon their machinery is evident enough froin the simple description of cell activity which we have noticed. That these fundamental vital properties are to be explained as the result of chemical and mechanical forces acting through this machinery, cannot be doubted. But how this occurs or what constitutes the guiding force which corresponds to the engineer of the machine, we do not know. Thus our mechanical explanation of the living machine lacks a foundation. We can understand tolerably well tlie building of the superstruc- ture, but tbe foundation stones u^pon which that structure is built are unintelligible to us. ihe running of the living machine is thus only in part understood. The living organism is a machine, or, it is better to say, it is a series of machines one within the other. As a whole it is

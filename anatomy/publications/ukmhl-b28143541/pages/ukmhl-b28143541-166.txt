162 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. This fossil record has given us our best know ledge of the course by which the present living world has been brought into its existing condi- tion. But its accuracy is largely confined to the recent periods. Of the very early history fossils tell us little or nothing. All the early rocks, which we may believe were formed dping the period when the first steps in this machine bmld- ing were taken, have been so changed by heat and pressure that whatever specimens they may have originally contained have been crushed out pf shape. Furthermore, the earliest organisms had no hard skeletons, and it was not until hvmg beings had developed far enough to have hard parts that it was possible for them to leave traces of themselves in the rocks. Hence, so far as con- cerns this earliest history, we can get no record of it in the rocks. EMBRYOLOGIC AL. But here comes in another source of evidence which helps to fill up the gap. In its develop- ment every animal to-day begins as an egg. This is a simple cell, and the animal goes through a series of changes which eventually lead to the adult. Now these changes appear for the most part to be parallel to the changes through which the earlier forms of life passed in their development from the simple to the more compli- Ited forms. Where it is possible to follow the | history of the groups of animals from their fossil 1 rSs and cfmpa're it with the history of the individual animal as it progresses from the egg to the adult, there is found a very decrded parallel

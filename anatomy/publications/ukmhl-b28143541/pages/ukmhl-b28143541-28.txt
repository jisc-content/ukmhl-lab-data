24 THE STOilY OF LIFERS MECHANISM. composition, and that the more complex the compound the more varied its properties. It was a natural conception, therefore, that proto- plasm was a complex chemical compound, and that its vital properties were simply the chemical properties resulting from its composition. Just as water possesses the power of becoming solid at certain temperatures, so protoplasm possesses the power of assimilating food and growing ; and, since we do not doubt that the properties of water are the result of its chemical composition, so we may also assume that the vital properties of protoplasm are the result of its chemical com- position. It followed from this conclusion that if chemists ever succeeded in manufacturing the chemical compound, protoplasm, it would be alive. Vital phenomena were thus reduced to chemical and mechanical problems. These ideas arose shortly after the middle of the century, and have dominated the development of biological science up to the present time. It is evident that the aim of biological study must be to test these conceptions and carry them out into details. The chemical and mechanical la^ys of nature must be applied to vital phenomena in order to see whether they can furnish a satisfac- tory explanation of life. Are the laws and forces of chemistry sufficient to explain digestion 'i Are the laws of electricity applicable to an under- standing of nervous phenomena ? Are physical and chemical forces together sufficient to explain life 1 Can the animal body be properly regarded as a machine controlled by mechanical laws ? Or, on the other hand, are there some phases of life

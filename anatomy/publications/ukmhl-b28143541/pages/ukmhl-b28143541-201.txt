THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 197 they can have no permanent effect. We have heie thus again the problem of the inheritance of acquired characters. AVe have already noticed the uncertainty surrounding this subject, but the almost universal belief in the inheritance of such characters requires us to refer to it again. It is uncertain whether such direct effects have any in- fluence upon the offspring, and therefore whether they have anything to do with this machine build- ing. Still, there are many facts which point strongly in this direction. For example, as we study the history of the horse family we find that an originally five- toed animal began to walk inore and more on its middle toe, in such a way that this toe received more and more use, while the outer toes were used less and less. Now that such_ a habit would produce an effect upon the toes m any generation is evident; but apparently this influence extended from generation to gen- eration, for, as the history of the animals is followed. It IS found that the outer toes became smaller and smaller with the lapse of ages, while the middle one became correspondingly larger until there was finally produced the horse with its one toe only on each foot. Now here is a line oi descent or machine building in the direct line 01 the effects of use and disuse, and it seems very natural to suppose that the modification has been produced by the direct effect of the use of the organs. There are many other similar instances where the line of machine building has been quite parallel to the effects of use and disuse. If there- fore, acquired characters can be inherited â€™to any extent, we have, in the direct influences of the

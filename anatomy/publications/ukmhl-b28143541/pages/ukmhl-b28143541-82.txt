78 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. four, and by repeated divisions of this kind there arises a solid mass of smaller cells (Fig. 8, h to /), called the mulberry stage, from its resemblance to a berry. This is, of course, simply a mass of ! cells, each derived by division from the original. As the cells increase in number, the mass also increases in size by the absorption of nutriment, and the cells continue dividing until the mass • contains thousands of cells. Meantime the body Fig. 8.—Successive stages in the division of the developing egg. of the animal is formed out of these cells, and when it is adult it consists of millions of cells, all of which have been derived by division from the original cell. In such a history each cell comes from pre-existing cells and a cytoblastema plays no part. It was impossible, however, for Barry or any other person to follow the successive divisions of the egg cell through all the stages to the adult. The divisions can be followed for a short time under the microscope, but the rest must be a

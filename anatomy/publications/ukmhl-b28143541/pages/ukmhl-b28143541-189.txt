THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 185 minal substance. Indeed, it is not easy to see how any external conditions can have influence upon this germinal material if it is not an active part of the body, but is simply stored within it for future use in reproduction. How could any changes in the environment of the individual have any eflect upon this dormant material stored within it ? But if we are correct in regarding this germ material in the reproductive bodies as the basis of heredity and the guiding force in developrnent, then it follows that the only way in which congenital variations can occur is by some variations in the germ plasm. If^ a child developed from germ plasm identical with that from which its parents developed, it would inherit identical characters; and if there are any congenital variations from its parents, they must be due to some variations in the germ plasm. In other words, in order to explain con- genital variations we must account for variations in the germ plasm. Now, there are two methods by which we may suppose that these variations in the germ may arise. The first is by the direct influence upon the germ plasm of certain unknown external conditions. The life substance of organisms is always very unstable, and, as we have seen, acquired variations are caused by external in- fluences directly affecting it. Now, the heredi- tary material is also life substance, and it is plainly a possibility for us to imagine that this germ material is also subject to influences from the conditions surrounding it. That such varia- tions do occur appears to be hardly doubtful.

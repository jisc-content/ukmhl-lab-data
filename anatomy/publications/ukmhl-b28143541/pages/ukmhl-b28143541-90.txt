86 THE STORY OF LIFE'S MECHANISM. n.~— ■ rt per ties we are only concerned in the cell sub- stance, the formed material having nothing to do with fundamental activities of life, although it forms largely the secondary ma- chinery which we have already studied. In all higher animals and plants the life of the in- dividual begins as a single ovum or a single cell, and as it grows the cells in- crease rapidly until the F,=. f^ult is formed Out of The nuclei! are shown hundreds 01 millions 01 cells. As these cells become numerous they cease, after a little, to be alihe. They assume different shapes which are adapted to the different duties they are to perform. Thus, those cells which are to form bone soon become different from those which are to form muscle, and those which are to form the blood are quite unlike those which are to produce the hairs. By means of such a differentiation there arises a very complex mass of cells, with great variety in shape and function. It should be noticed further that there are some animals and plants in which the whole animal is composed of a single cell. These organisms are usually of extremely minute size, and they comprise most of the so-called animalculae which are found in Avater. In such animals the different parts of the cell are modi-

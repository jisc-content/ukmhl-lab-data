121 the cell and protoplasm. machinery for controlling its division and thus regulating cell division. fertilization of the egg. ^ This description of cell division will certainly give some idea of the complexity of cell life, but a more marvellous series of changes still takes place during the time when the 6gg is preparing for development. Inasmuch as this process still further illustrates the nature of the cell, and has further a most intimate bearing upon the funda- mental problem'of heredity, it will be necessary for us to consider it here briefly. The sexual reproduction of the many-celled animals is always essentially alike. A single one of the body cells is set apart to start the next generation, and this cell, after separating from the body of the animal or plant which produced it, begins to divide, as already shown in Tig. 8, and the many cells which arise from it eventually form the new individual. This reproductive cell IS the egg. ^ But before its division can begin there occurs in all cases of sexual reproduction a process called fertilization, the essential feature of which is the union of this cell with another commonly from a different individual. While the phenomenon is subject to considerable differ- ence in details, it is essentially as follows : The female reproductive cell is called the ess and it is this cell which divides to form the next generation. Such a cell is shown in Fig 33 Like other cells it has a cell wall, a cellâ€™sub- stance with its linin and fluid portions, a nucleus

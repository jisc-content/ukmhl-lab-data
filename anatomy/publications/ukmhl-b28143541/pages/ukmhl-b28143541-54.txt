50 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. it is not indeed in actual contact with the air, hut is separated from it by only a very thin membrane-so thin that it forms no hindrance to the interchange of gases. These air-cells are kept filled with air by simple muscular action. By the contraction of the muscles of the thorax the thoracic cavity is enlarged, and as a result air is sucked in in exactly the same way that it is sucked into a pair of bellows when expanded. Then the contraction of another set of i^^ascles decreases the size of the thoracic cavity, and the air is squeezed out again. The action is just ^ truly mechanical as is that of the blacksmiths The relation of the air to the blood is ]ust as simple. In the blood there are various chemical ingredients, among which is one known as haemo- globin. It does not concern us at present to ask where this material comes from, since this question is part of the broader question, the origin of the machine, to be discussed in the seclnd part of this work The hsemoglobin is a normal constituent of the blood, and, red in colour, gives the red colour to the blood. This hiemoglobin has peculiar relations to oxygen. It can be separated from the blood and experi- mented upon by the chemist in his lal^oratory It is found that when haemoglobin is broUj,ht in contact with oxygen, under sufficient pressure it will form a chemical union with it. ims chemical union is, however, what the chemist calls a loose combination, since it is readily broken up. If the oxygen is above a certain rather low pressure, the union will take place,

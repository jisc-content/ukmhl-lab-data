114 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. CELL DIVISION OR KARYOKINESIS. We will begin with a cell in what is called the resting stage, shown at Fig. 23. Such a cell has a nucleus, with its chromatin, its membrane, and linin, as already described. Outside the nucleus is the centrosome, or, more commonly, two ot them lying close together. If there is only one it soon divides into two, and if it has already two, this is because a single centrosome which the cell originally possessed has already divided into two, as we shall presently see. This cell, in short, is precisely like the typical cell which we have described, except in the possession of two centrosomes. The first indication of the cell division is shown by the chromatin fibres. During the resting stage this matin material may have the form of a thread, or may form a network of fibres (see rig. 27]. But whatever be its form during the resting stage, it assumes the form of a thread as the cel prepares for division. Almost at once this thread breaks into a number of pieces known as chromo- somes (Fig. 28). It is an extremely important fact that the number of these chromosomes in the ordinary cells of any animal or plant is always the same. In other words, in all the cells of the body of animal or plant the chromatin material in the nucleus breaks into the same number ot short threads at the time that the cell is prepaiing to divide. The number is the same for all animals of the same species, and is never departed from. For example, the number in the ox is always sixteen, while the number in the lily is always

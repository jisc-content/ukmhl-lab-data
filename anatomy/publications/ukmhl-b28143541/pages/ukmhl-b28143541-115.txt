THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. HI relative to the size of the cell; sometimes especially in young cells—the nucleus being very large, while in other cases the nucleus is very small and the protoplasmic contents of the cell very large; finally, in cells which have lost their activity the nucleus may almost or entirely disappear. They difTer, secondly, in shape. The typical form appears to be spherical or nearly 80; but from this typical form they may vary. Fiq. 26.—Different forms of nucleil. becoming irregular or elongated. They are some- tinies drawn out into long masses looking like a string of beads (Fig. 24), or, again, resembling minute coiled worms (Fig. 21), while in still other cells they may be branching like the twigs of a tree. The form and shape of the chromatin thread differs widely. Sometimes this appears to be mere reticulum (Fig. 23) • at others, a short thread which is somewhat twisted

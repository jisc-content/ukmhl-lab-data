THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 189 how influences surrounding an animal may affect its organs. The increase in the size of the muscles of the blacksmithâ€™s arm by use we under- stand readily enough. But with our understand- ing of the machinery of heredity we can not see how such an effect can extend to the next gen- eration. It is only the organ directly affected that is modified by external conditions. Ac- quired variations will appear in the part of the body influenced by the changed conditions. But the germ plasm within the reproductive glands is not, so far as we can see, subject to the influ- ence of an increased use, for example, in the arm muscles. The germ material is derived from the parents, and, if it is simply stored in the indivi- dual, how could an acquired variation affect it ? If an individual lose a limb, his offspring will not be without a corresponding limb, for the hereditary material is in the reproductive organs, and it is impossible to believe that the loss of the limb can remove from the hereditary material in the repro- ductive glands just that part of the germ plasm which was designed for the production of the limb. So,^ too, if the germ plasm is simply stored in the individual, it is impossible to conceive any way that it can be affected by the conditions around the individual in such a way as to ex- plain the inheritance of acquired variations. If acquired variations do not affect the germ plasm they cannot be inherited, and if the germ plasm is only a bit of protoplasmic substance handed down from generation to generation, we can not believe that acquired variations can influence it. From such considerations as these have arisen

134 THE STORY OE LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. earlier notion of protoplasm as the physical basis of life. There can be no life without the pro- perties of assimilation, growth, and reproduction; and, so far as we know, these properties are found only in that combination of bodies which we call the cell, with its mixture of harmoniously acting parts. Life, at least the life of a (^ll, is then not the p'operty of a chemical compound proto- plasm, hut is the result of the activities of a machine. Indeed, we are now at a loss to know how we can retain the term protoplasm. As originally used it meant the contents of the cell, and the significance in the term was in the conception of protoplasm as a somewhat homogeneous chemical compound uniform in all types of life.^ But we now see that this cell contains not a single substance, but a large number, including solids, jelly masses, and liquids, each of which has its own chemical composition. The number of chemical com- pounds existing in the material formerly call^ed protoplasm no one knows, but we do know that they are many, and that the different substances are combined to form a physical structure. Which of these various bodies shall we continue to call protoplasm ? Shall it be the linin, or the liquids, or the microsomes, or the chromatin threads, or the centrosomes 1 Which of these is the actual physical basis of life 1 From the de- scription of cell life which we have given, it will be evident that no one of them is a material upon which our chemical biologists can longer found a chemical theory of life. That chemical theory ot life, as we have seen, was founded upon the con- ception that the primitive life substance is a

129 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. form the female nucleus (Fig. 40,Â». The chro- matin material, in both the male and female pronucleus, soon breaks up into a network in which It IS no longer possible to see that each contains two chromosomes (Fig. 41). Now the centrosome, which is beside the male pronucleus shows signs of activity. It becomes surrounded hy prominent rays to form an aster (Fig. 41 ce) and then it begins to move toward the female pronucleus, apparently dragging the male pro- nucleus after it. In this way the centrosome approaches the female pronucleus, and thus tinally the two nuclei! are brought into close proximity. Meantime the chromatin material in each has once more broken up into short threads or chromosomes, and once more we find that each ot the nucleii contains two of these bodies (Fig. 42) In the subsequent figures the chromosomes of the male nucleus are lightly shaded, while those of the female are black in order to dis- tinguish them. As these two nucleii finally come together their membranes disappear, and the chromatic material comes to lie freely in the egg, the male and female chromosomes, side by side, but distinct forming the segmentation nucleus The egg plainly now contains once number of chromosomes normal for the cells of the animal, but half of them have been erived from each parent. It is very suggestive ? ^nd further that the chromosomes in this fertilized egg do not fuse with each other but remain quite distinct, so that it can be seen that the new nucleus contains chromosomes derived from each parent (Fig. 42). Nor does

202 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. variation, and heredity are the properties of all living matter j but they are not, like gravity and chemism, universal forces of nature. They occur in living organisms only. Why should they occur in living organisms, and here alone 'i These three properties are perhaps the most marvellous properties of nature; and surely we have not finished our task if we have based the whole pro- cess of machine building upon these mysterious phenomena, leaving them unintelligible. We must therefore now ask whether we can proceed any farther and find any explanation of these funda- mental powers of the living machine. It must be confessed that here we are at present forced to stop. We can proceed no further with any certainty, or even probability. We may say that variation and heredity are only phases of re- production, and reproduction is a property of the i living cell. W^e may say that this power of re- production is dependent upon the power of assi- milation and growth, for cell division is a result, of cell growth. We may further say that growth i and assimilation are chemical processes resulting: from the oxidation of food, and that thus all oft these processes are to be reduced to chemical I forces. In this way we may seem to have ai chemical foundation for life phenomena. Butt clearly this is far from satisfactory. In the^ firstt place, it utterly fails to explain why the living; cell has these properties, while no other body pos- sesses them, nor why they are possessed by living; protoplasms alone, ceasing instantly with death.. Indeed, it does not tell us what death can be.. Secondly, it utterly fails to explain the marvels?

THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 155 machine building is different. Every step in the process, so far as we can trace it at least, has produced a complete machine. So far back as we can follow this history we find that at every point the machine was so complete as to be always endowed with motion and life activity. Nature s method has been to take simpler types of machines and slowly change them into more complicated ones without at any moment impair- ing their vigour. It is something as if the steam engine of Watt should be slowly changed by add- ing piece after piece until there was finally pro- duced the modern quadruple expansion engine, but all this change being made upon the original engine without once stopping its motion. This gradual construction of the living ma- chines has been called Organic Evolution, or the Theory of Descent, It will be necessary for us, in order to comprehend the problem which we have before us, to briefly outline the course of this evolution. Our starting point in this history must be the cell, for such is the earliest and simplest form of living thing of which we have any trace. This cell is,, of course, already a machine, and we must presently return to the problem of its origin. At present we will assume this cell as a starting point endowed with its fundamental vital powers. It was sensitive, it could feel, grow, and reproduce itself. From such a simple machine, thus endowed, the his- tory has been something as follows: In repro- ducing itself this machine, as we have already seen, simply divided itself into two halves, each like the other. At first all the parts thus arising

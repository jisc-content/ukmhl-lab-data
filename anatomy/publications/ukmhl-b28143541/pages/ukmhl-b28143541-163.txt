THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 159 the history of these machines began as a simple mass of cells, there was a possibility of an almost endless variety of methods of organization. But as a distinct type of organization was adopted by one and another line of descendants all subse- quent productions were limited through the law A general line of organization adopted by their ancestors. With each age the further growth of such machines must consist in the further development in the perfection of its parts, and not in the adoption of any new system of organization. _ Hence it is that the history of the living machine has shown a tendency toward development along a few well-marked lines, and although this complication becomes greater, we still see the same fundamental scheme of organi- zation running through the whole. As the ages have progressed the machines have become more perfect in the adjustment of their parts, i.e. they have become more perfect machines, but the his- tory has been simply that of perfecting the early machines rather than the production of new types. EVIDENCE FOR THIS HISTORY. As just outlined, we see that the living machines have been gradually brought into t^heir present condition by a process which has been called organic evolution. But we must pause for a moment to ask what is our evidence that such has been the history of the livin- machine. The whole possibility of understand- nature depends upon our accepting this history and finding an explanation bf it

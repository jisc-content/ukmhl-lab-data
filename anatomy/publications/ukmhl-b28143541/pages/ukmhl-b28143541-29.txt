25 INTRODUCTION. which the forces of chemistry and physics cannot account for ? Are there limits to the application of natural law to explain life ? Can there be found something connected with living beings which is force but not correlated with the ordinary forms of energy 1 Is there such a thing as vital energy, or is the so-called vital force simply a name which we have given to the peculiar mani- festations of ordinary energy as shown in the substance protoplasm ? These are some of the questions that modern biology is trying to answer, and it is the existence of such questions which has made modern biology a new science. Such questions not only did not, but could not, have arisen before the doctrines of the conser- vation of energy and evolution had made their impression upon the thought of the world. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEW BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. It is further evident that the answers to these questions will have a significance reaching beyond the domain of biology proper and affecting the fundamental philosophy of nature. The answer will determine whether or not w^e can accept in entirety the doctrines of the conservation of energy and evolution. Plainly if it should be found that the energy of animate nature was not correlated with other forms of energy, this would demand either a rejection or a complete modifi- cation of our doctrine of the conservation of energy. If an animal can create any energy within itself, or can destroy any energy, we can no longer regard the amount of energy of the

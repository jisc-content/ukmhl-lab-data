124 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. the last generation, since the division of the egg in development is like that already described, and always results in producing new cells with the same number of chromosomes as the starting cell. Hence, if the number of chromosomes in the next generation is to be kept equal to that in the last generation, this egg cell must get^ rid of a part of its chromatin material. This is done by a process shown in Fig. 35. ^ The^centrosome divides as in ordinary cell division (big. 35), and after rotating on its axis it approaches the surface Fig. 36. jmg. ok The ecg centrosomes have changed their position. The maie cell with its centrosome remains inactive until the stage Fig.*It!—B^g^lnn?ng‘o/t^ first division for removing superfluous chromosomes. of the egg (Figs. 36 and 37). The egg now divides (Fig. 38), but the division is of a peculiar kind. Although the chromosomes divide equally the e<^g itself d'ivides into two very unequal parts, one part still appearing as the egg and the as a minute protuberance called the polar cell (pc in Fi". 38). The chromosomes do not split as they do in the cell division already described,

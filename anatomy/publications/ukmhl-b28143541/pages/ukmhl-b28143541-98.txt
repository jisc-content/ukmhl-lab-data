94 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. and nitrogen, and closely related to ordinary pro- teids. This substance was the basis of living activ- ity, and to its modification under different condi- tions were due the miscellaneous phenomena of life. (c) Significance of Protoplasm.—The philosophi- cal significance of this conception was very far-reaching. The problem of life was so sim- plified by substituting the simple protoplasm for the complex organism that its solution seemed to be not very difiicult. This idea of a chemical compound as the basis of all living phenomena gave rise in a short time to a chemical theory of life which was at least tenable, and which ac- counted for the fundamental properties of life. That theory, the chemical theoi'y of life, may be outlined somewhat as follows: The study of the chemical nature of substances derived from living organisms has developed into what has been called organic chemistry. Organic chemistry has shown that it is possible to manufacture artificially many of the compounds which are called organic, and which had been hitherto regarded as produced only by living organisms. At the beginning of the century, it was supposed to be impossible to manufacture by artificial means any of the compounds which animals and plants produce as the result of their life. But chemists were not long in showing that this position is untenable. Many of the organic products were soon shown capable of production by artificial means in the chemist’s laboratory. These organic compounds form a series beginning with such simple bodies as carbonic acid (COg), water (H2O), and ammonia

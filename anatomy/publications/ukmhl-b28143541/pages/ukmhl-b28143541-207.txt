THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 203 of cell division with resulting hereditary transmis- sion. For all this we must fall back upon the structure of protoplasm, and say that the cell machinery is so adjusted that the machine, when acting as a whole, is capable of transforming the energy of chemical composition in certain direc- tions. These fundamental properties are then the properties of the cell machine just as surely as printing is the property of the printing press. We can no more account for the life phenomena by chemical powers than we can for printing by chemical forces manifested in the burning of the coal in the engine-room. To be sure, it is the chemical forces in the engine-room that furnishes the energy, but it is the machinery of the press that explains the printing. So, while chemical forces supply life energy, it is the cell machinery that must explain the fundamental living factors. So long as this machine is intact it can continue to run and perform its duties. But it is a very delicate machine, and is easily broken. When it is broken its activities cease. A broken machine cannot run. It is dead. In short, we come back once more to the idea of the machinery of proto- plasm, and must base our understanding of its properties upon its structure. It is proper to state that there are still some biologists who insist that the ultimate explanation of protoplasm is purely chemical, and that life phenomena may be manifested in mixtures of compounds that are purely physical mixtures, and not machines. It is claimed that much of this cell structure described above is due to im- perfection in microscopic methods, and does not

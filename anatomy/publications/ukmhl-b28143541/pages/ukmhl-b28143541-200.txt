196 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. tioDs and isolations, and this factor has doubtless played a more or less important part in the building of the machines. How great a part we cannot say, nor is it necessary for our purpose to decide; for in all these cases the machine building has only been the result of the heredi- tary transmission of congenital variation under certain peculiar conditions. The fundamental process is the same as already considered, only the details of its working being in question. DIRECT INFLUENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. Under this head we have a subject of great importance. It is an undoubted fact that the environment has a very decided effect upon the machine. These direct effects of the environment are very positive and in great variety. tropical sun darkens the human skin ; cold cli- mate stunts the growth of plants; lack of dwarfs all animals and plants, and hundi’^eds. of other similar examples could be selected. Another class of similar influences are those pro- - duced by use and disuse. Beyond question the; use of an organ tends to increase its size, and I disuse to decrease it. Combats of animals with ^ each other tend to increase their strength, flight! from enemies their running powers, etc. Now all these effects are direct moditicationSj of the machine, and if they are only transmitted! to following generations so as to become perma- nent modifications, they will be most agencies in the machine building. other hand, they are not transmitted by heredity,,

156 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. separated from each other and remained inde- pendent. But so long as this habit continued there could be little advance. After a time some of the cells failed to separate after divi- sion, but remained clinging together (Fig. 45). The cells of such a mass must have been at first all alike; but, after a little, differences began to appear among them. Those on the outside of the mass were dif- ferently affected by their sur- roundings from those in the in- terior, and soon the cells began to share among themselves the dif- ferent duties of life. The cells on the outside were better situ- ated for protection and capturing those on the inside could not food for themselves, and took upon themselves the duty of digesting the food which was handed to them by the outer cells. Each of these sets of cells could now carry on its own special duties to better advantage, since it was freed from other duties, and thus the whole mass of cells was better served than when each cell tried to do everything for itself. This was the first step in the building of the machine out of the active cells (Fig. 46). From such a starting point the subsequent his- tory has been ever based upon the same prin- ciple. There has been a constant separation of the different functions of life among groups of cells, and as the history went on this division of labour among the different parts became greater Fig. 45.

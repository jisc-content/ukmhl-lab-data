Now such an egg is a complete cell, but it is not able to begin the process of division which shall give rise to a new individual until it has united with another cell of quite a different sort and commonly dei ived from a different individual called the male. AVhy the egg cell is unable to develop without such union with male cell does not concern us here, but its purpose will be evident as the descrip- tion proceeds. The egg cell as it comes from the ovary of the female individ- ual is, however, not yet ready for union with the male cell, but must first nucleolus. through a series of somewhat remarkable changes con- stituting what is called maturation of the egg. This phenomenon has such an intimate relation to all problems connected with the cell, that it must be described somewhat in detail. There are considerable differences in the details of the process as it occurs in various animals, but they all agree in the fundamental points.

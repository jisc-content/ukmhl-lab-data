THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 149 of comprehending the life phenomena in our chemical and mechanical laws. But have we thus reduced these fundamental phenomena to an intelligible explanation ? It must be acknowledged that we have not We have reduced them to the action of chemical forces acting m a machine. But the machine 1 self IS unintelligible. The organic cell is no inte hgible to us than is the body as a whole The chemical understanding which we hought we had a few years ago in protoplasm has failed us, and nothing has taken its place We have no conception of what may be the substance. All we can say is that this most marvellous of all natural pheno- mena occurs only within that peculiar piece of machinery which we call the cell, and that it is the result of the action of physical forces in that machine. How the machine acts, or even the structure of the machine, we are as far from undeptanding as we were fifty years ago. The solution has retreated before us even faster than we have advanced toward it. SUMMARY. We may now notice in a brief summary the position which we have reached. In our atteinpt to explain the living organism on the principle of the machine, we are very successful far as secondary problems are concerned Digestion, circulation, respiration, and motion are readily solved upon chemical and mechanical principles. Even the phenomena of the nervous

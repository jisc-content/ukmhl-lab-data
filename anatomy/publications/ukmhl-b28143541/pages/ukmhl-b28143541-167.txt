At one time it was believed that it was the key which would unlock all doors, and for a decadi biologists eagerly pursued embryology with the expectation that it would solve all problems in connection with the history of animals. The result has been somewhat disappointing. Em- bryology has, It is true, been of the utmost service in showing relationships of forms to each '■«''ealmg past history. But wfo h h' ^ " record which has unfortunately been subject to such modifying conditions that in maiy cases its entirely obliterated corrl ‘ worthless as a historical re- cord. The imperfections in regard to the record were early seen after the attention of biologists was seriously turned to the study of embryology but It was expected that it would be possible to correct them and discover the true meaning underlying th^e more apparent one. Indeed in many cases this has been found possible. But render°it modifications are so profound as to cover the entangle them and dis- cover the true meaning. As a result the biolo- gist to-day IS showing less confidence in embryo- logy, and IS turning his attention in differe^nt lllle^desfoed!"

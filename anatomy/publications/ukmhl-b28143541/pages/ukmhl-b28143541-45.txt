IS THE BODY A MACHINE? 41 Absorption of food.—The next function of this machine to attract our attention is the absorption of food from the intestine into the blood. The digested food is carried down the alimentary canal in a purely mechanical fashion by muscular action, and when it reaches the intestine it begins to pass through its walls into the blood. In this absorption we find engaged another set of forces, the chief of which appears to be the physical force of osmosis. The force of osmosis has no special connection with life. If a membrane separates two liquids of dif- ferent composi- tion (Fig. 1), a force is exerted on the liquids which causes them to pass through the membrane, each passing through B—To illustrate osmosis. In the vessel ° A is a solution of sugar; in B, is pure one memorane water. The two are separated by the into the other membrane C. The sugar passes through the membrane into B. compartment. The force which drives these liquids through the membrane is considerable, and may some- times be exerted against considerable pres- sure. A simple experiment will illustrate this force. In Fig. 2 is represented a mem- branous bag tightly fastened to a glass tube. The bag is filled with a strong solution of sugar, and is immersed in a vessel containing pure water. Under these conditions some of the sugar

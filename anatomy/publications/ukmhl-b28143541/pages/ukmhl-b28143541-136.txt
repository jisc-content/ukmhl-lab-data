132 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. With this understanding we can, at least, in part understand the purpose of fertilization. As we shall see later, it is very necessary in the building of the living machine for each indi- vidual to inherit characters from more than one individual. This is necessary to poduce the numerous variations which ^ntribute to the construction of the machine. For this pur- pose there has been developed the process of sexual union of reproductive cells, which intro- duces into the offspring chromatic material from two parents. But if the two reproductive cells shoidd unite at once the number of chromo- somes would be doubled in each generation, and hence be constantly increasing. io vent this the polar cells are ^ cast out w^ch reduces the amount of chromatic material, ine union of the two pronucleii is plainly to produce a nucleus which shall contain chromosomes, and hence hereditary traits from each parent and the subsequent splitting of these chromosomes and the separation of the two halves into daughter nuclei! insures that all the nucleii, and hence all cells of the adult, shall possess hereditary traits derived from both parents. Thus it conies that, even in the adult, every body cell is made up of chromosomes from each parent, and may hence inherit characters from each. , The cell of an animal thus consists of three somewhat distinct but active parts — the cell substance, the chromosomes, and the Of these the cell substance appears to be handea down from the mother; the centrosome comes at least in some cases, from the father, and t

14:0 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. consisting of a large number of separate mde- pendent cells, consists of one great mass of hying matter which is aggregated into little centres, each commonly holding a nucleus. Such a con- clusion is not yet demonstrated, nor is its sig- nificance very clear should it prove to be a fact; but it is plain that such suggestions quite decidedly modify the conception of the body as a community of independent cells. There is yet another line of thought which is weakening this early conception of the cell doctrine. There is a growing conviction that the view of the organism, simply as the sum of the activities of the individual cells, is not a correct understanding of it. According to this extreme position, a living thing can have no organization until it appears as the result of cell multiplication. To take a concrete case, the e„g of a starfish can not possess any organization corresponding to the starfish. The egg is a single cell, and the starfish a community of cells. The egg can, therefore, no more contain th oriranizltion of a starfish than a hunter m the backwoods can contain within himself the organ - zation of a great metropolis. The of individuals like the hunter may unite to foim a city, and the descendants of the egg 1^^’ by combining, give rise to *« .starfish But neither can the man contain within himself the organization of the city, * starfish. It is, perhaps true treme position of the cell doctrine has not been held by any one, but . thoughts very closely approximating to this view have been held by

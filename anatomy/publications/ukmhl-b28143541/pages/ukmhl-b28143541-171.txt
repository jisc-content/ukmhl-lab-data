THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 167 fingers and bones of the arm were still distinct, and yet the whole formed a true wing. Thus we see that the common point of origin which is suggested by the likenesses between an arm and a wing is no mere imaginary one, for the fossil record has Fig. 47. Fig. 48.

In life covered with feathers and serving as a wing. shown us the path leading to that point of origin. The whole tells us further that nature’s method of producing a grasping or flying organ was here, not to build a new organ, but to take one that had hitherto been used for other pur- poses, and by slow changes modify its form and function until it was adapted to new duties.

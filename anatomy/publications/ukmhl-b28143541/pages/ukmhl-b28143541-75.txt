THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 71 activities. Why is it that the oxidation of starch in the living machine gives rise to motion, growth, and reproduction, while if the oxidation occurs in the chemistâ€™s laboratory, or even in a bit of dead protoplasm, it simply gives rise to heat ? One of the primary questions to demand atten- tion in this search is whether we are to find the explanation, at the bottom, a chemical or a mechanical one. In the simplest form of life in which vital manifestations are found are we to attribute these properties simply to chemical forces of the living substance, or must we here too attribute them to the action of a complicated machinery ^ This question is more than a formal one. That it is one of most profound significance will appear from the following considerations. Chemical affinity is a well-recognized force. Under the action of this force chemical com- pounds are produced and different compounds formed under different conditions. The proper- ties of the different compounds differ with their composition, and the more complex are the com- pounds the more varied their properties. Now it might be assumed as an hypothesis that there could be a chemical compound so complex as to possess, among other properties, that of causing the oxidation of food to occur in such a way as to produce assimilation and growth. Such a com- pound would, of course, be alive, and it would be just as true that its power of assimilating food would be one of its physical properties as it is that freezing is a physical property of water. If such an hypothesis should prove to be the true

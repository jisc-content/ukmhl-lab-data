THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM, 66 THE VITAL FACTOR. With all this explanation of life processes it can not fail to be apparent that we have not really reached the centre of the problem. We have explained many secondary processes but the primary ones are still unsolved. In studying digestion we reach an understanding of every- thing until we come to the active vital proper y of the gland-cells in secreting. In studying absorption we understand the process until we come to what we have called the vital powers of the absorptive cells of the alimentary canal. The circulation is intelligible until we come to the beating of the heart and the contraction of the muscles of the blood-vessels. Excretion is also partly explained, but here again we finally must refer certain processes to the vital po^e^s of active cells. And thus wherever we ppbe the problem we find ourselves able to explain many secondary problems, while the fundamental ones we still attribute to the vital properties of the active tissues. Why a muscle contracts or a gland secretes we have certainly not yet answered. The relation of the actions to the general prob- lems of correlation of force^ is simple enough. That a muscle is a machine in the sense of definition is beyond question. But the problem of ivhy a muscle acts is not answered by showing that it derives its energy from broken food material. There are plainly still left for us a number of fundamental problems, although the secondary ones are soluble. What can we say in regard to these funda-

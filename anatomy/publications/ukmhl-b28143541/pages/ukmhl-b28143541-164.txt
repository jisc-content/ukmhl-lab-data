160 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. At the outset we have the question of fact, and we must notice the grounds upon which we stand in assuming this history to be as outlined. This problem is the one which has occupied such a prominent place in the scientific world during the last forty years, and which has contri- buted so largely toward making modern biology such a different subject from the earlier studies of natural history. It is simply the evidence for organic evolution, or the theory of descent. The subject has for forty years been thor- oughly sifted and tested by every conceivable sort of test. As a result of the interest in the question there has been disclosed an immense mass of evidence, relevant and irrelevant. As the evidence has accumulated it has become more and more evident that the evolution theory must be recognized as the only one which is in accord with the facts, and the outcome has been a practical unanimity among thinkers that the theory of descent must be the foundation of our further study. The evidence which has forced this conclusion upon scientists we must stop for a moment to consider, since it bears very directly upon the subject we are studying. HISTORICAL. The first source of evidence is naturally a his- torical one. This long history of the constiuc- tion of the living machine has left its record in the rocks which form the earth s surface. ^During this long period the rocks of the earth s crust have been deposited, and in these rocks have

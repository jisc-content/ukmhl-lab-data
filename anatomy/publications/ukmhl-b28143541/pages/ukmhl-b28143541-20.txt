16 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. rather^ than a statical, should ensue. Modern biology was the child of historical geology. But historical geology alone could never have ■ led to the dynamical phase of modern biology. Three other conceptions have contributed in an even greater degree to the development of this; science. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY. The first of these was the doctrine of conserva- tion of energy and the correlation of forces. This; doctrine is really quite simple, and may be out- ■ lined as follows : In the universe, as we know it,, there exists a certain amount of energy or power • of doing work. This amount of energy cam neither be increased nor decreased; energy cam no more be created or destroyed than matter. It exists, however, in a variety of forms, which may' be either active or passive. In the active state it takes some form of motion. The various forces > which we recognize in nature—heat, light, elec-- tricity, chemism, etc. — are simply forms of: motion, and thus forms of this energy. These various types of energy, being only expressions j of the universal energy, are convertible into eachi other in such a way that when one disappears- another appears. A cannon ball flying through the air exhibits energy of motion ; but it strikes^ an obstacle and stops. The motion has appar- ently stopped, but an examination shows thatt this is not the case. The cannon ball and the object it strikes have been heated, and thus the motion of the ball has simply been transformed! into a difterent form of motion, which we call'

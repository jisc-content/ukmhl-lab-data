103 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. significant fact as a substance high mechani- cal complex- ity. The idea of this material as a simple homogeneous compound or as a mixture of such com- pounds is ab- solutely falla- cious. Proto- plasm is to-day known to be made up of parts harmoni- ously adapted to each other in such a way as to form an that protoplasm is to be regarded not only of chemical but also of Fig 23 â€”a cell as it appears to the modem micro- scope. a, protoplasmic reticulum; 6, liquid in its meshes; c, nuclear membrane; rf, nuclear reticulum ; e, chromatin reticulum; /, nucleolus ; pjcentrosomc; /i, centrosphere; vacuole ; j, inert bodies. extraordinarily intricate machine; and the micro- scopist of to-day recognizes clearly that the acti- vities of this material must be regarded as the result of the machinery which makes up proto- plasm rather than as the simple result of its chemical composition. Protoplasm is a machine and not a chemical compound. STRUCTURE OF PROTOPLASM. The structure of protoplasm is not yet thoroughly understood by scientists, but a few general facts are known beyond question. It is

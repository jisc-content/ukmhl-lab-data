52 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. heat or some other vital function. Herein is the' really mysterious part of the life process , but for the present we will overlook the mystery of this action, and consider the results from a purely material standpoint. In a steam engine the fundamental process by which the latent energy of the fuel is liberated is that of oxidation. ^ The oxygen of the air unites with the chemical elements of the tuel, and breaks up that fuel into simple compounds —which may be chiefly considered as tk^ee— carbonic dioxide (COg), water (H2O), and ash. The energy contained in the original compound cannot be held by these simpler bodies, and it therefore escapes as heat. Just the same pro- cess, with of course difference in details is found in the living machine. The food, after reaching the living cell, is united with the oxygen, and, so far as chemical results are concerned, the process is much the same as if it occurred outside the body. Tim food is broken into simpler compounds and the c(m- tained energy is liberated. The energy is, by the mechanism of the machine, changed into motion or nervous impulse, etc The food is broken into simple compounds, which are chiefly carbonic dioxide, water, and ash ; the ash being, however, quite different from the ash obtained from burning coal. Now the engine must have its chimney to remove the gases and vapours (the COo and H^O) and its ashpit for the ashes. In the same way the living machine kas its excretory system for removing wastes. In the removal of the carbonic acid and water we have

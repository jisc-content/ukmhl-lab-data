37 IS THE BODY A MACHINE? decidedly larger than that obtained by any machine yet devised by man. _ The conclusion of the matter up to this point IS then clear. If we leave out of account the phenomena of the nervous system, which we shall consider presently, the general income and outgo of the body as concerns matter and energy is such that the body must be regarded as a machine, which, like I other machines, simply transforms energy without 1 creating or destroying it. To this extent, at least, I animals conform to the law of the conservation, of I energy and are veritable machines. details of the action of the machine. We turn next to some of the subordinate problems concerning the details of the action of the living machine. We have a clear under- standing of the method of action of a steam engine. Its mechanism is simple, and, moreover It was designed by human intelligence. We can understand how the force of chemical affinity breaks up the chemical composition of the coal how the heat thus liberated is applied to the water to vaporise it; how the vapour is col- lected in^ the boiler under pressure; how this press^e is applied to the piston in the cylinder and how this finally results in the revolution of the fly-wheel. It is true that we do not under- stand the underlying forces of chemism, etc., but these forces certainly exist and are the foundation of science. But the mechanism of the engine is intelligible. Our understanding of it is such that, with the forces of chemistry and physics

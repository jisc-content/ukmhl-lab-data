THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 83 the cells themselves are rather small, while the material deposited between them is abundant. This material be- tAveen the cells is really to be re- garded as an ex- cessively thick- ened cell wall and has been secreted by the cell sub- stance lying with- in the cells, so that a bit of car- tilage is really a mass of cells with an exceptionally thick cell wall. At Fig. 16 is blood Here the cells are to be seea floating in a liquid. The liquid ° is colourless and it is the red colour in the blood cells Avhich gives the blood its red colour. The liquid may here again ^ be regarded as - material produced by i cells. At Fig. 17 is a ’ bit of bone showing small irregular cells embedded within a large mass of material which has been deposited by tbe cell. In this case the formed Fig. 14.— Various shaped wood cells from plant tissue.

104 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. thought, in the first place, that it consists of two quite different substances. There is a some- what solid material permeating it, usually re- garded as having a reticulate structure. It is variously described, sometimes as a reticulate network, sometimes as a mass of threads or fibres, and sometimes as a mass of foam (Fig. 23, a). It is extremely delicate and only visible under special conditions and with the best of microscopes. Only under peculiar conditions can it be seen in protoplasm while alive. There is no question, however, that all protoplasm is permeated when alive by a minute delicate mass of material, which may take the form of threads or fibres or may assume other forms. Within the meshes of this thread or reticulum there is found a liquid, perfectly clear and transparent, to whose presence the liquid character of the protoplasm is due (Fig. 23, h). In this liquid no structure can be determined, and, so far as we know, it is homogeneous. Still further study discloses other complexities. It appears that the fibrous material is always marked by the presence of excessively minute bodies, which have been called by various names, but which we will speak of as mirrosomes. Sometimes, indeed, the fibres themselves appear almost like strit\gs of beads, so that they have been described as made up of rows of minute elements. It is immaterial for our pur- pose, however, whether the fibres are to be re- garded as made up of microsomes or not. This much is sure, that these microsomes—granules of excessive minuteness—occur in protoplasm and are closely connected with the fibres (Fig. 23, a).

THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 187 all higher animals and plants at least, each indi- vidual has two parents instead of one. In our study of cells we have seen that the machinery of the cell is such that it requires in the ordinary process of reproduction the union of germinal material from two different individuals to pro- duce a cell which can develop into a new indi- vidual. As we have seen, the egg gets rid of half its chromosomes in order to receive an equal number from a male parent; and thus the fer- tilized egg contains chromosomes, and hence hereditary material, from two different indi- viduals. Now, this sexual reproduction occurs very widely in the organic world. Among some of the lowest forms of unicellular organisms it is not known, but in most others some form of such union is universal. Now, here is plainly an abundant opportunity for congenital variations; for it is seen that each individual does not come from germ material identical with that from which either parent came, hut from some of this material mixed with a similar amount from a different parent. Now, the two parents are never exactly alike, and hence the germ plasm which each contri- butes to the offspring will not be exactly alike. The offspring will thus be the result of the un- folding of a bit of germ plasm which will be different from that from which either of its parents developed, and these differences will result in congenital variations. Sexual reproduction thus results in congenital variations; and if congenital variations are necessary for the evolution of the living machine—and we shall soon see reason for believing that they are—we find that sexual

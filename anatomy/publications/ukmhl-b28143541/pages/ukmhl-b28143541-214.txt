210 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. application of physical and chemical forces acting in the living machine. These secondary^ pheno- mena include such processes as the digestion and absorption of food, circulation, respiration, excretion, bodily motion, etc. Nervous phe- nomena also doubtless come under this head, at least so far as concerns nervous force. We have been obliged, however, to exclude from this correlation the mental phenomena. Mental phe- nomena can not as yet be measured, and have not yet been shown to be correlated with physical energy. In other words, it has not yet beem proved that mental force is energy at all; and if: it is not energy, then of course it can not be* included in the laws which govern the physical I energy of the universe. Although a, close rela-- tion exists between physical changes in thebraini cells and mental phenomena, no further connec- tion has yet been drawn between mental powerr and physical force. All other secondary phe-- nomena, however, are intelligently explained by, the action of natural forces in the machinery on the living organism. While we have thus found that the secondary phenomena of life are intelligible as the result! of the structure of the machine, certain otheri fundamental phenomena have been constantly} forcing themselves upon our attention as a/oiW2^«^ tion of these secondary activities. The power o contraction, the power of causing certain kind : of chemical change to occur which result in metai holism, the property of sensibility, the property; of reproduction—these are fundamental to at. living activity, and are, after all, the real phe^

98 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. should be applied to the vital activities mani- fested by this substance, protoplasm. While the study of plants and animals was showing scien- tists that natural forces would explain the origin of more complex types from simpler ones through the law of natural selection, here in this concep- tion of protoplasm was a theory which promised to show how the simplest forms may have been derived from the non-living. For an explanation of the origin of life by natural means appeared now to be a simple matter.^ It required now no violent stretch of the imagination to explain the origin of life some- thing as follows W^e know that the chemical elements have certain affinities for each other, and will unite with each other under proper con- ditions. We know that the methods of union and the resulting compounds vary with the con- ditions under which the union takes place. W^e know further that the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen have most remarkable pro- perties, and unite to form an almost endless series of remarkable bodies when brought into^ combination under different conditions. We know that by varying the conditions the chemist can force these elements to unite into a most extraordinary variety of compounds with an equal variety of properties. What more natural, then, than the assumption that under certain conditions these same elements would unite in such a way as to form this compound protoplasm; and then, if the ideas concerning protoplasm were correct, this body would show the properties of protoplasm, and therefore be alive.

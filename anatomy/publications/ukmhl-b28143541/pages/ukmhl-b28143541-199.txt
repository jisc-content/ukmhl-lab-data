THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 195 MIGRATION AND ISOLATION. The production of the various types of machines has been undoubtedly facilitated by the migrations of animals and the isolation of different groups of descendants from each other by ^ various natural barriers. The variations which occur in organisms are so great that they would sometimes run into abnormal structures were it not for the fact that sexual reproduction constantly tends to reduce them. In an open country where animals and plants interbreed freely, it will commonly happen that individuals with certain peculiarities will mate with others without such peculiarities, and the offspring will therefore inherit the peculiarity not in increased degree, but in decreased degree. This constant interbreeding of individuals will tend to prevent the formation of many modifications in the machine which become started by variations. Now plainly if some such individuals, with a peculiar variation, should migrate into a new territory or become isolated from their relatives which do not have similar variations, these individuals will be obliged to breed with each other. The result will be that the next genera- tion, arising thus from two parents each of which shows the same variation, will show it also in equal or increased degree. Mi- grations and isolations will thus tend to fix in the machine variations which sexual union or other influences inaugurate. Now in the history of the earth s surface there have been many changes which tend to bring about such migra-

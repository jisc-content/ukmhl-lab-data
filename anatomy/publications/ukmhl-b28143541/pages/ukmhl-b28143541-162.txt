158 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. have produced different combinations and associa- tions, so that Pekin is wonderfully unlike London. So in these early developing niachines, quite a variety of method of organization was adopted by the different groups. Now as soon as any special type of organization was adopted by any animal or plant, the principle of heredity trans- mitted the same kind of organization to its de- scendants, and there thus arose lines of descent differing from each other, each line having its own method of organization. As we follow the history of each line the same thing is repeated. We find that the representatives of each line again separate into groups, each of which has acquired some new type of organization, an there has thus been a constant divergence ot these lines of descent in an indefinite number of directions. The members of the different lines of descent all show a fundamental likeness with each other since they retain the fundamental characters of their common ancestor but they show also the differences which they have them- selves acquired. And thus the process is le- peated over and over again. This history of the growth of these different machines has thus been one of divergence from common centres, and is to be diagrammatically expressed alter the fashion of a branching tree. The end of each branch represents the highest state of perfection to which each line has been carried. One other point in this history must be noted. As the development of the complication ot the machine progressed the possibility of further progress has been constantly narrowed. When

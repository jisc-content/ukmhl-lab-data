126 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. with just one half the number of chromosomes normal for the cells of the animal in question. Meantime the first pole cell has also divided, so that we have now, as shown in Fig. 40, four cells, three small and one large, but each con- taining one half the normal number of chromo- somes. In the example figured, four is the normal number for the cells of the animal. The egg at the beginning of the process contained efght, but has now been reduced to two. In the further history of the egg the smaller cells, called polar cells, take no part, since they soon disappear and have nothing to do with the animal which is to result from the further division of the egg. This process of the for- mation of the polar cells is thus simply a device for getting rid of some of the chromatin material in the egg cell, so that it may unite with a second cell without doubling the normal number of chromosomes. Previously to this process the other sexual cell, the spermatozoon, or male reproductive cell, has been undergoing a somewhat similar process. This is also a true cell (Fig. 34, me), although it is of a decidedly smaller size than the egg and of a very different shape. It contains cell substance, a nucleus with chromosomes, and a centrosome, the number of chromosomes, as shown later, being ho^^^ever only lialf^ that normal for the ordinary cells of the animals. The study of the development of the sperma- tozoon shows that it has come from cells which contained the normal number of four, but that this number has been reduced to one half by a

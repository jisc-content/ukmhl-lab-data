THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 153 any forces in nature which are of such a sort as of explain the building 0 inaehines ? Plants and animals are the only machines which nature has produced. They are tee only instances in nature of a structure built ^her tn r adjusted to each other to the performance of certain ends. All acquainted were made by man, and in making them intelli- gence came in to adapt the parts fo each other. Put in the hying organism is a similarly adapted Here again we must attack the problem from what seems to be the wrong end. Apparently it would be simpler to discover the method of the mnufacture of the simplest machine rather than the more complex ones. But this has proved IS that the simplest hying machine is the cell whose study must always involve the use of the microscope, and for this reason is more difficult the problem is really a more difficult one than to explain the building of the more complex machines out of the simpL ones At all events, the last fifty years have tnirl ! ' much of the method of the building of the com P ex machines out of the simpler ones, whil^Z not even a hint as to the solution of the building of the simplest machine from the inanimate world. Our attention must There- fore, be first directed to the method by which

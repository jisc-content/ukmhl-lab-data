61 IS THE BODY A MACHINE? brain structure. Further, it is found that certain visible changes occur in certain parts of the brain —the brain cells—when they are excited into mental activity. Such series of facts point to an association between the mental side of sensations and physical structure of the machine. But they do not prove any correlation between them. The unlikeness of mental and physical pheno- mena is so absolute that we must hesitate about drawing any connection between them. It is impossible to conceive the mental side of a sensa- tion as a form of wave motion. If, further, we take into consideration the other phenomena associated with the nervous system, the more distinctly mental processe'fe, we have absolutely no data for any comparison. We cannot imagine thought measured by units, and until we can conceive of such measurement we can get no meaning from any attempt to find a correlation between mental and physical phenomena. It is true that certain psychologists have tried to build up a conception of the physical nature of mind ; but their attempts have chiefly resulted in build- ing up a conception of the physical nature of the brain, and then ignoring the radical chasm that exists between mind and matter. The possibility of describing a complex brain as growing parallel to the growth of a complex mind has been re- garded as equivalent to proving their identity. All attempts in this direction thus far have simply ignored the fact that the stimulation of a nerve, a purely physical process, is not the same thing as a mental action. What the future may disclose it is hazardous to say, but at present the

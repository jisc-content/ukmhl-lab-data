44 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. than the blood. Under these conditions, which will always occur after food has been digested by the digestive juices, the food will begin to pass through this membranous wall of the in- testine into the blood under the influence of the physical force of osmosis. Thus the prim- ary factor in food absorption is a physical one. W e "m u s t notice, how- ever, that the physical force of osmosis is not the only factor con- cerned in ab- sorption. In the first place, it is found that the food dur- ing its passage through the in- testinal wall, or shortly after- wards, under- goes a further change, so that by the time it has fairly reached the blood it has again changed its chemical nature. These changes are, however, of a chemical nature, and, PiQ 4,—Diagram of a single villus enlarged. B represents the membranous surface covering the villus ; (7, the blood vessels within the villus.

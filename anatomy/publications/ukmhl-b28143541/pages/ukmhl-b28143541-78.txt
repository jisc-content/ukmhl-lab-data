74 THE STOKY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. most ingenious speculation, he could never under- stand the real significance of the cities, since he is not acquainted with the actual living unit. Imagine now, if you will, that this supramundane observer invents a telescope which enables him to perceive more minute objects and thus dis- covers human beings. What a complete revolu- tion this would make in his knowledge of mun- dane affairs! We can imagine how rapidly dis- covery would follow discovery; how it would be found that it was the human beings that build the houses, construct and run the railroads, and con- trol the growth of the cities according to their fancy; and, lastly, how it would be learned that it is the human being alone that grows and multiplies and that all else is the result of his activities. Such a supramundane observer would find himself entering into a new era, in which all his previous knowledge would sink into oblivion. Something of this same sort of revolution was inaugurated in the study of living things by the discovery of cells and protoplasms. Animals and plants had been studied for centuries and many accurate and painstaking observations had been made upon them. Monumental masses of evi- dence had been collected bearing upon their shapes, sizes, distribution, and relations. Anato- my had long occupied the attention of naturalists, and the general structure of animals and plants was already well known. But the discoveries starting in the fourth decade of the century by disclosing the unity of activity changed the aspect of biological science.

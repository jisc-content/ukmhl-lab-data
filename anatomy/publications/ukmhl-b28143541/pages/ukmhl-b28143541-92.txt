88 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. of the fully formed animal or plant, however complex, are simply the application of mechani- cal and chemical principles among the groups ot such cells. But wherein does this knowledge of cells help us 1 Are we any nearer to understand- ing how these vital processes arise ? In answer to this question we may first ask whether it is possible to determine whether any one part of the cell is the seat of its activities. THE CELL WALL. The first suggestion which arose was that the cell wall was the important part of the cell, the others being secondary. This was not an un- natural conclusion. The cell wall is the most persistent part of the cell. It was the part first discovered by the microscope and is the part which remains after the other parts are gone. Indeed, in many of the so-called cells the cell wall is all that is seen, the cell contents having disappeared (Fig. 14). It was not strange, then, that this should at first have been looked upon as the primary part. The idea was that the cell wall in some way changed the chemical character of the substances in contact with its two sides, and thus gave rise to vital activities which, as we have seen, are fundamentally chemical. Thus the cell wall was regarded as the most essential part of the cell, since it controlled its activities. This was the belief of Schwann, although he also re- garded the other parts of the cell as of importance. This conception, however, was quite temporary. It was much as if our hypothetical supramundane observer looked upon the clothes of his newly

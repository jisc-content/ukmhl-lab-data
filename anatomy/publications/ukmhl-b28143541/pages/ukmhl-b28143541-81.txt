THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 77 mother liquid. This supposed substance Schwann called the cytoUastema, and he thought it existed between the cells or sometimes within them. For example, the fluid part of the blood is the cytoblastema, the blood corpuscles being the cells. From this structureless fluid the cells were supposed to arise by a process akin to crystallization. To be sure, the cells grow in a manner very different from that of a crystal. A crystal always grows bj^ layers being added upon its outside, while the cells grow by additions within its body. But this was a minor detail, the essential point being that from a structure- less liquid containing proper materials the organ- ized cell separated itself. This idea of the cytoblastema was early thrown into suspicion, and almost at the time of the announcement of the cell doctrine certain micro- scopists made the claim that these cells did not come from any structureless medium, but by division from other cells like themselves. This claim, and its demonstration, was of even greater importance than the discovery of the cells. For a number of years, however, the matter was in dispute, evidence being collected which about equally attested each view. It was a Scotchman, Dr Barry, who finally produced evidence which settled the question from the study of the de- veloping egg. The essence of his discovery was as follows: The ovum of an animal is a single cell, and when it begins to develop into an embryo it first simply divides into two halves, producing two cells (Fig 8, a and b). Each of these in turn divides, giving

THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 207 similar forces at work in building protoplasm. If we can find natural forces by which the simplest bit of living matter can be built up into a complicated machine like the ox, with its many delicately adjusted parts, it is certainly natural to imagine that the same forces may have built this simpler machine with which we started. But such a conclusion is for a simple reason im- possible. We have seen that the essential factor in this machine building is reproduction, with the correlated powers of variation and heredity. Without these forces we could not have advanced in this machine building at all. But these pro- perties are themselves the result of the machinery of protoplasm. We have no reason for thinking that this property of reproduction can occur in any other object in nature except this proto- plasmic machine. Of course, then, if reproduc- tion is the result of the structure of protoplasm we cannot use this factor in explaining the origin of this protoplasm. The powers of the completed machine cannot be brought forward to account for its origin. Thus the one fundamental factor for machine building is lacking, and if we are to explain natureâ€™s method of producing protoplasm from simpler structures, we must either suppose that the parts of the cell are capable of repro- duction and subject to heredity, or we must look for some other method. Such a road has how- ever not yet been found, nor have we any idea in what direction to look. But the fact that nature has methods of machine building, as we have seen, may hold out the possibility that some day we may discover her method

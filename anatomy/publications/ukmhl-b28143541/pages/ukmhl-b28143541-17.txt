I INTRODUCTION. 13 I and the unexplained. The phenomena associated j with living things remained nearly as mysterious i as ever. Life appeared to be the most inex- 1 plicable phenomenon of nature, and none of the : forces and laws which had been found sufficient to â€¢ account for other departments of nature appeared j to have much influence in rendering intelligible I the phenomena of life. Living organisms appeared ) to be actuated by an entirely unique force. Their I shapes and structures showed so many marvellous I adaptations to their surroundings as to render it I apparently certain that their adjustment must j have been the result of some intelligent planning, i and not the outcome of blind force. Who could ] look upon the adaptation of the eye to light < without seeing in it the result of intelligent I design I Adaptation to conditions is seen in all animals and plants. These organisms are evi- I dently complicated machines with their parts I intricately adapted to each other and to sur- ^ rounding conditions. Apart from animals and j plants the only other similarly adjusted machines are those which have been made by human in- telligence ; and the inference seemed to be clear that a similar intelligence was needed to account for the living machine. The blind action of physical forces seemed inadequate. Thus the phenomena of life, which had been studied longer than any other phase of nature, continued to stand aloof from the rest and refused to fall into line with the general drift of thought. The living world seemed to give no promise of being included among natural phenomena, but still persisted in retaining its supernatural aspect.

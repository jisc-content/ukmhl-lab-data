170 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. duce their effects not by sudden additions to the complication of the machine. They must be constant forces whose effect at any one time is comparatively slight, but whose total effect is to increase the complexity of the machine. must be forces which produce new types through the modification of the old ones. We must look for forces which do not adapt the machine for its future, but only for its present need. Each step in the history has been a complete animal with its own fully developed powers. We are not to expect to find forces which planned the perfect machine from the start, nor forces which were engaged in constructing parts for future use. Each step in the building of the machine was taken for the good of the machine at the parti- cular moment, and the forces which we are to look for must therefore be only such as can adapt the organisms for its present needs. ^ In other words, nothing has been produced in this machine for the purpose of being developed later something of value, but all parts that have been produced are of value at the time of their appear- ance. We must, in short, look for forces con- stantly in action and always tending in the same direction of greater complexity of structure. Is it possible to discover these forces and comprehend their action ? Before the modein development of evolution this question would unhesitatingly have been answered in the nega- tive. To-day, under the influence of the descent theory, stimulated, in the first place, by Darwin, the question will be answered by many with equal promptness in the affirmative. At all

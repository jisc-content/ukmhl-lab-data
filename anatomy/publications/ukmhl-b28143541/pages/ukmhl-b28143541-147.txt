THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 143 Organization, in other words, is superior to cell structure, and the cell itself is an organization of smaller units. As the result^ of these various considerations there has been in recent years, something of a reaction against the cell doctrine as formerly held. While the study of cells is still regarded as the key to the interpretation of life pheno- mena, biologists are seeing more and more clearly that they must look deeper than simple cell structure for their explanation of the life pro- cesses. W^hile the study of cells has thrown an immense amount of light upon life, we seem hardly nearer the centre of the problem than we were before the beginning of the series of dis- coveries inaugurated by the formulation of the doctrine of protoplasm. FUNDAMENTAL VITAL ACTIVITIES AS LOCATED IN CELLS. We are now in position to ask whether our knowledge of cells has aided us in finding an ex- planation of the fundamental vital actions to which, as we have seen, life processes are to be reduced. The /our properties of irritability, con- tractibility, assimilation, and reproduction, belong to these vital unitsâ€”the cells, and it is these pro- perties which we are trying to trace to their source as a foundation of vital activity. We may first ask whether we have any facts which indicate that any special parts of the cell are associated with any of these fundamental activities, The first fact that stands out clearly

IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 53 more^ with the respiratory system, and the process is simply a repetition of the story ^ of gas diffusion, chemical union, and osmosis.^ It is sufficient here to say that the process is just as simple and as easily explained as those already described. The elimination of these wastes is simply a problem of chemistry and mechanics. In the removal of the ash, however, we have something more, for here again we are brought up against the vital action of the cell. This ash takes chiefly the form of a compound known as urea, which finds its way into the general circula- tory system. From the blood it is finally removed by the kidneys. In the kidneys are a large nu^mber of bits of living matter (kidney cells), which have the power of seizing hold of the urea as the blood is flowing over them, and after thus taking it out of the blood they deposit it in a series of tubes which lead to the bladder and hence to the exterior. The bringing of this ash to the kidney cell is a mechanical matter, based simply upon the flow of the blood. The seizing of the urea by the kidney cell is a vital pheno- menon which we must waive for the moment. Up to this point in the analysis there has been no difficulty, and no one can fail to agree with the conclusions. The position we reach is as tollows : bo far as relates to the general problems of energy m the universe the body is a machine It neither creates nor destroys energy, but simply transforms one form into another. In attempt- mg to explain the action of the machine, we find that lor the functions thus far considered (some-

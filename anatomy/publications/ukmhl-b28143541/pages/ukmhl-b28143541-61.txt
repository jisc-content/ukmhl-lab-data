IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 57 Now what is the significance of all these facts for our discussion ? Together they point clearly to the conclusion that nervous energy is corre- lated with other forms of physical energy. Since I the nervous stimulus is started by other forms of energy, and since it can, in turn, modify ordinary forms of energy, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the nervous impulse is only a special form of energy developed within the nerve. It is a form of wave motion peculiar to the nerve sub- stance, but correlated with and developed from other types of energy. This, of course, makes the nerve simply a bit of machinery. If this conclusion is true, the development of a nerve impulse would mean that a certain por- tion of food is broken to pieces in the body to liberate energy, and this should be accompanied by an elimination of carbonic dioxide and heat. Ihis IS easily shown to be true of muscle action When we remove a muscle from the body it may reniain capable of contracting for some time. By studying it under these conditions we find that it gives rise to carbonic dioxide and other sub- stances, and liberates heat whenever it contracts. As already noticed, in the respiration experi- ments, whenever the individual experimented upon makes any motions, there is an accompany- ing elimination of waste products and a develop- ment of heat. But this does not appear to be demonstrable for the actions of the nervous system. Although very careful experiments have been made, it has as yet been found impos- sible to detect^ any rise in temperature when a lerve impulse is passing through a nerve, nor is

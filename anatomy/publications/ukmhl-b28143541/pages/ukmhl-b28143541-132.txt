128 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. interest to have this settled, for if it should prove true, then it would evidently follow that the machinery for cell division, in the case of sexual reproduction, is derived from the father, although the bulk of the cell comes from the mother, while the chromosomes come from both parents. In the cases where the process has been most carefully studied, the further changes are as follows: The head of the spermatozoon, after entrance into the egg, lies dormant until the egg pjQ 42 The centrosome has divided, and the two pronucleii have *been brought together.

Close to it lies its centrosomes (Fig. 35, ce), and there is thus formed what is known as the male pronucleus (Fig. 35-40, mn). The remains of the egg nucleus, after having discharged the polar cells,

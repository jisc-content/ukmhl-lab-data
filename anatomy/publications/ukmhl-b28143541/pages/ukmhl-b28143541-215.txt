THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 211 nomena which we wish to explain. But these are not peculiar to the complicated machines. We can discard all the apparent machinery of the animal or plant and find these properties still developed m the simplest bit of living matter. To learn their significance, therefore, we have turned to the study of the simplest form of matter in which Uiese fundamental properties are manifested. Ihis led us at once to the study of the so-called protoplasm, for protoplasm is the simplest known torm of matter that is alive. Protoplasm itself at first seemed to be a homogeneous body, and was looked upon as a chemical compound of hi<^h comp exity. If this were true its propertfes would depend upon its composition, and would be explained by the action of chemical forces, bucfi a conception would have quickly solved the problem, for it would reduce living properties to chemical powers. But the conception proved to be delusive. Protoplasm, at least the simplest orm known to possess the fundamental life pro- perties, soon showed itself to be no chemical compound, but a machine of wonderful intricacy. The lundamental phenomena of life and of protoplasin have proved to be both chemical and mechanical. Metabolism is the result of the oxidation of food, and motion is an instance of transference of force. Our problem then re- solved itself into finding the power that guides the action of these natural forces. Food will not undergo such an oxidation except in the presence ot protoplasm, nor will the phenomena of meta- bdism occur except in the presence of living protoplasm. Clearly, then, the living protoplasm

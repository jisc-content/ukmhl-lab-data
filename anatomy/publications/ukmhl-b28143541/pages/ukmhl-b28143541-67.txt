IS THE BODY A MACHINE? 63 been able to reach a satisfactory positive answer. Digestion, assimilation, circulation, respiration, excretion, the principal categories of physiological action, and at least certain phases of the action of the nervous system are readily understood as controled by the action of chemical and physical forces. In the accom- plishment of these actions there is no need for the supposition of any force other than i those which are at our command in the scientific laboratory. I I THE LIVING MACHINE CONSTRUCTIVE AS WELL AS DESTRUCTIVE. j In one respect the living machine differs from I ill others. The action of all other machines re- I suits in the destruction of organised material, and ibhus in a degradation of matter. For example, a jsteam^ engine receives coal, a substance of high chemical composition, and breaks it into more \nmple compounds, in this way liberating its stored energy. Now if we examine all forms iDf artificial machines, we find in the same way ;;hat there is always a destruction of compounds of high chemical composition. In such machines t is common to start with heat as a source of ■inergy, and this heat is always produced by the Dreaking of chemical compounds to pieces. In dl chemical processes going on in the chemist’s aboratory there is similarly a destruction of organic compounds. It is true that the chemist sometimes makes complex compounds out of simpler ones; but in order to do this he is

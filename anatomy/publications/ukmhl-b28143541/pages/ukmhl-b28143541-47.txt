IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? 43 After digestion, therefore, the food is dissolved in the liquids in the stomach and intestine, and is in proper condition for dialysis. Furthermore, the structure of the intestine is such as to pro- duce conditions adapted for dialy- sis. This can be understood from Fig. 3, which re- presents diagram- matically a cross section through the intestinal wall. Within the in- testinal wall, at A, is the food mass in solution. At B are shown little projections of the intestinal wall, called villi, extending into this food and covered by a membrane. One highly magnified this membrane, vessels, C, and -Diagram of tlio intesfinal walls, lumen of intestine filled with digested food." B, villi, eontaining blood-vessels. C, larger blood-vessel, which carries blood with absorbed food away from ths intestine. of in these villi is shown more Fig. 4, in which B shows Inside of these villi are blood- it will be thus seen that the membrane, B, separates two liquids, one contain- ing the dissolved food outside the villus, and the other containing blood inside the villus. Here are proper conditions for osmosis, and this j^ro- cess of dialysis will take place whenever the in- testinal contents holds more dialyzable material

180 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. changing its nature, and it thus continues to and is handed down from generation to generation, always endowed with developing into a new individual under proper conditfons, and of course when it does S" rise to new individuals, they will all be al k . We can thus easily understand why a child is like ite parU. It is not because the child can inherit directly from its parent, but child and parent have come from the unfo g of two bits of the same germ plasm. This tact of the transmission of the hereditary substance from generation to generation is known as tne theory of the continuity of germ plasm. Such appears to be, at least in part, the ma- chinery of heredity. This understanding makes the genn substance perpetual and continuous, and explains why successive generations are alike X! not explain, indeed, why an mdmdi a inherits from its parents, but w y i is . narents While biologists are still m dispute r^many problems connected with heredity all are a<vreed to-day that this principle of the continuity of the heredity substance must be the basis of all attempts to understand the machiuwy ofCedity. Bu^ plainly this whole process is a function of the cell machinery. While, tbere fore the idea of the continuity of germ greatly simplifies our problem, we must acknow- fedge that once more we are thrown back upo th/mysferies of the cell. Until we can more fullvXCn Ae ““Wne we must recognme our inability to solve the fundamental question of why an individual is like its parents.

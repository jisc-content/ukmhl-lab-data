THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 193 the weakest will go to the wall, while those that are best adapted for their place in life will be the ones to get food, live, and reproduce their kind. 1 his IS at all events true among the lower animals, ^though with mankind the law hardly applies Now among the individuals that are born there will be no two exactly alike, since variations are universal many of which are congenital, and thus born with the individual, and transmitted by in- heritance. Clearly enough, those animals that have a variation which makes them a little better adapted for the struggle will be the ones to live and hence to produce offspring, while those with- out such advantage will be the ones to die We ma,y suppose, for example, that some of the indi- iduals had longer necks than the average. In ime of scarcity of food these individuals would be able to get food that the short-necked indi- viduals could not reach. Hence, in times of amine, the long-necked individuals would be the ones to survive. Now, if this peculiarity were a congenital variation, it would be already repre- wouM b^- b® consequLtly it shori^ \ tl'e next generation. The short-necked individuals being largely destroyed in this struggle for food, it would follow that the the last, since all would inherit this tendency to- the^ see Tlfe T^‘ ^ generations wLld if- u disappearance of all individuals which did not show either this or somrother corresponding advantage, and in this way the i be added permanently L a pari of the macUne.

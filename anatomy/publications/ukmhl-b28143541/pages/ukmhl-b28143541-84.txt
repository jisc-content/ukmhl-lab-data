80 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. a somewhat transparent semifluid material which has received various names, but which for the present we will call cell substance (Fig. 9, p’). It may be abundant or scanty, and has a widely varying consistency from a very liquid mass to a decidedly thick jelly-like substance. Lying within the cell substance is a small body, usually more or less spherical in shape, which is called the nucleus (Fig. 9, n). It appears to the micro- scope similar to the cell substance in character, From the very earliest period that cells have been studied, these three parts, cell wall, cell substance, and nucleus, have been recognised, but as to their relations to each other and to the general activities of the cell there has been the widest variety of opinion. CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF ORGANISMS. It will b) well to notice next just what is meant by saying that all living bodies are com- posed of cells. This can best be understood by and has frequently been described as a bit of the cell substance more dense than the re- ^ mainder. Lying within the nucleus there are usually to be seen one or more smaller rounded Fig. 9.—A cell; cio is the cell wall; pr, the cell substance; the nucleus. bodies which have been called nucleoli.

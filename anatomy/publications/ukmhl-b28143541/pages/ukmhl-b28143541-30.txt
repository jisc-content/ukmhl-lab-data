26 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. universe as constant. Even if that subtile form of force which we call nervous energy should prove to be uncorrelated with other forms of energy, the idea of the conservation of energy must be changed. It is even possible that we must insist that the still more subtile form of force, mental force, must be brought within the scope of this great law in order that it be im- plicitly accepted. This law has proved itself strictly applicable to the inanimate world, and has then thrust upon us the various questions in regard to vital force, and we must recognise that the real significance of this great law must rest upon the possibility of its application to vital j phenomena. No less intimate is the relation of these pro- blems to the doctrine of evolution. Evolution tries to account for each moment in the history of the world as the result of the conditions of the moment before. Such a theory loses its meaning unless it can be shown that natural forces are sufficient to account for living phenomena. If the supernatural must be brought in here and there | to account for living phenomena, then evolution ; ceases to have much meaning. It is undoubtedly i a fact that the rapidly developing ideas along the above mentioned lines of dynamical biology have been potent factors in bringing about the adop- tion of evolution. Certain it is that, had it been found that no correlation could be traced i between vital and non-vital forces, the doctrine of evolution could not have stood, and even now the special significance which we shall in the end give to evolution will depend upon how we sue-

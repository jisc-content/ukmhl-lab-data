54 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. times called the vegetative functions) the laws of chemistry and physics furnish adequate ex- planation. ^ We must now look a little furtker, and question some of the functions the mechanical nature of which is less obvious. The whole operation thus far described is under the control of the nervous system, which acts somewhat like the engineer of an engine. Can this phase of living activity be included within the conception of the body as a machine 'I ^ . x Nervms System.—When we come to try to apply mechanical principles to the nervous system, we meet with what seems at first to be no thoroughfare. While dealing with the grosser questions of chemical compounds, heat and motion, there is little difijculty in appl^ying natural laws to the explanation of living pheno- mena. But the problem with the nervous system is very different. It is only to-day that we are finding that the problem is open to study, to say nothing of solution. It is true that mental and other nervous phenomena have been studied tor a long time, but this study has been simply the study of these phenomena by themselves without a thought of their correlation with other pheno- mena of nature. It is a matter of quite recent conception that nervous phenomena have any direct relation to the other realms of nature. Our first question must be whether we can find any correlation between neryous energy and other types of energy. For our purpose it will be convenient to distinguish between the mena of simple nervous transmission and the

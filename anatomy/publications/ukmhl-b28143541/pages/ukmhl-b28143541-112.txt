108 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. long. Facts like these demonstrate conclusively the vital importance of the nucleus in cell activ- ity, and show us that the cell, with its power of continued life, must be regarded as a combina- tion of proto- plasm with its nucleus, and cannot exist without it. It is not proto- plasm, but cell substance, plus cell nucleus, which forms the simplest basis of life. As more careful study of protoplasm was made it soon became evident that there is a very decided dif- ference be- tween the nu- cleus and the protoplasm. The old statement that the nucleus is simply a bit of dense protoplasm is not true. In its chemical and physical composition as well as ill its activities the nucleus shows itself to be entirely different from the protoplasm. It con- tains certain definite bodies not found in the Fio. 25.—A cell cut into three pieces, only one of which, No. 2, contains any nucleus. This fragment soon acquires the original form and continues its life indefinitely, as shown at B. The other two pieces though living for a time, die without reproducing.

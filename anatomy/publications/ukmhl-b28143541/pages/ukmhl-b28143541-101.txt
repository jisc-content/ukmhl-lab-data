THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 97 cornpound was a very unstable compound, just as is a mass of gunpowder, and hence it is highly irritable, also like gunpowder, and any disturb- ance of its condition produces motion, just as a spark will do in a mass of gunpowder. It is capable of inducing oxidation in foods, some- thing as water induces oxidation in a bit of iron The oxidation is, however, of a different kind, and results in the formation of different chemical combinations; but it is the basis of assimilation. Since now assimilation is the foundation of growth and reproduction, this mechanical theory of life thus succeeded in trac- mg to the simple properties of the chemical com- rr fPÂ® fundamental properties ot life. Since further, as we have seen in our first chapter, the more complex properties of higher or- pnisms are easily deduced from these simple ones by the application of the laws of mechanics we have here in this mechanical theory of life the complete reduction of the body to a machine. THE REIGN OF PROTOPLASM. This substance protoplasm became now natur- ally the centre of biological thought. The theory of protoplasm arose at about the same time that the doctrine of evolution began to be seriously discussed under the stimulus of Darwin, and naturally these two great conceptions developed side by side. Evolution was constantly teaching that natural forces are sufficient to account for many of the complex phenomena which had hitherto been regarded as insolvable; and what more natural than that the same kind of thinking

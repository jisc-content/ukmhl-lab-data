67 IS THE BODY A MACHINE ? mental vital powers of the active tissues ? Firstly, we must notice that many of the pro- cesses which we now understand were formerly classed as vital, and we only retain under this term those which are not yet explained. This, of course, suggests to us that perhaps we may some day find an explanation for all the so-called vital powers by the application of simple physical forces. Is it a fact that the only significance to the term vital is that we have not yet been able to explain these processes to our entire satisfac- tion? Is the diference between what we have called the secondary processes and the primary ones only one of degree ? Is there a probability that the actions which we now call vital will some day be as readily understood as those which have already been explained ? Is there any method by which we can approach these fundamental problems of muscle action, heart beat, gland secretion, etc.? Evidently, if this is to be done, it must be by resolving the body into its simple units and studying these units. Our study thus far has been a study of the machinery of the body as a whole; but we have found that the various parts of the machine are themselves active, that apart from the action of the general machine as a whole, the separate parts have vital powers. We must, therefore, get rid of this complicated machinery, which confuses the problem, and see if we can find the fundamental units which show these properties unencumbered^ by the secondary machinery which has hitherto attracted our attention. We must turn now to the problem connected

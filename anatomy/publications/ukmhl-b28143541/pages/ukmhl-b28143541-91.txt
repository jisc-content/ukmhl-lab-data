THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 87 fied to perform different functions. The different organs appear within the cell, and the cell is more complex than the typical cell described. Fig. 21 shows such a cell. Such an animal possesses several or- gans, but, since it consists of a single mass of protoplasm and a single nucleus, it is still only a single cell. In the multicellular organ- isms the organs of the body are made up of cells, and the different organs are produced by a dif- ferentiation of cells, but in the unicel- Fig. 21.—a complex cell, it is an lular organisms the entire animal, but composed of ° , only one cell. organs are the re- sults of the differentiation of the parts of a single cell. In the one case there is a differentia- tion of cells, and in the other of the parts of a cell. Such, in brief, is the cell to whose activities it is possible to trace the fundamental properties of all living things. Cells are endowed with the properties of irritability, contractibility, assimila- tion and reproduction, and it is thus plainly to the study of cells that we must look for an in- terpretation of life phenomena. If we can reach an intelligible understanding of the activities of the cell our problem is solved, for the activities

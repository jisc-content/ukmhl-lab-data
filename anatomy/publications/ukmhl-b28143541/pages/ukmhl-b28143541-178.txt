174 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. HEREDITY. The offspring which arise by these processes of division are like each other, and hk® the parent from which they sprung. This is th^e essence of what is called heredity. Its signi - cance in the process of machine building is evL dent at once. It is the conserving force which preserves the forms already produced and makes it possible for each generation to build upon the structures of the earlier ones. Without it each generation would have to begin anew at the beginning, and nothing could be accomplished. But since this principle brings each individual to the same place where its parents stand, and thus always builds the offspring into a machine like the parent, it makes it possible for the successive generations to advance. Heredity is thus like the power of memory, or better still, like the inven- tion of printing in the development of civilization. It is a record of past achievements. By means of printing each age is enabled to benefit by the discoveries of the previous age, and without it the > development of civilization would be impossible.. In the same way heredity enables each generation i to benefit by the achievements of its ancestors; in the process of machine building, and thus to) devote its own energies to advancement. The fact of heredity is patent enough. It has? been always clearly recognized that the child has? the characters of its parents, and this belief is so; well attested as to need no proof. It is still, a question as to just what characters may be. inherited, and what influences may affect the^

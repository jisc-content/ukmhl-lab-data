18 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. all forms of energy in nature. It is primarily a physical doctrine, and has been developed chiefly in connection with the physical sciences. But it shows at once a possible connec^on between living and non-living nature. The living organism also exhibits motion and heat, and, if the doctrine of the conservation of energy be true, this energy must be correlated with other forms of energy. Here is a sugges- tion that the same laws control the living and the non-living world ; and a suspicion tlmt if we can find a natural explanation of the burn- inf^ of a piece of coal and the motion ot a locomotive, so, too, we may find a natural explanation of the motion of a living machine. EVOLUTION. A second conception, whose influence upon the development of biology was even greater, was the doctrine of evolution. It is true that the doctrine of evolution was no new doctiine with the middle of this century, for it had been conceived somewhat vaguely before. But until historical geology had been formulated, and until the idea of the unity of nature had dawned upon the minds of scientists, the doctrine of evolution had little significance. It made little difference in our philosophy whether the living organisms were regarded as independent creations or as descended from each other, so long as they were looked upon as a distinct realm of nature without connection with the rest of nature’s activity. If they are distinct

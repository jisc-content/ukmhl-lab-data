•■ec '€TV THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 157 and greater. Group after group of ^ells WQve set apart for one special duty after another, and the result was a larger and ever more compli- cated mass of cells, Avith a greater and greater differentiation among them. In this building of the machine there was no time Avhen the machine was not active. At all points the machine was alive and func- tional, but each step made the total function of the machine a little more accurately per- formed, and hence raised someAvhat the totality of life l^owers. This parcelling out of the different duties of life to groups of cells continued age after age, each step being a little advance over the last, until the result has been the living machine as we knoAv it in its highest form, Avith its numerous organs all interrelated in such a way as to form a harmoniously acting whole. But a second principle in this growth of the machine was needed to produce the variety which IS found in nature. As the different cells in the multicellular mass became associated into groups for different duties, the method of such division ot labour Avas not alike in all machines. A city in China and one in England are alike made up of individuals, and the fundamental needs of the CMnaman and the Englishman are alike. But differences m industrial and political conditions Fig. 46. A later step in machine building in which the outer cells have ac- quired different form and function from the inner cells: ec, the outer cells,whose duties are protective ; en, the inner cells engaged in digesting food.

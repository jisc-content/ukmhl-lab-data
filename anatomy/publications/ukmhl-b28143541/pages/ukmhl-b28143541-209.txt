THE LIVING MACHINE BUILDING FACTORS. 205 We must first notice that no notion of chemical evolution helps us out. It has been a favourite thought with some that the origin of the first living thing was the result of chemical evolution. As the result of physical forces there was pro- duced, from the original nebulous mass, a more and more complicated system, until the world was formed. Then chemical phenomena became more and more complicated, until, with the pro- duction of more and more complicated compounds, protoplasm was finally produced. A few years ago, under the impulse of the idea that protoplasm was a compound, or at least a simple mixture of compounds, this thought of protoplasm as the result of chemical evolution was quite significant. Physical forces, chemical forces, and vital fences ex- plain successively the origin of toorlds, protoplasm, and organisms. This conception has, however, no longer much significance. We know of no such living chemical compound, apart from cell machinery. A new conception of protoplasm has arisen which demands a different explanation of its origin. Since it is a machine rather than a compound, mechanical rather than chemical forces are required for its explanation. Have we then any suggestion as to the method of the origin of this protoplasmic machine ? Our answer must, at the present, be certainly in the negative. The complexity of the cell tells us plainly that it cannot be the ultimate living substance which may have arisen from chemical evolution. It is made up of parts delicately adapted to act in harmony with each other, and its activity depends upon the relation of these

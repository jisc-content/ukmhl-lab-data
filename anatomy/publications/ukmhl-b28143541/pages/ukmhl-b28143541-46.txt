42 THE STORY OF LIFERS MECHANISM. solution passes through the hag into the water, and some of the water passes from the vessel into the bag. But if the solution of sugar is inside the bag and the pure water outside, the amount of liquid passing into the bag is greater than the amount passing out; the bag soon becomes distended and the water even rises in the tube to a con- siderable height at a (Fig. 2). The force here concerned is a force known as osmosis or dialysis, and is always exerted when two different solutions of certain substances are separated from each other by a membrane. The substances in solution will, under these conditions, pass from the dense to the weaker solution. The process is a purely physi- cal one. This process of osmosis lies at the basis of the absorption of food from the In the PICT passes out and -water place, mOSt of the food into the bladder until , ^ i , it rises in the tube wlieil swailowed IS liot SOlll- to «■ ble, and therefore not capable of osmosis. But the process of digestion, as we have seen, changes the chemical nature of the food. The food, as tlte result of chemical change, has become soluble, ami after being dis- solved it is dialyzahle, i.e. capable of osmosis.

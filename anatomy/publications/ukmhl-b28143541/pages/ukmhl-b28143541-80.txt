76 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. cells of plants. In the early part of this century observations upon various kinds of animals and plant tissues multiplied, and many microscopists independently announced the discovery of similar small corpuscular bodies. Finally, in 1839, these observations "were combined together by Schwann into one general theory. According to the cell doctrine then formulated, the parts of all animals and plants are either composed of cells or of ' material derived from cells. The bark, the wood, the roots, the leaves of plants are all com- posed of little vesicles similar to those already described under the name of cells. In animals the cellular structure is not so easy to make out; but here too the muscle, the bone, the nerve, the glands are all made up of similar vesicles or of material made from them. The^ cells are of wonderfully different shapes and widely different sizes, but in general structure they are alike. These cells, thus found in animals and plants alike, formed the first connecting link between animals and plants. This discovery was like that of our supposed supramundane observer when he first found the human being that brought into connection the widely different cities in the various parts of the world. Schwann and his immediate followers, while recognizing that the bodies of animals and plants were composed of cells, were at a loss to explain how these cells arose. The belief held at^ first was that there existed in the bodies of animals and plants a structureless substance which formed the basis out of which the cells develop, in some- what the same way that crystals arise from a

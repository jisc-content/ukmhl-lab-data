186 THE STORY OF LIFE’S MECHANISM. although we do not know what sort of influences can produce them. If the germ plasm is wholly stored within the reproductive gland, it is cer- tainly in a position to be only slightly affected by surrounding conditions which affect the animal. We can readily understand that the use of an organ like the arm will affect it in such a way as to produce changes in its proto- plasm, but we can hardly imagine that such use of the arm would produce any change in the hereditary substance which is stored in the re- productive organs. External conditions may thus readily affect the body, but not so readily the germ material. Even if such material is dis- • tributed more or less over the body instead of being confined to the reproductive glands, asi some believe, the difficulty is hardly lessened.. This difficulty of understanding how the germi plasm can be affected by external conditions has 5 led one school of biologists to deny that it is 5 subject to any variation by external conditions,, and hence that all modification of the germ plasmi must come from some other source. Probably/ ho one, however, holds this position to-day, andl it is the general belief that the germ plasm may/ be to some slight extent modified by external 1 conditions. Of course, if such variations da occur in the germ plasm they will become con-i genital variations of the next generation, sincct the next generation is the unfolding of the gernn ^ The second method by which the variations of germ plasm may arise is apparently of more imi portance. It is based upon the fact that, with

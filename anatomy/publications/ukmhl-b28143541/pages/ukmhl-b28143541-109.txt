THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. 105 THE NUCLEUS. (a) Presence of a Nucleus.â€”If protoplasm has thus become a new substance in our minds as the result of the discoveries of the last twenty years, far more marvellous have been the dis- coveries made in connection with that body which has been called the nucleus. Even by the early microscopists the nucleus was recognized, and during the first few years of the cell doctrine it was frequently looked upon as the most active part of the cell and as especially connected with its reproduction. The doctrine of protoplasm, however, so captivated the minds of biologists that for quite a number of years the nucleus was ignored, at least in all discussions connected with the nature of life. It was a body in the cell whose presence was unexplained and which did not fall into accord with the general view of protoplasm as the physical basis of life. Eor a while, therefore, biologists gave little attention to it, and were accustomed to speak of it simply as a bit of protoplasm a little more dense than the rest. The cell was a bit of protoplasm with a small piece^ of more dense protoplasm in its centre appearing a little ditferent from the rest and perhaps the most active part of the cell. As a result of this excessive belief in the efficiency of protoplasm the question of the presence of a nucleus in the cell was for a while looked upon as one of comparatively little importance. Many cells were found to have nuclei! while others did not show their presence and microscopists therefore believed that the

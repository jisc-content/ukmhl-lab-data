30 THE STORY OF LIFE'S MECHANISM. physiology of man and his allies than any other animals. The reason for this is plain enough. In the first place, there is a value in the knowledge of the life activities of man entirely apart from any theoretical aspects, and hence human physiology has demanded atten- tion for its own sake. The practical utility of human physiology has stimulated its study for centuries*; and in the last fifty years of scien- tific progress it has been human physiology and that of allied animals that has attracted the chief attention of physiologists. The result is that while the physiology of man is tolerably well known, that of other animals is less under- stood the further we get away from man and his allies. For this reason most of our knowledge of the living body as a machine must he derived from the study of man. This is, how- ever, fortunate rather than otherwise. In the ' first place, it enables us to proceed from the ! known to the unknown; and in the second place, more interest attaches to the problem as connected with human physiology than along any other line. In our discussion, therefore, we shall refer chiefly to the physiology of man. If we find that the functions of human life are amenable to a mechanical explanation we cannot hesitate to believe that this will be equally true of the lower orders of nature. For similar reasons little reference will be made to the mechanism of plant life. The structure of the plant is simpler and its activities are much more easily referable to mechanical principles than are those of animals. For these reasons it will

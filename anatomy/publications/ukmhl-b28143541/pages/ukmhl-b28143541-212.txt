208 THE STORY OF LIFEâ€™S MECHANISM. of building this primitive living machine, the cell. It is useless to try to go further at present. The origin of living matter is shrouded in as great obscurity as ever. We must admit that the disclosures of the modern microscope have complicated rather than simplified this problem. While a few years ago chemists and biologists were eagerly expecting to discover a method of manufacturing a bit of living matter by artificial means, that hope has now been practically abandoned. The task is apparently hopeless. We can manipulate chemical forces and produce an endless series of chemical compounds. But we cannot manipulate the minute bits of matter which make up the living machine. Since living matter is made of the adjustment of these micro- scopic parts of matter, we cannot hope to make a bit, of living matter until we find some way of making these little parts and adjusting them together. Most students of protoplasm have therefore abandoned all expectation of making even the simplest living thing. We are appar- ently as far from the real goal of a natural explanation of life as we were before the dis- covery of protoplasm. GENERAL SUMMARY. It is now desirable to close this discussion of seemingly somewhat unconnected topics by bringing them together in a brief summary. This will enable us to see more clearly the position in which science stands to-day upon

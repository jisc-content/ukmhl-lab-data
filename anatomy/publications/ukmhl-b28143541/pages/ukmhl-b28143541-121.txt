117 THE CELL AND PROTOPLASM. nected by the spindle fibres. Meantime the menibrane around the nucleus has disappeared, and thus the spindle fibres readily penetrate into the nuclear substance (Fig. 30). During this time the chromosomes have been changing their position. Whether this change in position is due to forces within themselves, or whether they are moved around passively by forces residing in the cell substances, or whether which IS the most probable, they are pulled or pushed around by the spindle fibres which are forcing their way into the nucleus, is not posi- tively known; nor is it, for our purposes, of special importance. At all events, the result IS that when the asters have assumed their position at opposite poles of the nucleus the chromosomes are arranged in a plane passing through the middle of the nucleus at equal distances from each aster. It seems certain that they are pulled or pushed into this position by forces radiating from the centrosomes. Fig. 30 shows this central arrangement of the chromo- somes, forming what is called the equcdorial plate. The next step is the most significant of all. ^ consists in the splitting of each chromosome into two equal halves. The threads do not divide in their middle hut split lengthwise, so that there are formed two halves identical in every respect. In this way are produced twice the original number of chromosomes, but all in pairs. The period at which this splitting of the chromosomes occurs IS not the same in all cells. It may occur, as described, at about the time the asters

616 TESTICLE like tlie straight tubules which open into them, are lined with cubical or flattened cells. The seminiferous tubules {tubuli contorti) are of fairly large diameter (0*2 mm.) and very long in proportion, a single tubule isolated after maceration in Fig. 895.—Section of the tube op the epididymis.

There are altogether between 800 and 900 tubules in the testis (Laiith). In spite of the comparative facility with which they may be unravelled it has not been definitely determined whether they anastomose at their peripheral ends, or whether they begin with blind Fig. 896.—Cells of epididymis, showing canalisation of the cytoplasm.

Eberth ^ was not able to find a single anastomosis, but was equally unsuccessful in finding any blind endings to the tubules. Their total combined length has been estimated at from 650 to 800 metres. Some of them show bulgings 1 ‘ Dio miinnlichen Geschlechtsorgane ’ in v. Bardeleben’s Handbuch, 1904.

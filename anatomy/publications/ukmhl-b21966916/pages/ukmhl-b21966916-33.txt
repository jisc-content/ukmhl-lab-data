13 PROPERTIES OP COLLOID SOLUTIONS Ejects of stroin and stress in colloid solutions.—It has been observed by Biitschli,* Hardy,'■' and others, that if during the jnocess of coagulation by fixatives a film of colloid solution is subjected to strain in definite directions, the effect shows itself along definite paths (lines of Fig 10.—Lines of stkess in a netwokk OF INDIABUBBER THREADS DRAWN TOGETHER AT TWO POINTS, SHOWING THE FORMATION OF A SPINDLE BETWEEN THE POINTS OF TRACTION.

This observation is highly instructive with reference to the ‘ stress ’ appearances which are observable -A Fig. 12a.—Lines of stress in a magnetic FIELD. (Verworn, after Rhumbler.)

43 CELL-DIVISION Fig. 76 [continued].â€”Furtheb stages in the transformation op the chromatin of NUCLEI OP EPITHELIUM-CELLS OF SALAMANDER LARVA, LEADING TO THE FORMATION OP DAUGHTER-NUCLEI. (M. Heidenhain.) 5. The split chromosomes are beginning to become arranged around the equator of the spindle (the spindle is not shown in any of these figures). 6. Equatorial arrangement of chromosomes ; one chromosome is dislocated. T.'The split chromosomes are in two groups which have passed towards the poles of the division-spindle to form the daughter-nuclei. 8. Com- pletion of the process; the daughter-nuclei are now distinct from one another, the cell- substance (not here shown) having also undergone division. Notice that the chromosomes within the daughter-nuclei show chromatin particles, and that a chromatin network is becoming formed by lateral outgrowths from these particles.

THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES 122 in number. The so-called jelly-like eonneeiive tissue which is thus produced consists therefore, if this view of its development is correct, mainly of ground- substance. But there appears to be some doubt whether the vitreous humour is not a product rather of ectoderm than of mesoderm. In that case it would, like the reticular tissue of the thymus, require to be removed from the list of connective tissues. Connective tissue is readily regenerated, although the new cicatricial tissue which is formed in place of that which has been removed by the knife or by disease is not always obviously of the same character, either as regards its cells or fibres, as the tissue it replaces. It was believed by Cohnheim, whose views were supported by the experiments of Ziegler, that the new tissue was formed by the leucocytes of the granulation-tissue which first appears in the wound. On the other hand, it is affirmed by other observers that the leucocytes, although unquestionably precursors of the newly forming tissue, do not take any direct part in its formation, but are gradually supplanted by cells of the surrounding connective tissue which, after undergoing multiplication, wander into the space within which the new tissue is to become formed, and become the active agents for the production of the cicatricial tissue.^ SPECIAL VARIETIES OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE. RETIFORM OR RETICULAR TISSUE. This is a variety of connective tissue which is met with in various parts of the body, constituting the main part of the framework of many organs and entering largely into the constitution of mucous membranes and of most glands.

54G SMALL liSTESTINE The simple tubular g-lands of the intestine or crypts of Iiieberkuhn are formed by invagination of the general surface of the mucous membrane, and dip into its thickness. The invagination carries with it the layer of epithelium. Between the glands is the reticular tissue of the mucous membrane, containing many lymph-corpuscles (fig. 795); this tissue is condensed into a basement-membrane for each gland. The epithelium-cells of the glands arc villi crypts of Lieberkiilin muscularis mucosae glands of Brunner in submucosa circular muscular layer intermuscular layer longitudinal muscular layer serous coat Fig. 790.—Section of duodenum of cat. (Schiifer.) Magnified about 60 diameters. of the same character as those covering the general surface of the intestine. The invagination is slightly enlarged at the blind end (fundus), and here, in the small intestine of some animals, including man, occur special cells with distinct secretion-granules, first described by Paneth, and known by his name.^ Most of ^ According to S. Klein (Amer. Journ. Anat. 190(‘>) the granule-containing cells are not found in carnivora, but are present in insectivora. The granules are not mucinogen, as Bizzozero had supposed to be tlic case.

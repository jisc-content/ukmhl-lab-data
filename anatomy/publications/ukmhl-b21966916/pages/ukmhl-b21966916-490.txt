Fig. 655.—Skction op epidermis of cat’s foot showing fibrils bridging across the INTERCELLULAR SPACES OP THE RETE MUCOSUM. ThE DENTICULATIONS OF THE DEEPEST LAYER ARE ALSO SHOWN. (KoloSSOW.) Immediately above the stratum granulosum is a clear-looking layer in which the outlines of the cells are somewhat indistinct. This layer, which is not always Fig. 656.—From a section of the rete mucosum of the epidermis showing fibrils PASSING FROM CELL TO CELL ACROSS THE INTERCELLULAR SPACES. (Ranvier.) a cell-nucleus; /,/, fibrils. sharply marked off from the one superficial to it, has been termed stratum lucidum (fig. 654), and may be looked upon as transitional between the Malpighian and the horny layer of the epidermis. Its cells are not keratinised and the eleidin within

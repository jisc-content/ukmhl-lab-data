THE BLOOD 388 absorption of tissues which are undergoing degeneration and disintegration (Metschnikoff).' Leucocytes are classified according to the special characters of their granules and the nature of their cyto- plasm and nuclei, thus : ^ 1. Polymorphocytes (polymorphous leuco - cytes).-^—These (fig. 579, a) are characterised by their relatively large amount of clear, highly amoeboid proto- plasm and the presence of a deeply lobed, or more com- monly a multifid nucleus, the several parts of which look at first sight like so many smaller nuclei (fig. 581), although really united by fine threads of chromatin. They measure, when in the spherical con- dition, about *01 mm. (lOp.). The protoplasm contains very fine neutrophil or oxyphil granules,"^ staining with eosin. According to Phear they constitute 54 per cent, of the whole number of leuco- cytes. Carstanjen gives the percentage as from 57 to 69 in the adult, less in the child. The number is diminished after a meal. They are stated to be far more numerous imme- diately after birth than just before birth (in the rabbit).^ In the dog and cat they are relatively more numerous than in man (70 to 90 per cent., Sherrington ; 75 per cent., Davis and Carlson). Similar cells are found in bone-marrow, and it is considered probable by many authors that the polymorpho- cytes of the blood are produced there. The polymorphocytes are highly amoeboid (fig. 581) and phagocytic, and will continue for months to exhibit amoeboid movement if the blood is preserved aseptically (J. Jolly).® ^ Hamburger finds that phagocytosis is markedly in- creased by minute amounts of calcium (Trans. Internat. Congress of Physiology, Zentralbl. f. Physiol, xxiv. 1910) or of substances, such as chloroform, which have a solvent action on lipoids (K. Akad. Wetensch. Amsterdam, 1911). ^ On the classification and numeration of leucocytes see Ehrlich, Arch. f. (Anat. u.) Physiol. 1879, and Zeitschr. f. klin. Med. i. 1880; Gulland, Laboratory Reports of the R.

Untouched photograph. The nucleus at first sight appears multiple, but on careful examination its several parts seem to be united by threads of basichromatin. These cannot all be seen in the figure, in which only one plane of the thickness of the corpuscle is shown.

315 CEREBRAL CORTEX (fig. 487), occipital lobe (fig. 488)—are noteworthy by reason of the fact that great numbers of small nerve-cells (‘ granules ’) are seen forming either one or two strata between those formed by the pyramidal cells. This is especially the case in the visual and auditorv areas of the cortex, and it is amongst these ‘ granules that Fig. 489. — Pakt of a section of post- CENTBAL GYRUS ^ OF MAN. Nissl method. (Cajal.) The section includes some of the large pyra- mid-cells, and part of the layer of small nerve cells or granules, which exhibit different forms as illustrated by a, b, c, and cl.

The olfactory area (hippocampal region) shows peculiarities of structure even more marked than those of the other sensory areas (fig. 490). It is on the whole simpler ^ This region probably subserves tactile sensibility.

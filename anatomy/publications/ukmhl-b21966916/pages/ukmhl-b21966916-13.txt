PEE FACE The present part of Quainâ€™s Anatomy is intended to serve as a Text-book OF Microscopic Anatomy. With this view, the subject-matter has been re-arranged and re-written, and a large number of new figures added. Many are original, the rest are from various sources. Acknowledgment is due to the authors and publishers who have given consent to the use of their illustrations, and especially to Professor J. Sobotta, who has permitted a number of his coloured figures of human tissues and organs to be reproduced for this work in the form of lithographic plates ; to these have been added other coloured plates of drawings by Mr. Richard Muir, from specimens furnished by the author. The wealth of illustration provided by these and by the numerous text-figures will, it is hoped, add to the interest as well as to the value of the work. The chapter dealing with the structure of the Vascular System is by Professor G. Mann of Tulane University, New Orleans. The Index has been prepared by Dr. John Tait of Edinburgh University, who has also assisted in reading the proofs. E. A. SCHAFER. Edinburgh : March 1912.

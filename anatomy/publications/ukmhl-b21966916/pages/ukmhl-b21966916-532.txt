488 MOUTH their place is taken by other cells which are supplied by mitotic division of the cells of the deeper layers, the newly formed cells pushing those previously formed towards the surface. In many parts, especially at the back of the mouth, leucocytes are found between the epithelium-cells. The corium projects everywhere into the stratified epithelium in the form of microscopic papillae (fig. 703), most of which contain vascular loops, while some are provided with end-bulbs. The papillae are longer and better marked in the mucous membrane at the margins of the lips (fig. 704) than elsewhere. Lymph- vessels are also seen within the papillae ; they pass into a superficial plexus in Fig. 708.—Papillary surface op the tongue, with the fauces and tonsils. (Sappey.) 1, 2, circumvallate papillae ; behind 2, the foramen caecum; 3, fungiform papillae ; 4, filiform and conical papillae ; 5, transverse and oblique ranges; 6, mucous glands and lymphoid follicles at the base of the tongue and in the fauces; 7, tonsils; 8, tip of the epiglottis; 9, median glosso-epiglottic fold of the frenum epiglottidis. the mucous membrane, from which the lymph is conveyed by valved vessels seated in the submucous tissue. Small racemose mucous glands (fig. 705) are found everywhere under the mucous membrane. They are named labial, buccal, molar, &c., according to their situation, and have the usual structure of such glands (see p. 427). THE TONGUE. The substance of the tongue is chiefly composed of muscular fibres running in different directions (figs. 706, 707). Many of them are attached to the mucous membrane, especially of the dorsal surface and tip. ZUEucous membrane of the tong'ue.—The mucous membrane of the tongue resembles that of the mouth generally, and like that is covered by stratified ej)i- thelium. It is loosely connected with the muscular substance on the sides and under part, where its surface is smooth ; but is closely attached over the upper

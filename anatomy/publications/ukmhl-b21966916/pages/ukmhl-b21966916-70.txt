50 CELL-DIVISION sides of a group of such ‘ chromosome models/ the latter tend to arrange themselves equatorially in a manner roughly similar to the equatorial arrangement of the chromosomes in karyokinesis. For explaining the further movements of the chromosomes after their si)litting we should have Pig. 85.—Heterotypical (I.) and homotypical (II.) mitosis of the generative CELL. (Flemming.) The asterisk marks the middle, the cross the end of a chromosome. The changes are to be compared with those shown in fig. 83. In the hetero- typical form the chromosomes are already arranged in pairs before division com- mences ; this condition (geminal condition, A) having been produced in the synaj)tic prophase. A longitudinal split is seen in the diaster stage and the daughter-nuclei have the somatic number of chromosomes (8 in this instance). In the homotyiiical form there is no longitudinal split of the V-shaped chromo- somes (which are, however, arranged in pairs), and the separation to form the daughter-nuclei results in a reduction to one-half the somatic number. to suppose that the electrical charge, either of the split chromosomes or of the poles of the spindle, becomes changed in character. The phenomena shown in Leduc’s experiment are also probably brought about by the elec- trical charges of the electrolytes in the solutions employed (Rhumbler).

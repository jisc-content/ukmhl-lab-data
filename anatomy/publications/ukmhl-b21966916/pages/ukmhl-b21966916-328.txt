NERVE-ENDINGS 292 of the retina (nerve-fibre layer). The fibres of the nerve-fibre layer, which in the retina itself are non-medullated, become collected at the colliculus {oftic Fig. 463.—Diagbam of the connexions of THE KETINAL ELEMENTS. (G. Retzius.) gr.i., inner granules (bipolars); vi.i., inner molecular layer; g, cell of ganglionic layer; 11, nerve-fibre process passing towards brain. disc) or entrance of optic nerve (really the exit of the nerve-fibres) into a mass of fibres, circular in section. These fibres pierce the coats of the eyeball, in a number of bundles which receive strong sheaths from its outer- most tunic, which also gives a general invest- ment for the whole (optic) nerve as it leaves the globe of the eye. The fibres are conveyed along the optic nerves and optic tracts to the optic thalami (lateral geniculate bodies) and to the anterior corpora quadrigemina, where their axons end by arborising amongst the nerve-cells there situated. The nervous elements proper of the retina (nerve-cells and their processes) are supported by a framework formed from certain cells which appear to be derived from the spongioblasts of the embryonic nervous system, and are perhaps homologous with the ependyma-cells of the adult brain and spinal cord (see p. 203). These cells take the form of elongated structures—the fibres of Muller (fig. 462, J)—which extend from the inner surface of the retina (where the base of the cell is represented by a Fig. 464.—Section of ketina of man passing thbough centkal fovea.

GOBLET-CELLS 89 swollen part of in size, formed of them,' and they extend also into the enlarged mouths or ducts of the gastric glands. In shape they are usually columnar, but as the mucin accumulates within them the part of the cell nearest the free surface becomes out by it, whilst the fixed the cell tends to diminish and the nucleus becomes pushed down towards the basement- membrane upon which the cells are fixed. The secretion in these cells, as in all other secreting cells, makes its appearance in the form of granules (fig. 146), which are at first small and stain in much the same manner as the granules which are found in nearly all protoplasm. But presently the granules increase in size, and perhaps in number, and begin to take up stains which have a special affinity for mucin.

46 CELL-JJIVISION division by themselves first dividing. This plane of beaded enlargements is the division-'plane and the enlargements form collectively the equatorial plate (fig. 80) ; but this is absent in the division of most animal cells, the protoplasm of which seems as a rule to divide by a pinching-in or constriction which begins at the surface and gradually reaches the centre of the elongated cell. But the gap between these Fig. 78.â€”Diagram showing the changes which occur in the centrosomes and NUCLEUS of a cell IN THE PROCESS OF MITOTIC DIVISION. The nucleus is supposed to have four chromosomes. remains for a time bridged across by fibrils which are the remains of the equatorial part of the division-spindle, and there is often to be seen in the middle of the bridge a particle (fig. 81) which may be distinctively stained and perhaps represents the equatorial plate seen in other dividing cells.^ This particle is the intermediate corpuscle of Flemming.

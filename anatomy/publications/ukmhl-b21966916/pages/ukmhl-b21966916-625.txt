BILE-CANALICULI 569 injection-material from the blood-vessels into the cells was noticed in the frog by J. H. and E. H. Fraser in 1895.’ Bile-canallculi.—The external secretion—the bile—issues from the cells by a special path. Everywhere between the cells, on the sides which are not in con- tact with the blood-channels, fine canals—the bile-canaliculi—penetrate, enclosing the cells within the meshes of a network of minute tubules which penetrate to all parts of the lobule (figs. 831, 832). Fig. 831.—Section of a livek-lobule with the blood-vessels and ducts injected. (Cadiat.) h, h, interlobular veins; a, intralobular vein; c, interlobular bile-ducts, with which the bile canaliculi from the lobule are connected. The canaliculi have only become injected in the peripheral parts of the lobule. The canaliculi may be shown by injecting the bile-ducts, and also by introducing sulph- indigotate of soda into the blood and after a certain lapse of time killing the animal and examining the liver, since this colouring-matter is secreted with the bile. But the most ready way to exhibit the canaliculi is by treating small portions of liver by the Golgi chromate-of-silver method.- At the surface of the lobules the bile-canals are larger and are surrounded by cubical epithelium-cells, which on the one hand merge into the columnar cells lining the interlobular bile-ducts, and on the other are continuous with the cells of the liver-lobule. In this way the bile is conducted from all parts of the lobule to its periphery and passes there into the interlobular ducts ; these convey it towards the ^ Journ.

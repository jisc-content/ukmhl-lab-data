Amongst the gland-alveoli are seen conspicuous bundles of the olfactory nerve-fibres, which are passing from the olfactory cells in the mucous membrane towards the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Although the gland- Fig. 703.—Section of mucous membrane prom the back of the mouth (rabbit). (Schafer.) Magnified 240 diameters. Photograph.

Here and there patches of ciliated epithelium may be seen in the olfactory region ; the glands which open on to such patches are always mucous glands.

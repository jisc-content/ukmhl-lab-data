OVARY 652 In the largest follicles both discus proligerus and membrana granulosa are many layers thick, and are composed mainly of spherical or polyhedral cells somewhat loosely connected together near the liquor folliculi, within which many of them undergo disintegration; they are more closely packed nearer the ovum and the wall of the follicle respectively. The cells which cover the ovum and those which actually line the follicular wall are columnar in shape, and, as already noticed, those which immediately surround the ovum send fine prolongations of their protoplasm through the pores of the zona radiata. Those Graafian follicles that attain maturity and burst become developed into corpora lutca, a description of the formation of which will immediately be given. But a very large Fig. 949.—Figubes showing vakious stages in the development op the Gkaafian FOLLICLES IN THE BABBIT. (Schiifer.) Highly magnified. A, From a section of the ovary of a young rabbit, showing the ‘ egg-tubes ’ of Pfliiger continuous with the germinal epithelium of the surface. Some of the egg-tubes contain primitive ova. B, primitive Graafian follicles derived from the breaking up of an egg-tube. C, a Graafian follicle within which the permanent ovum has now become distinct. The follicle has only a single layer of epithelium. D, a larger follicle in which there are two distinct layers of epithelium, but the inner layer is formed of flattened cells. E, a larger but still quite young follicle in which the inner layer of cells as well as the outer is composed of columnar epithelium. Figs. B, C, D, and E are taken from sections of ovaries more advanced in development than A.

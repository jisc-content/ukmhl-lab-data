G48 OVAKY membrane an appearance of radial striation. It is known as the zona radiata or zona 'pellucida (v. Baer), the latter term being derived from its appearance in the fresh condition (fig. 941). It is possessed of considerable toughness and requires a considerable amount of pressure to rupture it. » o*«oO Fig. 940.—A modeeately lakge graafian follicle from the human ovary, showing OVUM SURROUNDED BY ‘DISCUS PEOLIGEEUS ’ AND WALL OF FOLLICLE LINED BY ‘ MEM- BRANA GRANULOSA.’ BETWEEN THEM IS AN ACCUMULATION OF LIQUOR FOLLICULI. (Sellheim.) Fig. 941.—Ovarian ovum of a mammal. (Allen Thomson.) a, an entire ovum, viewed under pressure; the granular cells have been removed from the outer surface, the germinal vesicle is seen within the yolk-substance; b, the external coat or zona burst by increased pressure, the yolk-proto- plasm and the germinal vesicle having escaped; c, germinal vesicle more freed from the yolk-sub- stance. In all the three figures macula is shown. Fig. 942.—Ovum of a mammal, highly magnified. semi-diagramm.\tic. (Schiifer.) 0p,zona pellucida, showing radiated struc- ture ; vi, vitellus, round which a delicate membrane is seen; gv, germinal vesicle ; gs, germinal spot. Within the zona the ovum consists of cytoplasm {vitellus or yolk) containing numerous yolk-granules (fig. 942), which are especially abundant in the central parts; the superficial layer may be clear of them. Amongst them lies the nucleus (germinal vesicle of Purkinje), which measures about 0'05 mm. in diameter; it has a prominent

NERVE-ENDINGS IN TENDONS 277 are doubtless of a sensory nature, for nerve excitation is not found to have any influence on the action of cilia. Special modifications of the plexiform mode of ending of sensory nerves exist in various peripheral organs, amongst which the endings in tendons and muscles may be particularly described. Nerve-ending's in tendons.— Most of the nerve-endings in tendons seem referable to one or other of the end-organs which have already been described, although they present con- siderable modification of form.

(Cecclierelli.) a, nerve-fibre with bederiform ending; b, a. fibre terminating in an end-bulb; c, nerve-fibres ending in close ramifications at the base of a double papilla ; v, blood-vessels.

II, nerve-fibre ; m, terminal menisci or tactile discs ; e, ordinary epithelium-cell; a, altered epithelium-cell, to which the meniscus is applied. some tendons end-bulbs like those in the conjunctiva are found, and small Pacinian corpuscles of simple structure occur occasionally in the areolar tissue sheaths of tendons and ligaments. But in many tendons, at their junction with the muscles, there occur, as was first shown by Golgi in 1878,' long spindle-shaped bodies composed of a number of tendinous bundles more or less fused, into which one or more medullated fibres pass. After dividing a certain number of times, their axis-cylinders spread themselves out between the smaller * Gesammelte Unters. 1894 ; see also Ciaccio, Arch. ital. de biol. xiv. 1891.

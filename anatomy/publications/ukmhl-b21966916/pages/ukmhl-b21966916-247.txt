SYNAPSES 215 certain cells and cell-groups only are aft'ected by a resulting process of degeneration. Such degeneration is confined to the limits of the cells and cell-groups affected; although it includes all their processes, however remote, it does not extend beyond BETWEEN AXONS AND DENDBONS IN THE BETINA.

Or the axon of one nerve-cell may form a closely ramified interlacement of fibrils with similarly ramified fibrils derived from the dendrons of other nerve-cells (fig. 328, b, and fig. 330). Or, again, but more cell may ramify around the cell-body of another cell (fig. 327) or around its dendrons (fig. 329). These ^ Cf. Max Verworn, Das Neuron, Jena, 1900; L. L.

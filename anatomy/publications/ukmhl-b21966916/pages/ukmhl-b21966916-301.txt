rOEPUSCLES OF PACINI. 267 of the internal structure of these bodies, and to clearly demonstrate their essential connexion with nerve-fibres. The corpuscles in question are, as already said, attached in numbers to the branches of the nerves of the hand and foot (fig. 420), and here and there they Fig. 420.—A nebve of the MIDDLE FINGER, WITH PaCINI-\N BODIES ATTACHED.

They have been discovered also within the abdomen on the nerves of the solar plexus, and on those of the parietal perito- neum. ‘ They are nowhere more distinctly seen or more conveniently ob- tained for examination than in the mesentery of the cat, between the layers of which they exist abun- dantly. They have been found on the pudic nerves in the penis and clitoris, in the bulb and other parts of the urethra, on the inter- costal nerves, sacral plexus, cutaneous nerves of the upper arm and neck, nerves of the nipple and mammary gland, and on the infra- orbital nerve.

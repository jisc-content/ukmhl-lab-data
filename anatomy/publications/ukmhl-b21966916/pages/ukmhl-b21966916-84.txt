64 VITAL PHENOMENA OF PROTOPLASM vessels are known as ‘ wander cells/ and the passage through the vascular wall is known as ‘ diapedesis.’ Although probably occurring to a certain extent normally, it is greatly increased in inflammatory conditions of the tissues. Varieties of pseudopodia.—The pseudopodia of leucocytes, which are the characteristic amoeboid cells of the blood and lymph and of certain tissues, such as the marrow, spleen, and Fig, 103.—Photogbaph of an amoeboid leucocyte of Tbiton fixed by a jet of steam AND STAINED WUTH H.EMATOXYLIN. (Schiifer.) Magnified 1360 diameters. The nucleus at first sight appears multiple, but on careful examination its several parts are united by threads of basi-chromatin. These cannot all be seen in the figure, which is a reproduction from an untouched negative, in which only one plane of the thickness of the corpuscle is photographed. lymphatic glands, are usually broad projections from the general surface similar to those of Amoeba proteus or Amoeba limax (fig, 99). Such pseudopodia have been called lobed to distin- guish them from the more pointed or even spine-like processes which are occasionally seen in leucocytes, characteristically in certain of those of Triton (fig. 101), and in some A B < mg.

Amoebae (A. diffluens, fig. 104), and from the dendritically branched amoeboid processes, such as occur in the pigment-cells of Amphibia (fig. 105), as well as from the long fine filiform pseudopodia which are characteristic of the Heliozoa and allied Radiolarian animalcules (fig. 106). In the last-named the protrusion and retraction of the pseudopodia is very slow and the processes frequently fuse with one another. Moreover, these long filiform pseudopodia generally

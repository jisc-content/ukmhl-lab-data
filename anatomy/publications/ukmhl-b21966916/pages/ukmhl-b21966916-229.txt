199 CAEDIAC MUSCLE The former view is that which was taken by Schweigger-Seidel,^ and is founded upon tlie fact that by various methods of staining, and especially by nitrate of silver, there are distinct indi- cations of transverse septa across the fibres, each inter- septal space having as a rule a nucleus somewhere near its centre (fig. 303). Moreover, by treatment with certain reagents {e.g. 33 per cent, caustic potash solution) the fibres tend to break up into iminucleated portions which correspond with the heart muscle-cells of Schweigger- Seidel (fig. 302). On the other hand there is evidence that the muscle - fibrils are con- tinued across the septa and therefore pass from cell to cell (figs. 305, 306). Continuity of fibrils is also strik- ingly shown in the fibres of Purkinje which occur in the heart of the sheep and ox in certain parts of the myocar- dium near the endocardium Fig. 305.—Heart muscle-fibres showing transverse (fig. 307).

But on observing more they are not separate from one another, but are intimately united by cross-striated fibrils which occupy their periphery, and ^ Strieker’s Plandb. d. Gewebelehre, 1869.

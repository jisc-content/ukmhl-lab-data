Such glands as Bensley describes belong, however, to the same category as the glands of the fundus (see below). The true cardiac glands have no parietal cells, and according to the observations of Haane and of Ellenberger and Hofmeister (in the pig) these glands do not yield pepsin, but an amylolytic 708.

Schaher has described similar glands in the lowest part of the msophagus of man. The glands of the cardia were first described by Schafer and Williams (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1870) in the kan- oaroo, where they are simple tnbnles . mibsequently by Ellenberger in a number of animals.

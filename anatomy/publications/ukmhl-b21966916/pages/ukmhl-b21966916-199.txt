171 (OSSIFICATION of the excised humerus of a child by the introduction, at successive periods, of portions of fresh bone removed from another patient.' Historical.— It was long supposed that all the bones of the skeleton were preceded by and deposited in cartilage. Nesbitt, however, showed in 1730 that some of the flat bones were formed independently of cartilage, and he further maintained that the cartilage is ‘ entirely destroyed ’ ; he therefore considered it to be a mere temporary substitute; but the steps of the process of intracartilaginous ossification as now traced with the aid of the microscope were unknown to him, and it was not until the 3'ear 1845 that the manner of formation of bone and the extensive replacement of the primarily ossified cartilage by new bone formed in membrane was made clear by the researches of Sharpey, who published the results of his work in the fifth edition of Quain’s Anatomy.

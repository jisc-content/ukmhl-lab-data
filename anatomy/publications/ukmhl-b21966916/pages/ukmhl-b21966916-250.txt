NERVE-CELLS 218 cell and its processes^ The fibrils are said to vary in size according to the functional condition of the nerve-cell. Thus they are described by Cajal and Tello as being thicker and less numerous in the hibernating lizard during the winter sleep (fig. 336, B,C), and finer and more numerous during activity (fig. 336, A,D). It is commonly assumed that the fibrils are the essentially conducting part of the nervous element, but this is not easy of proof, and the opposite view was taken by Leydig,^ Fig. 336.—Fibbils within nebve-cells. (Cajal and Tello.) who held that the interfibrillar substance is the true conducting material of nerve- fibres. Nor is it clear whether the fibrils are solid threads or hollow tubules occu- pied by fluid : this question will be discussed later (p. 235). In some invertebrates (Apathy it appears as if the neuro-fibrils may extend through two or more nerve- cells without interruption ; this fact has been employed to throw doubt upon the doctrine of separate nerve-units. Similar conditions have been de- scribed by Bethe in vertebrates, but the evidence is not convincing. And even if such continuity of nerve-fibrils from cell to cell were found to be general, the fact that the direct trophic influence of the nucleus and cell-bodv is confined to sJ the limits of its own cell-processes, and does not extend to those of other nerve-cells (see pp. 214, 215), sufficiently indicates that, from the point of view of nutrition at any rate, the doctrine of independent units must be looked upon as established. An internal reticulum unconnected with the neuro-fibrils and similar in character to that which has been found to be present in certain other cells (p. 25) 1 Cf. Jiiderholin, Arch. f. mikr. Anat.

GENERAL .STRUCTURE OF TISSUES () Under these circumstances a fine deposit of reduced silver is produced in all inter- cellular substance, which shows brown or even nearly black in consequence, thus contrasting with the material of which the cells themselves are composed, which Fig. 7.—Abeolar tissue prepared by Recklinghausen’s silver method, (Schafer.) Photograph : magnified 200 diameters. The cells are seen as clear spaces in the (brown) stained ground-substance, through which the fibres course. Fig. 8.—Section of white fibro-cartilage. (Schafer.)

See also the plate opposite p. 102).^ Under the agency of the cells, fibres of various kinds may be formed within intercellular ' A. S. Dogiel (Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xxxiii. 1889) has shown that a similar effect—i.r. staining of intercellular substance alone—may be obtained by impregnating a tissue with strong solution of methylene blue and afterwards washing in diluted picrate of ammonia.

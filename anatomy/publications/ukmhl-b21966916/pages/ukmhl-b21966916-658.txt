KIDNEY 600 The first convoluted tubule is about 50 m in outside diameter, the second convoluted tubule somewhat smaller ; the descending limb of Henle’s looped tubule about 15 /u, the ascending limb nearly twice this size. The straight or collecting tubules are from 18 ju to 50 the larger being nearest the papilla ; the ducts of Bellini may measure as much as 300 /u. The Malpighian corpuscles vary in size ; in man corpuscles from 150 to 200 jjt. occur in the same kidney. The lumen of the tubules varies not only with their outside diameter but also inversely as the thickness of their epithelial lining. Thus the relatively fine descending parts of the looped tubules of Henle have nearly as large a lumen as the far thicker ascending parts. The zigzag M m.r.

The lumen of the convoluted tubules varies in different kidneys and in different parts of the same kidney ; the secreting epithelium-cells which line them being sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. These differences may represent variations in secretory activity; it is found that in the kidneys of animals which are hibernating— and which are therefore inactive—the cells of the convoluted tubules are usually long and the lumen is almost obliterated. This condition probably represents the resting state of the epithelium.* On the other hand, the state of activity is probably represented by a dome-like swelling of the inner zone of the epithelium-cell; this swelling contains a centrosome or diplosome, and from this Disse, article ‘ Harnorgane ’ in v.

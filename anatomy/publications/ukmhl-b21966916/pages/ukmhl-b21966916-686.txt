PENIS 628 sebaceous and sweat glands, the latter smaller than ordinary. On the inner side of the prepuce the integument changes its character, and approaches that of a mucous membrane, being red, thin, and moist. In man it contains no glands. Fig. 915.—Transvebse section of the body OF THE PENIS IN THE DISTENDED STATE. (Altered from Henle.) The outer outline indicates the integument surrounding the deeper parts; the erectile tissues of the corpora cavernosa and the septum pectiniforme are shown in section ; it, placed on the section of the spongy body below the urethra ; D, the single dorsal vein; a, the dorsal artery, and n, the nerve of one side. although Tyson described in the orang glands round the corona glandis (glandulce odoriferce), and in some other animals racemose glands yielding a sebaceous secretion occur within the prepuce. The skin which covers the surface of the glans contains no glands. It is beset under the epithelium with large vascular and nervous papillae. It adheres in- timately and immovably to the spongy tissue of the glans. In some individuals the skin of the glans is roughened by papillary projections, especially at the corona ; in others the surface is smooth. Beneath the skin on the body of the penis is a layer continuous with the dartos scroti. Like that it contains plain muscle- fibres ; these diminish in number distally, but occur even as far as the extremity of the prepuce. The fibres have for the most part a circular direction. Under the tunica dartos the ordinary superficial c.c. C.C. Fig. 910.—Tbansyebse section of glans penis of child.

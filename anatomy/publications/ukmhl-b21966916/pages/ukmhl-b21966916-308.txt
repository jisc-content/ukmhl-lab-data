274 NERVE-ENDINGS between the different nerves which enter into the plexus, this union does not extend to the ultimate elements ; in other words, although fibres or parts of fibres (fibrils) may be given and received by the several nerves to and from one another, these fibres (in the case of the larger plexuses) or fibrils (in the microscopic plexuses) remain completely distinct, although they Pig. 431.—Neeve-fibbils passing to their terminations in the epithelium covering THE CORNEA.

Nervous plexuses are of very common occurrence, both those of the larger sort which have long been recognised by anatomists, and the smaller microscopic plexuses which are very often found near the endings, both of some centripetally conducting and of some centrifugally conducting nerves. Nervous networlcs are of less frequent occurrence. Fig. 432.—Ending of nerve-fibrils in a strati- fied EPITHELIUM (mSOPHAGUS OF RABBIT). (G.

(Dogiel.) and indeed their existence has been doubted altogether by some liistologists.* Recently, liow- cvcr, evidence has been accumulating in favour of the existence of a terminal network of neuro- fibrils from the same axis-cylinder, although networks formed by the union of branches of different axis-cylinders must still be considered as of doubtful occurrence. ^ Compare Waldeyer, Ue. d.

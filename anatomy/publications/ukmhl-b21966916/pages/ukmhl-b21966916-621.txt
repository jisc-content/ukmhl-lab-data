567 STKUCTURE OE LIVER-LOBULES capillaries enters portal vessels and ultimately goes to the lobules. But most of the blood carried by the hepatic artery is distributed directly by its interlobular Fig. 828.—Reticulum of a liver-lobule. c, central vein; i, interlobular interval. (Oppel.) branches to the capillary channels of the lobules (fig. 823), which are thus supplied with a certain proportion of arterial blood. The canals in the liver-substance in which run the branches of the portal vein, hepatiq artery, and bile-duct, surrounded by the loose connective tissue of the capsule of Glisson, are known as portal canals (figs. 819, 820). Each lobule represents a liver in miniature. It is composed of a mass of cells (fig. 827) supported by reticular connective tissue (fig. 828),' and is pierced everywhere by con- verging capillary blood-channels through which the blood courses but slowly. These blood-channels are not true capillaries, but sinusoids. They are not surrounded by con- nective tissue containing lymph-spaces, as are the capillaries of other glands, but are in direct contact with the liver-cells—from which they are separated at most by their lining endothelium. This is, however, in many places incomplete, and its cells are irregularly branched and more or less isolated from their fellows {stellate cells of Kufffer) ^ ; Fig. 829.—Section op liver op rabbit INJECTKD from THE PORTAL VEIN SHOW- ING INTKACELLULAR CANALICULI IN- .TECTED FROM THE INTERCELLULAR SINUSOIDS.

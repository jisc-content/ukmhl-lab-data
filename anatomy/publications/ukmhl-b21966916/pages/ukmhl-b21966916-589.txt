VILLI 589 square millimetre, and in the ileum from 8 to 14 in the same space. It is estimated that there are about four millions altogether (\V. Krause). Chaput describes the villi as being so closely arranged as to be separated merely by narrow clefts into which the crypts of Lieberkiihn open. This may be the case in the empty condition of the intestine, but when it is distended they are necessarily more sc])arated from one another, as usually described. Fig. 780.—Part of a section through a villus of the dog. (R. Heidenhain.) Highly magnified. m., plain muscle; Z., I"., leucocytes, which are seen in large numbers in the interstices of the reticular tissue ; i/., vessels ; c., connective-tissue cells, covering the fibrils of the reticulum. The epithelium of the villus is not represented. A villus consists of a prolongation of the proper mucous membrane. It is covered by columnar epithelium (fig. 779), and encloses a network of blood-vessels. Fig. 781.—Magnified view of the dlood-vessels of the intestinai. \illi. (Bharpey.) The drawing was taken from a preparation injected by Lieberkiihn, and shows, belonging to each villus, a small artery and vein with the intermediate capillary network. one or more lymphatic vessels (lactealsl, and a few longitudinal plain muscular fibres, these being all supported and held together by reticular tissue (fig. 780). Under the epithelium is a basement-membrane composed of a condensation of the reticular tissue covered by flattened cells; these cells are on the one hand connected

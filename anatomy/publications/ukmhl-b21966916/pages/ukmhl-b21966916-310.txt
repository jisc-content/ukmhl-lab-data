‘276 NERVE-ENDINGS in the immediate neighbourhood of the sweat-ducts (fig. 437), and in the mucous membrane of the tongue ; they may occur in these situations along with end-bulbs and other kinds of nerve-ending (fig. 438) ; and they are also found between the epithelial cells which constitute the outer root-sheath of certain of the hair- follicles of animals. In some other especially sensitive parts in animals the intra- Fict. 4oG.—Terminal arborisation from the superficial layer of the PEifiTO^’EUM of THE rabbit. Methylene-blue preparation. (Dogiel.)

This is the case in the epithelium covering the snout of the pig and some other mammals, where the branches of the axis-cylinders end in tactile menisci (fig. 439), which lie between some of the deeper cells (Ranvier). These menisci show a reticular structure (fig. 440). In the snout of the mole pencils of nerve-fibrils pass Fig. 437.—Hederiform nerye-endings in the cutis vera.

Nerve-endings in a terminal ramification of fibrils are found in simple epithelia as well as in stratified. They have been described as passing between the cells of columnar epithelium and are also found ramifying amongst ciliated cells.' These * A. Betlie, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xliv. 1895. The nerve-endings in several mucous membranes have been described by G. Retzius (Biol. Unters.); in the mouth by E. Botezat (Anat. Anz. xxxi. 1907) and Ceccherelli, Int. Monatschr. f. Anat. u. Physiol, xxv. 1909. Botezat has also made a renewed study of the endings in the epidermis (Anat. Anz. xxxiii. 1908).

130NE 150 (fig. 236, h). The lamellae are partly separated from one another by the lacunae which lie between them. Where these are absent they are joined together by the ground-substance ; they are also united by bundles of fibres passing obliquely from one lamella to the other.

These are actually bundles of fibres, but this is not shown in the drawing. Apertures through which perforating fibres had passed are seen especially in the lower part, a, a, of the figure. Magnitude as seen under a power of 200, but not drawn to a scale (from a drawing by Allen Thomson). de Burgh Birch' describes some of the lacunae as lying in the substance of the lamellae. Birch, however, defines a lamella as a layer of osseous substance in which the fibres course in the same direction. But this definition would in some cases comprise several lamellae as ordinarily understood (see fig. 236).

410 THE SPLEEN capillary have branching processes and are united by these with the branched 1 reticulum-cells of the pulp. In this manner the blood can flow directly into the Fig. 610.—Thin section of spleen-pulp of child, highly magnified, showing THE OEIGIN of A SMALL VEIN IN THE INTEBSTICES OF THE PULP. (Schafer.)

The veins, which form a network of intercommuni- cating sinus-like spaces within the pulp (fig. 613), commence in the same manner as the capillaries terminate (figs. 609, 610); that is to say, the layer of endothelium no longer forms a complete tube, but gaps are left between the cells, the si^e of these gaps doubtless varying with the state of distension of the organ. The endothelium- cells of the venous sinuses appear ribbed longitudinally with fibres derived from the reticulum (fig. 614). The cell-bodies with their nuclei project somewhat ^ into the lumen of the sinuses (fig. 615). In the human spleen, and in that of the monkey, the sinuses are encircled by ring-like anas- tomosing fibres (fig. 613) which are in continuity with the fibres of the pulp- reticulum, and according to S. Mollier the ring-fibres are conjoined to the longi- tudinal fibres just mentioned as producing a longitudinal ribbing on the endothelium; in this manner the reticulum of the pulp and the endothelial cells of the venous sinuses are intimately connected. The tissue of the pulp may be compared to a /.r=: Fig. 611.—A giant-cell fbom the spi.een OF A KITTEN. (Scliiifer.) Magnified 400 diameters.

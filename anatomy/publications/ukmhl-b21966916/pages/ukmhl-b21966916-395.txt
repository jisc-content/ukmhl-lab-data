.STRUCTURE OF LYMPFI-VE.S.SEL.S 359 a larger number of circular non-striped muscles than a vein of similar size, but not as many as are found in a corresponding artery. The tunica externa contains connective tissue and a few longitudinal elastic and muscle-fibres. Nerve- fibrils are abundantly supplied to lymph-vessels.^ Gaskell described an attachment of elastic fibres to the walls of smaller^lymphatics in some parts, and inferred that the patency of the lumen may by their means be restored after it has been temporarily obliterated by external pressure or by contraction of the muscular coat.

Here and there an isolated patch of similar cells is seen in the meshes of the network. The connective tissue cell-sj)aces are not represented. Valves.—The lymphatics and lacteals are furnished with valves serving the same office as those of the veins, and for the most part constructed after the same fashion. These generally consist of two semilunar folds arranged in the same way as in the already described valves of veins, but deviations from the ^ A. S. Dogiel, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xlix. 1897.

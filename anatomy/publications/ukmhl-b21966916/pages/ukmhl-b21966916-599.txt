549 LYMPH-FOLLICLES The ag*minated grlands or patches of Peyer (who described them in 1677) nre groups or patches of lymph-follicles. The groups have an oblong figure '(fig. 800), and vary from half an inch to two or even four inches in length and from half an inch to about an inch in width (12 mm. to 100 mm. long and 12 mm. to Fig. 800.— A small patch of Peyer’s glands from the ileum. (Boehm.) Slightly magnified. Fig. 801.—Blood-vessels of a Peyer’s patch. (Kblliker.) Magnified. The drawing was taken from a preparation made by Frey of the intestine of the rabbit. It represents the fine capillary network spreading from the surrounding blood- vessels into the interior of three lymph-follicles. 6/n - f Fig. 802.—Lymphatics of a Peyer’s patch. (Kblliker.) Silver-nitrate i^reparation. I, lymphatics of mucous membrane; s, sinus-like lymphatics surrounding lymph-follicle, /,/; sm, submucosa; m, muscular coat. 25 mm. broad). They are placed lengthways in the intestine at that part of the tube most distant from the mesentery ; hence, to obtain the best view of them, the bowel should be opened by an incision along its attached border.

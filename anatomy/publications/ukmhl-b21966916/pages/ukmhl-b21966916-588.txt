538, SMALL INTESTINE indistinct, somctiraes even acquiring a very oblique direction, they altogether disappear. The villi, peculiar to the small intestine, and giving to its internal surface the velvety appearance already spoken of, are small processes of the mucous membrane, which are closely set on every part of the inner surface, over the valvuhn conniventes, as well as between them. Their length varies from 0-5 mm. to 0-7 mm., or sometimes more. They are villi crypts of Lieberkiihn muscularis mucosa? submucosa layer of circular muscular fibres intermuscular layer layer of longitudinal muscular fibres serosa Fig. 779.—Section of jejunum oe cat paballel with the long axis oe the intestine.

According to Kauber, they are short and leaf-shaped in the duodenum, and as the gut is followed downwards they become gradually longer and thinner, being tongue-shaped in the jejunum, and filiform in the ileum.* Occasionally two or three are connected together at their liase. In the upper part of the small intestine there are from 10 to 18 villi in a ^ On modifications of the shape of the villi in animals, and its relation to the food, see Bujard, Vei’handl. d. Anat.

617 SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES and even lateral branches, but these are rare ; on the whole they have a uniform diameter and smooth contour. Each tubule is bounded by a relatively thick membranous wall (7-10 /x) com- Fig. 897.—Section of epithelium of vas effebens neak its junction with the EPIDIDYMIS. (Ebertli.)

The lamellae are formed partly of flattened cells, partly of connective-tissue ground-substance with numerous elastic fibres, arranged Fig. 898.—Passage of convoluted seminiferous tubules into straight tubules, and OF these into the rete testis.

The lamellae become more pronounced and their fibres more distinct as development proceeds. The innermost lamellae are very closely arranged, and

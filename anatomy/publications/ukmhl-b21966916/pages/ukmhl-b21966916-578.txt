Section of mucous membrane of fundus of dogâ€™s stomach, passing across the direction of the oxyntic glands. Haematoxylin-eosin. Magnified 250 diameters. (Schafer.) The section is somewhat oblique and shows at the upper part of the figure the ducts or mouths of the glands cut across and at the lower part the secreting tubules with central or chief and parietal or oxyntic cells; the latter coloured by eosin. The tubules are somewhat separated from the interglandular tissue as the result of shrinkage.

PEOCESSES OF NERVE-CELLS 223 of the two processes becomes gradually shifted as development proceeds (fig. 334), so that they presently are found to arise from the same point of the cell, and eventually the common attachment becomes lengthened out into a single axon. This bifurcates a certain distance from the cell-body, which has thus become unipolar. The bipolar condition is retained in the cells of the ganglion of the cochlea and the ganglion of Scarpa on the eighth nerve. It is also permanent Fig. 346.—Spin.\l ganglion-cells and fibres op ray Osmic preparation.

The medullary sheaths of the nerve-fibres are stained black by the osmic acid. in the spinal ganglia of certain fishes (fig. 346). Occasionally a thin layer of myelin extends from the medullary sheath of the nerve-fibre over the cell-body of a bipolar cell (fig. 347). Cells with processes extending from opposite poles of the cell-body occur in other situations than those above enumerated, as in the ganglion-cells and inner granules of the retina of the eye ; but in these instances the two processes are Fig. 347.—A bipolar cell from spinal ganglion of fish, showing the medullary SHEATH OP the NERVE-FIBRES CONTINUED AS A THIN LAYER OVER THE CELL-BODY. (E. Holmgren.) different in character, the one being an axon and the other a dendron. In some of the sense-organs, as in the olfactory cells of the olfactory mucous membrane (fig. 348) and in the rod and cone cells of the retina (fig. 461), which are also bipolar, the central process is an axon, and the peripheral process is an unbranched pro- jection from the cell-body specially modified to receive the physical or chemical stimulus which is converted by the cell into a nervous impulse. It is true that

CELL-DIVISION 49 centres are negatively charged portions of protoplasm—a condition which would be brought about if reduction processes were active at those centres. The result of this would be that the plane of the equator of the spindle joining the astral centres would become positive, and would tend to attract any negatively charged bodies floating freely in the protoplasm. This is certainly the condition of the chromosomes, which are pronouncedly acid and are to be looked Fig. 83.—The pbincipal phases of the nuclear chromatin filaments in the process OF ORDINARY MITOSIS OF THE SOMATIC CELL. (Flemming.) A, skein or spirem; B, aster with splitting of chromosomes; C, separation of the split chromosomes (metakinesis); D, continuation of this process; JE, diaster; dispirem. The cell-protoplasm is represented in outline in JE : it has itself undergone division at this stage. In this figure the (somatic) cells represented are supposed to have eight chromosomes.

The CIRCUMJACENT FLUID IS OF INTERMEDIATE DENSITY. (VetWOm, after Leduc.) upon as aggregates of anions ; in this manner the changes in position which they assume in karyokinesis might be explained. Such changes of position can be imitated with Mayer’s floating magnets, composed of magnetised needles passed through small pieces of cork and allowed to float on water with similar poles uppermost. If such magnets are conjoined by threads or wires into linear series and the repulsive poles of two fixed bar magnets are brought near the opposite VOL. II. PART I. E

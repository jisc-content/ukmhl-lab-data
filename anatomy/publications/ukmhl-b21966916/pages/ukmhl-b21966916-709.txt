OVARY 649 nucleolus {germinal spot, macula germinativa of Wagner). While still within the Graafian follicle, the nucleus may approach the surface of the ovum and exhibit mitotic division changes (formation of polar globules) (fig. 943), but this change occurs more commonly after discharge of the ovum and while it is within the Fallopian tube.

Immediately sm’rounding the zona radiata, as the ovum lies within the mature Graafian follicle, is a thin stratum of granular substance, probably deposited upon the exterior of the ovum by the innermost cells of the discus proligerus, which immediately encircle the ovum Fig. 945.—Ovary of human fcetus, showing the thickened gebminal epithelium, TOGETHEB WITH ELONGATED GBOUPS OF GEBMINAL EPITHELIUM-CELLS AND PBIMITIVE OVA WITHIN THE STROMA. (Felix and Biihler.) within the follicle (fig. 943) and often cling to it for a time after its discharge. When the Graafian follicle bursts and the ovum is set free, this granular material appears to imbibe water, and, as is specially noticeable in the ovum of the rabbit, swells up into a clear gelatinous envelope, which has been termed, from a possible homology with the white of

Since it is from these cells that the non-medullated fibres pass to the visceral and vascular systems, it is clear that the ganglia in question form an intermediate Fig. 373.—Ending of autonomic nerves (probably from vagus) in a small peripheral GANGLION OF THE HEART.

The cells of the sympathetic ganglia act, therefore, as distributing agents for the nerve-impulses which reach them from cells in the lateral horn of the spinal cord and from corresponding nerve-nuclei in the bulb. 1 For the evidence on this point, see Biedl, Wien. klin.

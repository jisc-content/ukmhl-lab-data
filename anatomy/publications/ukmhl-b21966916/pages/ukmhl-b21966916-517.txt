473 DEVELOPMENT that form the inner root-sheath, while the granules which are found in the cells from which the fibrous substance and cuticula of the hair are produced stain brown with picrocarmine and resemble the onychogenic substance of the nail- matrix. As the young hair reaches in its growth the upper part of the follicle, the central cells which block the neck of the follicle undergo a kind of fatty degeneration, and disintegrate to produce a sebaceous secretion like that of the sebaceous glands (fig. 686, t) a channel thus becomes formed between the epidermis-cells, which Fig. 687.â€”Longitudinal, section of a hair with its follicle from a six-months HUMAN EMBRYO.

The young hair continuing to grow, eventually appears through the cuticle ; it is often bent like a whip, and the doubled part protrudes. The sebaceous glands are in the meantime becoming formed as lateral buddings of the outer root-sheath into the corium (s); they soon open into the mouth of the follicle. Between the soft cells of the hair-bulb in the growing hair wander-cells con- taining pigment granules are frequently seen : it has been supposed that the pigment may be carried to the cells of the hair-bulb through their agency (Riehl).

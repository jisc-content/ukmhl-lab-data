INTERNALLY SECRETING GLANDS 688 brown staining with chromic acid and yield a substance having the physiological effects of adrenin.' The nodules are pervaded by a dense network of sinus-like blood-capillaries (fig. 990), and large lymphatic vessels surround the outside of the nodules. In mode of origin and to some extent in structure they resemble the parathyroids ; they are developed from the entoderm of the third branchial pouch.^ The coccyg-eal g*land (Luschka) lies just in front of the apex of the coccyx. It is about 2J mm. in diameter, but is sometimes broken up into smaller parts. Like the carotid glands, it is formed of masses of epithelial cells imbedded in a fibrous stroma (figs. 991, 992). The masses are irregular in shape and size, and are very vascular, the vessels having a sinusoidal character. The blood is derived from Fig. 993.â€”Dissectioks of two specimens of the lower end of the aorta and adjacent STRUCTURES IN THE HUMAN FOETUS, TO SHOW THE PARAGANGLIA USUALLY PRESENT IN THAT SITUATION (Zuckerkandl.) ao, aorta; vc, vena cava; ?*, r', left renal artery and vein respectively; u, ureter; ua, umbilical artery; sy, sympathetic plexus ; j)araganglia. the median sacral artery. The cells of the gland come into close relationship to the sinuses, with only a layer of endothelium between ; indeed, the presence of this layer is not always easy of detection. It is usually stated that some of the cells are chromaphil in character, but this is denied by Stoerck.'"^ Numerous nerves pass to the coccygeal gland, and Luschka described ganglion- cells within it, but this description has not been confirmed by modern investigations. The mode of development and the function of the coccygeal gland has not been ^ Muloii, Arch. g(hi. de m4d. Ixxxi. 1903. - H. Fox, Proc. Assoc. Amer. Anat., Amer. Journ.

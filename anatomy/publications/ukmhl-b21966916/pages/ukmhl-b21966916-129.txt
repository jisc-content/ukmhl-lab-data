107 CELLS OE ALEOLAR TISSUE number of them are in close contact they form an epithelium-like layer in the tissue or upon its surfaces (fig. 184). That these cells are of a similar nature to the endothelium-cells of a serous membrane is shown by the observation of Gronroos,‘ who found that if the endothelial cells are removed from the omentum of an adult cat no other cells are left either between or over the reticulating fibril-bundles. The endothelium-cells must, therefore, here be the only representatives of connective- tissue cells. When less closely arranged they tend to assume a branched irregular form, the branches themselves being often of a lamellar character. They may be connected by their branches into a network (syncytium), as is characteristically Fig, 175.—Fibres and cells of areolar tissue, from a film preparation ; guinea-pig. (Maximow.)

In some connective tissues they are the only cells present. Each cell has an oval nucleus and clear protoplasm, which may, however, contain a few granules. Occasionally a cell is seen with an appearance of fibrillation (fig. 171, /), but the fibrils have none of the characters of the white fibres of the tissue, although the appearance of the cells has been held to imply that these fibres are formed within the cells. The fibrillation is probably a form of cytomitome. 2. Clasmocytes (Ranvier).—These are elongated or irregular cells, with elliptical nuclei and granular or vacuolated protoplasm ; they are common in many parts of the areolar tissue. They may represent less differentiated mesenchyme cells than the lamellar cells. Some authors derive the clasmocytes from leucoc3rtes, terming them ‘ fixed Avander-cells." ‘ Anat. Hefte, xxii. 1903.

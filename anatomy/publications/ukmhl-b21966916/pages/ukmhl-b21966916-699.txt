COWPER’S GLANDS 639 lost their clear appearance. The ducts are lined with cubical epithelium. The ducts unite outside each gland to form a single excretory duct. These ducts run forward near each other for about 3 or 4 cm., first in the spongy substance and then beneath’the mucous membrane, and terminate in the floor of the bulbous Fig. 929.—Base of the male bladder, prostate, &c. (Symington.) Bl, part of base covered by peritoneum, separated by a dotted line from a triangular space left uncovered by that membrane; u, ureter; s. v., seminal vesicle; e. d., ejaculatory duct; p, prostate; M., membranous part of urethra; b, bulb; c.s., corpus spongiosum; c.G., Cowper’s gland. part of the urethra by two minute orifices opening obliquely. The glands secrete a viscid fluid, the use of which is not known. They appear to diminish in size in old age. Sometimes there is only one present, and it is said that both may be absent. According to Brans, the acini of these glands may sometimes anastomose to form a network. PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland (figs. 925, 929) is one of the accesspty tnale organs of generation. It atrophies in the adult after the testicles are excised, and when these organs are removed in infancy it remains undeveloped. In animals it enlarges, with the testicles, during the breeding season.

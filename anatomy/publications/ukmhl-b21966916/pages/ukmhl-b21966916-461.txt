419 DEVELOPMENT OF SEEOUS MEMBRANES into a somewhat finer plexus near the surface, where the nerve-fibres end in terminal ramifications and in end-bulbs. In the deeper parts of some serous membranes Pacinian corpuscles occur. These terminations have already been considered (pp. 263, 267, 275, and figs. 412, 413, 421, and 436). Development of the serous membranes.—^The serous cavities are all developed from the ccelomic split which occurs in the lateral mesodermic sheet at an early stage of embryonic history. The mesoderm-cells which line the cavity of the intra-embryonic coelom ‘ become the endothelium of the serous membrane and the adjoining mesoderm becomes developed into the connective tissue of the serous membrane. The connexion of the cavities of these membranes with lymph- vessels, which, as well as blood-vessels and nerves, penetrate freely into the serous membrane and ramify near its free surface, is established later by the formation of stomata. The serous cavities, therefore, although moistened with a fluid of the general nature of lymph, are not strictly speaking to be regarded as enlarged lymph-spaces like those which occur so extensively under the skin of the frog. ^ An account of the formation of the coelom and the subsequent changes which occur in it and result in its subdivision into the several serous cavities will be found in the part of this work (Vol. I.) which deals with Embryology.

80 VITAL PHENOMENA OF PROTOPLASM from A to K will be to diminish the contact difference of potential at points such as a, which form the physiological anode, and to increase it at points such as h, which form the physiological / ^ kathode. Therefore . . . the effect will be to increase the surface tension at points such as a, and to decrease it at points such as h. The surface and, consequently, the volume on the kathodic side of the organism will therefore increase, while on the anodic side they will decrease. The organism will therefore move over towards the kathode as indicated by the arrow. , . . Consider now the effect of a similar current upon a “ negative ” amoeboid organism (fig. 125) ; that is, one which is laden with anion-proteid. . . . In this case the contact difference of potential will be increased at the physiological anode and decreased at the physiological kathode; hence, reasoning as before, the organism will move towards the anode. . . . ‘ The effects upon ciliated organisms will be similar, for if the diagram (fig. 126) represents one of the cilia of a “ positive ” organism subjected to a constant current in the sense indicated, the difference of potential of the surface forming the physiological anode will be diminished and Fig. 123.- Cilia of Fbontonia leucas.

FUNCTIONS OF NUCLEUS 59 and has been shed out from it for the nutrition of the growing and differentiating protoplasm. In gland-cells generally the nuclei become enlarged and richer in chromatin in the earlier stages of secretory activity, and in the later stages become diminished in size and poorer in chromatin, in consequence, it is suggested, of a discharge of the chromatic material into the cytoplasm for the production of the Fig. 95.—Egg-cell op Pholcus phalangoides. (Gurwitsch, after Van Bambeke.) The germinal vesicle (nucleus) has amoeboid processes extending towards the portions of the ovum where food-granules are accumulating. special products of secretion.' In other cells also extrusions of material from the nucleus have been observed : in many cases these are undoubtedly derived from the nucleolus. Carlier suggests that this nucleolar extrusion is effete material, but it is generally considered to be matter elaborated within the nucleus and passed out into the cytoplasm for the formation of the metabolites of the cell (see p. 37).

In the least developed the nucleus con- tains abundance of basi-chromatin; the others show less within the nucleus, and an accumulation in the protoplasm near the nucleus.

In some gland-cells, e.g. those of the pancreas, a darkly staining spheroidal or crescentic body has been described by Ogata and others, situated in the cytoplasm, near the nucleus (fig. 97), and believed to be derived from the nucleus or nucleolus, although this is not definitely established. It has been termed 'paranucleus 1 Cf. Carlier, La Cellule, t. xvi. 1899, and Proc. Scottish Nat. Hist. Soc. v. 1909.

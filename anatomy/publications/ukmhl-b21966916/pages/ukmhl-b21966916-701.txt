641 PROSTATE connective-tissue wall, with fine elastic fibres, appearing like a basement-membrane. In the upper part of the gland the acini are smaller and more saccular ; in the middle and lower parts the tubes are longer and convoluted at their ends. The capillary blood-vessels form a close network over the ducts and acini, as in most other glands. The different portions of the gland are united by areolar tissue, and supported by processes of the deep layer of the fibrous capsule and by the muscular stroma. The ducts open upon the floor of the urethra, chiefly in the hollow on each side of the colliculus seminalis. The acini are often found distended so as to form cyst-like enlargements. They frequently contain concrements of laminated appearance resembling starch-grains, and known as ‘ amyloid" bodies (fig. 930, h) ; these are formed of a colloid substance giving protein reactions. Blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.—The arteries are derived from the vesical, haemorrhoidal, and pudic. The veins form a plexus imbedded in the fibrous covering round the sides and front of the gland ; this plexus is highly developed in old subjects. The veins communicate in front with the dorsal vein of the penis, and behind with branches of the internal iliac vein. Lymphatics are numerous. They commence in the glandular part and, accompanying the veins, pass to a plexus at the periphery of the organ, between the two layers of the fibrous capsule. They go to lymph-glands in the pelvis. The nerves, which are derived from the hypogastric plexus, consist of both medullated and non- medullated fibres, and are interspersed with ganglion-cells. They end in the muscular tissue of the gland and of its blood-vessels; some have been traced to the gland-epithelium. End-bulbs and Pacinian bodies have also been observed on the superficial nerves. Examined after death, the prostatic fluid has a milky aspect, due to the admixture of a large number of epithehal cells; probably, during life, it is more transparent. It is not a mucous secretion, but according to Adams the fluid has an acid reaction, and exhibits under the microscope numerous granules, epithehal cells and nuclei. Some of the granules are com- posed of lecithin (Eurbringer, Jena Sitzungsb., 1881). The following articles on the male organs of generation may here be mentioned : Aiehel, Arch. f. mikr. Anat.

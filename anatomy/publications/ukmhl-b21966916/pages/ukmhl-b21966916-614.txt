PANCREAS 560 cell, but becomes conspicuous, in stained preparations, during activity. Its development from extruded nuclear matter and the formation from it of the zymogen-granules have been described by some authors, but have been denied by others. In any case the secretion- granules, in the pancreas as in other glands, are probably formed from the particles known as chondrosomes or mitochondria * (see p. 24), which are present in the protoplasm of most cells, and are thought to be the chief agents in the formation of all structures connected with the active functions of cells. An enlargement of the nucleus of the pancre- atic cell during activity and its transference towards the base of the cell was observed during life by Kiihne and Lea. 0” Various observers, after forcing injections from the duct backwards into the alveoli of the pancreas, have seen fine intercellular canaheuli, comparable to those of the liver, passing from the lumen of an alveolus between the secreting cells. These can be shown much more easily, however, by the Fig. 815.—Alveoli of dog’s pancbeas after a PERIOD OF ACTIVITY PRODUCED BY VAGUS STIMU- LATION. (Babkin, Rubasekin and Ssawitsch.) Fig. 81G.

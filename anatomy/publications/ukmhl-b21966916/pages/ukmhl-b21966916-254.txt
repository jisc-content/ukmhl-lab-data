NERVE-CELLS 222 in tlie ganglion or from a cell of a sympathetic ganglion. Its function is unknown.’ Some of the cells of the spinal ganglia have other processes besides the axon, but their nature is uncertain. They rarely extend beyond the capsule which encloses the ganglion-cell, and they have not the character of dendrons. Fig. 844.—Pebicellular arborisations in spinal ganglion-cells. (Cajal.) In A the arborisation extends over the cell-body; in B it is limited to the axon, g, h, c, d, afferent fibres. but rather resemble developing axons (fig. 345), being fine fibres which end in a marked enlargement. They were first noticed by Huber ^ in the frog, and have since been described in many situations by Cajal.^ Nageotti ^ has suggested, Fig. 345.—Cerebro-spinal ganglion-cells (man). (Cajal.) a, &, intracapsular dendrons, with knobbed extremities. with much probability, that the processes in question are aborted axons or their collaterals. They occur also in sympathetic ganglia (fig. 351). In the early embryo the cells of the spinal ganglia are bipolar, a nerve-fibre process proceeding from each end of the elongated cell-body.

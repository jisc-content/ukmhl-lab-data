208 NERVE-CELLS may be observed to pass entirely through the cell-body from one process into another.’ In this respect they resemble the neuro-fibrils of nerve-cells and the fibrils which can be seen in certain varieties of epithelium. Although usually of a stellate shape owing to the fact that their processes extend more or less from all parts of the cell-body, in certain parts the neuroglia-cells take on an elongated shape (fig. 315), as is seen in the superficial layer of both the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.^ The long fibre-like nucleated cells of the retina which are known as the fibres of Muller are also to be looked upon as of a neuroglial nature. According to the observations of Hardesty ^ in the j)ig-embryo, the neuroglia-fibres become developed within a syncytium of neural ectoderm- cells which is known as the neuro-spongium (His). They appear relatively late, long after connective- tissue fibres have made their appearance and after medullation of the nerve-fibres has commenced. a a Fig. 319.—Nerve-cell from ventral horn of SPINAL CORD.

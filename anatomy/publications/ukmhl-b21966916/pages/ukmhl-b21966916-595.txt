ABSOEPTION FROM INTESTINE 545 the epithelium.’ In some animals absorption may take place so rapidly that the absorbed fat, after being finely divided and modified in the epithelium-cells, may be set free between them Fig. 793.—Section of p.akt of a rat’s villus during absorption of fat.

Eventually, however, most of it appears to be removed by these cells. The agency of the epithelium-cells in fat-absorption has been Fig. 794.—Section of frog’s intes- tine DURING ABSORPTION OF FAT.

The fatty particles in the epithelium-cells are coarse in the peripheral and fine in the central zone of each cell.

Secreting* g*lands of small intestine.—Two kinds of small secreting glands open on the inner surface of the intestine, viz. the crypts of Lieberkuhn and the glands of Brunner, the last being peculiar to the duodenum. 1 R. Zipkin (Anat. Hefte, xxiii. 1903) also describes the numerous leucocytes in the villi of the monkey (Innuus rhesus) as being phagocytic. VOL. II. PART I. N N

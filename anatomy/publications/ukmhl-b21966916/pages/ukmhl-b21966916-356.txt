STRUCTURE OF NERVE-CENTRES 320 venous sinuses in the dura mater the arachnoid exhibits numerous villus-like outgrowths (arachnoid villi, Pacchionian granulations) (fig. 495) which project into the subdural space and even grow, covered with a thin layer of invaginated dura mater, into the venous sinuses of that membrane. These villi, although closed, appear readily to permit the filtration of cerebro- spinal fluid from the subarachnoid space into the subdural space and even into the venous sinuses. There are no lymphatic vessels in the central nervous system, and the only other path of exit for the cerebro-spinal fluid is along the sheaths of the nerve-roots and nerve-trunks, which are lamellated, with crevices between the layers, and are continuous with the membranes of the brain and cord. The encephalic 'pia mater, which dips into all the sulci between the convolutions of the cerebrum and between the laminae of the cerebellum, gives off its blood-vessels directly into the cortical grey matter. It is invaginated at the side of the brain into the lateral ventricles— but does not project naked into them, for it is covered with ependymal epithelium—and similarly over the third ventricle, forming the velum interpositum or tela choroidea and the choroid plexuses of those ventricles. It is also prolonged over the fourth ventricle, forming its choroid plexuses (p. 300). These plexuses, which are in all probability concerned with the secretion of cerebro-spinal fluid, are composed of close capillary networks, which are covered everywhere on the side of the ventricle with a prolongation of its ependymal epithelium, which is here of a flattened character and non-ciliated.

120 THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES the cells in the intercellular substance being excluded. It is, however, not difficult to show that a formation of fibres may occur in the animal organism without a direct transformation of protoplasm, although the materials for such formation may be m ect i Fig. 196.—From a section of a forty-eight-hour chick embryo.

Thus in coelenterates, in which a low form of connective tissue first makes its appearance, this is distinguished at first by a total absence of cellular elements, a ground-substance only being developed and fibres becoming formed in it. Again, the fibres of the shell-membrane of the bird's egg are certainly not formed Fig. 197.—Developing connective tissue in heart of embryo chick of forty-eight HOURS.

And in many parts where ordi- nary connective tissue will subsequently be developed its place may at first be

Fig. 479.—Diagram of arrangement of nerve-cells and fibres in cerebellar cortex. (Kolliker.) P, cell of Purkinje; p, its axon, giving off collaterals near cell-body; G, cell of Golgi; &, basket-cell; 7?i, small cells of molecular layer; gr, cells of granule-layer; m.f., afferent fibres (moss-fibres) ending in granule-layer ; cl.f., a climbing afferent fibre ending in a synapse around the dendrons of a Purkinje cell; gl^, gV^, gP, three types of neuroglia-cells. substantia nigra ; within the tegmentum is the round bundle of the superior cere- bellar peduncle in the lower part of the mid-brain and the red nucleus in the higher part; at the side of the tegmentum is the lateral fillet. Characteristic of this part of the brain are four prominent tubercles, two on each side, overlying the dorsal part of the central grey matter ; these are the anterior and posterior quadrigeminal bodies [anterior and posterior tubercles). The nuclei from which the fibres of the third and fourth nerves originate lie in the central grey matter ventral to the aqueduct, on each side of the middle line. The fibres of the fourth nerve have 3Qg STKUCTURF OF NERVE-CENTRES peduncles which characterise and give its name to the pons have disappeared. The pyramid-bundles of the pons are collected in the ventral part of the mid-brain on mther side of the middle line to form the crusta or pes pedunculi; the fourth ventricle ; is narrowed into the small aqueduct, which is surrounded by a continuation of central grey matter ; below it is a continuation of the reticular formation of the pons, here ; known as the tegmentum ; ventral to this is the main fillet, which is separated from the crusta by grey matter containing darkly pigmented nerve-cells—the

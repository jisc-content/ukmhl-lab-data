HAIR-FOLLICLE 4G7 latter is pulled out; lienee it has been named the ‘ root-slieatli.’ It consists of an outer, softer, and, in the fresh condition, more opaque stratum next to the dermic coat of the follicle, and an internal more transparent layer, next to the hair. The former, named also the outer root-sheath, and in most parts of the follicle much the thicker of the two, corresponds with the rete mucosum of the epidermis in general. It is formed of protoplasmic cells, of polygonal form, but flattened tangentially in places ; they include pigment-granules in the coloured races. They are distinctly i- ii. iii. iv.

At the deeper part these cells form a much thinner stratum and pass continuously into those of the hair-knob. The internal layer, or inner root-sheath, which represents part of the stratum corneum of the epidermis, is not continuous with that, for it ceases abruptly a little below the orifices of the sebaceous ducts. Lining the root-sheath internally is a layer of im- bricated, downwardly projecting scales, the cuticle of the root-sheath (figs. 678,679, c); it is applied to the cuticle of the hair proper, to whose upwardly directed scales it fits like a mould. Its scaly cells, as well as those of the hair-cuticle, pass, at the bottom of the follicle, into a layer of columnar cells which covers the surface of the hh2

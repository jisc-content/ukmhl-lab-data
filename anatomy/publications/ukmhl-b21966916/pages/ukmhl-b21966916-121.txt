101 S PE CIA T. AlO 1 )I FI C ATI 0 N S At the line of cessation of the retina—known as the ora serrala—this membrane is ))i’olonged over the ciliary processes as the pars ciliaris refince. This is not, however, true retina, for it has none of the nervous elements and is com])osed of but two layers, an inner layer of clear elongated columnar epithelium-cells and an outer layer of cubical ]hgmented epithelium : the latter being A n Fig. 166.—Pigmented epithelium of the retina.

These pigmented cells are continued over the back of the iris, and are here reinforced • Fig. 167.—Section of posterior layers of iris, human, near its attachment to the CHOROID. (Schiifer.) Magnified 600 diameters. s, iris-stroma of connective tissue, showing three pigmented connective-tissue cells; d, plain muscle-cells of dilatator pupillie; P-, pigmented epithelium-cells continued from retinal layers. Most of the cells of the stratum, 7;-, are broken away. by a second pigmented layer which lies internal (posterior) to them (tig. 167). The cells of both of these layers as well as the pigment-cells of the pars ciliaris retinse are filled with dark pigment- granules, the purpose of ivhich is to block the passage of light-rays, so that the path of these may be confined to the pupil.

SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES 422 closely arranged. As Hammar has shown, some parts of the membrane are much richer in cells than others. Many of the smaller synovial villi (see below) contain very few cells, or even none at all (fig. 622). The cells of a vaginal synovial membrane are often slightly elongated in the direction of the axis of the tendon.

The articular synovial membranes pass, as before said, a certain distance over the cartilages of the joints. They do not, however, end abruptly, but shade off gradually into the margin of the cartilage, the fibrous tissue becoming fibro-cartilage and the cells gradually losing their processes and becoming transformed into cartilage-cells Fig. 626.—Transition of cartilage-cells into connective-tissue corpuscles of SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE.

(fig. 626), SO that it is difficult to say where the one structure begins and the other ends. This portion of the synovial membrane,, or of the cartilage, is known as the ‘ marginal zone ’ ; it is best marked around the convex heads of the bones, and is especially well seen near the lower margin of the patella (Hiiter). The Haversian folds, at least the larger ones, agree in general structure with the rest of the tissue of the synovial membrane, being vascular folds of that membrane, the largest of them usually containing fat; their surface layer consists for the most

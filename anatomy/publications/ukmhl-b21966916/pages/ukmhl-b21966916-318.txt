The peripheral process is a part of the cell-body modified to receive the particular form of sensory impression which the sense- organ is adapted to convert into a nervous impulse. To this type the olfactory and visual sense-organs conform. Lwnhricvs Nereis Vertehrata Fig. 447.—Diageams showing the position of the sensoey neeve-cell in Lumbeicus, Neeeis, and Veetebeata. (G. Retzius.) Fig. 448.—Diageams showing the modes of ending of sensoey neeves in the eae, TASTE-BUDS, AND EPIDEEMIS EESPECTIVELY. (G. RetziuS.) That the latter type is the more primitive is shown by the fact that it is met with in the lowest examples of Metazoa in which definite sensory nerves can be shown to exist. This is exemplified in the sensory organs (‘ eye-spots ’) of medusge,

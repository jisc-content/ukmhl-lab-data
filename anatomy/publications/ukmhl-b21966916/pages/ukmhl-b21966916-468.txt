426 SECKETING GLANDS construction of secreting glands. If the recess is simple its blind termination, which is often enlarged, is spoken of as the ‘ fundus' of the gland. If compound, its termina- tions are known as ‘alveoli’ or ‘ acini, may be tubular or saccular: of these two kinds of simple gland the former is by far the more common. Examples of simple saccular glands are found in the skin of the frog (fig. 628), of simple tubular glands in the alimentary canal (fig. 629). The secreting surface may be increased, in a simple tubular gland, by mere lengthening of the tube, in which case, however, when it acquires considerable length, the tube is coiled up into a ball so as to take up less In a simple gland the shape of the cavity Fig. 628.—Simple sacculab gland fkom THE AMPHIBIAN SKIN.

The sweat- glands of the skin are instances of simple glands formed of a long convoluted tube. But the chief means of further increasing the secreting surface is by sub- division, as well as extension, of the cavity, and when this occurs the gland is Fig. 630.—Diagbam of small ACINOUS GLAND FOBMED OF A SIMPLE DUCT-SYSTEM.

There is, however, a condition sometimes met with, in which the sides or extremity of a simple tube or sac merely become pouched or loculated, in which case the tube is termed the gland-duct, as in the Meibomian glands of the eyelids ; in some cases, as in the small mucous glands generally, the pouchings

DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE-TISSUE FIBRES 121 taken, even in vertebrata, by a jelly-like tissue pervaded by a network or feltwork of fibres, amongst which mesenchyme cells only penetrate at a later stage. A jelly- Fig. 198.—From a section of a nineteen-day trout embryo.

The jelly-like connective tissue of the embryo persists in the umbilical cord until birth as the so-called jelly of Wharton (fig. 199), but the fibres in it are by this time numerous. Elsewhere it has largely lost its jelly- like character in conse- quence of the considerable development of fibres in the ground-substance, but the amount to which they are developed varies greatly. In the vitreous humour of the eye, which has generally been described as developing from mesoderm which has grown in between the ecto- derm of the lens and that of the retina, but few fibres are developed, and such cells as there are become for the most part either atrophied or much modified, and remain relatively few //■' H If '» \ F w , ■■ ■ ' : ^\'rt -'i 9 A .A '■ |V ■ U. -I H k f % if '*c \ ' V Fig. 199.—Jelly of Wharton from umbilical cord of new-born child.

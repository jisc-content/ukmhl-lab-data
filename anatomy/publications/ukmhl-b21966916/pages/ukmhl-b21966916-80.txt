60 FUNCTIONS OF NUCLEUS (Nebenkern). A similar body was described by Balbiani in the ova of arachnids, under the name of ‘ yolk-nucleiis,’ and the presence of a yolk-nucleus has also been described in the ovarian ovum of the fowl,^ and has since been noticed in ' other oocytes. Rabl finds a paranucleus in the salamander larva in the tissue- cells generally.^ Connected with the paranucleus, and perhaps derived from it, are frequently to be seen filaments {chondromitome, see p. 24) which stain similarly with basic dyes and which are directed towards the part of the cell where the granules of zymogen are becoming formed. It has been suggested that the para- nucleus and the fibrils in question are concerned in the elaboration of the secretion material, and the protoplasm which forms them has been accordingly termed the ergastoflasm (Gamier).

As a further proof of the activity of the nucleus in connexion with the metabolic functions of the cell may be mentioned the fact that in the liver-cells crystals of haemoglobin, derived, no doubt, from the breaking down of red blood-corpuscles, are occasionally to be seen not only in the cell-protoplasm but even in the interior of the nucleus, which may be distorted in shape by the presence of such a crystal.^ Further, it has been shown by E. Holmgren^ that in the nerve-cell the substance of the Nissl granules begins to form near the nucleus, often at one side of this, between it and the centrosome. At this place the nuclear membrane may become absorbed and nucleolar substance may be extruded (fig. 98). ^ Schafer, Proc. Boy. Soc. xxx. 1880. ^ Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xlv. 1895. 5 Browicz, Bull.

STKUCTURE OF CELL 32 cilium-like filament (centriole-filament) which is attached to certain secretory epithelium-cells (fig. 59).* Possibly the basal particles of ciliated cells (see p. 72) are produced by division and multiplication of the centrioles (Lenhossek' Hen- neguy) (fig. 60). Centrosomes have also been thought to be concerned with the formation of cell-membranes. As has already been explained, the phenomena of radiation from certain points can be imitated by inducing localised coagulation in the gel condi- tion of colloidal solutions (p. 13). Moreover, structures (artificial astropheres) closely resem- bling centrosomes, and like these having the property of initiating cell-division, can be made to appear in the ova of Echinoids by adding certain excitatory agents ^ to the sea-water in TP ^ rn A which the ova are suspended (fig. 61).

Each non-ciliated cell has a diplosome at its free border ; these are not seen in the ciliated cells, but in the latter the free border is occupied by a row of double particles with which the cilia are connected.

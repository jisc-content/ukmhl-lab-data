NERVE-ENDINGS 290 and development abundantly shows, an extension, towards the periphery, of the lateral wall of the primitive brain (fore-brain). It is itself composed mainly of nervous matter, and most of its cells are unmistakable nerve-cells. The retinal elements are arranged in four series, viz.: (1) a layer of pigmented epithelium-cells. The protoplasm of these on the inner side, i.e. the side next to the following series (rods and cones), is loaded with pigment-granules (fig. 460, a). (2) A layer of palisade-like neurones which are termed, from the appearance of their peripheral obiter or choroidal surface. Fig. 460.—Diagram of a section through the RETINA. (M.

(3) A layer of small bipolar neurones termed the inner granules (inner nuclear layer, e). (4) A layer of comparatively large neurones, the axons of which become the axis-cylinder processes of the optic nerves (layer of ganglion- cells, g, plus nerve-fibre layer, h). Between the bipolar and the ganglion-cells layers and also between the bipolar and the rod- and cone-cell layers are the so-called 7nolecular layers {d, /), outer and inner. These are mainly composed of interlacing arborescent nerve-fibres, which in these layers form synapses between

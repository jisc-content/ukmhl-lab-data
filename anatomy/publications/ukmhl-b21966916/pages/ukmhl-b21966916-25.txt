GENERAL STRUCTURE OF TISSUES 5 G-eneral structure of the tissues.—All the tissues are, as has just been explained, originally derived from embryonic cells, and, in all, these cells become modified to form permanent con- stituents of the tissue. In some tissues other constituents are formed in the intercellular sub- stance, the relation of which to the cells has been already noticed. If the intercellular substance is in considerable amount (fig. 5) it is termed ground-substance', as in ordinary connective tissue, in car- tilage, in bone, and in dentine. When, on the other hand, it is met with only in very small amount (fig. 6), it has been termed cement - substance, since it serves merely to cement the cells to- gether. Intercellular substance varies in consistency in different tissues, being in some nearly or entirely fluid in character, whilst in others it has acquired consider- able rigidity, as in cartilage ; or it mav even become hard and <j calcified, as in bone and dentine.

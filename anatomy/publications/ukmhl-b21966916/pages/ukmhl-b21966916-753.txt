The rest of the parag'ang'lia of Kohn are scattered, as already stated, irregularly along the course of the abdominal aorta and between and near the kidneys (fig. 993). They vary a good deal in size and in situation. In structure they resemble the medulla of the suprarenal; some also have cells like those of the cortex of that organ. Many of their cells are chromapliil (fig. 994), and there is every reason to look upon them as accessory in function to the suprarenals. Aichel describe>s bodies of this nature as occurring occasionally in the following situa- tions: (1) in the kidney or underneath its capsule; (2) in the liver; (3) attached to the renal and solar plexuses ; (4) retroperitoneal, below kidney ; (5) in the broad ligament of the uterus ; (6) in the spermatic cord ; (7) between the testicle and epididymis ; (8) in the corpus Highmori. According to Kohn^ the largest of the paraganglia in man lie just above the division of the aorta (fig. 993), others just internal to and below the suprarenal capsules, others in the angle formed by the common ihacs, and yet others at the sides of the rectum. Smaller ones are scattered in the neighbourhood of the kidneys, ureters, aorta, and vena cava, and in the broad ligament. Swale Vincent describes a chromaphil body, noticed previously by Kohn, as constantly present at the back of the abdomen in the dog, cat, and rabbit, and occasionally in the rat. In the male of the last-named animal an accessory body having a structure like that of the suprarenal but without chromaphil-cells ^ is constantly found, attached to the head of the epididymis. THE PITUITARY BODY OB HYPOPHYSIS CEREBBI. The pituitary body is a small glandular organ about the size of a cob-nut, situated in the pituitary fossa of the sphenoid bone. It is connected by a funnel- shaped projection of the base of the brain (infundibulum) with the third cerebral ventricle, the cavity of which extends into the infundibulum; in some animals, but not in man, the cavity is prolonged into the interior of the gland (fig. 995). The pituitary body is surrounded and encapsuled by a prolongation of the dura mater. A sagittal section through the organ shows it to be composed of two distinct portions (fig. 995), which in most animals are almost separated from one another by a cleft (fig. 996, (/) containing a clear, colourless, glairy fluid. On examination with the microscope it is seen that the portion in front of the cleft (pars ^ Arch. f. mikr. Anat. liii. 1899. - Ihid. Ivi. 1900. ■' Oj). ('ll. 1903. ^ Proc. Roy. Soc. B.

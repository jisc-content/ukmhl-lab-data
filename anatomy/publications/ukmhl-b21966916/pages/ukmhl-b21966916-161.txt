FTBRO-CARTTLAGE la? resist tlie action of acetic acid ; they are in many parts short, fine, and confusedly intersecting each other in all directions ; in such parts the matrix has a rough indistinctly granular look, but sometimes this appear- ance is due to the fact that the elastic fibres are in- completely developed, the granules which are to form them having not yet run together into fibres. Some- times the fibres are longer and larger (fig. 222), but they still intercommuni- cate at short distances. In large animals such as the ox, where the fibres of ordinary elastic tissue attain a considerable size, those of elastic cartilage are also very large with comparatively wide meshes, occupied of course by the ground-substance and cartilage-cells.

Fig. 222.—Section of elastic cartilage (upper part of arytenoid of calf) stained WITH MAGENTA, Photograph. (Schafer.) Magnified 200 diameters. The elastin is seen partly in the form of a feltwork of fine fibrils, partly as distinct fine and coarse intercommunicating fibres. These are nowhere in contact with the cartilage-cells, which are surrounded by clear cartilage-matrix. At most parts of the section the cells have dropped out, but two or three are seen near the bottom of the figure, still m situ. Like hyaline cartilage, it possesses firmness and elasticity, but these properties are united with a much greater degree of flexibility and toughness.

The entering nerve, which is large, loses as a broad flat axis-cylinder, All of these, as well as the terminal expansions of the main fibre and its branches, show a network of neuro-fibrils (Van de Velde). End-bulbs, simple and complex, occur in many other situations. Thus they are found in the Fig. 411.—End-bulb of the human CONJUNCTIVA, TREATED WITH 3 PER CENT. ACETIC ACID AND 1 PER CENT. osMic ACID.

Large end-bulbs of a rounded oval form have been found in the synovial mem- brane of certain joints in man {e.g. those of the fingers), and also in the articular synovial membranes of several mammals.

ENDINGS OE BRONCHIAL TUBES 581 branches pass off at acute angles, but the more remote and smaller ramifications spring less acutely. After a certain stage of subdivision each bronchial tube, reduced to a small size (about 0’2 mm.), is termed a lobular or terminal bronchiole, and its walls become beset here and there with small hemispherical saccules, termed Fig. 847.—Portion of a transverse section of a bronchial tube, human (6 mm. in diameter). (P. E. Schultze.) Magnified 30 diameters. a, cartilage and fibrous layer with mucous glands, and, in the outer part, a little fat; in the middle, the duct of a gland opens on the inner surface of the tube; b, annular layer of involuntary muscular fibres; c, elastic layer, the elastic fibres in bundles which are seen cut across ; d, columnar ciliated epithelium. Within the lungs therair-tubes are not flattened on'one aspect like the bronchi and trachea, but form completely cylindrical tubes. Although they contain the same elements as the larger air-passages, they are reduced gradually to a state of greater tenuity, possessing throughout certain peculiarities ofletructure. Thus, the cartilages Fig. 846.—Cast of lobule of dog’s lung, showing a single infundibulum or air-sac. (W. S. Miller.) A, atrium; V, vestibule; 8, air-sac (infundibulum) ; P, section of the neck of a second air-sac (cut away). The irregular projections on the atrium and air-sac are the alveoli. air-cells, or alveoli. Each lobular bronchiole ends in a so-called vestibule, out of which open dilatations, which have been termed atria by W. S. Miller. Each atrium is continued into two or more blind and sacculated diverticula, the infundibula, or air-sacs (Miller) : their walls are completely covered with alveoli, which are also found on the walls of the vestibule and atrium (figs. 844 to 846).

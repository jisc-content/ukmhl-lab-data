346 BLOOD-VESSELS resembles a solid strand. This capillary contraction is by no means restricted to the cold-blooded animals, if we may judge by the fact that in the rabbit’s mesentery successful impregnation with gold chloride has revealed every capillary to be supplied with a nerve running along it, these nerves forming complete loops corresponding to the capillary meshwork. Contraction both of the whole capillary wall, as well as of the individual cells of capillary vessels, has been described by Strieker, Tarchanolf, Rouget, and Steinach.

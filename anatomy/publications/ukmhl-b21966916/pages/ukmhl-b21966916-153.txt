The cells are large, spheroidal and granular, and in many of them the fat is beginning to be formed, and assumes in the prepared section the appearance of clear droplets. Numerous blood-vessels containing blood-corpuscles are seen between the developing fat-cells. F. E. Hoggan"* stated that it may be deposited in wander-cells : this, however, is denied by Hammar. In some parts—especially in serous membranes such as the mesentery and omentum — adipose tissue is preceded by an accumulation of lymphocytes forming masses of lymphoid tissue which accompany the blood-vessels. Whether these become actually converted into fixed cells and the latter into fat-ceUs, or whether they gradually disappear and are replaced by fat-forming connective-tissue cells, has not been clearly determined, but this last is the conclusion arrived at by Klein. Similarly the thymus gland, an organ mainly formed of lymphocytes supported by ^ Arch. f. Anat. 1889. - Ibid. 1890. Flemming, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. vii. 1871; xii. 1876; Arch. f.

An actual transformation of the protein cell-granules into fat has been more particularly insisted on by Altmann ‘ and by E,. Metzner.- According to Flemming and Hammar, the deposition of fat does not take place in the basiphil ‘ mast-cells,’ but in ordinary cells of the connective tissue.'^ It probably occurs both in plasma-cells and in the lamellar cells.

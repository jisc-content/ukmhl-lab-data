327 ENDINCr OF NERVES IN HEART and the number of end-plates amounts to from about that the heart is supplied as abundantly with showing medullated nerves, 100 to 300 per sq. cm afferent nerves as is the most sensitive skin- surface. The endings of the efferent nerves were first observed by Gerlach ^ in the frog, by the use of the gold method. In the interauricular septum they form a complete plexus from which fine fibres go to individual columns of muscle-fibres, and there end after having divided several times on the surface of the columns. Smirnow,''^ working with the methylene-blue method, found the nerve-terminations in fishes, amphi- Fig. 506.—Endings of nebve-pibbes IN CABDiAC MUSCLE. (Smimow.)

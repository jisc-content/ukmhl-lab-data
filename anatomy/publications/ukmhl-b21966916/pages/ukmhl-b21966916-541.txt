497 DENTINE is twisted throughout its whole length in numerous fine spiral turns, which follow more closely one upon another ; these are the secondary curvatures (fig. 723). In form a tubule may accordingly be likened to the thread of a corkscrew, stretched so that the turns are drawn far apart and their breadth proportionally diminished (Welcker). The tubules are only slightly divergent as they pass towards the surface ; and, as Fig. 723.—Section of fang, parallel to THE DENTINE TUBULES (HUMAN CANINE). (Waldeyer.) Magnified 300 diameters. 1, cement, with large bone lacunae and indications of lamellae ; 2, granular layer of Purkinje (interglobular sjiaces); 3, dentinal tubules. Fig. 724.—Sections of dentine tubules. (Fraenckel.) a, cut across; cut obliquely. Magnified about 300 diameters. they occasionally divide dichotomously, at first without being much diminished in siise, they continue to occupy the substance of the dentine at almost equal distances. Their nearly parallel primary curvatures produce, by the manner in which they reflect the light, an appearance of concentric undulations in the dentine, which may be well seen with a low magni- fying power {Schreger’s lines). The average Fig. 725.—Vertical section of the upper PART OF AN INCISOR TOOTH. (Kdllikcr.) Magnified 7 diameters. a, the pulp-cavity ; h, dentine ; c, arched incremental lines; d, cement; e, enamel, with bands indicating the direction of the ranges of fibres ; /, coloured lines of the enamel. diameter of the tubules at their inner and larger end is 0*0055 mm. ; the distance between adjacent tubules is commonly about two or three times their width (fig. 723). From their sides, numerous exceedingly fine branches are given ofl, which j^ene- trate the hard intertubular substance, where they either anastomose or terminate blindly (fig. 723). These lateral ramuscles are more abundant in the fang. Near VOL. II. PART I. K K

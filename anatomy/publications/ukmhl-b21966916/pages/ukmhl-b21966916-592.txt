The examination of specimens taken during digestion of a meal containing fat shows this substance within the cells in the form at first of very fine particles mainly near the free end of the cell (fig. 792, A). The fine particles gradually enlarge and run together into droplets (fig.792,B), and these are passed towards the fixed end of the cell, there again becoming finer. Eventually the fine particles pass out of the epithelium-cells, and the leucocytes within the tissue of the villus may now contain them in Fiti. 785.—Tkansveese section of a villus of pig.

If, however, a transverse section be made of the peripheral end considerably later than this (sixty or seventy days after the original section), it is found that within the tubes formed by the old neurolemmal sheaths, according to Vanlair' and Cajal also between them, small single fibres or groups of fibres, either pale or provided with a Fig. 385. — Fibres from centr.al end of SCIATIC OF YOUNG RABBIT, CUT TEN DAYS BEFORE DEATH.

On cutting out the central end of the nerve, together with the cicatrix, and separating its fibres, it is seen that the groups of small fibres noticeable in a transverse section are continuous with the central ends of the axis- cylinders of the original nerve (fig. 383, D). Either a bunch of small fibres may grow directly from the axis-cylinder of one fibre, or one or two only emerge from this (figs. 384, 385); but these may bifurcate, and, repeating this process again and ' Arch, de Physiol. 1886.

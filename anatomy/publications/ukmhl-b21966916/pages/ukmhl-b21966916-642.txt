LUNGS 584 In the foetus the alveoli are entirely lined with small granular pavement-cells, but with the distension which follows upon the first respiratory efforts most of the cells become trans- formed into the large thin epithelial scales above described. The walls of the alveoli, which mainly consist of delicate fibrillated connective tissue (fig. 851), with corpuscles scattered here and there, are supported and Fig. 851.â€”Reticular tissue of pulmonary alveoli.

These fibres are especially numerous near the orifices of the alveoli, in addition to which, according to some authorities, there is likewise an intermixture of muscular fibre-cells. The alveoli vary greatly in appearance in sections of the lung, according to the state of distension of the organ, and although they are usually described as hemi- spherical, their shape is generally irregularly angular, with rounded angles.

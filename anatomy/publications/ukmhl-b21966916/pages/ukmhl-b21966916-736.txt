A tendency to formation of vesicles containing colloid is observable. thyroid are derived. When first developed they resemble embry- onic thymus rather than thyroid tissue (see Vol. I., p. 172, and fig. 216). Structure.—The parathy- roids are composed of small masses of epithelium-like cells, not very unlike the epithelium- cells of the thyroid, arranged in intercommunicating trabeculae with strands of highly vascular connective tissue between the trabeculae. According to Welsh ' the cells are of two kinds; but these may represent two func- tional conditions of the same kind of cell. Rulison^ also de- scribes two kinds of cells in the human parathyroid: the one kind clear, the other kind less numerous, somewhat larger and having oxyphil granules in their cytoplasm.^ According to Kuli- son the capillaries of the para- thyroids have the character of sinusoids. Sometimes, but rarely, the cells seem to be set around a spherical space, and thus to simulate thyroid vesicles, but normally the structural appear- ances are quite different from those of the thyroid; nor is there in the parathyroids a ten- dency to the accumulation of colloid. But Gley,"* and Vincent and Jolly'’ found in the cat that the parathyroid tissue may develop vesicles indistinguish- able from those of the thyroid if the whole of the thyroid have been removed, and only para- thyroids left (figs. 969 to 972). This result has been also ob- tained in the dog by Halpenny 1 0^9. cit. - Op. cit. ^ See also on secretion-granules in parathyroid-cells, D. Forsyth, Brit. Med. Journ. 1907; Engel, Intern.

275 AFFERENT NERVE-ENDINGS Nerve-endings of the above description are found in many parts of the body e.g. the skin and mucous membranes, the cornea of the eye and serous membranes, and in intermuscular connective tissue. In the skin and mucous membranes the nerve- fibrils penetrate between the elements of the covering epithelium (fig. 432). In the cornea they may even reach the surface, but in the epidermis they are not Fig. 434.—Ending of afferent nerve-fibres in the endoc.vrdium. (Dogiel.) found beyond the limits of the Malpighian layer. The nerves destined for the epidermis and those for the end-bulbs of the skin are generally different, but occasionally a nerve-fibre passes through an end-bulb and then on to the epidermis. In serous membranes and in the endocardium, as well as in intermuscular septa, the terminal fibrils end in flattened expansions (figs. 433 to 436) which somewhat recall the appearances seen in the organs of Golgi (see pp. 278, 279).

In the skin and mucous membranes the nerve-endings may exhibit a series of flattened leaf-like enlargements, presenting an appearance which has been compared by Eanvier to branches of ivy, and termed by him hederiform nerve- endings. Such occur in the most superficial layer of the derma in man, especially

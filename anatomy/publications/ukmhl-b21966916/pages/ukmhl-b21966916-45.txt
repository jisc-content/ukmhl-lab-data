25 CANALICULI IN PKOTOPLASM Canaliculi in cell-protoplasm.—Many cells show a network of fine anastomosing canaliculi within their protoplasm (figs. 40 to 42). These were first described in certain nerve-cells,' later in gland-cells,^ in columnar epithelium-cells,^ Fig. 40.—Deep netwokk op canaei- CULI WITHIN PKOTOPLASM OF SPINAL GANGLION-CELL. (Golgi.)

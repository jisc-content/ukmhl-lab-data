INTERNALLY SECRETINCI GLANDS 684 This hypertrophied part is very vascular and is further distinguished from the ordinary cortex by the absence of lipoids within its cells. It undergoes a fatty change immediately after birth, and by the end of the first year has entirely disappeared. The cortex of the adult gland is formed of cells which at first appear only as a thin marginal layer : these contain lipoids. They undergo development pan" passu with the atrophy of the foetal cortex. In the anencephalous foetus the ‘ foetal cortex ’ fails to develoj), and the suprarenal resembles that of other foetal animals. ‘ The medulla of the suprarenals is formed of a network or spongework of cell-columns, which bound anastomosing venous sinuses (sinusoids),^ both trabeculae and sinuses being larger than those of the zona reticularis of the cortex with which Fig. 987.—Section showing zona eeticulahis of cobtex, r, and medulla, m, of SUPKABENAL OF DOG.

The cells of the medulla are in close relationship to the endothelium lining the blood-sinuses, and in many parts form the only separation between the epithelium-cells and the blood. Some authors have, indeed, described the endothelium as being absent in parts, so that here the epithelium-cells would be directly bathed by the blood-plasma.^ Irregular lacuna-like diverticula from the sinusoids have also been described as penetrating into the cell-columns ^: it is thought that these may be for the pur- pose of facilitating the passage of the secretion of the cells into the blood ^ See also on the ‘ foetal cortex,’ E.

NE11VE-J)EGENE]IATI0N 252 centre, and his application of this discovery to the tracing the course of nerve-fibres in peripheral parts (now known as the AVallerian method) first gave full interest and importance to the observation of Nasse. Stated briefly, the law may be formulated as follows : ‘ Degeneration occurs along the whole extent of any nerve-fibre which is cut off frem the cell-body which governs its nutrition ’ ; and this, as the observations of His have shown, is in every case the body of the cell from which the nerve-fibre has originally grown.' ' The nerves to blood-vessels offer an apparent exception to this rule. They were found by Langley in the frog (Journ. Physiol, xxxviii. 1909) not to degenerate after section, their nutrition being probably maintained, as suggested by Bethe, by peripheral cells (see p. 227). Langley found that the nerves to the skeletal muscles of the frog took forty days to undergo degeneration. The post-ganglionic fibres of the sympathetic showed degeneration soonest

216 NEKVE-CELLS rarely, synapses may occur between dendrons (fig. 328). To such modes of contact between different nerve-cells (or in the usual parlance between different ‘ neurones') the term ‘ synapse" (M. Foster) has been applied. Synapses may be either ‘ investing ' or ‘ interlacing ' as in the instances above given, or the contact may be effected by the simple application of the branched or unbranched (and usually in that case dilated) extremity of an axon to the body of another nerve- cell. The calices described by Held in the trapezoid nucleus, and the somewhat similar enlargements of axons described by Cajal in the ventral acoustic nucleus (fig. 332) may be given as examples of this.^ The doctrine of contiguity without continuity of the anatomical units which compose the nervous system is not universally admitted, some observers holding that there is sufficient evidence to justify belief that the nerve-cells of a nerve-chain are continuous with one another —at least, so far as regards the neuro-fibrils,- Fig. 383.—Neueo-fibeils in neeve-cells feom anteeioe coepoe.\ quadeigemina of KITTEN.

Neuro-fibrils. — A distinctive character of nerve-cells is the existence of fibrils which pass into and through the cell-body and extend into all the processes. These neuro-fibrils (figs. 333 to 336) were first described by Max Schultze : they ^ Cf. Semi Meyer, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xlvii. 189G, and liv. 1899; Vincenzi, Anat. Anz. xviii. 1900. ^ Cf.

PELVIS OF KIDNEY cm ' Disse, 02). cit. 1902. of columnar cells (fig. 879). Througliout the greater part of the pelvis there are both longitudinal and circular ridges or projections of the vascular corium into the epithelium, which is thinner opposite the ridges and thicker between them. In tangential sections the ridges produce an appearance of reticulations. Besides these strongly marked ridges of the corium, finestrandsof connective tissue extend between the epithelium-cells almost to the surface. The ridges are highly vascular, -and within them and the strands of connective tissue just mentioned capillary Fig. 879. Longitudinal section through a papilla of the kidney showing its PROJECTION INTO ONE OF THE CALICES OF THE PELVIS. (Disse.) Bellini are seen cut obliquely ; the smaller tubules are looped tubules of Henle. a, epithelium covering papilla; b, epithelium lining calix; c, cavity of calix; d, connective tissue. j j > j vessels project into the deeper layers of the epithelium, with the cells of which They appear to come in contact (fig. 880).^ The pelvis contains no true glands, although at places solid buds of epithelium may grow down for a certain distance into the corium. Near its exit from the sinus of the kidney the pelvis becomes contracted, and opposite the lower end of the gland it assumes a cylindrical form and becomes continuous with the ureter.

Fig. 187.—Cross-section of the ligamentum NUCH.E OF THE OX. The fibres are of various size; their angles are for the most part rounded. They are collected into small bundles, which are separated by areolar tissue. This tissue also penetrates into the bundles. In elastic tissue there is a great proportionate development of the elastic fibres, the white bundles being relatively few and indistinct; but considerable variation is met with in the proportion of the two kinds of elements. The white bundles are, for the most part, disposed irregularly and course in difierent directions, as in areolar tissue ; but, in some elastic ligaments, there are bundles of white fibres, which run as in an ordinary ligament parallel with one another, and from end to end of the structure. The elastic fibres in an elastic ligament, as is well seen in sections across their course, are collected into smaller and larger groups or bundles (fig. 187), which are separated from one another by septa of the white tissue, but the latter also penetrates between the individual elastic fibres of the group. In some situations, as in the coats of the arteries, the elastic tissue takes the form either of a close network of fibres arranged in one plane so as to form an

GG6 VAGINA vagina with numerous branches, and form at each side a plexus named the vaginal plexus. There is a close network of lympJtatics in the mucous membrane, which also contains a considerable amount of lymphoid tissue, often collected into lymphoid nodules.' The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic, and from the fourth sacral and pudic nerves of the spinal system ; they are traceable to the erectile tissue, to the muscular fibres, and to the epithelium. The hymen is formed by a fold of mucous membrane; it has the same structure as the mucous membrane of the vagina. Fig. 960.—Tiiansverse section of vagina op monkey, lower part. (F. H. A. Marshall.) o, stratified epithelium; h, mucous membrane ; c, muscular coat, the fibres cut across ; d, a nerve-ganglion; iZ', nerves ; e, an artery ; /, fat-cells. On either side of the entrance of the vagina between the hymen and the labia minora are the orifices of the ducts of Bartholin’s grla^nds, which correspond to Cowper’s glands in the male. The glands themselves lie on each side of the vagina near its commencement. The}' are reddish yellow, round or oval bodies, about half an inch long. They have the structure of tubulo-racemose mucous glands, the alveoli being lined by very long mucus-secreting eells with their nuclei near the basement-membrane of the alveolus. The duct of each gland is itself ^ W. Krause, Haiidbucli der mensclil. Anat. 1879.

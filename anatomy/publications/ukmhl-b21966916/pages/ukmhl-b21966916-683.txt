625 KEINKE’S CRYSTALS enclose granules or globules of a fatty or lipoid nature, sometimes of a yellow colour; tliey are blackened by osmic acid. There may also be crystals Fig. 910.—Elastic fibres of intebtubular connective tissue of testicle, seen ENCIRCLING THE TUBULES. (E. C. Hill.) (fig. 911) of an indeterminate nature, varying in size and number, but generally of an elongated prismatic shape. a h Fig. 911.—Two interstitial cells of the human testicle, containing Reinke’s CBVSTALS. (Eberth.j Magnified 1000 diameters. In a the crystals are smaller and more numerous than in h. A double centrosome is seen in a. These crystals were first described by Reinke. The interstitial cells are not the only cells in the testicle where crystalline bodies are met with, for crystals which appear to be similar in character are found in some of the spermatogcnic cells of the seminiferous tubules (Lubarsch) and other much smaller bacillus-like crystals occur in the cells of Sertoli (Spangaro).

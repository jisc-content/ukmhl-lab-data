EPITHELIUxM OF TUBULES 599 found in both sets of convoluted tubules (figs. 870, 871),^ in the ascending or larger limb of the looped tubule, in the zigzag tubule and in the first part of the junctional tubule. The granules are derived from mitochondria ^ and appear Fig. 873.—Passage op the spieal continuation op a distal convoluted tubule into the DESCENDING LIMB OP A LOOPED TUBULE OP HENLE. (Disso.) The bend is accidental. s, end of spiral tubule; d, narrow descending limb of looped tubule of Henle. to be related to the production of secretion. The nuclei of the rodded cells are spherical, and the cells are closely united by a kind of dove-tailing (fig. 872) ; Fig. 87-1.—Section across a papilla op the kidney. (Cadiat.) a, ducts of Bellini; h, c,d, tubes of Henle, ascending and descending ; e,f, blood-capillaries. possibly they form a syncytium, but this is not certain. In some animals (e.g. mouse) the granular rodded epithelium is continued for a certain distance into the Malpighian corpuscle. The cells in the second convoluted tubules have a clearer appearance than those in the first. ^ Kolster, Ziegler’s Beitr. li. 1911.

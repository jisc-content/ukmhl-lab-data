678 INTERNALLY SECRETING GLANDS tube (fig. 981), which grows on each side from the third visceral pouches of the embryo (fig. 980, ih) and furnishes the first rudiments of the gland.' They therefore have a common origin with the Hassall corpuscles. The cells of the reticulum are large and clear in the medulla, and in places are arranged in close contact Fig. 979.—Medulla of thymus of kabbit. (Hammar.) A multinucleatecl giant-cell is seen in the reticulum. The small darkly stained bodies are the nuclei of lymphocytes. ^ The portions of thymus-tissue which occur in connexion with the thyroid (see p. 673) are also developed from the third pouch. It is possible that a part of the thymus may be derived from the fourth pouch. According to A. Zottermann the source of the thymus is different in dilTerent animals, in some being purely entodermic (man), in others purely ectodermic (mole), and in others of mixed origin (pig) (Anat. Anz. xxxviii. 1911). Fig. 978.—Medulla of thymus of fowl. (Hammar.) On the right is a cell which is partly transformed into striated muscle. Towards the left is a vesicle containing debris ; one of the cells bounding it is ciliated. Degenerated epithelium- cells like those of the Hassall corpuscles are scattered about.

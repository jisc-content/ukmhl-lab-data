STEUCTUKE OF TUBULES 597 tubide, and taking a transverse course towards tlie medullary ray, it finally enters one of the straight or collecting tubules, w\nch\e?ids to the medulla; these collecting tubules eventually join to form the ducts of Bellini.

Note the lobulated structure of the glomerulus. Structure of the tubules.—The basement-membrane enclosing the tubules appears in the fresh condition homogeneous ; nor does it in ordinary sections exhibit any structure. But, as was shown by Mall, it contains fine longitudinally and circularly disposed fibrils of reticular tissue, these fibrils being continuous with those of the intertubular tissue of the organ (see fig. 875). In addition to the fibrils the basement-membrane of the tubules is composed of a homogeneous material of a different nature, which resists the action of strong mineral acids. These are accordingly^used for macerating portions of the kidney when it is desired to isolate the tubules. The epithelium of the renal tubules varies in the different parts above described. It presents three distinct types. The cells of the first type are clear and columnar, without distinct granules or striae in the cytoplasm. Those of the second type are also clear, but flattened like the cells of an endothelium. Those of the third type are granular and striated from without inwards, the striations being most marked in the outer zone near the base of the cell, and the granular appearance most distinct in the inner zone ; next to the Fig. 870.—Section of a convoluted TUBULE OF the KABBIT’s KIDNEY, SHOWING THE STEUCTURE OF THE EPITHELIUM.

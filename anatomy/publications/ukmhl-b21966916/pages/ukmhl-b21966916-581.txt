MUSCULAEIS MUCOSiF^ 533 Besides the three above-described types of gland, in certain parts of the human stomach true crypts of Lieberkiihn occur (Schaffer), similar in all respects to those of the small intestine, and like these lined by typical columnar cells with striated border and with occasional goblet- cells between. The deepest cells also exhibit granules similar to those described by Paneth in the intestinal glands (Jouvenal). These crypts of Lieberkiihn are most numerous in a zone which lies between the area occupied by fundus glands and that occupied by pyloric glands, especially on the greater curvature. They are, however, found scattered amongst the glands both of the pyloric region and of the fundus, especially near the zone in question : a few occur quite close to the pylorus and to the cardia (6g. 765, cr). Where they are present the surface epithelium is also of the intestinal type. Muscularis mucosae.—Between the glands and at their base the mucous membrane consists of delicate connective tissue with retiform lymphoid tissue in Fig. 773.—Section through the stomach to show the arrangement or the rRiNCiPAU BLOOD-VESSELS IN RELATION TO ITS COATS. Diagrammatic. (S’. P. Mall.) On the right side of the figure the glandular and muscular elements are shown; on the left only the blood-vessels. It will be seen that the principal vessels are in the submucous tissue, and that from these, branches are distributed to the mucous membrane and to the muscular coat. For explanation of lettering see fig. 701. small amount. Externally a thin layer of plain muscular tissue {muscularis mucoscB, fig. 773, m.m.) bounds the mucous membrane, and separates it from the submucous tissue. It consists of two strata (an outer longitudinal and an inner circular), and is better marked in some animals than in man. Offsets pass from it between the gastric glands towards the surface of the mucous membrane.

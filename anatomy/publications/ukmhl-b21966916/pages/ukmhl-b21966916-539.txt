DENTINE 495 crusta fetrosa (see figs. 717, 720, 721, 722). The dentine constitutes by far the larger portion : the enamel is found only upon the exposed part or crown ; the cement covers with a thin layer the surface of the fang. Dentine.—This resembles bone in its aspect and general chemical constitu- tion, but is not identical with it in structure. The dentine of human teeth is composed of 28 parts per cent, of animal and 72 of earthy matter. The former is resolved into gelatin by boiling. The composition of the latter, Fig. 721.—Section of a human canine tooth, acboss the fang. (Sobotta.) Magnified 25 diameters. 2?, pulp-cavity ; d, dentine ; gr\ its granular layer ; c, cement. according to Bibra, is as follows: Phosphate of lime 66’7 per cent., carbonate of lime 3‘3, phosphate of magnesia and other salts, including a trace of fluoride of calcium, 1*8. Berzehus found 5*3 carbonate of lime. Dentine is penetrated throughout by fine tubes {dentine tubules), which, being nearly parallel, give it a striated aspect (figs. 721, 722). When a thin section of a macerated tooth, prepared by grinding, is viewed under the microscope by trans- mitted light, the solid substance, or matrix, is transparent and apparently homo- geneous, while the tubes, being (in a dried specimen) filled with air, are dark ; but

The lamellae which do not belong to the Haversian systems are distinguished from the Haversian lamellae under the general term of ground-lamellcB.

The appearance of a longitudinal section of the bone is in harmony with the account above given : the sections of the lamellae are seen as straight and parallel lines, running in the longitudinal direction of the bone, except when the section happens to have passed directly or slantingly across a canal : for wherever this occurs there is seen, as in a transverse section, a series of rings, generally oval and much lengthened on account of the obliquity of the section.

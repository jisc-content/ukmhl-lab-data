483 MAMMARY GLAND the secreting alveoli. They are regarded by most authors as detached epithelium- cells, but others consider them to be phagocytic leucocytes which have passed Fig. 699.—Section of human mammary gland during lactation.

The fat-globules are stained black by osmic acid. through the epithelium into the milk and taken the fatty globules into their interior. After lactation is over a general process of involution begins. The alveoli become atrophied and the glandular substance is again reduced to a small amount; but it is never so small as in the virgin condition. Here and there even in the active gland a certain number of lobules may be seen with their alveoli still in an undeveloped state (fig. 701). It is probable that as lactation progresses, the increasing demand made upon the gland during growth of the offspring will cause these also to undergo evolution. • ^The blood-vessels form a close network of capillaries investing the alveoli. The glands are supplied with blood by numerous branches of the in- ternal and external mammary arteries which ramify within the connective-tissue septa. The veins are partly deep, accompanying the arteries, partly superficial. The latter form a circular plexus Fig. 700.—An alveolus with fat-drops in cells. (v.

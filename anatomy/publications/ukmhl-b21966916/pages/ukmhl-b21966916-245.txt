SYNAPSES 213 and also with the cells of Clarke’s column in the spinal cord on cutting the fibres which emanate from them.^ Besides the basiphil granules of the Nissl bodies the cytoplasm of nerve-cells contains oxyphil granules,* wliich are not brought to view by the ordinary methods of staining, but are probably more constant in their occurrence than the basiphil granules. For, as has already been mentioned, the Nissl granules are by no means of constant occurrence in nerve-cells, a large number of these, especially in the cerebro-spinal centres, remainmg unstained (except their nuclei) by Nissl’s method. The change known as ‘ Wallerian degeneration/ which occurs in the peripheral part of the nerve- fibre when it is severed from the central part and cell-body will be subsequently referred to (see p. 245). Synapses. — Nerve-cells are not directly joined to one another by their cell-processes : indeed, there is strong evidence that every nerve- cell with all its processes is a distinct anatomical unit; this is the basis of the ‘ neurone-theory ’ of Waldeyer.-"^ The evidence is briefly as follows : (1) With certain methods of staining, especially that introduced by Golgi, and known by his name, a certain number of the nerve-cell bodies and all the processes which extend from them are intensely Fig. 326. — Dorsal root-fibres (A) SENDING COLLATERALS (B) TO FORM SYNAPSES (C, D, E) AROUND CELLS IN DORSAL HORN OF GREY MATTER OP SPINAL CORD.

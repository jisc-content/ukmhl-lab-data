()04 Ureter.—The walls of the ureter consist of an external fibrous coat or adventitia, three strata of plain muscular tissue, and a mucous membrane (fig. 880). The adventitia is a thin layer of connective tissue, which contains ramifications of the larger blood-vessels and nerves, Avith ganglia here and there, and in some subjects groups of fat-cells. Its connective tissue is freely continuous with that Avhich lies between the mus- cular bundles of the muscular coat. The mucous membrane, thin and smooth, shows a few longi- tudinal folds when the ureter is laid open or cut across in the upper part (fig. 881), but lower down in the pelvic part these folds disappear, and the section of the lumen is generally Y-shaped. The mucous membrane is com- posed of areolar tissue, which becomes gradually looser towards the muscular coat, but there is no distinction into mucous and sub- mucous layers. It is prolonged above to the pelvis of the kidney, and below becomes continuous with the lining membrane of the bladder. The epithelium, which is. 11 Fig. 880.—From a section of the wall of the pelvis OF kidney; human. (Disse.)

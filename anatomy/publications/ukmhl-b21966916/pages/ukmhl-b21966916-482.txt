SECRETING GLANDS 440 matter ; wliicli in some cases seems to be made up of granules, in others to be drawn out into threads, often spirally wound. The mass in question is known as a para- nucleus, and was first described for the secreting cell by Gaule ^ and Ogata ^ and by Nussbaum ^ in the pancreas, but has since been noticed in the salivary and lacrymal glands and elsewhere.'^ Apart from the question of the extrusion of a portion of its chromatin, the nucleus almost invariably undergoes enlargement during the activity of the secreting cell; an observation which indicates an access of meta- bolic activity. On the other hand the testimony of all observers is clear that there is no special tendency to nuclear and cell division during glandular activity ; this fact renders very improbable the bodily destruction of gland-cells as a concomitant of secretion—a supposition which was at one time prevalent, especially in regard to mucus-secreting glands. It is possible, however, that it may still apply to the sebaceous glands of the skin. ^ Centralbl. f. d. med. Wissensch. 1881. 1 2 Arch. f. Physiol. 1883. ^ Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xxi. 1882.

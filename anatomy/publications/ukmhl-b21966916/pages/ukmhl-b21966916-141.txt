DEVELOrMENT OF CONNECTIVE-TISSUE FIBRES 119 the cartilage-capsules; but although this renders it probable that the deposition of the granules is influenced by the cells, there is no evidence that they are formed by a direct conversion of the cell- protoplasm. Indeed, the subsequent extension of the fibres into those parts of the matrix which were previously clear of granules (a pro- cess which can be easily followed in the arytenoid cartilage of the calf) (fig. 222), and in which no such direct conversion of cell-protoplasm is possible, is a strong argument in favour of the hypothesis that the substance of these fibres is deposited in the intercellular substance. The view which supposes that a direct conversion of the proto- plasm of the connective-tissue cells takes place into fibres, both white and elastic, was for many years widely adopted, but it seems to rest largely upon a desire to interpret the facts in accordance with the conception (originally formulated by Lionel Beale and Fig. 194.—Development of elastic tissue by DEPOSITION OF FINE GRANULES. (Rauvier.) g, moniliform fibres formed by rows of ‘ elastin ’ granules; ]?, flat platelike expansion of elastic sub- stance formed by the fusion of ‘ elastin ’ granules.

Schultze), according to which every part of an organised body consists either of protoplasm (formative matter of Beale) or of material which has been protoplasm (formed material of Beale), the idea of a deposition or change occurring outside

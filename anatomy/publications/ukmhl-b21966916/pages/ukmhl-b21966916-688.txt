PENIS 630 pubis, they separate from each other in the form of two bulging and then tapering processes named crura (fig. 929, c c), which, extending backwards, are attached to the pubic and ischial rami, and are invested by the erectores penis or ischio- cavernosi muscles. The enlarged portions at the root, named by Kobelt the hulhs of the corpora cavernosa, attain a much greater proportionate development in some quadrupeds than in man. In front, the corpora cavernosa are closely bound Fig. 918.—P.'VBT of a section of one of the corpora cavernosa, in.jected from the DEEP ARTERY OF THE PENIS. (Henle.) On the left is seen the fibrous tissue; at *, a section of the arteria profunda penis. together into a blunt conical extremity, which is covered by the glans penis and firmly connected to its base by fibrous tissue. The under-surface of the united cavernous bodies is marked by a longitudinal groove, in which is lodged the corpus spongiosum. The upper or anterior surface is also marked with a slight median groove in which the dorsal vein of the penis is situated near the root; this surface is attached to the pubes by the suspensory ligament.

(Cadiat.) a, trabeculiB of connective tissue with many elastic fibres and bundles of plain muscular tissue, some of which are cut across (c); h, blood-sinuses. The median septum between the two corpora cavernosa is thick and complete near the root of the penis ; but further forward it becomes thinner, and only imperfectly separates their cavities, for it exhibits, particularly towards the anterior extremity, numerous clefts, extending from the dorsal to the urethral edge, and admitting of a free communication between the erectile tissue of the two sides. From the arrangement of these slits, the intermediate white portions of the

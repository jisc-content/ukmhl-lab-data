255 MOTO]{ END-ORGANS organ is however a more suitable one, for, as will immediately be explained, the termination of the nerve is rather of the nature of a flattened ramification than a continuous plate. As was mentioned in the account of muscular tissue, the nerves in voluntary muscles form plexuses, of which the branches grow liner and the meshes closer as they advance farther into the tissue. The individual fibres, while still associated in small bundles, undergo division, and at length single dark-bordered fibres pass off to the muscular fibres Fig. 391.—Ending op nerve-fibres IN CARDIAC MUSCLE.

These nerve-fibres on approaching or reaching a muscular fibre often divide still further. The branches retain their medullary sheath until they reach the sarcolemma, when the white substance abruptly terminates, while the a h Fig. 393.—Nerve-ending in muscular fibre of a lizard (Lacerta viridis).

Beneath this is granular protoplasm containing a number of large clear nuclei and constituting the ‘bed’ or ‘sole’ of the end-organ. In h the expansion of the axis-cylinder appears as a clear network, branching from the divisions of the medullated fibre. neurolemma becomes continuous with the sarcolemma (fig. 393, 5). It would seem that the prolongation of the nucleated sheath of Henle is also continued over the end-organ, which thus receives a double covering to which the name telolemma

204 THE NERVOUS TISSUES Fig. 309.—Closube of neubal gboove to fobm NEUBAL CANAL (HUMAN EMBBYO). (v. LenllOSSek.) A, canal open ; B, canal just closed. The cells at the roof of the closing canal are seen growing out on either side to form thickened masses which form the germs of the root-ganglia. Fig. 310.—Section op wall of neubal TUBE OF chick OF THBEE AND A-HALF DAYS. (Cajal.) G, germinal layer containing, A, neuro- blasts, of which 6 and c arc spheroidal, but already possess neuro-fibrils: from a the axon has begun to sprout; B, neuroblasts in a bipolar stage; d, enlarged end of axon of one of these neuroblasts; e, another axon growing tangentially. Fig. 311.—Ependymal epithelium of spinal cobd of embbyo. (v. Lenhossek.) Stained by Golgi method. Only a few of the ependymal cells arc stained. In the grey matter four neuroglia-cells are represented.

THE OEGANS OF EEPKODUCTION. The generative glands consist in the male sex of the testicles, which produce the spermatozoa ; in the female sex of the ovaries, which produce the ova. The accessory generative organs in the male sex comprise the j)enis or organ of intro- mission, and various expansions and modifications of the ducts of the testicles, viz. : the epididymis, the vas deferens with its ampulla, the seminal vesicles, the ejaculatory ducts, the prostate, the urethra with Coivper’s glands, besides certain rudimentary organs, such as the organ of Giraldes, the hydatids of Morgagni, and the prostatic vesicle. The accessory organs in the female sex are the oviducts or I epider mis cutis vera subcutis (' stratum iuter- medium tunica vaginalis comm. tunica vaginalis propr.

The urethra opens in the female at the upper part of the vulva, and although it does not, as in the male sex, transmit the secretion of the generative as well as that of the urinary glands, it may nevertheless be described most conveniently with the organs of generation. MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS. THE TESTICLES. The testicles are contained within a purse-like sac of integument, known as the scrotum. The skin of this (fig. 886) is very thin and of a dark colour ; it is commonly thrown into rugin or folds, which are more or less marked according to the extent of contraction of the plain muscular tissue, fine bundles of which are present in it in

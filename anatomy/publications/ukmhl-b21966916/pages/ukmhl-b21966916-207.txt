MINUTE STRUCTURE 179 of sarcoplasm between them, some having a very large amount of sarcoplasm, others very little, so that in these the interfibrillar substance is almost invisible. When a muscular fibre is examined in the fresh condition in serum, fine longi- tudinal lines are seen, as before mentioned, running through the cross striae (see fig. 271). Under favourable conditions, and especially after the action of weak acid, which swells the muscular substance and renders it clearer and more trans- parent, these lines become more distinct and can be traced from end to end of Fig. 276.—Transyebse section of a leg-muscle FIBBE OF DyTISCUS, SHOWING BADIAL AKKANGE- MENT OF SAKCOPLASM AND SAKCOSTYLES. (Schiifer.) The nuclei of insect-muscle lie in a proto- plasmic mass in the middle of the fibre. The lines re- present the sarcoplasm, the clear intervals between, the radial columns of fibrils.

(Schafer.) the fibre (figs. 272, 277, 278, 279). By careful focussing it can be made out that the lines are the optical section of the planes of separation between the sarcostyles ; that is to say, they are the optical efiect of the interfibrillar substance or sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm, then, has, in transverse section of the fibre, the Fig. 277.—Leg-muscle fibre of Harpalus RUFICOBNIS TREATED WITH DILUTE ACID, SHOWING A TENDENCY TO BREAK ACROSS INTO DISCS. (Schafer.) The sarcoplasm is in the form of fine lines. The ordinary dark stripes of the fibre have disappeared in the acid. Fig. 278.—Part of a leg-muscle fibre of Vespa fixed with alcohol and after- wards STAINED. (Schiifer.) The rows of sarcous elements which form the dark stripes are stained (S.E.); the sarco- plasm has the usual appearance of longitudinal lines and dots. The lines produced by the juxtaposed membranes of Ki’ause are just visible (K.). appearance of a network ; in longitudinal optical section the appearance of fine parallel lines ; both these appearances are exhibited in the disc shown in fig. 275. It may easily be understood how these two effects would be produced by the presence of a small amount of interstitial substance lying between closely packed prismatic columns. N 2

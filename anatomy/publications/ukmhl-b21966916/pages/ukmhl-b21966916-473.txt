BASEMENT-MEMBRANES 431 Basement-membranes of g^lands {membrancB profrice).—In most glands the secreting cells of the alveoli and also the cells which line the ducts are bounded externally, i.e. are separated from the connective tissue of the gland, by a thin mem- brane, which is sometimes continuous, sometimes interrupted, and which has nuclei scattered here and there upon it (fig. 637). This is the basement-membrane, and, as the presence of the nuclei indicate, it is composed of more or less fused flattened cells of connective-tissue nature, which are sometimes united edge to edge, some- times connected only by branched processes, so as to form a sort of flattened basket- work around the alveoli. Even in this case the meshes of the basket-work are not quite empty, being occupied by a delicate filmy membrane, which, according Fig. 636.—Connective tissue of a salivary gland (sublingual, man), displayed after REMOVAL OF THE GLAND-CELLS AND OTHER TISSUES BY TRYPTIC DIGESTION.

The gland is of the mixed type, one part being composed of mucous alveoli, the other part of serous alveoli. a, artery ; v, vein; d, main duct; i, connective tissue accompanying the vessels and duct; Im, a lobule of the mucous portion ; Is, a lobule of the serous portion (with smaller alveoli) ; m, m, interlobular septa. to Flint,^ is a condensation of the reticular connective tissue. The basement- membrane cells may also send flattened branches into the interior of the alveolus, penetrating between the secreting-cells and helping to keep them in place (Boll, V. Ebner). Processes which actually penetrate into the protoplasm of the cells are also described by Holmgren {trophospongium, see p. 26). ^ Arch. f. Anat. 1903. See also Amer. Journ. Anat. i. 1901 and ii. 1902.

MEDULLA TED FIBRES 231 From the above description it will be seen that a peripheral nerve-fibre consists of (1) the axis-cylinder 01 axon in the centre, (2) the inyelin oi medullary sheath next Fig. 361.—White ok medullated nerve-fibres, showing the sinuous outline and DOUBLE contours. (Bidder and Volkmann.) Fig. 362.—Fine medullated fibres from the root of a spinal nerve. (Valentin.) At a the fibres have been dragged upon in process of teasing and have become varicose. Fig. 363.—A small part of a medullated fibre highly magnified. Half diagrammatic. (Schafer.) The fibre looks in optical section like a tube—hence the term tubular, formerly applied to these fibres. Two partial breaches of continuity are seen in the medullary sheath, which at these places exhibits a tendency to split into laminse. The neurolemma is here and there apparent outside the medullary sheath, and the delicate strife which are visible in the middle of the fibre indicate the fibrillated axis-cylinder. n Fig. 364.—Portion of a fresh medullated nerve-fibre from sciatic of cat. (Schafer.) Magnified 600 diameters. Three of Schmidt’s intersegmental clefts are shown, and also the situation of a nucleus of the neurolemma [n). to the axon,’ and (3) the nucleated membranous sheath {neurolemma) most external (figs. 359 to 365). In the nerve-fibres which still lie within the nerve-centres, and which constitute the whole of the white substance of the brain and spinal cord, the membranous sheath is absent. These alemmal myelinated fibres are far less tough, and therefore more difficult to isolate to any length than those of the nerve-roots and of the peripheral nerves, which are provided with neurolemma ; ^ Donaldson and Hoke (Journ. Comp. Neurol. 1905) find that in every nerve the sectional areas of axon and medullary sheath are about equal to one another, coarser fibres having a thicker, and finer fibres a jiroportionally thinner sheath. - a, jirivative ; Ae/X/ua, sheath.

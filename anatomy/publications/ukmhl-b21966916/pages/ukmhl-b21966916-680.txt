TESTICLE G22 Fig. 905.—a cell of Ser- toli WITH WHICH THE SPERMATIDS (THREE OP WHICH ARE SHO^VN) ARE BEGINNING TO BE CON- NECTED ; HUMAN. (Bramman.) The cell contains glo- bules (of nutritive sub- stance) staining with osmic acid, and similar but smaller globules are also seen in the spermatids. A ‘ ring ’ is usually formed around the tail filament by one of the particles of the (double) centrosome; this is shown in each of these spermatids close to the ‘ head.’ Fig. 906.—Diagram exhibiting the cycle of phases of sperma- togenesis IN THE rat. (Schafer.) (This diagram is founded upon the drawings of H. H. Brown.) a, spermatogonia, seen dividing in 6; a', cells of Sertoli; h, spermatocytes, with skein-like nuclear filaments : these cells are seen actively dividing in 5 ; c, spermatids forming an irregular column or clump in 6, 7, 8, and 1, and connected to Sertoli cell, a', in 2, 3, 4, and 5. In 6, 7, and 8, advanced spermatozoa of one crop are seen between columns of spermatids of the next crop, s', parts of the spermatids which disappear when the spermatozoa are fully formed; s, seminal granules, probably resulting from the disintegration of s'; a", in 1 and 2, are Sertoli cells which are probably becoming atrophied.

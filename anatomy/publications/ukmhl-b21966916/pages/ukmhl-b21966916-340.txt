304 STRUCTURE OF NERVE-CENTRES Ventral to the reticular formation of the pons is a flattened mass of white fibres which is continued up from the tract of the fillet of the medulla oblongata ; this is the lower or main fillet. Its fibres are largely derived from the nuclei of the posterior columns of the bulb, having crossed the raphe mainly in the middle and lower parts of the medulla oblongata. But this is not the only source of the fibres of the main fillet, for they receive accessions from all the sensory nuclei of the pons and bulb and probably also from fibres derived from the grey matter of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The main fillet passes up into the mid-brain, and for the most part goes past this to end in the thalamus.

Photograph. (Schafer.) On each side of the narrowing upper end of the fourth ventricle are seen in sections across the uppermost part of the pons a considerable bundle of white fibres- which, when followed downwards, is seen to be traceable out of a wavy nucleus (fig. 475 n.d.) of grey matter within the cerebellar hemisphere of the same side. This bundle is the superior cerebellar peduncle. Traced forwards it is found to dip gradually down until it comes to lie in the reticular formation ventral to the central grey matter, and here it is seen in the lower part of the mid-brain to decussate with its fellow in the middle line, forming a large round white bundle within

But the ganglia upon the vestibular and cochlear divisions of the eighth nerve d Fig. 377.—Longitudinal section through the middle of a ganglion on the posterior ROOT OF ONE OF THE SACRAL NERVES OF THE DOG, AS SEEN UNDER A LOW MAGNIFYING POWER. (Schafer.) a, Nerve-root entering the ganglion; &, fibres leaving the ganglion to join the mixed spinal nerve; c, connective-tissue coat of the ganglion ; d, principal group of nerve-cells, with fibres passing down from amongst the cells, to unite with the longitudinally coursing T-shaped nerve- junctions (see text). Fig. 378.—From a longitudinal section of spinal ganglion of dog. (Schafer.) Magnified 226 diameters. The difference in size and appearance of the ganglion-cells is noticeable. The nuclei of the sheath-cells are also clearly visible. (ganglion of Scarpa and ganglion of the cochlea) retain their bipolar condition throughout life.^ 1 The microscopical characters of the spinal-ganglion cells have already been considered (pp. 221, 222). For numerous details regarding them, see S. Hatai, Biol. Bull. iii. 11)02 ; Deceun. Publ. of Univ. of Chicago, 1903; and Jouni. Comp. Neurol, xii. xiii. and xiv. 1902 and 1903 ; Lugax’O, Riv. d. pat. nerv. e ment. v. vi. vii. and viii.; Warrington and Griffith, Brain, 1904 ; Warrington, iZyb?. 1904 ; Cajal, Textura del sistema nervioso, 1904, and Trabajos, &c. iv. 1905; Hardesty, Journ. Comp. Neurol. 1905 (frog). According to Donaldson and Hatai, many of the cells of the spinal ganglia possess no processes ; these are probably cells which have never become fully developed. A. S. Dogiel, who has published a monogra)jh on this subject (Bau der Spiiialganglicn, Fischer, 1908), describes eleven types of cell in these ganglia, one being multipolar. He regards the free nerve-endings over the cells as the terminations of sensory or of sympathetic filxres. VOL. II. PART I. R

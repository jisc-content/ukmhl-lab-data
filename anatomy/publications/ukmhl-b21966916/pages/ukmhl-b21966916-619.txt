COURSE OF BLOOD IN LIVER 5G5 between the lobnles, separating them more or less from one another.’ The blood is conveyed in this way to branches of the portal vein, which run everywhere between the lobules—hence termed interlobular veins ; these deliver it into a net- FiG. 824.—D1.A.GRAMMATIC REPRESENTATION OP TWO HEPATIC LOBULES. (SchiifeT.) The left-hand lobule is represented with the intralobular vein cut across; in the right-hand one the section takes the course of the intralobular vein, p, interlobular branches of the portal vein; h, intralobular branches of the hepatic veins ; s, sublobular vein; c, capillaries of the lobules. The arrows indicate the direction of the course of the blood. The liver-cells are only represented in one part of each lobule. work of capillary blood-spaces which pervade the lobules and converge towards the centre of each lobule to form a central or intralobular vein (fig. 824). This carries the blood out of the lobule into sublobular veins, which course through the liver in Fig. 825.—Cross-section of a lobule of the human liver, in which the capillary NETWORK BETWEEN THE INTERLOBULAR AND CENTRAL VEINS HAS BEEN FULLY INJECTED. (Sappey.) Magnified 60 diameters. 1, section of the intralobular or central vein ; 2, its smaller branches collecting blood from the capillary network; 3, interlobular or peripheral branches of the vena portoe with their smaller ramifications passing inwards to join the capillary network in the substance of the lobule. contact with the lobules, but altogether apart from the capsule of Glisson and its vessels. The sublobular veins unite to form larger vessels, which ultimately leave the ^ In some animals [e.g. pig) the lobules are completely separated from one another by the inter- lobular connective tissue.

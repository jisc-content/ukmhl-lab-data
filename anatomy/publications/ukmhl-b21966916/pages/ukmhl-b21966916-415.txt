DEVELOPI\[ENT OF ERYTHROCYTES IN THE EMBRYONIC LIVER 879 The genetic relationship which obtains between the blood-elements is tentatively shown in the following scheme : Primitive erythroblast I Primitive erythrocyte Hsemoblast (mesenchyme-cell) Megaloblast 1 Normoblast 1 Erythroblast Erythrocj^te Lymphoblast Lymphocyte 1 Leucocyte Myeloblast I Myelocyte Leucocyte B. Formation in the liver. When the liver begins to develop it becomes an important source of production of blood-corpuscles. These are formed (fig. 571) Fig. 571.—Formation op erythroblasts in liver op embryo-rabbit. (Maximow.) en, en', en'\ endothelial cells of vessels (one of these, en'\ contains a large haemo- globin-coloured globule); «, megaloblasts; a', megaloblast in mitosis ; 6, normoblasts; c, erythroblasts; I, lymphoblasts; V, lymphoblast in mitosis; //, hepatic cell; n, a nucleus becoming extruded from a small erythroblast. by multiplication of the hsemoblasts and erythroblasts which are circulating within its sinus-like vessels,' partly, perhaps, from primitive blood-cells which are derived from its mesenchyme and which wander into these sinuses and there undergo development into erythroblasts and leucocytes.^ Some are described as ^ Kostanecki, Anat. Hefte, i. 1891 ; Saxer, ibid. vi. 1896; Maximow, cit.; Jordan, op. cit. ^ Maximow {op. cit.) states that such changes occur outside the vessels in the liver tissue. A similar statement is made by Mollier, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. Ixxiv. 1909

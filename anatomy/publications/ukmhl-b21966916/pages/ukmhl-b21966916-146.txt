THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES 124 tissues, in spite of the fact that lymphocytes may occur in largo numbers in the meshes of the cell-reticulum. Another epithelial (ectodermic) tissue which simulates reticular connective tissue is that of the enamel organ of Fig. 203.—End of a fibrous trabecula from the same PREPARATION, SHOWING THE CONTINUITY OF THE CON- NECTIVE-TISSUE FIBRILS WITH THE RETICULUM.

In certain situations the meshes of the retiform tissue are occupied by numerous corpuscles which closely resemble the lymphocytes of the blood and lymph. They are here known as lym'ph-cells, and the tissue containing them is termed lymphoid or adenoid tissue (fig. 204). This tissue is found composing the greater part of the lymph-glands, and other structures allied to them, such as the solitary and agminated glands of the intestine, and the similar structures in the tonsils and elsewhere. Moreover, the alimentary mucous membrane is in some parts permeated by the same tissue, and it occurs also in other mucous membranes and, in the form either of elongated tracts or of isolated nodules, in many parts of the Fig. 204.—Lymphoid tissue from medulla of lymph-gland of dog.

In parts of the spleen and in certain other organs known as haemal lymph-glands the interstices of the retiform tissue are occupied by blood, instead of by lymph. Like the white fibres of connective tissue, the fibres of

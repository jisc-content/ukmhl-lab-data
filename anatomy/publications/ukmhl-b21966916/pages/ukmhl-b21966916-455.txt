413 LYMPITATTCS OF SPLEEN extravasation of blood into the pnlp is artificial, and that there is a closed circulation in the organ. This opinion is still hold by some modern writers on the spleen. The lymphatics of the spleen form two systems, a tvahecular and a perivascular. The vessels belonging to the former system run in the trabeculae and are in com- munication with a superficial network in the capsule. The perivascular lymphatics take origin in the lymphoid tissue which has already been noticed as ensheathing the smaller arteries, and forming the Malpighian corpuscles. After leaving the Fig. 615.â€”From a section op spleen of monkey, showing the longitudinal and CIRCULAR FIBRES OF THE WALLS OF THE VENOUS SINUSES OP THE PULP. (S. Mollier.) Two sinuses are shown as well as some of the reticular cells and fibres of the pulp. One of the sinuses is cut obliquely, and a branch from it is partly seen in longitudinal section; the other one is cut almost exactly transversely, so that the longitudinal fibres of its wall are cut across and appear as a row of dots. Notice the prominent nuclei of the endothelium-cells. lymphoid tissue the lymphatics commonly run in pairs, one on either side of an artery, uniting over it by frequent anastomoses, and sometimes partially or wholly enclosing it. At the hilum the two sets of lymphatics join one another and proceed along with the main blood-vessels, ultimately passing into lymph-glands at the back of the abdomen. The above description of the course of the lymphatics applies rather to the spleen of animals than that of man, in which lymphatics have not been followed into the interior of the organ, except near the hilum.

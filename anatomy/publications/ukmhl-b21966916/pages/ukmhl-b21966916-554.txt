Tomes, fig. 742, T). The layer is produced simultaneously with or immediately after the first layer of pro- dentine, against which it is applied. Before long it is converted into a fibrous formation (fig. 744, /) : a change reminiscent of the process of keratinisation of the epidermis. Presently the fibrous layer thus formed under- goes calcification, and the first cap of enamel is then complete. The ameloblasts next pro- duce a second layer of keratin-like material, which also undergoes fibrillation, and from this, after calcification, another stratum of enamel is formed, and so 011.^ As with the dentine, the formation of enamel appears first at the apex of each cusp, so that there are as many caps as cusps ; these eventually become blended. The ameloblasts gradually retire as the successive layers of enamel are being pro- duced by them, and this retiral goes on as long as the formation of enamel continues— that is to say, until the crown of the tooth is completed. In the meantime the enamel- pulp gradually diminishes, and eventually almost disappears. The remainder of the enamel-organ forms a thin epithelial cap over the crown, but this cap soon • ^ J.

STRUCTUKE OF CELL 14 material is accompanied bj’’ the assumption of the property of double refraction, due to the linear arrangement of the molecules of the colloid. Thus much being premised regarding the effects produced by reagents upon colloidal solutions, such as unquestionably exist in ceU-protoplasm, we are in a better position to form a judgment respecting the structural appearances which have been described as characteristic of this substance. THE STRUCTURE OF CELL-PROTOPLASM. It is obvious from what has been stated regarding the action of fixative reagents upon colloid solutions, that it would be improper to infer the pre-existence of Fig. 13.—Successive changes exhibited by an amceba. (Verworn.) The protoplasm appears completely structureless, although containing granules near the nucleus and a contractile vacuole. structure in protoplasm unless such structure can be shown to be present under the normal conditions of the living organism. An organism which has always been regarded as typically protoplasmic is the unicellular and uninuclear animalcule A B Fig. 14a. — Diagram of a cell, the PROTOPLASM OF WHICH IS STRUC- TURELESS, ALTHOUGH OCCUPIED BY VACUOLES AND GRANULES. protoplasm ; nucleus ; ii', nucleolus.

This can be easily examined in the living condition. It is capable of performing all necessary functions of the animal organism, including

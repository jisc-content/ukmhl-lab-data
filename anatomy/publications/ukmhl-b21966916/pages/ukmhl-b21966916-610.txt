55G LARGE INTESTINE with one another, form the hsemorrhoidal plexus. The arrangement of the lymphatics is nearly the same as in the small intestine. Scattered over the whole of the large intestine are found lymph-follicles, similar to the solitary glands of the small intestine. They are most numerous in the caecum and its vermiform appendix, being placed closely all over the latter; their abundance constituting the chief characteristic of this diverticulum (fig. 810). The richness in lymph-vessels varies in different parts. They are most numerous in the caecum and become less abundant in the lower parts. The efferent lymph- vessels pass partly to the coeliac, partly to the lumbar glands ; those from the appendix enter the ileo-caecal and ileo-colic glands. A connexion is observed Fig. 810.â€”Transvekse section of vermiform APPENDIX. (G. Mann.) between the lymph-vessels of the caecum and ascending colon (and sometimes of the appendix) and the superficial lymphatics of the right kidney.^ Nervous plexuses similar to those of the small intestine are found in the muscular and submucous coats of the large intestine. They receive nerve-fibres from the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses of the sym- pathetic and also, in the lower part, from the anterior roots of the second and third sacral nerves. These last differ from those derived from the sympathetic by passing into the coats of the gut without having previously lost the medullary sheath. ^ K. Franke, Arch. f. Anat. 1910. According to Lockwood (Journ. Anat. and Physiol, xxxiv. 1900) some lymph-vessels pass from the appendix to glands in the iliac fossa and to others which adjoin the external and internal iliac arteries.

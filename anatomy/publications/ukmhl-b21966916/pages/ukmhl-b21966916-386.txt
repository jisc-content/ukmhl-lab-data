BLOOD-VESSELS 350 A peculiar arrangement of non-striped muscle is found in the meshlike blood-vessels of the skate, in uhich the muscle, instead of forming a continuous coat, appears as well defined Fig. 537. — Eing-like arrangement of MUSCLE AROUND VESSELS OF SKATE. (Maim.) (From a preparation by P. Meyer.) rings (P. Meyer) (fig. 5.37). In the mesentery of the macaque monkejq and occasionally also in the rabbit, the mesenteric veins show non- striped muscle arranged as a separate bundle running along one side of the vessel (fig. 539). The only open communication between the arteries and the veins is by means of capillary vessels, and in certain cases by sinusoids, as above described; except that in the maternal part of the placenta, in the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (Ranvier) (fig. 539), and in the interior of erectile organs small arteries oiien directly into wide venous cavities without the intervention of capil- laries ; in the mesentery also small arteries may open directly into small veins. In the sjileen (fig. 540), the arterial capillaries do not at once pass into the commencements of the veins, but Fig. 538.—Small venule and blood-capill.aries in the mesentery of a monkey, showing BAND OF NON-STRIPED MUSCLE RUNNING ALONGSIDE THE VENULE.

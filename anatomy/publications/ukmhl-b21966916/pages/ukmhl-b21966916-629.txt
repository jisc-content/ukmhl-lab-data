GALL-BLADDER 57o Glisson, in which they form a network of anastomosing tubules. All these glands and diverticula are lined by columnar epithelium, amongst which are found a varying number of goblet-cells. The g'S'll-bladder has a mucous membrane internally, lined with columnar cells (fig. 836) : this membrane is commonly thrown into folds (rugae), some of which near the neck are permanent. Externally to the mucous membrane are a fibrous and a muscular coat, with a considerable amount of elastic tissue. The liver is the only gland of the alimentary canal provided with a reservoir in which secre- tion can be stored in the intervals of its discharge. Some animals are destitute of a gall-bladder. The epithelium of the gall-bladder resembles on the whole that which lines the small intestine (fig. 836, B), and is usually stated to have a similar striated border. The cells secrete mucus. According to Sobotta and Sommer * the appear- ance of a border is produced by mucin-droplets, which are also seen in the greater part of the cell-body. The nuclei lie near the base of the cells. Agata - has described a net-like structure within the cells lining the gall-bladder similar ta that which has been noticed in other columnar epithelium-cells (see p. 25). ^ Verhaiidl. d. Anat.

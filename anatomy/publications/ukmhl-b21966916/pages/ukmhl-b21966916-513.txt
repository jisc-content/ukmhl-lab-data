MUSCLES AND NERVES 469 Fig. 680.— Longitudinal section of a hair-follicle. (Schafer.) Magnified 200 diameters. 0, outer, i, inner root-sheath ; h, hair ; x, part shown magnified in fig. 681. be attached to several follicles (Hesse). In some parts a muscular slip is sent more deeply into the integument and becomes attached to the connective tissue enclosing a sweat-gland. Nerves of the hairs (figs. 682, 683, 684).—A nerve-fibre passes to each hair follicle, and others, as already remarked, enter the papilla. The one to the follicle arises from the nerves to the adjacent part of the cutis and enters the dermic coat just below the sebaceous glands (fig. 682). Its branches pass in a ring-like manner the corium, and join to form a somewhat flattened and plexiform muscle which passes down obliquely to be inserted into the outside of the follicle below the sebaceous glands, which they in a measure embrace in their passage. In the dermic coat of the follicle some of the muscular fibres become transverse, and partly encircle the lower part of the follicle. They are placed on the side to which the hair-follicle slants, so that their action in elevating the hair is evident. When the hairs are in groups, as in the scalp, one muscle may divide as it passes to its insertion, and may

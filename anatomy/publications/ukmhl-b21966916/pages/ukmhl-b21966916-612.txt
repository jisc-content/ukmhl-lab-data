558 PANCKEAS The ducts are lined with a simple layer of long columnar epithelium, the cells becoming shorter and more cubical in the smaller ducts. They do not exhibit the well-marked longitudinal striation met with in the duct-cells of some of the salivary glands. The ultimate branches of the ducts connected with the alveoli are much narrowed, and are lined with flattened cells; in optical section these cells appear spindle-shaped. Interalveolar islet.

Magnified 450 diameters. The pancreas, altkougli in general structure similar to the salivary glands, shows important difierences of detail. It secretes no mucus, but an albuminous fluid, and is therefore reckoned amongst serous glands. In certain respects it resembles tire parotid gland. Thus in shape its alveoli are in man very similar to those of the parotid, i.e. they are nearly spherical, although in both cases from A. B. Fig. 812.—An alveolus of the rabbit’s pancreas at rest and in activitv. (Kiiline and Lea.) A. , during rest, tlie cells loaded with granules, and the inner zone, a, large, and the outer zone, b, narrow. B. , after activity, the inner zone small, and the outer zone large and distinctly striated. The cell outlines are also now visible, c, lumen of alveolus; d, basement-membrane. mutual compression the spherical shape may be converted into a rounded angular form ; moreover, during rest they are almost completely filled by the secreting cells. The general appearance of the cells is also similar to those of the parotid, except that there is always in each secreting cell of the pancreas, even

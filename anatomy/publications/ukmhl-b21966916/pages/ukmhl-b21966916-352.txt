316 STRUCTUEE OF NERVE-CENTRES than the rest, and its pyramid-cells—at least those of the hippocampus proper— are in one layer only, as is the case in the whole of the cortex of the lowest vertebrata. In the dentate gyrus, which adjoins the hippocampus, all the cells are very small. But in the hippocampal gyrus, which bounds the hippocampus on the other side, and also belongs to the olfactory area, the layers of cells are much more numerous. This gyrus is characterised by the presence of groups or islets of cells in its more superficial layers (fig. 491). The structure of the olfactory bulb has already been noticed (fig. 459).^ r • * ' ■yj, • --- . o « / ^ . . V. - * S'- fc* ^ \, • o® ® ^ o'o . «|si ^ g,. 2 .d « 0 o o”« 0 i?oT , c slo- »' . «* th.

A, islet of small cells ; B, islet of large cells; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, successive layers of the cortex. The fibres which arise from the cells of the cerebral cortex and pass into its white centre take various directions (fig. 492). Some go as projection-fibres into the internal capsule, and from this either into the grey masses of the corpus striatum and thalamus, or, passing through the internal capsule, are continued down in the crusta of the mid-brain. Some end in the grey matter of that part, 1 A detailed account of the structure of the several areas of the cerebral cortex is given in Neurology (Vol. III. Part I. of this work).

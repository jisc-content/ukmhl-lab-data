These protrusions {pseudopodia) may be presently withdrawn again and others given out, or a pseudopodium which has been protruded at any one part of the corpuscle may extend itself further, and the main part or body of the Fig. 101.—An amoeboid leucocyte of Triton blood, photographed whilst LIVING.

The polymorphous nucleus can be detected within the cytoplasm. corpuscle may pass gradually towards and into the extending pseudopodium. By a repetition of this process the cell may glide slowly away from its original situation, and move bodily along the field of the microscope, so that locomotion thereby Fig. 102.—Untouched photograph of leucocyte of Triton, fixed whilst in AMOEBOID CONDITION BY JET OF STEAM DIRECTED ON TO COVER-GLASS, STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN.

In this manner some of the white corpuscles, while the blood is circu- lating, pass through the walls of the capillaries and minute veins and find their way into the surrounding connective tissue, where they may further continue to exhibit amoeboid movements.

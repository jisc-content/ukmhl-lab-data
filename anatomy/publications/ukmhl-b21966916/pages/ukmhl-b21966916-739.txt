677 THYMUS There is evidence of mitotic division of the thymus leucocytes, but there are no distinct germ-centres in the lymphoid tissue such as occur in the lymph-glands and spleen. The reticulum of the thymus (figs. 977 to 979) difiers from that of the lymph- glands in being essentially formed of a syncytium of branched cells. These are not mesodermicbut entodermic, being formed from proliferated cells of the epithelial ^ Arch. f. niikr. Amit. Ixiii. 1904. Each nest is composed of an envelope of keratinised epithelium-like cells enclosing a central mass, formed of one or more granular cells, which may have undergone degeneration. Cells like those in the centre of the nest are also found, unenclosed, in the retiform tissue of the follicle, and occasionally attain a large size. The amount of the Hassall corpuscles does not necessarily remain constant in the same thymus. Wallis found the total volume of Hassall corpuscles to increase after birth.* Fig. 977.—Section of medulla op thymus of human fcetus, 70 mm. in length, showing BRANCHED CELLS OF RETICULUM, WITH A FEW LYMPHOCYTES IN ITS MESHES.

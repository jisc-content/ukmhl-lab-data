239 STRUCTURE OF NERVE-TRUNKS connective-tissue cells. Altliougli the lamellae are in contact with one another, it is possible to force injection material between them, and this may then find its wav along the funiculus for a considerable distance. The intervals between the lamellae represent, therefore, potential lymph-spaces, and it has been shown by Key and Retzius that at the nerve-roots, where these leave the skull and neural canal, the cerebro-spinal fluid, which fills most of the room within these cavities which is not occupied by the brain and cord, can pass into and along these clefts in the perineurium, and can thus drain slowly away towards the periphery along the nerves. The regular arrangement of the lamellae of the perineurium gives place within the funiculus to a looser tissue, which occupies the interstices between the nerve- Fig. 375.â€”Section of a funiculus of the sciatic nerve of man.

It consists in the main of fine longitudinally disposed white fibres running between and amongst the nerve-fibres, and serves to support these and to conduct amongst them the relatively small number of capillary blood-vessels which are supplied to the interior of each funiculus. There are also a few connective-tissue cells. A nerve may consist of but a single funiculus, containing few or many nerve-fibres. Even nerve-fibres which are running singly to their destination are invested by a sheath which is continuous with the funicular sheath of the nerve-trunk or nerve-branch from which the fibre has been derived. Such a

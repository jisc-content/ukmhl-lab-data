Lymphatics have been described in the pulp; they also occur in the periodontal membrane.^ Od Od' Fig. 719.—Section across the root of a young tooth showing the pulp in situ. (Edse.)

The hard part of a tooth is composed of three distinct substances—viz. the proper dental substance, known as ivory or dentine, the enamel, and the cement or ^ Law fProc. Roy. Soc. Med. i. 1908) states that he has succeeded in following fibrils into the tubules. Howard Mummery (private communication) has also shown nerve-fibrils passing from the marginal plexus into the tubules and has traced them into all parts of the dentine, even close to the surface. It is difficult to undei’stand the extreme sensitiveness of dentine, especially wdien inflamed, unless we assume the presence of nerve-fibrils in it. ^ G. Schweitzer, Arch. f. mikr. Anat.

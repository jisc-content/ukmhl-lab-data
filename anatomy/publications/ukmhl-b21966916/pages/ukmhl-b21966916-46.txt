STRUCTUKE OF CELL 26 of a paranucleus (see p. 16).' Well-marked canaliculi also occur in the liver-cells (fig. 44), where they may occasionally contain blood-corpuscles in stages of disin- tegration ^: these are capable of being injected from the portal vessels (fig. 45),-^ thus indicating that in this organ there is a very intimate relationship between the blood-vessels and the cells of the tissue. Holmgren'* has described the canaliculi of Fig. 45.—From a section of rabbit’s LIVER INJECTED FROM THE PORTAL VEIN, SHOWING INTRACELLULAR CANALICULI COMMUNICATING WITH THE INTERCEL- LULAR BLOOD-SINUSOIDS.

STEUCTURE OF CELL-BODY 219 has been described by Golgi * in the body of the nerve-cell (figs. 337, 338). This network appears to contain myelin ; it is darkly stained by prolonged treatment with osmic acid.*-^ Golgi has also described in some nerve-cells a reticular investment ^ covering the cell-body which may extend a certain distance over the cell-processes (fig. 339). The exact nature of this investment is not clear. According to some authorities it is formed by an interlacement of the terminal ramifications of axons proceed- ing from other cells to form synapses with the cell-body (see p. 215). Others believe it to have a neuroglial origin.'* Another appearance which has been described within many nerve-cells, especially those of the spinal ganglia, consists of ramified canals, which are occupied, according to Holmgren,** by branching processes from the cells lining the capsule (trophospongium, see p. 27). Holmgren believes that these processes may be amoeboid, and that the canals they occupy may therefore be constantly undergoing change. Some nerve-cells also have in the immediate neighbourhood of the nucleus a clump of pigment- granules (fig. 340), yellow, brown, or black in colour.

A, larger ; B, smaller cell; a, a, folds in network; h, a ring- like condensation ; c, projections from surface. in many cells of the same locality they give a distinctive colour to the part, as in the substantia nigra of the mid-brain and the locus coeruleus of the fourth ventricle. The pigment contains lecithin. It tends to increase in amount with age, although it is already seen during the third year of life.*^ It is more extensively met with in man than in the lower animals. According to the number of processes which they possess, nerve-cells are termed unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar. Unipolar nerve-cells are met with in the ’ Arch. ital. de biol. xxx. 1898; Verhandl. d. anat. Gesellsch., Anat. Anz. xviii. 1901. See also Rossi, Le Nevraxe, vi. 1904.

In most parts the glands are numerous, but they become rarer in the cystic duct, near the Fig. 835.—Section across hepatic duct. (v. Ebner.) Magnified 16 diameters.

Besides these true glands there occur diverticula of varying size and length leading off from the hepatic duct and its larger branches, which ramify in the connective tissue of the capsule of

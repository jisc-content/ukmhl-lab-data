They are distinguished by the name of articular end-bulbs. Fig. 413.—A double end-bulb fkom the human peeitoneum. Methylene-blue preparation. (Dogiel.)

Methylene-blue preparation. (Dogiel.) Besides the main nerve-fibre, which is medullated, and ends in the core of the end-bulb in an arborescent manner, there is a second very fine medullated fibre in the outer part of the core. ▼ Another modification was discovered by W. Krause in certain parts of the external generative organs, both in the male and female (especially in the glans penis and clitoridis), and may be named genital end-bulbs. These corpuscles are usually sub- divided by connective-tissue septa into from two to six knob-like portions, which gives the whole corpuscle a mulberry-like aspect. From one to four medullated fibres enter the genital corpuscle; their axis-cylinders for the most part break up within it into a large number of fine pale terminal fibres. Their size varies greatly, some of them being no larger than ordinary end-bulbs, others several times as large. In the simplest the axis-cylinder of the nerve-fibre entering at one pole of the somewhat oval corpuscle (fig. 416) may either pass straight or with one or two bendings through the corpuscle, and end by a tapering or by a dilated extremity near the opposite pole (often projecting beyond the general body of n Fig. 415.—Articular end-bulb FROM PHALANGE.\L .JOINT IN man.

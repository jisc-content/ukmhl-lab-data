217 NEURO-FIBRILS appear to be of universal occurrence. They can be coloured intra vitam by methylene-blue,* and are also specifically stained post mortem by various methods.'^ Fig. 334.—Neubo-fibeils in spinal ganglion-cells of embbyo. (Cajal.) A, B, unipolar cells ; C, D, F, G, transitional cells; E, E, cells which are still bipolar; H, a cell with the neuro-fibrils as yet imperfectly developed. The neuro-fibrils are traceable along the axis-cylinder of all nerves as far as their terminations; the ultimate ramifications of the axis-cylinder may end in what appear to be single fibrils. Some observers describe them as exhibiting junctions (anastomoses) through- out their course in the cell-body (figs. 333, 334, 335) and cell-processes.^ This is, however, denied by others, who believe that the neuro-fibrils run distinct from one another in the nerve- Fig. 335.—Neueo-fibbils in nebve-cell of annelid.

210 NERVE-CELLS term ‘ cyton ’ to denote the nueleated cell-body. If this is adopted the neurone or neurocyte would be described as composed of cyton, axon, and dendrons. The nerve-fibre process varies in length from a millimetre or less, as in some of the cells of the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, to more than a metre, as in the fibres of limb-nerves. It seems probable that in many cases the size of the cell- body bears a relationship to the length of the fibre which arises from it. The axon is always imbranched until it nears its termination ; except that it may give off fine Fig. 322.—a nebve-cell from the cerebral CORTEX, SHOWING A VARICOSE CONDITION OF THE DENDRITIC PROCESSES.

All these possess a medullary sheath, d, ending of a dendron. lateral offsets {collaterals) into the grey matter adjacent to the cell- body. In some nerve-cells the axon is the only process which the cell pos- sesses, but most nerve-cells have other processes which begin to branch im- mediately on leaving the cell-body, like the roots or branches of a tree; these processes are known as dendrons Fig. 323.—Nerve-cells of cerebral cortex SHOWING SPINES ON DENDRONS.

(Cajal.) a, apical dendron of two cells; b, aiiical dendron of another coll which is not included in the figure ; c, c, axons; d, e, terminations of dendrons. or dendrites—they always terminate in the neighbourhood of the cell-body. The dendrons resemble the protoplasm of the cell-body in structure, and were accord- ingly termed by Golgi the 'protoplasmic processes ^; the axon has a clearer, less 1 Golgi at first supposed that the dendrons serve exclusively for the purpose of obtaining nutriment for the nerve-cell, like the roots of a tree. Whether they have such a function or not it is nevertheless certain that they conduct nerve-impulses. It has been suggested that the nerve-cell is capable of

On reaching this it turns towards the medulla, being at first spiral (Schachowa), but after- wards quite straight; it now becomes much attenuated as it passes towards the papilla. In this form it is known as the first or descending fart of the looped tube of Henle. Near the papilla it loops round, still of small diameter ; but it soon enlarges sonie- Fig, 866.—Part of section of an in.iected kidney.

According to Huber, who adopts the usual view regarding tlie ascending and descending limbs, the loop in man is always formed bv the lareer tubule (see fig. 867). j & Q Q 2

THE CONNECTIVE TLS8UE8 110 expanded form of aponeuroses, as those of the broad muscles of the abdomen, which form strong fibrous layers in the walls of that cavity and add to their strength. It thus appears that fibrous tissue presents itself under two principal forms, the fascicular and the membranous. Fibrous tissue is white, with a shining, silvery, or pearly aspect. It is exceed- ingly strong and tough, yet perfectly pliant; but it is almost devoid of extensibility. By these qualities it is admirably suited to the purposes to which it is applied in the animal frame. By its inextensible character it maintains in apposition the parts which it connects against any severing force short of that sufficient to cause Fig. 178.â€”Section of tendon, human. (Sobotta.)

Accordingly the ligaments and tendons do not sensibly yield to extension in the strongest muscular efiorts ; and though they sometimes snap asunder, it is well known that bones will break more readily than tendons of equal thickness, and the fibrous membranes are proportionally strong and alike inextensible. In fibrous tissue the bundles of white filaments run parallel, cohering very intimately. They either run all in one direction as in ordinary tendons and liga- ments, or intersect each other in different planes as in some aponeuroses, or they

DEVELOPMENT 505 gets thinner and flatter, and, like the common dental lamina itself, becomes cribriform, so that in sections there appear to be breaches of its continuity. Its connexion, however, with the common dental germ, and through this with the buccal epithelium on the one hand and the germ of the corresponding tooth of the secondary dentition on the other hand, long persists. As Fig. 735.—Section of second milk-incisob of an embkyo 30 centimetbes long. The EPITHELIAL STBUCTUBES ONLY ABE BEPBESENTED. (From a model by C.

Magnified 100 diameters. l.d.l., labio-dental lamina, hero separated from and well in advance of the dental lamina; d.L, placed over the shallow dental furrow, points to the dental lamina, which is spread out below to form the enamel-germ of the future tooth; _2i., bicuspidate papilla, capped by the enamel-germ; d.s., condensed tissue forming dental sac ; e., mouth-epithelium. common dental lamina and the bands connecting the special dental germs with it thus become ultimately broken up into separate fragments or islands of dental epithelium of varying size and form. Such ‘ islands ’ are frequently seen in the infant near the surface of the gum, as pearl-like masses or nests, the so-called ‘ glands of Serres.’ Normally they have no functional

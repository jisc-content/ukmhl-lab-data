STRITCTUEE OF NERVE-CENTEES 314 In difierent regions of the cortex there is considerable variation in the size, form, and arrangement of the cells, the most striking differences being found in the motor cortex of the frontal lobe, and in the parts of the cortex concerned with reception of sensory impulses. The motor cortex (fig. 485) is characterised bv the Fig, 487.—Section of first temporal gyrus OF MAN. Nissl method. (Cajal.) 1, plexiform layer ; 2, small; 3, medium ; 4, large pyramids ; 5, granular layer ; 6, deep pyramids ; 7, fusiform and polymorphous cells.

They give origin to the fibres of the pyramid- tract and undergo Nissl degeneration when these fibres are severed. Most of the sensory and percipient parts of the cortex—parietal lobe (fig. 486), temporal lobe

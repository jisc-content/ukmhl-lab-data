. VARIETIES ^225 type I. of Golgi; those of which the axon-terminations are close to the cell-'bocly are known as cells of type II. of Golgi. But it cannot be doubted that every transition must exist between the extreme examples of these two types. Some of the largest multipolar nerve-cells are those of the nuclei of origin of the motor nerves, and these con- tain the largest and most distinct Nissl bodies. Very large cells are also found in certain parts of the cerebral cortex (motor region) and in the cerebellar cortex (cells of Pur- kinje, cells of Golgi). On the other hand, the presence of a large ^ 1 » Fig. 350. — A cell of Golgi’s type ii. with axon ending in number OI very small bamification neab the cell-body. Golgi method.

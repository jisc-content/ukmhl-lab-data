638 MALE URETHRA Cowper’s g'lands.—In the bulbous portion of the urethra, near its anterior end, are the paired openings of the ducts of Cowper^s or the hulho-urethral glands. These (fig. 929, c.G.) are situated above the bulb, behind the membranous portion of the urethra and between the two layers of the triangular ligament, the inferior layer supporting them against the urethra. The arteries of the bulb pass above, and the transverse fibres of the compressor urethrae beneath these glands. They form two Fig. 928.—Section through the opening op the duct of a gland op Littre of the MALE URETHRA. (Licliteiiberg.) Magnified 200 diameters. g, gland; m, its mouth; ?t, epithelium of urethra. The gland is similar in structure to Cowiier’s glands, but simpler in conformation. Its cells are mucus-secreting. small firm rounded masses, about the size of peas. They are compoimd racemose glands, composed of several small lobules held together by a firm investment. This latter, as w.ell as the walls of the ducts, contains muscular tissue. The epithelium of the acini consists of clear columnar cells, with a basal nucleus and reticular cytoplasni, staining like the cells of mucous glands. Secretion-capillaries penetrate between the cells. ‘ Crescents ’ and ‘ serous ’ cells appear to be absent. After secretion the gland-cells are found to be smaller and more cubical and to have

INCEPTION PHENOMENA 07 Intake of fluid material.—Although many amoeboid cells possess the power of taking in solid material in the manner just described, it must not be forgotten that the normal method of intake of nutrient material by the cells of both plants and animals is in the fluid form. In doing this, there is no doubt that the cell-protoplasm has the property of exercising a selection ; those materials of the Fig. 109.—A long pseudopodium of Lieberkuhnia upon which an infusorial animalculf- HAS BEEN CAUGHT. ThE ANIMALCULE IS SHOWN BEING GRADUALLY ENCOMPASSED AND EVENTUALLY DIGESTED BY THE PROTOPLASM OF THE PSEUDOPODIUM. (Vei’WOrn.) blood or lymph, or other liquid which bathes the cells, which are adapted for subserv- ing a useful purpose in each particular case, being alone imbibed. For many animal cells this may include all the materials of the blood-plasma ; for some, only certain substances. From these nutrient fluids the protoplasm builds up both its living substance and also non-protoplasmic products of its activity, and gives out again to the lymph unused or waste materials for which the cell has no further use.

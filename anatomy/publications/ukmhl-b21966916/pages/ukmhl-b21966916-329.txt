ENDINCtS in SENSE-ORaANS 293 somewhat conical ‘ foot ’ sometimes ramified), through all the retinal layers, as far as the rods and cones. Here the fibres of Muller end in a number of fine short fibrils which extend around and probably aid in supporting the inner segments of the rods and cones. At the level of the layer of inner granules each Mullerian fibre contains a nucleus. Modifications of the above described arrangements of the retinal elements are met with in the central area {macula lutea and fovea centralis) and in the anterior or peripheral part, at the pars ciliaris. In the central fovea (fig. 464) there are only cone-elements, rods being absent. These, however, begin to appear at the edges of the fovea, and soon become more numerous than the cones. The latter are much more slender in this part of the retina than elsewhere, and the fibres which come off from them run obliquely towards the bipolar layer, producing the appearance known as the fibrous layer of Henle. At the ora serrata the retinal layers cease abruptly, at least so far as concerns the nervous elements. In front of the ora serrata the place of the retina is taken by a double epithelial stratum termed the pars ciliaris retince, the cells of the inner layer of which are long and columnar, those of the outer layer shorter and pigmented. These two layers are continued over and between the ciliary processes and on to the back of the iris, but here both strata are formed of pigmented cells (see fig. 167, p. 101). An account of these modifications and full details regarding the structure of the retina and of the sense-organs generally will be found in the part of this work which deals with the sense-organs (Vol. III., Part 2).

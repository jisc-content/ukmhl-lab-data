118 THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES which is here termed intercellular substance, is itself a kind of exoplasm, and as much a living part of the cell-syncytium as the endoplasm, which is the term used by Mall to designate the cytoplasm of the branched cells. Mall holds that the fibres are developed in the exoplasm; and since he regards this as living material, the opinion which he expresses of the formation of fibres exhibits a certain resemblance to that which regards them as being produced from the cell- protoplasm. A view somewhat similar to that of Mall is taken by M. Heidenhain (see p. 2). In favour of the view of Waldeyer and Flemming is the fact that in young connective tissue there are to be seen long cells with fibrillated protoplasm which might be regarded as in process of conversion into bundles of white fibrils (fig. 192 Fig. 193.â€”Developing connective tissue feom the umbilical cord of a three months' HUMAN EMBRYO. (Minot.) X 511. /, fibres developing in intercellular substance. and fig. 171, /). And various authors have described an apparent continuity, both in young and in developed connective tissue, of the elastic fibres with the cells of the tissue, or even with their nuclei. In favour of the view which was advocated by Kolliker may be instanced the appearance of the jelly-like connective tissue of the early embryo in which fibres of both kinds can be seen coursing through the intercellular substance, apart from the cells (fig. 193). In the case of the elastic fibres, these, according to Ranvier, appear in the form of rows of granules or globules, which subsequently become fused together end to end, and are not at any time continuous with cells (fig. 194). To form an elastic membrane, in place of being arranged in lines the globules are deposited in small patches, and by their fusion the membrane is formed (p). In elastic cartilage granules first make Iheir appearance in the immediate neighbourhood of

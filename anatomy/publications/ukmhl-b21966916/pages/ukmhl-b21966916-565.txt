TONSILS 521 ■epithelium is more extensive in the embryo than after birth. Some of the gland- ducts of the lower part of the pharynx are said by Klein to retain their ciliated lining throughout life. Outside the mucous membrane the wall of the pharynx is composed of fibrous tissue, which is attached above to the base of the skull. In contact with the fibrous wall and partly inserted into it are the pharyngeal muscles (cross-striated) ; these are described elsewhere in this work (Myology). The tonsils are composed of masses of lymphoid tissue arranged around crypt- like depressions in the mucous membrane (fig. 756). These crypts open at the surface of the tonsil and there discharge the secretion of mucous glands which open into the crypts. The mucus carries with it a large number of leucocytes which have passed into the crypts from the lymphoid tissue : for, as originally shown by Stohr, the cells of this tissue penetrate in large numbers between the cells of the stratified epithelium of the tonsils, and become free at the surface. Occasionally this process is accompanied, even in health, but much more in the inflamed Fig. 757.—Pakt of a section of rabbit’s tonsil sho-\ving infiltration of the EPITHELIUM BY LEUCOCYTES.

The lymphoid tissue shows many ‘ germ-centres,’ the nodular character of the tissue being in this way produced by local multiplication of the lymphocytes. The lymphoid tissue of the tonsils and of the pharynx generally is richly provided with blood-vessels. There are also many lymphatics in its deeper layers. • ^ On the blood-vessels of the lymphoid tissue of the pharynx and fauces see Alagna, Anat. Anz. xxxii. 1908.

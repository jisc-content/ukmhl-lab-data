CENTROSOME B1 Occasionally the centrosonie assumes an irregular form and is of considerably larger size than usual.' The centrosome is connected, as we have seen, with fibrillar formations (asters, spindles) within the protoplasm. In columnar epithelium-cells (figs. 55, 56) the (double) centriole lies near Fig. 55, — Columnar epithelium-cells from DUCK-EMBRYO EACH CONTAINING A DIPLOSOME NEAR THE FREE BORDER. (M. Heidenliain.) Fig. 56. — Centrosomes IN EPITHELIUM-CELLS OF ILEUM OF MAN. (Gurvvitsch, after Zim- mermann.) Two cells are seen : one, a columnar cell, has a double centrosome near the free border ; the other, a goblet-cell, shows a single centrosome amongst the mucin granules. the free surface ; in goblet-cells it is in the middle of the mucin-containing part (fig. 56), and from one side a fine filament may project towards the free surface, while from the other side another Fig. 58.—A cell of testicle (sperma- tid), SHOWING THE TAIL FILAMENT OF SPERMATOZOON GROWING OUT FROM THE DOUBLE CENTRIOLE.

The centriole is in close relationship with the development of the tail-fibril in spermatozoa (fig. 58) and with a very fine 1 For variations in this body, cf. M. Heidenliain, Plasma u. Zelle, 1907. In the spermatogonia of the salamander the centrosomes are large and well-marked and remain connected together in adjacent cells for some time after completion of cell-division (F. Meves, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xliv. 1895 ; B. Rawitz, ibid.).

589 PLEURA but they become more flattened when the lung is distended (Klein). Lymphatic vessels are abundant in and beneath the pleura as in other serous membranes; they communicate in many parts, by means of stomata, with the cavity of the membrane. In the 'pleura costalis the stomata are only found over the intercostal spaces, not over the ribs (Dybkowsky) ; lymph-vessels are also more numerous over the spaces. Beneath the serous covering of the lung is a thin layer of subserous areolar tissue mixed with a large number of elastic fibres. It is continuous with the areolar tissue in the interior of the lung, and has been described as a distinct coat under the name of the second or deeper layer of the pleura. In the lungs of some animals, such as the lion, seal, and leopard, this subserous layer forms a very strong mem- brane, composed principally of elastic tissue ; in others, as the guinea-pig, a network of plain muscular fibres is found within it, the fibres tending to radiate from the apex (Klein). A close plexus of lymph-vessels is also met with in this sub-pleural tissue of the lung. The vessels communicate on the one side by means of stomata with the pleural cavity, and on the other with similar vessels in the inter- alveolar septa. Various authorities have described lymphoid nodules and even minute lymph-glands in or beneath the visceral pleura. A uniform network of venous capillaries covers the surface of the lung underneath the pleura. The network is supplied vith blood from the venules of the superficial pulmonary lobules, but also receives blood from the bronchial arteries (see p. 587). Its vessels are less closely arranged than the blood-vessels of the pulmonary alveoli, and are thus, as well as by their position, easily distinguishable from them in specimens of injected lung. The nerves of the pleura visceralis are derived, like those of the lung itself, through the pulmonary plexuses, from the vagus and sympathetic : the latter have ganglion-cells on their course. Those of the pleura parietalis come from various sources, but mostly from the intercostal nerves. Fig. 856.—Section of pleuba; ox. (Favaro.)

STRUCTUKE OE NERVE-CENTRES 298 bone by areolar tissue containing a venous plexus, as well as some loose fat. There are openings in the dura for the nerve-roots, which receive a sheath from it. The dura mater and arachnoid are attached to the pia mater by the denticulations of the longitudinal membrane o, dorsal root-fibres; h. fibres of Flechsig’s tract, passing from cells of Clarke’s column to cerebellum by inferior peduncle, h'; c, fibres of Gowers’ tract, passing from cells of Clarke’s column, partly to cerebellum, d, partly to corpora quadrigemina, e, and partly to thalamus,/; (j, fibres continued from cells of thalamus to cortex centri. known as the ligamentum denticulatum, which runs down the cord on each side. All the membranes contain elastic fibres, and their surfaces are covered with endothelium-like cells, similar to those of serous membranes.

17 FIBRILS IN PROTOPLASM regarded as due to a fibrillation of the protoplasm, which, being present and visible in the fresh and unaltered cell, is a true structural (and functional) Fig. 22.—Fibbils within nerve-cells.

We see from these instances that every phase of fibrillation may present itself within cell-protoplasm—from the transitory lineations which occur during the division of an otherwise undifferentiated cell to the distinct fixed fibrillations which are met with in the protoplasm of highly specialised cells. These differen- Fig. 24.—S.MALL PORTION OF A MUSCLE- FIBRE OF CRAB SPLITTING UP INTO FIBRILS. (Schiifei’.) From a photograph. Magnified GOO diameters.

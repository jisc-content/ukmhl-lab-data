SMALL INTESTINE 544 darkly stained streaks may be seen (in osmic preparations) extending from the inter-epithelial spaces to the borders of the central lacteal. It was denied by R. Heidenhain that the leucocytes of the intestine contain fatty particles during fat-absorption ; he stated that the particles within them which are stained black by Fig. 791.—Pabt of a tbansverse section of a villus of guinea-pig. (R. Heidenhain.) a, columnar epithelium, with goblet-cells between the ordinary cells; h, basement- membrane ; c section of a capillary blood-vessel; d, a phagocytic leucocyte; e, a group of plain muscle-cells, cut across; /, central lacteal. osmic acid are not fatty, but albuminous, being insoluble in ether. This is not, however, strictly correct. Many of the particles which the lymph-cells contain during fat-absorption unquestion- ably dissolve in ether and other solvents of fat, although some particles remain undissolved by those reagents. These particles may be of an albuminous nature, or they may still be fatty, Fig. 792.—Two stages in the deposition of fat in the intestinal epithelium of the FBOG. (Krehl.) but so modified by the action of the osmic acid as to have been rendered relatively insoluble in ether. In the frog, where absorption proceeds more slowly, and can be more easily traced, no fat is to be seen anywhere but in the epithelium-cells, in the leucocytes, and in the lacteals (fig. 793). In the guinea-pig also, as Heidenhain himself showed, there are many phago- cytic leucocytes (fig. 791, d), which take up the whole of the absorbed fat after it has traversed

59() KIDNEY condition it again reaches the medullary ray ; but it presently leaves this as a curiously irregular tubule (zigzag tubule) which takes a course towards the original Fig. 868.—Malpighian corpuscle from the rabbit’s kidney : nitrate of silver pre- paration. (Ludwig.) Highly magnified. V, vas afferens, showing its endothelial lining ; at v\ the transverse muscular fibres are also seen ; e, vas efferens ; a, a', basement-membrane of capsule with its lining epithelium passing at h into that of the commencing uriniferous tubule. Malpighian corpuscle from which the first convoluted tube emerged.^ After two or three contortions, which form the second or distal con- voluted tubule,'^ it once more becomes narrowed into the so-called junctional Pig. 867.—Plan of the course of the uriniferous tubules. (Huber.) This plan, which is based upon reconstructed models of the tubules, exhibits the relation of the convoluted tubules to the Malpighian corpuscles. Mf Malpighian corpuscles; •«, point of entrance of vessels of glomerulus; n, neck; d.c., distal con- voluted tubule, which arises from the Malpighian corpuscle ; s, spiral tubule into which it is continued; narrow descending limb of loop of Henle; H, loop of Henle (this is sometimes formed by the narrow part of the looped tubule, but is here represented as formed by the wider part); n, wider ascending limb of loop of Henle ; this passes back to the neighbourhood of the same Malpighian corpuscle, often becoming irregular and zigzag at its ui^per end. Here it becomes continuous with the proximal convoluted tubule, 71.c., which eventually passes into the junctional tubule, by which it is connected wdth a collecting tubule, c. B, duct of Bellini, receiving a number of conjoined collecting tubules and opening at a papilla. ’ Golgi, Rendi d. acc. d. Lincei, v. 1889. ' The second convoluted tubule was termed by Schweigger-Seidel ‘ Schaltstiick.’ This term also includes the zigzag tubule and the junctional tubule.

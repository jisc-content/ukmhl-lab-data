STRUCTUEE OE CELL 22 The granules of cell-protoplasm.—Attention has already been drawn to the fact that granules or globules (apparently composed of protein) are frequent, and in most cells constant, constituents of the protoplasm of cells. This has been long A recognised in the cells of secreting glands (figs. 32, 33), where their presence was demonstrated by Langley,' who showed that they are here closely related to the elaboration of the secretion, and especially of the enzymes and organic materials Fig. 32.—Submaxillaky gland of rabbit. (E. Miiller.) The cells are in different functional states, as indicated by the condition and staining of the granules, a, cell filled with darkly staining granules; b, clear cell, the granules being swollen and having a reticulum of protoplasm between them ; c, secretory canaliculi penetrating into the cells.

Fig. 34.—Granules in developing ovum OF RABBIT. (Winiwarter.) Granules occur, however, in cells such as leucocytes and developing ova ^ (fig. 34), which, so far as is known, are not concerned in the preparation of secretion, although, in view of recent researches which point to the fact that the occurrence of enzymes of some kind is well-nigh universal in all cells, it is less easy to draw a distinction between secretory and other cells than seemed previously possible. And while in some cells special methods of fixing and staining are required to show the granules,^ in others they are visible in the fresh condition or may be stained and observed intra vitam (fig. 35).

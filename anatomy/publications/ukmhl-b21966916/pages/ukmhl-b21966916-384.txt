348 BLOOD-VESSELS In vessels of 0*3 mm. in diameter, the elastic layers of the inner coat may be discovered (fig. 534, a, 8), in the form of fenestrated membranes or of longitudinal reticulating elastic fibres. At first all the membranes are of the nature of elastic fibres running longitu- dinally ; later these fibres increase in thickness (see fig. 535). During the next stage more elastin is deposited in the same plane as delicate fibres between those already present; and this process is continued till there results a membrane Fig. 533.—A small aktery, A, and vein, V, from the subcutaneous connectr’e tissue OF THE RAT.

There are, however, always apertures through which a free communication between the inner and outer divisions of a vessel is established. In the case of the kidney a close meshwork of fibres is deposited from the very first. These, with the increasing age and increasing diameter of the vessel, gradually become broadened out until a very even membrane with oval apertures results, as shown in the interlobular artery represented in fig. 525.

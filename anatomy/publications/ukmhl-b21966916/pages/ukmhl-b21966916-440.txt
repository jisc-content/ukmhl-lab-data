400 LYMPH-GLANDS contain a considerable number of pigment-granules, especially in the medulla of the gland (fig. 594). These reticulum-cells are phagocytic,^ and have been noticed to contain, besides pigment, erythrocytes in stages of disintegration; but it is Fig. 697.—Lymphoid tissue from medulla of lymph-gland of dog. (Schafer.) The trabeculae and the fibres of the reticular tissue are stained dark, the lymphocytes are only faintly stained. doubtful if this is a normal condition, for since there are no blood-vessels in the sinus, blood-corpuscles which may have passed into it must have got by accident into the lymph.

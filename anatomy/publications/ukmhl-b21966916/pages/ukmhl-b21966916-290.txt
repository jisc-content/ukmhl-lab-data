(Ranviev.) Highly magnified. li, sheath of the nerve-fibve; h, bifurcation of the fibre; e, node ; m, short segment beyond the node; r, terminal ramifications of the axis- cylinder ; n, nuclei on the branches of the axis- cylinder ; n\ nuclei in the granular substance of the end-plate. The granular substance lies in the intervals between the bi’auches of the axis-cylinder ; it is not seen in this figure. Fig. 396.—Cross-section of mus- cular FIBRE AND END-ORGAN OF LIZARD.

The termination of the axis-cylinder is, as just explained, not a continuous plate, as was thought by Rouget, but appears when viewed from the surface in the form of an arborescent figure (figs. 394 to 397), the branches of

230 NERVE-FIBRES be in transverse bands with clearer intervals between them (fig. 358). This appearance, which is probably due to successive precipitations of silver chloride within the semi-fluid substance of the axis-cylinder, was first described by Frommann, and is known as Frommann’s strim.^ Fig. 358.—Nerves stained with nitrate of silver. (Ranvier.) Small black crosses are seen upon the nerve-fibres at the nodes. In C it is evident that these are produced by staining of the axis-cylinders, cy, and of the constricting band, a. A shows markings due to a layer of epithelioid cells which covers the surface of the small nerve- bundle. In C, m denotes the medullary sheath. Fig. 359.—Diagram to show THE PARTS OF A MEDUL- LATED FIBRE. (Sliai'pey.) 1, 1, neurolemma enclosing the doubly contoured medul- lary sheath. 2, a i)art where the white substance is inter- rupted, the outer sheath re- maining. 3, axis - cylinder projecting beyond the broken end. 4, part of the substance of the medullary sheath escaped. Fig. 360.—Photograph of part of a section of the sciatic NERVE OF A CAT. Osiuic preparation. (Schiifer.) Magnified 300 diameters. The medullary sheaths are black; the axis-cylinders appear colourless. Notice the variation in size of the fibres. * For a possible explanation of the mode of formation of Frommann’s stria?, see Macdonald, Proc. Roy. Soc. B. Ixxvi. 1905, and Ixxix. 1907; also Quart.

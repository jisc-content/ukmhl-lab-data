ORIGIN OF LYMPHATICS 357 single vessel which begins with a blind or closed extremity at the free end of the villus, whence it passes to join the general plexus of the intestinal mucous membrane. In the more solid organs, such as glands, the lymph-vessels are found in the inter- stitial connective tissue. In many cases they lose in great measure the character of distinct tubular canals, and appear simply as cleft-like spaces ; these are, however, always bounded by an endothelial layer, like that which lines the lymph-vessels elsewhere. This lacunar formation of lymphatics was first described in the testicle by Ludwig and Tomsa, and it is now known to be characteristic of most glandular Fig. 547.—Lymphatics of centbal tendon op diapheagm of babbit, pleubal side : TBEATED WITH NITBATE OP SILVEB AFTEB EEMOVAL OP SUPEBFICIAL ENDOTHELIAL LAYEB.

Recklinghausen mistook for empty spaces; iZ, iZ, lymphatic vessels, which appear to be in continuity with the ‘ cell-spaces ’ at h, b. structures. Occupying everywhere the interstices of the penetrating connective tissue, the lymph bathes the exterior of the tubules or alveoli of the gland, in many parts even separating them from the capillary blood-vessels, so that the exchanges of material between the plasma of the blood and the secreting cells of the gland must be carried on through the intermedium of the lymph in these spaces. Lymphatics, although developed originally from veins, are in open communica- tion with the serous cavities, by means of orifices or stomata, which will be described with the serous membranes. These stomata allow of the passage of lymph from the serous cavities into the lymphatics. Owing to this the fluid which moistens them does not accumulate in the serous cavities under normal conditions. The

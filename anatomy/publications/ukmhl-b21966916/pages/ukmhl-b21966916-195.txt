Except on the side which is turned towards the advancing ossification of the shaft, the cartilage-cells do not become arranged in long columns in the manner described for the ossification of the shaft. The developing bone of the epiphysis, which is purely endochondral and owes none of its substance directly to subperiosteal ossification, is marked off fairly sharply from the adjacent cartilage (figs. 255, 256). Apophyses are formed from distinct osseous centres similar to those which form the epiphyses (fig. 256, A) ; FORMATION OF EPIPHYSES 167 Formation of epiphyses.—Blood-vessels extend from the newly formed osseous tissue of the shaft beyond it into the cartilage where the epiphysis is to appear. The vessels are lodged in excavations or branching canals in the cartilage (fig. 218, hv ; fig. 255, co), which also contain osteoblasts. Other nutrient canals enter the cartilage, and conduct vessels into it either directly from the perichon- drium or from the ossifying shaft, but these are not concerned with its ossification.' The formation of osseous tissue begins in the extremities of the bone from one or more independent centres, and extends from those points through the epiphysial

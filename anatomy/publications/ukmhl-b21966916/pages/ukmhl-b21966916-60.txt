40 STRUCTUKE OF CELL certain cells, when studied in this way, show stages of constriction leading up to complete division of the nuclei without, in any of the cells observed, presenting the appearances which are characteristic of karyokinetic cell-division, the cells in n V \ f Fig. 7-1.—Cell of bladdeb epithelium, showing amitotic division op nucleus.

Amitotic division is said to be characteristic of the superficial cells of the urinarv bladder^ (see fig. 74), and of the Fig. 75.—A polymobph leucocyte of Tkiton fixed by a jet of steam during what appears TO BE AMITOTIC DIVISION.

The process has been followed in them under the microscope by E. Klein. ’ Flemming, Arch. f. mikr. Anat. xxxiv. 1889. ^ For instances of amitotic division, chiefly in invertebrata, see C. M.

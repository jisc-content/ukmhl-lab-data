502 TEETH lamina, whilst the other, lingual or inner jmrt, takes first a vertical and then an inward (lingual) direction, and is the actual tract of cells in connexion with which the teeth of both dentitions subsequently become developed. The name dental lamina, or common dental germ,^ should therefore be retained for this portion of the original strand of ectoderm-cells. The separation of the two strands begins in front and extends gradually backwards : it is not complete until Fig. 782.—Figukes (fkom Rose’s models) showing four successive stages in the DEVELOPMENT OF THE DENTAL LAMINA AND TOOTH-GERMS OF THE MILK-TEETH OF THE UPPER JAW. Only the buccal epithelium and the epithelial structures of the tooth-germs are represented, and everything is shown as seen from above, i.e. from the attached surface. 1. From an embryo 25 mm. long.—d.l., dental lamina; M., aperture of mouth. 2. From an embryo -10 mm. long.—M., mouth ; ?./., reverse of labio-dental furrow ; d.l., dental lamina; mould for papilla of milk-canine; mould for papilla of second milk-molar. 3. From an embryo 115 ram. long.—L., epithelial layer of upi)er lip ; /./., reverse of labio- dental furrow; d.L, dental lamina; epithelial rudiment of first milk-incisor; m.c., ni.vt.\ m.mr, epithelial rudiments of second milk-incisor and of milk canine, and first and second molars respectively. 4. From an embryo 180 mm. long.—m.i.^, m.i.-, m.c., m.m.'^, m.m.-, as before; of first permanent molar. ^ ‘Dental germ ’ should be used instead of the more common expression ‘enamel-germ,’ because the cells in (luestion not o)ily form enamel, but also determine the extent of the formation of dentine by the adjacent mesoderm-cells (see p. 511).

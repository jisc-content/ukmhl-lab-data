KIDNEY 594 The number of Malpighian corpuscles in the kidney is very large. It was estimated by Huecke at about two millions for the human kidney, but this number is probably too high. Schweigger-Seidel reckoned that in the pig’s kidney there are about half a million. Miller and Carlton found in actual counts from the kidney of the cat, cut into serial sections, about 16,000 for each kidney. a, part of arterial arch; 6, interlobular artery ; c, glomerulus; d, efferent vessel passing to medulla as false arteria recta; e, capillaries of cortex; /, capil- laries of medulla; g, venous arch ; h, straight veins of medulla; i, interlobular vein ; j, vena stellula. We have already traced the course of the tubules from their openings into the dilated termination of the ureter backwards to the Malpighian corpuscles, but before considering their structure it will be useful to follow their course in the other direction, which is that taken by the urine they secrete (fig. 867.)

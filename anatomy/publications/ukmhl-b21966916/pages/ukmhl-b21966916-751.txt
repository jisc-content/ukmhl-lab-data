687 PARAGANGLIA the abdominal aorta. So far as is known, all are associated in development with the cells which form the blastema of the sympathetic ganglia, and arc probably related in function to the suprarenal capsules. * Fig. 991.—Section op an irregular nodule of the coccygeal gland. (Sertoli.) Magnified 85 diameters. The section shows the fibrous covering of the nodule, the blood-vessels within it, and the epithelial cells of which it is constituted. Fig. 992.—Section op coccygeal gland. (Walker.) 1, blood-spaces ; 2, gland-epithelium ; 3, connective tissue. The carotid grlands are placed one on each side at the bifurcation of the common carotid (fig. 988). Each consists of a mass of fibrous tissue in which are imbedded small nodules of epithelium-hke cells (fig. 989), some of which may show ^ The paraganglia which contain cells similar to those of the medulla of the suprarenal capsules are termed by Swale Vincent ‘chromaphil bodies.’

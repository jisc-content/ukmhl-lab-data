74 VITAL PHENOMENA OF PROTOPLASM animalcule crawls over surfaces as if with pseudopodia instead of swimming about as in nearly all other free ciliated forms. Such cases seem to present transitions between cilia and pseudo- Fig. 116.—Artodiscus saltans. (Gurwitsch, after Penard.) 1. The complete animalcule. 2. Base of a pseudopodium, highly magnified. The pseudopodium is seen to be a hollow extension of the protoplasm provided with a bulb-like enlargement at the base. These pseudopodia exhibit rhythmic pendulum-like movements. Fig. 117. — Camptonema nutans, an ANIMALCULE ALLIED TO THE Heliozoa. (Gurwitsch, after Schau- dinn.) The long tapered pseudopodia are provided each one with a hollow axial filament formed of a soft semi-fluid material, which is covered by an exten- sion of the general protoplasm. The pseudopodia are capable of being ex- tended and retracted, and some of them are shown in the act of seizing a minute alga. They also exhibit cilium-like movements, bending over from the base of the pseudopodium.

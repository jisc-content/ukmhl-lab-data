519 DEVELOPMENT stratified epithelium of the mouth. These buds are at first solid, and exhibit an expanded or bulbous growing extremity, which, by its extensions and ramifications, eventually forms all Fig. 754.—From a section of human sublingual, (v. Ebner.) Magnified 500 diameters. d, lobular ductule dividing below into two branches ; a, a, a, alveoli lined by mucus-secreting cells—one of them shows a crescentic mass of serous cells at its periphery; a', an alveolus, from the cells of which the mucus has been discharged; m, a mucus-secreting cell amongst the ordinary epithelium-cells of the ductule. Fig. 755.—Section of submaxillary {A) and retrolingual {B) of cat. (Illing.) The glands are in close juxtaposition and the section passes through the junction. ft, mucous cells; h, their nuclei; c, serous cells ; d, their nuclei; e, serous cells forming a complete ring encircling the mucous cellsalveoli cut near periphery, showing the serous cells only ; g, lumen of alveolus ; //, interstitial connective tissue ; i, section of a salivary duct; k, section of a larger duct. the ducts and alveoli of the gland. A cavity soon forms within the at first solid excrescence, and this becomes connected with the cavity of the mouth on the one side, and on the other

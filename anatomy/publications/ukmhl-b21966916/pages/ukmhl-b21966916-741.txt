679 THYMUS with one another, like epithelium-cells. Lymphocytes are much less numerous in the medulla than in the cortex. In some animals isolated portions of striated muscle are developed in the medulla ‘ (fig. 978) andl occasionally vesicles lined by ciliated cells occur (fig. 976, c ; fig. 978). The presence of giant-ceUs like those in bone-marrow has also been noted (fig. 979).^ These are all said to be formed from reticulum-cells (Hammar). The concentric corpuscles are also derived from the original epithelial tube which forms the basis of the developing thymus (see Vol. I., Pt. I., pp. 169 to 172). According to some authorities^ the lymphoid cells are also of epithelial {i.c. entodermic) origin, and are not derived, as has usually been believed, from the surrounding mesodermic tissue. But this is not corroborated by the researches of Hammar, who finds that the first lymphocytes are brought to the developing gland, and are not originally formed there. Besides lymphocytes, the lobules contain a certain number of granular oxyphil leucocytes and polymorph leucocytes. Fig. 980.—Okigin of thymus and thyeoid fkom the viscebal POUCHES OF THE EMBRYO.

Small portions of thymus tissue are constantly found in association with the thyroid and parathyroids (Kohn). These may consist of both cortical tissue and medulla, and exhibit concentric corpuscles. They are developed from the fourth branchial cleft. Nucleated red blood-corpuscles (erythroblasts) like those met with in bone-marrow may occur in the thymus (Schaffer). The retrogressive development of the thymus gland is accompanied by an increase in the interstitial connective tissue, which also invades the lobules. In this ^ Pensa, Boll. Soc. Med. Chir. d.

Anat. v. 1906), who studied the development in the pig-embryo, also concludes that the lymphocytes are of epithelial origin. He finds that the Hassall corpuscles develop from parts of the syncytium of branching entoderm cells which form the reticulum. At an early stage colloidal matter may be found in the cells of the Hassall corpuscles. ^ Hammar, Anat. Anz. xxvii. 1905 ; Arch. f. Anat. xxix. 1907. See also T. H. Bryce, Journ.

THE SMALLER BLOOD-VESSELS 349 In tlie transverse section of the small artery represented in fig. 536, the elastic lamina has become corrugated owing to post-mortem contraction of the middle coat.

The small veins differ from arteries of corresponding size, chiefly in the inferior development of their muscular tissue ; the lining cells of the arteries also are very Fig. 53G,—Transverse section of a small artery (on the left) and of a small vein (on the right). Magnified 250 diameters. (Schiifer.) much longer and narrower than those of the veins. These differences, as well as the comparative size of corresponding vessels, are well shown in the accompanying figures (figs. 533, 534, 536).

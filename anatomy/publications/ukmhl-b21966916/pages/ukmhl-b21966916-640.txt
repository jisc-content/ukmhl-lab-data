582 LUNGS no longer appear as imperfect rings running only upon the front and lateral surfaces of the air-tube, but are disposed over all sides of the tubes in the form of irregularly shaped plates and incomplete rings of various sizes (fig. 845). These are most a b f d Fig. 848.—Section of mucous membrane and muscular coat op a bronchial TUBE. (Schafer.)

They may be traced, becoming rarer and rarer and more reduced in size, as far as bronchia one milhmetre in diameter, Fig. 849.—Section of a small bronchial tube (4 mm. in diameter) prom the pig’s lung.

Tlie folding of the mucous membrane is probably the result of strong post-mortem contraction of the muscular layer. after which they disappear. The general sheet of connective tissue extends to the smallest tubes, becoming^thinner by degrees, and degenerating into areolar tissue. In it are mucous and muco-serous glands which send their ducts to open on

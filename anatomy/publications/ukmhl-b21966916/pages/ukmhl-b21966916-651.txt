MALPIGHIAN CORPUSCLES 593 stated that some of the arterise rectse come direct from the arches, and this view has generally been followed.^ The efferent vessels are slightly smaller than the afferent; the two are united within the glomerulus by a convoluted mass of branching capillaries {rete mirabile), which is, as already noted, itself lobulated. The capillaries of the glomeruli do not show the usual differentiation into endothelium-cells on treatment with silver nitrate (Drasch). The glomerulus is contained within a terminal dilatation of each uriniferous tubule (Bowman). The basement-membrane, which invests the whole tubule, forms the external gi m.r.

The glomerulus pro- jects freely into the dilatation, covered only by a reflexion of the capsule and of the flattened epithelium which lines it (fig. 865, in foetus). Both this covering epithelium and the basement-membrane which invests the glomerulus and dips in between its lobes, are, in the adult, much thinner and more delicate than the corresponding structures which form the external wall of the dilatation. The whole structure, including the dilated termination of the tubule and the glomerulus which it encloses, is known as a Malpighian corpuscle.

Golubew states that they are also given off from the afferent vessels to some of the most deeply lying glomeruli. VOL. II. PART I. Q Q

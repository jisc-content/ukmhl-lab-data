620 TESTICLE mitotic division, the s'permatocyies ; and 3, a large number of small cells with resting nuclei, the spermatids.'^ These last are ready for transformation into spermatozoa c Fig. 902.—Portions of two tubules from the rat corresponding to the tubules h AND C OF FIG. 901, BUT MORE HIGHLY MAGNIFIED. (F. H, A. Marshall.) a, basement-membrane; b, spermatogonium; c, spermatocyte; d, spermatozoa within lumen of tube; e, interstitial cells. Fig. 903.—Transformation of a spermatid into a spermatozoon : mouse. (Benda.) a, spermatid with a filament extending from its centrosome beyond the cytoplasm. The archoplasm lies on one side of the nucleus; b, extension of the filament; the archoplasm is now at the opposite pole of the nucleus; c, elongation of the cell and passage of the nucleus towards the end opposite the “ tail ” filament to form the head of the future spermatozoon ; d to h, transformation of nucleus into head of spermatozoon, and formation of middle piece from part of cytoplasm. The spiral fibre of the middle piece is produced from the mitochondria of the cytoplasm. ^ ‘ Young spermatozoa ’ of H. H. Brown (Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci. xxv. 1885), who was the first to give a clear description of the changes which occur in the seminal epithelium in the production of spermatozoa.

They are characterised mainly by the tendency which the branches of the axis-cylinder have to end in flattened expansions, often concatenated and lying, as in other end-bulbs, in a core. Each has a connective- tissue capsule, composed of several lamellEe like those of the Pacinian corpuscle (fig. 419).

These corpuscles have also been described by A. S. Dogiel ^ in other parts of the skin. They appear to be intermediate in complexity between the end-bulbs of Krause and the corpuscles of Pacini. Corpuscles of Pacini.—In dissecting the nerves of the hand and foot certain small oval bodies like little seeds may be found attached to their finer branches as they pass through the subcutaneous fat on their way to the skin ; Fig. 419.—A Golgi-Mazzoni end-oegan feom the sueface of a tendon.

The corpuscles referred to were described and figured by Vater in 1741, as attached to the digital nerves, but he did not examine into their structure, and his account of them seems not to have attracted much notice. In more recent times, their existence was again pointed out by Cruveilhier and other French anatomists, as well as by Pacini of Pisa, who appears to have been the first writer to give an account

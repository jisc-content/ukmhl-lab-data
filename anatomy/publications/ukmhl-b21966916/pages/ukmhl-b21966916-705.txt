GKAAFIAN FOLLICLES G45 are formed. Kemains of the egg-tubes are sometimes seen in the ovaries of adult animals (fig. 938, h). Imbedded in all parts of the stroma except near the hilum are a large number of spherical or ovoid vesicles, each containing an ovum together with a number of other cells. These vesicles are the Gmajian follicles : they are found of all sizes from a diameter little larger than the contained ovum and entirely microscopic (fig. 939), to a rounded sac as large as a pea, often forming a pellucid projection at the surface of the ovary. The smallest Graafian follicles contain only a small immature ovum and a single layer of epithelium- cells surrounding it; the largest contain an ovum of mature size (about 0’2 mm.) Membrana granulosa of a' large follicle. WrJ ** Fig. 936.—Section of part of the ovary of a young girl. (v. Buhm and Davidoff.) Magnified 190 diameters. surrounded by a considerable mass of follicular epithelium-cells {discus 'proligerus or cumulus), by which it is attached to the wall of the follicle, while layers of the same cells line the follicular wall {theca) and form the so-called memhrana granulosa. These larger follicles (fig. 940) are distended by fluid {liquor folliculi), and as this fluid accumulates they come to occupy a considerable cavity in the stroma, eventually, as we have seen, even projecting from its surface. It is at the projecting part that the follicle ultimately bursts, liberating the ovum surrounded by its discus proligerus; but the epithelium which lines the follicle remains in situ and undergoes prolifera- tion, becoming developed into the epithelial tissue of a corpus luteum.

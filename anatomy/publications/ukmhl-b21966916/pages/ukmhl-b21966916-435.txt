395 COEPUSCLES OF LYMPH AND CHYLE produced in situ within the lymphoid tissue underlying the epithelium through which they penetrate. The case of the villi of the intestine is perhaps different. In these, especially during digestion, great numbers of leucocytes are found, both between the epithelium-cells and also between those cells and the basement-membrane, as well as in the interstices of the reticular tissue, and even within the commencing lymph-vessel (lacteal) of the villus.â€™ These leucocytes must mainly be derived from the blood circulating through the villus, for there is no evidence of their multiplication by division within the tissue of the villus.^ Although they have not been observed, as with the leucocytes of the tonsils, to pass out on the free surface of the mucous membrane, there is reason to believe that during food-absorption they pass from the tissue of the villus into the com- mencing lacteals, and there undergo disintegration. It may also be the case that others become disintegrated outside the lacteals, although the occurrence of such disintegration in this situation would be difficult of detection. ^ Schiifer, Proc. Roy. Soc. xxxviii. 1885 ; and Int. Monthly Journ. Anat. and Physiol. 1885. 2 In the papers just referred to, it was assumed that the leucocytes within the villi might multiply division, But it appears on the whole more probable that they are brought to the villi by the blood-vessels.

1() On the Lohus Olfactorius Impar. its recess, which can be readily recognised, even in the adult. Thus in the adult human brain the recess found dorsal to the anterior commissure between the two anterior pillars of the fornix, and in front of the ending of the median choroid plexus, and united fornix pillars, called recessus triangularis by Schwalbe, he considered to be the homo- logue of the recessus olfactorius impar. He also found the recess in the brains of other adult mammals. Von Wijhe’s px’evious observations on the embryos of bhds agreed with those of von Kuplfer in respect to the last point of connection between the brain-tube and ecto- derm being always found between the lateral olfactory ectodermal plates, although he did not describe a median olfactory plate. This plate has, however, been noted by Miss Platt in Acanthias. Kabl. Riickhard (2) also describes the recess and lobe in Selachians, and notes them as being present in Amphibia and Reptiles. The views of His (3) are very different to those of von Kupffer. He recognises that von Kupffer has shown that the last part of the wall of the primitive ventricular cavity to lose its connection with the ectoderm is situated at the junction of its roof and anterior boundary, and that this has the form of a conical projection which remains for some time connected vdth the ectoderm by a cord. This projection is, however, considered by His as forming the dorsal sac of the lamina terminalis, and as having nothing to do with the olfactory function; he, therefore, calls it the augulus terminalis. The olfactory lobes develop laterally from the lamina terminalis, and Kupffer founds his theory on the supposi- tion that in the Cyclostoma, or Round-mouthed Animals, the neuropore runs to an unpaired olfactory organ. His claims to have shown that in these also the olfactory organ

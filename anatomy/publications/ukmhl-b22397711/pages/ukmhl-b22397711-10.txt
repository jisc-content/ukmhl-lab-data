The Position of Anatomy. 6 both as regards external form and serial microscopic sec- tions, a very complete series of specimens at intervals of four hours from the eighteenth hour after union of the sexes up to bh*th, which occurs at the end of the third week. In the human example I have also been able, by the kindness of many friends in Dublin and in various parts of Ireland and England, to make and work over an almost complete series of specimens, varying in length from less than 10 mm. up to birth. In addition, I have photographed complete series of sections made in the sagittal, coronal, and horizontal direc- tions of the adult brains of the cat, dog, seal, rabbit, monkey, and man, in the last, also at birth, and at several intervening stages. I had made 150 slides for the screen, selecting examples from all those stated in the preceding summary of my work; time, however, prevented me from showing more than one hundred. The Plates which accompany this summary I have had made in order to give readers an idea of those which were thrown on the screen. As the number had to be limited I selected negatives for reproduction which dealt with the anatomy of human foetuses (Plates IV. and V.), or with that of the human embryo and lower mammal (Plate I.). Plates II. and III. were selected to show the aid which photogi*aphy can give in the easy reading of serial sections, and the many uses to which these can be applied. All the Plates are reductions from 15 x 12 inch nega- tives, except, of course, the lithographic ones, which were made simply as explanatory of the preceding five. . â€¢ EXPLANATION OP THE PLATES. The first three Plates require to be studied or observed with the heading of each turned towards the right hand pf the observer,, apd in my remarks in reference to these

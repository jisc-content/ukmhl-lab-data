By Dr. Fraser. ' 17' is paired, and that what is called unpaired n9-sal‘ cavity (frorn which they derive the name of Monorhina, or single- nosti-il animals) is not this in a morphological sense at all. His describes the brain-tube as having not only a dorsal suture but also a frontal closing line, the latter extending from the infundibular recess to the angulus. ' The netu'o- pore, in the sense of His, includes the whole of the lamina from the optic recess to the angulus, while in the sense of von Kupffer it includes only the angulus. He claims to have demonstrated this frontal closing line in selachians and in the rabbit. . Bm’ckhardt (4) agrees with His that the conical projec- tion has nothing to do with the olfactory function, and that it is formed by a recess of the ventricle, which he calls recessus interolfactorius, or recessus neuroporicus, and that there is a lamina supra-neuroporica between it and the paraphysis or anterior epiphysis of the roof of the thalamic brain. As far as my own observations go I have long been familiar with the projection in the embryos of the dog- fish, bird, and mammal, but I am not as yet prepared to give a definite opinion as to whether it is a terminally situated sensory organ in the sense of von Kupffer, although this writer’s opinion is a very suggestive one, or whether it has no claim to such a morphological status in the sense of His.

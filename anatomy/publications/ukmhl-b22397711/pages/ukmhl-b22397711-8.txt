The Position of Anatomy, 4 other hand, all medical teaching was done by universities only,' and by teachers' appointed by"the" State. Com- parable acquirements and results in the shape of morpho- logical contributions to knowledge could only be looked for in our own country from those holding university positions, or similar ones in certain of the metropolitan or provincial colleges, who were in the fortunate position of having a certain amount of leisure apart from their teach- ing duties. In order to appreciate or understand Professor Kay Lankester’s positioii it was necessary to note the rise of the yoxmg school of English morphologists, due largely to the scientific insight aud forethought of the distinguished Professor of Physiology in the University of Cambridge, , who, associated with his famous pupil, the late Professor F. M. Balfour, created the great school of moi’phology in connection with that university, the Oxford side being represented by the late Professor Moseley, and now by Professor Kay Lankester. -The older representatives of Enghsh natmal science . were generally medical graduates. Professor Huxley, by far the most distinguished of those who remain, had such a training. The yoimg school, however, have little, if any, connec- tion at all with medicine, and judge us and our work by the pm-e scientific, standard, and it is in this sense that ^ Professor Ray Lankester’s judgment must be said to be tine. The human morphologist’s vision must from its natine be always a more limited one than that of the comparative morphologist, and he must recognise that it takes a Darwin to write of the “ Descent of Man,” a Huxley to fix his “ Place in Nature,” a Haeckel to speak of his “ Evolution,” and a Weismann to raise controversy regarding the “ Con- tinuity of his Germ Plasm ”—that these are men who , have garnered in their minds all the knowledge of their time in respect to organic nature, who are able to formulate

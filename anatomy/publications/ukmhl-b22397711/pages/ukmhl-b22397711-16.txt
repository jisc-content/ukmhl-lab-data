The Position of Anatomy. 12 In Fig. 5 the cranial aspect of the hemisphere wall was smooth, the striatum being simply turned down to show the cut peduncle (in this respect differing from the photograph in which it lies separate from the head). The choroid plexus was removed to show the choroid fissure. The septum pellucidum was completely absent, and the adjacent ventricles were thus thrown iuto free communication otherwise than by the foramina of Munro. The fornix, the hippocampus major and minor, the hollow olfactory lobe, the optic nerve, the divisions of the cephalic half of the striatum, and the thickness of the hemisphere wall are all to be observed. In Fig. 6 the transitory fissures are present on the median aspect of the hemisphere wall. The fissure sepa- rating the olfactory lobe from the adjacent hemisphere runs radially and serially with the others, but it is not transitory in character. Sufficient attention has not as yet been paid to this featm'e. The median aspect of the remaining divisions of the encephalon are also given in this Figure. The thalamic brain with its optic, infundibular^ and epiphysial outgrowths, its thin roof, from the epi- physis to the foramen of Munro, as Avell as its anterior Avail from the foramen of Munro to the optic recess, can be noted. In the dorsal half of this anterior Avail arise the anterior, the fornix, and the callosal commissures, the true history of which has yet to be written. The mid-brain, the isthmus, the hind- and after-brain are also to be seen. For purposes of comparison AAoth Fig. 6, I haAm given a median section through the head of a foetal dog (Fig. 4 of the same plate), and of a chick (Fig. 9 of Plate VIII.). The amount of hemisi:)here brain in all three can be noted Avith the respective olfactmy outgi'owths. The thalamic brain does not differ so markedly in the human and dog diagrams as in that of the chick, Avhere the epiphysial outgroAvth is very large and directed toAvards the front.

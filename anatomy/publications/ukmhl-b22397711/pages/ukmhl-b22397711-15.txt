11 By Dr. Fraser. sitoiy fissiires are aiTanged radially along the median aspect, and run at intervals from its dorsal to its ventral border. They are eight in number in my specimens. Of the remaining five foetuses on the plate the hemi- sphere of the smaller one (in the second row) has been dissected to show the lateral ventricles from the front. The olfactory lobes at this stage are still hollow, and com- municate freely with the ventricular cavity. In the remaining four the callosal fibres have appeared. The largest of the foiu-—that at the left upper border of the plate—shows the mechan aspect of the hemisphere brain, where the caliosum. the parieto-occipital fissure, ^nd the beginning of the calcarine can be seen, as well as the lateral aspect of the mid- and hind-brain. The remaining three show the dissections made to expose the ventricular aspect of the median wall of the hemisphere brain. In the largest of the three—the second at the left upper border of the plate—the striatum has been turued down by cutting the peduncle uniting it with the thalamus. In the foetus at the left lower border of the plate the stxiatum has been removed altogether, and is shown on the plate, lying adjacent to the head. Of the remaining foetus the head only has been dissected, and appears by itself at the left hand of the second row. The brain and cord shown by itself also on this row was placed in to show the calcarine fissure arising indepen- dently of the parieto-occipital, thus differing from its mode of oiigin in the foetus at the left upper border of the plate. In order that the reader could follow more clearly the remarks made here, I have given in Plate YII. two diagi-ams—Figs. 5 and 6 —of the two foetuses at the left loAver border of Plate IV., natural size, Avith th e main features of structure marked in. Fig. 5 is after the appearance of the callosal fibres. Fig. 6 before their appearance.

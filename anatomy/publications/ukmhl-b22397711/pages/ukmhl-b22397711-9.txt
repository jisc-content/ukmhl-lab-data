The second half of the address was taken up by thi’ow- ing on the screen examples of the manner in which my inward thought had endeavom’ed to make for itself outward expression during the preceding ten years. The screen pictures exhibited were from shdes, reductions from my 15 X 12 inch negatives. Of the latter I had made nearly one thousand, exhibiting original observations on vertebrate morphology and embryology. More than half the number dealt with the anatomy of man in his infantile and adult stages ; his external form in various positions and actions (from the living model), also his internal structure, with particular reference to his central nervous system. The smaller half dealt with the embryology of the dog- fish and salmon among fishes, with that of the frog and newt among amphibians, with that of the chick, duck, and canary among bhds, and with that of the rabbit, rat, mouse, guinea-pig, hedgehog, mole, calf, sheep, pig, dog, cat," monkey (two examples), and man amongst mammals. My observations have thus covered all the divisions of the vertebrata except reptiles, the embryos of which I have hitherto been unable to obtain, except one of a rattlesnake. I have not only photographed the external form of the several examples mentioned under the different classes, but also the serial sections into which the embryos have been cut at a direct enlargement of from ten to twenty times, so that the whole internal form can be read from the prints taken from the negatives without the trouble of looking down the microscope. The prints can be made transparent, and the sections placed in order one over the other; reconstruction figures or even models can in this tvay be made with the greatest ease. ' My observations have of necessity been much more com- plete in certain examples than iu others. In the rat I have,'

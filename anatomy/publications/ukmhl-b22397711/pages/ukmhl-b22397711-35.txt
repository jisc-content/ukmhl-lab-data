ON THE LOBUS OLFACTORIUS IMPAR. Much interest lias recently been aroused and a good deal of discussion lias followed the publication of the first part of von Kupifer’s (1) “ Studies on the Developmeut of the Head of the Crauiota.” in which he described the last connection between ectoderm aod brain-tube as forming a neuropore situated at the anterior end of the dorsal wall of the tube—that after closure the evidence of the early presence of this neuropore was always to be found as a median, hollow, beak-like process of the tube. The ectoderm over it formed a thickened plate, and this plate and the beak-like process on gradual separation were connected by a cord. The median ectodermal thickening he homologised with the olfactory pit or groove of the larval Ampbioxus (named by von Kolliker), and with the single olfactory organ of the Monorhina. The median, hollow, beak-like process he named lobus olfactorius impar (a name already given by Langerhans to the similar median projection of the medi;llary tube in Ampbioxus). The projection of the cavity of the ventricle into the lobus he named the recessus lobus olfactorius impar. The coi’d mentioned as connecting the lobe with the median olfactory ectodei-mic plate he looked upon as a median olfactory nerve. This cord and plate rapidly dis- appeared^[during the development in embryos of the higher vertebrata, but it is otherwise with the lobus and

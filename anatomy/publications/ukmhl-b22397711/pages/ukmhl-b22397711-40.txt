20 Single and Douhle Monstrosities. in two well-formed feet, which, as in the former, belonged to the adjacent sides of two pelves. Visceral duplicity was again made evident by the pre- sence of three caeca, and the single cloaca had two external apertures, which opened, one on either side of the single femoral element of the supernumerary limbs. Through the kindness of many friends in Dublin, more especially the Master of the Ooombe Hospital, I have be6n able to collect a considerable number of various forms of single and double human monsters at various ages, a large number of these being anencephahc; a smaller number being, in addition, amyelic. A peripheral nervous system was found in all the speci- ihens, with well-developed gangha on the posterior roots. What struck me in particular was the presence of a fully- developed striated muscular system, in the absence of the ventral cell in the central nervous system, as it was a well-established fact that alteration in the ventral cells of the fully-formed cord led to atrophy of the muscles, especially in children, thus showing that the role of the ventral cell in the embryonic cord must be a very dilferent one to that generally attributed to it in the fully-formed cord. It must not be forgotten, however, that the embryonic or foetal muscular system has little opportunity to display its functional capacity, and that the trophic role of the cell may not be established. I dissected carefully the reddish mass lying on the cranial base, called the substantia-medullo-vasculosa of Recklinghausen, and had found evidence therein of tlie early formation of the brainâ€”in short, the central nervous system in all the specimens had been developed at an early period, until a date, at least, after the formation of the sensory ganglia from the medullary ridge and adjacent ectoderm; then development had ceased, in the cenrial

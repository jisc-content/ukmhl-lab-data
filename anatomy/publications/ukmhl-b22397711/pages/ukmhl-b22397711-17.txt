By Dr. Fraser. 13 "The optic- commissure is also very much larger in the ■chick than in either of the others. The mid-brain region •of the dog is much more extensive than in the human, and it is not covered by the hemisphere brain. In the chick it is still more extensive than in the dog, but laterally its real extent is not shown in median section, this falhng between its lateral outgrowths. The median section of the cerebellum is also much more extensive in the chick than in either of the mammalian diagi’ams. The reader must understand in this comparison that the diagrams of the ehick and dog are enlarged 3§, whilst that of the human is natural size. Plate V. represents the lateral aspect of the central nervous system of two foetuses, about 31 cm. in length natural size (head and trunk measurement), and supposed to be about the eighth month. They are reduced in the plate to about one-third the size of nature. They require little, if any, explanation, as the anatomy is clear. The central sulcus and the two central convolutions are easily made out on the cranial surface of the respective hemis- pheres. The. various opercula do not as yet in either of them cover in the central lobe. The cephalad ends of the temporal lobes are still in some measure smooth. The features mentioned are common to the* hemispheres of both foetuses, but in the regions cephalad and caudad of the respective central convolutions a single description would not be applicable, this being more true for the caudad direction than the cephalad one. In this plate and in Plate IV. a large amount of the visceral anatomy of the thoracic and abdominal cavities is shown. It is not my piu-pose in this short summaiy to enter into this at all, but attention may be drawn to one featiu-e of interest in connection with the vertebral column. A glance at the various dissected faduses on Plate IV. Avill show that the curves in the neck and lumbar regions of

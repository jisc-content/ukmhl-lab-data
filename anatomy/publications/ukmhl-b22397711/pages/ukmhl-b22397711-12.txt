8 Position of Anatomy. upper row show the lateral aspect and have the foetal placenta attached; the two of the second row show the ventral and the dorsal aspects. _ .. The remaining embryo at the right hand of the uppov row is the finest human embryo, at this stage, in my possession. It is at the same stage of development as the' rat embryo of 12 days 16 hours immediately underneath it in the second row. The two can be compared and conclusions can be drawn by each man for himself, according to his leanings and the knowledge he possesses for forming an accurate judgment. All the embryos on this plate are enlarged about three times. In Plate VI., Figs. 1 and 2 are enlargements of the human embryo and the rat embryo of 12 days 16 hours spoken of above. I have in these diagrams roughly marked in the various divisions of the central nervous system—the hemisphere brain, the thalamic and mid-brain, the isthmus (the depression between the mid-brain and cerebellum), the cerebellum, the medulla with its thin roof, and the spinal cord. In connection with these can be seen the neck, pons, and cephahc flexures, the first of these being much better marked in the human than in the rat embrj’o. The nasal groove, the eye, the ear, as well as the various visceral arches—the maxillary, the mandibular, the hyoid, and the first branchial, the second branchial being covered in—the heart, the Kver, the fore and hind limbs, the umbilical cord, and the primitive segments in the trunk legion are all to be noted. Plate II. represents the sections under the cover-glass of one of my serial slides of a sheep embryo. They are enlarged about fom* times the size of nature, and the direction in which the sections have been made through the head can be read from the long vertical section, Fig^ 3 of Plate VI., by connecting the numeral 4 of 4th ventricle with the t of the word striatum. The sections run in rows of six, the one most eephalad being at the right

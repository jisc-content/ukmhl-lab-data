9 By Dr. Fraser. hand of the lower row, the last of the sections—that in the caudal direction—being at the left hand of the upper row. The medulla is cut in the region of its greatest width, and the membranous roof is in two divisions. In the majority of the sections the tmnia of the medulla has made its appearance. The cut thalamic and hemisphere brain lie cephalad of the head flexure. I have marked in the names of the several note- worthy features of the sections in Fig. 7 of Plate VIII., which is an enlargement of one of them. Part of the epithelial lining of the dorsal half of the thin medullary roof of the 4th ventricle has disaj)peared, the flrst step perhaps in the formation of the foramen of Majendie. The inrolling of the hemisphere wall to form the striatum, the fusion of this with the subthalamic portion of the thalamic brain, the ending of the choroid plexus at the bottom of the interpallial Assure, and its succession by the thickened part of the anterior wall of the thalamic brain, from which will arise the anterior pillars of the fornix and the callosum, the cavities of the third and lateral ventricles with the foramen of Munro, are all to be disting-uished. Plate III. represents an enlargement about three and one-third times the size of nature of the sections under the cover-glass of one of my slides, from a series of long vertical sections of the sheep. The sections are very oblique, so that the spinal cord is not shown, although all the divisions ol the developing encephalon can be recognised. I have given an enlargement of the head portion of one of the sections—Fig. 8 of Plate VIII., with the names of the several divisions marked in. 'With this Fig. has to be associated Fig. 3 of Plate VI., which is an enlargement of a section from a long vertical series of a younger embryo, in Avhich the cutting-plane fell almost parallel with the median one of the embryo. The Fig. does not represent the exact median plane, but is a little to one

(III.) ON VARIOUS SINGLE AND DOUBLE MONSTROSI- TIES, WITH REMARKS ON ANENCEPHALIC AND AMYELIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS. The impetus which led me to make the observations recorded here was obtained by the arrival of two Living fowls with supernumerary legs, one kindly forwarded and presented to me by Mr. Russel, of Limerick, and the other by Dr. Friele, of Waterford. Professor Cleland (1) has dealt with these abnormalities in so clear and masterly a manner that little remains for me to do except to corroborate. In the Limerick fowl the pelvic element of the supeimumerary Hmbs lay to the right of the tail. The femoral element was single, and the muscles in some measure developed; between the single femoral element and the pelvic remains a shghtly mov- able joint existed. The tibial element was single above and bdurcated below, the bifurcation en<iing in two well- developed feet, the one being the left foot of a right pelvis, and the other the right foot of a left pelvis. Visceral duplicity was marked by the presence of three caeca. There was only one cloaca, with a single external apertm-e. My examination has not as yet extended so far as to say whether there was any erfdence of spinal cord duplicity present. In the Waterford fowl there was no pelvic or upper femoral element present; the single lower femoral element hung froni the perineum. There were two tibim, ending

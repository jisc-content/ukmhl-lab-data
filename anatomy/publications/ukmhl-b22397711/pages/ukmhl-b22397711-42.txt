A CASE OF COMPLETE TRANSPOSITION OF THE THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL VISCERA. The specimen exhibited at the meeting and recorded here was obtained in the dissecting room during the course of the Winter Session, 1893-94. It occurred iu a female subject about forty-five years, of low statm’e, height only 4 ft. 2 in. I could not obtain any details as to the personal history. The condition must be a veiy rare one, as my personal experience has now extended over at least 1,400 subjects, and this is the first example I have met with. The transposition is complete, not only in regard to the viscera of both thorax and abdomen but also to the blood-vessels and the thoracic duct. In regard to the cause of such transpositions the most plausible theory would be to consider the female subject as having been one of twins developed from a single egg and in one set of membranes, dichotomy being complete, to support which I exhibit a double monster in which dichotomy is complete except in the thoracic region (thoracopagus), and in which the right of the two foetuses has transposition of the viscera— a fact already noted by Forster (Missbildungen des Menschen. Jena. 1865. P. 136). This same fact had been suggested by Mr. Morrant Baker to Mr. Bland Sutton, as stated iu his work on Evolution and Disease. London. 1890. P. 132. This is not the explanation given by the great embryologist, von Baer, who, on rare occasions finding the embryo with its right side dhected towai-ds the yolk instead of the left as was

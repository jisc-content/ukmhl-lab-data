By Dr. Fraser. * 7 three I will take it for granted that the reader is so observ- ing them. The remaining plates are to be studied in the direction of the heading. Plate I. represents mainly a series of rat embryos at dilferent ages and from different aspects; there is in addition a very fine human embryo and a canaiy bird embryo. The embryos are arranged in three rows, of which the lower is double towards the right hand. Of the four em- bryos which form the double part of this row, the two smaller are at 10 days 16 hours date after union of the sexes. The heart, and the cephalic and allantoic ends of the embryo can be noted. The medullary groove, except in the region of the mid-brain, is still in great part unclosed. The two larger are at 11 days 16 homs, at which date the various divisions of the encephalon can be recognised. Of the visceral arches, the mandibular is the most promi- nent, and the Hmbs are budding from the side of the trunk. The remaining five embryos of this lower row and the two at the right hand of the second row are seven members of a family of rats at 12 days 16 hom-s. Four of the seven show the lateral aspect, two the front aspect, and the remaining one (the last at the left hand of the lower row) the dorsal aspect, in particular the fossa rhom- boidalis, the beginning cerebellmn and the mid-brain. In all these embryos the several divisions of the central nervous system can be readily observed, the budding hemisphere brain, the thalamic and mid-brain, the isthmus, the two lateral plates which are to unite to form the cere- bellum, and the great extent of the after brain or medullaâ€” all are to be noted. Of the three remaining embryos of the second row, the last one at the left hand is the front aspect of a canary embryo of about the sixth day. The other two and the fwo at the left hand of the upper row are four members of a family of rats at 13 days 16 hours. The two of the

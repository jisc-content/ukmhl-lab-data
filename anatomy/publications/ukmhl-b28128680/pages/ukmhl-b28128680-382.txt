SAUNDERS' BOOKS ON 4 EiservdröctK’s Clirvicad Ar\a.torr\y A NEW WORK—RECENTLY ISSUED A Text=Book of Clinical Anatomy. By Daniel N. Eisendrath, A.B., M.D., Professor of Clinical Anatomy, Medical Department of the University of Illinois (College of Physicians and Surgeons), Chicago; Attending Surgeon to the Cook County Hospital, etc. Handsome octavo of 515 pages, beautifully illustrated with entirely original illustrations. Beautifully bound in Cloth, 21 s. net. WITH MANY BEAUTIFUL ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS The subject of anatomy, and especially clinical anatomy, is so closely allied to practical medicine and surgery that it is absolutely impossible for a physician or surgeon to practice his profession successfully unless he have an intimate knowledge of the human structure. This work is intended to serve as a guide and reference book to the general practitioner as well as a text-book for the student. It treats of practical anatomy—anatomy which it is necessary for the physician to have at his certain command at the bedside, in the clinic, and in the operating room. The entire subject is discussed with the thoroughness and preciseness that spring from experience, and the author’s style is clear and con- cise. The method of illustrating the subject is novel, especial attention being given to surface anatomy. The illustrations themselves are the result of a great deal of painstaking study, the great majority of them being from new and original drawings and photographs. They are reproduced in the highest style of art, and show far better than those in any similar work the relation of anatomic structures from a clinical standpoint, presenting to the student a picture of anatomy as he meets it at the bedside, with the skin covering the tissue. A portion of each chapter is devoted to the examination of the living through palpation and marking of surface outlines of landmarks, vessels, nerves, thoracic and abdominal viscera. For the student and practitioner alike, the work will be found unrivaled. Medical Record, New York “The thoroughly practical manner in which the author has performed HIS TASK WILL MEET WITH GENERAL APPROBATION. ... A SPECIAL RECOMMENDATION FOR THE FIGURES IS THAT THEY ARE MOSTLY ORIGINAL AND WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE IN VIEW. The SECTIONS OF JOINTS AND TRUNKS ARE THOSE OF FORMALINIZED CADAVERS AND ARE UNIMPEACHABLE IN ACCURACY.”

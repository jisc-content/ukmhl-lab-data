REVIEW QUESTIONS. I7I REVIEW QUESTIONS. Where may the pulsations of the femoral artery be felt? How may the location of the acetabulum be projected upon the surface of the body? How does the ligamentum teres of the hip-joint manifest its importance after an intracapsular fracture of the neck of the femur? Of what importance is the attachment of the capsular ligament of the hip for the nature of (that is, in deciding the nature of) the fractures of the neck of the femur ? Where are the weak places in the capsular ligament of the hip? What bursa frequently communicates with the hip-joint? From what regions do the so-called inguinal glands receive their lymph? What landmarks aid in the location of the sciatic nerve? What is the practical significance of the loose connective tissue accompanying the sciatic nerve? What effect may a posterior dislocation at the knee or a fracture of the lower end of the femur have upon the popliteal vessels and upon the internal popliteal nerve? What are the important bursas communicating with the knee-joint, and what are they which do not communicate with this articulation? What relation must be borne in mind in exposing the popliteal artery? Where may the posterior tibial artery be easily ligated, what synovial sheath is thereby endangered, and in the division of what tendon must the position of the artery be remembered ? How may the position of the ankle-joint be indicated externally? What landmarks are employed to find the lines of Chopart’s and of Lisfranc’s articulations?

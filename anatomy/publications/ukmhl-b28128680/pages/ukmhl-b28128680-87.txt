55 THE ORAL CAVITY. and to either side will be observed the sublingual folds, which project in varying degrees in differ- ent subjects. These folds are due to the upper margins of the sublingual glands, and to their inner side the submaxillary ducts may be exposed (for the extraction of salivary calculi, for ex- ample). The posterior portion of the sublingual gland lies upon the mylohyoid muscle, while the remainder of the gland is closely related to the inner surface of the mandible, where it produces the sublingual fossa of varying depth. The numerous invisible orifices of the gland are situated upon the sublingual folds. The sublingual gland frequently possesses a larger duct [ductus junction) or HARD AND SOFT PALATES X- BICUSPID.

The opening of the submaxillary duct (Wharton’s) may be recognized, with the naked eye, in the sublingual caruncle at the anterior extremity of the plica sublingualis. [This duct and the lingual nerve lie beneath and to the inner side of the sublingual gland; the nerve on its way to the tongue crosses the duct on its inferior aspect opposite the anterior border of the hyoglossus muscle.—Ed.]

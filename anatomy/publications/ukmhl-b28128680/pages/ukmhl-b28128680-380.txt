Handsome octavo volume of 827 pages, containing 399 superb original illustrations and 3 litho- graphic plates. Cloth, 2 guineas net. WITH 399 SUPERB ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS This work is one of the most magnificent medical books ever published, con- taining some four hundred beautiful illustrations, in the preparation of which the artists of the Johns Hopkins Hospital have spent many years. Each beautifully and accurately portrays the condition represented, and together they form a magnifi- cent collection unequaled by those in any other work on the subject ever placed upon the market. A large amount of original work has been done for the ana- tomic chapter, for which over one hundred original illustrations have been made. Appendicitis naturally receives the fullest consideration. The pathology is not only amply and clearly described, but it is beautifully illuminated with an abun- dance of illustrations depicting the pathologic conditions with rare fidelity. Diag- nosis and treatment, by far the most important sections to the practitioner and surgeon, are elaborately discussed and profusely illustrated. Special chapters are devoted to the peculiarities ot appendicitis in children, and to the characteristics of the vermiform appendix in typhoid fever. An unusual chapter, but one of the greatest value to both the medical and legal professions, is that on the medicolegal status of appendicitis. A valuable contribution to the study of the relative fre- quency of diseases of the appendix consists in the presentation of the results of several thousand autopsies.

THE MEDIASTINUM. 109 finger may consequently be passed behind both of these structures into the sinus transversus pericardii, which is bounded anteriorly by the posterior surface of the pulmonary artery and of the aorta, and posteriorly by the anterior wall of the auricles (consisting chiefly of the left auricle). The aorta and the pulmonary artery are the only vessels around which the finger may be passed after the pericardial sac has been opened. None of the other vessels possess a complete covering of visceral pericardium at their cardiac extremities, but they are all more or less distinctly visible Diaphragm Innominate artery Orifice of azygos major Superior vena cava— Orifice of right inferior pulmonary Sinus transversus pericardii Ascending aorta Pulmonary artery Bronchi of left superior vein Orifice of left inferior pulmonary vein Left vagus nerve Fig. 51.—The dorsal half of a frontal section of the pericardium with the large vessels. An opening has been made in the posterior wall of the pericardium so that the esophagus is exposed. (Formalin preparation.) in the pericardium. From in front, the superior vena cava may be seen high up and to the right alongside of the aorta; the inferior vena cava is visible when the heart is pushed upward and to the left; the left pulmonary veins are exposed by holding the heart upward and to the right by means of its apex; the right pulmonary veins are scarcely to be seen because they are covered by the right auricle. By moving the heart about in this manner it will be seen that it is suspended in the pericardial cavity by the great vessels. The removal of the heart may consequently be

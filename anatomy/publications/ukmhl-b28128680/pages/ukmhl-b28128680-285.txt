The study of the pelvic region should be preceded by a review of the innominate bones and of the sacrum as well as by a consideration of the bony pelvis as a whole. The following designa- tions, referable to the entire pelvis, should be thoroughly understood by the reader: The false and true pelves (separated from each other by the iliopectineal line); the symphysis pubis; the sacroiliac articulation; the promontory; the acetabulum with its articular portion (facies lunata), non-articular portion (fossa acetabuli), and cotyloid notch (incisura acetabuli); the pubic angle (in the male); the pubic arch (in the female); the obturator foramen; and the following sagittal diameters of the pelvis (Fig. 70): 1. The anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet from the promontory to the upper margin of the symphysis (conjugata vera), about 11.0 centimeters (4J- inches);

American Journa.1 of the Medica.1 Sciences “ The work produces a favorable impression by the general manner in which the subject is treated. Its descriptions are concise and clear, and the treatment sound. The physical examination of the injured part is well described, and . . . the method of making these examinations is illus- trated by a liberal use of cuts.”

5 EDITOR’S PREFACE. The distinguishing feature of Prof. Oscar Schultze’s “Topographic Anatomy” is that it contains the essentials of regional anatomy and omits the exceptional or relatively unimportant details. While it does not claim to contain all the important facts of regional anatomy, it may justly claim that all the facts contained have important medical and surgical bearings. Present- ing these in a graceful, forceful, and brief manner, it avoids the tedium of those books which, attempting to include everything, become more cumbrous and even less practical than the larger text-books on systematic anatomy. The editor’s task has been to make the text conform to Eng- lish and American nomenclature and to add occasional notes which are duly bracketed and signed. The translation of the German text has been done with admirable clearness and accuracy by Dr. W. Hersey Thomas. Having already found favor in Germany, it is hoped and believed that a like reception awaits it in America, and that it will here again realize the author’s wish to make a book for those who are or who will be doctors.

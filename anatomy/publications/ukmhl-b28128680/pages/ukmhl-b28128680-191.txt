THE MEDIASTINUM. IQS Our chief interest in the mediastinum is naturally directed toward the heart, the methodical examination of which in the living by percussion and auscultation is one of the most brilliant and permanent results of the medical art. The study of the position of the heart should be preceded by a thorough study of the structure of the organ. The Position of the Heart.—For our purpose I will designate as the cardiac axis a line drawn from the apex of the heart to the root of the aorta. Take an ordinary pointed lead-pen- cil in the hand and assume that it represents the cardiac axis. Hold this “axis” vertically over Descending aorta Esophagus' Arch of aorta with left subclavian a.' Superior lobe of left lung Pulmonary artery - Left coronary artery — Pericardium — pulmonary artery lobe of right lung auricle Superior lobe of left lung azygos major of bifurcation of trachea Pericardial cavity Right pleural cavity Inferior lobe of left lung Diaphragm Hepatic vein in inferior vena cava Fig. 49.—A view of the dorsal surface of a frontal section of the thorax. the middle of the sternum with the apex downward, under the supposition that the right (venous) heart is in the right half and the left (arterial) heart is in the left half of the body, and that the intermediate septum is exactly in the median line. Now consider the four following points and carry out the movements of the axis with the lead-pencil. 1. The axis is not placed vertically, but obliquely, so that the apex (point of lead-pencil) is directed to the left and the base (blunt end of lead-pencil) to the right. 2. The axis, and consequently the entire heart, is pushed to the left, so that the median plane of the body does not correspond to the median plane of the heart, but passes through this

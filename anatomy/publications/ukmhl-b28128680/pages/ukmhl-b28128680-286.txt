TOPOGRAPHIC AND APPLIED ANATOMY. 144 PLATE 19. The male pelvic outlet as seen from without. From a Leipzig model from nature (His) with the vessels and nerves sketched in. 2. The internal conjugate diagonal, measured in the living subject from the promontory to the lower margin of the symphysis (conjugata diagonalis), 12.5 centimeters (5 inches); 3. The anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic cavity or the width of the pelvis, from the middle of the symphysis to the middle of the third sacral vertebra, 12.5 centimeters (5 inches); Fig. 70.—A sagittal section of the female pelvis with the anteroposterior pelvic diameters. 1, The anteropos- terior diameter of the pelvic inlet (conjugata vera); 2, the internal conjugate diagonal (conjugata diagonalis); 3, the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic cavity; 4, the anteroposterior diameter of the plane of pelvic contraction; 5, the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet; A, the pelvic axis or curve. 4. The anteroposterior diameter of the plane of pelvic contraction, from the lower margin of the symphysis to the intervertebral disc between the last sacral and the first coccygeal vertebra, 11.5 centimeters (4§- inches); 5. The anteroposterior diameter 0} the pelvic outlet from the lower margin of the symphysis to the tip of the coccyx, 10 to 12 centimeters (4 to 5 inches). This diameter varies on account of the ability of the coccyx to become displaced posteriorly. The pelvic axis (A in Fig. 70) or pelvic curve is the curved line which connects the middle points of the anteroposterior diameters. •Anterior superior spine of ilium Fifth lumbar verte- bra First sacral vertebra Lateral sacral inferior spine of ilium Lower sacrosciatic ligament First coccygeal ver- tebra

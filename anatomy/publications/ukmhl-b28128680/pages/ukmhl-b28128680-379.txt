SAUNDER-S’ BOOKS on SURGERY and ANATOMY W. B. SAUNDERS COMPANY 9. HENRIETTA ST.. COVENT GARDEN, LONDON PHILADELPHIA NEW YORK 925 Walnut Street Fuller Building, Fifth Ave. and 23d St. SAUNDERS’ REMARKABLE SUCCESS 1A7E are often asked to account for our extraordinary success. ^ * We can but point to modern business methods, carefully per- fected business machinery, and unrivalled facilities for distribution of books. Every department is so organized that the greatest possible amount of work is produced with the least waste of energy. The representatives of the firm are men with life-long experience in the sale of medical books. Then, too, we must not overlook that major force in the modern business world—advertising. We have a special department devoted entirely to the planning, writing, and placing of advertising matter; and we might mention that the money annually spent in advertising now far exceeds the entire annual receipts of the House during its earlier years. These extraordinary facilities for dis- posing of large editions enable us to devote a large amount of money to the perfecting of every detail in the manufacture of books.

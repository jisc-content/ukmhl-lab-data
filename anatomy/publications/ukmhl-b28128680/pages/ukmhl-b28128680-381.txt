Hand- some octavo of about 1000 pages, with 559 beautiful illustrations, nearly all original. Beautifully bound in Cloth, 25s. net. WITH 559 BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS, NEARLY ALL ORIGINAL This absolutely new work completely covers the surgical anatomy and operative technic involved in the operations of general surgery. Constructed on thoroughly new lines, the discussion of the subject is remarkably systema- tized and arranged in a manner entirely original. Being the work of a teacher of extensive experience who, as such, is thoroughly familiar with the wants of students and general practitioners, the book is eminently practical and the sub- ject treated in such a manner as to render its comprehension most easy. This practicability of the work is particularly emphasized in the numerous magnifi- cent illustrations which form a useful and striking feature. There are some 559 of them. All have been drawn especially for this book, and they depict the pathologic conditions and the progressive steps in the various operations detailed with unusual fidelity, their artistic and mechanical excellence being of the highest standard. The text has been brought precisely down to the present day, all the recent advances along the line of technic having been fully discussed, and elucidated with many illustrations. A distinguishing and extremely useful feature is the treatment of the anatomic side of the subject in connection with the operative technic. Anatomy of the human body is of the utmost impor- tance in the practical application of operative surgery, for unless the surgeon know the exact location of the various muscles, bones, etc., he will cause unnecessary destruction of tissue, and perhaps irreparable injury.

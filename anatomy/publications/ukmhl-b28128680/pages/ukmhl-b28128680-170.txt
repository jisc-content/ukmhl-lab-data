TOPOGRAPHIC AND APPLIED ANATOMY PLATE 7. A posterior view of a dissection of the thoracic, and of a portion of the cervical viscera. The relation of the bronchi, arteries, and veins at the hilus of the lungs. From a Leipzig model from nature (His). occasionally encountered in the infraclavicular fossa in ligating the first portion of the axillary artery (see page 73 and Fig. 28). The Inferior Boundary of the Thorax.—The diaphragm forms a muscular dome-shaped partition which constitutes the inferior boundary of the thorax. The right side of the dome, which covers the liver, projects upward more markedly than does the left side. The central tendon is flatter and has a more restricted range of motion during respiration (review the lumbar, costal, and sternal portions of the muscle with their origins). The structures passing through Diaphragm Pericardium Left phrenic nerve Vertebral arch Spinal cord Vena Right pulmonary Right phrenic nerve Foramen ratum of vertebra Vena azygos minor Fig. 44.—The diaphragm and the inferior half of the pericardium seen from above. Formalin preparation (child). the diaphragm from above downward are: the descending aorta through the aortic opening; the esophagus and the pneumogastric nerves through the esophageal opening; the 'splanchnic nerves, from the sympathetic, between the crus mediale and the crus intermedium of the lum- bar portion; the sympathetic nerve itself between the crus intermedium and the crus laterale of the lumbar portion; and the superior epigastric artery, from the internal mammary between the sternal and costal portions (the so-called fissure of Larrey). The structures passing through the diaphragm from below upward are: the inferior vena cava (accompanied by a filament from the right phrenic nerve), through the foramen quadratum in the right side of the central tendon; the vena azygos major (on the right side) and the vena azygos minor (on the left side), accom-

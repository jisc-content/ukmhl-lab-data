TOPOGRAPHIC AND APPLIED ANATOMY. I IO accomplished by simply dividing all of the large vessels. When this is done, the posterior wall of the pericardium with the lumina of the blood-vessels is distinctly visible (Fig. 51). The posterior pericardial wall possesses no reflection of mediastinal pleura, but is directly in contact with the loose connective tissue of that portion of the mediastinal space which is situated behind the heart (see Fig. 50). In this location the structure nearest to the heart is the esophagus, which often forms a slight prominence in the pericardial sac, and which may always be palpated through the pericardium in the dead subject and easily exposed (Fig. 51). Diaphragm Broad ligament of liver Fig. 52.â€”The anterior thoracic wall with the pericardium and the diaphragm seen from within. The dashed and dotted lines represent the anterior pleural limits; between them, at the level of the fifth left costal cartilage, is the site for aspiration of the pericardial cavity.

Innominate artery It is at this point that the deposition of a considerable quantity of pericardial exudate may press upon the esophagus and produce dysphagia. By irritation of the vagus nerve (Fig. 51) pericarditis in this situation may also cause vomiting, hiccough, and paralysis of the vocal cords. This practical and important relation will be referred to again when we discuss the esophagus in detail.

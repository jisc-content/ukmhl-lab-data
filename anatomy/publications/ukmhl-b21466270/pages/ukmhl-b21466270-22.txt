18 THE HUNTERIAN ORATIOX. and the habit which he naturally has of considering himself the centre of the universe, this might in the language of science be called an accident. For, in all science, it is the rule to proceed from the simpler to the more elaborate phenomena ; but in comparative anatomy the reverse is the case :—we be- gin with man, the most complex, and proceed down- wards to the simpler forms of life. The first comparative anatomist whose writings we have—Aristotle—set this example, and gave his reason for it. " Just as," he says, " in examining coins, each " one takes as his standard that coin which he knows " best, so it is with everything else. But man is, of " course, the best known to us of all the animals." Therefore he begins his work with a description of the parts of man. Now Aristotle, with all his anatomical errors, made a splendid beginning, and his enormous genius—^which, considering the field of his labours, towers over the average stature of genius like the giant Brien^^ from his glass case over his astonished visitors—his enormous genius, I say, so dazzled the men who came after Mm, that, instead of pursuing his investigations, they even worshipped his errors. And his anatomy was not in a state to be thus enshrined, far from it. If he did dissect human bodies, yet his opportunities of doing so were few, and he was, consequently, driven to an expedient which became the source of many mistakes. I will quote his own words. He says, after speak- ing of the external anatomy of man:

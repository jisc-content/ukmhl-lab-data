THE HUNTERIAN ORATION. 21 trine was, probably, most mischievous in retarding the discovery of the circulation of the blood. Other- wise the description of the lesser circulation, so com- pletely given by Servetus in his work entitled, " Chris- tianismi Eestitutio," must, one would think, have led sooner to the discovery of the greater.

A pig was therefore brought into the royal chamber, and opened in the presence of the sick man. The exact posi- tion of the heart was shown to him : if in a pig, there- fore in a prince. His highness gave way before this argument, and the plaster was placed accordingly, while the physician, who still had the temerity to de- fend himself by drawing an anatomical distinction between man and pig, was dismissed from the court.^^ This then was the state of anatomy in Europe which Vesalius and Fallopius and the men of their time, were engaged in reforming. Comparative anatomy had been used to supplement human anatomy ; and it was now to be laid aside, till it could be established

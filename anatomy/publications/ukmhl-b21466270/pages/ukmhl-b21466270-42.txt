THE HUNTERIAN ORATION. 38 mind, he happened to become acquainted with Dr. Oullen, who was then just established in practice at Hamilton. Dr. Cullen's conversation soon determined him to lay aside all thoughts of the Church, and to devote himself to the profession of physic. His father's consent having been previously obtained, W. Hun- ter, in 1737, went to reside with Dr. Cullen. In the family of this excellent friend and preceptor, he passed nearly three years; and these, as he has been often heard to acknowledge, were the happiest years of his life. See ' Life of Dr. Cullen.' 12. Dr. Eobert Hamilton was Professor of Anatomy and Botany, but gave no lectures on Botany.—' Life of Cullen,' vol. i. p. 2 4. 13.

'Life of John Hunter,' by Drewiy Ottley, prefixed to the ' Works of John Hunter,' by James F. Palmer. London, 1837. This Life is certainly the best. Nevertheless, whUe finding fault with other memoirs of John Hunter, and professing to wiite ' a full and faithful account' of him, Ottley does not hesitate to adopt the erroneous story that ' Himter's father died in 1738, . . . and John was thus left, at ten years of age, to the care of a fond and apparently over-indulgent mother,' p. 3. Again further on, at p. 6, he shows a want of accuracy in stating a fact, which, if worth stating, should have been stated correctly; namely, that ' John Hunter was in his twentieth year,' when he wrote to his brother in London to offer his services. Now, J. H. himself states that he came to London in September 1748. Surely, therefore, born in Feb- ruary 1728, he must have been advanced in his twenty-fii-st year. 17. ' Hist. Anim.'i. 6 ed.

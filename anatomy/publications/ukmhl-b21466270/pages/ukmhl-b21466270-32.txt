THE HUNTERIAN ORATION. 28 in Sydenham ; but wherever else we look in the century which intervened between our two great countrymen, we find nothing but unintelligible conftision. It was in vain that Bacon had raised his voice to herald the age of experimental science; the advice, which he gave specially to physicians, fell on deaf ears. There never was a time when there were so many or such various theories of life and disease. Even the new discoveries gained by the experimental method seemed to be used chiefly as bases for new theories of fantastic imagina- tion. Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was, I believe, especially fertile in mathematical theories of vital phenomena. And then the chemists were very busy and ingenious. I do not know much about the various systems of these theorists and their origins and histories. I know more of the points, at least, in which they agree than of the characteristics by which they differ; and they all agree in thisâ€”that they are all unintelHgible and all forgotten. Far be it from me to wish to introduce them into this theatre! Let their names perish with them ! And so said Hunter, who found them all flourish- ing and quarrelHng. He brushed them all aside, and set about investigating nature for himself. In physio- logy he saw the road to a true pathology, and physiology meant comparative physiology and experi- ment, and therefore comparative anatomy. . . . " For ten years," says Fischer of Hannover, "Hunter dissected only human subjects, and " then began with animals, for he found that only " comparative anatomy could give any satisfac-

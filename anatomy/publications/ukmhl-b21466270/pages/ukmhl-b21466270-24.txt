THE IIUXTERIAX OTJATIOX. 20 whicli is a dangerous thing; and I will give a few •examples of the errors which it led to, the hindrance which they caused, and the history of their overthrow. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, much erroneous doctrine was held concerning the muscles of the eye. Vesalius, for instance, maintained the existence of the " retractor oculi" muscle in man.^° And when Fallo- pius (who, being a later, had become a more "accurate anatomist) demonstrated that this muscle existed only in some quadrupeds,^^ yet Vesalius still persisted in his opinion, and attributed the fact of Pallopius not finding the muscle to the supposed extreme emaciation of the human bodies which he had examined.^^ On the other hand, Sylvius had to defend Galen's sternum of seven bones against the assault of Vesalius, who demonstrated that there were but three. In the discussion that ensued, Sylvius had to admit the fact, but he was undaunted, and rephed that, however men might be made in then- time, it was well known that in the time of Galen they had more bones in their sternum. Again, Vesalius corrected Galen's description of the omentum which had been pictured from the dissection of the lower animals ; '^^^ and he set right the anatomy of the pylorus which Galen had borrowed from the dog;^^ and the size and relations of the cjecum which had been introduced from the carnivorous animals.^s But more important still, there is a possibility that it was some knowledge of the construction of the heart in reptiles which supported the theory of the porosity " of the inter-ventricular septum.

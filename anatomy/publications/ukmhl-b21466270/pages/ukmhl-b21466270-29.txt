25 THE HUNTEEIAN ORATION. And the study of anatomy and physiology cannot but do all this in the hands of an able and earnest teacher, who aims at something higher than a mere loading the memory with what are justly called dull and dry facts. Such a teacher will make his pupil feel at ease in a maze of detail in which he is apt to be bewildered ; he will have a clue ready at every turn, and not depend on one way only for threading the difficulties, from which way he dare not trn-n, either to right or left, lest he should himself be lost; he will infuse hfe into the dead body, connect function with structure, and never omit to point out the useful ap- plication of each item of knowledge. Now Hunter's writings teem with examples which show what an impressive teacher he was, how supreme was his skill in turning all his knowledge to account, and with what happy enthusiasm he started others on the road to gain knowledge for themselves. To take a single instance, I would especially point to his de- scription of the organs of mastication and digestion. I commend this to the study of everyone who wishes to be a learner or a teacher of anatomy. For myself, I can only say that, when I first read it, it filled me with astonishment. Would to Heaven, I said, that we had the whole of anatomy described in this powerful way ! We should then hear fewer com- plaints of its " dryness and dulness." The language is so lucid, so terse, and withal so pictorial. There is an interest, too, and charm in every detail, and with each fact is given some illustration, with all the text its proper and full context.

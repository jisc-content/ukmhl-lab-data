THE HUNTERIAN ORATION. 31 ability as a human anatomist. To show him as a com- parative anatomist we must go into his Museum. If he could enter it himself after an absence from the earth of eighty seven years, I do not know whether he would be more pleased at finding it so little altered, or, at its having been so much enlarged. It is true that one section—that of the stuffed birds—has disappeared altogether. (I am indebted to our highly-valued curator, Professor Elower, for this and for other information con- cerning the state of the Museum.) It is true that some sections have been so much enlarged that he would scarcely recognise them. There are three thousand specimens of skulls, for instance, in the place of his fifty, and his pathological specimens have been more than doubled. But in the series of comparative physiology, on which he bestowed the most pains, he would see the very materials, which he gathered with his own hands to lay the broad foundations of his new science, still in the same order in which he had placed them; he would see his own arrangement rigidly adhered to in every detail, and his own specimens still outnumbering the additions of a century. Considering the immense progress wliich has been made in these sciences since the time of his death, the changes of systems which have taken place, and the vast materials which research is always contributing to natural history—this would be a great triumph for him, and a proud verification of his own blunt pre- diction :— " When this John Hunter is gone, you will not " easily get another."

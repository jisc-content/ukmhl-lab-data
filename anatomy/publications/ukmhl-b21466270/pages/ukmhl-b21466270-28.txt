HUNTERIAN ORATION. to Obtain a mastery of his subject, and of the art of teaching it. The inexperienced Demonstrator, new to his work, IS too apt to be over-zealous in his office The' very novelty of his position prompts him to be too ready to relieve the students in their dissections ; and he is even glad of the opportunity of doing for them the work which should be done by them—and must be done by them, if they are to master their subject. And the effect of all this is seen, too plainly, in the sad results of our examinations, both primary and pass —results which I, for one, should hesitate to impute entirely to the severity of the examiners or to the remissness of the students. How often, when we place the beautiful prepara- tions of the Museum before the candidates, do they gaze at them as at objects imported from another world, the like of which they had never so much as dreamt of! How often do we find that it is the simplest and most elementary questions that they are most unable to answer ! And where does the blame lie ? Let us look a little more closely to our teaching. This I think we may fairly regard with suspicion. The average mind is so keenly ahve to subjects in which it is interested, that it is hard to beheve the results which we see, are the best attainable by teachers who have awakened the interest of their pupils as it might be awakened ; for, surely, as man is the crown of the visible creation, the study of man may be made to excite more wonder, reveal more beauty, and convey more instruction than almost any other subject whatever.

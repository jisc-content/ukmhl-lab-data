17 THE HUNTERIAN ORATION. boy whose manhood was so wonderful,—whether it was an early tendency, accidentally held back and thwarted for a time, and then suddenly let loose, with all its originahty favom-ed by its never having been caught and netted in a systematic teaching, or the tardy development of a rare mind that grew silently to greatness in the shadow of its own strength —be this as it may, we must admit that the activity and practical hfe of Hunter began with his settling in London, and that the last forty-four years of his hfe are the real and worthy subject of our considera- tion at the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England. And there is one division of this period which I, as a practical anatomist, am especially disposed to make. To many it may seem an arbitrary one; but I hope that my view of it will, in your opinion, be justi- fied by the considerations with which I shall support it. I am inclined, then, to distinguish in John Hunter the human anatomist from the comparative anatomist, and to say that we have in him an admirable example' of the method of the two studies, and of the manner in which they should both be pursued for the advance- ment of medical science.

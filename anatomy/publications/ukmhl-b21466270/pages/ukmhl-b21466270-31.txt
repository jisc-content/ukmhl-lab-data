THE HUNTERIAN OEATION. 27 logy, that led him to his goal. He had had predecessors and teachers in anatomy, but in physiology he planned and struck out a highway of his own. "Eeason tells us, if my authority carries " any weight in this matter, that disease, however " hostile its causes may be to the human body, is "nothing else than Nature exerting all her " strength in an effort to destroy morbific material, " in order to save the sick man." Now these are not Hunter's words. They are the first words of Sydenham in his book on Acute Diseases. They are Sydenham's theory of pathology, written in 1676â€”nearly a hundred years before Hunter's time. He separates decisively the causes of disease from the symptoms of disease, and compares the symptoms to healthy physiological processes. We read and admire. It is a theory which Hunter would have accepted, indeed he might have written the very words. It is the result which he arrived at independently, which we all now accept, and which we may take for the very basis of our practice. As far, then, as the general theory of disease went, Hunter was not original. But he was original in the manner which is more useful to mankind. He demonstrated absolutely the truth of Sydenham's view of disease, especially with regard to inflammation, and, by his observation and experiment, placed the whole matter beyond the field of theory. Nor was the view which his lofty intellect thus actually established at all commonly received in his day. We find very good sense

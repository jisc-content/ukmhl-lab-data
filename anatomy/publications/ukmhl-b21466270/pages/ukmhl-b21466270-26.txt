Not that our country was lacking in great men: on the contrary, it would be impossible to write the history of anatomy without giving proud promi- nence to British names ; but these men were all taught abroad. The new era began in 1720, when Monro estabhshed the first school of anatomy in Great Britain at Edinburgh, and there was no school, worthy of the name, in England, before Wilham Hunter, no doubt in emulation of his old master Monro, founded his school in London, We may still see the spacious build- ing in Great Windmill Street, which contained William Hunter's famous Museum, and in which he gave the opportunity to Enghsh physicians of learning anatomy, for the first time, in their own country.

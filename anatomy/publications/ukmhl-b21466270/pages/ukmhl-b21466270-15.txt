11 THE HUNTEEIAN QEATION. some of the doubts and questions wMch must then have been engaging his young mind ? Sir, I am not sceptical by nature, and perhaps, if I had not been called upon to set my seal to it, I might not have questioned this version of the matter at all. But the more I considered it, the more my doubts increased, and I determined to examine afresh all our sources of information. I soon discovered an error in the dates. I found that John Hunter was not, as is commonly supposed, about ten years old, but nearly fourteen, when his father died. And this fact has a signal value, for it leads to the almost certain inference that John was educated at the same school as his brothers, and that he was brought under the in- fluence of proper training during those most impor- tant years of a boy's life. That this is the true version can hardly be doubted. Indeed, it is difficult to account for the origin of the opposite statement; for in Simmons's " Life of WiUiam Hunter," we may read that beautifid letter ^ which the father wrote in the summer of 1741, almost within three months of his deathâ€”a letter which has been so often .quoted with admiration. This letter bears witness, not only to the date of the writer's death, but to another most important fact, namely, that he maintained, to the very end of his hfe, a clear and sound judgment, as well as the tenderest and wisest interest in the welfare of his children. In short, the letter proves that, of all fathers in the world to have neglected a son, this father would have been the very last.

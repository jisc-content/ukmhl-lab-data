In entering on the Second Part, which constitutes the most important Division in this Volume, it may be proper to repeat the remark ah-eady expressed in the Introduction; namely, that the Observations prefixed to the Sections are not to be considered as designed to present any thing like a complete illustration of the subjects comprised in them; but merely as incidental additions, to increase the interest of some particular points. It is obvious, that the illustra- tion of the Part now before us would require nothing less than a system of Pathological Anatomy, and far exceed the limits prescribed to this work. The numerous inspections which it has fallen to the Author's lot to make, or witness, during the last ten years, have afForded opportunities of examining the greater num- ber of Pathological alterations, to which the various organs of the human body are hable, and, as he believes, have furnished him with motives for modifying or adding to the descriptions which have been given of some of them. Although this circumstance has necessarily influenced the arrangement and description of some of the Preparations beloncring to this Part, the Author has reframed from entering into details which rather belong to his Lectures on Morbid Anatomy, than to the Catalogue of the Museum.

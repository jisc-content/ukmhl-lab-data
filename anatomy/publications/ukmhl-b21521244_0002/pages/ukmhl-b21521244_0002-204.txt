OIISERVATIONS ON SECTION IV. OF PART II. the First Part of the Catalogue, is now engaged in a Work which will embrace the Pathology as well as the Anatomy and Physiology of the Brain. The following may be pointed out as some of the most interesting Preparations in this Section: 1572*, 1573, 1574, 1575, 1576% 1576«, 1576^ 1576°, 1589, 1594, 1602, and 1604. Amongst the Preparations of diseased Integuments, may be noticed, as belonging to this Section—although, on account of its size, it has been placed with the Miscellaneous on the Ground Floor—No. 967, a very fine specimen of Elephantiasis affecting the Foot; with which, through the kindness of Sir Astley Cooper, the Collection has been enriched by R. C. Thomas, Esq. of Barbadoes. In this part of the Section may also be observed 1621 and 1622, and several injected Preparations made by Sir Astley Cooper, illus- trative of Sphacelus affecting the Skin. 1666, 1667, and 1668, specimens of Fungoid disease affecting the Nasal Cavities, concur in illustrating the ten* dency which the disease, when so situated, has to extend , to the anterior and lower part of the middle Lobes of the Brain. 1669 is a good specimen of Melanosis of the Eye. The exciting cause of the affection was, in this case, supposed to be the violent effects of retching, during a sea-voyage. 1669*, and 1669", Ears of Children who had been deaf and dumb, exhibit, nevertheless, no marked deviations from the natural state. The Editor has been equally un- successful in his attempts to ascertain the cause of Deaf- ness, in the examination of the Ears of other individuals who had been similarly deficient in the sense of hearing. In one instance, the Membrana Tympani was perforated on one side; and on both it appeared to be placed in a more horizontal position than is quite natural. In another case, the Ossicula Auditds were restrained by preterna- tural membranous bands. He has never seen any trace of the caseous matter which has been described as causmg Deafness, by filling up the Tympanum. In every instance, the Labyrinth was to all appearance healthy, and contamed a limpid colourless fluid.

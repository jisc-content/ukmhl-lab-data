THE HEART, AND DESCRIPTION. â€¢ Reference to History. By whom presented, or whence de- rived. 1392 Heart, in which there is Hypertrophy and dilatation of the left Ventricle, and dilatation of both Auricles with- out adhesion of the Pericardium ; and little, if any, Valvular disease. The patient, about 55 years of age, died very suddenly : he had lone: been af- fected with Dyspnoea, but was not Anasarcous. 3d Green Insp. Book, page 79. Case of Joseph Lake. 1392* Heart of a Foetus, in which the sides are transposed: the Aorta arising from the right Ventricle. 1393 Heart, in which the Cellular structure in the substance of the left Ventricle is partially thickened and indurated : the Aortic Valves nearly closed by bony matter almost filling their cups. The Aorta is loaded with bony matter; and the Pericardium appears to have been generally adherent. 4th Green Insp. Book, page 7. Case of Jas, Taylor. 1394 Ulceration of the internal Membrane of the Heart: very doubtful. 1395 Remarkably small Heart, with adherent Coagula, of considerable size, in both Auricles. The Coagula have a par- tially lamellar structure : whether any commencement of organization had taken place is doubtful, A disposition to the formation of similar Coagula in the Ventricles. Aorta stained with blood. 1396 Rounded bodies, forming Cysts, pro- bably Coagula, in which organization had commenced, adhering to the inner surface of the Heart, near the Auriculo-Ventricular opening.

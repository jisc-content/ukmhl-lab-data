THE HEART, AND DESCllIPTION. Reference to History. By whom presented, or whence de- rived. 1383 Heart of a Foetus, in which the Aorta arises from both Ventricles. The Pul- monary Artery is nearly obliterated. 1383^ The Pulmonary Artery and Arch of the Aorta, with the Canalis Arteriosus still open, so as to admit a bristle.

Callaway, Esq. 1385 Foramen Ovale open in the adult. The patient lived to the age of 29, stout and active.

Case of Hannah Lee, died Feb. 5, 1806. 1386 Foramen Ovale, imperfectly closed by a Cribriform Membrane: in the Adult. 1387 Heart of an Adult, in which the Fo- ramen Ovale is only closed by a Valvular Flap : the Auricles are both much distended. In the left, there is a large Coagulum, which, when re- cent, was semi-transparent: it adhered firmly to the Valvular Flap of the Fo- ramenOvale: it was obviously vascular, and admitted fine injection. The pa- tient was aged, and had nothing of the blue disease; but, some time before her death, had great oppression of chest, and Dyspnoea. â€” (See Prep". 2449.) 3d Green Irisp. Book, page 156.

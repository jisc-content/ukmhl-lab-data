OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION IV. OF PART II. There are few morbid appearances which are less adapted for illustration by means of Preparations, than those which have their seat in the Brain and Spinal Marrow. The chancres which these parts undergo from disease, are otten only cognizable by very slight deviations from the natural colour or consistence. Neither of these forms of altera- tion can be rendered permanent in a Preparation; smce the spirit, in which the part is preserved, gives a preter- natural hardness to the structure, whilst hght and other causes completely modify the colour. Those characters which, after the most favourable attempts, we may, to a certain degree, have succeeded in retaining, become, sooner or later, greatly obscured by the turbid condition of the spirit, resulting from the suspension of some of the fatty matter, of which the Medullary substance is m part composed. It is this difficulty in preserving the morbid appearances presented by the Brain and Spinal Marrow which gives so much importance and value to accurate drawings of Pathological specimens of the Brain.^ The Editor has much pleasure in announcing, that, in the Second Part of Dr. Bright's Work, which is now nearly ready for pubhcation, will be found faithful repi esentations of many of these morbid appearances : and several will pos- sess an additional and peculiar interest, as the counter- parts of some of the now-faded Preparations, contained in this Section of the Museum. It is almost needless here to remind the Student of the well-known and justly es- teemed works of Rostan and Lallemand, which contain the best descriptions which we as yet possess of the diseases of the Brain. Dr. Foville, to whose discoveries, respecting the anatomy of this organ, allusions have been made in

It would seem that, in this case, the Anchylosis has de- pended on some peculiarity in the growth and developement of the indi- vidual, and not on disease. Reference to History. By whom presented, or whence de- rived. Red Insp. Book, page 188. Case of Chas.Davies. A specimen, in which there is Anchy- losis between the Occiput and Atlas, and also between three of the Cervical Vertebrae. Calvaria, in which, at the anterior part, the inner table is much thickened, and presents numerous smooth Tube- rous Exostoses; having, at least super- ficially, the hardness and whiteness of ivory : this state of the inner table is almost confined to the Os Frontis. The patient, a female, had long been the subject of incurable lunacy : she died in the Lunatic Asylum of this Hospital. Calvaria, taken from a patient who had been affected with Tic Doloureux : it exhibits nearly the same appearance as the preceding. The inner table of the Os Frontis is much thickened by numerous Tuberous or Botryo'idal Exostoses ; and part of both Parietal Bones are in the same state. C.A.Key, Esq. 4th Green Insp.

By whom presented, or whence de- rived. 1442 Heart, affected with Pericarditis : the etTused matter similar to that in the preceding number, but more recent. An attempt at injection, with coloured size, partially and imperfectly suc- cessful. 1443 Recent acute Pericarditis. The layer of Lvmph on the Heart is intermediate J I , between the plastic and the inorga- nizable form of effusion. T. Hardy, jun. Esq. 1444 Heart, much enlarged, and thickly co- vered with coagulable effusion from Pericarditis : that nearest to the Heart appears to be almost or altogether in- susceptible of organization ; whilst the most superficial, or that which lines the cavity, is of a firmer texture, and in the form of minute Scabrous Villi. Old Museum Book, No. 149. 1445 Enlarged and thickened Heart. The Pericardium, which contained about three ounces of clear fluid, lined by a false membrane, rendered rough by papilliform projections : the Aorta presenting several patches of soft Ar- theromatous deposit, raising the in- ternal membrane. Some of the Bron- chial Glands much enlarged and tu- berculous, though the Lungs were free from such deposit. There was copious recent effusion into thePleura. The patient died of dropsy, which had to depend on disease of the Kidneys. 3d Green Insp. Book, p. 75 ; and Dr. Bright's Book, Part I. Case of W. Roddick.

OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION III. OF PART II. It would involve a needless repetition of the greater part of this Section, to point out all the interesting and impor- tant Specimens contained in it. To facilitate the inspection of the specimens of disease of the Heart, the following brief explanation of the plan adopted in their arrangement may be found of some assistance. The Preparations in the first part of the Section exhibit Mal-formations, dependent on suspension of developement; such as, Perforations through the Septa of the Auricles and Ventricles. No.1387, in which the Foramen Ovale is imperfectly closed, is addi- tionally interesting, from the presence of a large Coagulum, which, to all appearance recent, had become partially or- ganized, and adherent to the left Auricle, in which it was lodged. This case, which is unquestionably of consi- derable rarity, appears to resemble one mentioned by Bichat. 1388*, and those immediately following it, exhibit diseases of the Muscular substance of the Heart; such as preternatural thinness, thickness, and dilatation oftheParie- tes, and degeneration of structure. The specimens in which the right Ventricle is concerned, are taken before those of the left. In 1392*, the right and left cavities are transposed. 1396* presents a specimen of true Aneurism of the Heart. 1397 is an instance of Scrofulous Tubercles formed in the substance of the Ventricles, a very rare occurrence of which Laennec has only cited four or five examples. The two next specimens are equally remarkable; the one exhi- bitmg true Scirrhus; the other. Fungoid disease in the same situation. Next follow the diseases of the Valves; those

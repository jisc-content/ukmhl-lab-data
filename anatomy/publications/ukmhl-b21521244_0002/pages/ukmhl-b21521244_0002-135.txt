OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION III. OF PART H. lower portion of the interrupted or divided vessel. Dr. Parry fully demonstrated this fact, in an experiment per- formed on the Carotid Artery of a Ram. It appears, from a Work printed in Italy nearly half a century before the publication of Dr. Parry's experiment, and pointed out to the Author, several years since, by his friend Dr. Knox, that the fact alluded to had been proved in that country, by experiments made on the Carotid Artery of a Fox. As there is no reason to suppose that Dr. Parry had ever seen the Pamphlet in which this experiment is detailed, the formation of new vessels, in the cases alluded to, may be regarded as indisputably confirmed by the coincidence of two independent testimonies. The subject has since been further illustrated by Professor Mayer, of Bonn. Amongst the Veins, may be noticed specimens of oblite- rated Cava and Ihac Veins; also a specimen of obliterated Vena Port^, and several excellent Preparations of Varico- cele, made by Sir Astley Cooper. Amongst the specimens relating to'the Lymphatic Sy- stem, may be mentioned 1555% in which the superficial Absorbents of the Liver are seen greatly enlarged on the Parietes of a Cyst, which contained Hydatids : several of these vessels communicated freely, by lateral openings, with the interior of the Cyst. Similar communications have also been noticed in the Veins.

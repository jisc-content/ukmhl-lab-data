I OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION I. OF PART II. It does not appear necessary to prefix any general Remarks to this Section: but it may afford some assistance to those who have only time to take a transient and partial review of the Museum, to point out a few of the most interesting Preparations contained in the Section. As such may be mentioned, 1011 and 1012, which exhibit the Processus Dentatus so much enlarged as to have occasioned Para- lysis. A similar effect was produced by Fungoid disease of the Spine, in the patient who furnished the Preparation 1028. Several of the succeeding Preparations consist of Fractures of the Vertebrae; in all of which, where death did not almost immediately follow, disease of the Bladder was induced. 1037 is a specimen of Fungoid disease of the body of a Vertebra succeeding to accident. 1067, 1068, 1069, and 1069*, are specimens of a remarkable affection of the Bones of the Head, under which they be- come thick and spongy. Some very good cases of this kind have been described by Wadd ; but the precise nature of the affection does not appear to be understood. 1070 is a complete Anchylosis of the Lower Jaw, in- duced by accident. A similar Preparation, occasioned by Rheumatism, is preserved in the Museum at Leyden, and has been described by Sandifort. 1114, a specimen of Fracture of the Neck of the Hume- rus, with dislocation of the Head of the Bone, is very interesting, from the circumstance of its having been known to have produced symptoms which are considered as indicative of Fracture of the Neck of the Scapula.

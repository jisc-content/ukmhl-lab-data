The Heart of a sinus and an appendix. Into the upper part of the sinus, behind and to the right side, the superior cava pours its contents in such a manner that the blood, descending from it, falls against the opening into the right ventricle. In the fcetus this stream passes in front of, and does not blend with, the wave of pure blood which is entering the auricle by the inferior cava and leaving it by the foramen ovale. Interior of right heart: 1, Sup. cava. 2, Inf. cava, with hepatic veins. 3, Septum and fossa, 4, Pulmonary valve. 5, Tricuspid valve. 6, Pulmonary art. 7, Ductus art. 10, Left appendix. 11, Left ventricle. The inferior vena cava opens into the lowest part of the auricle, sending its blood upwards and inwards against the inter-auricular wall, for this was the direction which it took in foetal life, passing- through the foramen ovale under the protection of the Eustachian valve. This valve is a reduplication of the auricular lining, and is attached by its convex border at the front of the inferior cava and just behind the auriculo-ventricular opening. The fossa ovalis is on the inter-auricular septum, and marks the position of the foramen ovale by which, in the foetus, the pure blood

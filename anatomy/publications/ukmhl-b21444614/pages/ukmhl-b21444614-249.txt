Phlebotomy 237 the apex of the space, the head of the humerus may be obscurely felt. The axillary line is the plumb-line descending, from the middle of the first rib, between the axillary folds. In a deep inspiration the chest-wall in front of it moves forwards whilst that behind it moves backwards. Superficial veins.â€”The anterior ulnar vein comes from the little finger and the palm of the hand, and, receiving tributaries in its course, is joined in the upper part of the forearm by the posterior ulnar vein, which begins on the back of the little finger as the vena salvatella. The common ulnar vein which is thus formed is soon joined by the inner division of the median vein to form the basilic. The radial vein comes from the back of the hand (where it has large anastomotic arches with the posterior ulnar) and from the thumb ; at the elbow it is joined by the outer division of the median vein to form the cephalic. Front of right elbow. (Gray.) The median vein ascends from the palm of the hand, and just before it reaches the bend of the elbow it receives the communicating vein, which brings blood from the venae comites of the radial and ulnar arteries. It then divides into two short trunks, the outer of which joins the radial to form the cephalic, whilst the inner flows into the common ulnar vein to form the basilic. These short trunks are called from their connections median-cephalic and median-basilic respectively. Thus, the veins at the bend of the elbow are arranged in the form of the letter M, with all the points prolonged. The median-basilic is the vessel at the elbow which is generally chosen for phlebotomy, for the simple reason that it is usually larger than the median cephalic. It has this disadvantage, however, that just beneath it runs the brachial artery ; but, as the bicipital fascia

The Larynx 128 of the arytenoid. These muscles rotate the anterior angle of the arytaenoids inwards, and thus approximate the cords. The thyro-aryteenoid runs along the outer side of the true vocal cord, being attached to the retiring angle of the thyroid, and to the an- terior surface of the arytasnoid. Contracting, it shortens and slackens the cord ; it is the antagonist of the crico-thyroid. The arytaenoideus consists of bundles of striated fibres passing from the back of one arytasnoid cartilage to the other. Its action is to tilt the arytaenoid cartilages together and so to close the hinder part of the glottis. It derives its motor filaments both from the superior and the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus. All the muscles of the interior of the larynx can act together as a sort of sphjncter; and so it happens .that when the epiglottis is destroyed by ulceration the patient can swallow without being choked. He is safest, however, when bending his head well down and sucking up the food by a tube, when it is taken to the oesophagus in the zealous grasp of the constrictors. Laryngismus stridulus (Kapvyyifa, shout; strideo, hiss) is a spasmodic affection of the muscles of the cords in infancy ; it is also called laryngeal asthma, and is often associated with spasmodic contractions in the hands and feet. It is the result of some central nervous irritation, and may he caused by indigestible food disturbing the pneumogastric filaments in the stomach. Spasmodic asthma in the adult may be caused by the pressure of aneurysmal or malignant tumours upon the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The spasm generally yields as carbonic acid poisoning comes on, but it may have to be treated with chloroform inhalations, or, in the adult, by opening the windpipe. The mucous membrane of the larynx is continuous with that of the pharynx and of the trachea. It is covered with columnar ciliated Glottis dilated. (Holden.)

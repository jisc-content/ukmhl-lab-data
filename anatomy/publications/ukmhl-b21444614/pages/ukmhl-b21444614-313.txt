Dilatation of Surface Veins 301 thus, when a tumour of the liver blocks the inferior vena cava, some of the blood from below finds its way into the intercostal, axillary, and subclavian veins. In hepatic congestion also, and especially in cir- rhosis, the portal vein may be greatly relieved by the anastomosis of veins at the back of the liver with those of the abdominal wall. Occasionally in cirrhosis the superficial epigastric and mammary veins are enormously dilated. Right nipple Dilatation of super- ficial epigastric and internal mammary veins due to ob- struction of vena cava. (From a photograph. Dr. Suckling.) Umbilicus Of the superficial lymphatics, those from above the level of the navel enter the glands of the armpit, and those from below it pass to the glands of the groin. Some of the lymphatics of the abdominal walls are in correspondence with the lumbar and pelvic series, and some pass to glands in the anterior mediastinum. The cutaneous nerves are from the terminations of the lower inter- costals, from the anterior divisions of the lower lateral cutaneous branches, and from the ilio-hypogastric of the firstl umbar nerve. In the case of pressure upon the parent trunks of these nerves, pain is referred to their terminal filaments ; thus pain along the front of the belly is a common symptom of spinal caries (p. 210). One or two of these nerves may be implicated in inflammation—perineuritis — when there is pain in the area supplied by them, and after a time a series of vesicles may appear in the course of the nerve, the result of impaired nutrition.

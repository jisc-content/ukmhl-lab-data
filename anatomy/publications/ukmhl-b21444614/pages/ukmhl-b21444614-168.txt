The Thorax 156 Its branches arc : the comes nei nal intercostal muscle to the sternum vi phrenici, to the diaphragm ; mediastinal ; pericardial; ster- nal ; anterior intercostal, two to each of the six upper spaces, to anastomose with the aortic inter- costals, and many perforating branches which pass through the pectoralis major for the breast and the integument. The musculophrenic, the outer of the terminal divisions, slopes behind the sternal ends of the lower spaces, under cover of the diaphragm (which it sup- plies), and gives off anterior intercostals, like those described above. The inner division, the supe- rior epigastric^ passes through the xiphoid gap in the diaphragm (p. 152) to enter the rectus ab- dominis, in which it descends to anastomose with the deep epigastric of the external iliac. A twig or two from it enter the falciform ligament to anasto- mose with branches of the hepa- tic artery. The internal mammary veins end in the innominate veins. Ligation of the internal mammary in its continuity may be required when an oblique wound, such as a stab, implicates the trunk behind a costal carti- lage, so that the surgeon cannot secure it at the bleeding spot. It may be reached by making a two-inch incision from the side of the sternum through the middle of one of the higher spaces. The skin, fascia?, and pectoralis major having been traversed, the aponeurosis is seen which continues the exter- , Then comes the internal inter-

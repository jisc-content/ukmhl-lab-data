298 The Abdomen remnant of the gateway of the placental vessels. As the aorta bifurcates at the left of the fourth vertebra, the origin of the two common iliac arteries is represented by a spot about one and a-half inches below and slightly to the left of the umbilicus ; thence to the middle of Poupart's ligament the line of the common and external iliac arteries can be chalked upon the surface ; the first two inches of the line belong to the common, the rest to the external iliac artery. In compression of the aorta the viscera should be empty and the trunk flexed, so as to slacken the abdominal wall; pressure is made immediately below and to the left of the umbilicus. Higher than this compression is less serviceable, as the ribs hold off the abdominal wall from the spine. Moreover, at the higher level important viscera lie in front of the aorta, and these might be damaged by the force needed to arrest the circulation. Umbilical hernia.â€”In early development the abdomen is wide open in front, the lateral walls coming forward subsequently to join along the median line. The part last closed in is at the umbilicus, and this gap may persist after birth, the viscera being there covered only by integument and peritoneum. A piece of bowel escaping by the side of the hypogastric arteries may be accidentally tied or cut with the navel-string. A bulky cord should, therefore, be carefully dealt with, lest a loop of intestine be wounded and a faecal fistula result ; it should be first emptied of bowel and then tied close to the abdominal wall.

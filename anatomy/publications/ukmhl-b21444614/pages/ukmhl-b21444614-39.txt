27 External Carotid Artery The veins must be gently drawn upwards or downwards, but if any of them be absolutely in the way they must be tied in two places and cut. The artery is then denuded, and the needle is passed from without inwards, so that there may be no risk of wounding the sheath of the internal carotid and jugular vein. If it be only the lowest part of the artery which is exposed, the surgeon must be careful not to tie the internal in mistake, for the two vessels lie side by side. If he can see them both, he remembers that Digastric region. (Holden.) the external is anterior and becomes superficial to the internal; one of them gives off branches ; it is, of course, the external. If the hypoglossal nerve be seen touching one of the trunks it must be the external carotid, for, at the level at which the nerve crosses, the internal is too deeply placed for the nerve to touch it. Lastly, the surgeon should see that compression of the artery, which he takes to be the external carotid, arrests the temporal pulse. If he seek the artery above the crossing of the digastric, he must

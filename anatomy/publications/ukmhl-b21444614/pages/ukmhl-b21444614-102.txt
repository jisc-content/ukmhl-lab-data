The Eye go muscce volitantes. In the foetus a slender canal through the vitreous transmits a branch of the arteria centralis retinae to the lens, iris, and pupillary membrane. The canal of Schiemm is a narrow passage running all around the eye-ball in the substance of the sclerotic, close to the attachments of the cornea and iris. It is lined with endothelium, and, like the anterior chamber, with which it is continuous, is part of the lymphatic c, cornea ; cs, conjunctiva ; Ch, choroid ; R, retina; v, vitreous , le, ligamentumpec- tinatum ; s, sclerotic ; A, aqueous ; afi, posterior chamber of aqueous ; s v, canal of Schiemm; ir, iris; io, cut fibres of sphincter of pupil; /, lens ; c, capsule ; cir, ciliary muscle ; cip, ciliary pro- cesses ; o, ora serrata ; h, hyaloid mem- brane.

Its office is to drain away the nutrient fluid which the ciliary processes supply for the vitreous, and which enters the posterior chamber of the aqueous by permeating the suspensory ligament of the lens ; and, in addition, to carry off the tide of the aqueous, which, coining also from the ciliary processes, leaks into the anterior chamber between the lens and the free border of the irisâ€”that is, through the pupil. These aqueous tides flow into the canal of Schiemm through the

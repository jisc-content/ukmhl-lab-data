22 The Bones of the Head genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, and also by the external pterygoid. It is elevated by the masseter, temporal and internal pterygoid ; advanced by the pterygoids and the superficial part of the masseter ; and re- tracted by the deep part of that muscle and the temporal. The pterygoids im- part the lateral move- ments. Relations of the articulation exter- nally are skin, fascia?, and some of the pa- rotid gland, but the movements of the condyle are readily followed from the ex- terior. Behind are the external auditory meatus, some of the parotid gland, and the external carotid and its terminal divisions. Close above and behind are the tympanum and the internal ear. Permanent closure of the jaws may demand resection of the condyle ; this is accomplished by making an incision along the lower border of the zygoma, beginning over and through the posterior border of the masseter, and continuing it back to the tragus. The raspatory then thrusts down the branches of the facial nerve, part of the parotid gland, and other tissues which hide the condyle ; the neck of the condyle is then cut with a fine saw and drawn out with some of the insertion of the external pterygoid, and perhaps with the i nte r- art i cular fibro-cartilage. THE ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK The common carotid artery springs on the right side from the division of the innominate, but on the left side it ascends from the transverse part of the arch of the aorta. Up to the level of the sterno-clavicular joint the left artery has exceptional relations, but from this point to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where the common carotids divide, the relations are similar on the two sides. The thoracic portion of the left carotid springs from the transverse aorta, between the innominate artery and the left sub-

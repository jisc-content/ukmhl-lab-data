231 Vertebral Artery as the second or third trunk of the aorta, and reaches the scalenus by winding behind the trachea and oesophagus. Sometimes the artery passes in front of the scalenus anticus, and sometimes the vein passes behind the muscle. Compression of tne subclavian may be effected by the surgeon standing behind the patient, gripping the shoulder with his fingers, and thrusting the thumb towards the first rib, down the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, the shoulder and clavicle having been first drawn down. In certain cases it may be expedient to compress the artery by the aseptic finger introduced through an incision in the deep fascia. Collateral circulation after ligation of the third part is carried on by the service of the empty branches of the axillary artery. Thus, the superior thoracic, acromial thoracic, the long and the alar tho- racic branches, and the ending of the subscapular bring blood from the supe- rior intercostals, and from intercostal branches of the aorta and internal mam- mary. The dorsalis scap- ulae would help by its anas- tomosis with the supra- and posterior scapular arteries, and the acromial thoracic and the posterior circumflex by their com- munications with the supra-scapular in the acro- mial region. The branches oi the first part are the vertebral, in- ternal mammary, and thy- roid axis ; from the second part comes the superior intercostal. The vertebral, arising from the upper and back part of the first portion, makes a short ascent into the transverse process of the Sixth cervical vertebra ; Inoculations Â°f subclavian artery. (Holden.) it then passes through the transverse processes above this, and, taking a peculiarly twisted course near the posterior ring of the atlas, enters

Dislocation on to Pubes the shortening is evidently not muchâ€”an inch or less ; the inversion and flexion are also less, so that now the axis of the knee is only just above the opposite one, the ball of the great toe is scarcely raised, and the great trochanter is but little advanced towards the front of the iliac crest, though still it is above Nelaton's line. The head of the femur lies above the tendon of the obturator internas in the high backward dislocation,but below it in the luxation into the notch. In either case, however, the muscle and ten- don may be lacer- ated. If, as the bone travels upwards from the rent in the lower part of capsule, it do not rupture the ob- turator internus, the head may glide upon its pelvic or upon its gluteal surface. If by the latter route, it will rest in the notch, for the tendon over the front of the neck prevents its further ascent, but if it slip in front of the tendon it will reach the dorsum ilii. Dislocation on to the pubes is rare. The head of femur is thrust up to the inner side and in front of the Y ligament, and under the iliacus and psoas, causing the common femoral vessels to be much advanced and per- haps arresting their circulation. The anterior crural nerve also is stretched. The head is raised about half an inch, and as it is advanced the great trochanter is rolled back and the limb is everted. Thus are presented two of the Congenital displacement of femora. (Bkoduukst.)

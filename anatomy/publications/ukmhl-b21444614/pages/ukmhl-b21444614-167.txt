Internal Mammary Artery 155 pierce the pericardium. It receives most of the right intercostal veins, and, from the left side, the smaller azygos (v. p. 185). When the inferior cava is blocked, as by an hepatic cancer, venous blood from the lower part of the body finds a free collateral return to the heart through the vena azygos major, which may thus become as large as the thumb. Thymus gland in a child of six months. (Satpey.) 1 and 2, Right and left lobes; 4, lung; C, thyroid ; 7 and 8, inf. thyroid veins; 9, com. car. art. ; 10, int. jug. vein ; n, vagus. The internal mammary artery, from the first part of the sub- clavian (p. 228), enters the thorax behind the first costal cartilage, and, descending behind the intercostal spaces, about A-inch from the border of the sternum, divides behind the seventh cartilage into the musculo- phrenic and superior epigastric. At first the artery lies behind the subclavian vein and in front of the pleura, being crossed obliquely by the phrenic nerve ; but, lower down, the triangularis sterni separates it from the pleura.

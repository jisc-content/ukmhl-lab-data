Branches of Subclavian Artery 234 The internal mammary is described on p. 155, and the superior intercostal on p. 157. The subclavian vein, the continuation of the axillary, begins at the outer border of the first rib, and joins with the internal jugular behind the sterno-clavicular articulation to form the innominate ; the two innominates eventually join to form the superior vena cava, as shown in the illustration on p. 185. Chief relations.â€”The vein lies below and in front of the third part of the subclavian artery, and behind the subclavius muscle and the clavicle. It passes in front of the phrenic nerve and the scalenus anticus, and over the apex of the pleura. Its tributaries are the external and anterior (p. 35) jugulars. The wall of the vein adheres closely to the fascial sheath by which it is invested, and, indirectly, to the clavicle and costo-coracoid mem- brane, the vessel being expanded when the shoulder is brought forwards. ' Hence care should be taken in operations about the root of the neck or the shoulder in order to avoid the danger of air being drawn into the circulation by movements of the limb.' (Quain.) If this contingency should arise, the wound should be filled with water whilst the opening in the vein is being sought.

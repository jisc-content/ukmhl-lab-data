48 The Eiicephalojt Above, the ascending parietal convolution inclines backwards and ends in the superior parietal lobule, which is continuous on the mesial surface of the hemisphere with the quadrate lobule—which is just behind the para-central lobule (p. 53). That part of the parietal lobe which is above the end of the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure is the supra-marginal lobule, and that which is just behind the ending is the angular lobule. The former is covered by the parietal eminence. The occipital lobe rests on the tentorium and is indistinctly mapped into three horizontal lobules, called first, second, and third. This lobe is continued into the parietal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes by four small annectant convolutions. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe lies in the middle fossa of the base of the skull. It is limited above by the Sylvian fissure, and is mapped The Motor Area, after Gowers. into first, second, and third convolutions (numbered from above down- wards) by two antero-posterior fissures, the upper of which lies a little below, and parallel with the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure. Hence the upper furrow is called the parallel fissure. The motor area comprises the hinder part of the three frontal convolutions, the convolutions bounding the fissure of Rolando, viz., ascending frontal and ascending parietal; the continuation of the latter into the superior parietal lobule ; and that part of the marginal convolution which lies in front of the quadrate lobe—the para-central lobe. This last-named lobe is formed where the ascending frontal and parietal lobes blend above to prevent the fissure of Rolando entering the longitudinal fissure. The whole of this area is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (p. 42). That part of the frontal lobe which lies in front of the coronal

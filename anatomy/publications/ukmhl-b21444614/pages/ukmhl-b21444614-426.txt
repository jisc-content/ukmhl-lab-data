4H The Prostate The prostatic plexus of veins empties on either side into the internal iliac vein. The arteries of the prostate come from the internal iliac, inferior vesical, internal pudic, and inferior hemorrhoidal. An irregular in- ternal pudic artery may run by the side of the prostate (p. 442). The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. The lymphatics enter the chain of glands along the internal iliac artery. Middle lobe.â€”At the upper and back part of the prostate, between the lateral lobes, may be found a small, rounded lobe, ' intimately con- nected with the other two, and fitting in between them and the bladder and the adjacent part of the urethra. When prominent it corresponds to the elevation in the urinary bladder, called the uvula' (Quain). A slight enlargement of the ' middle lobe' upwards may cause serious obstruction at the neck of the bladder, and will give increased length to the urethra ; nevertheless, if the rest of the prostate be not hyper- trophied, a digital exploration by the rectum may give no information of the condition, the growth being into the bladder rather than towards the rectum. In most cases, however, hypertrophy of the prostatic tissue is general, and can readily be esti- mated per anum. If the enlargement be extreme, the bladder is pushed upwards and forwards, the neck being increased in length. To draw off the retained urine, a long catheter with a sudden curve is needed.

Enlargement of the prostate obstructs micturition, and necessitates the subject of it learning the art of drawing off the residual urine by a catheter. Sometimes the patient stimulates the bladder to contract by sitting upon a cold seat. Some-

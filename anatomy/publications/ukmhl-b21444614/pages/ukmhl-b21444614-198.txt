Innominate Veins (p. 157). They pass out horizontally over the front of the external inter- costal muscle, and behind the pleura. As the ribs slope downwards the arteries soon reach the upper part of the space, where they run between the intercostal muscles in the costal groove, the nerve being below, and the vein above, the artery. Each intercostal artery gives off a collateral branch, which courses along the lower border of the space. In front the arteries anastomose with the internal mammary (p. 156). They also anastomose with the superior intercostal and with branches of the axillary, and with the epigastric and lumbar arteries, and, at the back of the space, with the bronchial arteries. Each intercostal artery gives off a dorsal branch, and, in the female, the third, fourth, and fifth send out branches to the mamma. Section through bottom of fourth dorsal vertebra. I, n, in, tv, ribs; i, trachea ; 2, oesopha- gus ; 3, superior cava ; 4 is placed between first and third parts of aortic arch. (Braune.) The left innominate vein, 3 in., is formed behind the inner end of the clavicle, in front of the beginning of the left carotid, by the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins ; lying on a rather higher level than the transverse aorta, but sometimes overlap- ping it, it is very near to the upper border of the manubrium, from which it is separated by the stcrno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles and the remains of the thymus gland. The rig-ht innominate vein, I in., begins behind the end of the right clavicle, and descends by the outer side of the innominate artery ; on its right side are pleura and lung.

The Brachial Plexus 250 The reason of there being a brachial plexus is probably this : Certain muscles habitually work together. Thus, for example, the biceps, brachialis anticus, and supinator longus bend the elbow. The motor fibres for them arise together in the cervical enlargement, but anatomically it may not be convenient for the fibres to reach all of them by the musculo-cutaneous nerve ; some, therefore, are ' switched off' by the musculo-spiral. By adapting this theory to the different groups of muscles the need appears for a great primary interlacement at the root of the upper extremity. The branches given off above the clavicle are twigs to the scaleni, the levator anguli scapula?, rhomboids, longus colli, and sub- Plan of brachial plexus. (GRAY.

viii A Manual of Anatomy obtained from private sources which are duly noted, and, lastly, some have been specially prepared for me. Though the reader will not find his attention distracted by foot- notes, he will constantly meet with figures placed parenthetically in the text, thus : (p. 67). They direct him to pages whence side-lights are thrown upon the subject under consideration. It is by no means necessary that he should always use them ; but it is thought that their insertion may save him time in referring to the index, and induce him to make his knowledge of the part the more thorough. For much kind help in seeing the proofs through the press, my warm thanks are due to Mr. J. Arthur Kempe, Demonstrator of Anatomy at Queen's College, Birmingham. E. C. London : February 1890.

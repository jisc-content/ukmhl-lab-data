385 Rectum beginning of the second piece that is covered in front, for the peritoneum soon passes on to the back of the bladder, at the level of the top of the vesicular seminales, to form the recto-vesical pouch and the posterior false ligaments of the bladder. The bladder is readily punctured through the anterior wall of the rectum, between the vesiculae seminales, without damage to the peritoneum. A considerable extent of the rectum—perhaps some 3 or 4 in.— may be removed for malignant disease, especially on the posterior and postero-lateral aspect, without great risk of wounding the peritoneum. At the front the peritoneum reaches to within about 3 or 4 in. of the anus, posteriorly it does not descend so low. In excising the end of the bowel the levator ani is divided on each side, and, for obtaining more room during the operation, the wound should be prolonged to the tip of the coccyx. The rectum is then dragged down by the vulsella. The muscular coat consists of an outer layer of non-striated fibres arranged longitudinally, and of an inner one of circular fibres. The longitudinal fibres, which in the colon are found chiefly in three bands, spread evenly around the rectum in a thickish coat. Just within the anus the circular fibres are aggregated in a thick band C C

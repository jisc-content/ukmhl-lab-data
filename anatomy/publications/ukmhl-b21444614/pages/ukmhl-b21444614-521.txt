Tarsus and Metatarsus 509 The metatarsal banes have a more or less rectangular base, for articulation with the cuneiforms and the cuboid, and a rounded head for the first phalanx. The first metatarsal, like a phalanx, has its epiphysis at the proximal end. Scheme showing ossification of tarsal bones, and of first and second metatarsal bones. (Gray.) There is a vertical ridge on the inner side of the base of the first metatarsal which can be felt beneath the skin ; close behind this is the joint with the innermost cuneiform. This joint is exactly in the middle of the length of the foot, the arch of the foot being almost entirely behind it. In flat-foot (p. 502), therefore, when the arch has given way and spread out, the length of that part of the foot which is behind this joint greatly exceeds that which is in front of it. The base of the second metatarsal bone is firmly mortised amongst the cuneiforms, and articulates with the middle cuneiform, its lateral surfaces lying against the internal and external cuneiforms, a strong interosseous ligament connecting it with the inner. The third metatarsal articulates with the external cuneiform ; and the fourth and fifth articulate with the cuboid. The base of the fifth has a large tuberosity, which bulges behind the joint with the cuboid, so, to hit the joint, as in Hey's amputation, the knife must be slipped behind that tuberosity and then brought forwards and inwards. The base of each of the three outer metatarsals articulates behind by an oblique facet ; these joints have the same slant—backwards and outwards—and the innermost of them is on the level of the joint between the first metatarsal and the internal cuneiform. To draw the line of the tarso-metatarsal joints upon the un-

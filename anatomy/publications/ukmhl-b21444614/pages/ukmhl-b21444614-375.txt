363 Pelvic Fascia in the rami of the pubes and ischium, until the pelvis becomes ' beaked' or ' rostrated' ; as the patient walks the acetabula arc thrust inwards. Thus, in the rickety deformity the pelvis is flattened from before back- wards, and in that of osteo-malacia from side to side, the aperture being tri-radiate. The pelvis is also deformed when the bend of a lateral lumbar curvature is continued into the sacrum. The sacral vertebras are rotated, and are diminished in the concavity of the lateral curve ; and the sacro-iliac joint is apt to be synostosed, the pelvis being tilted and rendered obliquely ovate. The pelvic fascia consists of various sheets which are all more or less continuous with each other, but, because its arrangement is usually studied in its various parts, the student often fails to understand it in its general design and arrangement. The design of the fascia is to steady and strengthen the pelvic viscera, and to shut the ischio-rectal fossa out from the general cavity. The fascia lines the .circumference of the pelvis, from the pubes in front to the sacrum behind, in one continuous layer, passing behind the internal iliac arteries, but in front of the sacral plexus. From the back of the pubes it descends to the prostate and neck of bladder, constituting the pubo-prostatic ligament; it also en- closes the prostate and joins the back of the triangular liga- ment. Passing from the side of the pelvis, the fascia slopes down over the upper surface of the levator ani to form the true lateral ligaments of the bladder, continuous, of course, with the pubo-prostatic ligaments. Just behind the bladder it encloses the seminal vesicles and joins with the piece of the opposite side in front of the rectum. A little further back, but still over the levator-ani, it loses itself upon

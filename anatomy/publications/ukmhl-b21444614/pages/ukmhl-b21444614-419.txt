Male Bladder 407 sides and summit are intestinal coils. The base of the bladder is fixed, and is close in front of the rectum. For further remarks upon the relative position of the bladder and rectum reference may be made to p. 385. The bladder may be emptied by manual compression in those cases in which retention is due to paralysis, provided there is no inflamma- tion or other disease of the bladder, and no urethral obstruction. Structure.—A partial serous coat.—The peritoneum passes from the middle of the front of the rectum on to the back of the bladder, just above the vesicuke seminales and the entrance of the ureters ; Arrows showing rectal and supra-pubic puncture of distended bladder. (Holden.) thence it ascends over the postero-lateral surface, and, reaching the hypogastric arteries and the urachus, is reflected on to the abdominal wall. When the bladder is empty the recto-vesical pouch may come within two inches of the anus, but when it is distended the pouch stands at about four inches from the perineum. Thus, the base of the bladder, the antero-lateral aspects, and the whole front surface are destitute of serous investment, and puncture for the relief of retention may be practised through the rectum (between the vesiculse seminales) and above the pubes without risk of setting up peritonitis. At the latter situation the instrument should be thrust boldly back-

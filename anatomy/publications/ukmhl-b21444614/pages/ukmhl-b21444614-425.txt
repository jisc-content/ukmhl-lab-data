413 Relations of Prostate IbTtyw), surrounding its neck. It is shaped like the ace.of hearts, the apex pointing against the triangular ligament. It is about the size of a horse-chestnut, and consists of two lateral lobes and an intermediate portion. The urethra runs through it, but nearer to the upper sur- face. Additional relations are these :—The pubic symphysis lies above and in front. Behind, in addition to the bladder, are the vesicular seminales and the vasa deferentia. Close below and behind is the rectum, through which the index finger can define much of its outline. Below it is the thick mass of the perineum. (See fig. on p. 385.) I, pubes; 5, pubo-prostatic ligament; 9, middle lobe of, 10, prostate ; 12, left vas ; 13, left vesicula ; 14, com. ejaculatory duct; 16, prostatic plexus receiving 17, dorsal vein ot penis ; 19, bulb ; 20, Cowper's gland. Investments.—A fibrous capsule immediately surrounds the pro- static tissue, and sends processes into its substance, being, indeed, part of the gland. On the outside of this is a plexus of veins, which is in communication with the veins of the bladder and rectum (vesico- prostatic plexus) ; and at the front the plexus receives the dorsal vein of the penis. This large venous plexus separates the fascial invest- ment of the prostate from the fibrous coat of the gland. The veins are often dilated, and occasionally contain calcareous matter ; they are divided in lateral lithotomy, and then, in the adult, may be the source of serious bleeding.

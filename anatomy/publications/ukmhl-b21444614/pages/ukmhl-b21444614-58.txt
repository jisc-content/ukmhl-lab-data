46 The Enceplialon In operating, the trephine must not be applied at a lower level, lest the lateral sinus be opened (p. 39). The fissure of Sylvius runs backwards and upwards between the frontal and the temporo-sphenoidal lobes. As the frontal lobe rests upon the roof of the orbit, the fissure must start from just below the level of the roof; it begins about 1^ in. behind the external angular process of the frontal bone, and runs to the parietal eminence—not quite to its centre, for that is occupied by the siipra-margmal gyrus, which takes its name from being ' above the end' of the fissure. The main fissure runs for about | in. before it divides into its vertical and horizontal limbs ; the former ascends for about 1 in., and the latter runs backwards and upwards through about the middle of the hemisphere. The ■parieto-occipital fissure begins in the interior of the longi- T Aj- L O B ET / Outer Surface of Left Hemisphere. (Gray.)

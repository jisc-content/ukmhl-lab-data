465 Fracture of Femur by the long splint, nor must any attempt be made to repress the upper fragment by pad or bandage, lest a sharp end work through the muscles, fascia?, and skin, and the fracture be rendered compound. It may be dealt with, however, by keeping the patient in a slightly sitting posture, so that, by flexing the trunk and pelvis on the femur, the psoas and allied muscles may be relaxed to the utmost; the knee Double inclined plane ; the thigh piece Fracture of upper end of femur; limb ar- may be lengthened at A. ranged on double inclined plane. being flexed over a well-padded double inclined plane. Bending the knee takes the strain off the hamstring muscles, and raises the lower fragment of the femur to the level of the upper. Separation of the great trochanter may occur from muscular or direct violence, but the fragment quickly becomes fixed again if the limb be kept in absolute rest, the loose piece being steadied by a bandage. The accident is apt to happen to the athlete whose femur is not yet ossified throughout. The Hip-Joint The articular surfaces of the acetabulum and the head of the femur are encrusted with a layer of permanent cartilage, which disappears in chronic rheumatic arthritis. The dry surfaces of bone then become worn by friction, the acetabulum becomes loose and shallow, and the head of the femur flattened and worm-eaten. Or there may be a great deposit of new, hard bone, which takes a beautiful polish from the constant dry rubbing in the joint, so that it looks like porcelain. H H

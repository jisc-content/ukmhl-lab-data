The Pelvis 366 The fcetal head is measured by the obstetrician in the occipitofrontal diameter, ab, in the occipito-mental, om, in the cervico-bregmatic, tt, and in the fronto-mental diameter, bm. The fronto-mental measure- ment is small in the foetus, because the jaw presents no teeth and the ramus hardly exists. f Skull at birth, showing lateral fontanellcs : a b, occipitofrontal dia- meter. o ;Â«, occipito-mental. b m, fronto-mental. t t, cervico-bregmatic. The measurements of these diameters are thus given : a b, 4^ in., 07n, 5 in., //, 3! in., bm, 3} in. of the male fcetal head. Bregma (fipcypa) means the ' top of the head' ; in Latin the word is sinciput {semi, caput). In parturition the long diameter of the head enters the superior plane in the transverse diameter ; passing through the middle plane, it occupies the oblique diameter, and it emerges through the inferior plane antero-posteriorly, the occiput under the pubic arch and the face to the coccyx. Thus in its progress through each plane the long diameter of the head occupies the longest pelvic diameter. The adjacent sketch shows the head escaping through the outlet, its long

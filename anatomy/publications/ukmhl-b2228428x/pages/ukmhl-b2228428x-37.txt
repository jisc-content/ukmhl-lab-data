IV. ON THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE NERVES OF THE ORBIT. FROM THE MONTHLT JOUBNAL OS MEDICAL SCIENCE, 1852. Although it may be said that we are now pretty intimately acquainted with the functions of these nerves, there are, not- withstanding, points about each class which are either not fully understood, or not generally agreed upon. Such are,—the rela- tion between the motor nerves at their origin, and the meaning of their singular distribution amonai; the muscles of the orbit as connected with the movements of the eyeballs,—the relation which the fifth pah' bears to the motor nerves and the muscles of the eye, and the influence whicli it exerts over the parts sub- servient to the function of the proper nerve of vision,'—^^the nature of certain supposed varieties in the connections of the ciliary ganglion,—and also the remarkable influence which the sympathetic in the neck appears to exert on the eyeball and on the actions of tlie iris. In now proceeding with this inquiry, I shaU bring to bear upon it the results of a large number of dis- sections I have made with a special view to the elucidation of the above points; which, together with the careful consideration I have given to what has been written on the subject, may enable me to speak with some confidence when considering the views of others.

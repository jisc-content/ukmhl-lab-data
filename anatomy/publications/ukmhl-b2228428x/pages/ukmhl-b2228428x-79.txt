AND THE FCETAL HEART. 69 as far as l-16tli of an inch above it; and, when the valve is lifted or floated up, it is more than sufficient to cover over the foramen ovale. We see, then, that as early as the middle period of uterine life, this valve, or obturator membrane, is so fully formed as to be capable of shutting up the foramen completely. At birth it is floated up by the reversed current, and applied against the back of the foramen; and, becoming imited or glued to it, the septum auricularum is completed. We can understand, then, how an imperfect development of this valve will give rise to the condition of open foramen ovale, as there is no other means by which the communication between the auricles can be closed; and if in any case we find this valve so undeveloped that, on being raised, it cannot shut up the fora- men ovale, we may justly consider its non-development as a suffi- cient reason for the foramen ovale being open. This imperfect condition of the valve may be attributed either to its simple non-development, as the growth of this, as well as of various other parts, may be withheld without any apparent phy- sical cause ; or it may possibly be due to obstruction at the ori- fices of the right ventricle. Were the latter condition to exist, thus rendermg impossible the closing of the foramen ovale at birth, although its valve had been well formed, analogy woidd lead us to expect that the valve should present a thin and reticular appearance, like an ordinary wasting Eustachian valve, rather than appear simply small and undeveloped; but were the pulmo- nary orifice to become malformed or contracted during the two first montlis of foetal life, before the time for the development ox the valve had arrived, this might possibly influence the non- development of the valv6, besides causing all the other appear- ances which the heart presented in the case I have related to-day. However, whilst contracted pulmonary orifice is undoubtedly a fi-equent concomitant, and, it may be, precedent, of open foramen ovale, it is at the same time by no means invariably or necessarily so. In examining cases of open foramen ovale, I would suggest that care be taken to examine especially into these two pointT:â€” 1. Whether there is contraction of the pulmonary or tricuspid

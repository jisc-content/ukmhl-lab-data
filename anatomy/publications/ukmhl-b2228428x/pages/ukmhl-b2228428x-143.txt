XIT. ON BRANCHES FROM THE FIFTH NERVE TO THE MUSCLES OF THE EYE. In some animals I have found the muscles of the eye to be regu- larly supplied with distinct filaments from the sensory or gan- glionic portion of the fifth pair of nerves, in addition to their ordinaiy supply from the motor nerves. These filaments may readily be found in a careful dissection of the orbit of the sheep, according to the following description, which shortly embraces the result of much labour in making minute dissections of these parts. The superior rectus usually receives two separate filaments, one on its orbital surface from the supra-orbital nerve, and another on its ocular surface, entering the muscle some distance in front of the point of entrance of its motor filaments from the upper division of the third nerve. But both of these may not be found in the same dissection. The internal rectus receives two filaments from the nasal branch of the fifth nerve, which enter on its orbital surface. The external rectus receives one or two small filaments from the lachrymal nerve, also entering on the orbital aspect of the muscle. The retractor muscle is pierced by a fila- ment or filaments from the fifth nerve, arising in the sphenoidal fissure, and associated with the long ciliary nerves. These fila- ments to be seen in various animals piercing the retractor muscle, may be in part traced on to the eye as long ciliary nerves, but, at the same time, they branch, and at least partly end in the muscle. . Filaments from the fifth nerve do not pass dh^ectly to the oblique muscles, but they join the motor nerves near the muscles. The superior oblique may be supplied directly by a filament from' the branch of the fifth which lies to the inner side of the roof of the orbit, but this filament usually joins the fourth nerve as the latter is about to enter the muscle, or it may partly join

ON THE FASCIA OF SCARPA. 233 This fascia belongs altogether to the abdominal region of the groin; it does not exist in the femoral region; but begins im- mediately below Poupart's ligament, as a prolongation upwards from the fascia lata, as a thin aponeurotic membrane, as broad as the groin itself, and about an inch in depth as.a separate membrane, from its attached margin, or origin, obliquely up- wards to where it becomes united with the common superficial fascia. The error of some, in describing this fascia as passing down- wards into the femoral region, forming a deeper layer of super- ficial fiiscia there and also the cribriform fascia, has no doubt arisen from the circumstance that the true origin of the fascia, from the fascia lata, is divided with the knife, under the impres- sion that it is only an adhesion of the fascia to Poupart's liga- ment which is being divided; but if this be divided, the fascia of Scarpa is destroyed. For some inches below Poupart's ligament, no doubt there is the appearance as if the common superficial fascia consisted of two layers, separated by the femoral glands and superficial vessels ; a thicker and superficial, containing more or less fat; and, behind and between the glands, laminated cellular tissue as a deeper layer. But these are not separate fascias; they both belong to the common superficial fascia, are both cel- lular in their nature, and quite continuous with each other, except at the points where a gland or vein necessarily separates them in making a bed for itself. It is therefore unnecessaiy and erroneous, to describe the superficial fascia below Pou- part's ligament as consisting of two separate layers or separate fasclfe. It is also incorrect to describe the fascia of Scarpa as passing over the saphenous opening and there forming the cribriform fascia; first, because this fascia stops, or rather begins, close, as close as possible, below Poupart's ligament; and secondly, because the cribriform fascia is a diflPerent structure, the correct under- standing of which is bound up with a correct understanding of the nature of the saphenous opening. The cribriform fascia is simply a thin covering to the saphenous opening, and limited to this; prolonged from the outer edge of

xy. ON THE ABNORMAL ANATOMY OF THE ARM. [From the British and Foreign Medico-Chiburqicai. Keview, 1864.] A CONSIDERABLE number of varieties in the anatomy of the brachial region have fallen under my notice in the dissecting room, and some of these are so rare and interesting that I have thought it worth while to draw up a systematic account of them, and especially to call the attention of anatomists to the occurrence of the supra-condyloid process on the humerus of man. I shall arrange my cases and remarks under three heads— varieties of the muscles — the supra-condyloid process — and varieties of the arteries. I.—VARIETIES OF THE MUSCLES IN RELATION TO THE AXILLARY AND BRACHIAL ARTERIES. 1. The Axillary Artery Crossed by a Muscular Band. It is noticed by several anatomists that, occasionally, a slip of muscle is prolonged from the latissimus dorsi, across the axilla, to join the tendon of the pectoralis major, the coraco-brachialis, or the fascia over the biceps. This variety has occurred in eight out of 105 subjects dissected in my rooms since the first instance was N

13 IN MAN AND VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. permit of their advancing the eye, which is probably accom- pHshed by the resilience of the soft parts, against which it has been drawn by the action of the suspensory muscle. It has also been held, that one use, at least of the oblique muscles, is to compress the eye laterally, so as—by rendering the cornea more convex, and by increasing the distance of the lens from the retina—to fit the eye for the vision of near objects. But, as this could be only a secondary use of these muscles, it may be observed, that, although both eyes usually converge equally when near objects are viewed, the effect would be liable to be produced unequally, and at times when it was not re- quired. Again, it has been supposed that the oblique muscles might act so as to turn the cornea inwards. It is not easy to see how, singly or combined, they could perform a rotatory movement of this nature, as this would require them to be attached consider- ably before the centre of the eye, and the internal rectus does not appear to stand more in need of assistance than any of its fellows. This opinion, however, has been brought by some to explain why the power of turning the eye inwards may remain after the internal rectus is divided, or believed to be so, in the operation for convergent sti-abismus; whilst others explain the same circumstance by supposing that the inner fibres of the upper and lower recti can act so as to invert the eye. Even those who believe that the power of turning the eye inwards may not be destroyed by division of the internal rectus, will admit that such is at least not usually the case, from which it may be in- ferred, that there is no muscle, or combination of muscles, by which inversion of the eye can be naturally performed after the internal rectus is divided; otherwise there is no reason why the power of inversion should not always remain. This I have never yet observed in any case where I felt satisfied that the muscle was wholly divided. When, any power of inversion re- mains, I regard it as indicating the necessity of searching for some part of the muscle which has escaped division, and I have not yet found it necessary to divide any other muscle, in whole or in part, in addition to the internal rectus, for the complete

MALFORMATION OP THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. 77 directly from the pulmonary artery. In the ahove case, however, both of these conditions are combined. Had the malformation been confined to the blood-vessels alone, interesting inferences might have been drawn, with regard to the foetal circulation. There was no communication between the ascending and descending aortas; and this corresponds to the view commonly entertained, that the purer blood of the ascending aorta is distributed by th^ vessels which arise from the arch, whilst the descending aorta is filled with the less pui'e blood from the pulmonary arteiy. Again, it will be observed that the two superior extremities were supplied with blood from different sources, which, in the normal state of the heart, would have been of different qualities, whilst in no respect was there any difference in degree of development between the superior extremities. The additional complication, however, of such a large aperture be- tween the ventricles, must have established complete admixture of the blood of the two sides of the heart, before it was sent into the aorta and pulmonary artery, so that, independent of subse- quent abnormalities of the vessels, all parts of the body would be supphed with blood of the same quality.

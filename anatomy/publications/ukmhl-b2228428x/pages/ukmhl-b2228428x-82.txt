72 ON OPEN FORAMEN OVALE. in Avliich the valve shuts up the opening at birth) at the ujyper part of the fossa ovahs a recess, which occasionally pi-esents a small unclosed passage admitting a probe or even a quill. Of this I have brought a preparation, now before the Society, where a common quill readily passes through a very oblique passage, and along with it is seen a corded condition in front of the oval fossa, and an extremely reticular condition of an old Eustachian valve; and there is in my museum a preparation, taken from a female aged sixty, in which the aperture is twice this size ; also the Eustachian valve is lai'ge and strong. It is commonly re- marked, that this condition can allow of no admixture on account 'of the obliquity of the passage. But, whilst I am aware that obliquity of perforation is pi'oductive of a very perfect valvular effect, as in the case of the termination of the ureters and bile duct, the circumstances are reversed here. The force which shuts the oblique passage—the passive flow of the pulmonary blood into the left auricle—is not stronger than, and is not so direct as, the force which tends to open it—viz., the current of the lower cava; and as the direction of this is exactly in the direction of the slit, it seems to me that there cannot but be, during each diastole, a small quantity of venous blood sent into the left auricle. This, however, can be only to a very trifling extent, and would not, perhaps, be worthy of notice, were it not for the sake of fully reasoning out the effect of the various condi- tions of open foramen ovale.

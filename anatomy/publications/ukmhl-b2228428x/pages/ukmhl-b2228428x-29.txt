III. TWO CASES OF DOUBLE STOMACH IN MAN; WITH OBSERYATIONS OJf THAT COroiTIOK FROM THE MONTHLY JOCRNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, FBBE0A.BT 1861. On opening the abdominal cavity of a middle-aged female sub- ject, at lecture during tbe winter session 1847-48, my attention was attracted by an unusual appearance of the stomach. It seemed contracted in the middle, and on distension it became evident that the stomach consisted of two sacs, connected to- gether by a narrow communication. The woodcut. Fig. 1, will convey a better idea of its form than could be done by detailed description. The communicating passage is just large enough to allow the forefinger to psiss with ease, and the length of the constricted portion is about half an inch. On turning the stomach inside out, the mucous membrane is seen to be smoothly continuous from one cavity to the other; and, whether in the collapsed or distended state, there is no appearance of a valvular fold or thickening of the coats in the contracted part, or where it opens into either sac. The left division is fully one-third more capa- cious than the other, and forms a large cul-de-sac projecting in front of the oesophagus, which enters towards the upper and back part. In the sketch, which presents an anterior view, the left division is represented as twisted forwards, so as to show the place of entrance of the oesophagus, the lower part of which is

CASE OF MALFORMATION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE F(ETUS: PULMONARY ARTERY GIVING OFF DESCENDING AORTA AND LEFT SUBCLAVIAN. By DAVID GREIG, M.D., DEMONSTRATOB OF ANiTOMT IN THE UNIVEBSITT OF EDINBURGH. FBOM THE MONTHLY JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, JULY 1852. During the summer of 1850> having procured a foetus, which seemed to be about the ninth month, and wliic-h, on external ex- amination, presented nothing pecuHar with regard to form, colour, etc., I injected it from the umbilical vein. On examining the chest, I found the following arrangement of its blood-vessels :â€” The ascending aorta is small, passes straight up, and, after a course of about three-quarters of an iiich, terminates in three branches of eqlial size, which are the right subclavian, and the right and left common carotid arteries.

The case oi iginally foi'nied part of the prize essay on the Fcctal Circu- lation, Session 1850-51, in my class, in which Mr Greig was a distinjjuished student. The preparation is preserved in my museum.

XIIT. ON DIVERTICULA FROM THE SMALL INTESTINE, ANATOMICALLY AND PATHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED. [From the Edinburgh Medical and Surgicai, Journal, April 1854.] Having met with a considerable number of instances of the diverticulum from the small intestine, and with several in which it was concerned in producing death, I have thought it might interest others were I to record the facts with which my investi- gation of this subject has made me acquainted. It is well known to anatomists that, as a rare variety, a diver- ticulum or csecal appendage may be found projecting from the small intestine; and various opinions have been expressed re- garding the origin or nature of this process. My object in this paper is chiefly to state anatomical and pathological facts in connection with the cases I have met with, but it is well that I should first briefly glance at the different views, so as to elicit the bearing of the details to be furnished. Monro^ has observed, "There are two kinds of diverticula, original malformations, and those formed consequent upon the protrusion of the intestines. The preternatural appendices occa- sionally found within the sac of a hernia are generally formed as stated by my grandfather, viz., by the gradual elongation of the â€¢ The Morbid Anatomy of the GuUet, Stomach, and Intestines.

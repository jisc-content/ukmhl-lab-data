ON THE NERVES OF THE ORBIT. 57 outwards, the harmony is the same, and the central influence guides and. controls alike in both cases. We ai-e not, therefore, to conclude that it is only when the sixth and fourth nerves, and non-corresponding muscles, are employed, that, this influence is needed or exerted. Still, when we look to those movements where non-corresponding muscles are employed, we observe that^ on one side a separate nerve is provided for the muscle. But we see no reason why this should be so, beyond the inference we draw from noticing the fact that it is so; nor are we to suppose that this explains why one eye follows the other in an opposite movement; we merely observe the facts together, and we there- fore conclude that the design contained in the provision of separate nerves, the sixth and fourth, for the external rectus and superior oblique muscles, is explained, so far as it can be, by the circum- stance, that one of these nerves is used on one side, when the movements are non-corresponding or in opposite directions; and it is, in connection with this, also remarkable, as before stated, that while the third or common nerve arises as near to its distri- bution as possible, the origins of these two single nerves are so remote and separate. As regards the nature of the movements of the eyeballs, by which the direction of the axes is changed, we observe that they are all perfectly voluntary,â€”that is, we can, when we wish, look with both eyes in any direction we choose, only the will is so subjected to the central regulating influence, that the two eyes are obliged to move conjointly, so as to preserve the con- vergence of the axes. But it is a very common belief, that there is likewise an involuntary movement of the eyes in the upward direction. This was maintained more especially by Sir Charles Bell, who describes the ej-eballs as being turned involuntarily upwards in the act of winking, during forcible expiratory efforts, in sleep, fainting, and the insensibility preceding death. Plis theory as to the use of this motion in winking was, that the cornea is turned up in order that the mucus and impurities brought down by the hd miglit not be left across the cornea after being collected in the little triangular gutter, which was formerly supposed to remain between the margins of the closed lids and

172 ON VARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY operation of tying the third portion of the axillary artery, which may be done with ease and safety, where it lies in front of the conjoined tendon. Another blameable omission is, the absence, in the description of the hand, of all allusion to the thecce, or fibro-osseous canals, with their synovial linings, for the flexor tendons. The tendons are briefly noticed with the muscles of the forearm, but without any allusion to the thecÂ« or to the synovial lining and nutrient vinculae within the canals; and with the ligaments of the hand, there is but a short notice of them, without any reference to their surgical anatomy. It is surely within the province of surgical anatomy to point out that these canals shut in the tendons along the fingers; that the incision for the relief of tension, or evacua- tion of matter, in whitlow, must be deep enough to lay this canal more or less open, without which the incision will be of no use; that an incision made longitudinally, and in the centre, will effect this purpose, and avoid the blood-vessels and nerves, whilst one made across, or obliquely, would divide the vessels and nerves, and, if it went deep enough, the tendons also, besides in- sufficiently opening the canal. If anatomists do not point out the reason for it, the student is not unlikely afterwards to forget the sm-gical direction as to incision here, for want of the free practice of which so many fingers are lostj or remain stiff" after the loss of the flexor tendons. Errors are made in the description of the passage of the ten- dons beneath the posterior annular ligament of the wrist. As our Edinburgh students know very well, this ligament is like a bridge with six unequal arches, each, without any variation, transmit- ting its tendon or tendons, with their synovial linings; and they could tell our author, as well as we can, that the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and extensor indicis lie in the same groove and canal, not in separate ones; and that the extensor minimi digiti Hes, not in a groove on the ulna with the extensor carpi ulnaris, but in a canal of its own, without contact with either bone. In the description of the thorax, we happened to observe that no notice is taken of the dilatation of the last part of the great

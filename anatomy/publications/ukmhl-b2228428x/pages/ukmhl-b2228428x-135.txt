AND THEIR RELATION TO THE VERTEBRiE. 125 cesses, is not, with perhaps rare and partial exceptions, developed in man from a separate centre, but of " exogenous" formation, as it is termed by some. The position of the little twelfth rib, in my second case, illus- trates very clearly the analogy between the ribs and the trans- verse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. It shows an intermediate link between a twelfth rib and a transverse process, or rather, it is like a lumbar transverse process, a little longer and narrower than usual, articulated but not ossified to the vertebra, and much like what we should expect in the case of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra not becoming ossified to the pedicle, when it had been, as it is known occasionally to be, developed from a separate centre. Also, the analogy between the tubercle on the root of the superior articulating processes of the lumbar vertebrae and the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae is very apparent in this specimen. In no case almost has the twelfth dorsal vertebra a distinctly projecting transverse process, but here there is only a tubercle, or little elevation, deeper ver- tically, but scarcely more projecting than the tubercle on the first lumbar vertebra; whilst the latter or analogical lumbar trans- verse process, holds the same relation to the transverse process usually so called, as the transverse process of a dorsal vertebra does to the commencement of a rib. In considering these analogies, we must not forget, as some writers on transcendental anatomy seem to have done, that the parts which may be so regarded, do not the less serve a specific purpose, and to serve which they are provided. The lumbar transverse processes and tubercles are required to give attachment to certain muscles in the loins, and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae are constructed with a view to several pur- poses ; chiefly to form a foramen for the lodgment of the verte- bral artery, which implies an anterior and posterior arch during growth, and, in the four common vertebrfe, a couple of tubercles, one for the anterior and one for the posterior group of muscles, and a groove between for the safe passage of the nerve; all of which, it is not too much to say, would have been present whether any part of the process was analogous to a rib or not; that is to

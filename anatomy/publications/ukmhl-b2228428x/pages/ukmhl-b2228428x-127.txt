ON THE SEMILUNAR VALVES OF THE HEART. 117 ing to serve the purposes of nutrition, respiration, etc., altogether irrespective of motive power. But as experiments show the power of the heart to be fully sufficient, and as this great central force, modified by the influence of the nervous system in causing dilatation or contraction of the larger or smaller arteries, or of the capillaries themselves, is sufficient to explain all the phenomena of the circulation, including local determinations, it is perhaps unnecessary to invent other and hypothetical powers; and so far from a mechanical explanation being objectionable, it may be remarked that such a mode of accomplishing an object in the living body, is indeed not a lower but a higher manifestation of power and design, being a more simple means of attaining the end in view; and mechanical laws, be it recollected, come from the same Author as the vital endowments. In the whole of animal physiology there is perhaps nothing more perfect and beautiful, and at the same time more simple and mechanical, than the action of the semilunar valves; and they are kept working by the vital endowment of the living heart, and enabled to resist friction and wear by the vital endowments of the blood-vessels which nourish them. The valves open and close with force at every action of the heart. Allowing the heart to act 75 times in a minute, this will give us 4500 actions of these valves in an hour; and although not thicker than very thin writing paper, these valves, thus acting incessantly through every hour of a long life, may be found as good at the end of it as at the beginning.

ON THE SEMILUNAR VALVES OF THE HEART. 113 which prevent the valves being washed up altogether flat against the wall of the artery; the cavities of the valves are thus quickly and inevitably filled, and the valves are quickly and forcibly thrown down towards the ventricle against each other, completely closing the orifice, and producing the second sound of the heart. It may be, that during life, a few drops of blood get back into the ventricles before the complete closure of the valves can be efiected, but we observe in the dead body, when the valves have not been diseased or altered from age, that the action of the aortic valves is complete, as shown by the injection of the arteries. In injecting our subjects from the femoral artery, the injection passes up the aorta and down the arch, and is arrested at the orifice of the aorta by the semilunar valves. If it is a diseased or old subject these give way, or, without actually tear- ing, allow the injection to enter the left ventricle; but if the subject is young or a healthy adult, the arrestment is complete, and not a drop of the injection is seen in the ventricle. We would expect that a few drops would pass through the centre before the valves could be filled out and thrown down, but again we must recollect that the valves in the dead body lie loosely against or towards each other, in the absence of any force to keep them up, and are therefore perhaps more in the way of being immediately closed, than in the living body, in which they have to return from the position into which they had been washed by the blood rushing out of the ventricles. The action of these valves is pex-fectly mechanical, and con- trasts with that of the auriculo-ventricular valves, to the perfect action of which vital contractility is necessary, in the employment of the musculi papillares. The principle upon which these papillary muscles are used, is, it seems to me, simply that of shortening of their tendons—the cordse tendinese—so as to ac- commodate these to the size of the cavity of the ventricle, the contraction of which during the systole would otherwise relax the cords too much and allow the flaps of the valves to yield too far. I do not, however, deny that the musculi papillares may act first of all, pulling the flaps towards each other so as to make sure of the blood getting behind them, thus serving the purpose H

IL ON THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES OF THE EYE, m MAN MD YERTEBRATE ANIMALS. FBOM THE MONTHLf JODBNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, OCTOBEB 1849. Nearly ninety years ago it was remarked by Porterfield, that " though the action of these two obhque muscles seems pretty evident, yet there is scarce any part of the human body about which anatomists have differed more than in assigning them their proper oflBces:" and the observation is still appropiiate, although the subject has since engaged the attention of various anatomists. The question does not admit of being decided by experiments on the lower animals, chiefly because mammals are provided with an additional muscle, or series of muscles, for retracting or sus- pending the eye, which are beyond the reach of trustworthy ex- periment, and to which motions of the eyeball might be owing after the straight muscles had been divided. Accordingly, the opinions of most authors on this matter are founded upon a con- sideration of the manner in which it appeared to them that these muscles, from their direction and attachments, would influence the ball of the eye, so as to change the direction of its axis; and very different conclusions have been arrived at by the most emi- nent anatomists. A necessary preliminary to such an inquiry, is a correct under- standing as to the manner in which the eyeball actually moves. It appears to me that all the movements of the human eyeball are purely rotatory in their nature, as if it moved within a close-

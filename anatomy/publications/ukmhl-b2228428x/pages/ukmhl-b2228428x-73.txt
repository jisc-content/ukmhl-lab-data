V. CASE OF OPEN FORAMEN OVALE, AND CONTRACTED PULMONARY ORIFICE; WITH OBSEBVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE FOETAL HEART. [Read to the Edikbcrgh Phisiological Societt, 13th March 1852; and ex- tracted from the Monthly Journal op Medical Science, July 1852.] This heart is from a child aged fifteen months. It presents,— 1. An open foramen ovale; 2. A large Eustachian valve; 3. Great contraction of the pulmonary orifice; and 4. Contraction and hypertrophy of the right ventricle, with narrowing of the tricuspid valve. The foramen ovale admits the little finger,—i.e., is equal in size to a circular opening of the diameter of half an inch. Its valve is imperfectly developed, thick, and muscular-looldng. It does not reach to the upper margin of the foramen, although its horns on each side reach higher than the oj)ening. The Eustachian valve is very large and loose, much more so than at any period of foetal lifer It measures nearly an inch (7-8 ths) from its attached to its free horder ; and when lifted up- wards, it reaches for one-third of its depth ahove the upper mar- gin of the foramen ovale. It is cribriform, especially at the right half of its attachment, and also above, near its free margin. Right ventricle.—The walls are 3-16ths of an inch in thick- ness, whilst those of the left are from 3-16ths to 4-16ths. In ad-

ON VAKIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY 170 are so, that the appearance of the second book is altogether un- called for. But, as it may not be fair to condemn a book merely because the title is inappropriate, or the plan which the author has set for himself may not meet our approval, we shall now proceed to notice how the author has acquitted himself in the execution of his plan. On this score there should be little room for comment. In a student's manual, treating of matters of fact, wdiich have long been familiarly known, and compiled by one who, even be- fore writing the first edition, has had the " experience of seven years, engaged in the active duties of the practical teacher in the dissecting-room," the descriptions could scarcely fail to be correct, and suited to meet the difficulties which the student feels in his progress. Taken by themselves, many of the descriptions and hints for assisting the memory are good enough; and most of the illustrations are useful, well designed, and certainly almost all of them well executed by the artist; so that, indeed, the book might be recommended to the student as a good and useful one, were it not that we already possess several which are much superior to it, both in plan and execution. But, while we think the descriptions well executed according to the plan of the work, we at the same time can by no means give to them our unquahfied approval. There are not a few errors in point of anatomical fact there is frequently a want of precision, and not a few omissions, unpardonable in any text- book, but more especially in one professing to treat of sui-gical anatomy. We shall now notice a few of these, in the order in which we have happened to meet with them, and make such comments as may serve to fui-nish some information, as well as to point out the deficiencies of this treatise. INTEEIOB ExTREMiTT.-On page 8 there is a diagram of the thigh, of which we observe first, that the saphenous opening is placed too far inwards, as, when it is dissected, the outer edge of the opening corresponds usually to either the middle or the inner edge of the femoral arteiy; and secondly, that the apex ot

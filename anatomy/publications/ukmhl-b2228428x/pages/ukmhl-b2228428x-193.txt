183 CONSIDERED IN A REVIEW. fleeted serous membrane, as Mr Dalrymple believed it to be when, in 1834, he wrote his book on the anatomy of the eye; but Dr Jacob, although originally he may have used the term serous, is careful to explain, writing in 1839, that it is not a serous membrane, part of his words beingâ€”" I have above stated my reasons for considering it a single layer, and not a double serous membrane ;" and as the nature or minute structure of the membrane is now well known, and bears out Dr Jacob's descrip- tion, it is hardly fair to assign to him, a living man in 1853, the antiquated opinion of another, which he had written to correct fifteen years before. The retina is described, after Treviranus, as presenting minute papillae on its internal surface, and oui' author would therefore seem to be unacquainted with the microscopical researches of Hannover and Bowman. The capsule of the lens is mentioned without any reference to the important fact that it is several times thicker in front than behind; and the old error, that it " contains a small quantity of fluid, called liquor Morgagni,'"_ is reproduced, although followed by the remark that " Dr Jacob is of opinion that the lens is con- nected to its capsule by means of cellular tissue, and that the liquor Morgagni is the result of cadaveric change," p. 378. Now Dr Jacob not only expressed his belief, but clearly demonstrated the fact, that there is a strong adhesion between the lens and its capsule, that there is no fluid here in a recent eye, and that it is incorrect to attribute to Morgagni the deliberate belief that there is fluid here in the living healthy eye. That the capsule of the lens should allow a fluid to pass in after death, but exclude it during life, is not more wonderful than that the same capsule should so easily become opaque during life, but resist all means to make it so after death; or that the cornea should not absorb and swell out with the aqueous humour during life, as with water after death; the difterence lying in the possession or loss of vita- lity ; but whatever the explanation may be of the formation of the fluid which may always be seen to escape on puncturing the capsule of an eye not recent, especially if it has lain a day in water, it does not alter the fact, which we had thought every

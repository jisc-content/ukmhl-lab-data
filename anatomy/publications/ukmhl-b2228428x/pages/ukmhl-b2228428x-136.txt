126 ON RUDIMENTARY RIBS say, the anterior part of the cervical transverse process does not exist from necessity, merely, so to speak, from the force of any general law or type of formation, as the "costal appendage" of the vertebra, but exists there because it is required or impUed in the formation of a hole, which aperture again is formed here, like apertures elsewhere, because required for a purpose. It is, however, at the same time, most interesting to observe that this purpose is effected by the working out of a general plan; and here, as frequently elsewhere in anatomy, we see several prin- ciples combined or ends sei-ved by one and the same means. It would indeed be wonderful if the skeletons of the various verter brata were not all laid down on the same general plan ; but would it not be more so, if this plan could not be varied or departed from when it was necessary or better that it should be so,—the variation being the specific law, while the other is the general law, and both equally original and fixed V These remarks apply to those " analogies" of the human skeleton which are constant, and where the parts at the same time serve specific purposes, which we must distinguish from those occurring occasionally only, and to which the term " anomaly" is applied,—a term to which there can be no objection, if we understand the sense in which it is used. Of these we have examples in the occurrence of true supernumerary ribs, or still better, in the hooked process that occasionally springs from the humerus above the internal condyle, and is the analogue of the arch of bone completing the foramen in many of the mammalia, through which the median nerve and brachial artery pass. These anomalies serve no specific purpose, nor do they interfere with the specific uses of any other parts, and of such deviations we can give no explanation beyond obsex'ving the fact and tracing the analogy. To speak of such anomalies as the result of a ge- neral law and type of formation, or a " law of deformation," is at best an assumption, or a use of terms without any intelligible 1 I have here, in the common language of descriptive anatomy, used the terms— Rib Transverse Process—Body, etc. Those desirous of linowing the terms pro- posed as substitutes for these, in accordance witli the views of Owen and others, may consult Mr Holmes Coote's short Treatise on "The Homologies of the Human Skeleton."

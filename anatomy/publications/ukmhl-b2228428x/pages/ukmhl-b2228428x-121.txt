ON THE SEMILUNAR YALVES OF THE HEARTt lit be explained by the supposed greater activity of the right side of the heart before birth, as the foot is that, at least during the latter two-thirds of foetal life, the walls of the left ventricle are already considerably thicker than those of the right. We must distinguish, in using the term " malformation," be- tween malformation owing to disease in utero, and to original deviation. The latter only can be regarded by the anatomist as cases of variety in the number of the valves, and there is little evidence to show that such a condition has occurred. If the two, or four, valves were of equal size, healthy, and in all respects corresponding to each other, then only could we conclude the case to be one of original variety. The suitable number of valves for orifices of this size and activity appears to be three. Where valves occur in the trunks of the larger veins, two is the usual number—three being rarely found in man ; but, in the larger animals, it is stated that three occur not unfrequently. When the vessel becomes large, and especially here, where so much strength is required, it seems that three valves become necessary. Two large valves, each occupy- ing a half of the large orifice, would be less easily or completely pushed aside by the blood than the three; and, when in action, the strain would have told more upon them than it does upou the thi-ee, which are so doubled against each other, when closed, that each fits into an angle between the other two, and exerts its pressure against the walls of both of the others in this angular recess. On the other hand, a greater number than three would give complexity, without additional openness to the passage, or security against regurgitation ; as, whatever the number, each would still require to be at least projecting enough to meet the others in the centre of the orifice, besides an addi- tional portion to be doubled up against the others. At the same time, that two valves might be sufficient, is evi- dent from the cases in which, although more or less diseased, they were found when death had been due to other causes • and in these cases their diseased or irregular condition might be re- garded either as affording evidence, on the one hand, that the condition of two or four valves had its origin in disease ; or on

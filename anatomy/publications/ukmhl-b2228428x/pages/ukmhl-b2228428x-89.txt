VII. ANATOMICAL INQUIRY INTO THE MODE OF ACTION OF LOCAL BLOOD-LETTIXG IN AFFECTIONS OF THE INTERNAL VISCERA. [Read before the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society, February 17,186 and extracted from the Monthlt Journal of Medical Science, April 1853.] My object in the following observations is, to inquire into the mode in which local blood-letting can be of service in affections of the internal viscera. The practice generally followed in this country is, to apply leeches or to cup over the affected part, whether in the trunk or limbs; and it will be generally admitted- that this is done with the view of affording special relief to the affected part, by the more or less direct withdrawal of blood from its distended blood- vessels,â€”that is to say, in following this practice it is generally believed that the blood-letting is a local, and not a general, one. Before proceeding with this inquiry, I shall assume two points as the groundwork of my argument. 1. That the relief in local blood-letting is through the blood-vessels or vascular system, and not through nervous agency; and 2. That, as blood can come from one part to another only by blood-vessels, there can be no special relief by local blood-letting, unless the blood-vessels of the one communicate or anastomose with the blood-vessels of the other. It is evident, therefore, that this inquiry must be founded on a

MODE or ACTION OF LOCAL BLOOD-LETTING. Â« i We observe that here also there is a serous cavity between the wall and the contained viscus. The parts internal to this cavity are supplied by the internal carotid and vertebral arteries; whilst those outside, viz., the dura mater, the skull, and the ex- ternal parts, are supplied by the external carotid. Now the ar- teries of the brain and pia mater do not communicate with those outside the arachnoid cavity, but it is different with the veins, I do not here refer to any minute anastomosis between the peri- osteum on the outside, and the dura mater, or internal periosteum, on the inside, whilst the latter at the same time lodges the re- turning veins from the brain; nor to the venous canals in the diploe, for these chiefly open internally; but I refer to the direct communications, by^means of what we term the emissary veins, which occupy the parietal and mastoid foramina. By these veins the longitudinal and lateral sinuses may directly empty themselves into the veins of the scalp. This is more especially the case with the mastoid communication, which may be looked upon as a kind of safety opening by which the lateral sinus may be relieved; and this sinus, it will be recollected, receives the entire blood from the brain, and also from the orbit. There is another communication between the veins of the scalp and the cranial sinuses, by means of the ophthalmic vein, which externally connnunicates freely with the veins of the eye- brow and temple, and internally joins the caveriious sinus; but to afford internal relief by this communication, the natural direc- tion of the current in the ophthalmic vein would require to be reversed, which probably could not be effected by anything less than a fi'ee opening in the angular vein. It would appear, then, from anatomy, that, by leeching the scalp, especially behind the ear, the sinuses of the diira mater and veins of the brain may be relieved, and that as directly, though not so rapidly, as by the method of opening the external jugnilar vein at the root of the neck. The common practice of cupping on the back of the neck, with the view of specially relieving the brain or head, is no doubt ge- nerally, or in great part, efficacious, simply as a slow or mild general blood-letting; but is at the same time not without anato-

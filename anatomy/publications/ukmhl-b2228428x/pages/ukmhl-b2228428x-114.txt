104 PARALYSIS OF THE COMMON MOTOR OCULI NERVE. Action of Belladonna on the Iris in Paralysis of the Hiird Nerve.â€”I may also mention an interesting physiological obser- vation which I made in the coiurse of the treatment of this case, viz., that the paralysis of the third nerve, involving the iris, does not interfere with the usual action of belladonna in causing dila- tation of the pupil. On two occasions the pupil, on the paralysed side, was well dilated before half an hour after the application of the atropine, and after two or three days began to retui'n to its former size. On a third occasion both pupils dilated equally, and returned nearly equally to the former size. I have since repeated this observation on another case. Within a quarter of an hour of my applying the atropine, the pupil was undergoing its usual active dilatation. This adds additional evidence to the view that the third nerve regulates only the contraction of the pupil, whilst its dilatation is accomplished through another nervous agency which we possess the power of calling into activity by the influence of the belladonna.

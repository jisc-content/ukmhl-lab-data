IN MAN AND VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 15 subject of discussion previous to that time, some having denied the existence of such a movement, as they could neither perceive its xitihty nor observe its occurrence. It was brought forward in 1786 by John Plunter, in a short paper on the use of the obhque muscles, among his observations on some parts of the animal oeconomy, in which he has endeavoured to explain the circumstances under which such a movement is necessary; and the same view is attributed to Dr Jacob, of Dublin, in the last edition of Quain's Anatomy.^ The view of Hunter is well ad- vocated by Dr G. Johnson, in the article " Orbit" in the Cyclo- pgedia of Anatomy and Physiology; and he adduces in support of it the result of experiments performed by him on a newly killed dog, from which it appeared that the contraction of the oblique muscles caused the eye to roll on its axis in opposite directions, without causing, in the slightest degree, any of the movements by which the direction of the axis is changed. The physiological uses of such a movement are not at first sight very apparent. In those lateral motions of the head, which take place between atlas and the axis, the eyes, in being kept fixed on an object previously viewed, are moved later- ally by the recti muscles; but, as Hunter explains, when it is moved laterally, as from shoulder to shoulder, rotatory motion of the eyes, on their antero-posterior axes, is also required, to prevent the picture from changing its place circularly on the re- tina. Thus, when the head is bent dovra towards the right shoulder, the right superior and the left inferior oblique will be in action. It is evident, under such circiunstances, when the head is twisted round on an axis more or less corresponding to that of the eye or eyesâ€”that the latter must be rotated more or > Since the above appeared in the Journal, I have been favoured with a copy of Dr Jacob's very instructive paper "On Paralytic, Neuralg-ic, and other Nervous Dis- eases of the Eye," from the Dublin Evening Press, for January 6, 1841 on which I had been unable to lay my hands in Edinburgh. In support of his opinion that the function of the oblique muscles is to turn the eye on its antero-posterior axis Dr Jacob relates cases in which the action of the superior oblique was rendered' an parent, from the muscles supplied by the third and sixth nerves being paralysed It became evident when the patients were directed to look downwards, the motion b'einir a dehcate rotatory one, the eye being distinctly twisted on its axis. Dr Jacob also takes the same view as to the purely rotatory nature of the various movements of

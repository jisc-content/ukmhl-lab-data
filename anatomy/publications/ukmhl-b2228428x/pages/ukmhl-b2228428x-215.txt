205 THE SUPRA-CONDTLOID PROCESS. chief trunk deviates and passes round process. Nerves not preserved. 11. Leftside. Nothing known of right. Young child. 12. Left side. Nothing known of right. Nearly full grown arm. This, and the last, also in Dr Barclay's collection. In both, process is well developed,,and in both there is the same arrangement of arteries as on left side of No. 10. 13. Eight side only. Skeleton, also in College Museum. Fe- male, and probably £et. about 30. Process moderate on right humerus, with well marked groove behind it. Left has no process and only a shallow groove. 14. Case by Tiedemann.^ Eight side. Nothing said regarding left. Process distinct. Brachial artery usual in position. High inter-osseous passes round process. Nerve not repre- sented. Process designated " an unusual excrescence from the humerus." 15. Caseby Mr Quain.2 Eight side. No information regarding left. Adult. Nerve and artery pass round process. The following generalizations may be made with regard to this process and its relation to the nerve and artery. As regards situation, length, and form.—The situation is re- markably constant. In the adult bones it is two inches above the internal condyle, measuring from the upper edge of that prominence to the middle of the base of the process. In one it was ^ inch nearer, and in one ^ inch farther from the condyle. In case No. 2 only did it lie considerably nearer the condyle, being an inch and a quarter from it, and here the process was long and of unusual breadth. The length varies from inch to f of an inch. It is seen in all stages—as a short rough line, a pointed tubercle rising from a base elongated upwards and downwards, and a hook or spur like process of greater or less length. I have never seen it longer than I of an inch. In the specimens figured it is of this length. It begins by a vertical ridge half an inch to an inch in length, » Tabulaj Arteriarum, 1822.

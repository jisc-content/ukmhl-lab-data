186 ON VARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY but loose in the sub-arachnoid spaces, secreted by the vessels of the pia mater, as the aqueous humour no doubt is by the vessels of the iris, and ciliary processes. The analogy then is rather the other way, agreeing with the fact, that no membrane can be traced lining these chambers. The JoiNTS.â€”The last chapter embraces the anatomy of the joints, and is all but a literal reprint from the author's systematic manual, and also corresponds closely to the text in the first edition. So far from disputing the propriety of introducing the joints into a manual for the dissecting room and of surgical anatomy, we are of opinion that there is no part of anatomy of greater importance to the surgeon than that of the larger joints, and perhaps there is none more neglected; but we do not think such descriptions as those with which we are here presented can serve any practical or surgical purpose. The author's views regarding the study of the joints may be gathered from the cir- cumstance that the chapter is headed, not of the articulations, but " Of the Ligaments;" and so it is with many, who seem to think that, in connection with the joints, they have only to com- mit to memoiy the names and attachments of the ligaments. Now, the study of the joints should embrace, first, a careful con- sideration of the form and adaptation of the articular surfaces, then the ligaments, then the synovial membrane, with the ex- tent and recesses of its cavity, and lastly, and of great importance, the natural motions of each joint; not merely the names of these motions, but the natui'e and direction and extent of each. In connection with the hip-joint, for instance, it is not enough to mention, as we find here, that rotation is one of its motions, but the kind of motion which rotation is, inwards and outwards, the effect it has in rolling the whole limb, and the method of moving the limb so as to perform it, as in the examination of the limb after an injury, are all points quite as worthy of notice as the fact that there is a capsular or a round ligament. Farther, we conceive the surgical anatomy of the joints to embrace the notice of the osseous prominences outside and near the joint, and the relative position of these in the different motions. AVith such a knowledge of the joints the surgeon can usually see at a glance,

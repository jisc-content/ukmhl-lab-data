XI. ON RUDIMENTARY RIBS, AND ON SOME POINTS IN THE ANATOMY OF THE VERTEBRJ). FBOM THE MONTHLY JODRNAl OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, OCTOBER 1853. I SHALL first describe the parts in two instances which have oc- curred in my anatomical rooms, in which the highest and lowest ribs were in an imperfectly formed condition; and then offer a few considerations as to the nature of the various irregularities of the ribs, and their relation to the spine. I.â€”Imperfect condition of the First Pair of Ribs, and their relation to surrounding parts. This variety occurred during summer session 1852, in a male set. 24, in all other respects well formed. There are twelve ribs on each side. The first or highest rib on both sides is short, a large part being represented by a ligament. The right is two inches in length, the left two inches and a quarter. Each joins by its head the upper part of the body of the first dorsal vertebra by one entire facet, the lower part of the body of this vertebra receiving also, as usual, part of the head of the second rib. Both articulate by their tubercles, an inch outward from the head, with the transverse process of the first dorsal'vertebra. They

CONSIDERED IN A EEVIEAV. 181 recti tendons, and " continued as far as the margin of the cornea." A very sliglit examination will satisfy any one that these tendons are inserted abruptly into the sclerotica, having become only a very little broader, but far from anything like approaching each other. Their edjies are as neat and clean cut as those of the muscles which end in them; their abrupt termination in the sclerotica is a Httle curved with the convexity towards the cornea, and about three lines ft-om it; and they dip in and are soon lost by becoming blended with the fibres of the sclerotica; but neither in it, nor over it, is there anything like a membrane formed by the expansion or union of the recti tendons. In propagating this error in modern times, our author, though by no means singular in this respect, must be held to have had a principal share. We have not only the description, but, on page 371, a diagram re- presenting the tendons joining each other, with beautifully curved edges, and forming a sheath over the front of the sclerotica; and, contrasting this with the statement in the preface to the first edi- tion, that the descriptions " have not been copied from the works of his predecessors, but have been penned from the great book of nature," we trust we have convinced our author of his fallibility, and that he shares in common with many of us the tendency to see things as others have described them, rather than as they really exist. We have equal fault to find with our axithor's statements re- garding the action of the oblique muscles, besides that he places the insertion of the superior too far back in saying that it is in- serted near the entrance of the optic nerve. But, as the action of the oblique muscles may be regarded by many as debatable ground, we shall remark only, that, whatever their actions may be, our author can give no pi'oof that they are such as he de- scribes, and that he seems to be quite unacquainted with all that has of late years been written in Dublin and in Edinburgh on this subject, all tending to establish the view of John Hunter and others, that they are provided for the purpose of rotating the eye on its antero-posterior axis. We observe a diagi-am of the nerves of the orbit (fig. 27), in which the roots of the fifth nerve are traced to before and behind

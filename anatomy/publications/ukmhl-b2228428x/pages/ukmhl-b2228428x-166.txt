156 ON DIVERTICULA FROM THE SMALL INTESTINE, monly speak of the intestine presenting two borders and two surfacesâ€”a mesenteric or attached border, and a free or convex border (although this is not a border in the proper sense of that term, in, at least, the distended bowel), commonly designated by the obscure expression of the part " opposite the mesentery," mean- ing thereby farthest from the mesenteiy. But tbe surfaces have no constant position; what is anterior at one time may become posterior at another, according as tlie convolutions change; what is the front of a convolution passing from left to right, may, by the turning over of that convolution, become posterior, and then the bowel is passing from right to left; as, it is clear, in the ar- rangement or retention of the bowels, there must be a turn to the left side for every one that exists to the right, except the last to join the cascum. Nor has the mesentery itself, except at and to- wards its root, any fixed anterior or posterior surface. It rather lies laterally, like the ribs of a partially opened fan, that surface which is anterior joined to a convolution passing from left to right, be- coming posterior on the next convolution,passing from right to left; and these, together with the convolutions, change about in regard to convexity and concavity, so that, of a sigmoid portion of bowel and mesentery, what was convex may be changed to concave. It is therefore deceptive to speak of the movable intestine hav- ing an anterior or posterior surface, and in expressing any rela- tion or attachment, as that of a diverticulum, we can only say that it was placed on the bowel nearer the mesentery on one side than on the other. Lastly, it will be observed of these diverticula, that the great majority have a more or less oblique direction from the bowel, and that the bowel on one side is larger, usually considerably larger, than on the other. Whether the larger side was the colic or gastric side in the above cases, I am unable to say with cer- tainty, but am inclined to the view that the larger was the gastric end, which would give the conclusion that the diverticulum was usually prolonged from the bowel obliquely downwards, i.e., in the direction in which the chyle or intestinal contents were mov- ing, and it is conceivable that the obHquity had been determined in^this way, although I do not propose this as more than a sug-

CONSIDERED IN A REVIEW. 187 when there is no fracture or dislocation, the natural figure of the limb and motions of the joint remaining; and when there is, he readily detects the nature of the injury. We pass this general condemnation on the whole of this chapter, on the ground of its deficiency in practical and surgical bearing, and besides, notice several unpardonable omissions. Thus, in connection with the shoulder-joint, we are left to in- fer only that the long tendon of the biceps lies above the head of the bone. There is no allusion to the fact that it passes over the ball of the humerus, like a belt, serving, when the biceps acts, to keep it from rising up against the acromion pro- cess; or that the tendon lies in a grooved recess in the capsular ligament, the anterior boundary of which is so prominent that some have considered it as analogous to the round ligament at the hip; which, however, it is not truly, even although a probe may sometimes be passed round it, free within the joint, close to its attachment to the lesser tuberosity, and just in front of the commencement of the bicipital groove. There is conse- quently no allusion to the occurrence of dislocation or rupture of this tendon in the joint or groove, of which so many cases have been brought together in Mr Callaway's treatise on the shoulder-joint (Tjondon, 1849), which we would recommend to our author's notice. Of the Up-joint it is enough to say, that not only is there no mention of the strong periosteum, with the raised fibrous bands on the neck of the thigh-bone, which may retain the fractured ends in apposition, as we have seen, but there is not even any direct mention of the pregnant fact that the neck of the thigh- bone lies within the cavity of the joint. We would suggest for insertion in future editions, the general information as to the direction of flexion and extension of the great joints of the extremities, that, in the superior extremity, flexion is forwards and extension backwards at all the joints whilst in the lower extremity, flexion and extension are alternately forwards and backwards, as at the hip, knee, ankle, and toes; from which it follows, that when a muscle crosses two joints in the upper extremity it either flexes or extends both, if in the

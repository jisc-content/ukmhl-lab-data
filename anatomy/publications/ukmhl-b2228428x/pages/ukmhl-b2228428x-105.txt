[Read before the Edinburgh Medico-Chikurgical Society ; and extracted from the Monthly Journal of Medical Science, July 1853.] I HAVE thought it worth while to give an account of this case, as I had the opportunity of observing it carefully in its various stages, and of making a complete dissection of all the parts concerned. The patient was a man aged 73. When I saw him first, on September 16, 1852, tlie following symptoms presented them- selves in connection with the left eye:â€”Tlie upper eyelid was completely fallen, and without any motion.

ON THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES OF THE EYE, 8 fitting socket, or, as it were, on an universal pivot at its centre. The axis on which the rotatory motions occur M'ill always be at right angles to the moving power—transverse when the upper and lower recti act, vertical during the action of the lateral recti, and intermediate in the diagonal movements, which are performed by the conjoint action of two neiglibouring recti muscles. Again, in the motion of circumduction, as in turning the eyes round a room, which is performed by the alternate action of the four straight muscles, the centre, as it were, still remains unmoved, one end of the axis being depressed as the other is raised, and so on. In accordance with this we find the straight muscles sweep- ing over the globe of the eye, to become inserted considerably anterior to its middle, so as to fit them for producing these various motions; by all of which, it will be observed, the direc- tion of its axis is changed. But it is held by some, that, inde- pendent of any change in the direction of its axis, the eye, under certain circumstances, undergoes a movement quite different in its nature—that of rotation on its antero-posterior axis, or what is usually called the axis of the eye,—and that it is the function of the oblique muscles to produce this movement: which I shall call lateral rotation. It appeared to me that light might be thrown on this disputed subject by the evidence which comparative anatomy would no doubt afford; fpr, although the existence of corresponding muscles has been noticed in passing, by various writers on comparative anatomy, the arrangement of them with reference to their action on the eye does not appear to have been inquired into; and, having made careful dissections of these parts, in a great variety of instances, I am enabled to furnish, from my notes, the follow- ing summary of the arrangement of the oblique muscles in the different classes of vertebrate animals,—avoiding notice of the comparative anatomy of the other muscles of the eye, as in no Avay affecting the present inquiry.

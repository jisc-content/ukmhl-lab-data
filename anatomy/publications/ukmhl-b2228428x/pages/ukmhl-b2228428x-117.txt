DESCRIPTION OF AN ESQUIMAUX FEMALE PELVIS. 107 â€”"Till witliin a few hours of labom*, the woman goes about her usual duties, and shortly before it is expected, she retires alone to a skin hut built for the purpose, which is so small as to con- fine her almost entirely to the recumbent posture. While there, no one is allowed to enter the hut, and should she require any food it is placed at the door by her friends. No one is present while labour is going on, and this is usually finished in about half an hour." " In one case which I have heard from authentic sources, the female was seized with labour pains while on board a whaling vessel. She immediately left the ship, and retired behind a hil- lock of ice, returning again with her child on her back in less than half an houi'."

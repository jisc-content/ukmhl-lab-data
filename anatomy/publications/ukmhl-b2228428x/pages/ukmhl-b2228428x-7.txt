PREFACE. This Volume was prepared for the students attending my lectures last winter Session. It consists chiefly of Papers which have already appeared at different times in the Medical Journals, to which E"otes and several Papers are now added. For the shortness of these ad- ditions I can only offer the excuse, that they were made, and the Yolume prepared, during the latter weeks of a very busy Session, during which I was occupied in lec- turing twice a-day, and superintending the dissecting- room studies of a class of four hundred students; a laborious system which custom has entailed upon the teacher of anatomy here, and which, though beneficial to the student, and although it may be held that our time cannot be more usefully occupied than in teaching,â€” leaves much less leisure than I would wish for the no less pleasing occupations of research and authorship. J. s. Edinburgh, June 12, 1854.

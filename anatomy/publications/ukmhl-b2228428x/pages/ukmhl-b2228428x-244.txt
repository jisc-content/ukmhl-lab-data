234 ON THE FASCIA OF SCARPA. the opening, and losing itself hy covering and uniting with the femoral sheath, which, on the inside, adheres to the pubic portion of the fascia lata on the pectineus muscle. The outer and upper parts of the edge of the saphenous opening do not naturally exist as defined margins, until this true prolongation from them is divided with the edge of the knife; and the cribriform fascia is, therefore, a thin prolongation of the fascia lata itself across the opening, and not a portion of the superficial fascia adhering to the opening as it crosses it. delation of the Fascia of Scaiya to the Fascia of the Perineum.— Besides those already described, the fascia of Scarpa has an- other important connection, in its continuation around the sper- matic cord, towards the perineum, where it becomes continuous Avith the true superficial fascia of that region; a connection which is usually correctly described. The fascia in the perineum is variously called the deep or true superficial fascia, the deep layer of the superficial fascia, or the superficial fascia. Amongst these various definitions the student is often at a loss to know which structure is being described, and to avoid this source of confusion and derive the advantage from the use of a short specific name, I am in the habit of calling it the fascia of Colles, as the general con- nections of this membrane, and especially the course of infiltrated urine 'determined by the fascia, appear to have been first fully described in this country by the late ]Mr Colles of DubHn, in his excellent and practical treatise on surgical anatomy; and if ana- tomists would agree to call these two fasciae the fascia of Scarpa, and the fascia of Colles, it would save much perplexity to the student. The fact is, there is only one superficial fascia in the body,—the common superficial fascia,—equally extensive with the skin, com- posed fundamentally of cellular tissue, and containing more or less or no fat according to circumstances, but whether very thin, or very thick from fat, it is still the same cellular membrane, composed of areolar or filamentous, or what is after all much better to be called by the old name of cellular tissue; and although, especially when fat is laid down in it stratum after stratum, pre- sentincv sometimes an ajjpearance of layers, it is still one fascia,

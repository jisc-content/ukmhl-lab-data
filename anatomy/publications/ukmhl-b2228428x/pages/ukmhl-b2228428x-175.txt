ON DIVERTICULA FROM THE SMALL INTESTINE. 1G5 liere is but a rare occurrence, even although, in the erect and sitting postures, the caput ccecum coli is a depending recess. However, a case of such accumulation within a diverticulum ilei is referred to in the catalogue of the Museum of the College of Sm-geons of Ireland. The preparation is thus described, vol. i. p. 38, "A diverticuluin on the human intestine. This pre- paration was taken from a young woman who died of fever ; it forms a circumscribed bag about the size of a turkey's egg, and opens into the ileum at a point about three feet from the csecum, by a passage sufficiently large to admit the end of the little finger; it is filled with hard brittle matter, apparently the solid residue of fseces stained with bile. The omentum and intestine in the neighbourhood were closely joined to the tumour by ad- hesions, the result of a former inflammatory attack ; this woman had complained for many years before death of occasional very severe pains in the abdomen." 4. In conclusion, I have to add one case in which a diver- ticulum verum ilei was the seat of disease, without any apparent cause. This is the same case as No. 17 in the notes, and fig. 17. I found it in an adult male subject, and, on inquiry, learned that the patient, previously in good health, died after a few hours' illness, with symptoms of ileus or gangrene, but that the bowels had continued to move. The diverticulum was in a state of grangrene or approaching gangrene, healthy at its origin, as was also the intestine itself, but the rest of the diverticulum was gangrenous-looking. There was no strangulation or constriction at any part, nor was any other morbid appearance found. The diverticulum was carefully examined also by eversion, but inside there was no appeaj'ance of ulceration or irregularity, and it con- tained air alone when first examined. The diverticulum was, without any ascertainable cause, simply in a state of gangrene.

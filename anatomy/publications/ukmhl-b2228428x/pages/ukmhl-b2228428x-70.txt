ON THE NERVES OP THE OEBIT. 60 natelj as direct antagonists; and also their relation to their fellows of the opposite side—tliat the superior of one side acts ■with the inferior of the other; and the remaining consideration is, what relation exists, if any, between the two classes of muscles, the straight and oblique, on the same side—whether either oblique muscle acts more with one rectus than another. First, we ob- serve, as bearing on this, that the inferior oblique is seemingly grouped in nervous supply, by the inferior division of the third nerve, with the lower and internal recti; and this might lead us to suppose that it was associated in action with these muscles more especially. This inference, however, is met by the consi- derations, that the arrangement of the motor nerves has reference more to the relative action of the muscles of opposite eyes; and that, as has been already remarked, the nerve to the inferior rectus acts as readily with the sixth nerve, as with that to the internal rectus, witli which it is associated in origin. Also, that only one of each of the two pairs of muscles which act non-correspondingly receives a separate nerve, whilst the com- mon nerve goes to all the other muscles in the orbit; and that, from the position of the muscle, it is as natural for the infe- I'ior oblique to be supplied by the division of the third nerve, Avhich goes to the lower and inner recti, as it is for the levator palpebraj to be supplied from the division which supplies the superior rectus. Apart, however, from these reflections, on con- sidering carefully which of the straight muscles will be more or less in action with each of the oblique muscles, it does not appear that there is any constant relation. It will depend very much on how far and in what way the two kinds of motion of the head are blended. The superior oblique will be in action as often with the internal rectus, and the inferior oblique as often with the ex- ternal, as with any of the other recti muscles; and it therefore does not appear that there is in the same orbit any special asso- ciation between either of the oblique muscles and one or more of the recti.

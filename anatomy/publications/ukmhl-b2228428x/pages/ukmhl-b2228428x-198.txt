188 ON VARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY lower extremity it flexes one and extends the other, except in the cases of the sartorius and gracilis muscles. We would also ventm'e to recommend to all anatomists the omission of such terras as flexors or extensors of the thigh, or flexors or extensors of the leg, and to substitute for them the ex- pressions flexors and extensors of the knee, or of Hie ankle, as the flexors and extensors of the thigh are not the flexors and exten- sors in the thigh; the use of such terms leads to confusion, but no one can mistake what is meant when we speak of the flexors or extensors of any particular joint. In connection with the knee-joint, the synovial pouches at the side of each condyle (into which a loose cartilage may be pushed and fixed by operation) are not mentioned; nor is there any mention of the prolongation of the synovial membrane earned out of the joint by the tendon of the popliteus muscle, the passing of which close to the back of the superior tibio-fibular joint, so readily explains how there can be, as there occasionally is, con- tinuity of the cavity of this joint with that of the knee, a circum- stance, which otherwise it would be difficult to account for. The bursa is described as " jjlaced between the anterior surface of the patella and the fascia lata. It is the latter which is inflamed in housemaid's knee." We have always found this bursa to be placed in the cellular tissue immediately under the skin, and to correspond to the lower part of the patella, that part of it on which we rest in kneeling, and not under the fascia lata. The facility with which swelling takes place in eff'usion into it, and with which, after suppuration, pus makes its way to the surfoce, corresponds to this superficial position of the bursa. We have, at the same time, often noticed a bursa, or apparent bursa, still deeper, and between the prolongation from tlie fascia lata and the fibrous covering of the patella; but never without a free communication with the regular sub-cutaneous bursa; and cross- ing the interior of this bursa, and also of that between the tro- chanter major and the gluteus maximus, may be often seen a series of soft fibrous bands, like cordae tendinese, giving a com- plicated appearance to the bursa. In now concluding our notice of this manual, we trust that

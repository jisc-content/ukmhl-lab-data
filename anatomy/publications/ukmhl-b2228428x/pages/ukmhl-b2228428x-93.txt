MODE OF ACTION OF LOCAL BLOOD-LETTING. 83 one, that they are the vessels concerned in affections of the bronchial membrane,—that is, the one set of vessels appear to be chiefly concerned in pneumonia, and the other in bronchitis- Now, it is evident that blood taken from the wall of the chest cannot drain or derivate from the pulmonary system of vessels, but can influence them only by acting through the general circu- lation, and that by lessening the quantity of blood to be returned to the right side of the heart and thence sent to the lungs. But it may be said, that the pulmonary vessels may be relieved by means of their, anastomosis with the bronchial vessels. As to the nature or even existence of such communications between the two sets of vessels of the lung, anatomists are not quite agreed, although the result of minute injections has led most to believe that the deeper set of the bronchial vessels, ramifying on the smaller bronchial tubes, do communicate with the pulmonary capillaries or veins. Very little weight can be attached to an explanation depending on this obscure anatomical point; but supposing, for the sake of argument, that the pulmonary veins could be drained to a slight extent by drawing blood from the bronchial veins, this again could be of no service unless these veins themselves can be locally acted on from without. Is it, then, in our power to relieve the bronchial vessels by local blood- letting ? The arteries are usually three in number,—two on the left side, which spring from the thoracic aorta, and usually one for the right side, which may arise either from the aorta, or in common with or from the first aortic intercostal artery of this side. In such an argument it is scarcely worth while to mention the occasional varieties of these arteries in their origin, nor prob- ably would physicians be disposed to explain any supposed benefit from local blood-letting by referring to the occasional or frequent origin of the right bronchial artery from one of the arteries going to the wall. The bronchial arteries, then, must be regarded as deriving their blood direct from the aorta, so that they could not be reheved either by draining or derivation in local blood-letting to the wall, this serving merely to draw off so much more blood from the general current of the aorta, exactly as in the case of the abdominal aorta in leeching the abdominal wall. Nor could

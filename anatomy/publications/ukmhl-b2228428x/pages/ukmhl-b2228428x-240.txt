230 VARIETIES OF THE ARTERIES. was emaciated, but it was not so prominent as the veins, wliich were also injected. This is probably wliat some would call a sub- cutaneous position, and it is worthy of future notice whether, in those rare cases in which the radial or ulnar arteries appear to lie over the aponeiarosis, a layer of it, binding them down, has not been removed. As regards the operation of venesection, a preliminary exa- mination of the front of the elbow should always be made, and if there is an artery pulsating very distinctly, the other arm may be taken, or the vein opened at some little distance from where the artery is felt pulsating. In the case of a high division, giving two ai'teries in the arm, I have always found each ai'tery accompanied by vense comites, giving, when the veins have been injected, a very complex ap- pearance to the vessels. Some describe one vein only as accom- panying the brachial artery, but I have always found two, with the usual cross communications. A few inches above the elbow, the basilic vein usually passes through an oblique opening in the aponeurosis, and joins, or is joined by, the internal of the two vense comites, which thereafter is so lai'ge that the other is apt to be overlooked. As a general rule, venge comites exist with all arteries in the upper extremity below the axillary, and in the inferior extremity below the popliteal.

MODE OF ACTION OF LOCAL BLOOD-LETTING. 93 that I have come to the exactly opposite conclusion,—that " the prudent and proper practice still is, to apply the treatment over the affected part." The conclusions I have dravra on anatomical grounds, which are not matters of opinion, but matters of fact, may be shortly stated thus:— 1. Local blood-lettings on the chest or abdomen are truly so, as far as the wall is concerned, but can act upon the viscera only on the principle of general blood-letting. 2. But that it is proper to continue the local practice, because the wall is often affected along with the viscus, to our certain knowledge, and we are often unable to decide whether the wall is not in whole or in part the seat of the disease. 3. And that, therefore, the physician is not at liberty to depart from the local practice, unless he could be certain that the affec- tion was Hmited to the viscus.]

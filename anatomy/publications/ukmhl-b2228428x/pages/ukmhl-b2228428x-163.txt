ON DIVERTICULA FROM THE SMALL INTESTINE. of tlie ileum is Wcanting in valvulas conniventes. It may vary in different cases, but M. Cruveilhier's statement, that " sometimes they are altogether wanting in the last two or three feet of the bowel," is, I think, incorrect, as representing them to exist too low down. My own observation would lead me to say that ge- nerally they are wanting in the lower third of the small intestine, that is for about six feet upwards from the caecum, allowing twenty feet as the average length of the small intestines. In one instance in which the small intestine was twenty-four feet in length, the lower half was entirely destitute of valvulse conni- ventes. At the commencement of the lower third, six feet from the CEecum, they are very small and scattered, or can scarcely be said to exist, and soon altogether disappear, so that (while I do not deny that sometimes they may exist nearer the caecum) at least in the last four or five feet of ileum, there are usually no valvulse conniventes ; and therefore a portion of bowel bearing a diverticulum, and free from these valvulse, or dark rings, may be safely pronounced to have been taken from within this distance from the caecum. Now this conclusion embraces all the specimens of true diver- ticulum, twenty in number, above described and figured. In one or two there were traces of valvulse, where the diverticulum oc- cuiTed, indicating that the situation was not more than five or six feet above the c^cum, whilst m all the others the intestine presented no valvulse. For this remarkable fact, that the true diverticulum occurs constantly near the caecum (whilst the false diverticula occur indiscriminately at any part of the alimentary canal, and may be one or more in number), taken in connection with its evident original natm-e and continuity with the intestine, there must be a reason ; and the view of Meckel that this explanation is af- forded by the early connection between the vitelline duct and the intestine, appears a very satisfactory one, when it is further con- sidered that the vitelline duct joins the canal at the same part where the diverticuhmi occurs, viz., at the lower part of the small intestine; and seeing that it is not a point capable of proof from actual demonstration, I am not aware of any objection that can

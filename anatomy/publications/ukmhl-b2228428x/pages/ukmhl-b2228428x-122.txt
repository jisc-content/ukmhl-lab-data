ON THE SEMILUNAR VALVES OF THE HEART. 112 the Other, if the two valves were of equal size, that they had been two in number originally, and that their consequent less perfect action had brought about the disease. Cases such as the one recorded cannot be explained farther than by the supposition of an arrest of development—that, in early life, one of the valves had ceased to grow. It is possible that a small valve had been a portion of a large diseased valve, united by adhesion to the wall of the artery, as in the case of the mode in which it is supposed the additional valve is formed when more than three are present; but, in a similar case noticed by Dr Peacock, the small thu^d valve had, still more than in this one, the appearance of being an originally separate valve, which had ceased to grow in early life. On the Natural Action of the Semilunar Valves.—When the blood in the ventricles is compressed by their systole, it meets with the convexities of the closed semilunar valves, and pushes them aside. This of itself must require considerable force, when we consider the strain backwards, especially upon the aortic valves, from the elastic reaction of the arteries, which tends to force the blood backwards upon the valves, as well as forwards. This forcible throwing aside of the semilunar valves, and driving of the greater part of the blood out of their cavities behind, must contribute to the production of the first sound of the heart fully more than the part of that sound supposed to be contributed by the mere rushing of the blood through the narrow orifices of the aorta and pulmonary artery. When we consider the matter closely, it seems as if a small quantity of blood would regurgitate into the ventricles before the valves had time to close, as the valves have been washed up, and all the blood ex- pelled from behind them, except so much as there is room for in the sinus of Valsalva, or the recess in the wall behind each valve. When the ventricles have thrown the blood forcibly up into the arteries, these are distended, and, reacting, tend to force the blood back, but the reversed current or weight of the column pressing back, meets the partially open mouths of the valves, a condition of them which is ensured by the sinus behind and the blood in it,

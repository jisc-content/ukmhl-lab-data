1 have preserved the nerves from both orbits, as dried preparations, and the above is an exact copy of those of the left side, the individual filaments being also repre- sented. 6. Sixth nerve, split at its union to (s) the sympathetic, and ending in filaments (/) to the external rectus muscle. 3. Third nerve, joined to the sixth by the communicating branch which existed on tills side. (ft) Upper division of third nerve ending in filaments to superior rectus and levator palpebrce. (6) Branches of third nerve to internal rectus. (c) Ditto to inferior rectus. (d) Ditto to inferior oblique. 5. Nasal branch of fifth nei"ve, giving long root of ganglion, and long ciliary nerves. (g) Ophthalmic or ciliary ganglion ; receiving short root from the branch of the third to the inferior oblique, and long root from nasal branch of fifth; and giving short ciliary nerves. (e) Short and long ciliary nerves, with <in anastomotic loop between two of them. On this side, seventeen ciliary nerves were dissected where they pierce the eye. The third nerve is small relatively to the sixth and nasal, as this was the paralysed side. Also the ciliary ganglion is now shrunk a little from the original size, and ap- pears smaller than that body usually is when recent and moist. Dissections of the nerves of the orbit, and especially of the ganglion and its con- nexions, may be easily preserved as dried preparations; and an instructive series may be thus conveniently put up. After being carefully removed, they are to be laid out wet and placed correctly with needles, or the point of the scalpel, on paper; and when dry, they are easily raised stifle, and gummed down on board. I have many such preparations, amongst others, one of all the nerves of the orbit, with portions of the muscles, from tlie calf, laid down in this way, showing also the fifth nerve supply- ing filaments to the muscles of the eye.

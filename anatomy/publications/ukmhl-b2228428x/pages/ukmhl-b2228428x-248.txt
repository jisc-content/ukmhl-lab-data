ON THE FASCIA 01* SCARPA, 238 andPoupart's ligament thus lie in the angle of splitting, or union of all these fescias, and the crural arch is formed by this lunc- tion." He refers to the relation of this fascia to inguinal hernia, but not to its relation to the fascia in the perineum, or to the course of the infiUrated urine, nor does he give a more ex- tended view of its connections than that stated or implied in the above quotation, which, however, shows that he Avas acquainted with its true origin from the fascia lata close below Poupart's ligament. The description I have given, embraces what I believe to be the true anatomy and surgical bearings of the fascia of Scarpa. The reason why it is by some incorrectly described, and perhaps in none of our anatomical works described clearly as having the anatomy I have endeavoured to explain, is, I believe, tliat its ori- gin, as a continuation upwards of tlie fascia lata is usually divided, either from above or from below, after which the fascia cannot be seen, that in fact this fascia is but seldom seen in dissections. But if the dissection is conducted according to the method above described, the demonstration of the fascia is very easy, and it only requires to be once seen in this way, to satisfy the dissector that this is its true anatomy. The whole anatomy of this fascia is very simple, and, together with its siai'gical bearings, may be shortly described thusâ€” The fascia of Scarpa arises from the fascia lata close below Poupart's ligament, passes upwards for an inch, and blends with the common superficial fascia. It is separated from the lower part of the tendon of the external oblique, behind, by very loose cellular tissue, and, before, from the common superficial fascia by the superficial glands and vessels; and is continued inwards around the cord, becoming continuous with the fascia of Colles or true superficial fascia of the perineum. It is a thin aponeurotic or fibrous membrane, forming a barrier or septum across the groin, by passing between the fascia lata and the common super- ficial fascia. When the urine, infiltrated in the perineum, has been directed upwards along the cord by the fascia of Colles, the fascia of Scarpa prevents it from passing down the front of the

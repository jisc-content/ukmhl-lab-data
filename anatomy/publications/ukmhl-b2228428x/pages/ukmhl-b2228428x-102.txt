92 ANATOMICAL INQUIRY INTO THE bend of the arm. All that experience can be held to have de- clared is, that a certain quantity of blood taken there is produc- tive of a certain amount of benefit; but experience has yet to declare, whether similar benefit may not be derived by drawing the same quantity of blood from some other part. The advantages that would attend this alteration .in practice in such cases would be the substitution of a more simple and less expensive procedure, as by taking the blood from a small open- ing in some vein, as for instance, on the back of the hand or foot; or, if leeching or cupping be still followed, it could be done with- out the lengthened exposure of the chest and abdomen, during which the patient is exposed to the influence of cold. I Say, therefore, with reference to the abdominal and thoracic viscera, in a case in which the practitioner feels assured that the affection is limited to the organ, it would appear that it matters not where or how he bleeds, according to circumstances he may take his choice, both of the part and the mode, feeling assured, that from whatever part he takes the blood, whether by the leech, the cupping-glass, or the lancet, he will reach the affected organ only by having withdrawn so much blood from the general cir- culation. The same line of argument, it is evident, may be pursued with regard to the other parts of local treatment in affections of the chest and abdomen, more especially to counter-mitation, only, however, in as far as this and other remedial means have their action through the blood-vessels and the cu-culation. But the farther discussion of this matter would lead me beyond my pur- pose, which was simply to demonstrate from anatomy the conclu- sions which I have already drawn. [Note. MarcJi 1854.â€”The satisfaction which I have derived from the favourable reception of the above paper at the Medic o- Chirurgical Society, and since its publication, has been lessened by finding some to be under the impression that 1 had written to prove that local blood-letting was of no use in affections of the abdomen and chest, and, consequently, that the practice of the present day was wrong. But a perusal of the paper will show

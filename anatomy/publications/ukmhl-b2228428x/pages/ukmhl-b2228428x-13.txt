L ON THE SUPRA-CONDYLOID PROCESS. FROM THE MONTHLY JODBNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, OCTOBER 1848. A FEW instances have been recorded in which the humeral artery and median nerve continued downwards in a direction towards the internal condyle, above which, in order to gain their usual position in front of the elbow, they passed around a peculiar process, there developed from the humerus, as if for the pur- pose of affording them protection. This singular arrangement has occurred comparatively so often of late in the subjects dissected in my rooms, as to induce me to call more particular attention to it, since it is one of some importance to the surgeon, and is interesting also from the analogy it presents to the usual arrangement of these parts in certain animals.^ The process, and the ligament by which the protective arch is completed, are represented by Tiedemann; ^ but, in this instance, the arteiy which passed through was not the main trunk, but a large interosseous, which had arisen high in the arm. The first description which I find of this peculiarity is by Dr Knox,^ who —after reasonably doubting the correctness of a statement, which 1 In many animals—amongst the Quadrumana, Rodentia, Edentata, Marsupialia, and more especially the Carnivora—the median nerve and humeral artery pass through an opening in the humerus, which is formed by an arched process crossing obliquely the inner surface of the bone, close above the internal condyle. 2 Tabulae Artcriarum, PI. xv. fig. 3. 1822.

ON THE FASCIA OF SCARPA. 235 the common superficial fascia, reaching from region to region as the skin does. Then we come to the deep fasciae or aponeuroses, not cellular, but fibrous membranes, thicker or thinner according to circum- stances, and serving the altogether separate purpose of binding down the muscles; and not usually, like the skin and superficial fascia, common from region to region, but with its special ana- tomy in each region, connected with its bones and binding down its muscles. Now, the fasciae of Scarpa and Colles are, in their nature, intermediate between the superficial fascia and the apo- neurosis. They are deep and fibrous membranes, aponeurotic, at theu' origin from fibrous structures or aponeui'oses, but become cellular at their other connection, as they blend with the super- ficial fascia; they pass between the deep and the superficial fasciae and partake of the nature of each as they join each. The fasciae of Scarpa and Colles form one continuous mem- brane.—The latter joins the base of the triangular ligament, or true deep fascia, of the perineum, and is also there, like the latter, continuous with the thin fibrous membi'ane or fascia on the outer surface of the levator ani muscle; at the sides, it is fixed to the rami of the ischium and pubes, and upwards from this, it is fixed to the fascia lata, keeping some distance outwards from the pubes. Here it runs directly into the fascia of Scarpa; which now forms a continuation of it, as a barrier across the gi'oin, immediately below Poupart's ligament. The origin, or fixed or deep line of attachment, of this united fascia, then, is,—the base of the trian- gular ligament, the rami of the ischium and pubes, the pubic portion of the fascia lata over near the origin of the gracilis and adductor longus muscles, and the fascia lata all the way across the groin immediately below Poupart's ligament. The posterior part—fascia of Colles—is continued forwards into the scrotum, blending with the common superficial fascia, and thus forms a pouch, closed behind in front of the anus, closed laterally at the sides of the perineum, and open forwards into scrotum and up- wards around the cord. The anterior part, or fascia of Scarpa, continues the attachment of the sides of the pouch across the groin, so that the pouch, continued up from the scrotum alouo- the

ON VARIOUS POIKTS IN ANATOMY 178 etc. This remark regarding the former danger may be a common one, but still we think the pudic artery so safe, in an operation with an oi'dinary knife making its way towards the bladder, that the incision might come close to either the tuberosity or ramus of the ischium, or even shave off a slice of the bone, without touching the artery. Even when the ischio-rectal space and the anterior part of the perineum are deeply dissected, there is con- siderable difficulty in bringing the trunk of the artery into view : it lies bound down by the obtui'ator fascia, and concealed above or within the edge of the tuberosity and ramus; so that to suc- ceed in wounding it in the operation would require a consider- able amount of design and dexterity with any ordinary lithotomy instrument. There is no allusion to the supposed danger of dividing the reflection of the pelvic fascia on the side of the prostate, so as to endanger infiltration of urine below the peritoneum ; and indeed the relations of the prostate and the formation of its sheath are but meagerly described. We have heard a great deal said about the danger of dividing this reflection of the fascia, but to us it appears the danger is an imaginaiy one, if the lateral operation be performed according to the common directions. The line of the reflection crosses the prostate obliquely, downwards and backwards, leaving in front about three-fourths, and behind two-thirds of the prostate, below this line. If, when the section of the prostate was being made, the knife was directed upwards and outwards, and carried at the same time deeply back through and beyond the neck of the bladder, the reflection of the fascia might be divided; but if the knife cuts even horizontally, or, as is usually directed, downwards and outwards, the reflection of the fascia, though, like the pudic artery, not very far away, is still perfectly safe. Anatomy of Fcetus.â€”In the description of the foetal vessels and heart, there is no direct statement of the fact that the point where the ductus arteriosus joins the arch of the aorta is invari- ably beyond the origin of the left subclavian, a fundamental point in connection with the foetal circulation; nor is it mentioned with the anatomy of the thorax, that the lefl recurrent nerve hooks

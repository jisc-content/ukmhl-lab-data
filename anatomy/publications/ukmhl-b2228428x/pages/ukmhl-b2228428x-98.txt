°° ANATOMICAL INQUIRY INTO THE mical recommendation as a local blood-letting. The mastoid communication from the lateral sinuses is to the occipital veins, aiid these communicate freely with the veins of the back of the neck; and also the arterial supply to the back of the neck, de- rived from the deep cervical and occipital arteries, has free com- munications with the posterior muscular twigs which the verte- bral arteries give off during their ascent to the brain. I do not, therefore, propose to include the brain amongst the internal viscera which cannot be specially relieved by local blood- letting, although at the same time it is not necessarily so from the mere fact of its lying inside opposite to where the treatment IS applied externally. Besides, we must recollect that here also there is the uncertainty of diagnosis in many cases, so that the affection we are treating may be situated either partially or en- tirely outside the arachnoid cavity; and even did no communica- tion .whatever exist between the blood-vessels of the internal and external parts here, so that no relief could take place by direct draining, it by no means follows that the practice of applying leeches to the scalp may not afford special relief to the brain, on the principle of derivation, or lessening the arterial currents to the organ within. Before leaving this part of the subject, it is well to remark, that ill these considerations I have not overlooked the question as to the non-variation of the quantity of blood, or at least of fluid, within the cranium. It would be out of place for me to enter on this question here, and I shall, therefore, merely remark, that, whilst I am one of those who cannot understand how the quantity of fluid within the cranium can vary, until it can be proved that the brain can be compressed, i.e., diminished in bidk, by any force that the heart is capable of exerting, I at the same time hold, that we ought not to allow this question to influence om* practice. Whichever view be coiTect, we have still the same principles to contend with in practice; we have, in both, increased or diminished pressure, and, in both, increased or diminished rapidity of the circulation; and it therefore appears to me that those are in error who suj)pose that this question should influence our practice or our reasoning thereon.

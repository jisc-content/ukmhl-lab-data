56 ON THE NERTES OF THE ORBIT. and to accomplish this the eyes must move so that the axes shall always converge more or less. For this purpose, then, we have, first, suitable muscles; secondly, nerves going to each; and, thirdly, these nerves are subjected to a central influence, by which these motions, otherwise voluntary, are regulated so as to establish and preserve the harmony of the ocular movements. However that influence may originate, or whatever its nature, whether we speak of it as an instinctive action or original endow- ment, or an irresistible influence, or as partly the result of the guiding sensations of the retinas, there is such a central influ- ence, which exerts itself, alike as a guide and check, on all the movements of the eyes, giving rise to a class of movements which stand by themselves, and can be compared to, or illustrated by, no others in the body. The nerves we should regard not as themselves possessed of special endowments, bvit merely as chan- nels by which the nervous centres, with their special endow- ments, act down u[)on the muscles. The mere fact of the third nerve supplying the superior recti by corresponding branches, does not explain why these two muscles should always act to- gether, because the neighbouring fibres to the levatoi'es palpe- brarum muscles are not so bound together. Again, the mere fact of the sixth nerve being a separate one, does not explain why the external rectus cannot be made to act with its fellow, from any endowment of the nerve, for that part of it which goes to the retractor muscle is not so tied up. But the reason why the nerves of the upper recti always act together, and why those of the external recti never do so, is simply, that they obey tlie central regulating influence; and the reason why the nerves which supply the levators of the upper eyelids may act sepa- rately, and that those fi.-om the sixth nei'ves to the retractor muscles in animals are not tied up from acting together, is simply, that such may be the case without interfering with the harmony of the ocular movements, by which the parallelism or convergence of the axes is preserved. Further, this regulat- ing influence is exerted no less in the parallel than in the non- corresponding movements. We have just as little power of moving one eye up and the other down as of making both look

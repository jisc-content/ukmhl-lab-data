ON THE NERVES OF THE ORBIT. 55 fined in its occurence to the iris; but the fact, as affecting the latter, seems to me to' be ;sufficiently explained by the decussation of the optic nerves. As each optic nerve divides, a part going into each tract, both sides of the nervous centre are necessarily and simultaneously affected by the stimulus. Thus the equal reflex action of both pupils is secured, independent of any ine- quality of the light falling on the two eyes, which, had there been no decussation, or had each nerve entirely crossed over to the other side, so that each retina regulated the reflex actions of one pupil only, would have caused an unequal state of the pupils; ajid thus we understand why an impression on one retina should cause a reflex action of the opposite pupil, just as readily and as completely as it does of the pupil of the same eye. Next, as to the sixth and fourth nerves, we observe that they do not act along with their fellows, but with the antagonist nerve of the opposite side, the fourth with the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle, and the sixth with that, also from the lower divi- sion of the third, which goes to the internal rectus,â€” and that these nerves go to one of each of the two pairs of muscles which are employed in non-corresponding movements. As regards the sixth nerve, it is worthy of remark that, in animals which possess a retractor muscle, which is supplied by the sixth nerve, a part of this nerve acts differently. It is probably the case that the retractor muscles act at least generally together; and here we have a single nerve, part of which is generally used with its fel- low, whilst the other part is not so, but with its antagonist of the opposite side. Now, if we endeavour to explain all these differences in the different nerves, or different parts of the same nerve, by saying that each nerve has a certain endowment whereby it always, or sometimes, or never, acts with its fellow of the other side, we must recollect that we are merely expressing the fact that we observe such and such to be the case, and take care not to put it so that our way of stating the fact should lead us to suppose that we have in any way explained it. The object of these differences in the mode of employment of all these nerves and muscles is, that both eyes may be used at the same time for single vision,

ON VARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY 176 Edinburgh student, which foi- some time after it was brought into notice by Monro secundus, led to a discussion among ana- tomists as to whether the hole really existed ; the point lying in this, that it is not a hole in the nervous substance or brain pro- per, but only in the lining serous membrane, as is still better seen in cases of chronic collection of serum in the ventricles, when we have seen it large enough to admit the point of the finger. As the foramen of Winslow does not transmit the vena porta?, but is a serous passage between the lesser and greater sacs, and is separated from the vein by a serous layer, so is the foramen of Monro an opening between the serous cavities of the third and lateral ventricles, and the plexus choroides does not pass through it, but bounds it behind, with a delicate serous layer between. It may be here observed that, although this foramen is named after Monro, it appears to have been well known to previous anatomists. Indeed, it is not easy to understand how it could have been overlooked. In the dissection of the base of the brain, when the grey matter in the floor of the third ventricle has given way so as to expose the ventricle, the two openings are so plainly visible behind the pillars of the fornix, that they could not have escaped the notice of the many accurate anatomists who described the brain before the time of Monro. The claims of that anato- mist to the discovery, now just a century ago, of these com- municating apertures, may be found in his work on the Brain, Eye, and Ear (1797) ; and the facts showing their existence to have been well known to previous anatomists, may be found in Sir Charles Bell's separate work on the anatomy of the brain, with engravings (1802), in which it is remarkedâ€”" the only dif- ference is that Winslow says it is a passage betwixt the third and the two lateral ventricles, while Dr Monro says it is a passage betwixt the two lateral ventricles and the third." The division of the middle portion or lobe of the cerebellum into several parts, each with a distinct name, is adopted; the superior into three parts, or at least three names, and the inferior into four, the names of which we abstain from repeating as a step towards their suppression. We cannot see any good pur- pose to be served by this subdivision, the greater part of which.

IX, DESCRIPTION or AN ESQUIMAUX FEMALE PELVIS. I GIVE tlie following notice of this pelvis with the twofold view of makiug its peculiarities known to those interested in the subject of the various forms and dimensions of the pelvis in the different races of man, or in different individuals; and of stiggesting to those of my pupils who may visit these regions, the endeavour to obtain the pelves of the Esquimaux as well as the skulls, of which latter so many have been brought to this country that we are now well acquainted with their usual characters. This pelvis was brought to me by my former pupil, Dr Pirie of LifiF. It was found by him " on the coast of Davis Straits dur- ing the summer of 1851. It was part of a female body which I discovered lying upon the land near Cape Hooper, in lat, N. 68° 6', Ion. W. 64° 36', and overlaid by a cairn of stones, which is the ordinary form of burial there." The true pelvis belongs most to the so-called square form of pelvis, but is remarkable chiefly from its large dimensions. The following are the measurements in inches, which I ascer- tained carefully along with Dr Pirie:— Brim, Cavity, Outlet, Conjugate. Transverse. 4| ' 6 6| 6i Oblique, 6*

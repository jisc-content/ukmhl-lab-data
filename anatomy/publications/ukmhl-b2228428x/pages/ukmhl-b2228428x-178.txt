ON VAEIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY 168 We feel somewhat at a loss to whicli of these classes to refer tlie work now before us. In the preface we are told the work is devoted to display by demonstration, " the component structures in their relation to each other, and their complicity in the injuries and surgical operations to which the body may be subjected," whilst the systematic anatomy is " treated of in my other anatomical work, the Anatomist's Vade Mecum." In accordance with this, the work is divided into chapters, embracing different regions of the body,—as Inferior Extremity—Superior Extremity—Thorax —Back—Head and Neck, etc.; and we hoped, on seeing this arrangement, that the work was intended truly to supply the deficiencies of the author's Vade Mecum as a trustworthy guide to the student of anatomy ; but have been much disappointed to fiind that this work does not treat essentially of regional, or at least of relative, anatomy, or " of the component structures in their relation to each other," but is arranged in a.manner pecu- liar to itself, and not so as to be incompatible with the greater past being a reprint from the author's Vade Mecum,—the 1845 edition of which we happened to compare with it. The description of each region commences with some general remarks on the parts to be found in it, and on theii- surgical in- terest ; but from this fair beginning, the description soon breaks down into systematic anatomy ; first of the muscles, and then of the vessels and nerves, each of these being usually described not only separate from the others, but without special reference to them. There may be exceptions to this general statement, but we are correct in saying of the extremities and head and neck, where relative anatomy should be more especially studied, that the above remark regarding the arrangement is correct. For instance, in the region of the palm of the hand, we find, after the fascia, first the muscles systematically described, down even to the interossei, then the arteries, and then the nerves, whilst no description is given here of the long flexor tendons, either in the palm or within theii- fibro-synovial canals along the fingers. Of all parts of the body the neck is that which separate syste- matic descriptions fail to convey a correct knowledge of, and where the relative anatomist is most at home, with his various

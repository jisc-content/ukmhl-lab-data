ANATOMICAL INQUIRY INTO THE 84 local blood-letting to the side or back relieve the bronchial veins. These end on the right side in the vena azygos, on the left in the left superior intercostal vein, on its way to terminate in the left innominate or in the lesser azygos vein. Now these same azygos and superior intercostal veins receive the blood returned from the side and back of the chest by the ordinary intercostal veins. But, in order to relieve the bronchial veins throuffh the inter- costals, the current in the latter would require to be reversed, which local blood-letting would scarcely produce, even although the intercostal veins were not, as they are, provided with valves. The wall of the chest is suppHed from various sources, cliiefly by the aortic intercostal arteries, which spring separately from the back part of the aorta. The other arteries come chiefly from the subclavian. The superior intercostal supplies the first inter- costal space; the internal mammary the anterior part of the thoracic wall, coursing down behind the cartilages of the ribs; the posterior scapular partly supplies the sui'face of the upper part of the back, where, however, the chief vessels come fi-om the pos- terior divisions of the aortic intercostals ; and lastly, the axillary aspect of the chest and the pectoral region ai'e supplied from the outside by the thoracic branches of the axillary artery; and all of these arteries are accompanied by corresponding veins. When, therefore, blood is drawn from any part of the thoracic wall, it comes either from the subclavian or axillary arteries, on the one hand, or, on the other, the thoracic intercostal arteries, the latter springing from the back part of the aorta, so that any increased flow by them would simply diminish the general volume and current within that vessel We see, therefore, that the vessels of the lungs can be reheved through the general circulation only, either, on the one hand, by a little derivation from the general current in the aorta, but which will not relieve the lungs more than the lower extremities; or, on the other, by lessening the quantity of blood returned by the veins to the right side of the heart. I think, then, it has now been sufficiently shown that local blood-letting on the chest cannot act on the heai-t and lungs ex- cept as a general blood-letting, and that there is, therefore, no

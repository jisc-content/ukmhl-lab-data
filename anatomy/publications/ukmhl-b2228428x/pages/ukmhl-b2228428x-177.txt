ON YARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY; CONSIDERED IN A REVIEW OF A MANUAL OF ANATOMY-^ [From the Edinbubgh Medical and Sukgical Journal, April 1854.] Since the first edition of this treatise was published, in 1838, several text-books on anatomy have appeared, and become the favourites with the student. As systematic works, we have had the translation of M. Cruveilhier's anatomy, and the new edition of Quain's anatomy, by Mr R. Quain and Dr Sharpey, both of them complete and authoritative works; and, as less comprehen- sive works, the Manual of Anatomy, by Dr Knox, besides our author's well-known systematic manual, entitled " the Anato- mist's Vade Mecum." As dissecting-room guides, treating ana- tomy regionally, and describing the parts as they lie in relation to each other, we have had the work of Mr Ellis, and also that of Mr Holden, both excellent guides in the dissecting-room; and, besides, we have the new and enlarged edition of the long famous Dublin Dissector, in which there is, to some extent, a combination of these two methods, by the introduction of dis- sections along with the muscles. 11 have reproduced this Review here, with the permission of the Editor of the Journal in which it appeared, as it contains my views and opinions on several points in anatomy. Although the work reviewed deserved, perhaps, a more severe condem- nation at the hands of a teacher of anatomy, I would not have retained the critical remarks here if they could have been separated from the others. 2 The Dissector's Manual of Practical and Surgical Anatomy.

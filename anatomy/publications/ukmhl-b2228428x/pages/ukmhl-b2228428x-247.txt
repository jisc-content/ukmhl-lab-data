237 ON THE FASCIA OF SCARPA. not form a covering to the femoral hernia, but a complete femo- ral hernia lies upon it; and its union, a little above Poupart's ligament, with the common superficial fascia, will tend to obstruct the farther upward passage of a femoral hernia. The femoral hernia, after it has passed down the crural canal (which is rather, as far as the hernia is concerned, a broad ring than a canal) be- comes complete by turning round the lower margin of the falci- form process, there being now no longer any dense structure to keep it from swelling forwards, and now passes up so as to lie upon the falciform process and on the inner part of Poupart's ligament. Here it lies on the fascia of Scarpa, and has insinu- ated itself into the space occupied by the glands, and, meeting with the angle of union between the superficial fascia and the fascia of Scarpa, it will be arrested in its farther progress upwards, although at the same time, irrespective of this, there is little na- tural tendency in the femoral hernia to continue to ascend, but rather simply to swell out in all directions, if it continues to enlarge. The true relation of the fascia of Scarpa to the fascia lata was, as far as I am aware, first correctly described by Mr Listen^ in a Memoir, the chief purpose of which was to show that the crural arch, or deep crural arch, is formed independent of Poupart's ligament, by the iliacportion of the fascia latapassingin behind Pou- part's ligament, and joining with the fascia transversalis; the union of the two, arching inwards over the vessels and crural ring, and forming a tight arch, which remains so after Poupart's ligament has been altogether dissected out. He describes the true orio-in of the fascia which I have described as that of Scarpa, and cor- rects the notion that it passes down upon the thigh. He thus very correctly describes the terminations or connections of the fascia lata at the groinâ€”" The iliac portion, forming the falciform process, is again divided into two layers ; the one passing ante- riorly to the abdominal muscles, and named the superficial ab- dominal fascia ; the other, again, lining their inner surface, and passing betwixt the transversalis muscle and peritoneum, forming the fascia transversalis.

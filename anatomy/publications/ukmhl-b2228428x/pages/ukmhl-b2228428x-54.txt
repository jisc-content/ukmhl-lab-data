44 ON THE NERVES OF THE OBBIT. exactly the case, at least with both eyes at the same time, we can readily understand why the oblique muscles, whilst they roll the eye round, may be employed also slightly to alter the direction of its axis, and why therefore paralysis of one of these muscles should cause double vision with separated images, unless when its antagonist on the same side is in action; that is, for instance, why paralysis of the right superior oblique should cause a second image to appear, belonging to the right eye, when the head was bent over to the same side, or unless when it was turned to the opposite side. Just in the same way as, in paralysis of the right sixth nerve, the patient has double vision when he looks to the right, but sees single when he looks to the left side. I cannot, however, see, still merely reasoning on the matter, why in para- lysis of the superior oblique, the false image should necessarily be situated below the other, because if the superior oblique has any little power in changing slightly the direction of the axis whilst it is rolling the upper part of the eye round towards the inner canthus, it will certainly be downward; and, when the muscle is paralysed, there would be a want of this slight downward motion, and the false image should therefore be, if not above, at least not below, the other. This I infer from the experiment of causing double vision by pressing one eye in different directions. If the right eye be pressed inwards with the finger, the false image moves to the left. If the eye be pushed up, by pressing, for in- stance with the end of a small key, deeply between the lower lid and the grbit, the false image moves up. And if, in a similar way, by pressing in deeply between the orbit and the upper lid, the axis be depressed, the false image will move down, and ap- pear beloio the one from the untouched eye, somewhat as in M. Szokalski's cases of presumed paralysis of the fourth nerve. My object in presenting these theoretical considerations, how- ever, is not to endeavour to prove the superior oblique not to have been affected in these cases, but to show on the one hand that this relative position of the two images, in diplopia, is not to be regarded as essential to establish the case as one of para- lysis of the superior oblique, a condition which might give rise to various positions of the false image; and on the other hand,

184 ON VARIOUS POINTS IN ANATOMY anatomist now knew, that in the recent eye tliere is absolutely none; and the single layer of cells by which the union between the capsule and the soft exterior of the lens is effected our author will find described and figured in Mr Bowman's lectures on the eye, published four years ago. In fig. 54 the Ims is drawn like that of a very old person, the axis or thickness little more than a third of the diameter or breadth. It is very common to find the lens figured out of all proportion to the eye, either too large or too small, too convex or too flat; but the proportions are easily struck if these points be recollectedâ€”that the breadth or width of the lens is one-third of the axis or diameter of the eye, and measures one-third of an inch, whilst the depth or thickness of the adult lens in the middle is one-sixth of an inch, that is, half the breadth. We read that the free border of the ciliary processes " rests against the circumference of the lens," but in the diagram they are made to overlap in front of the rim so far, that were the pupil fully dilated they would be clearly seen from without in the living eye. The exact relation of the tips of the ciliary processes to the lens is a point of much interest. The above description accords rather with the view of Galen than that of modern anatomists, who are aware that the tips of the processes are free, not involved behind in the plaitings of the hyaloid membrane, but floating loose in the posterior chamber; not touching the rim of the lens, but lying a little in front of it; but how far they actually overlap in front of the rim is not quite certain. The fact that they are not visible when the pupil is fully dilated might lead to the supposition that they were retracted along with the iris, from their connection Avith it, or from the action also of the ciliary muscle; but that they are not so altered we have found, on examining the eyes in the horse within half an hour, and the cat within a few minutes, after death, one eye having been previously brought fully under the influence of atro- pine, when no diflerence could be detected between the two eyes in the position of the tips' ciliary processes. Besides, the pupil of the human eye dilates only suflaciently far to equal the size of an average lens.

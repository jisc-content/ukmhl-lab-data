xyi. ON THE FASCIA OF SCARPA. The fascia whicli I shall describe under this name, is that usually termed the deep layer of the superficial fascia, or the true superficial fascia, of the groin, and frequently also the fascia of Scax-pa. Although the description of this fascia by Scarpa, as contained in the translation of his work on hernia, is very brief and imperfect, I shall retain the title fascia of Scarpa, as it is preferable to have a short specific name for a part to which frequent reference is to be made. This fascia, I believe, is not commonly understood fully, in the simplicity of its anatomy and importance of its surgicahbear- ings, and is, at least in some text books, incorrectly described. It is described as a deeper layer of the superficial fascia of the abdomen, passing down over Poupart's ligament, adhering to it as it crosses, and then terminating on the fascia lata across the groin, or by some it is said to pass down the femoral region, as a deeper layer of the superficial fascia there, separated from the other by the superficial vessels and glands, and spreading over the saphenous opening so as to form the cribriform fascia. In the common mode of conducting the dissection of the gi'oin, the true origin of the fascia is divided; and unless the dissection is made with a view to the demonstration of this fascia, its nature and connections cannot be seen or understood.

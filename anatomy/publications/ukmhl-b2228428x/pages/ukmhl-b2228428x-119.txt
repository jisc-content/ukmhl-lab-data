X. ON MALFORMATION 1 OP THE SEMILUNAR VALVES OF THE HEART, WIIH REMA.RKS ON THE VARIETIES OF THESE VALVES, AND ON THEIR NATURAL ACTION. [Read before the Edinbdrgh PiirsiOLOGicAi, Society, June 11, 1853.] CASE OF MALFORMATION OF THE AORTIC VALVES. There are two large valves, and one much smaller. The large valves are lateral, right and left, and separated posteriorly by the small one. The right measures 1| inch from horn to horn, the left ^ inch more. Depth of right, one inch, of left ^. Wliere they meet by their anterior horns, the left is at- tached half an inch below the right, the appearances indicating that this part of the valve had been lost. Also, this end of the left valve has a large smooth hole in it, which nearly admits the point of the little finger, and through which the blood must have regurgitated freely into the ventricle. Pos- teriorly the large valves are attached a little above the horns of the small one, and in each there is a perforation, in the left the size of a crow quill, and in the right of a common quill. Through these the blood would regurgi- tate only into the cavity of the lesser valve. Tlie small or sicpplementary valve measures five-eighths of an inch from horn to horn, and half an inch in depth. By its left horn it is attached a little below the top of the contiguous horn of the left valve, and by its right it joins the right valve one-fifth of an inch from the top of the posterior horn of the latter. Being attached a little lower than this end of the large valves, it would receive the blood which re- gurgitated through the perforations in them, and its cavity has a somewhat oblique inclination to the right side where the larger perforation looks down

Some anatomists (Muck and Desmoulins) had denied its existence in that animal. Retzius, admitting its presence, says it is very small; and it has been well and fully described by Mr Alfred Poland, ^ in a paper which, I regret to say, was unknown to me until a few weeks ago. I had dissected this ganglion in the horse several years previously, and observe in my notes, made in 1844, that it is described as " very distinct;" and I have a drawing of it made from another dissection in 1852.] 1 Guy's Hospital Reports, 1849.

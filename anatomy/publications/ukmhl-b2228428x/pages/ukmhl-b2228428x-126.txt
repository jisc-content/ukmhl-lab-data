ON THE SEMILUNAR VALVES OF THE HEART. 116 by the sinus beginning above the valve, so as to expose the mouth of the latter to the returning flow of the blood; all con- tributing to the rapid and complete closure of the valves. But this arrangement of sinuses behind the valves is not con- fined to the aortic and pulmonary valves; it seems to exist equally with all the valves of the vascular system ; in the lym- phatics as well as in the veins. The great importance of the valves in the veins, in the extremities especially,—to the veins of which, indeed, the valves are all but confined,—in rendering the muscles accessary to the onward motion of the blood in the veins, cannot be too much insisted on. Without them the muscles would tend to retard as much as to accelerate the venous flow, but the valves, not of themselves of direct use during the onward flow, prevent this, and render the action of the muscles equivalent to a second heart acting on the deep veins. In this way it is, that sudden and severe exercise makes us out of breath, by the rapidity with which the blood is thrown forwards to the heart, more rapidly than the lungs can at first transmit it; and this force, it must be recollected, is more or less constantly in action in the limbs, unless during sleep, or when the body is otherwise at complete rest, and then, the position being horizontal, the heart has only to circulate the blood through a set of level tiibes, at least it is so with the large returning veins. Now, the action of these valves is rendered certain by sinuses behind them, which natural sinuses or pouches, not any un- natural dilation of the vein by the injection meeting the resist- ing valves, is the cause of the swellings seen outside, in injected veins and lymphatic vessels ; and a valvular sinus is therefore an essential part in the construction of a mechanically acting valve. Some physiological writers seem to object to the view that the forcing action of the heart is the one great motive power of the circulation, under the impression that it is too mechanical a view of the matter; and have inferred on insufficient grounds, the existence of another motive power, or vis afronte, from the phenomena presented in the capillaries, in the exercise of the vital endowments of the blood and the tissues, necessarily exist-

Process was of good length, but now partly broken off. Median nerve passed round process, but artery did not. Uncertain whether a small branch did not accom- pany nerve. Left side. All anatomy normal. Female set. 4. 7. Eight side only. Process moderate. Median nerve passed round process, accompanied by small muscular artery from inferior profunda. Artery did not deviate—was crossed behind by median nerve—divides an inch above elbow, and ulnar passes superficially, close under aponeurosis of forearm. Left side. No process, but a well-marked groove, and slight roughness just where process arises on other side. High division of artery at lower edge of conjoined tendon. Ar- teries usual in position, separated only by median nerve. Female set. 50. 8. Left side. Nothing known of right. Process | of an inch in length. Nerve and artery pass round it. This specimen is from the case related by Dr Knox,^ and came into my possession with his Museum of Human Anatomy. Middle- aged male. 9. Left humerus in my collection, without any history. Eough ridge ^ inch in length, where process arises in other speci- mens, and a distinct groove behind it. The following are specimens in other museums or from cases described by others. 10. Both sides. Process well formed. Preparation of child, showing arteries, in Barclay collection in Museum of Edin- burgh College of Surgeons. Eiffht side. Artery passes round process. Left.

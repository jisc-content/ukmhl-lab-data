28 ON THE NERVES OF THE ORBIT. PART I.—ON THE MOTOR NERVES. The questions I propose to consider concerning the motor nerves are—1. Their cerebral connection; 2. Their relative dis- tribution, as connected with the movements of the eyeballs; and, 3. Their connections, in the cavernous sinus and orbit, with the fifth or common sensory nerve, and with the sympathetic. ORIGINS OF THE MOTOR NERVES. Third, Fourth, and Sixth Nerves.—In looking to the origins of these three motor oculi nerves, we are struck, in the first place, with the fact, that they are connected with very difierent parts of the brain. But some anatomists hold this to be only apparent, the true origins being deeper, and such as to establish a relation between them. I shall now examine briefly into the opinions of different anatomists on this point. The FOURTH nerve is usually said to arise from the upper part of the valve of Vieussens. Valentin^ describes it as arising partly from the testis, and partly from the valve of Vieussens. Cruveilhier^ says,—by one or several roots below the corpora quadrigemina, on each side of the valve of Vieussens; and, after alluding to the supposition that some of the fibres come from the cerebellum, and that others arise much deeper than the aj)parent origin, he adds, " all that can be seen is, that these nerves arise from the valve of Vieussens; and he farther states, that, "the nerves of the two sides are often united by some white streaks which form a transverse commissm-e." This nerve is believed by some to be derived from a tract of fibres which may be traced up firom the olivary body of the medulla oblongata, to ijelow the corpora quadrigemina. Dr John Eeid^ describes this tract very clearly as a motor one, and assigns this as the I Encyclop^die Anatomique. Ndvrologie. Tome iv. p. 257. G. Valentin, 1843. Descriptive Anatomy. 1841.

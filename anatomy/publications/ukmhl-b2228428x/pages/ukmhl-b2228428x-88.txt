Fifj. 1—Long-!tudinal plan of the arteries of the trunk. The left side shows both the longitudinal and transverse anastomosing arteries of the wall; the right side only tlie longitudinal and diaphragmatic anastomoses belonging to the wall, and the vari- ous visceral arteries springing from the aorta. , Left Side.—1, Internal mammary; and 2, deep epigastric; connected behind to aorta by series of intercostal, lumbar, and diaphragmatic arteries. 3, Superficial epigastric. 4, Circumflex iliac. 5, llio-lumbar from internal iliac. Right Side.— Branches of abdominal aorta, from above downwards; diaphragmatic, coeliac axis, superior mesenteric, right supra-renal and renal, right spermatic or ova- rian, and inferior mesenteric. Fig. 2.— Transverse plan of the arteries of the abdomen opposite to liver, spleen, and stomach. 1, Aorta, giving off from its back part the arteries (2, 2) for the wall, which unite in front with branches of the internal mammary arteries (3, 3). 4, Coeliac axis, coming from front of aorta, and supplying spleen, stomacli, and liver, the latter also receiving the vena portaj. Fig. 3. The same, lower down, showing portion of small intestine and sections of ascending and descending colon and of kidneys. 1, Aorta, giving off, behind, the lum- bar arteries (2, 2), which join in front with branches of the deep epigastric (3, 3). In front, as if coming from the aorta at the same part, are shown the superior and infe- rior mesenteric, and at the sides the renal arteries. Fig. 1 shows tlie order in which these visceral arteries come off at different stages of the aorta, and their relative size. The anatomist will notice that it is chiefly the anastomosing branches of the arte- ries of the wall which arc shown, and also that these are represented proportionally larger than natural.

MODE OF ACTION OF LOCAL BLOOD-LETTING. 91 ing afiFections of the viscera of tlie abdomen and chest, it is best tolake the blood from over the painful or affected part, ground- ing, however, the locahzation of our practice, not on the vague belief that we can thereby specially relieve the viscus, but on the uncertainty of diagnosis, which leaves us unable to say whether the wall also is affected or not. But whilst this may be laid down as the general rule, which may be safely followed by all in all cases, it is at the same time to be remarked, that cases may occur in which it is the object of the practitioner simply to lessen the quantity of blood in a con- gested or over-active viscus ; and after he has duly exercised his judgment in the matter, I think enough has been said to prove that then he may cup or leech on any part he chooses, or instead, take an equal quantity from the arm, or from a vein in some other situation, resting assured that it is only on the principle of a general blood-letting that these internal viscera can be acted upon. It may be urged that experiments of this kind are not war- rantable ;â€”first. Because, on my own showing, the blood-letting from over the painful part will prove at least equally beneficial with one from any other part, whilst the rule is simple as a ge- neral guide to the practitioner, besides being more likely to en- sure the confidence of the patient; and, second. Because expe- rience has led to the adoption of the local practice. To this it may be answered, that experience has by no means proved the superiority of the local over the general blood-letting in affections of the internal viscera. We can readily understand how expe- rience may have established the superiority of the local blood- letting in affections of the chest and abdomen generally, because we know that in a large number of them the pleura and ])erito- neum are involved to our certain knowledge; whilst in those cases where we with equal certainty know the viscera to be affected, we do not know but that the atfection may also in part involve the wall. But experience has not yet declared that two or four ounces of blood taken from over the kidney, or liver, or lung, will afford more relief to these viscera than two or four ounces taken from the hand or foot, or by venesection from the

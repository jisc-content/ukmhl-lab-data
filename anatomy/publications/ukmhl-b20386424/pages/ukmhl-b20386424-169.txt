I TIBIA. EK T. (.ATERAL LIO. The Tibia. ' The Tibia (so named from its resemblance to a flute or pipe) is situated at the front and inner side of the leg, and, excepting the ^^7,,^^..... femur, is the longest and largest bone in the skeleton. It is pris- moid in form, expanded above, where it enters into formation with the knee joint, more slightly- enlarged below. In the male, its direction is vertical, and parallel with the bone of the opposite side; but in the female it has a slight oblique direction downwards and outwards, to compensate for the oblique direction of the femur inwards. It presents for exami- nation a shaft and two extre- mities. The Upper Extremity^ or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral emi- nences, the tuberosities. Supe- riorly, the tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which articulate with the con- dyles of the femur; the internal articular surface is longer than the external, oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle; the external one being broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular surfaces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is an eminence, the spinous process of the tibia, surmounted by a pro- minent tubercle on each side, which give attachment to the extremities of the semilunar fibro-cartilages; and in front and behind the spinous process, a rough depression for the attach- ment of the anterior and poste- rior crucial ligaments and the semilunar cartilages. Anteriorly the tuberosities are continuous with one another, presenting a large and somewhat flattened triangular surface, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina, narrow below, where it terminates in a prominent 09.â€”Bones of the Right Leg.

691 THYMUS GLAND. contains numerous dotted corpuscles, similar to those found in the chyle. The corpuscles are flattened circular discs, measuring about ytj^j?)- of an inch in dia- meter. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the thymus are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins termi- nate in the left vena innominata, and in the thyroid veins. The lymphatics are of large size, arise in the substance of the gland, and are said to terminate in the internal jugular vein. Sir A. Cooper considered that these vessels carried into the blood the secretion formed in the substance of the thymus. The nerves are exceedingly minute; they are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. Branches from the descendens noni and phrenic reach the investing capsule, but do not penetrate into the substance of the gland. Chemical Composition. The solid animal constituents of the thymus are albu- men and fibrine in large quantities, gelatine and other animal matters. The salts are alkaline and earthy phosphates, with chloride of potassium. It contains about 80 per cent, of water. Y Y 2

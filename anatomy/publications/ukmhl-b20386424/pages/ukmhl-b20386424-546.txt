CRANIAL NERVES. 510 The Chorda tympani is given off from the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of the tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It ascends from below upwards in a distinct canal, parallel with the aqueductus Fallopii, and enters the cavity of the tym- panum through an opening between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen (the canal of Huguier) at the inner side of 278.â€”The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, and Side of the Neck. the Glasserian fissure. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, and meets the gustatory nerve at an acute angle, after communicating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland; it then joins the submaxillary ganglion, and terminates in the Lingualis muscle. The Posterior auricular nerve arises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards in front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament

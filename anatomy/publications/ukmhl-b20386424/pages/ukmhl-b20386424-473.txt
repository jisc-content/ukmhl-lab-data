This vessel is joined by the left vertebral, left inferior thyroid, left internal mammary, and the left supe- rior intercostal veins, and occasionally some thymic 241.â€”The Vense Cavee and Azygos Veins, J - J- with their Format ve Branche.s. and pericardiac veins. There are no valves in the venae innominatae. Peculiarities. Sometimes the innominate veins open separately into the right auri- cle ; in such cases the right vein takes the ordinary course of the superior vena cava, but the left vein, after communi- cating by a small branch with the right one, passes in front of the root of the left lung, and turning to the back of the heart, receives the cardiac veins, and terminates in the back of the right auricle. This occasional condition of the veins in the adult, is a regular one in the foetus at an early period, and the two ves- sels are persistent in birds and some mammalia. The subsequent changes which take place in these vessels are the following. The communi- cating branch between the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left innominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is obliterated as far as the heart, where it re- mains pervious, and forms the coronary sinus ; a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall, the vestigial fold of the pericardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corres- ponding with those derived from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, commu- nicating with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one, descends in

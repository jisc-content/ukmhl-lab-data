The posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and generally presents on its inner surface a broad shallow groove for lodging part of the lateral sinus. Development. The parietal bone is formed in membrane, being developed by one centre, which corresponds with the parietal eminence, and makes its first appearance about the fifth or sixth week of foetal life. Ossification gradually 26.—Left Parietal Bone.

Articulations. With five bones ; the opposite parietal, the occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles. To one only, the Temporal. The Frontal Bone. This bone, which resembles a cockle-shell in form, consists of two portions— a vertical or frontal portion, situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead; and a horizontal or orbito-nasal portion, which enters into the formation of the roof of the orbits and nose. Vertical Portion. External Surface (fig. 27). In the median line, traversing the bone from the upper to its lower part, is occasionally seen a slightly elevated ridge, and in young subjects a suture, which represents the point of union of the two lateral halves of which the bone consists at an early period of life: in the adult, this suture usually disappears, excepting below. On either side of this ridge, a little below the centre of the bone, is a rounded eminence, the frontal

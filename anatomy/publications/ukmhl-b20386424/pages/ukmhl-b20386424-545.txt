FACIAL. 509 hiatus Fallopii, where it forms a reddish gangliform swelling (intumescentia ganglioformis), and is joined by several nerves; bending suddenly backwards, it runs in the internal wall of the tympanum, above the fenestra ovalis, and at the back of this cavity passes vertically downwards to the stylo-mastoid foramen. On emerging from this aperture, it runs forwards in the substance of the parotid gland, crosses the external carotid artery, and divides behind the ramus of the lower jaw into two primary branches, temporo-facial and cervico-facial, from which numerous offsets are distributed over the side of the head, face, and upper part of the neck, supplying the superficial muscles in these regions. The communications of the facial nerve may be thus arranged:— In the internal auditory meatus . In the aqueductus Fallopii At its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen . . . . On the face .... With the auditory nerve. With Meckel's ganglion by the large petrosal nerve. With the otic ganglion by the small petrosal nerve. With the sympathetic on the middle me- ningeal by the external petrosal nerve. With the pneumogastric. „ glosso-pharyngeal. „ carotid plexus. „ auricularis magnus. „ auriculo-temporal. With the three divisions of the fifth. In the intenifil auditory meatus, some minute filaments pass between the fjicial and auditory nerves. Opposite the hiatus Fallopii, the gangliform enlargement on the facial nerve communicates, by means of the large petrosal nerve, with Meckel's ganglion, forming its motor root; by a filament from the small petrosal, with the otic ganglion; and by the external petrosal, with the sympathetic filaments accom- panying the middle meningeal artery (Bidder). From the gangliform enlarge- ment, according to Arnold, a twig is sent back to the auditory nerve. At its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it sends a twig to the pneumogastric, another to the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and communicates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, with the great auricular branch of the cervical plexus, with the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve in the parotid gland, and on the face with the terminal branches of the three divisions of the fifth.

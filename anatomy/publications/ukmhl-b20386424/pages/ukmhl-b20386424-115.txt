It presents two apertures. In front is the orifice of the infun- dibulum, by which the middle meatus communicates with the anterior ethmoidal cells, and through these with the frontal sinuses. At the centre of the outer wall —Inner Wall of Nasal Fosste, or Septum of Nose.

The inferior meatus, the largest of the three, is the space between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It extends along the entire length of the outer wall of the nose, is broader in front than behind, and presents anteriorly the lower orifice of the lachrymal canal. Os Hyoides. The Hyoid bone is named from its resemblance to the Greek Upsilon; it is also called the lingual hone, from supporting the tongue, and giving attachment to its numerous muscles. It is a bony arch, shaped like a horse-shoe, and consisting of five segments, a central portion or body, two greater cornua, and two lesser cornua. The Body forms the central part of the bone, is of a quadrilateral form, anterior surface (fig. 68) convex, directed forwards and upwards, is divided into two parts by a vertical ridge, which descends along the median line, and is crossed at right angles by a horizontal ridge, so that this surface is divided into four muscular depressions. At the point of meeting of these two lines is a promi- nent elevation, the tubercle. The portion above the horizontal ridge is directed up- wards, and is sometimes described as the superior border. The anterior surface its 68.—I-Iyoid Bone. Anterior Surface.

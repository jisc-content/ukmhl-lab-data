ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 686 The posterior border is rounded and broad, and is received in the deep con- cavity on either side of the spinal column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects below between the ribs and Diaphragm. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the pericardium. The anterior border of the right lung corresponds to the median line of the sternum, and is in contact with its fellow, the pleurse being interposed, as low as the fourth costal cartilage; below this, the contiguous borders are separated by an irregularly shaped interval, formed at the expense of the anterior border of the left lung, and corresponding to which the pericardium is exposed. 366.â€”Front View of the Heart and Luugs. Each lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and lower, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the upper part of the posterior border of the organ, about three inches from its apex, downwards and forwards to the lower part of its anterior border. This fissure penetrates nearly to the root. In the right lung the upper lobe is partially divided by a second and shorter fissure, which extends from the middle of the preceding, forwards and upwards, to the anterior margin of the organ, marking off a small triangular portion, the middle lobe. The right lung is the largest; it is broader than the left, owing to the inclination of the heart to the left side; it is also shorter by an inch, in consequence of the Diaphragm rising higher on the right side to accommodate the liver. The right lung has also three lobes. The left lung is smaller, narrower, and longer than the right, and has only two lobes.

A block having been placed at the back of the neck, and the face turned to the side opposite to that to be dissected, so as to place the parts upon the stretch, two transverse incisions are to be made: one from the chin, along the margin of the lower jaw, to the mastoid process; and the other along the upper border of the clavicle. These are to be connected by an oblique incision made in the course of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, from the mastoid process to the sternum ; the two flaps of integument having been removed in the direction shewn in fig. 14.7, the superficial fascia will be exposed. The superficial cervical fascia is exposed on the removal of the integument from the side of the neck; it is an extremely thin aponeurotic lamina, which is hardly demonstrable as a separate membrane. Beneath it is found the Platysma- myoides muscle, the external jugular vein, and some superficial branches of the cervical plexus of nerves. The Platysma Myoides (fig. 148) is a broad thin plane of muscular fibres, placed immediately beneath the skin on each side of the neck. It arises from the clavicle and acromion, and from the fascia covering the upper part of the Pectoral, Deltoid, and Trapezius muscles; its fibres proceed obliquely upwards and inwards along the side of the neck, to be inserted into the lower jaw beneath the external oblique line, some fibres passing forwards to the angle of the mouth, and others becoming lost in the cellular tissue of the face. The most anterior fibres interlace, in front of the jaw, with the fibres of the muscle of the opposite side; those next in order become blended with the Depressor labii inferioris and the Depressor anguli oris; others are prolonged upon the side of the cheek, and interlace, near the angle of the mouth, with the muscles in this situation, and may occasionally be traced to the Zygomatic muscles, or to the margin of the Orbicularis palpebrarum.

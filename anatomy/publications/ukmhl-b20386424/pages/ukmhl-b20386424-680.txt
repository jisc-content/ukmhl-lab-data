ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 632 border, and gives attachment to the great omentum. The surfaces of the organ are limited by these two curvatures. The anterior surface is directed upwards and forwards, and is in relation with the Diaphragm, the under surface of the left lobe of the liver, and, in the epigastric region, with the abdominal parietes. 333.â€”The Mucous Membrane of the Stomach and Duodenum, with the Bile Ducts. The posterior surface is directed downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the pancreas and great vessels of the abdomen, the crura of the Diaphragm, and the solar plexus. The stomach is held in position by the lesser omentum, which extends from the transverse fissure of the liver to its lesser curvature, and by a fold of peri- toneum, which passes from the Diaphragm on to the oesophageal end of the stomach, the gastro-phrenic ligament; this constitutes the most fixed point of the stomach, whilst the pyloric end and greater curvature are the most moveable parts: hence, when this organ becomes greatly distended, the greater curvature is directed forwards, whilst the anterior and posterior surfaces are directed, the former upwards, and the latter downwards. Alterations in Position. There is no organ in the body the position and connexions of which present such frequent alterations as the stomach. During inspiration it is displaced downwards by the descent of the Diaphragm, and elevated by the pressure of the abdo- minal muscles during expiration. Its position to the surrounding viscera is also changed, according to the empty or distended state of the organ. When empty^ it occupies only a small part of the left hypochondriac region, the si^leen lying behind it; the left lobe of the liver covers it in front, and the under surface of the heart rests upon it above, and in front, being separated from it by the left lobe of the liver and pericardium. Hence it is, that, in gastralgia, the pain is generally referred to the heart, and is often accompanied by

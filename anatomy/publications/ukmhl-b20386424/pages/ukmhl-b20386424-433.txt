397 COMMON ILIAC. Peculiarities. Its 2yoint of origin varies according to the bifurcation of the aorta. In three-fourths of a large number of cases, the aorta bifarcaied either upon the fourth lumbar vertebra, or upon the intervertebral disc between it and the fifth; one case in nine being below, and one in eleven above this point. In ten out of every thirteen cases, the vessel bifurcated within half an inch above or below the level of the crest of the ilium ; more frequently below than above. The point of division is subject to great variety. In two-thirds of a large number of cases, it was between the last lumbar vertebra and the upper border of the sacrum ; in one case in eight being above, and in one in six below that point. The left common iliac artery divides lower down more frequently than the right. The relative length, also, of the two common iliac arteries varies. The right common iliac was longest in sixty-three cases ; the left, in fifty-two; whilst they were both equal in fifty-three. The length of the arteries varied in five-sevenths of the cases examined, from an inch and a-half to three inches; in about half of the remaining cases, the artery was longer ; and in the other half, shorter; the minimum length being less than half an inch, the maximum, four and a-half inches. In one instance, the right common iliac was found wanting, the external and internal iliacs arising directly from the aorta. 227.â€”Arteries of the Pelvis. Surgical Anatomy. The application of a ligature to the common iliac artery may be required on account of aneurism or hremorrhage, implicating the external or internal iliacs, or on account of secondary haemorrhage after amputation of the thigh high up. It has been seen, that the origin of this vessel corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus on a level with a hne drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the opposite one, and its course to a line extending from the left side of the umbihcus downwards towards the

Its relation with the tonsil should be esj^tecially remembered, as instances have occurred in which the artery has been wounded, during the operation of scarifying the tonsil, and fatal haemorrhage has supervened. The branches given off from the internal carotid are: The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches. The tympanic is a small branch w^hicli enters the cavity of the tympanum, through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomoses v^itli the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and stylo-mastoid arteries. The arteries receptaculi ai-e numerous small vessels, derived from the internal carotid in the cavernous sinus ; they supply the pituitary body, the Casserian ganglion, and the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. One of these branches, distributed to the dura mater, is called the anterior meningeal; it anastomoses with the middle meningeal. The Ophthalmic Artery arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel IS emerging from the cavernous sinus, on the inner side of the anterior clinoid 213-â€”The Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Koof of the Orbit having been removed.

OSTEOLOGY. 96 time when the other centres make their appearance. Between the fifteenth and seventeenth years, ossification of the remaining centres takes place in quick suc- cession, and in the following order: first, near the base of the acromion, and in the upper part of the coracoid process, the latter appearing in the form of a broad scale; secondly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the posterior border; thirdly, near the extremity of the acromion; fourthly, in - the posterior border. The acromion process, besides being formed of two separate nuclei, has its base formed by an extension into it of the centre of ossification which belongs to the spine, the extent of which varies in different cases. The two separate nuclei unite, and then join with the extension carried in from the spine. These various epiphyses become joined to the bone between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- five years. Sometimes failure of union between the acromion process and spine occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation; 86.â€”Plan of the Development of the Scapula. By Seven Centres. Epiphyses (except one for the Coracoid process) appear at fifteen to seventeen years, and unite at twenty-two to twenty-five years. in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.

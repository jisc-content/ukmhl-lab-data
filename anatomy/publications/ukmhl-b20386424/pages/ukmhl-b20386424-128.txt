OSTEOLOGY. 92 often deficient. This marginal surface affords attachment throughout its entire extent to the Serratus magnus muscle. The subscapular fossa presents a trans- verse depression at its upper part, called the subscapular angle; it is in this situ- ation that the fossa is deepest; and consequently the thickest part of the Subscapularis muscle lies in a line parallel with the glenoid cavity, and must consequently operate most effectively on the humerus which is contained in it. posterior surface, or dorsum (fig. 85) is arched from above downwards, alternately convex and concave from side to side. It is subdivided unequally into 84.â€”Left Scapula. Anterior Surface, or Venter. two parts by the spine; that portion above the spine is called the supra-spinous fossa, and that below it, the infra-spinous fossa. The supra-spinous fossa, the smaller of the two, is concave, smooth, and broader at the vertebral than at the humeral extremity. It affords attachment by its inner two-thirds to the Supra-spinatus muscle. The infra-spinous fossa is much larger than the preceding; towards its ver- tebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part; its centre presents a

Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebra. The Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebree consist, at an early period of life, of nine separate pieces, which are united in the adult, so as to form two bones, five entering into the formation of the sacrum, four the coccyx. The Sacrum (so called from its having been offered in sacrifice, and hence considered sacred), (fig. 14), is a large triangular bone, situated at the lower part 14.—Sacrum, Anterior Surface. of the vertebral column, and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted like a w^edge between the two ossa innominata; its upper part, or base, articulating with the last lumbar vertebra, its apex with the coccyx. The sacrum is curved upon itself, and placed very obliquely, its upper extremity projecting forwards, forming, with the last lumbar vertebra, a very prominent angle, called the promontory or sacro-vertebral angle, whilst its central part is directed backwards, so as to give increased capacity to the pelvic cavity. It pre-

426 VEINS The Facial Vein passes obliquely across the side of the face, extending from the inner angle of the orbit, downwards and outwards, to the anterior margin of the Masseter muscle. It lies to the outer side of the facial artery, and is not so tortuous as that vessel. It commences in the frontal region, where it is called the frontal vein; at the inner angle of the eye it has received the name of the angular vein; and from this point to its termination, the facial vein. 236.â€”Veins of the Head and Neck. The frontal vein commences on the anterior part of the skull, by a venous plexus, which communicates with the anterior branches of the temporal vein; the veins converge to form a single trunk, which descends along the middle line of the forehead parallel with the vein of the opposite side, and unites with it at the root of the nose by a transverse trunk, called the nasal arch. Occasionally the frontal veins join to form a single trunk which bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. At the nasal arch the branches diverge, and run along the side of the root of the nose. The frontal vein as it descends upon the forehead, re- ceives the supra-orbital vein; the dorsal veins of the nose terminate in the nasal

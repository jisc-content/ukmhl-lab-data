SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. 748 In the lateral operation of lithotomy, the knife is carried obliquely across the back part of this space, downwards and outwards, into the ischio-rectal fossa, dividing the Transversus perintBi muscle and artery, the posterior fibres of the Accelerator urinse, the superficial perinseal vessels and nerve, and, more posteriorly, the external heemorrhoidal vessels. The superficial and transverse perinseal arteries are described at p. 402; and the superficial perinasal and inferior pudendal nerves, at pp. 554, 556. The Accelerator urinse and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinssal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 392.â€”Deep Perinseal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior layer has been removed. The muscles of the perinaeum in the female are, the Sphincter vaginae. Compressor urethrge. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter ani. Transversus perinasi. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter VagincB surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinae in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perinaeum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perincei is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginae, and

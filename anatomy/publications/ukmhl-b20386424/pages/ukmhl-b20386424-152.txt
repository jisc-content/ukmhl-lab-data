ii6 OSTEOLOGY. Development of the Hand. The Carpal bones are each developed by a single centre; at birth they are all cartilaginous. Ossification proceeds in the following order (fig. 96); in the os magnum and unciform an ossific point appears during the first year, the former preceding the latter; in the cuneiform, at the third year; in the trapezium and semi-lunar, at the fifth year, the former preceding the latter; in the scaphoid, at the sixth year; in the trapezoid, during the eighth year; and in the pisiform, about the twelfth year. 96.â€”Plan of the Development of the Hand.

The Metacarpal bones are each developed by two centres: one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, for the four inner metacarpal bones; one for the shaft and one for the base, for the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which, in this respect, resembles the phalanges. Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the sixth week, and gradually proceeds to either end of the bone; about the third year the digital extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones and the base of the first metacarpal, commence to ossify, and they unite about the twentieth year. The Phalanges are each developed by two centres: one for the shaft and one for the base. Ossification commences in the shaft, in all three rows, at about the sixth week, and gradually involves the whole of the bone excepting the upper extremity. Ossification of the base commences in the first row between the third and fourth years, and a year later in those of the second and third row. The two centres become united in each row, between the eighteenth and twentieth years.

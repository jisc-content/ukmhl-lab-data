ARTERIES. 422 and has attached to it, above, the fibrous layer of this membrane. Behind, it rests at first upon the ascending aorta, and higher up in front of the left auricle. On either side of its origin is the appendix of the corresponding auricle, and a coronary artery; and higher up it passes to the left side of the ascending aorta. A little to the left of its point of bifurcation, it is connected to the under surface of the arch of the aorta by a short fibrous cord, the remains of a vessel peculiar to foetal life, the ductus arteriosus. The right pulmonary artery, longer and larger than the left, runs horizontally outwards, behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava, to the root of the right lung, where it divides into two branches, of which the lower, the larger, supplies the lower lobe; the upper giving a branch to the middle lobe. The left pulmonary artery, shorter but somewhat smaller than the right, passes horizontally in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes.

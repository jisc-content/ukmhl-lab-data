547 LUMBAR PLEXUS. 1 descending filament to the fourth, and divides into two branches, which assist in forming the anterior crural and obturator nerves. The fourth nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and the obturator; furnishes part of the accessory obturator, and gives off a communicating branch to the fifth lumbar. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the • Ilio-hypogastric. • Ilio-inguinal. ■ Genito-crural. External cutaneous. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supj^lies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen; I the other group, which includes the remaining nerves, supplies the fore part of the thigh and inner side of the leg. 290.—The Lumbar Plexus and its Branches. The Ilio-hypogastric nerve {superior musculo-cutaneous) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It pierces the outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in front of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its back part, and divides between it and the Infernal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric. NN 2 Obturator. Accessory obturator. Anterior crural.

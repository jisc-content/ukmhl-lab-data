It passes backwards and inwards, be- neath the Flexor sublimis, and ascends behind the inner condyle of the humerus. In the interval between this eminence and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending be- tween the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve; it supplies the neigh- bouring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recurrent arteries. The interosseous artery is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of con- siderable size, which arises immediately below the tu- berosity of the radius, and, passing backwards to the upper border of the inter- osseous membrane, divides into two branches, the an- terior, and posterior inter- osseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the fore-arm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane.

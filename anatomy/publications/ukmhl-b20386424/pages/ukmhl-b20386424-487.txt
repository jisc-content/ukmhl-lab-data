451 THORACIC DUCT. Thoracic Duct. 247.â€”The Thoracic and Right Lymphatic Ducts. Tnter-costal Glanits The thoracic duct (fig. 247) conveys the great mass of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, excepting those of the right side of the head, neck, and thorax, and right upper ex- tremity, the right lung, right side of the heart, and the convex surface of the liver. It varies from eighteen to twenty inches in length in the the adult, and extends from the second lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck. It commences in the abdomen by a triangular dilatation, the receptaculum chyli (reservoir or cistern of Pecquet), which is situated upon the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, to the right side and behind the aorta, by the side of the right crus of the Diaphragm. It ascends into the thorax through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and is placed in the posterior mediastinum in front of the vertebral column, lying be- tween the aorta and vena azygos. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra it inclines to- wards the left side and ascends behind the arch of the aorta, on the left side of the oeso- phagus, and behind the first portion of the left subclavian artery, to the upper orifice of the thorax. Opposite the upper border of the seventh cervical vertebra it curves downwards above the sub- clavian artery, and in front of the Scalenus muscle, so as to form an arch; and ter- minates near the angle of junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The thoracic duct, at its com- mencement, is about equal in size to the diameter of a goose- quill, diminishes consider- ably in its calibre in the middle of the thorax, and is again dilated just before its termination. It is generally flexuous in its course, and constricted at intervals go as to present a varicose G G 2

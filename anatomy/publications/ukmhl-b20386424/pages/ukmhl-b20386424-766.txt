FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 7i8 with mucous glands and follicles, which are especially numerous in its upper part, and around the cervix uteri. The Uterus. The uterus is the organ of gestation, receiving the fecundated ovum in its cavity, retaining and supporting it during the development of the foetus^ and the principal agent in its expulsion at the time of parturition. In the virgin state it is pear-shaped, flattened from before backwards, and situated in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum; it is re- tained in its position by the round and broad ligaments on each side, and projects into the upper end of the vagina below. Its upper end, or base, is directed upwards and forwards; its lower end, or apex, downwards and backwards, in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis, forming an angle with the vagina, the direction of which corresponds to the cavity and outlet of the pelvis. The uterus measures about three inches in length, two in breadth, at its upper part, and an inch in thickness, and it weighs from an ounce to an ounce and a half. The fu7idus is the upper broad extremity of the organ: it is convex, covered by peritoneum, and placed on a line below the level of the brim of the pelvis. The body gradually narrows from the fundus to the neck. Its anterior surface is flattened, covered by peritoneum in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and separated from the bladder by some convolutions of the small intestine: the lower fourth is connected with the bladder. Its posterior surface is convex, covered by peritoneum throughout, and separated from the rectum by some convolutions of the intestine. Its lateral margins are concave, and give attachment to the Fallopian tube above, the round ligament below and in front of this, and the ligament of the ovary behind and below these. The cervix is the lower rounded and constricted portion of the uterus: around its circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, which extends upwards a greater distance behind than in front. At the vaginal extremity of the uterus is a transverse aperture, the os uteri, bounded by two lips, an anterior one, which is thick, a posterior narrow and long. Ligaments. The ligaments of the uterus are six in number: two anterior, two posterior, and two lateral. They are formed of peritoneum. The two anterior ligaments {vesico-uterine), are two semilunar folds, which pass between the neck of the uterus and the posterior surface of the bladder. The two posterior ligaments (recto-uterine), pass between the sides of the uterus and rectum. The two lateral, or broad ligaments, pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis, forming a septum across the pelvis, which divides this cavity into two portions. In the anterior part are contained the bladder, urethra, and vagina; in the posterior part, the rectum. The cavity of the uterus is small in comparison with the size of the organ: that portion corresponding to the body is triangular, flattened from before back- wards, so that its walls are closely aj)proximated, and having its base directed upwards towards the fundus. At each superior angle is a funnel-shaped cavity, which constitutes the remains of the division of the body of the uterus into two cornua; and at the bottom of each cavity is the minute orifice of the Fallopian tube. At the inferior angle of the uterine cavity is a small constricted opening, the internal orifice {ostium internum), which leads into the cavity of the cervix. The cavity in the cervix is somewhat cylindrical, flattened from before backwards, broader at the centre than at either extremity, and communicates, below, with the vagina. Each wall of the canal presents a longitudinal column, from which proceed a number of small oblique columns, giving the appearance of branches from the stem of a tree, and hence the name arbor vitcB uterinus, applied to it. These folds usually become very indistinct after the first labour.

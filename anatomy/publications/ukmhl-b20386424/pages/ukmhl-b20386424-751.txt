Male Generative Organs. Prostate Gland. THE Prostate Gland (TrpoiarTj/iiL, to stand before) is a pale, firm, glandular body, which surrounds the neck of the bladder and commencement of the urethra. It is placed in the pelvic cavity, behind and below the symphysis pubis, posterior to the deep perineal fascia, and upon the rectum, through which it may be distinctly felt, especially when enlarged. In shape and size it resembles a horse-cliesnut. Its base is directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder. The apex is directed forwards to the deep perinaeal fascia, which it touches. Its under surface is smooth, and rests on the rectum, to v/hich it is connected by a dense areolar fibrous tissue. Its ujp'per surface is flattened, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and placed about three-quarters of an inch below the pubic symphysis. It measures about an inch and a half in its transverse diameter at the base, an inch in its anterior posterior diameter, and three-quarters of an inch in depth; and its weight is about six drachms. It is held in its position by the anterior ligaments of the bladder {pubo-prostatic)-, by the posterior layer of the deep perinasal fascia, which invests the commencement of the membranous portion of the urethra and prostate gland; and by the anterior portion of the Levator ani muscle {levator prostata-), which passes down on each side from the symphysis pubis and anterior ligament of the bladder to the sides of the prostate. The prostate consists of three lobes; two lateral and a middle lobe. The two lateral lobes are of equal size, separated behind by a deep notch, and marked by a slight furrow upon their upper and lower surface, which indicates the bi-lobed condition of the organ in some animals. The third or middle lobe is a small, transverse band, occasionally a rounded or triangular prominence, placed between the two lateral lobes at the under and pos- terior part of the organ. It lies immediately beneath the neck of the bladder, behind the commencement of the uretlira, and above the ejaculatory ducts. Its existence is not constant, but it is occasionally found at an early period of life, as well as in adults, and in old age. In advanced life it often becomes considerably enlarged, and projects into the bladder, so as to impede the evacuation of the urine. The prostate gland is perforated by the urethra and common seminal ducts. The urethra usually lies about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface; occasionally, the prostate surrounds only the lower three-fourths of this tube, and it more rarely runs through the lower than the upper part of the gland. The ejaculatory ducts pass forwards obliquely through a conical canal, situated in the lower part of the prostate, and open into the prostatic portion of the urethra. Structure. The prostate is enclosed in a thin but firm fibrous capsule, distinct from that derived from the posterior layer of the deep perinaeal fascia, and separated from it by a plexus of veins. Its substance is of a pale, reddish-grey colour, very friable, but of great density. It consists of glandular substance and muscular tissue. The glandular substance is composed of numerous follicular pouches, opening into elongated canals, which join to form from twelve to twenty small excretory ducts. The follicles are connected together by areolar tissue, supported by pro- longations from the fibrous capsule, and enclosed in a delicate capillary plexus. The epithelium lining the canals is columnar, whilst that in the terminal vesicles is of the squamous variety. The muscular tissue of the prostate is arranged in the form of circular

The sphenoid bone is developed by ten centres, six for the pos- terior sphenoidal division, and four for the anterior sphenoid. The six centres for the post-sphenoid are, one for each greater wing and external pterygoid plate; 37.â€”Plan of the Development of Sphenoid, one for each internal pterygoid plate; two for posterior part of the body. The four for the anterior sphenoid are, one for each lesser wing and anterior part of the body; and one for each sphenoidal tur- binated bone. Ossification takes place in these pieces in the following order: the greater wing and external pterygoid plate are first formed, ossific granules being deposited close to the foramen rotundum on each side, at about the second month of foetal life; ossification spreading out- wards into the great wing, and down- wards into the external pterygoid plate. Each internal pterygoid plate is then formed, and becomes united to the external about the middle of foetal life. The two centres for the posterior part of the body appear as separate nuclei, side by side, beneath the sella Turcica; they join about the middle of foetal life into a single piece, which remains ununited to the rest of the bone until after birth. Each lesser wing is formed by a separate centre, which appears on the outer side of the optic foramen, at about the third month; they become united and join with the body at about the eighth month of foetal life. At about the end of the third year, ossification has made its appearance in the sphenoidal spongy bones. At birth, the sphenoid consists of three pieces; viz. the greater wing and pterygoid processes on each side; the lesser wings and body united. At the first year after birth, the greater wings and body are united. From the tenth to the twelfth year, the spongy bones are partially united to the sphenoid, their junction being complete by the twentieth year. Lastly, the sphenoid joins the occipital. Articulations, The sphenoid articulates with all the bones of the cranium, and five of the face; the two malar, two palate, and vomer: the exact extent of articu- lation with each bone is shewn in the accompanying figures.

The Sphenoidal Spongy Bones are two thin, curved plates of bone, which exist as separate pieces until puberty, and occasionally are not joined to the sphenoid in the adult. They are situated at the anterior and inferior part of the body of the sphenoid, an aperture of variable size being left in their anterior wall, through which the sphenoidal sinuses open into the nasal fossse. They are irre- gular in form, and taper to a point behind, being broader and thinner in front. Their inner surface, which looks towards the cavity of the sinus, is concave; their outer surface convex. Each bone articulates in front with the ethmoid, externally with the palate; behind, its point is placed above the vomer, and is received between the root of the pterygoid process on the outer side, and the rostrum of the sphenoid on the inner.

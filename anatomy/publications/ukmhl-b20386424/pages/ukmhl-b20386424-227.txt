191 KNEE-JOINT. 2. Knee-Jotnt. The knee is a ginglymoid, or hinge-joint; the bones entering into its formation are, the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front. The articular surfaces are covered with cartilage, and connected to- gether by ligaments, some of which are placed on the exterior of the joint, whilst others occupy its interior. External Ligaments.

The Anterior Ligament, or Ligamentum Patellce (fig. 139), is that portion of the common tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh which is continued from 139.—Right Knee-joint.

It is a strong, flat, ligamentous band, about three inches in length, attached, above, to the apex of the patella and the rough depression on its posterior surface; below, to the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia; its superficial fibres being continuous across the front of the patella with those of the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor. Two synovial bursas are connected with this ligament and the patella; one is inter- posed between the patella and the skin covering its anterior surface; the other, of small size, between the ligamentum patellas and the upper part of the tuberosity

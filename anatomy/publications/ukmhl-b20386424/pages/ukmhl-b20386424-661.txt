Around the necks of the teeth, this membrane presents numerous fine papillfB; and from this point it is reflected into the alveolus, where it is continuous with the periosteal membrane lining that cavity. The Teeth. The human subject is provided with two sets of teeth, which make their appearance at dilFerent periods of life. The first set appear in childhood, and are called the temporary^ deciduous^ or milk teeth. The second set, which also appear at an early period, continue until old age, and are named permanent. The temporary teeth are twenty in number; four incisors, two canine, and four molars, in each jaw. Th.Q permanent teeth are thirty-two in number; four incisors, two central and two lateral, two canine, four bicuspids, and six molars, in each jaw. General characters. Each tooth consists of three portions; the crown, or body, 320.â€”The Permanent Teeth. External View.

The roots of the teeth are firmly implanted within the alveoli: these depressions are lined with periosteum, which is reflected on to the tooth at the point of the fang, and covers it as far as the neck. At the margin of the alveolus, the periosteum becomes continuous with the fibrous structure of the gums.

66o THE THORAX. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. The Right Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculse. The sinus is the large quadrangular-shaped cavity, placed between the two venae cavaa: its walls are extremely thin, and it is connected below with the right 352.—The Right Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. ventricle, and internally, with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix auriculcE, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular pouch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and, from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two venae cavae. The following parts present themselves for examination: {Superior cava. Inferior cava. c ^ i • ^ . I Eustachian. Coronary smus. Valves \ p Foramina Thebesii. ' Auriculo-ventricular.

OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 325 making extension from the knee and ankle, the fragments may be brought into apposition. It is often necessary, however, in compound fracture, to remove a portion of the projecting bone with the saw before complete adaptation can be effected. Fracture of the JiTjula, with displace- ment of the tiUa (fig. 204), commonly 204.—Fracture of the Fibula, with Displacement known as 'Pott's Fracture,' is one of «f the Tibia.—'Pott's Fracture.' the most frequent injuries of the ankle- joint. The end of the tibia is displaced from the corresponding surface of the astragalus; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured; and the inner malleolus projects inwards beneath the integu- ment, which is tightly stretched over it, and in danger of bursting. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occasionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly connected below; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the ground, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flexing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making slight exten- sion from the knee and ankle.

Bowman, in the Cyclopedia of Anatomy ; and ' On the Minute Structure of Voluntary Muscle,' by the same author, in the Phil. Trans. 1840, 1841.

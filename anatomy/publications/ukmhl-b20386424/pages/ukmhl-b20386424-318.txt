MUSCLES AND FASCIiE 282 Relations. By its superficial surface, with the same parts as the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. By its deep surface, with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, the wrist, the radial vessels, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The Extensor Indicts is a narrow elongated muscle, placed on the inner side of, and parallel with, the preceding. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft ^ . n T> ,r 1 of the ulna, below the origin 175â€”Posterior Surface of the Fore-arm. Deep Muscles. Extensor secundi inter- nodii pollicis, and from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes with the Ex- tensor communis digitorum through the same canal in the annular ligament, and subse- quently joins that tendon of the Extensor communis which belongs to the index-finger, opposite the lower end of the corresponding metacarpal bone. It is finally inserted into the second and third pha- langes of the index-finger, in the manner already described. Relations. They are simi- lar to those of the preceding muscles. Nerves. The Supinator lon- gus. Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Anconeus, are supplied by branches from the musculo-spiral nerve. The remaining muscles of the ra- dial and posterior brachial regions, by the posterior interosseous nerve. Actions. The muscles of the radial and posterior bra- chial regions, which comprise all the Extensor and Supinator muscles, act upon the fore- arm, wrist, and hand; they are the direct antagonists of the Pronator and Flexor muscles. The Anconeus as- sists the Triceps in extending the fore-arm. The Supinator longus and brevis are the supinators of the fore-arm and hand; the former muscle more especially acting as a supina- tor when the limb is pronated. When supination has been produced, the Supinator lon- gus, if still continuing to act, flexes the fore-arm. The Ex- tensor carpi radialis longior and brevier, and Extensor carpi ulnaris muscles, are the

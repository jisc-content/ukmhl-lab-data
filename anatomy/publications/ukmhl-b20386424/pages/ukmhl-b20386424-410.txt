ARTERIES. 374 Muscuilo - Spirai Nerve 8.â€”The Surgical Anatomy of the Brachiial Artery, condyles of the humerus, which corresponds to the depression along the inner border of the Coraco- brachialis and Biceps muscles. In the upper part of its course, this vessel lies internal to the humerus; but below, it is in front of that bone. Relations. This artery is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered, in front, by the in- tegument, the superficial and deep fascios; the bicipital fascia separates it opposite the elbow from the me- dian basilic vein; the median nerve crosses it at its centre; and the basilic vein lies in the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia, in the lower half of its course. Behind, it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery inter- vening; and from the front of the bone below, by the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis and theBrachialis anticus muscles. By its outer side, it is in relation with the commence- ment of the median nerve, and the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles, which slightly overlap the artery. By its inner side, with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its upper half; the median nerve, its lower half. It is accompanied by two veins, the venae comites; they lie in close contact with the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating: branches.

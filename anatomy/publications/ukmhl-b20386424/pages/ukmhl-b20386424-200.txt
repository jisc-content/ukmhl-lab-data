ARTICULATIONS. 164 The Internal Lateral Ligament (fig. 122) is a long, thin, and loose band, attached above to the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the inner margin of the dental foramen.

The Stylo-maxillary lAgament is a thin apo- neurotic cord, which ex- tends from near the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone, to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw, between the Masseter and In- ternal pterygoid mus- cles. This ligament separates the parotid from the sub-maxillary gland, and has attached to its inner side, part of the fibres of origin of the Stylo-glossus muscle. Although usually classed among the ligaments of the jaw, it can only be considered as an accessory in the articulation. The Capsular Ligament consists of a thin and loose ligamentous capsule,

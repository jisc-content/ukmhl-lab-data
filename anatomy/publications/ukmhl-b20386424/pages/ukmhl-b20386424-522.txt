486 NERVOUS SYSTEM. raising and drawing back the optic commissure. A broad white band may be observed on each side, passing from the under surface of the corpus callosum backwards and outwards, to the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius; these bands are called the peduncles of the corpus callosum. Laterally, the corpus callosum extends into the anterior lobe. The lamina cinerea is a thin layer of grey substance, extending backwards from the termination of the corpus callosum above the optic commissure to the tuber cinereum; it is continuous on either side with the grey matter of. the anterior perforated space, and forms the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle. 265.â€”Base of the Brain. The olfactory nerve, with its bulb, is seen on either side of the longitudinal fissure, upon the under surface of each anterior lobe. The fissure of Sylvius separates the anterior and middle lobes, and lodges the middle cerebral artery. At its entrance is seen a point of medullary substance, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres, connecting the anterior and middle lobes, and called the fasciculus unciformis; on following this fissure out- wards, it divides into two branches, which enclose a triangular-shaped prominent cluster of isolated convolutions, the island of Reil. These convolutions, from being covered in by the sides of the fissure, are called the gyri operti.

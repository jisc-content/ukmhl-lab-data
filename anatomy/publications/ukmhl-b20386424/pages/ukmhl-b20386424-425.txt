COiLIAC AXIS. 389 C(ELiAC Axis. To expose this artery, raise the liver, draw down the stomach, and then tear through the layers of the lesser omentum. The Coeliac axis is a short thick trunk, about half an inch in length, arising from the aorta, opposite the margin of the Diaphragm, and passing nearly hori- zontally forwards (in the erect posture), divides into three large branches, the gastric, hepatic, and splenic, occasionally giving off one of the phrenic arteries. Relations. It is covered, by the lesser omentum. On the right side, it is in relation v^ith the right semilunar ganglion, and the lobus Spigelii. On the left side, wit\\ the right semilunar ganglion and cardiac end of the stomach. Below, it rests upon the upper border of the pancreas. 223.â€”The Coeliac Axis and its Branches, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum removed. The G-ASTRic Artery {Coronaria ventriciili), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes upwards and to the left side, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, distributing branches to the oesophagus, which anastomose with the aortic oesophageal arteries; others supply the cardiac end of the stomach, inoscu- lating with branches of the splenic artery: it then passes from left to right, along the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pylorus, lying in its course between the layers of the lesser omentum, and giving branches to both surfaces of the organ; at its termination it anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic.

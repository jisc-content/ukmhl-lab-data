ARTICULATIONS. Articulation of the Cartilages of the Ribs with each other. The cartilages of the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs articulate, by their lower borders, with the corresponding margin of the adjoining cartilages, by means of a small, smooth, oblong-shaped facet. Each articulation is enclosed in a thin capsular ligament, lined by synovial membrane, and strengthened extei-nally and internally by ligamentous fibres (intercostal ligaments), which pass from one cartilage to the other. Sometimes the cartilage of the fifth rib, more rarely that of the ninth, articulates, by its lower border, with the adjoining cartilage by a small oval facet; more frequently they are connected together by a few ligamentous fibres. Occasionally, the articular surfaces above mentioned are found wanting. Articulation of the Ribs with their Cartilages. The outer extremity of each costal cartilage is received into a depression in the sternal end of the ribs, and held together by the periosteum. 127.â€”Articulations of Pelvis and Hip. Anterior View. 8. Ligaments op the Sternum. The first and second pieces of the Sternum are united by a layer of cartilage which rarely ossifies, except at an advanced period of life. These two segments are connected by an anterior and posterior ligament. The anterior sternal ligament consists of a layer of fibres, having a longitudinal direction; it blends with the fibres of the anterior costo-sternal ligaments on both sides, and with the aponeurosis of origin of the Pectoralis major. This ligament is rough, irregular, and much thicker at the lower than at the upper part of this bone.

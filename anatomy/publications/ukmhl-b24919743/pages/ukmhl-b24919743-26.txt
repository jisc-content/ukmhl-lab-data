2 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. parts, but because of the light which it shecls on the seat, nature, and causes of the disease,—a light without which medicine would be little else than a blind empiricism.* Though anatomy is with perfect propriety included amongst the natural sciences, it differs altogether from zoology, both in its plan and object: the latter dwells on the external form and characters of organized bodies, the former, on the contrary, seeks to explore their interior, and resolves them into their component parts, in order to arrive at a know- ledge of their structure and properties. An opinion seems to be entertained by some persons, that the study of zoology and comparative anatomy should be considered rather as an amusement, than as a philoso- phical pursuit—as something calculated to employ light minds, or occupy hours of leisure and amusement. A slight examination will, however, suffice to shew that the facts it unfolds are not merely interesting; they will be found to be instructive in the highest degree, as they tend to throw considerable light on several obscure points connected with the anatomy of the human body, by affording the means of comparing the composition, arrangement, and properties of its different organs, with the corresponding parts in the lower animals. “ The varieties of organization supply in the investigation of each organ and its functions, the most important aids of analogy, comparison, contrast, and various combination ; the nature of the process receives, at each step, fresh elucidation, and the basis of our physiological principles is rendered broader and deeper, in proportion as our survey of living beings becomes more extensive.” More- over, the study of comparative anatomy forms a useful ex- ercise and discipline to the mind, by requiring a close at- tention to facts and principles, and the adoption by a clear and methodical arrangement. “ This advantage of distri- buting and classing a vast number of ideas, which belongs in a remarkable degree to natural history, has not yet been * Portal, Anatomie Midicale, preface, p. 1.

THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 39 requisites in what may be considered as the passive organs of locomotion. 24>. The short bones are usually situated in parts in which solidity and firmness are required to be combined with freedom of motion ; for instance, in the carpus, tarsus, and vertebral column. Their external conformation is neces- sarily influenced and determined by that of the parts into whose composition they enter, and as they are intended to co-operate in certain common functions, they present a number of articulating surfaces, prominences, and depres- sions, suited to their mode of adaptation and mutual con- nexion. 25. The flat or broad bones for the most part serve to form the walls of cavities, or to enclose spaces. They pre- sent two surfaces, one convex, and the other concave, which conformation, by giving them an arched form, in- creases their power of resistance, and affords additional se- curity to the organs they enclose. The bones of the skull and pelvis come under this denomination. Some are so irregular in their form as not to be referri- ble to either of these heads. These are situated along the median line, as the occipital, the sphenoid, and ethmoid bones, and the vertebrae. 26. In addition to these divisions into classes, adopted by all writers, those who treat expressly of descriptive anatomy are obliged to have recourse to others. Thus, in order to facilitate the description of irregular bones, such as the ethmoid, sphenoid, or vertebrae, they are considered as being divisible into a central part or body, and pro- cesses ; the anatomical situation of the parts forming the ground of division. In other instances it is supplied by the mode of development, as of the os innominatum into ilium, ischium, and os pubis. Finally, in some, the division is founded on the situation and uses of parts, as when the frontal bone is resolved into a frontal, nasal, and orbital portions.

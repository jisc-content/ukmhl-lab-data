ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS. 171 between their bases and the metacarpal bones ; it is there- fore unnecessary to repeat what has been just stated on that subject. 155. There are some other fibrous and ligamentous structures which deserve to be noticed in this place, not as being connected immediately with the joints; they are ra- ther accessories to the tendons of the muscles. Thus along the margins of the phalanges, on their palmar aspect, are attached the vaginal ligaments, which form sheaths for the flexor tendons, and bind them securely in their situa- tion ; these are thick and firm along the body of the pha- langes, but over the flexures of the joints they are thin, so as not to impede their movements ; their inner surface is lined by a fine membrane resembling the synovial class, which is reflected over the tendons, giving to each a smooth and shining appearance. 156. The posterior annular ligament of the wrist is con- tinuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, of which it may be considered a part. It extends from the extremity of the radius to the inner border of the ulna and the pisiforme bone, and serves to bind down the extensor tendons. 157. The anterior annular ligament is a dense fasciculus of fibres, extended across the carpus from the pisiform and unciform bones, to the trapezium and scaphoiâ€™des, so as to form a canal which transmits the flexor tendons, retains them in their situation, and modifies their direction and power of action on the hand. The Articulations of the Pelvis. 158. The os sacrum considered as the common point of support of the vertebral column above, the os coccygis be- low, and ossa innominata on each side, is connected with each of these in the following manner : 1. Sacro-vertebral articulation. The base of the sacrum is articulated with the last lumbar vertebra, by the same means as those which connect the different pairs of vertebrae

95 THE ULNA. the pronator teres ; inferiorly, to the pronator quadratus and the supinator radii longus ; whilst the posterior part of the bicipital tuberosity gives attachment to the biceps muscle. The Ulna. 62. Placed at the inner side of the fore-arm, the ulna is a long, rather irregular bone, larger at the upper than at the lower extremity. Its body, or middle part, is marked off into three surfaces, by three prominent lines. These are all broader above than below, in consequence of the de- creasing size of the bone. The anterior surface, slightly depressed, is grooved longitudinally for the origin of the flexor profundus, and marked at its upper third by a fo- ramen directed obliquely upwards for the medullary ves- sels. The internal surface, smooth and somewhat exca- vated superiorly, becomes round inferiorly, where it is subcutaneous. The external surface, rough and irregu- lar, is divided into two parts, of which one corresponds with the superior extremity of the bone, and forms an elon- gated depression for the anconeus muscle; the other, reach- ing to the lower extremity, gives origin to the extensors of the thumb and supinator radii brevis. Of the three mar- gins, the anterior and posterior are round, and for the most part smooth, the external is sharp, and gives attachment to the interosseous ligament. At the superior extremity are situated two eminences, so placed as to bound the articular cavity. Of these, one called olecranon (o\evr], ulna; Kpavtov, the head) is nearly on a line with the shaft of the bone; the other, the coronoidpro- cess (/copwvrj, a crows beak ; tlcoc, like), projects from its anterior surface. The olecranon terminates in a rough tu- berosity and an obtuse point, the former giving insertion to the triceps extensor, the latter being lodged, when the arm is extended, in the posterior cavity at the end of the hume- rus. Anteriorly, this process is concave and smooth; pos- teriorly, is a flat triangular surface, which is subcutaneous.

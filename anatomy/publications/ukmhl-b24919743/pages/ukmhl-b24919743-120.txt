ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 96 The coronoid process, prominent and pointed, is received during flexion into the anterior depression on the humerus; its anterior surface, rough and triangular, gives insertion to the brachialis anticus; the superior is smooth and exca- vated ; its inner border gives attachment to the internal la- teral ligament, the external is hollowed into a smooth de- pression, the smaller sigmoid, cavity, which articulates with the head of the radius. The great sigmoid cavity, formed by the junction of the smooth surfaces of these two pro- cesses, has been so named from some supposed resemblance to the Greek letter S {ouyya, etSog, like); but if viewed in profile, it much more nearly resembles the letter C. Covered by cartilage in its entire extent, it is divided into two parts by a middle angular ridge, the half cavities on each side of which are again subdivided by a transverse line, ending at each margin in a small notch. At the inferior extremity, which is very small, are situated two eminences, of which the external one, named the head of the ulna, round and covered with cartilage, corresponds inferiorly with the tri- angular fibro-cartilage of the wrist joint, and externally is received into a cavity on the contiguous border of the ra- dius. The internal eminence, named the styloid process, on a line with the posterior surface of the bone, and elon- gated in its form, gives attachment to the internal lateral li- gament of the joint. These processes are separated poste- riorly by a groove, which is traversed by the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris, and inferiorly by a depression into which the triangular fibro-cartilage is inserted. Attachments of Muscles. The anterior surface, superiorly, and in the middle, gives attachment to the flexor digitorum pro- fundus ; inferiorly, to the pronator quadratus : the posterior surface, to the anconeus, the extensor carpi ulnaris, supina- tor radii brevis, the extensores pollicis, and the extensor indicis; by the posterior longitudinal line, to an aponeurosis common to the flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum profun- dus, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The superior extremity, by

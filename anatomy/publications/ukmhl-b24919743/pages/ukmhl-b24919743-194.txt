170 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. palmar surface, a similar mode of connexion exists, but the fibres are not so well defined. The carpal extremities of the four last metacarpal bones, are bound together by three transverse fibrous bands on the palmar, and the same on the dorsal surface, passing from one to the other; they are very slight, and often ill- defined. The digital extremities of these bones are connected at their palmar aspect by a flat band passing across them, and closely connected with the head of each; this is called the transverse ligament. 151. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is articulated on quite a different principle from the others ; for as it ad- mits of all the motions, except rotation, it is connected to the trapezium by a capsular ligament, which passes from the rough border, bounding its articular surface to the trapezium ; these parts are lined by a synovial membrane. The Articulation of the Flialanges with the Metacarpal Bones. 152. The rounded head of each of the four last metacarpal bones being received into the slight concavity situated in the extremity of the first phalanx, is maintained in situ by two lateral ligaments, an anterior ligament and a synovial membrane. 153. The lateral ligaments consist of dense fasciculi of fibres, attached by one extremity to the sides of the metacar- pal bones, by the other to the contiguous extremity of the phalanges, the direction of the fibres being forwards and downwards. The anterior ligaments occupy the interval between these on the palmar aspect of the joints ; they are thin and membranous. The synovial membrane invests the surfaces of the heads of the bones, and is reflected on the ligaments which connect them. 154. The phalanges are articulated with one another, on the same principle as that which obtains in the articulation

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 398 Section II. THE ARTERIES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 418. The arterial trunk, which supplies the upper extre- mity, continues undivided from its commencement, as far as the bend of the elbow; but, like that of the lower extremity, different parts of it have received different names, accord- ing to the regions in which they are seated. Whilst in relation with the clavicle, which comprises all that part of the vessel intercepted between its commencement and the lower border of the first rib, it is called subclavian ; from the point just indicated, to the border of the axilla, it is named axillary, and from thence to the bend of the elbow brachial. This mode of division is analogous to that of the inferior arterial trunk into iliac, femoral, and popliteal, and the analogy is completed by the fact, that as the one ulti- mately divides into the tibial and fibular branches, so does the other into ulnar and radial. As the subclavian artery commences on the left side, at the arch of the aorta, and on the right, at the division of the innominata, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation, the vessels of opposite sides must differ materially in length and relations to contiguous parts in the first part of their course. They both agree, however, in arching upwards and outwards across the lower part of the neck, and in descending beneath the clavicle and subclavius muscle, after which they assume the name of axillary. We shall commence the description of the arteries of the upper extremity with that of the vessel last named, and shall reserve, until we have examined the cer- vical region, any further mention of the subclavian artery. 419. The axillary artery (arteria axillaris) lies obliquely across the superior and lateral part of the thorax, extend- ing from the lower border of the first rib, as far as the infe- rior margin of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres

VEINS OE THE UPPER EXTREMITIES. 413 with the anterior ulnar cutaneous vein. The vein last named commences upon the anterior surface of the wrist, and thence ascends along the fore-arm, communicating by branches with the median vein on the one hand, and the posterior ulnar cutaneous on the other. At the bend of the elbow it unites with the posterior ulnar cutaneous vein, and also with the median basilic, so as to form a trunk called the median basilic vein. This is usually of consi- derable size; it ascends along the inner side of the fore- arm, and finally terminates in the axillary vein, or in one of the venae comites of the brachial artery. 428. The median vein results from the union, on the an- terior part of the fore-arm, of several branches. It is a short trunk, which serves as a means of communication be- tween the ulnar and radial veins on each side, as well as between the superficial and deep veins of the arm. Its length is subject to many varieties, it terminates by dividing into branches, which diverge at an angle, one inclining in- wards to join the basilic vein, and thence called median ba- silic, the other, outwards, to end in the cephalic vein, and named, on that account, median cephalic. 429. The axillary vein, formed by the union of the ba- silic vein and the venae comites, inclines upwards and in- wards, receiving, as above stated, the cephalic vein, and also small veins corresponding with the different branches of the axillary artery. It passes between the clavicle and first rib, lying on the origin of the anterior scalenus muscle, which separates it from the subclavian artery, and, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation, unites with the internal jugular vein, to form the vena innominata. The part of the vessel intercepted between the first rib and the latter point is called the subclavian vein.

481 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. downwards, resting on the pleura and first rib. The vein lies on a plane, anterior to the artery, being separated from it by the scalenus an- ticus, but is somewhat lower down, so as not to obscure or overlap it, except when much distended. Previously to reaching the scalenus the artery is covered by the skin and fascia, by the origin of the sterno-mastoi’d and the platisma, and is overlapped by the sterno-hyoideus and sterno-thyroideus muscles ; it is also crossed by the ner- vus vagus and jugular vein ; but external to the scalenus, though still deeply seated, it is covered only by the skin, platisma, and fascia, with some cellular membrane, and will be found lodged in a tri- angular interval, the base of which is formed by the cla- vicle, and the sides by the scalenus and omo-hyoideus. This is the situation in which the artery can be most easily compressed or ligatured. wards, behind the scalenus, and thenceforward follows the same course, and main- tains the same relations as the right subclavain. But up to that point it lies so deeply, and changes its course so suddenly when passing outwards behind the scalenus, that it is found im- possible to apply a ligature upon it previously to reach- ing that muscle,—an opera- tion which has been per- formed with success on the corresponding part of the right subclavian. 535. Seven branches proceed from the subclavian artery, each to a different destination; three of these, however, arise by a common trunk. 2 r

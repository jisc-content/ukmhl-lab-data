90 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The Humerus. 60. This bone, placed between the scapula and fore-arm, is long and irregularly cylindrical in its form, and divisible into a body and two extremities. The body, thick and rounded superiorly, is somewhat expanded, and triangular inferiorly. It is divided into two nearly equal surfaces by two longitudinal lines, of which one is external and an- terior, the other internal and posterior. These lines may be considered as arising, the former from the external, the latter from the internal condyle, near to which they are well marked, but gradually subside as they proceed up- wards on the body of the bone ; they afford attachment to the inter-muscular aponeuroses. The external one is inter- rupted about the middle by a slight depression, or groove, marking the course of the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery; the surfaces thus separated are named pos- terior and anterior. The posterior surface is round supe- riorly, and inclined a little inwards; in the lower part it is broad, flat, and turned outwards ; it is covered in the entire of its extent by the triceps extensor muscle, and towards its middle may be observed a small foramen for the medullary vessels. The anterior surface is divided into two unequal portions by a longitudinal groove, directed obliquely down- wards and inwards, for about one-fourth of the length of the bone; this lodges the long tendon of the biceps muscle, and is therefore named the bicipital groove; its anterior margin gives attachment to the pectoralis major, the poste- rior to the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The part of the anterior surface which is internal to this groove, is smooth in the greater part of its extent, and presents, to- wards its middle, a linear elevation for the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and lower down an oblique medullary fo- ramen ; but on the external part of the same surface, may be observed a broad rough eminence for the insertion of

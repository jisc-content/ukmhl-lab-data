G22 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. . (corpora restiformia, pi/ramides posterieures). The largest of the fasciculi here referred to are the crura cerebel/i, which are concealed within the lobes, and even when about to emerge from their substance they are overlapped by some minor lobules. They incline forwards and inwards, descending somewhat, and become continuous with the fibres of the pons Varolii, which are thus derived from the crura cerebelli. The poos, from its mode of formation, bears the same relation to the cerebellum that the corpus callosum does to the cerebrum, as it is composed of converging fibres, and may therefore be called a com- missure. fiOG. The cerebellum incloses a cavity called the fourth ventricle, the roof of which is formed by the valve of Vieussens, and processus ad testes, the sides by the lobes of the cerebellum; the dorsal surface of the medulla ob- longata forms its floor, and it is completed inferiorly by a reflection of the arachnoid membrane : a process of pia mater projects into it at this situation, called choroides minor. If a vertical section be made of one of the lobes of the cerebellum, in such a way as that two-thirds of its breadth shall lie external to the incision, an oval nucleus of grey substance (corpus dentatum, vel rhornboideum) will be exposed ; its texture is usually firm, and its border notched, so as to give it a dentated appearance. Gall considers it as a ganglion of increase to the formative fibres of the cerebellum. The surface of the section here indicated presents rather a peculiar appearance: the white substance will be found so disposed as to represent the stalk and branches of a tree, hence called (arbor vita.) The branches project into the folia of the cerebellum, and the grey substance invests them so as to resemble penna- tifid leaves. If a horizontal section be made, so as to divide the lobe into two equal parts, the quantity of white substance will appear considerably greater than that of the grey.

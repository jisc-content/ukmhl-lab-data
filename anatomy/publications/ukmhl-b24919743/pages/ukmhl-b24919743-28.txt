4 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. that if a subject carry within itself any degree of complexity, there is no course more likely to lessen it, than that â€œ of pro- ceeding from things more simple, to those more compound- ed and if this principle be applied to the subject just al- luded to, we shall find, that so far from rendering it more difficult, it will remove from it even the appearance of diffi- culty. When we examine an organ in its simplest form, we at once ascertain its essential or fundamental consti- tuent ; and if we trace it through the different grades of animals, from the lowest to the highest in the series, we can readily recognize each of the accessory parts which are successively superadded, and assign to them respectively the rank which they fill, and the duties they perform. 4. The simplest form of auditory apparatus is a small sac containing a fluid, and enclosing the sentient extremity of the auditory nerve. Its exterior envelope is fibrous in the lower animals, cartilaginous in others, and finally osseous in the higher orders; it presents two apertures, placed at opposite points of its circumference, of which the internal one serves to transmit the acoustic nerve, while the other maintains the relation with the external world: and as the sac is analogous to the vestibule in the higher animals, these openings may be said to correspond, the one with the meatus auditorius internus, the other with the fenestra ovalis. Within this first investment is placed a vascular membrane, which lines it throughout, and encloses and supports the nerve: this, however, does not seem to be expanded to the same extent as the nervous membrane of the eye ; still, like the retina, it is in immediate contact with a fluid which bears some analogy to the vitreous humour, for each is enclosed in a membrane which enables it to retain its form, and prevents it from being diffused in the cavity in which it is lodged; and both serve as media of transmis- sion for the appropriate agents of impression. This simple apparatus is covered over by the cranial integuments, and as they exclude all contact with the medium in which the

vesicul^e seminales. 533 finally, having pierced the prostate, it opens into the urethra at the side of the verumontanum. 593. The vesiculce seminales are two narrow, membranous sacks, placed along the base of the bladder, and extended obliquely from the ureters to the base of the prostate. Their breadth is not more than three or four lines, their length two inches. They converge anteriorly, and diverge behind, so as to include between them an angular space In which the bladder rests immediately on the rectum. Each vesicula is convoluted, so as to appear much shorter than it really is, and consists of two lamellae, the exterior one being dense and firm, whilst the internal is in every respect similar to mucous membrane, and thrown into folds, so as to divide the cavity into cells. The anterior extremity of the vesicula ends in a narrow tube, which unites with the vas deferens, forming a common duct {ductus ejaculatorius). This will be found to run obliquely forwards, lying in the fissure between the middle and lateral lobe of the prostate, then between the latter and the mucous membrane, which it pierces at the side of the verumontanum. Female Organs of Generation. 594. The genital organs in the female are divisible, like those of the male, into two classes: 1, those of formation {organa generationis, vel formationis), consisting of the ovaries, uterus, and Fallopian tubes; and 2, those of copu- lation, viz. the vagina and vulva. We commence with the latter, as they are usually first examined. 595. Vulva, or pudendum, is a general term, which is considered as including all the parts perceptible externally. 1. Mens Veneris. The integument on the forepart of the pubic symphysis is slightly elevated by a quantity of cellular and adipose substance deposited beneath it, and studded with hair. This part, from its surmounting the labia, has been called mons Veneris. 2. The labia pudendi extend downwards from the mons, gradually becoming thinner as

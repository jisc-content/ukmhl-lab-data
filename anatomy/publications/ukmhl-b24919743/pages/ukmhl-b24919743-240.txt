216 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Form—elongated. It arises from the posterior part of the tuber ischii, close to the inner side of the biceps, and con- tinues to arise from the tendon of that muscle for three inches lower down, somewhat in the same way as the co- raco brachialis does from the biceps of the arm. A little below the middle of the thigh it ends in a long round ten- don, which passing along the inner side of the popliteal space, is reflected forwards, to be inserted into the inside of the upper part of the tibia, about two inches below its tuberosity, where the tendon is on the same plane, and beneath that of the gracilis. Direction—nearly vertical: structure—as its name implies, fleshy in half its extent, tendinous in the rest: relations—its posterior surface, ex- cept where it is slightly overlapped by the biceps, is covered by the fascia lata, the anterior surface rests on the semi- membranosus in part of its extent, the adductor magnus in the rest, its insertion is covered by that of the sartorius. 236. The semi - membranosus, (iscliio -popliti - tibial, Chauss.) is situated obliquely at the posterior and inner part of the thigh. It arises from the posterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the biceps and semi- tendinosus, and behind the quadratus femoris, and is in- serted by three portions, of which the middle one is fixed to the tibia, behind its inner tuberosity, and sends an expansion which covers the popliteus muscle, the internal poi’tion passes forwards under the internal lateral ligament, and is inserted along the side of the inner tuberosity of the femur; the third, broad and expanded, is reflected backwards and upwards behind the joint, and is inserted into the external condyle of the femur, becoming identified with the liga- mentum posticum. Direction—nearly vertical: structure— fleshy in the middle,tendinous at its extremities: relations— by the posterior surface with the biceps, semi-membranosus and fascia lata ; by the anterior surface with the quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, the popliteal artery, inner head of the gastrocnemius and knee joint, by the inner border with

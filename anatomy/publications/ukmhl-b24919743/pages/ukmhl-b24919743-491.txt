"The papilla lenticulares, which vary in number from ten to fifteen, are disposed in two lines, converging to an angle just before the foramen coecum. They are rounded on their free surface, and resemble so many in- verted cones, their summits being embedded in the substance of the tongue. 2. The papilla: capitatce, velfungiformes, are more numerous than the preceding, and also smaller. They are placed, for the most part, towards the borders and point of the tongue. They present each a rounded lieadj supported by a short, thin pedicle. 3. Papilla co- nicce vel pyramidales, are much more numerous than the others, and are diffused over the whole of the dorsum of the tongue from the lenticular papillae to its point. They are minute and tapering. A fourth class has been recog- nized by some persons (papilla jiliformes), but they are very few, and placed close to the apex of the tongue. The papillae of the three last classes consist of the ultimate terminations of the gustatory nerve, surrounded by a deli- cate vascular plexus, and supported by cellular tissue. 481. Between the arches of the soft palate, on each side, is lodged an elongated, oval structure, (amygdala, tonsil,) which seems to be composed of a great number of mucous follicles aggregated together into a mass, about the size of an almond, whence its name is derived. Its internal sur- face presents several small apertures, which lead into folli- cles, or cells, that secrete a mucous, and viscid fluid. It is of a reddish grey colour, and exceedingly vascular. The Larynx. 482. The larynx, or organ of voice, is placed at the fore- part of the neck, beneath the os hyoides, above the tra- chea, and forming that prominence called “ pomum Adami.” It is broad above, narrow inferiorly, its cartilaginous wall 2 G

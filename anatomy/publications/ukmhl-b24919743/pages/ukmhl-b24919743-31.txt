INTRODUCTION. 7 a geographer would be of the extent and resources of a kingdom, were he to limit his inquiries to a single province or department. 6. Human anatomy may be studied in two different con- ditions of the structures of the body, and so may be directed to two distinct objects. By the one a knowledge of the healthy condition of parts is sought to be attained; by the other, of their morbid characters, and on this distinction is founded the division of the subject into two sections or departments, viz. healthy, or descriptive anatomy, and morbid, or pathological. The changes of structure in- duced by disease can only be ascertained by an exami- nation of the body after death; but though a knowledge of these changes is confessedly a matter of importance, it can only be brought into practical application when they are connected with the alteration of functions, or the symptoms which had accompanied them during life. When by repeated and accurate examinations the different struc- tural lesions of each organ are fully investigated, and their appropriate symptoms so clearly ascertained, that they are made to bear to one another the relation of sign and thing signified, the diagnosis of diseases may be considered as established on a basis sufficiently ex- tended to warrant us in resting upon it our curative indi- cations. It may be here observed that anatomy, in the original and literal acceptation of the term, merely served to denote one of the methods of examination used by those who ap- plied to the cultivation of the science. It consisted in the dis- section of parts, which required no more than a scalpel for its execution, and sufficed for all the purposes sought to be attained during the earlier periods of the history of medi- cine. But as the objects of pursuit became multiplied, the methods of examination were necessarily varied, and seve- ral other processes were from time to time introduced,

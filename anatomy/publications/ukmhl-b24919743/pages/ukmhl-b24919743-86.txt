ELEMENTS OF ANATOMV. 62 The superior extremity, or base, broad and expanded, presents, 1st, towards the middle line an oval surface, cutoff obliquely, and tipped with cartilage for its articulation with the last lumbar vertebra; behind this is a triangular aper- ture marking the orifice of the sacral canal. 2d. On each side a smooth convex surface, inclined forwards, and continu- ous with the iliac fossae ; an articular process, concave from side to side, which looks backwards and inwards, and re- ceives the inferior articular process of the last lumbar ver- tebra; this is bounded anteriorly by a groove, forming part of the last inter-vertebral foramen, and posteriorly, by a sharp border, corresponding with the lateral arches of the vertebras, and giving attachment to the last ligamentum subflavum. The inferior extremity, or apex, directed downwards, pre- sents an oval convex surface, which articulates with the coccyx. The sacrum gives attachment, by the lateral part of its anterior surface, to the pyramidalis muscle; by its posterior surface to the gluteus maximus, sacro-lumbalis, and latissimus dorsi; by the inferior part of each border to the coccygeus. The Ossa Coccygis. 42. These, in the adult, are usually found separate, but in old age often united into one. They diminish gradually in size from above downwards, which gives them, when taken together, a pyramidal form. As they are placed in a continuous line with the inferior third of the sacrum, they form a concave surface anteriorly, a convex one pos- teriorly. The first of these bones resembles, in some measure, the last false vertebra of the sacrum. Its body, or central part, is small; but, posteriorly and on each side, two small eminences, termed cornua, project, which articulate with the extremity of the sacrum. The second bone of the coccyx is somewhat square; the last elongated.

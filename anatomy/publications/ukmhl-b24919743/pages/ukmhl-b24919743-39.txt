15 INTRODUCTION. There is also another class of books in very geneiâ€™al use, denominated Manuals of Anatomy, written by Messrs. Scratchley, Green, Bell, Shaw, and Stanley. These have been formed for the most part on the plan adopted by the writers on surgical anatomy, and have been found pro- ductive of considerable advantage to students during the earlier periods of their pursuits. Notwithstanding the ex- istence of so many works in this department of medical lite- rature, it is now very generally admitted that there is still room for another. The present work comprises the sub- stance of the courses of Anatomical Demonstrations, de- livered by the Author at the Medical School, Aldersgate- street, and has been arranged according to the same plan, at least there has been no other deviation, except what was required by the obvious difference between a course of oral lectures, and a written book. Instead of examining each system of organs separately, instead of passing in re- view the whole skeleton in the first place, then proceeding to the muscles, and afterwards going the round of the vas- cular and nervous systems, the author has adopted the practice of commencing with a particular part, usually the lower extremity, and of examining its composition in the following way: 11. The osseous structure, considered as the fundamen- tal part of the limb, is described first, inasmuch as it gives form and solidity to the whole, and constitutes the substra- tum, to which the others are, as it were, applied. As the osseous part is divided into several pieces, differing from one another in form and size, and as these are united toge- ther by certain means of connexion so constructed, as to admit of various degrees of motion between the parts, the consideration of the joints or articulations, and of the tex- tures which enter into their formations, in the next place engages attention. The bones, with their ligamentous con- nexions, constitute together the passive instruments of loco- motion, the active agents in progression, as well as in the

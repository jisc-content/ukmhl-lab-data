47 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. any perceptible boundary or distinction, and the fibrous en- velope passes uninterruptedly over the entire surface, but the femur, tibia, clavicle, and humerus, are quite distinct and accurately defined ; the latter, it will be recollected, are ultimately to be connected by ligaments, and contribute to form the moveable articulations, the former still continue to be united by cartilage. About the eighth week the carti- lage, which for a certain time, more or less in different in- stances, occupies the place and performs the functions of bone, becomes hollowed into irregular cavities, and shortly afterwards into canals lined by vascular membranes, and filled by a mucilaginous or viscid fluid; at this period a red dot appears at some particular point, and ossification immediately commences. The spot first ossified (punctum ossificationis) is always situated within the substance of the cartilage, never at its surface. Bichat was of opinion that the vessels were not developed at this period ; that they existed before, but circulated only white fluids, and then for the first time begin to admit red globules; but be that as it may, the change is marked by the admission of blood into the interior of the cartilage, and the deposition of calca- reous matter, both appearing to be coincident. The carti- lage appears red and injected, where it is in close contact with the ossified points; more externally it is somewhat opaque, and marked by grooves or canals; in the next re- move it retains its original character, presenting hovrever, in a few points, some vascular canals directed towards the centre of ossification. As the process proceeds, the osseous point increases, as well by additions externally, as by in- terstitial depositions, whilst the cartilage, as it becomes ex- cavated by canals and cavities lined by vascular lamellae, diminishes gradually as the bone increases, and finally dis- appears, being as it were supplanted. Though this is to be considered merely as an outline of the process of ossification, we cannot enter farther into the subject, as it would lead us too much into detail to enume-

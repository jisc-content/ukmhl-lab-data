VASCULAR SYSTEMâ€”THE PULSE. 603 artery was tightened at each contraction of the heart. It appears, then, that the weight of testimony and authority inclines to that opinion which attributes the pulse to a dilatation and elongation of the artery, synchronous with the systole of the ventricles. It cannot be said to be actually dependent on that cause, for if it were, no difference could exist in the state of the pulse in the cor- responding arteries in different limbs, neither could it be raised above par, as we frequently find it, in a vessel leading to an in- flamed part, nor depressed below it in a paralytic limb.

Gelatine consists of . 47*88 27*20 27*20 Albumen .... 52*883 7*540 23*872 Fibrine .... 53*360 7*021 19*685 Azote. 17*00 15*705 19*934 Gelatine, or animal jelly, is an abundant ingredient, not only in the fluids, but also in the solid parts of the body, as is evident from the fact, that by boiling, it can be ex- tracted from skin, membrane, ligament, cartilage, and bone. The solution on cooling forms a tremulous mass, and if the aqueous part be dissipated by heat, the remain- der becomes brittle, and breaks with a vitreous fracture; this is named animal glue. Gelatine is soluble in pure li- quid alkalies, and is not precipitated from them by acids; this latter property distinguishes it from albumen, fibrine, and other animal products, and points out the method of separating it from them; its most active precipitant is tannin, with which it forms an insoluble compound. Albumen, next to gelatine, is the most abundant con- stituent of animal substances. It is found in the blood, in several secreted fluids, such as chyle, synovia, &c. and forms a principal basis of some solids,of cellular membrane, skin, and glands. Its appearance is that of a viscid trans- parent fluid, without taste or smell, which may be coa- gulated by the action of heat and of alcohol. Fibrine forms the basis of the muscular structure, and by ablution with water may be obtained free from all the more soluble parts, except some albumen, which adheres to it. It is insoluble in water or acids; but is completely dissolved by the caustic fixed alkalies. Fibrine, when pure, is destitute of taste or smell, of a pale colour, elastic, and divisible into filaments. It is obtained in considerable quantity from the crassamentum of blood, and may be re- cognised also in chyle. Mucus is the viscid fluid which lubricates the mouth, nares, oesophagus, alimentary canal, and all the tubes and

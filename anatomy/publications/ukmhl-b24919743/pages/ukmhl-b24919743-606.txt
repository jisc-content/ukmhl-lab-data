562 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. to our present purpose):â€”A grooved staff, corresponding in size with that of the urethra, is in the first place introduced, and so placed, that its concavity lies close beneath the pubic arch, whilst its convexity is turned somewhat towards the left side of the perinseum. The edge of the scalpel is then laid on the skin, close by the left side of the raphe, at about fourteen lines before the margin of the anus, and is thence drawn downwards and outwards to the interval between the margin of the anus and the left tuber ischii, inclining a little nearer to the latter: this divides the skin and superficial fascia. The second incision, commencing a quar- ter of an inch, or a little more, according to the size of the bulb, below the upper end of the first, is carried downwards in the same direction and extent, and so divides the lower fibres of the accelerator muscle, the transversalis perinsei muscle and artery, with part of the levator ani and deep perinaeal fascia. The staff should now be sought for at the upper angle of the incision: if the bulb be large, it will be necessary to press it aside with the index finger of the left hand. The point of the scalpel being ele- vated, by depressing its handle, and throwing the hand a little back, it is made to enter the groove of the staff, its lodgement therein being ensured by moving it slightly from side to side, and then is passed along the groove, so as to lay open the mem- branous part of the urethra. When this has been effected, the operator draws downwards to himself the handle of the staff (its concavity being held securely beneath the pubic arch), by.which means its beak is made to move upwards and backwards, and so removed from the rectum. Whilst this is being done, the scalpel (previously lateralized, so that the direction of its edge shall cor- respond with that of the external incision) is made to slide along the groove, dividing in its passage the prostatic part of the urethra and of the neck of the bladder. After this has been completed, the scalpel is withdrawn a little, and carried obliquely downwards in the direction of the first incision, so as to divide any septa that may lie across the wound, which usually consist of part of the fibres of the levator ani, and of the transversus perinaei, if not severed in the second incision. The advantage, or rather the necessity, of freely dividing the membranous part of the urethra, previously to de- pressing the staff, has been put in a very clear point of view by

78 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Attachments of Muscles. The internal surface, by its anterior portion, to the extensor communis digitorum, extensor pro- prius pollicis, and peroneus tertius, by the depression on its posterior part to the tibialis posticus ; the external surface, to the peronei ; the posterior surface, to the soleus and flexor longus pollicis ; its head, to the biceps flexor cruris. The Bones of the Foot. The foot is composed, like the hand, of three parts, viz. the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes. The Tarsus. The tarsus is composed of seven bones, viz. the os calcis, astragalus, naviculare, cuneiforme internum, cuneiforme medium, cuneiforme externum, and cuboides. The Os Calcis. 52. This bone is situated at the posterior and inferior part of the tarsus, and forms the heel by its projection backwards ; elongated in that direction and compressed la- terally, it is the largest of the bones of the foot. Supe- riorly it presents from behind forwards, a concave portion, intervening between the insertion of the tendo Achillis into its posterior border, and the surface which articulates with the astragalus; then the last named surface, which is bound- ed by a rough depression for the insertion of a ligament (interosseous) and lastly a narrow concave surface, which also articulates with the astragalus. On the inferior surface, which is narrower than the preceding, and broader behind than before, are observed posteriorly two eminences (the internal being the larger) serving for the attachment of muscles ; between them a depression for the origin of the long plantar ligament, and in front another eminence, giv- ing attachment to the inferior ligament connecting this bone with the naviculare. The anterior surface, the smallest, is slightly concave, and articulates with the cuboid bone. The

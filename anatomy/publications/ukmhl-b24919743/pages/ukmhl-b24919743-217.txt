193 TRANSVERSALIS —CREMASTER. Poupart’s ligament, from the crista ilei for two thirds of its length, also from an aponeurosis (fascia lumborum) pro- longed backwards to the lumbar vertebrae. From these points, the fibres pass with different degrees of obliquity, to be inserted as follows: those from Poupart’s ligament arch downwards and inwards, to be fixed into the crista of the pubis, and also for some way into the pectineal line, cohjointly with those of the transversalis muscle: or, more strictly, into Gimbernat’s ligament, where it is inserted into that line. The fibres, from the anterior part of the crista ilei, pass horizontally inwards, whilst the rest ascend obliquely, and terminate, some in an aponeurosis expanded in front of the abdomen, the rest at the inner margin of the cartilages of the six last ribs, on a plane corresponding with the intercostal muscles. The aponeurosis, on reach- ing the outer border of the rectus muscle, divides into two lamellae, one passing before, the other behind it, so as to enclose it in a sheath. Direction—obliquely upwards and inwards in the greater part of its extent; some of its fibres are horizontal, the rest are arched downwards : structure— fleshy at the sides, aponeurotic anteriorly, and also poste- riorly, where it becomes connected with the lumbar ver- tebrae : relations—by one surface with the obliquus exter- nus, by the other with the transversalis ; anteriorly with the rectus and pyramidalis, which its aponeurosis serves to in- close, posteriorly with the latissimus dorsi and the deep- seated lumbar muscles. 204. The cremaster. Though the cremaster, or suspen- sory muscle of the testis does not form a part of the abdo- minal parietes, its description usually follows that of the internal oblique in consequence of the intimate connexion which subsists between them. It is ordinarily said to arise from the inner surface of Poupart’s ligament, and from the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, a few fibres also appearing to come from the transversalis; from these origins the fibres pass downwards on the spermatic

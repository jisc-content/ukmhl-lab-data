ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 204 the base of the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera, imme- diately behind the insertion of the pectineus. Direction— the same as the adductor longus: strucltire—fleshy, ex- cept at its attachments, which are aponeurotic: relations— by the anterior surface with the pectineus, and adductor longus; by the posterior, with the adductor magnus; by the external border with the obturator externus, and the tendon of the psoas and iliacus; by the inner border, with the gracilis, in part of its extent, the rest being concealed between the two other adductors. This muscle is pierced by some of the perforating branches of the profunda ar- tery. 221. The adductor magnus (grand adducteur, Bichat; ischio-femoral, Chauss.; ischio-pubio-femoral, Dumas) is situated at the posterior and inner part of the thigh; it arises from the ramus of the pubis, and that of the is- chium, also from the border of the tuberosity of the latter bone. The muscular fibres diverge from their origin, some- what like the ribs of a fan from their central pivot, those from the pubis, shorter than the rest, pass transversely out- wards, and are inserted into the rough line prolonged from the linea aspera to the linea quadrata; others pass with va- rying degrees of obliquity downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the whole length of the linea aspera, and a small part of its internal bifurcation, where they end in a pointed process; finally, some of the fibres descend almost vertically, forming the inner border of the muscle, and ter- minate in a rounded tendon, which is inserted into the tu- berosity on the inner condyle of the femur. The muscle thus presents two parts, one a flat broad plane, inserted into the linea aspera, and forming a septum between the anterior and posterior muscles of the thigh; the other being the elongated part which goes to the condyle. Between these an angular interval is left for the trans- mission of the femoral vessels backwards into the pop- liteal space. Direction—the fibres pass obliquely from

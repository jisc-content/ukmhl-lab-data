THE OS INNOMINATUM. 63 Attachments of Muscles. The coccyx gives attachment to the gluteus maximus, to the coccygeus, and by its point to the sphincter ani. The Os Innominatum. 43. To facilitate the description of this very irregular bone, it is convenient to consider separately each of the parts into which it is found divided in early life, viz. the ileum, os pubis, and ischium. The ileum, or superior, and expanded part of the bone, is broad, flat, somewhat triangular in its form, and situ- ated at the superior and lateral part of the pelvis. Its sur- faces, borders, and angles, must be considered successively. The external surface, convex before, concave posteriorly, is marked by two curved lines running from before back- wards, the superior being the longer. On its superior and posterior part is observed a rough surface, which gives at- tachment to the gluteus maximus muscle. The internal surface is divided into three parts. One anterior, smooth, and concave, is called the iliac fossa, the other posterior, is rough, and serves for its articulation with the sacrum, whilst the third is smooth, much smaller than the others, and is the only part that enters into the formation of the true pelvis. The superior border, extending from before backwards, is somewhat arched ; it forms an epiphysis in infancy, and is sometimes called the spine of the ileum, but more properly its crista; its anterior extremity curves inwards, the poste- rior outwards. This border presents an external and in- ternal lip, and a rough interval, to each of which muscles are attached. The anterior border, depressed and excavated, descends from the superior border towards the pubis, with which it is continuous; its junction with the former is marked by a prominent point, called the anterior superior spinous pro- cess ; and that with the latter, by a slight eminence common

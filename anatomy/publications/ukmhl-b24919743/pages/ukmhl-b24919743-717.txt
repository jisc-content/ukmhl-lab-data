671 THE EYE. the lumbar nerves. In the pelvis there are usually five ganglia, connected like the rest of the series : the last pair lie closely together in front of the coccyx; sometimes there appears to be but a single ganglion, to which both nerves converge. From the outer side of each ganglion filaments of communication pass to the sacral nerves ; from the inner side several join the hypogastric plexus, which is derived chiefly from the inferior mesenteric plexus. The pelvic viscera receive an abundant supply of nerves from this interlacement. Of the Globe of the Eye. 707. The globe of the eye is situated at the internal and anterior part of the orbital fossa, which lodges it and its appendages : its form is that of a spheroid, slightly com- pressed at the four opposite points of its circumference, which correspond with the insertion of the recti muscle. The direction of the globe does not correspond with that of the orbit; the axes of the eyes are parallel with one another, whilst those of the orbits diverge considerably in front, and if prolonged backwards would decussate behind the body of the sphenoid bone, hence as the optic nerves co- incide in their direction with that of the axes of the orbits, each of them must enter the globe of the corresponding eye to the inner side of its axis, and consequently of the axis of vision. When viewed in profile the globe appears to be composed of segments of two spheres, of which the anterior is smaller and more prominent; hence, when its different diameters are compared, it will be found that the antero-posterior exceeds the others by about a line. An- teriorly the globe of the eye is in relation with the conjunc- tiva, which is reflected from the eye-lids upon it;—poste- riorly with the vessels and nerves (optic and ciliary) which enter it, and with a quantity of adipose substance, in which it is in some measure embedded, round its circumference, with the six muscles inserted into it;—superiorly, and

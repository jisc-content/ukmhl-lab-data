NERVES OF THE NECK. 487 liate at the left side in the thoracic duct, and at the right in the lymphatic trunk of that side. Lymphatics have not been discovered in the substance of the brain. They have however been seen ramifying in the dura mater along the course of the vessels. The deep lymphatics of the face follow the course of the internal maxillary vessels, and enter the superior cervical glands, and thence descend along the chain of these bodies placed in the course of the great cervical vessels, connecting one with the other. Hence they are termed glandules concatenates. Their termination is similar to that of the superficial lymphatics. Section V* NERVES OF THE NECK. 547. The nerves proper to the neck are derived from the cervical plexus. We shall omit, for the present, the several cerebral nerves which pass through it to their dif- ferent destinations, though they give off what may be termed cervical branches in their course. The cervical â– plexus consists of an interlacement, formed by the anterior branches of the four first spinal nerves placed at the upper and lateral part of the neck ; it extends from the transverse process of the second to that of the fourth vertebra, resting on the fibres of the posterior scalenus and levator scapulae muscles, and concealed by the sterno-mastoid. Each nerve, as it passes through the inter-vertebral foramen, divides into a posterior and an anterior branch, the latter going to the plexus, the former destined for the muscles at the back part of the neck. 548. The posterior branch of the fourth is smaller than either of those above it, except the first. It passes directly backwards between the transverse processes, and having given several filaments to the complexus muscle, pierces the splenius, and trapezius, supplying both, and ultimately ter- minates in the integuments. The posterior branch of the

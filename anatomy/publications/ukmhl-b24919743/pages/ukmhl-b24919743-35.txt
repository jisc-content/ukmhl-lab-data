The one they have seen cheerful and contented, making a gradual and steady progress to improvement, whilst the others but too often sink irrecoverably, vic- tims to constitutional irritation, — to moral depression. They who have had opportunities of making such a com- parison need not be told, that on the speedy and judi- cious performance of an operation depends alike the credit of the surgeon and the safety of the patient: and what motives more powerful can be adduced—what incentives more cogent can be urged to impel a man of reflecting mind to apply sedulously to that pursuit on which so much depends ? 9. Whilst conducting the examination of an organ, or when giving what may be termed its anatomical history, the anatomist (says Beclard*) should consider his subject as divisible into the following heads, and should treat each of them seriatim et singulatim. 1st. Its form and outline— its disposition, as being symmetrical or irregular; 2nd, its situation in reference to contiguous parts, as well as regards the entire body ; 3rd, the direction of its great diameter, which may be parallel, oblique, or perpendicular, to the axis of the body; 4th, its size; 5th, its physical properties, viz., its degree of density, cohesion, elasticity, colour, &c.; 6th, its anatomical composition and texture, or the arrange- ment of its integral parts; 7th, its chemical composition and properties; 8th, the fluids or humours which it con- tains, or secretes ; 9th, the properties it manifests during life ; 10th, its vital action, and the connexion of that action with others ; 11th, the varieties dependant on age and sex, or individual peculiarities ; 12th, the morbid changes. Some of these topics may appear to belong to the de- partments of chemistry, physiology, or pathology, rather than to anatomy; still “ none of them should be omitted, * Anatomie Generate, p. 132.

67 THE ISCHIUM. supported in the sitting position. On the superior extre- mity of the bone, (if it be examined in early life, or after a section has been made of the os innominatum, so as to divide it into its three parts) three surfaces may be observed, of which two are flat and triangular, and mark its junction with the ileum and os pubis; the other, con- cave and smooth, forms part of the acetabulum. The inferior extremity is identified with the tuberosity, pre- sents two rather rough borders, and an intervening space and is marked by three muscular impressions. The ra- mus of the ischium is the flat, thin part, which ascends forwards and inwards from the tuberosity, towards the ramus of the pubis with which it is united. One margin of the ramus forms part of the inferior outlet of the pelvis, the other of the thyroid foramen. Attachments of Muscles. To the ramus is attached part of the gracilis; to its external surface, and to the border of the tu- berosity, the adductor magnus ; to the inner margin of the tuberosity, the erector penis; to the adjacent margin of the ramus, the transversus perinei; the internal and external ob- turator muscles to the corresponding surfaces of the bone round the thyroid or obturator foramen. To the posterior surface of the tuberosity, the three flexors of the leg, scil. the biceps, semi-tendinosus, and semi-mem- branosus; to the rough line, leading from the acetabulum to the tuberosity, the quadratus femoris; to the external surface of the spine, the gemellus superior; to the adjacent border of the tuberosity, the gemellus inferior; to the inter- nal surface of the bone, the levator ani; and to the spinous process, the cocc.ygeus. At the junction of the three pieces of the os innominatum is situated the acetabulum, or cotyloid cavity, which arti- culates with the head of the femur; of this the ischium forms somewhat more than two-fifths, the ileum somewhat less than two-fifths, and the remainder is made up by the F 2

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 92 semicircular ridge, which is lodged in the space intervening between the radius and ulna; a wide and deep groove which receives the prominent part of the larger sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and lastly, a prominent ridge, which is received into the internal part of the same cavity. This pro- minence descends much lower than the external portion of the articular surface, and determines an obliquity in the di- rection of the humerus, when its lower extremity is made to rest on a plane surface. The groove with its margins, forms a well marked pulley-like surface, on which the sig- moid cavity of the ulna moves in flexion and extension, hence it is termed the trochlea. At the fore-part of the in- ferior extremity of the bone, and immediately above the trochlea, is a superficial depression which receives the co- rono'id process of the ulna during flexion, and posteriorly a more considerable fossa, which lodges the olecranon duiâ€™ing the extension of the fore-arm. A modification of the nomenclature applied to these dif- ferent eminences has been proposed by Chaussier ; retain- ing the term trochlea for the surface of articulation with the ulna, he calls that which articulates with the radius, the condyle, and for the two lateral eminences of insertion, now named condyles, he substitutes the terms epi-trochlea and epi-condyle. Attachments of Muscles. The posterior surface to the triceps ; the anterior (by the posterior margin of the bicipital groove,) to the teres major and latissimus dorsi; in the middle, by a slightly marked line to the coraco-brachialis; inferiorly, to the brachialis anticus ; the external portion of the same sur- face, superiorly, by a rough eminence to the deltoid, by the anterior margin of the bicipital groove, to the pectoralis major. The greater tuberosity gives attachment by the three flat surfaces on its upper border, to the supra-spinatus, infra-spi- natus, and teres minor muscles ; the lesser tuberosity to the subscapularis. The inferior extremity, by its external condyle, to the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, extensor

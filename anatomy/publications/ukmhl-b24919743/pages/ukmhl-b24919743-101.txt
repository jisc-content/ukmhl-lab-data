77 THE FIBULA. furcates towards its lower extremity, so as to enclose a slightly concave triangular surface, which is subcutaneous ; the internal one also gives attachment to muscles, and in- feriorly, where it inclines forwards, to the interosseous liga- ment. The internal surface looks backwards for about a third of its extent, and somewhat forwards in the rest, and is divided, but unequally, into two parts, by a slightly mark- ed longitudinal line, to which the interosseous ligament is attached for about two-thirds of its length; the part of the surface behind this is grooved. The external surface is also grooved, and gives origin to muscles; the posterior, convex and smooth, serves the same purpose, presents towards its middle a small foramen, directed obliquely downwards for the transmission of the medullary vessels; in the lower part it inclines inwards, and is terminated by a rough surface connected with the tibia. The superior, or tibial extremity, is smaller than the other; it presents on the supero-internal part, a small oval, and nearly flat surface, for its junction with a correspond- ing part of the external tuberosity of the tibia; the re- mainder is unequal, and gives insertion to the biceps flexor cruris, to the external lateral ligament of the knee joint, and to those which connect the tibia and fibula. The inferior, or tarsal extremity, forms the external malleo- lus, which is longer and more prominent than the internal: in front it receives the insertion of ligaments, behind is si- tuated a shallow groove, traversed by the tendons of the peronei muscles; the outer side is convex and subcuta- neous ; the inner presents a small triangular surface, con- vex in the perpendicular, and nearly plane in the antero-pos- terior direction, which articulates with the astragalus, and is bounded posteriorly by a rough depression, affording attachment to the transverse ligament of the ankle joint, whilst the apex gives origin to the external lateral ligament. The fibula articulates at both extremities with the tibia, and at the inferior one with the outer border of the astragalus.

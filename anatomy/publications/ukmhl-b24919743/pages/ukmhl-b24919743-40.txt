ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 16 different efforts required to be performed, being the mus- cles, which, as their name implies, are the moving powers of the body. Each of these exerts a peculiar action, which in most instances is perceptible on the slightest inspection; but if any doubt arises, it can at once be removed by a con- sideration of the direction of its fibres, and of the bearing of the points between which they are stretched. Muscles, however, seldom act singly; two or more usually combine in the performance of each effort, by which some advan- tages are gained, at the same time that the symmetry of the different parts of the body is preserved. These considera- tions have suggested to anatomists the idea of dividing the muscles into groups, the division being established by a re- ference to the manner in which they are associated in their combined actions. Winslow, when reviewing the actions of the muscles of the upper extremity, arranges them under the following heads :â€” 1. The actions of the muscles which move the bones of the shoulder on the trunk. 2. The actions of the muscles which move the os humeri on the scapula. 3. The actions of those which move the bones of the fore-arm on the humerus. 4. The actions of the muscles which move the radius on the ulna. 5. The actions of the muscles which move the carpus on the fore-arm. 6. The actions of those which move the fingers. Bichat fully coincides with Winslow as to the propriety of studying the combined actions of muscles, but he has adopted a different division and arrangement, which the au- thor has deemed it advisable to follow, as being more simple and easy of comprehension. To the practice of surgery, an accurate knowledge of the actions of muscles is indispensably

214 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the rest of its extent: relations—by its posterior surface with the sciatic nerve, the gluteus maximus, and semi-mem- branosus muscles; by the anterior, with the obturator exter- nus, the lesser trochanter, and part of the insertion of the psoas magnus muscle; its upper border is in relation with the inferior gemellus, the lower with the adductor magnus. 233. The obturator externus, (sous-pubio trochanterien externe, Chauss.; extra-pelvio-piibi-trochanterien, Dumas) is situated on the anterior and external aspect of the pelvis, and superior part of the thigh. Form—flat and triangular. It arises from the external flat surface of the os pubis, from the rami of the pubis and ischium, as far as the margin of the obturator foramen, and from about half the surface of the obturator membrane. From this extensive origin the fibres pass outwards, converging to a tendon, which is di- rected behind the neck of the femur, to be inserted into the lower part of the trochanteric fossa, beneath the inferior gemellus: direction—obliquely outwards, winding round the posterior part of the neck of the femur: structure— tendinous at its insertion, fleshy in the greater part of its extent, with a slight mixture of aponeurotic fibres at its origin: relations—its anterior surface, which in the erect position of the body, is also the inferior one, is covered by the adductor brevis, and pectineus muscles, also by the ob- turator vessels; the posterior one corresponds with the os pubis, its ramus, and that of the ischium, as well as the ob- turator membrane ; one surface of its tendon is closely con- nected with the fibrous capsule of the hip joint, the other is covered by the quadratus femoris. Combined Actions.—The transverse direction of these muscles and their mode of insertion into the trochanter, together with the great mechanical advantage afforded them by the length of the cervix femoris, enables them to act powerfully in rotating the thigh, and therefore the whole limb outwards. In position, direc- tion, and action, they are analogous to the muscles which pass from the dorsum of the scapula, to the great tuberosity of the humerus;

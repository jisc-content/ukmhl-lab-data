93 THE RADIUS. communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus and supinator radii brevis; by the internal condyle to a tendon common to the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, pal- maris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and flexor digitorum sub- limis. The Radius. Cl. The radius, shorter than the ulna by the length of the olecranon, is placed at the external side of the fore-arm, extending from the humerus to the carpus. It is broader below than above, slightly arched in its form, and divided into a body and two extremities. As the body is somewhat triangular, we observe on it three surfaces, bounded by three margins, or angles. The anterior surface expands towards the lower part, is marked at the centre by a longi- tudinal depression for the flexor pollicis longus ; superiorly is situated the foramen for the medullary vessels, its direc- tion being from below upwards; and inferiorly a flat sur- face, corresponding with the pronator quadratus. The pos- terior surface, convex in the greater part of its extent, is grooved at its central third, for the origin of the extensors of the thumb; the external surface, round and convex, is marked towards its middle by a rough impression that gives insertion to the pronator radii teres. Of the margins separating these surfaces, the posterior is distinct only at the middle part; the external is round, and becomes smooth towards the lower extremity, whilst the internal is acute and sharp for the attachment of the interosseous liga- ment. The body is terminated superiorly by a rough pro- minence, termed the bicipital tuberosity, from its giving in- sertion to the biceps muscle. Above the tuberosity the bone becomes narrowed and constricted into the form of a neck, which is again sur- mounted by the head, intended by its extremity to articu- late with the round convex part of the lower extremity of the humerusâ€”tuberosity (condyle, Chauss.) whilst its margin

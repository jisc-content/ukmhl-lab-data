THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 45 other earthy substances under the same circumstances. The analysis of bone affords the following results. According to Fourcroy and Vauquelin. Animal matter . 51 Phosphate of lime 37*7 Carbonate of lime 10 Phosphate of magnesia . . . . 1.3 100 According to Berzelius. Cartilage 32*17 Blood-vessels 1*13 Fluate of lime 2 Phosphate of lime 51*09 Carbonate of lime 11*30 Phosphate of magnesia 1*16 Soda, muriate of soda, and water . . 1*20 100 The general results of these analyses serve to shew that the fibrillae into which bone may be divided by maceration, consist of a cellular tissue, containing in its areolae a quan- tity of earthy salts. Respecting its ultimate fibre, several fanciful notions have been entertained by different persons. Thus it was considered by one to consist of absorbent vessels, filled with phosphate of lime. Others thought it to be made up of lamellae and fibres, between which was interposed an osseous juice, &c. Such gratuitous assumptions serve no other end than to lead inquiry out of the true path, and to retard, instead of promoting, the progress of useful knowledge. 31. Of all the systems of organs, the osseous is that which arrives latest at its full period of development, the progress

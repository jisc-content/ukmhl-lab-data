MUSCLES OF THE LITTLE FINGER. 395 along the inner border of the palm of the hand. It is su- perficial to the palmar fascia, as well as to the muscles of the little finger. 411. b. The abductor digiti minimi runs along the ulnar border of the palm of the hand, arising by tendinous fibres from the pisiform bone and annular ligament, where they are blended with the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The fleshy belly, of which the muscle consists, ends in a tendon, which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger, at its ulnar border. The muscle rests on the fifth metacarpal bone, and on the opponens or adductor of the little finger, and is covered by the palmaris brevis and palmar fascia. 412. c. The flexor brevis digiti minimi is placed on the same plane with the abductor, lying close to its palmar border. It arises from the anterior surface of the annular ligament, and from the unciform bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. In some instances the flexor does not exist, in which cases the abductor is found larger than usual. From this circum- stance, as well as from its position and direction, it may be inferred, that, in addition to its ordinary action of abduction, the last named muscle can become also a flexor. 413. d. The adductor vel opponens digiti minimi, is somewhat triangular in its form, and placed under cover of the others. It arises from the annular ligament, and from the unciform bone, from which the fibres incline forwards and inwards, to be inserted into the whole length of the fifth metacarpal bone. The muscles placed in the space intervening between the two borders of the hand, are the lumbricales and inter- ossei. 414. The lumbricales are four tapering, fleshy fasciculi, extended from the tendons of the flexor profundus, to the first digital phalanges, and are therefore but accessories or appendages to that muscle. They arise by fleshy fibres

TEMPORAL MUSCLE. 463 and tendinous fibres from the lower border of the zigoma (extending as far back as its tubercle,) and is inserted into the upper half of the ramus of the jaw. The external surface of this part of the muscle is concealed, in the greater part of its extent, by the malar, or anterior portion, with which it is inseparably united ; part, however, projects be- hind it, and is covered by the parotid gland. Its inner surface is in contact with the tendinous insertion of the temporal muscle into the coronoid process, and with the external pterygoid, where it lies across the sigmoid notch, between that process and the condyle. 511. The temporal muscle is of considerable size, being broad, and expanded above, where it is attached to the side of the skull, and narrowed to a point below at its insertion. It arises from the whole of the temporal fossa, (p. 131) its fibres being implanted into all that depressed surface, included between the oblique ridge, on the parietal bone, and the crest that bounds the great ala of the sphe- noid, and extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone, to the root of the mastoid process. The fibres, from this extensive origin, converge to a short, strong tendon, the posterior set proceeding almost horizon- tally forwards, those in the middle being nearly vertical, and the anterior set inclining a little backwards. The ten- don passes beneath the zigoma, and is inserted into the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla, which its fibres surround. The muscle is covered, and bound down by a remarkably dense, firm membrane, (temporal fascia) which is attached inferiorly to the margin of the malar bone and the zigoma, where it is separated from the muscle by some loose adipose and cellular tissue; but higher up, the fascia expands, and becomes closely connected with the muscular fibres, and finally ceases at the curved ridge bounding the temporal fossa, where its fibres are blended with those of the muscle.

12 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. as all are necessary to guide the researches of the anato- mist.”* A correct and intimate knowledge of the structure and composition of each organ is indispensably necessary to the understanding of its functions ; an acquaintance with the structure and functions leads, by an easy and na- tural transition, to the investigation of the lesions of struc- ture and function induced by disease,—the only data on which we can establish a correct diagnosis and a rational plan of treatment. These views are briefly stated by Bec- lard in his work on General Anatomy; they were fully de- veloped in his oral lectures ; and, if we refer to Professor Meckel’s treatise on Anatomy, we shall find every part of the subject treated on nearly the same plan, and with equally comprehensive views. A single instance will suffice to show his mode of division and arrangement. Art. 3. The accessory organs of the abdominal portion of the alimentary canal. 1. The liver. A.

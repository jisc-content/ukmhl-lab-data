ELEMENTS OP ANATOMY. 662 necessary to saw through the broad part of the occipital bone down to the foramen magnum, and then to cut through the arches of the vertebrae at each side along the whole of the column, with a knife, or chisel and mallet, as it is both tedious and troublesome to saw them. The arches being removed, the dura mater may be laid open in its entire length, and the description of the contained parts referred to. SECTION III. 695. The sympathetic nerves (nervi intercostales ; nerfs cle la vie organique, Bichat) form a system by them- selves, characterized by many peculiarities which dis- tinguish them from those nervous cords which are con- nected with the brain and medulla spinalis. They extend from the cranium to the pelvis, lying along the vertebral column, and present a chain of ganglia connected by ner- vous filaments, each ganglion being considered, by most physiologists, as a special centre of nervous influence. In the infancy of anatomy the term “ ganglion” was used to denote a swelling in the thecae of tendons, and even at the present day it is not unfrequently employed in the same sense. It was subsequently applied to the knotted ap- pearance presented by certain nerves ; but of late years a considerable latitude has been given to its signification by Gall and Spurzheim, who include within its comprehension the several masses of cineritious substance inclosed within the medulla and brain, and which, according to their theory, are considered “ ganglia of increase” to the forma- tive fibres of the cerebral hemispheres. Nervous ganglia may be divided into two orders : 1. Those observable on the posterior roots of the cerebro-spinal nerves, including that of the fifth nerve, as well as the slight swelling on the nervus vagus ; 2. the ganglia of the sympathetic nerves. 696. To facilitate the description of the sympathetic nerves it becomes necessary to consider them as divisible

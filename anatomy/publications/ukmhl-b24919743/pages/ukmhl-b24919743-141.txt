117 THE MALAR BONE. face is rough, and the body of the bone is hollowed into a large cavity, antrum Highmorianum, or maxillare. Articulations. With the corresponding bone; with the frontal, by its nasal process; also with the ethmoid and ossa nasi; with the palate bone, by its tuberosity; with the malar, by the malar protuberance; with the os unguis, the vomer, the inferior spongy bone, and nasal cartilage. Attachments of Muscles. Proceeding from below upwards ; to the border of the alveolar arch, the buccinator; to the ca- nine fossa, the levator anguli oris, and the compressor nasi; to the margin of the orbit part of the levator labii; to the nasal process, the orbicularis palpebrarum, and the common elevator of the lip and ala of the nose; and just within the orbit, the inferior oblique muscle of the eye. The Malar Bone. 81. The malar bone, common to the face and orbit, forms the most prominent point of the side of the former, and the greater part of the outer border of the latter. Its form is quadrangular. The facial or anterior surface, pierced by some foramina for small vessels, is convex, and gives at- tachment to the zigomaticus muscle. The posterior bounds the zigomatic fossa, and is rough for its articulation with the maxillary bone. The superior surface, lunated, pro- jects into the orbit, and articulates with the frontal, sphe- noid and superior maxillary bones. The superior border forms the outer margin of the orbit; the inferior is on a line with the zigomatic arch, which it contributes to form; the anterior articulates with the maxillary bone; the pos- terior, curved, gives attachment to the temporal aponeu- rosis. It articulates with the frontal, maxillary, temporal, and sphenoid bones. Attachments of Muscles. To the zigomatici, by its anterior sur- face ; to the masseter, by its inferior border ; by its anterior angle, to part of the levator labii superioris.

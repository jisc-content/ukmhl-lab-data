MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND FACE. 455 cricoid and thyroid cartilages. It has been supposed that the fibres of the thyro-arytsenoi'd muscles are not merely stretched from before backwards, between the cartilages, but that some of them are attached at different points to the chordae vocales, and so may act as stops on a musical string, limiting the ex- tent of the part which vibrates at a given moment, and thereby modifying the sound. The thyroid Gland. 494. On the sides of the trachea and larynx is situated a soft, spongy, and exceedingly vascular mass, called the thy- roid gland, though it does not possess an excretory duct, or elaborate any appreciable secretion. It consists of two la- teral lobes, whose longest diameter extends from above downwards, each being rounded and broad below, narrow and pointed above, and connected by a narrow transverse slip, placed usually in front of the second and third rings of the trachea, in some cases passing between that tube and the oesophagus. The lobes extend down to about the sixth ring, and upwards as far as the ala of the thyroid cartilage. It receives four arteries of considerable size, and is sur- rounded by a thin investment of condensed cellular mem- brane, which gives its surface a smooth and shining appear- ance. It is covered by the skin, cervical fascia, the sterno- hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and in some instances projects laterally, so as in some degree to overlap the ca- rotid arteries. Section II. The muscles of the head consist of those of the skull and those of the face. The former include the occipito- frontalis, and external muscles of the ear ; the latter, those of the eye-lids, nose, lips, and lower jaw. 495. The occipito-frontalis is a flat,, thin, digastric mus- cle, extended from the occiput to the forehead (whence its name), and placed immediately beneath the cranial integu- ment, to which it closely adheres. It consists of two short

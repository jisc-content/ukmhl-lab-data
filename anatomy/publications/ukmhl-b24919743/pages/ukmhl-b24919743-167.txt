148 CHAPTER III. THE ARTICULATIONS. 91. The different pieces of the osseous system being con- nected together so as to form the skeleton, their modes of union must be as various as their forms and uses. The connecting media are ligament, cartilage, fibro-cartilage, and fibrous membrane, variously arranged and disposed, per- mitting, in some instances, no perceptible motion; in others, allowing a free and extended range in every direction; still all the varieties, however numerous, are usually included under the general termâ€”articulation. 92. The articulations are divided into three classes; viz. the immoveable, the moveable, and mixed ; the last being inter- mediate in degree between the others. The first form ob- tains where flat and broad bones are united to enclose ca- vities for the lodgement of important organs, as in the cra- nium and pelvis. In some instances the surfaces are in- dented and reciprocally impacted one into the other, so that complete solidity is insured by the structure of the part; and as this mode of union occurs only amongst flat bones, their deficiency in extent of contact is compensated by the indentations in their margins. There is another set of im- moveable articulations, in which the surfaces are merely in apposition with one another, yet total immobility is secured by what may be termed a mechanical contrivance. Thus, though the squamous part of the temporal bone merely rests against the inferior border of the parietal, no motion can exist between them, in consequence of the manner in which the petrous portion of the former bone projects into the base of the skull. 93. All the bones of the head and face,,except the lower

83 THE PHALANGES. cuboid posteriorly, on the inner side with the third meta- tarsal and third cuneiform bones, on the outer with the fifth metatarsal. The posterior extremity of the fifth me- tatarsal bone, pyramidal in its form, articulates posteriorly with the cuboid, and on the inner side with the fourth me- tatarsal bone; on its external and lower side is a rough tuberosity, which gives attachment to the peroneus brevis and to part of the abductor minimi digiti. The anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones are con- vex, and rounded into the form of a head, flattened at the sides, and elongated from above downwards. The head is bounded by a groove, or neck, better marked on the upper than on the under surface. These extremities are received into shallow depressions in the first phalanges with which they are articulated. / The Phalanges of the Toes. 58. The toes which form the last part of the foot are composed each of three phalanges, except the first, which has but two. The body of the first presents three surfaces, one inferior, or plantar, is flat; the others, lateral, are smooth and convex, and meet on the dorsum in a rounded border; they are contracted towards the middle, somewhat rough and broad at the extremities for the attachment of liga- ments ; concave towards tire sole of the foot, and convex superiorly. The posterior extremities, broader than the anterior, are concave, and receive the heads of the meta- tarsal bones. The anterior terminate in two rounded heads, with an intervening pulley-like surface, the lateral parts being received into depressions, in the contiguous extremi- ties of the second phalanges, whilst the middle groove lodges a prominent line marked on the latter. The bones of the second phalanx, much smaller than the first, are somewhat hollowed on the lower surface, and con- vex on the upper one; their borders are flat and com- pressed. The posterior extremities are terminated by two g 2

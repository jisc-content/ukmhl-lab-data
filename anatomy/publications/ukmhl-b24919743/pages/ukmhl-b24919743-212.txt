188 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. The deep-seated calcaneo-cubo'id ligament lies close to the bones, being separated from the former by some cellular tissue; its breadth is considerable, its length scarcely an inch, one extremity being attached to the calcaneum before the long ligament, the other (somewhat expanded) to the under sur- face of the cuboid bone. A synovial membrane lines the surfaces of the two bones, and the ligaments which connect them. 192. The second range of the tarsal bones, viz. the scaphoid, cuboid, and three cuneiform, are connected to- gether in the following manner, so as to form separate articulations between each pair of them. The scaphoid and cuboid bones when in contact, which is not always the case, present two articulating surfaces covered with carti- lage, and lined by a synovial membrane. They are con- nected by, 1, a dorsal ligament, composed of short, thin fibres extended obliquely between the two bones ; and, 2, a plantar, situated in the sole of the foot, and composed by transverse fibres. 193. The articulation of the cuboid with the external cuneiform bone is effected by a dorsal ligament, which is a thin fasciculus of fibres, extended between them, and a plantar ligament, whose fibres are transverse. 194. The articulation of the scaphoid with the cuneiform bones. The scaphoid bone articulates with the three cu- neiform, by the smooth faces on its anterior surface, the connexion between them being maintained by dorsal and plantar ligaments. The dorsal ligaments, three in num- ber, pass from the superior surface of the scaphoid to the first, second, and third cuneiform bones into which they are inserted. The plantar ligaments are similarly disposed on the under surface of the bones, but not so strongly marked. 195. The three cuneiform bones are connected by two dorsal and two plantar ligaments extended transversely from

80 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. face rather rough, inclined outwards and upwards, gives attachment to ligaments. The inferior surface presents, in front, a depression traversed by the tendon of the Pero- neus longus muscle, in the middle a transverse ridge (tube- rosity), and behind it an irregular surface, both of which give attachment to the calcaneo-cuboxd ligament; the for- mer also to some fibres of the ligamentum longum Plan- ts. In front is a smooth surface, divided into two parts, the internal one being square, the external triangular and articulated, the former with the fourth, the latter with the fifth metatarsal bone; behind, a surface by which it is unit- ed with the os calcis; externally is observed a groove, con- tinuous with that on the inferior surface, and serving for the transmission of the tendon of the Peroneus longus mus- cle. On the internal surface may be observed, towards its middle, an elongated, smooth, and nearly flat portion, which articulates with the third cuneiform bone, the part before and behind it being rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The cuboid articulates with the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones before, with the os calcis behind, and with the exter- nal cuneiform, and sometimes with the naviculare. Os Naviculare. 55. Not unfrequently called the scaphoid bone. It pre- sents round its circumference inequalities for the attachmert of ligaments ; behind, a concavity for the anterior surface of the astragalus; in front, three separate surfaces for arti- culation with the three cuneiform bones; on the inner side a prominence receiving the attachment of the tibialis posticus muscle ; on the outer side in some instances a small articular surface, by which it is united to the os cuboideum. It ar- ticulates with the three cuneiform bones, with the astraga- lus, and sometimes with the cuboid. The Cuneiform Bones. 56. These constitute the most anterior part of the tar-

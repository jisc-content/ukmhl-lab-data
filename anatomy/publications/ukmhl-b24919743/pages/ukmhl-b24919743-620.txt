576 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. ternal serous: it is situated above the central aponeurosis of the diaphragm, behind the sternum and cartilages of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs of the left side, before the bronchi, oesophagus, and descending aorta, and between the reflected layers of the pleurae which separate it from the lungs. Though the two membranes of which the peri- cardium is composed are intimately united, still their ge- neral distribution, as well as their structure and properties, are so different, that it is impossible to describe them together: we must, then, notice each separately. 627. The fibrous membrane, dense, thick, and un- yielding, consists of fibres which interlace in every direc- tion. Most of them are attached to the central aponeu- rosis of the diaphragm, and superiorly, where they embrace the large vessels, they form tubular prolongations, which after passing for some way upon them, become blended with their external coats. The internal or serous lamella re- presents a shut sack partially inverted on itself, and so disposed as that the internal or inverted part embraces the heart, whilst the other lines the inner surface of the fibrous lamella. It was the great simplicity of arrangement ob- servable in the serous pericardium, as contrasted with that of other membranes of the same class, that suggested to Bichat the idea of comparing it to a double night-cap ; for if the heart could be drawn out of it without injury to its continuity, it would resemble an elongated sack closed on all sides, and we should then have demonstrative proof, that though that organ is invested by the membrane, it is still without its proper cavity. The Heart. 628. The heart—the central organ of the circulation—is a hollow muscle, irregularly pyramidal in its shape, which lies between the lungs, enclosed in its proper investment— the pericardium. It is placed so obliquely, that if a line corresponding with its axis were passed through it, at the

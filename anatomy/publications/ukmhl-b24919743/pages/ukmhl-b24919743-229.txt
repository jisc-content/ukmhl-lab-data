205 ADDUCTOR MAGNUS. within, outwards and downwards, radiating as from a common centre: structure—fleshy in the greater part of its extent, aponeurotic where it arises from the ischium, and is inserted into the condyle : relations—the superior, or shortest border, is parallel, and on the same plane with the quadratus femoris; the internal, or longest border, is cover- ed by the fascia lata, gracilis, and sartorius; the external border (its femoral attachment), is interposed between the two other adductors and the vastus internus, which lie in front of it, and the gluteus maximus, and short head of the biceps, which separate it from the vastus externus. The posterior surface is covered by the sciatic nerve and ham-string muscles, the anterior by the sartorius, the ad- ductor brevis and longus, and the crural vessels. The anterior surface of the muscle is intimately blended with the adductor longus before they reach their insertion, it also sends off an aponeurosis, which passes in front of the femo- ral vessels, and becomes blended with the vastus internus; finally its prolonged portion is intimately connected with the last named muscle. The interval left between the two parts of this muscle for the passage of the femoral vessels, is triangular in its form, and fleshy and tendinous in its structure, when viewed from behind, but at its anterior as- pect it is altogether tendinous in its entire extent, and oval in its form, its margins being formed of the following parts; viz., the prolonged tendon of the adductor magnus inter- nally, the vastus internus externally, the superior border corresponding with the conjunction of the adductor longus and magnus; the inferior with the point of union between the prolonged tendon of the last named muscle and the vastus internus. Combined Actions.—These are the direct adductors of the femur, and their force must be considerable, both from their strength and number. As the linea aspera projects from the shaft of the bone, the adductors are removed proportionally from its axis, and so are enabled to rotate it outwards, thus conspiring with a dis-

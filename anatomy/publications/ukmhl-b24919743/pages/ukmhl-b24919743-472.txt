432 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. condyles of the humerus, to the head of the radius. Care should be taken when dividing the skin, to avoid the large cutaneous veins beneath it. The fascia should be divided over the border of the supinator longus; and when the belly of the muscle is drawn outwards, the situation of the artery and its accompanying nerve becomes apparent: but, before any attempt is made to pass the needle round it, the thin and deep-seated lamella of fascia must be divided. The needle may then be passed from without inwards, so as to avoid the nerve. The flexor carpi ulnaris serves as a guide to the ulnar artery, in the lower half of its course, being the only part in which it can be tied. The length of the incisions and steps of the operation are similar to those indicated for the radial artery, The brachial artery may be exposed and tied in any par t of its course, the border of the biceps, and coraco-brachialis serving as a guide to its situation. When the arm is drawn away from the side, and slightly everted, the hand being supinated, the seat of the operation is fairly brought into view. The first incision through the skin should be about three inches in length, along the border of the biceps muscle. This will expose the fascia, which is to be divided to the same extent. Now, if the operation be performed low down, the median nerve will be found to the inner side of the artery, if in the middle, it lies in front of the vessel, or crosses immediately behind it; whilst in the upper part of the arm, the nerve lies to the outer side of the artery. These facts should be recollected when the endeavour is being made to sepa- rate the nerve from the artery, preparatory to passing the ligature round the latter. When the arm is a little bent, the biceps muscle and the nerves become relaxed, and may readily be drawn aside, so as to facilitate the separation of the artery from the veins which accompany it, previously to passing the ligature round it.

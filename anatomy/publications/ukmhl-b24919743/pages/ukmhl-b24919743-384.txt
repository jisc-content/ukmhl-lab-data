346 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. deferens must be wounded, should it be carried beyond a very few lines. In the female the round ligament only would be endangered, which is of comparatively little con- sequence. To avoid these consequences, Sharpe recom- mended the edge of the bistoury to be inclined upwards and outwards, by which means its direction would be paral- lel with that of the cord; but then the epigastric artery lies exactly before it. Though this fact would seem rather decisive against adopting the practice, Dupuytren prefers it to any other, and no vessel appears to have been wounded in any of his operations ; doubtless, from the fact that it is only necessary to divide a few fibres of the ligament. One point then remains, in which the stricture may be divided without risk, viz. by inclining the edge of the bistoury, after it has been introduced, obliquely upwards and inwards. On this but one contingency rests, and that an extremely remote one, namely, when the obturator artery rises from the epigastric in such a way that, as it descends into the pelvis, it runs along the anterior and inner side of the ring. For full information on this important subject the reader will consult the following works :—Sir Astley Cooper’s Treatise on the Anatomy and Surgical Treatment of Her- nia: Lawrence on Ruptures: Sir A. Cooper’s Lectures on Surgery, edited by F' Tyrrell : and Scarpa on Hernia.

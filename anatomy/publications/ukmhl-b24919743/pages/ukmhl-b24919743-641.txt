VASCULAR SYSTEM—CIRCULATION IN THE FOETUS. 597 into the head and upper extremities, a small part only being con- veyed downwards into the descending part of the aorta. Now, the blood which is brought back from the superior parts of the body and the head, by the jugular and subclavian veins, to the right auricle, passes, during the earlier periods, without any in- termixture with the blood of tire inferior cava, into the right auricle, and thence into the corresponding ventricle, which, by means of the pulmonary artery, propels it partly into the lungs, but chiefly through the ductus arteriosus, into the descending aorta, and so into the inferior parts of the body. This descending current consists of a less pure fluid than that circulated by the superior aortic branches, as most of it had already circulated through the superior parts of the system of the foetus, the rest being merely that portion which is conveyed downwards from the arch of the aorta, after having sent the chief part of its blood up- wards into the subclavian and corotid arteries. The iliac vessels, into which the aorta divides interiorly, convey the blood into the lower extremities ; but the greater part of it is sent, by the umbi- lical arteries, to be circulated in the placenta. And as, in after life, the capillaries of the lungs and those of the general system are op- posed to one another, so, during foetal life, a similar antagonism is maintained between the capillary system of the embryo and that of the placenta. The blood at this early period describes two circles, which intersect one another, and communicate at the heart, so as to describe (to use Bichat’s expression) the figure 8. At first, as has been stated, the blood of the superior and that of the inferior cava do not intermingle in the right auricle : but as the valve of the foramen ovale increases, and narrows the pas- sage into the left auricle, some part of the blood of the inferior cava being prevented from flowing in that course, mixes with that of the descending vein, and with it is conveyed into the right ven- tricle, so that a gradual approximation is thus being made towards that condition and arrangement of the circulating system which obtain in after life. The peculiarities which mark each of the organic systems of the foetus, as well as that now under consider- ation, lessen as it approaches the period in which it is destined to pass from a dependent, and, as it were, parasitic existence, to a separate and independent one.

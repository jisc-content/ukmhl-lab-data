641 CEREBRAL NERVES—FIRST PAIR. 676. The ligamentum dentatum forms a connexion be- tween the medulla spinalis and the contiguous surface of its fibrous investment. It is attached to the latter by a series of pointed processes, which give it a serrated or dentated appearance. The first process is fixed to the margin of the foramen magnum, between the vertebral ar- tery and the hypoglossal nerve, and each succeeding one is implanted between the points at which the nerves make their exit. The bases of the processes form a continu- ous line along the side of the medulla, to which they are connected through the medium of the pia mater which in- vests it, and each of them resembles a delicate septum, interposed between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves. It appears to be fibro-cellular in its structure, and quite distinct from the other membranes, particularly from the arachnoid, which invests it. SECTION II. THE CEREBRAL NERVES. 677. The fir at pair of nerves (olfactory ; par primum) lies in a longitudinal groove marked on the under surface of the anterior lobe of the brain, about half an inch exterior to the median fissure; when undisturbed it appears flat, but is evidently triangular in form, the upper angle being lodged in the groove just alluded to. The nerve is soft in its texture, not being invested by a membranous tube or neurilema, but the arachnoid membrane is stretched across its inferior surface, and so retains it “ in situ.” The nerve arises by three roots, two of which are medullary, the third or intermediate one being cineritious. The ex- ternal root is the longest, and may be traced in the form of a white line obliquely outwards along the border of the fissure of Sylvius, where it corresponds with the last con- volution of the anterior lobe of the brain: it appears to be 2 T

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. o(> CHAPTER II. Section I. THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 22. The osseous system is peculiarly fitted, by its soli- dity and hardness, not only to give support to the soft parts, and determine their form, but also to furnish points of attachment to the muscles, by which the different move- ments are executed. This solid frame-work of the body is made up of a number of separate pieces, the aggregate of which has been termed “ the skeleton.” The vertebral co- lumn may be considered as the central or fundamental part of the whole, both because it exists in all animals which possess a skeleton, and also because the different parts of the osseous system are either immediately or mediately connected with it as a common centre. Thus, on its supe- rior extremity or apex, it supports the skull; laterally it gives attachment to the ribs which arch forwards, to form, with the sternum, a bony case for the lodgement of the organs of respiration and circulation, at the same time that they furnish externally a point of support for the bones of the superior extremity: inferiorly the column is immove- ably connected with the pelvic bones, which are articulated with those of the lower extremity. The osseous structure is situated deeply, being covered by the soft parts and common integuments; at least, this is the case in all the vertebrated animals, but whether the hard osseous investment of insects and crustaceous animals be strictly analogous to the internal bony skeleton of the higher classes is a point as yet undetermined by naturalists. The enumeration given in the annexed tabular view, will be found to agree with that adopted by the best autho- rities.

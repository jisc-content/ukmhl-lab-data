ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 112 triangular and elongated, is placed between the lesser and greater wings, opens into the orbit, and transmits the third, fourth, ophthalmic branch of the fifth and the sixth pairs of nerves; and also the ophthalmic vein. This fissure is separated at its base from the foramen opticum by a thin plate of bone connecting the lesser wing with the body of the sphenoid bone; to this is attached a small tendon, common to the inferior, internal, and external recti mus- cles of the eye. Of the foramina, one anterior, internal, round (foramen rotundum) transmits the superior maxil- lary branch of the fifth pair of nerves; the other more ex- ternal, larger, oval (foramen ovale) gives passage to the inferior maxillary branch; and the third, (foramen spino- sum) the smallest, to the middle meningeal artery. The root, or base, of each pterygoid process is pierced by a circular foramen (pterygoideum) extending horizontally from before backwards, slightly expanded before, narrowed behind, and giving passage to the posterior branch from Meckel’s ganglion (vidian, pterygoid). The body of the sphenoid bone articulates posteriorly with the basilar process of the occipital, anteriorly with the ethmoid; with the orbitar processes of the frontal by the lesser and greater alae; with the anterior inferior angles of the parietal, and the squamous portion of the temporal, by the great alae, and by the spinous process with the angle between the pe- trous and squamous portions of that bone: with the vomer it articulates by the rostrum ; with the malar bone by means of the external border of the orbitar plate, and with the pa- late bones by the pterygoid processes. Attachments of Muscles.—Round the optic foramen on each side are attached th^ four recti, the obliquus superior, and levator palpebrae muscles: to the external surface of the great ala, the temporal muscle: to the external pterygoid process the external pterygoid muscle : to the pterygoid fossa the internal pterygoid: to the inferior half of the internal pterygoid plate, the superior constrictor of the pharynx ; and to the fossa na- vicularis, the levator palati.

This last has been called by Mr. Hunter guber- naculum testis; it appears a little broader above than below, and also to contain a minute canal. In the seventh month of pregnancy the length of the gubernaculum is consider- ably diminished, as the testis has changed its place, having removed from the lumbar region to the iliac fossa. This in strictness cannot be considered a descent: for in the ordinary position of the foetus, the change is the reverse of that in which its gravity would draw it, and therefore it is rather an ascent. In the eighth month, the testis enters the internal ring, lying behind a process of peritonaeum, which makes its exit from the abdomen by the inguinal canal; cind at the ninth month it will be found at the bot- tom of the scrotum, bearing the same relation to its peri- tonaeal investment that it had originally done to the whole membrane, that is to say,â€”lying behind and exterior to its cavity, but still partially covered by it. This process of peritonaeum is an elongated cul-de-sac, somewhat like the finger of a glove, communicating at the inguinal ring with the general cavity of that membrane, and resting on the forepart of the testis and its cord, but closely adherent to both. By degrees its aperture is closed by the narrowing of the ring, and all communication with the abdomen is cut off, after which the part of the process which corresponds with the cord degenerates into cellular tissue, whilst that over the testis remains still a serous cavity. The position and relation of this organ to its serous investment may be illustrated by taking a small bladder, and pressing some elongated body, such as an almond, against its side, so as partially to invert it, the inverted portion being made to serve as an immediate, though partial covering for the sub- stance so placed, as a part must remain unconcealed along

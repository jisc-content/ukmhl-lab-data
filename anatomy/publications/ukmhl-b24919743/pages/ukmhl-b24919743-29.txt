5 INTRODUCTION. animal lives, the impressions of external objects must be conveyed to the sacculus, through the hones of the head generally. The first change in the structure of the part is intended for the improvement of the acoustic or sentient apparatus, and consists in the addition, as it were, to the sacculus, of three semicircular canals, which consist of a fibrous, cartilaginous, or osseous envelope (corresponding in this particular with the structure of the fundamental part, from which they are prolonged like so many diverticula), a vascular lining, an expanded nerve, and a fluid. In some cartilaginous fishes the organ consists merely of the fun- damental part (the sacculus or vestibule). In the skate and shark the semicircular canals are added. In the am- phibia the development improves somewhat. In the class of reptiles the two first parts of the labyrinth attain their complete form, and a rudiment of the third is added, viz., the cochlea, which consists of the same structures as the others, and like them serves to contain a prolongation of the auditory nerve. The vestibule and semicircular canals in birds, present nearly the same conformation as in the higher reptiles; the cochlea is still rudimentary; but the tympanum is large, and traversed by the ossicula; the membrana tympani may be observed at the bottom of the auditory canal, round which the external teguments are sometimes folded, so as to represent a rudiment of a concha. In the mammalia, the auditory apparatus attains its com- plete development, and as it comprises all those parts found in various degrees of perfection in the lower orders, it may be considered as divisible into four distinct compartments, each intended for a separate office.* 1. The essential or fundamental part (vestibule). 2. The accessory apparatus (semicircular canals and co- chlea). 3. The middle chamber and its ossicula, for the trans- mission of sounds (tympanum). * De’ Blainville, Principes d’Anatomie comparSe, p. 450.

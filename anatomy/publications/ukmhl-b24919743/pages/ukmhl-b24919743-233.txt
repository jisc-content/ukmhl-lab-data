209 GLUTEUS MEDIUS. its whole length; 3, from the posterior sciatic ligament. From these origins, the coarse thick fibres of which the muscle consists, converge as they pass downwards and out- wards, and terminate in a broad strong tendon, whose ex- ternal surface is rough and irregular, but the internal is smooth, and lined by a bursa mucosa, where it corresponds with the great trochanter. This tendon is inserted between the vastus externus and adductor magnus, into that rough longitudinal impression which descends from the great tro- chanter to the linea aspera. Direction—downwards, for- wards, and outwards: structure—the fleshy fibres, which immediately succeed to the aponeurosis of attachment su- periorly, are arranged in parallel lines and aggregated into large distinct bundles, separated by cellular membrane. These fleshy bundles successively terminate at the poste- rior border of a strong, common tendon, which extends from opposite the upper part of the great trochanter, where it is broad, and confounded with the fascia lata, to the line of attachment just described: relations—when the muscle is separated from its superior connexions and re- flected downwards, it will be found that its inner surface covers, and is therefore in relation with the ileum, sacrum, and coccyx, the great sciatic ligament, gluteus medius, the gluteal, sciatic, and pudic arteries, the external rotator mus- cles, the great sciatic nerve, the trochanter major, the tube- rosity of the ischium, and the superior extremities of the semi-tendinosus, and biceps muscles; its external surface is covered by the fascia lata ; the upper and anterior border is firmly connected by that membrane with the gluteus me- dius; the posterior is on the same plane, and somewhat identified with the common origin of the sacro-lumbalis, and longissimus dorsi muscles, the inferior border (the longest) forms the fold of the nates. 227. The gluteus medius, (grand ilio-trockanterien, Chauss.; ilio-troclianterien, Dumas) is situated on the ex- ternal surface of the pelvis, partly covered by the preceding p

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 360 colli; in the interval they lie between the longissimus dorsi and the spinous processes of the vertebrae. 361. The inter spindles, as their name implies, are short fasciculi of fleshy fibres, placed between the spinous pro- cesses of the contiguous pairs of vertebrae. They are well marked, and defined in the neck; in the lumbar region they are seldom distinct, and in the dorsal can scarcely be said to exist. As each passes from the upper border of a parti- cular spinous process in the neck, to be inserted into that next above it, it must consist of two parts, one for each tu- bercle, inasmuch as the spinous processes in this region (except the first and last) are bifid at their extremities. Their points of attachment at once indicate their extent and relations. 362. In close contact with the inter-spinales, and placed along their posterior border, may be observed, in most in- stances, some thin bundles of fibres, which cannot be said to lie within the interval of the spinous processes. On the contrary they extend from the summit of one, to the next, or second next, above it. From this circumstance they have been called supra-spinales, and as they increase gra- dually from below upwards, being situated in the median line, they may be considered as analogous to the recti capi- tis postici. 363. The inter-transversales are placed between the trans- verse processes of the cervical vertebrae: they can seldom, if ever, be demonstrated in the dorsal or lumbar region. As the transverse processes of the vertebrae in the neck are bifid, the muscles disposed between each pair of them are arranged in two planes, one before the other, so that the cervical nerves at their exit from the vertebral column necessarily pass out between them. 364. The multijidus spince extends along the spinal co- lumn from the sacrum to the axis, filling up the deepest part of the groove between the transverse and spinous pro-

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 348 ridge, extending forwards from it; 2, in the cervical re- gion, from the fibres of the corresponding muscle, both being blended together, and from a tendinous band, called ligamentvm nucha:; 3, from the spinal process of the last cervical, and all those of the dorsal vertebrae, as well as from the inter-spinous ligaments. From these different points of origin the fibres proceed towards the top of the shoulder, following very different directions; those from the occiput inclining downwards and outwards, and those from the lower part of the back upwards and outwards, the obliquity of each set diminishing, so that those intermediate between the two extremes become horizontal. The supe- rior fibres turn forwards a little, and are inserted into the external third of the clavicle, the middle pass transversely to the upper border of the acromion process, whilst the in- ferior ones ascend to that of the spine, being attached as far back as the triangular surface at which it commences. The tendinous fibres by which the muscle arises are rather short along the interval from the last dorsal vertebra as high as the fourth; there they lengthen gradually, but opposite the fourth cervical vertebra they again acquire about the same extent, so that in the interval between these points, the union of the muscular with the tendinous fibres forms a crescent, and if the two muscles be dissected together they will represent an oval. From the line of union of the two trapezii along the neck, a band of condensed cellular membrane, mixed with ten- dinous fibres, extends deeply, so as to reach the spinous processes of the vertebras, forming a septum between the sets of muscles on each side of the middle line. It is at- tached by one extremity to the occipital protuberance, by the other to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra; its posterior border being blended with the fibres of the trapezii, whilst the anterior is fixed to the spinous processes. This is usually called ligamentum nuchce. In the human subject it can only be considered as a rudiment of

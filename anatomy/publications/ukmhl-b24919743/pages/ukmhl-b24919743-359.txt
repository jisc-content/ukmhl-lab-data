323 HERNIA—EXTERNAL RING. find it closely connected by cellular bands with the line of junction between the iliac portion of the fascia lata and Poupart’s ligament, and further down it becomes connected with the borders of the saphenous opening, being stretched across from one to the other, so as to form that cribriform lamella through which the superficial vessels pass, and which, for the reasons already stated, when describing the fascia lata, cannot be considered as a part of that mem- brane. 332. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle being exposed by the removal of the superficial fascia, the fibres which compose it will be observed gradually to separate as they approach the crista of the pubis, and to be aggregated into two bundles, leaving an interval between them, as they pass, the one to the pubic symphysis, the other to the tu- berosity of the pubis. This interval must therefore be of a triangular form, its base corresponding with the crista of the pubis, and the sides with the two bundles of fibres above referred to. This has been called the external ab- dominal ring,—a term evidently ill-chosen, if its form be considered, more particularly as its bounding lines are named pillars. Towards the crest of the pubis a rounded cord (spermatic) projects through the opening, but its borders or pillars are not distinctly defined, which is owing to the circumstance of a membrane being stretched across from one to the other, and also prolonged on the cord. If the surface of the aponeurosis of the external oblique be examined, a series of fibres will be observed running upon it and describing arches, the convexity of which looks downwards and inwards. As they approach the triangular aperture they become more closely aggregated together, and lose their fibrous character, so as to assume that of a smooth membrane, which passes thence downwards on the cord, forming one of its investments. Whilst resting on the fibres of the muscle, this structure is called the inter- columnar fascia, and where it comes into contact with the y 2

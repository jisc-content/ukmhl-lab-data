ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 610 Gall,) correspond with the posterior and lateral parts of the medulla: they diverge as they ascend towards the lobes of the cerebellum. The posterior aspect of the medulla oblongata is slightly concave, and divided into two lateral parts by the median sulcus, to which two oblique lines converge, giving it an indented appearance. This has been termed calamus scriptorius. One or two elongated cords are also observable on this surface, which have not as yet received names, “ but whose offices may one day be discovered*.” 654. The medulla spinalis gives origin to thirty-one pairs of nerves, which are regular, symmetrical, and dou- ble-rooted. One of the roots of each nerve arises from the anterior, the other from the posterior aspect of the medulla. The fibres which form the latter pass outwards, converging towards one another, and in the tubular invest- ment of dura mater, which incloses them, form a ganglion. The fibres of the anterior root pass to the same point, and having united, join with the preceding, immediately ex- ternal to the ganglion. The trunk thus formed is a compound nerve in structure and in function, for the re- searches of Mr. Bell have indisputably shewn that sensi- bility resides in the posterior root, and motility in the anterior. There are eight cervical pairs of nerves, the upper four of which form the cervical plexus (sect. 547); the lower four, with the first dorsal, constitute the brachial plexus (sect. 433): the dorsal nerves are twelve in num- ber ; eleven of them correspond with the intercostal spaces. There are five lumbar nerves (sect. 299), and six sacral (sect. 308), which form two plexus, from which is- sue the nerves of the lower extremity. These have been described with the regions in which they are situated. * C. Bell, Exposition of the Nervous System, p. 21.

226 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. tibio-plialangeitien commun, Chauss.; Dumas) is situated at the posterior part of the leg close to the bones, and be- neath those of the foot. Formâ€”elongated, flat and thin su- periorly, divided into four tendinous portions towards its insertion. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line which gives attachment to the popli- teus and soleus, and continues its attachment to within three inches of the inner ankle, some fibres also arise from an aponeurosis, which connects it with the tibialis posticus, and flexor longus pollicis. The fleshy fibres pass obliquely into a tendon situated at the posterior aspect of the muscle. The tendon passes behind the internal malleolus along a groove common to it and the tibialis posticus (the latter be- ing next to the bone); from thence it is directed through a groove in the calcaneum, obliquely forwards and outwards into the sole of the foot, where it is crossed by the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, with which it is connected by a transverse tendinous slip. The tendon then divides into four processes, corresponding with the four lesser toes, and as they run along their under surface, they are bound down to the phalanges by fibrous sheaths; op- posite the second phalanx, each tendon passes through a fissure in the tendon of the flexor brevis (whence the terms, perforans is applied to the one, perforatus to the other), and, finally, they are inserted into the bones of the third phalanges. Previously to its division, the ten- don of the flexor longus gives insertion to an accessory muscular structure (flexor accessorius), which connects it with the calcaneum, and materially modifies the direction of its action on the toes. Close to the point of division the tendons give origin to four small muscles (lumbricales) which pass forwards to be inserted into the first phalanges of the four lesser toes ; these may also be considered as ac- cessories to the flexor longus. Though in the dried bone only one impression is marked for the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus, the fibrous sheath which retains

304 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Section V. THE MEMBRANES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY, AND OF THE ABDOMINAL PARIETES. 319. In the preceding section we have detailed the dif- ferent methods to be adopted, and the successive steps to be pursued in commencing and proceeding with the dissec- tion of the lower extremity. When by these means the common integument has been dissected off and removed, the limb will still be found invested by another membrane of quite a different structure, being of a glistening white colour, close in its texture, and composed of fibres crossing in various directions. Anatomists have classed it amongst the fibrous membranes, and named it the fascia lata of the thigh. The leg is enclosed in a similar investment, and so is the foot. But each presents certain peculiarities, which require a separate consideration. 320. The fascia lata of the thigh may be considered as its special or immediate investment, not only enclosing it in its entire extent from the knee to the pelvis and Poupartâ€™s ligament, but also sending processes inwards in several si- tuations, which form septa between the muscles. The thickness of this membrane varies in different parts. It is considerable along the external side of the thigh, it is less so on its internal and posterior aspect; but anteriorly, it is in some places so thin as to require great care in dissecting off the skin, else the fascia will be removed with it. When examined towards the lower part of the thigh, it is found to be prolonged over the knee-joint, and to be continuous with a similar membranous investment of the leg. It has at the same time a connexion more or less intimate with all the bony prominences round the articulation, viz. with the two condyles on each side, with the tuberosities of the tibia below, with the head of the fibula to the outer side, to which it is guided by the biceps muscle, and finally, after

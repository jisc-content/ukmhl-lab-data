ELEMENTS of anatomy. 98 it articulates with the square part of the articular surface of the radius; inferiorly, concave, with the os magnum and unciforme; on the ulnar side with the os cuneiforme; on the radial side with the os scaphoides; anteriorly and pos- teriorly it gives attachment to ligaments. Os Cuneiforme. 66. Its form is pyramidal; superiorly, it is in relation with the inter-articular fibro-cartilage of the wrist joint; in- feriorly, it articulates with the os unciforme ; on the ulnar side, gives attachment to ligaments; on the radial side, ar- ticulates with the os semi-lunare; anteriorly it affords at- tachment to muscles, and presents a small articular surface for the os pisiforme. Os Pisiforme. 67. Is placed on a plane, anterior to the other bones of the carpus. Its form is indicated by its name. It presents but one articular surface, which is situated on the posterior part, or base, and is in relation with the anterior surface of the os cuneiforme ; it affords attachment, anteriorly, to the annular ligament of the carpus. Os Trapezium. 68. Superiorly concave, it articulates with the os sca- phoides ; inferiorly, concave from behind forward, and con- vex transversely, with the first metacarpal bone; on the ul- nar side, with the os trapezo'ides, and, by a small surface situated more inferiorly, with the second metacarpal bone; on the radial and posterior sides it gives attachment to liga- ments; anteriorly it presents a groove, traversed by the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and an eminence to which the annular ligament of the carpus is attached. Os Trapezoides. 69. It articulates superiorly with the os scaphoides; in-

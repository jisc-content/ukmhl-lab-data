PREFACE. X a correct and thorough knowledge of the osseous and muscular systems, as reference is constantly made to them during the description of every other part of the body. If this be neglected in the first instance, the deficiency will seldom be supplied at a subsequent period, and at every step of the student’s progress he will feel the want of certain portions of knowledge, which reminds him that an important link in the chain of demonstra- tion is lost. As well might a person hope to acquire clear notions of the demonstrations in Euclid’s Elements without a knowledge of the definitions and axioms to which reference is made in every problem, whether it be simple or complex, as hope to prosecute anatomy with success with- out an accurate knowledge of those parts which form the basis of all the others, and to which allusion is made in every subsequent step of his progress.

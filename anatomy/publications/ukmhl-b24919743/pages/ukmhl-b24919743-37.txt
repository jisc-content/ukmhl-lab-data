INTRODUCTION. 13 Few could venture upon such an undertaking as that of collecting and arranging all the established facts and princi- ples that are connected with anatomy (special as well as ge- neral) physiology and pathology; none but a Meckel could have executed it in a style worthy of the present state of medical science. This great anatomist did not rest satis- fied with consulting (whilst composing his treatise) all the standard works, ancient as well as modern, which treat ex- pressly of anatomy and its collateral branches—he has aLo examined almost all the detached papers and essays which lie scattered through the pages of the various periodical publications, and journals of scientific societies, not only of his own country, but of every country in Europe ; and on perusing his work it will be found to contain the most va- luable part of the materials derived from these different sources, blended with some that may be considered original. Such a production as this is valuable to the present gene- ration from the quantity of information it contains, and at any future period may be appealed to as the best criterion of the state of opinion, at the time in which it was written, concerning the most important subjects of anatomical re- search. But this is not all—Meckel may be considered to have laid down, by this publication, the plan and scope of the courses of instruction which should be given by teachers of anatomy, if they intend them to be at all commensurate with the present state of anatomical science. The main object of a course of lectures is to make those who attend them fully acquainted with all the established facts, as well as admitted principles of the subject of which they treat: so that they may be considered “ as placed on a level with the present state of science.” If this be accomplished, it is not difficult, with a moderate degree of assiduity, both to retain what has been already acquired, and keep pace with the pro- gress of such improvements as may, from time to time, be introduced. 10. Systematic treatises have been very generally found

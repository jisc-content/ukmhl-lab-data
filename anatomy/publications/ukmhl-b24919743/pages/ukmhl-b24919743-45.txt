ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. 15. The human body, considered as the subject of anato- mical investigation, may be vievved as a whole, made up of several parts, each ministering to distinct purposes, and all more or less necessary to the life and well being of the in- dividual. As effects cannot follow without causes, or ac- tions be performed without instruments, so, in a fabric at once so complex and delicate as that of man, many agents or organs must be employed to execute the va- rious functions which are required for the support of the individual, and the continuance of the species; these the anatomist studies, either singly or arranged in groups, ac- cording to their functions; or he l-esolves them into their elements, to ascertain their composition and structure. Even on a superficial inspection, an obvious division of the body at once presents itself, viz. into head, trunk, and ex- tremities. The trunk, composed of two compartments, or cavities, encloses several of the more important organs ; the inferior and larger cavity, the abdomen, contains the organs of digestion, those engaged in the secretion and excretion of urine, and part of the generative system ; -whilst in the tho- rax, or superior one, are placed those of respiration and circulation. The head gives lodgement to the organs of sense, at the same time that its cavity, by means of its com- munication with the vertebral canal, encloses the central organs of innervation, viz. the brain and the medulla spina-

261 ANTERIOR TIBIAL AND DORSAL ARTERIES. muscles incline inwards, the one to the tarsus, the other to the first metatarsal bone, whilst the artery continues di- rectly onwards, it necessarily passes beneath the extensor pollicis, and is placed between the tendon of this muscle and that of the extensor communis digitorum. In this situ- ation it is covered only by the skin and fascia of the leg. The anterior tihial artery is accompanied by two veins (ivencc comites); the anterior tibial nerve lies to its fibular side for some way, as being derived from the peroneal nerve, but usually inclines in front of it as it descends. Its branches are as follows: a. Small muscular branches to the tibialis posticus, as it passes between its beads : b, on reaching the front of the leg, it sends up- wards a pretty large and regular branch, (arteria recurrens) which passes through the fibres of the tibialis anticus, and soon divides into several ramifications, which on the lateral and fore parts of the knee joint, anastomose with the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal: c, in its progress downwards between the extensor muscles it gives on each side several muscular branches : d, near the ankle joint the two malleolar arteries are given off; the inter- nal one passing beneath the tendon of the tibialis anticus, reaches the inner ankle, and ramifies upon it, supplying the surrounding textures, and communicating with branches of the posterior tibial; the external malleolar artery bears a similar relation to the outer ankle ; having passed under the tendon of the common extensor, it anastomoses with the posterior peroneal artery, and also with some ascending or reflected branches from the tarsal artery. 280. The dorsal artery of the foot (la pedieuse, Bichat) is the continuation of the anterior tibial, extending from its termination, at the bend of the ankle, to the posterior extre- mity of the first metatarsal space, where it dips into the sole of the foot, and terminates by inosculating with the plantar arch. Its direction is forwards and inwards, running over the astragalus, the scaphoid, and internal cuneiform bones ; it is covered by the skin and fascia, and lies between the tendons of the extensor proprius pollicis and extensor com-

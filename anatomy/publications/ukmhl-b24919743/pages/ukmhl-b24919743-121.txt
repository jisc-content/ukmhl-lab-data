97 THE CARPUS. the summit of the olecranon to the triceps brachialis; the coronoi'd process, by a rough surface to the brachialis anticus ; by its internal side, to the second origin of the pronator teres. The Hand. The hand is composed of the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. The Carpus. 63. The first, or superior part of the hand, is so named; it is placed between the fore-arm and the metacarpus, and composed of eight small bones, which are disposed in two ranges, each consisting of an equal number. Proceeding in the enumeration from the radial to the ulnar side, the bones which constitute the first, or superior range, are the scaphoides, semi-lunare, cuneiforme, and pisiforme; those of the second, or inferior range, are the trapezium, trape- zoides, os magnum, and unciforme. The dorsal surface of the carpus is convex, the palmar concave and irregular, and marked by four bony prominences, across which is stretched the annular ligament, so as to form a canal for the trans- mission of the flexor tendons. Os Scaphoides. 64. Its form is convex on one side, concave on the other. It articulates superiorly with the inferior articular surface of the radius; inferiorly, with the trapezium and trape- zoides; on its ulnar side by two small surfaces, the superior with the os semi-lunare, the inferior with the os magnum ; on its radial side, is attached the external lateral ligament of the wrist joint; posteriorly is a groove for the attach- ment of ligaments. Os Semi-lunare. 65. Irregularly triangular in its form, convex superiorly, H

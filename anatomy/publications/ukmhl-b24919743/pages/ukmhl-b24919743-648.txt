G04 CHAPTER IX. SECTION I. NERVOUS SYSTEM. 643. The nervous system in the vertebrated animals may be considered as divisible into two parts: one, consisting’ of cords, or fibrillte, universally diffused through the body, and called nerves—the other, the central mass in which these nerves terminate. To this, as to a common centre, the nerves convey the impressions which are made by external agencies on their sentient or peripheral extremi- ties, and from it they reconvey the mandates of the will. 631. When viewed as a whole, the nervous system is symmetrical in the strictest sense. It consists of two lateral halves, which, being disposed similarly on each side of the central line, resemble one another in every parti- cular. Thus, the brain is divided into two hemispheres, each presenting on its inferior surface three lobes. The cerebellum also is divided into two lobes, and the medulla oblongata into two lateral halves, each consisting of three fasciculi or bundles of fibres—the division being established by two grooves or sulci, one on its anterior, the the other on its posterior aspect, situated exactly in the median line. These sulci, by being continued along the whole length of the medulla spinalis, divide it also into two symmetrical portions. 632. This symmetrical arrangement extends to the nerves also, so long as they retain the form of distinct cords ; but when, at their perepheral termination, they become expanded into, and blended with the minute tex- ture of the different organs which they supply, their mode of distribution altogether eludes our research. We can,

169 THE METACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. gaments passing transversely from one bone to the other. There are, however, but two interosseous Jibro-cartilages placed one at each side of the os magnum, connecting it with the trapezoid externally, and the unciform internally. Such are the means of connexion peculiar to each row > those common to both are an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral ligaments. 148. The lateral ligaments are placed one on the radial, the other on the ulnar border of the carpus ; the former con- necting the scaphoid bone with the trapezium, the latte‚Äù the cuneiform with the unciforme. 149. The anterior ligament consists of short fibres, passing obliquely from the bones of the first, to those of the second range. The posterior is similar in structure and arrange- ment. It may be observed, that the first range of carpal bones forms a concavity, the second, particularly the magnum and unciform, a convexity received within it; by which means a ball and socket joint is formed, which is completed by a synovial membrane reflected over the articular sur- faces of the different osseous pieces which compose it. It moreover sends two processes between the three bones of the first row, and three between those of the second, so as to facilitate their respective motions. The Carpo-metacarpal Articulations. 150. The four last metacarpal bones are connected with those of the carpus, by means of two sets of fibrous bands, situated, one on the palmar, the other on the dorsal surface, the latter being better marked. All but the fifth metacar- pal bone receive two bands. Thus to the second, or that of the fore-finger, a thin fasciculus of fibres passes from the trapezium, another from the trapezoid bone ; the third re- ceives one from the latter and also from the os magnum, the fourth from the os magnum and also from the unci- forme ; but the fifth is connected to the latter only.

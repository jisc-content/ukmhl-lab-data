59 THE COSTAL CARTILAGES. increases gradually from the first to the eleventh, inclusive. In the last it is not perceptible, in the first it is not distin- guishable from the tuberosity. The two first and the two last ribs present some peculia- rities deserving of notice. The first rib is shorter and broader than either of the succeeding ones; its direction is nearly horizontal, its body not being twisted as the others are. The superior or ex- ternal surface is marked by a smooth depression, over which slide the subclavian vessels ; the inferior is slightly hollow- ed posteriorly, and looks towards the cavity of the thorax. The external border, convex and rounded, is surmounted by the tuberosity; the internal is thin, and forms the mar- gin of the superior aperture of the thorax. The anterior extremity is broad and thick; the posterior is thin and nar- rowed into the form of a neck; its head presents an un- divided articular surface. The second rib is longer than the first, and presents ex- ternally a prominent line for the attachment of the serratus magnus; its internal surface is somewhat grooved poste- riorly. The eleventh has no groove on its inferior border, nor a tubercle, as it is not articulated with the transverse pro- cess ; its angle is scarcely perceptible, and the head has but one articulating surface. The twelfth differs little from the preceding one, except in being shorter; it has neither angle, tubercle, nor groove, and as its anterior extremity, which is pointed, seems loose and unattached, it is called the floating rib. The Costal Cartilages. 39. These cartilages are twelve in number ; their breadth diminishes gradually from the first to the last, whilst the length increases as far as to the seventh, after which it be- comes less in each succeeding one. Their line of direction also varies considerably. The second one is horizontal,

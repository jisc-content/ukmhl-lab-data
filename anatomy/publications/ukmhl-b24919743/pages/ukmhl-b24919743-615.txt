571 PLEUR/E. 625. The Pleura are two thin, semi-transparent mem- branes placed in the thorax, and so disposed as to form each a shut sack, thus conforming to the general law of serous membranes. Each membrane will be thus found to line the inner surface of the thoracic parietes, and to be reflected over the corresponding lung, giving it a smooth investment, the point of reflection corresponding with the root of the organ. Inferiorly, the membrane covers the convex surface of the diaphragm, and superiorly, forms a small cul-de-sac at the bottom of the neck, over the sum- mit of the lung. The part of the membrane which invests the lung is called pleura pulmonalis, that which lines the thorax, pleura costalis. These two membranous sacks, by their apposition along the middle line, form a septum (mediastinum), which divides the thorax into its two lateral chambers ; it extends from the top of the thorax to the diaphragm, and from the spine to the sternum, with some inclination to the left side (inferiorly), owing to the posi- tion of the pericardium and heart. The interval between the two membranes in this situation gives lodgement, im- mediately behind the sternum, to the thymus gland, and some cellular tissue ; and lower down, to the pericardium and heart. Along the spine, we find similarly situated, with regard to the membranes, the oesophagus, the vagus nerves, the descending aorta, thoracic duct, and splanchnic nerves, with some lymphatic glands and cellular tissue. Now the bronchi and root of the lungs, by their transverse position, separate the mediastinal interstice into two parts, of which one is termed, ordinarily, the anterior, and the other the posterior mediastinum.

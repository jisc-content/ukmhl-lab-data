543 PERITONEUM. strip of the membrane, about three inches in breadth, vve trace it upwards behind the recti muscles to the diaphragm, being gradu- ally checked and folded on the umbilical ligament, which retains the point of reflexion on a line with the lower surface of the liver, whilst the reflected layers are in apposition with one another, and continued up between the diaphragm and liver, gradually narrow- ing to a point at the upper border of the latter. The falx thus formed is continuous by its borders with those parts of the mem- brane that line the contiguous surfaces of the diaphragm and liver, whilst its base passes down on the lower surface of the latter to its transverse fissure, where it is arrested by the vessels, and reflected down upon them, forming the upper layer of the lesser omentum. So far for the narrow strip which is disposed along the middle line; we may continue to follow it down to the stomach, and over its surface to the great curvature, from which it is prolonged loose and unattached, forming the upper, and after- wards the under layer of the great omentum, as already indicated, when tracing it from below upwards. We may follow it, in the next place, to the transverse colon, and thence down to the spine, where it becomes united with the part (A) at the root of the me- sentery. We shall, however, suspend this proceeding, until we have traced the two lateral parts to the same point, viz. the front of the hepatic vessels. Commencing, then, a little to the left of the umbilicus, we follow the membrane behind the costal cartilages, and along the under surface of the diaphragm to the deepest part of the left hypo- chondriac region, where it meets the oesophagus, on which it is reflected down to the great curvature of the stomach, where it is arrested by the vasa brevia, and by them guided to the spleen, and reflected over its surface, from which it returns towards the stomach again, where it becomes continuous with the left border of the great omentum. In the interval between the oesophagus and falx, the membrane passes over the surface of the diaphragm down to its lower border, over which it descends to the transverse fissure, and so to the lesser omentum. Now, at the right side, the membrane, after lining the diaphragm, passes upon the upper surface and right border of the liver, and having passed over its lower margin, we trace it upon the concave surface of that organ, where it invests the gall-bladder, and so reaches the right margin

499 THE NECK—OPERATIONS. in the same way as in the preceding operations, and then dividing the skin for three inches and a half over the upper border of the clavicle. The platisma and fascia may be successively divided on a director in the same direction and extent, after which a blunt probe should be employed, to tear through the cellular membrane that fills up the triangular interval in which the vessel is lodged. The external jugular vein will be found close along the margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and should be carefully avoided. The subclavian vein will be observed, after the division of the fascia, behind the clavicle, alternately swelling and sub- siding. This arises both from the natural flow of the current within it, as well as from the reflux caused by the action of the auricle. The hurried and agitated state of the respiratory action also exerts a considerable influence, both on the quantity of blood in the subclavian vein, as well as on that which flows from the cut extremities of the smaller veins, which are of necessity divided. If this becomes embarrassing, the operation may be suspended for a moment, and the patient slightly elevated, so as to allow him to make a full and easy inspiration, after which the regurgitation from the mouths of the vessels will cease, and the tension of the large vein will be diminished. When the omo-hyoideus is brought into view, the thin fascia which bends down its tendon may be torn through, and then the artery can be felt pulsating where it rests against the first rib. When attempting to pass the ligature its point should be directed from before backwards, and then made to turn from below upwards behind the artery, care being taken to keep it close to the vessel, so as to avoid the pleura on which it lies, and the nerves which are placed close above it.— The reader is referred to Burn’s Anatomy of the Head and Neck, and Harrison on the Surgical Anatomy of Arteries. 2 k 2

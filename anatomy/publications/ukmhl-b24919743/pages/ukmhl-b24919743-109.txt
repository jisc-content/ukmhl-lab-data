THE SCAPULA. 85 Ossa Sesamoidea. These do not properly form part of the skeleton; they may be considered as accessories to the tendons of muscles, and are found only in the limbs, never in the trunk. In the superior extremity two are always found in the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with its first phalanx, and sometimes in the corresponding joint of the fore-finger. In the lower extremity, two are situated behind the femoral condyles, also behind the first joint of the great toe, and sometimes of the others; as well as in the tendons of the tibialis posticus and peroneus longus. They are situated in the direction of flexion, (the only exception being the patella, which belongs to this class of bones) and serve the purpose of increasing the power of muscles, by altering their line of direction, and removing them farther from the axis of the bone on which they are intended to act. The Bones of the Superior Extremity. The upper extremity consists of the shoulder, the arm, the fore-arm, and hand. The shoulder consists of the sca- pula and clavicle, the arm of the humerus, the fore-arm of the radius and ulna, and the hand of the carpus, metacar- pus, and fingers. The Scapula. 59. This bone is placed upon the upper and back part of the thorax, occupies the space from the second to the seventh rib, and forms the posterior part of the shoulder. Its form is irregularly triangular and flat. It presents for examination two surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The anterior surface, called also fossa subscapularis, looks towards the ribs, is triangular, slightly concave, intersected by prominent lines, directed from within outwards and up- wards, and therefore crossing the direction of the ribs. The posterior surface (dorsum scapulce) is divided into

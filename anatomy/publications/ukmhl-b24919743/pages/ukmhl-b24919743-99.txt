75 THE TIBIA. which give attachment to the crucial ligaments and to the semi-lunar cartilages. The lower, or tarsal extremity, is much smaller than the other, and nearly quadrilateral in its form; the anterior surface, convex and smooth, gives at- tachment to the anterior or tibio-tarsal ligament; the poste- rior is flat, and marked by a groove for the flexor longus pollicis ; the external slightly concave, is rough superiorly, for the attachment of the transverse ligament, and smooth below, to receive the extremity of the fibula. From this end of the bone projects downwards a triangular apophysis, the internal malleolus ; its inner surface is convex, and merely covered by the skin, the external is smooth, and articulates with the side of the astragalus; the anterior forms a round- ed border, whilst the posterior is marked by two grooves for the tendons of the tibialis posticus, and flexor commu- nis ; to the most dependent part of the process is attached the internal lateral ligament. The lower articular surface consists of two parts, one vertical, just described as being situated at the outer side of the malleolus; the other hori- zontal in its direction, concave and quadrilateral in its form, divided into two parts by a slightly raised line ; of these two -surfaces, which are tipped with cartilage in the fresh state, and united at a right angle, the latter rests on the dorsum of the astragalus, the former applied to its inner flat border. The body of the tibia, triangular in its form, diminishes gradually in size for about two thirds of its length, after which it increases somewhat towards its lower extremity. The internal surface is convex and subcutaneous in the greater part of its extent, but its upper part is covered by the tendons of the sartorius, semi-tendinosus and gracilis muscles. The external surface, slightly hollowed above, where it gives origin to the tibialis anticus, is convex, and somewhat inclined forwards belo\r, where it is covered by the extensor tendons. The posterior surface, not so uniform in its outline as the others, is marked at its upper third by a line extending upwards and outwards to the external tu-

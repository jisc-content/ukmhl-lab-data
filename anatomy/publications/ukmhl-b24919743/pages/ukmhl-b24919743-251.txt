FLEXOR LONGUS POLLICIS PEDIS. 227 them in their situation is divided into two parts by a septum, or partition, so that each runs in a separate groove lined by a distinct synovial membrane. Direction—vertical in the leg, horizontal in the foot: structure—fleshy and tendinous: relations—in the leg it is bound down by the deep fascia, and covered by the posterior tibial vessels, which separate it from the soleus; its anterior surface rests against the tibia, and overlaps the tibialis posticus muscle; in the foot its tendon lies between those of the flexor longus pollicis, and peroneus longus, (which are above it, and nearer to the tarsal bones) and the flexor brevis digitorum which lies beneath it. 250. The flexor longus pollicis pedis (peroneo-sous-pha- langettien du pouce, Chauss.) is situated close to the fibula, along the external side of the leg, and at the under and in- ner part of the foot. It arises from the posterior surface of the fibula, (its inferior two thirds) slightly from the inter- osseous ligament, and from the intermuscular septa inter- posed between it and the peronei externally, and the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus internally. The fleshy fibres, continuing to arise nearly as far as the external ankle, pass obliquely into a tendon placed on their posterior sur- face ; the tendon traverses a groove on the tibia, external to that which transmits the tibialis posticus and flexor digito- rum, then passes through another in the astragalus, and so reaches the sole of the foot, where, after being connected to the common flexor by a tendinous slip, it turns for- wards beneath the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, and, after running through a fibrous sheath which binds it to the first phalanx of the great toe, is inserted into the base of the second. Structure—fleshy in the greater part of its extent, tendinous inferiorly: relations—in the leg it is bound down by the deep fascia which separates it from the soleus; its anterior surface rests on the fibula, and overlaps q 2

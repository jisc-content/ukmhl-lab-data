120 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the ethmoidal cells, and the external bounds the zigoma- tic fossa. The posterior terminal process presents three faces; the superior, concave, looks towards the body of the sphenoid ; the external is grooved, and by being applied to the pterygoid process, forms the pterygo-palatine canal; the internal one corresponds with the nasal fossae. At the point of divergence of these two processes may be observ- ed a small excavation, with a smooth border, which, when the bone is in situ, forms with the sphenoid, the spheno- palatine-foramen ; it is sometimes completed by a small la- mella of the palate bone itself. Articulations:â€”with the corresponding palate-bone; with the maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, vomer, and inferior spongy bone. Muscular Attachments. By its spine, to the azygos uvulae ; by the central groove on its tuberosity, to a small part of the internal pterygoid ; and, by the transverse ridge on the palate plate, to the aponeurosis of the circumfiexus palati. The Vomer. 85. The vomer, so called from its resemblance to a plough- share, is flat, irregularly quadrilateral, and placed verti- cally between the nasal fossae, presenting two surfaces and four borders. The lateral surfaces form part of the inner wall of the nasal fossae; the superior border, thick and deeply grooved, receives the rostrum of the sphenoid bone; the margins of the groove expand, and are articulated with two small lamellae at the roots of the pterygoid processes. The anterior border, also grooved, presents two portions, into one of which is implanted the descending plate of the eth- moid, and into the other the nasal cartilage. The poste- rior border, dividing the posterior nares, is thin and un- attached ; the inferior is received into the fissure formed by the palate plates of the superior maxillary and palate bones.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 58 gradually decrease, so that the last is very little longer than the first. Their breadth consideiâ€™ed in the whole series diminishes gradually from the first to the twelfth, but in each rib it is greatest towards its sternal extremity. As to their direction in reference to the vertebral column, the first forms almost a right angle with it, and the succeed- ing ones gradually incline downwards, so that their anterior extremity is lower than the posterior. The body of all the ribs, except the first, is as it were twisted on itself, so that their two extremities cannot be made to rest at the same time on a plane surface. These bones present two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The external surface is convex and smooth. The in- ternal is concave, and corresponds with the pleura. The superior border smooth and rounded, gives at- tachment to the intercostal muscles ; the inferior is marked by a groove for the lodgment of the intercostal vessels, and also gives attachment to the intercostal muscles. The 'posterior extremity, which articulates with the spinal column, presents a head, which is rounded and un- divided in the first, eleventh, and twelfth, but in the others it is divided into two articular faces by a slightly marked ridge; the head is supported by a narrow round part, or neck, terminated externally by a tubercle, which is smooth in one part for its articulation, with the transverse process of the dorsal vertebras, and rough in the other, for the in- sertion of the costo-transverse ligament. The anterior extremity is broad, flat, and hollowed at its tip into an oval pit, into which is implanted the cos- tal cartilage. Between the tuberosity and the most convex part of the body of each rib, is a rough line, marking what is termed its angle. The distance of the angle from the tuberosity

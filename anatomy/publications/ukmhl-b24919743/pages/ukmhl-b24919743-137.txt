THE ETHMOID BONE. 113 The Ethmoid Bone. 79. The ethmoid bone, common to the cranium, orbit, and nasal fossae, is of a cuboid figure, presents six surfaces, and is divided into two equal lateral parts by a perpendicular lamella, the superior part of which projects into the skull in the form of a cock’s comb (crista galli), the inferior descends into the naves, forming part of their septum. This lamella may be considered as the fundamental part of the bone to which the two lateral masses are applied. The crista galli, smooth and triangular, rests by its base on the cribriform lamella, its longest side looks backwards, the shortest forwards: the latter in some cases is prolonged into two small bony masses, separated by a fissure, which completes the foramen coecum. The crista galli is as it were embraced by the anterior narrow part of the falx ce- rebri, or rather is inserted between the layers of dura ma- ter uniting to form it. The nasal lamella descends towards the vomer, with which and the nasal cartilage it articulates inferiorly, with the septum of the sphenoidal sinuses posteriorly, and with the ossa nasi, and nasal spine of the frontal bone, ante- riorly. At each side of the crista are the horizontal plates (cri- briform) pierced by a number of foramina, for the trans- mission of the divisions of the olfactory nerve ; but the an- terior ones, which are larger, and sometimes fissures, give passage to the nasal branch of the fifth nerve. Beneath the cribriform plate are placed the lateral masses of the bone, divided into a number of cells (ethmoidal), the exter- nal surface of each mass forming part of the orbit, is flat and smooth (os •planum), articulates anteriorly with the os unguis, posteriorly with the sphenoid and anterior process of the palate bone, superiorly with the orbitar process of the frontal bone, with which it contributes to form the orbi- tar foramina (anterior and posterior) inferiorly with the maxillary bone. i

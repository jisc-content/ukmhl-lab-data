THE KNEE JOINTâ€”ITS SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. 181 responds with the posterior crucial ligament, and anteriorly with the part of the membrane reflected on the ligamentum patellae. If we commence at the superior border of the patella to trace the reflexions of the membrane, we find that it lines the articulating surface of that bone, and a little below its in- ferior border passes directly backwards across the joint, until it reaches the margin of the inter-condyloid articulating sur- face, where it is reflected upwards for some way in front of the femur, forming a cul-de-sac between it and the tendon of the extensor muscles, which it lines as it descends again to the patella, whence we began to trace it. The inferior part of the membrane may be traced from the anterior border of the tibia, backwards upon its articulating surface, as far as the insertion of the posterior crucial ligament, upon which it is reflected upwards to the femur, turning forwards upon it until it meets the superior layer of the funnel-shaped process, guided by which it reaches the liga- mentum patellae, and then is reflected downwards to the tibia, whence we started. But for the existence of the transverse funnel-shaped process, the whole outline of the membrane may be traced in the following way, which will answer for each lateral half of it, omitting the part along the median line, in which the process interposes. From the superior border of the patella, it descends, lining its articulating sur- face ; below its inferior border it corresponds with the li- gamentum patellae, from which it is separated by a consi- derable quantity of adipose matter; on reaching the margin of the tibia, it is reflected over its articulating surfaces, and also on both aspects of the semi-lunar cartilages, giving them a smooth investment; round the crucial ligaments also it forms partial investments, enclosing them as far as their attachments to the femur. The membrane will thus be found to be guided to the articulating surface of that bone at several points, viz. by the two crucial liga- ments, by the funnel-shaped process, and by the external

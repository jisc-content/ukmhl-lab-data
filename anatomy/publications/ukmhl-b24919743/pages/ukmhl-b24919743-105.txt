THE METATARSUS. 81 sus; the name expi'esses their form. In number three, they are distinguished by their numerical order from within outwards. The first is the largest, the second, or middle, the smallest. They articulate behind with the navicular, and in front with the first, second, and third metatarsal bones. In consequence of their excess in length over the second, the first and third, in addition to articulating late- rally with the corresponding sides of that bone, are in ap- position with the base of the second metatarsal bone, which is inserted between them. The inner side of the first is subcutaneous, and the outer side of the third is in relation, by two separate surfaces, with the cuboid and fourth meta- tarsal bones. Attachments of Muscles. The os calcis, by its superior sur- face, to the extensor brevis digitorum pedis; the posterior surface to the common tendon of the gastrocnemius and so- leus (tendo Achillis), and to that of the plantaris ; the inferior surface, on the inner side, to the flexor accessorius, and part of the adductor pollicis; on the outer side to the abductor digiti minimi; and in front to part of the flexor brevis polli- cis ; behind to the flexor brevis digitorum. Os cuboideum, by the inferior surface, to a portion of the abductor pollicis. Os naviculare, by its tuberosity, to a portion of the tendon of the tibialis posticus. Ossa cuneiformia. The first, by its base, to portions of the tendons of the tibialis anticus and posticus, and the second and third to part of the flexor brevis pollicis. The Metatarsus. 57. The second, or middle portion of the foot, is analo- gous to the corresponding portion of the hand (metacarpus), and like it is composed of five bones placed parallel one with the other. They are named according to their nume- rical order, from within outwards. The first, or that sup- porting the great toe, is the shortest, with the exception of G

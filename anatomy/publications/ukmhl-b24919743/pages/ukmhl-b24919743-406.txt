ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 368 the aponeurosis may be raised from without inwards, by which means the serratus posticus is left untouched. The serrati and their connecting membrane may be inspected and removed. The erector spinae and its divisions, the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi, may then be traced from below upwards, by merely passing the handle of the scalpel along the cellular interval which sepa- rates them ; and when the splenius has been detached from the vertebrae and reflected outwards, the transversalis colli and trachelo- mastoideus can be followed along the neck, taking them as con- tinuations of the long dorsal muscles. The complexus should now be raised from the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and drawn outwards, by which means the recti and obliqui capitis are exposed, and also beneath them the spinalis colli. Finally, the spinalis dorsi will be observed between the longissimus dorsi and the spinous processes; and when these muscles are removed, that series of oblique muscular and tendinous fibres is exposed which constitutes the multifidus spinae.

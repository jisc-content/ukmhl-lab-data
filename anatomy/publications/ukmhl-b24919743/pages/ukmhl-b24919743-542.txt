500 CHAPTER VIII. THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 556. The abdomen is the largest cavity in the body; it extends from the diaphragm, which forms its upper boun- dary, to the levatores ani, and from the transversales in front, to the spine, quadrati lumborum, and iliaci behind. In these structures, which form the walls of the cavity, several apertures exist for the transmission of parts into and out of'it. Superiorly there are three in the diaphragm, for the aorta, oesophagus, and vena cava; inferiorly there are two at each side for the crural vessels, and spermatic cord; in front there is one—the umbilicus, for the umbi- lical arteries and vein. To these may be added the several interstices and apertures, which give passage to the obtu- rator, sciatic, pudic, and gluteal vessels. 557. The organs contained in the abdomen are divisible into three sets, viz. the digestive, the urinary, and part of the generative. The first class includes the stomach and intestines, the spleen, the liver, the pancreas, and the lac- teal vessels, with their glands; the second comprises the kidneys and supra-renal capsules, with the ureters and bladder; and the third—the spermatic vessels and ducts, with the vesiculas seminales in the male, and the uterus, with the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, together with the vagina, in the female. Having already stated the division of the abdomen into regions, and the views which influ- enced its adoption, (sect. 329) we shall here briefly enume- rate the organs, or parts of organs, contained in each region, previously to entering on their detailed description.

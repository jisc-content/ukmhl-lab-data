THE SACRUM. 61 three pieces, which usually remain separate to an advanced period of life. The Sacrum. 41. The sacrum, when the body is in the erect position, is placed at the superior and posterior part of the pelvis, beneath the last lumbar vertebra, which it supports, above the coccyx, and between the ossa innominata, into which it is inserted, in some measure like a key-stone into an arch. Its figure is triangular in its general outline ; concave an- teriorly, convex posteriorly. We consider successively its surfaces, borders, and extremities. The anterior surface, flat from side to side, is concave from above downwards, and marked by four transverse lines, indicating its original division into five pieces; late- rally it presents four foramina for the transmission of the anterior branches of the sacral nerves. These are directed outwards, and diminish gradually in size from above down- wards ; external to them is a depressed surface for the at- tachment of the pyramidalis muscle. The 'posterior surface is convex, and presents along the median line four small eminences, usually connected so as to form a ridge, these are rudiments of the spinous pro- cesses ; and beneath them is a triangular groove, marking the termination of the sacral canal: at each side of the median line are two grooves, pierced by the posterior sacral foramina, which are much smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior branches of the sacral nerves. The borders, or lateral surfaces of the sacrum, present two distinct parts, one superior, large and irregular, which in the fresh state is covered with cartilage, and articulated with the os innominatum ; the other inferior, thin, and narrowing to a point, gives attachment to the sacro-sciatic ligament. A small excavation terminates this border, which with the corresponding extremity of the coccyx, forms a notch for the transmission of the last sacral nerve.

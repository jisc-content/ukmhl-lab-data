108 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. gives attachment to the temporal and corrugator supercilii muscles. The Temporal Bone. 77. Situated at the lateral and inferior part of the skull. To facilitate its description it may be divided into three parts, adopting the division which obtains in infancy, before the ossification is complete. One is superior, flat, scaly, and named the squamous portion; another posterior, rough, and thick, the mastoid; the third internal and intermediate, the petrous. The squamous portion by its external surface forms part of the temporal fossa, and is bounded above by an arched border, below by a horizontal process, called zigoma. This at its base presents two roots, one anterior transverse bounds the glenoid fossa, the other, continued horizontally backwards, also bifurcates, one part turning inwards to the glenoid fissure, whilst the other gradually subsides, yet marks the sepaiâ€™ation between the squamous and mastoid portions of the bone. The glenoid fossa, inclosed by these roots, is elongated from without inwards, and divided into two parts by a fissure (jissura Glasseri) which transmits the chorda tympani nerve, laxator tympani muscle, and gives attachment to the processus gracilis of the malleus. The part before the fissure is smooth, and articulates with the lower jaw, the remainder lodges a process of the paro- tid gland. The mastoid, or nipple-shaped part, bounded by an angular border, is rough externally, and overhangs a groove for the attachment of the digastricus muscle: in- ternally it is hollowed for the lateral sinus, and pierced by a venous foramen opening into the sinus. The petrous part, forming a triangular pyramid, project- ing into the base of the skull forwards and inwards, pre- sents a base, an apex (truncated), three surfaces, and three borders. In the base is situated the meatus auditorius ex- ternus, which is dire ted forwards and inwards, and leads

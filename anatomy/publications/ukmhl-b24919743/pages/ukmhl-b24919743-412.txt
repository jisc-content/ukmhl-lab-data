ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 371 humerus, the fibrous capsule of the shoulder joint, the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, biceps, subscapularis, coraco-acromion ligament, the exter- nal rotator muscles, and the triceps; by the anterior bor- der, with the pectoralis major, from which it is separated by the cephalic vein, and more inferiorly with the biceps; the posterior border is free. 376. The supra-spinatus is placed at the superior part of the shoulder in the supra-spinous fossa of the scapula. Its form is elongated and triangular. It arises from the posterior two-thirds of the fossa above mentioned, and is inserted into the superior surface of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Direction—oblique from behind forwards, and from below upwards: structure—tendinous at the hu- meral end, fleshy in the rest of its extent: relations—by the outer surface, with the trapezius, coraco-acromion liga- ment and deltoid; by the inner surface with the scapula and the ligamentum proprium posticum, with supra-scapular nerve and vessels, omo-hyoideus muscle, and the fibrous capsule of the shoulder joint, with which it is intimately united. 377. The infraspinatus occupies the chief part of the infra-spinous fossa, and arises from the lower surface of the spine of the scapula, and from all the convex part of its dorsum. The fibres converge to a tendon, at first concealed in a great degree within the substance of the muscle, but which afterwards proceeds forwards over the capsular liga- ment of the joint, to be inserted into the upper border of the great tuberosity of the humerus. Direction from behind forwards, the superior fibres being nearly horizontal, the inferior ones converging to meet them: structure—tendinous at the humeral end, and for some way along its centre, fleshy in the rest of its extent: relations—the posterior surface is covered, partly by the deltoid, the latissimus, and trapezius, a small part also being sub-cutaneous; the ante-

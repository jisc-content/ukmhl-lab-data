ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 460 upper jaw, near the second incisor and canine teeth, to the cartilage of the ala of the nose ; it lies between the mucous membrane and the muscular structure of the lip, with which its fibres are closely connected; this double con- nexion enables it to depress the lip as well as the nasal car- tilage. Opposed in situation and action to the elevator muscles are the following. 505. The triangularis oris, or depressor anguli, lies at the side and lower part of the face, being extended to the angle of the mouth from the lower jaw. It arises from the lower border of the inferior maxilla, and from its external surface. Its fibres pass upwards, so as to form a narrow process, which is inserted into the angle of the mouth, by becoming blended with the other muscles in that situation. It is covered by the skin and platisma myoides, and at its inser- tion, by the zigomaticus major, under which its fibres pass; it conceals part of the buccinator and depressor labii infe- rioris. , 506. The depressor labii inferioris (quadratus menti) is a small square muscle, lying nearer to the symphysis of the chin than the preceding muscle, by which it is partly con- cealed. It arises from the forepart of the inferior maxilla, and thence ascends to be inserted into the lower lip, its fibres becoming blended with those of the orbicularis oris, and also having previously united with those of its fellow of the opposite side. It presents rather a peculiar appearance when dissected, owing to a quantity of yellow adipose matter being deposited in the interstices of its fibres. 507. The levator labii inferioris arises from the alveolar border of the lower jaw, close to the incisor teeth, and be- comes blended with the orbicularis and substance of the lip. This pair of muscles occupies the interval between the two depressores. They are short and flat. The names of these muscles are sufficiently expressive of their actions.

566 CHAPTER IX. THE THORAX. 617. The thorax is somewhat conical in its form, and intended to lodge the central organs of circulation and respiration. It is intermediate not only in size and situa- tion, but also in the structure of its walls, between the abdomen and the cranium, the one being composed almost entirely of soft parts, and the other an osseous case, whilst the thorax consists of muscular and osseous parts in nearly equal proportions. The intercostal spaces are filled on each side by two orders of muscular fibres, dis- posed, in lamella?, one within the other. 618. 1. The external intercostal muscles are placed between the contiguous borders of each pair of ribs. There are, therefore, eleven such muscular lamellae on each side, the direction of the fibres of all being obliquely downwards and forwards. Their extent in each instance is from the tubercles of the ribs to the external extremity of their cartilages. 2. The internal intercostal muscles, commencing at the sternum, in the spaces between the true ribs, and in the rest, from the anterior extremities of their cartilages, extend as far as their angles, the direc- tion of their fibres being obliquely downwards and back- wards. 619. The levatores costarum are narrow, tendinous, and fleshy fasciculi, which extend obliquely downwards and forwards (in this particular resembling the external inter- costals) from the extremities of the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, to be inserted into the margins of the ribs, between their angles and tubercles.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 466 muscle, and pierces the buccinator and mucous membrane of the mouth, opposite the second dens molaris of the upper jaw. Its direction across the face may be indicated by a line drawn from the lower margin of the concha to midway between the red margin of the lip and the ala of the nose. 515. The submaxillary gland lies behind and beneath the ramus of the jaw, resting on the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and separated from the parotid by the stylo-maxillary membrane, where it is covered by the skin and platisma, and invested by a lamella of cellular membrane. The facial artery runs in a groove on its upper surface. A process of the gland turns round the posterior border of the mylo- hyoideus muscle, lying beneath the mucous membrane. Its duct (ductus Whartoni) follows the same course, and is directed along the side of the genio-liyo-glossus muscle, towards the side of the fraenum of the tongue, where it terminates. 516. The sublingual gland is much smaller than the others, and of an oval form. As its name implies, it lies beneath the tongue, close to the side of its fraenum, resting against the genio-hyo-glossus muscle, supported by the mylo- hyoideus, and in close contact with the duct and deep process of the submaxillary gland. Its secretion is poured into the mouth by several minute orifices which open be- neath the tongue on each side. Sometimes one or two small ducts join with that of the submaxillary gland. Section III. ARTERIES OF THE NECK AND FACE. 517. The arteries of the neck consist of the carotid and subclavian trunks, the latter being extended in a curved form across its lower part, the former mounting obliquely upwards. The two carotids, whilst in the neck are, as nearly as may be, similar in their course, size, and relations; but they differ in their length and mode of origin. The

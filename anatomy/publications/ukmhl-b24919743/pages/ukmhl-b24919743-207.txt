PERONEO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. 183 ternal tuberosity of the tibia; it is covered and strength- ened by the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris; 2, by a posterior ligament similarly disposed behind the articula- tion, but stronger and thicker ; 3, by a synovial membrane, which lines the articulating surfaces of the bones and liga- ments. 182. The interosseous ligament, which connects the hoo- dies of the tibia and fibula, flat and membranous, is com- posed of a series of parallel fibres, extended obliquely be- tween the external angle of the tibia, and the ridge on the adjacent surface of the fibula. The direction of the fibres is outwards and downwards; the membrane they compose is broader above than below, and presents in the former si- tuation an elongated opening for the transmission of the anterior tibial vessels, and inferiorly a smaller aperture for the passage of the anterior branch of the peroneal ar- tery. 183. The inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula pre- sent two articulating surfaces, of which that of the former is concave, and receives the latter, which is convex, both being covered with cartilage. These are connected by four ligaments and a synovial membrane. 1. The anterior ligament is a flat band of fibres, extend- ed obliquely between the heads of the bones, the direc- tion of its fibres being downwards from the tibia to the fibula. 2. The posterior ligament, somewhat triangular, is simi- larly disposed behind the articulation; its external surface is covered by the peronei muscles. 3. The transverse ligament, longer but narrower than the former, with which its fibres are closely connected, extends from the head of the fibula to that of the tibia; it forms the posterior boundary of the ankle joint. 4. The inferior interosseous ligament consists of some short dense fibres, which connect the heads of the bones, as the great interosseous ligament does their bodies, it can-

Will a difference of a half hour, or of an hour in its duration, influence its ultimate result? Abundant evi- dence may be adduced to shew that it may, nay, that it has done so in several instances. When a patient has made up his mind to submit to an operation, he does so with a certain degree of consciousness of the risk which he en- counters, and of the sufferings he is about to endure. If the operation be executed with great precision and cele- rity, the degree of suffering during its performance is far less than he had been prepared to expect, and when it is over, it may readily be perceived that confidence and self- gratulation at once take the place of doubt and despond- ency, and that a sense of security springs up in his mind, which exerts a most beneficial influence on the subsequent progress of the case. Another individual may happen to be placed under different hands, is harassed by a slow and protracted operation, begins to doubt the skill of his surgeon, even whilst it is being performed, and to de- spair of obtaining the relief which he had so anxiously anticipated: even when the operation is completed, and he is replaced in his bed, confidence still forsakes him, for he cannot bring himself to believe that any human being could recover after sufferings so protracted, and after sustaining such a degree of derangement and injury.

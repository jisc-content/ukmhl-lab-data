THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 115 rior maxillary bones; with the sphenoid, the palate bones, the vomer, and inferior spongy bones. Muscular attachments, none. The Superior Maxillary Bone. 80. This bone is very irregular; it presents an external con- vex surface, corresponding with the anterior and lateral parts of the face; another internal, flat, bounding the nasal fossae; one superior, smooth, and inclined inwards, form- ing the floor of the orbit, and surmounted internally by a triangular process, forming the side of the nose; lastly, a surface which projects horizontally inwards, to form the arch of the palate. At the junction of the external and inferior surfaces is a thick, dependent margin, for the lodgement of the teeth; to this, as to a common point of union, all the other parts of the bone may be referred. The alveolar border, thick, semicircular, convex exter- nally, concave internally, is pierced along its margin by a number of deep pits, {alveoli,) into which the teeth are in- serted. From this border the external side ascends upwards to the margin of the orbit, presenting some depressions and elevations; but at its fore part it is interrupted and exca- vated into a hollow, which, with a similar one in the corres- ponding bone, forms the anterior nares. This excavation is surmounted by the ascending or nasal process, prolonged as far as the frontal bone, with which it articulates. The external surface of this process, slightly grooved, gives at- tachment to the orbicularis palpebrarum and levator labii superioris alseque nasi. The internal, or nasal surface, somewhat concave, presents a rough line, running from be- fore, backwards, which articulates with the inferior spongy bone; above this is a depression corresponding with the middle meatus, and, towards the summit, a rough surface, which closes in the anterior ethmoidal cells.

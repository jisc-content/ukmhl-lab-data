ELEMENTS OP ANATOMY. 384 between the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, resting on the flexor sublimis. 389. The flexor carpi ulnaris lies superficial along the ulnar border of the fore-arm, being extended from the inner condyle to the inner margin of the wrist. It arises by two short processes, the angular interval between which transmits the ulnar nerve. One of these is attached to the inner condyle, the other to the border of the olecranon. The muscle is also connected, for some distance, to the in- ner side of the ulna by a dense fascia. The muscular fibres from these different points of attachment terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the pisiform bone, and slightly into the base of the fifth metacarpal bone. Rela- tionâ€”the anterior surface is covered by the skin and fas- cia, the posterior rests on the flexor profundus, and over- laps the ulnar nerve and artery. 390. The flexor digitorum sublimis, vel perforatus, is placed at the anterior part of the fore-arm, between the preceding muscles and the flexor profundus. It is flat and broad in the upper part, but inferiorly divides into four tendons. It arises from the inner condyle, by the common tendon, from the internal lateral ligament, from the anterior surface of the coronoid process, and from the oblique line extended from the tubercle of the radius to the insertion of the pronator teres. The fleshy belly enlarges towards the middle of the arm, but diminishes somewhat before its division. The four tendons pass under the annular liga- ment of the wrist, resting on the flexor profundus ; and di- verge as they proceed to their destinations. Each of these, accompanied by a tendon from the flexor profundus, enters a fibrous sheath, that binds it down to the palmar surface of the finger, and opposite the first phalanx it presents a fissured interval, which transmits the tendon of the deep flexor. Finally, after expanding somewhat, and forming a groove, by its palmar surface, which partly encloses the ac-

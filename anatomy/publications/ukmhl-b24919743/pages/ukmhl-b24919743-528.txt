ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 486 tery, it subsequently lies parallel with, and to the outside of the common carotid, as far as the sternal end of the clavicle, where it joins at an angle with the subclavian vein, and so forms the vena innominata. Several large branches terminate in the internal jugular vein. The occipital vein opens into it from behind, and those corresponding with the anterior branches of the ca- rotid artery from before. The facial vein commences by a straight branch, which descends from the fore-head to the root of the nose. Having reached the angle of the eye, it comes into contact with the terminal branches of the facial artery, whose course it follows, receiving ramusculi as it descends along the side of the face. From the margin of the jaw-bone the vein inclines downwards and outwards to open into the internal jugular vein, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The lingual and superior thyroid veins follow the course of the arteries of the same name, both terminating in the internal jugular, as do like- wise the inferior thyroid veins, which arise from the lower * part of the thyroid gland, and descend on the fore part of the trachea, but incline outwards previously to their ter- mination. Lymphatics of the Face and Neck. 546. The lymphatic vessels of the face and neck consist of a deep and superficial set, which in their course follow that of the vessels described in the preceding section. The superficial lymphatics of the face accompany the facial vein, and with it sink into the neck below the lower jaw, where they pass through some superficial glands, and main- tain communications with the deep lymphatic vessels. Those from the side of the head take the course of the temporal vessels, and, at the angle of the jaw, join with the facial set, or merely communicate with them. From this point two or three trunks descend by the side of the trachea, and along with the external jugular vein, to termi-

89 THE CLAVICLE. The Clavicle. The clavicle is extended, transversely, between the acro- mion process of the scapula and the summit of the sternum, which it serves to connect; its direction, however, is not exactly horizontal, the acromial end being slightly elevated. Elongated, and irregular in its form, this bone is curved somewhat like an italic f, the degree of the curvature being less in young and female subjects than in male adults ; it is prismatic and triangular towards the sternal, broad and flat towards the scapular extremity, and divided into a body and two extremities. The superior surface of the body is prin- cipally subcutaneous ; the inferior surface presents, near the sternal extremity, inequalities for the attachment of the costo-clavicular ligament; in the centre, a longitudinal de- pression, in which is observed the foramen for the entrance of the medullary vessels, and, more externally, a rough ob- lique line, to which the coraco-clavicular ligaments are at- tached ; its anterior border is broad and convex towards the sternal, thin and concave towards the scapular extre- mity ; the posterior border presents, of course, the opposite arrangement of curvatures. The internal extremity is in- clined downwards and forwards; it is considerably thicker than the other parts of the bone, and terminates in a tri- angular unequal surface, which is convex from above down- wards, concave from behind forwards; this is tipped with cartilage, and articulates with the sternum; its entire cir- cumference gives attachment to ligaments. The scapular ex- tremity is inclined backwards and upwards, and articulates with the acromion by a narrow surface which is covered with cartilage. Attachments of Muscles. The clavicle gives attachment, by the superior surface of its sternal extremity, to the sterno-cleido- mastoid ; the longitudinal depression, on its inferior surface, to the subclavius ; the anterior border, by its sternal half, to the pectoralis major, by its acromial third to the deltoid ; the posterior border, by its acromial third, to the trapezius.

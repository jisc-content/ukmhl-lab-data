150 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. coincide with that of motion, rotation is prevented, but circumduction and opposition are freely performed. When these are limited in extent, as in the sterno-clavicular arti- culation, it arises rather from the accessory ligaments of the part than from any impediment in the surfaces of the bones ; and, if motion in one direction be more free than in another, as in the digital phalanges with the metacarpus, where flexion and extension are more free than abduction and adduction, it proceeds partly from the existence of the lateral ligaments, and partly from the greater power of the flexor and extensor muscles. Though in the knee and elbow the axis of motion coincides with that of the bones, yet their movement is confined to two directions, viz. to flexion and extension. In these joints all other motions besides those just mentioned are prevented by the breadth of the articulating surfaces, and by their mode of adapta- tion ; however, when they are flexed, some degree of late- ral motion, and also of circumduction, can be performed, as any individual may ascertain by resting his elbow on a table, when he will find that the fore-arm may be made to describe a cone with its summit at the olecranon and base, towards the fingers. The Articulations of the Trunk. 100. The vertebrae are connected at every point of their circumference by ligaments, or fibro-cartilage, and in some parts by synovial membranes, the former serving to retain them in their situation, the latter to facilitate motion be- tween the different bones. The bodies are joined by two ligamentous bands, extending the whole length of the chain, and also by the inter-vertebral substances. 1. The anterior common ligament (ligamentum commune anterius, Weitbrecht. Soemmering,) placed on the front of the bodies of the vertebrae, reaches from the axis to the first bone of the sacrum, becoming broader as it descends. The superficial fibres extend from a given vertebra to the

192 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. all the rest pass downwards and forwards, and terminate in tendinous fibres, which form a broad aponeurosis, that covers the entire front of the abdomen, and terminates by uniting with that of the corresponding muscle along the median line, from the ensiform cartilage to the sym- physis pubis. The inferior fibres of this aponeurosis are closely aggregated together, and extended across from the anterior superior spinous process of the ileum, to the pubis, in the form of a tense band, which is called Poupart's ligament. Near the pubis the fibres diverge from one another, leaving between them a triangular interval for the passage of the spermatic coi’d in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The direction of this interval is upwards and outwards, its base being formed by the crista of the pubis, and the sides by the two sets of diverging fibres, called its pillars, of which one is attached to the anterior surface of the symphysis pubis interlacing with the corresponding fibres of the opposite muscle, the other external and inferior is fixed to the spinous process of the pubis, whilst a third portion reflected backwards and out- wards, from the latter, is inserted along the pectineal line, being triangular in its form, and nearly horizontal in its di- rection, and ordinarily denominated Gimbernat's ligament. The direction of the fibres of this muscle is obliquely downwards and inwards: structure, — fleshy, where it is attached to the thorax and ileum, aponeurotic in the rest of its extent: relations,—externally with the skin and su» perficial fascia, internally with the cartilages of the ribs, obliquus internus, rectus, and pyramidalis muscles; poste- riorly its free border is covered partly by the latissimus dorsi. 203. The obliquus internus, (obliquus ascendens; ilio- abdominal, Chauss.; ilio-lumbo-costi-abdominal, Dumas) si- tuated beneath the preceding muscle, is of an irregularly quadrilateral form. It arises inferiorly from the iliac half, not unfrequently from two thirds of the inner surface of

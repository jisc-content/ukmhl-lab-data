THE ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. 157 false ribs, where they articulate with one another. These can be readily demonstrated by slicing offâ€™a little of the an- terior surface of the sternum and cartilages. A thin fasci- culus of fibres connects the cartilage of the seventh rib with the xiphoid cartilage, and thence called the costo-xi- phoid ligament. The three pieces of the sternum are con- nected by a layer of fibro-cartilage placed between their contiguous borders ; and, on the anterior and posterior sur- faces, some scattered fibres may be observed running longi- tudinally from above downwards, which serve to strengthen their connexion. These are sometimes called the anterior and posterior sternal ligaments. The Articulation of the Lower Jaw. The lower jaw articulates at each side by one of its con- dyles with the glenoid cavity, and with the smooth surface on the anterior root of the zigomatic process. By means of an inter-articular cartilage a double joint is formed at each side, with distinct synovial membranes, so that the tempo- ro-maxillary articulation is provided with four of these shut sacs. 116. The external lateral ligament is a short fasciculus of fibres, attached above to the external surface of the zigo- ma, and to the tubercle at the bifurcation of its root, below to the external surface, and posterior border of the neck of the condyle, its fibres being directed downwards and back- wards. Externally it is covered by the parotid gland, in- ternally it is in relation with the inter-articular cartilage and synovial membranes. 117. The internal lateral ligament, thin, loose, and elon- gated, extends from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone downwards, and a little forwards, to be attached to the lower border of the dental foramen, where it is somewhat expanded. Its external surface is in relation superiorly with the external pterygoid muscle, and in the rest of its extent with the ramus of the jaw, from which it is separat-

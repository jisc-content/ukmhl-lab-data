THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE CRANIUM. 153 gular fibrous bands (ligamenta processuum obliquorum, Weit.) forming a capsule outside the synovial membranes. These are longer and more loose in the cervical than in the dorsal or lumbar regions. The Articulations of the Cranium. 104. The cranium is articulated, 1, with the atlas; 2, with the axis ; 3, with the lower jaw. The articulation of the cranium with the atlas takes place between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articulating processes of that vertebra, which are connected by ligaments and synovial membranes. 105. The anterior occipito-atloidean ligament (membrana annuli anterioris vertebrce prirnce) extends from the anterior border of the occipital foramen between the condyles, to the margin of the arch of the atlas between its superior ar- ticulating processes. This is thin, broad, and membra- nous, but in the median line, a sort of accessory ligament is placed in front of it, which is thick, round, and composed of vertical fibres, attached above to the surface of the basi- lar process, and below to the small tubercle on the front of the atlas. The anterior surface of these ligaments is co- vered by the recti antici muscles, the posterior covers the odontoid process and its ligaments. 106. The posterior occipito-atloidean ligament, also broad and membranous, is attached superiorly to all that part of the margin of the occipital foramen which is behind the condyles, and inferiorly to the adjacent border of the posterior arch of the atlas. It consists of two lamellae, winch are united at their superior attachment, but soon di- vide, one becoming blended with the dura mater, which lines the canal; the other inserted into the arch of the at- las. The posterior surface of the ligament is in apposition with the posterior recti and superior oblique muscles, the anterior looks towards the vertebral canal. The articulation of the occipital bone with the axis is ef-

182 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. margin of the semi-lunar cartilages; from these points it expands over the condyles, and after ascending for some way in front of the femur, (forming a cul-de sac between it and the tendon of the extensor muscles) it passes down- wards to the margin of the patella, from which we proceed- ed to trace its reflexions. In the enumeration of the ligaments of the knee joint, no mention has been here made of a fibrous capsule, as an in- vestment distinct from the other fibrous structures of the joint. It is not usually described in anatomical demonstra- tions, and no notice of it occurs in the works of Meckel, Portal, Cloquet, or B. Cooper. A capsular ligament is how- ever attributed to this articulation by Soemmering, Weit- brecht, and Fyfe. The capsular ligament or membrane (membrana capsularis articuli genu) arises in front from the whole circumference of the articulating extremity of the fe- mur, at some distance from its cartilaginous coating, behind from the border of the inter-condyloid fossa, from which it descends, to be inserted into the rough border which sur- rounds the head of the tibia. The membrane is also in- serted into the margins of the patella and its superior and inferior ligamentous connexions, so that this bone forms part of the capsule of the joint. It is very thin, but is strengthened by the fascia of the limb, and the surrounding- aponeurotic structures. The Peroneo-tihial Articulation. 181. The superior and inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula are connected by ligaments and synovial mem- branes, and the shafts of the bones are maintained in rela- tion by an interosseous ligament. The contiguous extre- mities of these bones present superiorly two flat oval sur- faces covered with cartilage, which are closely applied to one another, and retained in situ, 1, by an anterior liga- ment, which is a broad, flat band of fibres, passing obliquely upwards and inwards, from the head of the fibula to the in-

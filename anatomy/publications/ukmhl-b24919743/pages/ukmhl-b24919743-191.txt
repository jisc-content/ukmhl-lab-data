167 THE WRIST JOINT. The Wrist Joint. 139. This articulation is formed by the radius and trian- gular cartilage above, and the three first bones of the car- pus below. The articular aspect of the former, when viewed in the fresh state, presents an oval and slightly concave sur- face, its greatest breadth being from side to side. The surface of the radius is divided into two parts, by a line ex- tending from before backwards, so that these, together with the cartilage, present three articular surfaces, one for each carpal bone. The scaphoid, semi-lunar, and cunei- form bones are articulated together, so as to form a round- ed convex surface, which is received into the concavity above described. Four ligaments and a synovial membrane retain these parts in their situation. 140. The internal lateral ligament passes directly down- wards from the extremity of the styloid process of the ulna, to be attached to the cuneiform bone; it also sends some fibres to the annular ligament and pisiform bone. Its form is that of a rounded cord; its inner surface is in contact with the triangular fibro-cartilage, the part above the cartilage being lined by the membrana sacciformis, that below it by the synovial membrane of the radio-carpal articulation. 141. The external lateral ligament extends from the sty- loid process of the radius, to a rough surface on the sca- phoid bone, some of its fibres being prolonged to the tra- pezium, and also to the annular ligament of the wrist. 142. The anterior ligament, broad and membranous, is attached to the rough border of the carpal extremity of the radius, and to the base of its styloid process, from which its fibres pass down to be inserted into the anterior surface of the scaphoid, semi-lunar, and cuneiform bones. It is pierced by several foramina for the transmission of vessels ; one of its surfaces is lined by the synovial membrane of the joint, the other is in contact with the tendons of the flexor muscles.

121 THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The Inferior Spongy Bone. 86. The inferior spongy bone, or turbinated bone, so called from some resemblance to the lateral half of an elongated bivalve shell, extends from before backwards, along the side of the nasal fossae: slightly convoluted, it presents an inter- nal convex surface, projecting into the nasal fossae; an ex- ternal concave, which arches over the inferior meatus; the superior border articulates with the ascending process of the maxillary bone before, and with the palate bone behind ; in the centre with the os unguis ; and, by a hooked process, with the side of the antrum; the inferior border is free, slightly twisted, and dependent. The Inferior Maxillary Bone. 87. The inferior maxilla, convex in its general outline, and shaped somewhat like a horse-shoe, is situated at the infe- rior part of the face, and is usually considered as divisible into a middle larger portionâ€”its body, and two branches, or rami. The body is placed horizontally; its external sur- face is convex, and marked at the middle by a vertical line indicating the original division of the bone into two lateral parts, and thence named its symphysis. On each side of the symphysis, and just below the incisor teeth, is a super- ficial depression (the incisor fossa), and, more externally, a foramen, which transmits the terminal branches of the den- tal nerve and artery. A linear eminence may be observed to extend obliquely upwards and outwards from the sym- physis to the anterior border of the ramus; it is named the external oblique line, and is intended to give attachment to muscles. The internal surface of the body is concave, and marked at its centre by a depression corresponding with the symphysis; at each side of which are two prominent tuber- cles placed one above the other, and affording attachment to muscles. Beneath them are two slight depressions for the digastric muscles; and from the lower margin may be

103 THE SKULL. also to two interossei: the fourth, to two dorsal interossei and one palmar: the fifth, to the extensor carpi ulnaris, and adductor minimi digiti. 3. To the bones of the fingers. Those of the first range of the four fingers give attachment by their lateral borders to the tendinous sheaths of the flexor tendons; their dorsal surface is covered by the expansion of the extensor tendons. The bones of the second row give insertion at their dorsal surface to the tendons of the extensor communis, with which those of the lumbricales and interossei may be said to be blended; the tendons of the flexor sublimis are inserted into their bases at the palmar surface: the third set gives inser- tion to the tendons of the flexor profundus ; the fibres of the extensor are also continued on their dorsal aspect. The first phalanx of the thumb gives insertion to the ex- tensor primi internodii, to the flexor brevis, to the adduc- tor and abductor pollicis: the second phalanx to the flexor longus, and to the extensor secundi internodii. Of the Skull. The skull is of a spheroidal figure, compressed on the sides; broader behind than before, and supported by its base on the vertebral column. It is divided by anatomists into two parts, the cranium and face, the former being com- posed of eight bones, viz. the occipital, two parietal, fhe frontal, two temporal, the sphenoid, and the ethmoid; the latter is made up of fourteen bones, viz. two superior max- illary, two malar, two ossa nasi, two ossa palati, two ossa unguis, two inferior turbinated bones, the vomer, and infe- rior maxilla; the fourteenth is the frontal bone, which is common to the cranium and face. The three bones of the ear are not included in this enumeration, as they belong ra- ther to a special organ than to the skeleton, considered as the frame-work of the body. The Occipital Bone. 74.

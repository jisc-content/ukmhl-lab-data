Let us then take up the latter also at this point, noting the point at which we do so, and we shall find,—first, that the upper layer of the lesser omentum, after passing in front of the stomach, and forming the upper and under layers of the great omentum, be- comes attached to the transverse colon, and finally, after forming the inferior lamella of its meso-colon, becomes continuous at the root of the mesentery with the part (A); and secondly,—that the under layer, after having passed through a complete labyrinth, will lead us back again to the posterior lamella of the lesser omentum, from which we began to trace it, thus shewing a continuity in every direction. The two lamellae of the lesser omentum (the hepatic vessels interposing) proceed down to the lesser curvature of the stomach, where they separate and pass, one before the other, behind "that organ, until they reach its great convexity, where they again come into contact, after having inclosed the epiploic vessels. Placed thus in apposition, the two lamellae descend to the bottom of the abdomen, where they are reflected back on themselves as far as the transverse colon, and so form the great omentum. On reaching the colon, the returning layers diverge and inclose it, one passing before, the other behind it, after which the latter (the inferior one) is directed back to the spine, forming the under layer of the transverse meso-colon, and, at the root of the mesentery, is continuous with the portion (A). But the other, namely, that which lies before the colon, inclines obliquely up- wards, forming the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon, and proceeds in front of the transverse part of the duodenum, the pancreas, the great vessels, and crura of the diaphragm, from which it is reflected to the surface of the liver, which it invests as far as its transverse fissure, where it descends behind the vessels to the point from which we set out. Having already indicated the mode in which the falx, or great suspensory ligament of the liver is formed, it remains only to add, that at the point at which the peritonaeum is reflected from the diaphragm to its upper border, three folds are formed, one in the middle, called the coronary ligament, the others at the sides, named lateral ligaments. The great omentum is the broad floating process .

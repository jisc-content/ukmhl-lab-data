119 THE PALATE BONE. Its form somewhat resembles that of the letter L, one part being horizontal, the other vertical. The former, qua- drilateral, articulates anteriorly with the palate plate of the maxillary bone; internally, with its fellow of the opposite side; posteriorly it is concave, presents at the inner angle a pointed process, (the palate spine); externally it unites at right angles with the vertical portion of the bone. The in- ferior surface, forming part of the roof of the mouth, is un- equal, and marked by a transverse ridge, and presents an oval foramen, being the inferior termination of the pos- terior palatine canal, which transmits the descending pala- tine nerves and accompanying vessels. At the junction of the horizontal and vertical portions, is situated a thick, rough tubercle, (tuberosity, pyramidal process,) projecting downwards and backwards. This is marked by three vertical grooves ; the two lateral ones are rough, and receive the inferior borders of the pterygoid processes, the middle one smooth, corresponds with and completes the groove between the pterygoid plates. The vertical portion presents two surfaces ; one internal, (nasal), is divided into two parts by a transverse ridge, which articulates with the inferior spongy bone ; that below the ridge forms part of the inferior meatus, that above of the middle. The external, rough and unequal, is divided by a vertical groove, which is completed into a canal, (posterior-palatine canal) by the maxillary bone. The pos- terior part of this surface articulates with the inner surface of the maxillary bone ; the anterior, thin and scaly, with the side of the antrum ; superiorly the vertical portion is bifid, and branches into two processes. Of these, the anterior and external one presents, at its termination, five surfaces ; of which the superior, smooth and triangular, forms part of the floor of the orbit; the ante- rior rests against the maxillary bone; the posterior is ra- ther a rough border, which overhangs the spheno-palatine foramen; the internal one, rough and cellular, completes

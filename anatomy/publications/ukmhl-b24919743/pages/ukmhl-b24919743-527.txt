The blood from the cranium and face is returned by two trunks, differing in their mode of origin, position, and size. The external jugular vein, much smaller than the internal, and comparatively superficial in its course, commences a little below the zigoma, and in the substance of the parotid gland, being formed by the junction at that point of the temporal and internal maxillary veins. 1. The temporal vein in direction and course corresponds with the artery of that name, having commenced at the side of the head by several branches, which converge as they descend, and form a single vessel. 2. The internal maxillary vein bears a similar relation to the internal maxillary artery, and commences by ramusculi, which receive the residue of the blood circulated by that vessel and its numerous branches. The trunk of the vein lies near the corresponding artery, behind the ramus of the jaw, where it unites at an angle with the temporal vein. In this situation we find the stylo- mastoid vein also, after having descended from the cavity of the tympanum, and the auricularis posterior from the ex- ternal ear. The external jugular vein formed by the con- flux of these vessels, descends at first through the sub- stance of the parotid gland, and afterwards between the sterno-mastoid and platisma; finally, after having passed along the posterior border of the former, it dips beneath it, and terminates in the subclavian vein. In this course it re- ceives, at intervals, branches from the superficial parts of the neck. 545. The internal jugular vein is of considerable size, and deeply seated in its entire course. It commences in the jugular fossa, being part of the foramen lacerum pos- terius, where it is continuous with the lateral sinus of the brain. Placed at first close to the internal carotid aiv

COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. 237 erful instrument of propulsion in the different movements and actions of the lower extremity. Section II. ARTERIES OF THE ABDOMINAL PARIETES, AND LOWER EX- TREMITY. We commence the description of the vessels which sup- ply the walls of the abdomen, and the lower extremities, at the point at which the aorta divides into the common iliac trunks. The bifurcation of the aorta takes place usually on the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, a little to the left of the middle line. The point here indicated, will be found on a level with a line drawn from one crista ilei to the other, and may be transfixed by another passed hori- zontally backwards from the left margin of the umbilicus, to the vertebral column, in the erect position of the body. It should, however, he observed, that the division not unfre- quently takes place higher up or lower down, by about the breadth of half a vertebra. 265. The common iliac trunks (arteries iliac re communes') resulting from the bifurcation of the aorta, diverge as they pass downwards and outwards to the sacro-iliac symphysis, where each of them divides into two primary branches, the internal and external iliac arteries, the former being distri- buted to the viscera of the pelvis, and the soft parts on its external surface, as well as to the perinaeum, whilst the latter is prolonged into the lower extremity, after having sent two important branches to the parietes of the abdomen. The common iliac arteries of opposite sides present some differences in their direction, length, and relations to con- tiguous parts, which deserve notice. The vessel on the right side passes off* more abruptly than the left, and is somewhat longer, as the division of the aorta occurs to the left of the middle line. The right one also lies obliquely on the last lumbar vertebra, from which it is separated by both the common iliac veins, as they terminate in the cava.

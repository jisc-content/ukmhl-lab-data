570 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The Lungs. 623. The lungs constitute the organ of respiration, and are two in number; they occupy the lateral parts of the cavity of the thorax, which they completely fill. Each lung is of a conical figure, and rests upon the diaphragm, whilst its summit extends a little above the first rib. The external surface of the lung, smooth and convex in its general outline, corresponds with the arch of the ribs ; the internal is compressed, and rests against the medias- tinum, and at its middle third, the bronchi and vessels enter its substance, forming, by their aggregate, what is called the root of the lung. The anterior border is thin and sharp, whilst the posterior is rounded and prominent, being received into the groove formed between the verte- bral column and the ribs. The base, surrounded by a sharp border, is concave, and rests on the arch of the diaphragm, whilst the summit forms a slightly elongated prominence, where it ascends between the scaleni muscles. Each lung is divided into lobes, by a deep fissure, whose direction is from above downwards, and trom behind for- wards ; the lower lobe of each is thus quadrilateral in its figure, the upper conical. The perpendicular depth of the left lung is greater than that of the right, as the cor- responding part of the diaphragm does not ascend so high; its inner border is also excavated to receive the pe- ricardium and heart. The right presents three lobes ; the third being intermediate in size and situation between the two others. It appears like an angular piece, detached by a groove from the anterior and inferior part of the upper lobe. 624. Each lung is invested by a serous lamella, derived from the pleura; its interior is lined by a prolongation of mucous membrane, and the intervening structures form, by their aggregate, what is called the parenchyma of the organ.

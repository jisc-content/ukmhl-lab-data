THE ASTRAGALUS. 79 posterior surface, convex, presents, inferiorly, inequalities for the attachment of the tendo Achillis; and, superiorly, a smooth surface, separated from that tendon by a synovial bursa. The external surface, broader behind than before, presents, in the latter direction, grooves for the tendons of the peronei muscles, and is subcutaneous in the rest of its extent. The inner surface, deeply concave, is traversed by the plantar vessels, nerves, and the tendons of the flexor muscles, and tibialis posticus. The Astragalusi 53. The astragalus is situated at the superior part of the tarsus; its form is irregular; it appears as if twisted on itself. The upper surface presents, in front, a rough and slightly excavated part, serving for the attachment of liga- ments ; and behind it a large convex cartilaginous surface, which is longer and more prominent on the outer than on the inner side, broader before than behind, and articulated with the lower extremity of the tibia. On the inferior sur- face are observed, in front and somewhat internally, a nar- row convex surface, and behind, a broad concave one, both articulating with the os calcis; these are separated by a groove, which receives the ligament that proceeds upwards from the last named bone. The anterior surface, convex, articulates with the naviculare. The posterior surface is grooved and traversed by the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. On the outer and inner sides are situated two sur- faces, (the former the larger,) which are in contact with the inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula, forming the mal- leoli. The astragalus articulates with the tibia and fibula above, with the os calcis below, and with the naviculare in front. The Cuboid Bone. 54. This bone is situated at the external side of the tar- sus ; its form is indicated by its name. The superior sur-

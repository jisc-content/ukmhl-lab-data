elements OF ANATOMY. 84- b. When arranged in the tubular form, and disposed around the internal tegument, or mucous membrane, it constitutes the muscular system of organic life, which is removed from the direct influence of the will, its ap- propriate stimulus being such extraneous substances as are introduced for the purpose of nutrition. In the alimentary canal we find this mode of arrangement of the muscular fibre exemplified. c. The two preceding forms being placed, one beneath the external, the other the internal tegument, there is a third situated between these, and distinguished from them by being stimulated to action only by a fluid (the blood) which is endowed with properties so nearly analogous to those of the living solids, that Mr. Hun- ter, and some other physiologists, have asserted its vitality. The heart alone furnishes an example. 8. The nervous fibre, or the third constituent, maintains an intimate relation with the others, and produces, or at all events conveys to the muscles, their immediate excitant, which has been termed nervous fluid, ner- vous influence, &c. In one mode of arrangement, it forms chords (nerves) ramified through the texture of organs; in another it is disposed in masses, (cere- brum, cerebellum, and medulla) with which the nerves are connected; so that the latter serve the purpose of chordce internuncice, between the different organs of the body and the common centre of nervous in- fluence. 9A. The anatomical constituents, or elements, here enu- merated, variously modified and combined, are found to enter into the composition of certain parts, each of which is marked by a particular conformation, and intended for a special purpose; these are termed organs. The word organ (organon, instrumentum) is used by anatomists to express the material instrument by which an action is executed, or

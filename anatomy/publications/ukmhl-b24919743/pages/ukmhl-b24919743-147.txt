123 THE OS HYOIDES. sis, the genio-hyo-glossi; to the inferior ones, the genio-hy- oi'dei; to the depression beneath these, the digastricus; to the internal oblique line, the mylo-hyoideus, and a small part of the superior constrictor of the pharynx posteriorly. To the external surface of the ramus, the masseter; to the lower part of the inner surface, the pterygoideus internus; to the neck of the condyle, the pterygoideus externus. The Os Hyoides. 88. So called from some resemblance to the Greek let- ter v; it is sitqated at the base of the tongue, and may be felt between the chin and thyroid cartilage. It consists of a body, two cornua and two cornicula. The anterior surface of the body is convex, and marked at the middle by a vertical line, on each side of which are depressions for the attachment of muscles ; its posterior surface is concave, and corresponds with the epiglottis. The cornua project backwards and end in a rounded point. The cornicula, short, and irregularly conical, are placed at the junction of the body with the cornua, and give attachment to the stylo- hyoidean ligament; they continue for a long time moveable, as the cartilage which connects them remains unossified to an advanced period of life. Attachments of Muscles and Ligaments. The stylo-hyoâ€™idean ligaments, to the cornicula ; the thyro-hoidean, to the cornua; the thyro-hoidean membrane, to its lower border. The ante- rior surface gives attachment to the stylo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and digastric muscles; the superior border, to the genioglossi, genio-hyo'id, and middle constrictor of the pharynx; its lower border, to the omo-hyoid and thyro-hyoid muscles. The Teeth. 89. In the adult sixteen teeth are implanted into each jaw, each of which is divisible into three parts, viz. a root, which is concealed in the alveolus; a crown, or head, projecting externally; and an intermediate part, or neck, which con- nects them. The root and centre of each are composed

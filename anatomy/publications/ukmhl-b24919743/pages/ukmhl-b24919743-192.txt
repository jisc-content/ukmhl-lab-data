168 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 143. The posterior ligament extends obliquely downwards and inwards, from the extremity of the radius, to the poste- rior surface of the semi-lunar and cuneiform bones; its fibres appear to be prolonged for some way on the carpal bones. One surface is in contact with the synovial mem- brane, the other with the extensor tendons. 144. The synovial membrane, after having lined the arti- cular surface of the radius, and the triangular fibro-cartilage, is reflected on the anterior and posterior ligaments, and thence over the surface of the carpal bones. The Articulations of the Carpus. The bones of the carpus consist of two sets, each united by its proper connexions, so as to form a row, both how- ever being connected by fibrous bands and a synovial mem- brane common to them. The connexions proper to the first row are interosseous fibro-cartilages, and ligaments placed on their dorsal and palmar surfaces. 145. The interosseous fibro-cartilages are two lamellae, one placed at each side of the semi-lunar bone, connecting it with the scaphoid and cuneiform bones. The carpal extre- mity of these is smooth and lined by the synovial membrane of the wrist joint. 146. The palmar ligaments are two, one extending from the scaphoid bone to the semi-lunar, the other from 4he semi-lunar to the cuneiform, their direction being trans- verse ; and as fheir fibres are partly united, they may be considered as a continuous band connecting these bones. 147. The dorsal ligaments are also two, disposed similarly and connecting the same bones on their posterior surfaces. The pisiform bone stands out of the range, and rests on the palmar surface of the cuneiform, with which it is articu- lated by an irregular fibrous capsule and a synovial mem- brane. The carpal bones of the second range are also connected by similar means. There are three dorsal and palmar li-

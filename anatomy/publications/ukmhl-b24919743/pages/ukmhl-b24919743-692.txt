646 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. structure and functions analogous to the regular or sym- metrical nerves. It consists of two parts, derived from distinct origins; one communicating sensation, the other the power of motion; and the former, like the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, forms a ganglion, whilst the other passes beneath the ganglion, and unconnected with it, but unites with the third division of the nerve, soon after its exit from the skull. The fifth nerve issues from the cerebral substance, about the middle of the crus cere- belli, close to its junction with the pons Varolii: it con- sists of from eighty to a hundred filaments, invested by a neurilema. The filaments at the circumference receive their neurilema sooner than those of the centre, so that if the-nerve be torn off, a sort of mammillary process remains, which seems as if it had been concealed in the interior of the nerve. The filaments of the nerve are divisible into two fasciculi, the anterior and smaller of which can be traced through the pons Varolii as far as the medullary fibres, which are prolonged from the corpus pyramidale upwards; hence this is a motor nerve, as being derived from the tractus motorius; the other, or larger root, in- clines obliquely downwards and backwards through the pons, and is derived from the corpus restiforme, whence it partakes of the properties of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The nerve thus constituted passes for- wards, and on the summit of the pars petrosa pierces the dura mater, and enters a canal formed for it in that mem- brane. The fibres derived from the posterior root expand into a gangliform plexus (Gasserian ganglion.) This is spread out so as to resemble a crescent, and from its an- terior or convex border three branches are given off, one of which passes into the orbit, another passes forwards beneath the orbit to the face, and the third descends through the foramen ovale, to be distributed to the tongue, to the teeth, and muscles of the lower jaw. The two former communicate sensibility only to the

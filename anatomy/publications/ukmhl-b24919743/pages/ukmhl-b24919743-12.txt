It is on this principle that the author has subjoined to the description of the different arterial trunks the most approved method of ex- posing them in different parts of their course, so as to place ligatures upon them. With this view he has also given detailed descriptions of the mode of conducting the examination of those regions of the bod}7 which are occasionally the seat of capital operations.

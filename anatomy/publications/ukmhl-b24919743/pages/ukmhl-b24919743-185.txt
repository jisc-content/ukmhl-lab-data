161 THE SHOULDER JOINT. the coracoid process, and by the narrower to the acromion, between which it is stretched almost horizontally. Its in- ferior surface looks downwards upon the shoulder joint, the superior is covered by the deltoid muscle. Of the Shoulder Joint. 124. The globular head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula, are the osseous parts which compose this articulation (scapulo-humeral). As the head of the humerus is large and prominent, whilst the cavity is merely a superficial depression, it must be evident that they are retained in their situation not by any mechanical contri- vance, but by the capsular ligament, and the muscles which are attached to the two tuberosities of the humerus. 125. The capsular ligament is attached superiorly round the margin of the glenoid cavity, and inferiorly round the neck of the humerus. It is broader in the latter than in the former situation, and its laxity is such, that if the muscular connexions of the humerus be detached, it drops away from the glenoid cavity. The superior and inner part of this membrane is covered and strengthened by a bundle of fibres passing outwards and forwards from the coracoid process to the great tuberosity of the humerus (coraco-hu- meral ligament). Besides this it receives additions from the tendons of the supra and infra spinatus muscles, from the teres minor and subscapularis, wrhich are intimately con- nected with it, as they proceed to be attached to the tube- rosities. Thus its superior part is thick and firm, the infe- rior comparatively thin and weak. Its internal surface is in apposition with the synovial membrane; the external, besides the muscles already mentioned, is covered by the deltoid; inferiorly, it is in relation with the long head of the triceps and the circumflex vessels. The insertion of its inferior border is interrupted to give passage to the long tendon of the biceps muscle. 126. The glenoid ligament appears to be continuous with M

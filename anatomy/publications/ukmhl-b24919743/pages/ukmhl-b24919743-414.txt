ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 376 necessarily vary according to the different positions of the scapula and humerus. Towards their insertion its fibres descend somewhat, whilst those of the latissimus ascend, so that its border is placed lower down than that of the latter muscle. Structure—tendinous at its insertion, fleshy in the rest of its extent: relations—its posterior surface is covered by the latissimus dorsi and integument, and crossed by the long head of the triceps; the anterior, in part of its extent, is in contact with the latissimus, (in consequence of the change of direction of the latter) and slightly with the co- raco-brachialis and brachial vessels. 380. The sub-scapularis fills up the hollow of the sca- pula, lying between that bone and the thorax, from which however it is separated by the serratus magnus muscle. It arises from the entire surface of the sub-scapular fossa, its fibres being divided into two or three bundles by aponeu- roses connected with the prominent lines marked on the bone. From this extensive origin the fibres converge to a thick tendon, which, after being intimately united with the capsular ligament, is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus: direction—from behind forwards, the supe- rior fibres being nearly horizontal, the inferior ascending obliquely: structure—tendinous at its humeral extremity, fleshy in the rest of its extent: relations—by the outer, or posterior surface, with the scapula, and the fibrous capsule of the shoulder, to which it is intimately adherent, by the inner, or anterior surface, with some loose cellular tissue separating it from the serratus magnus, and the brachial plexus of nerves, Actions.—The deltoid can raise the arm directly from the side, so as to bring it at right angles with the body; after which, by means of its anterior and posterior fibres, it can carry the limb alternately backwards and forwards, being assisted in the former movement by the teres major and latissimus dorsi, in the latter by the pectoralis major. The mass of its muscular fibres is so con- siderable that it is enabled, by pressing down the head of the hu-

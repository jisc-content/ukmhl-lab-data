190 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. third has one from the third bone of that name; and finally, the two last are bound by a broad fasciculus to the cuboid bone. The plantar set is similarly disposed, the first and second are more strongly marked than the corre- sponding ligaments on the dorsal surface. 199. The anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones are connected with those of the phalanges, by two lateral ligaments, an inferior ligament, and a synovial membrane, similar in every respect to those of the hand. The articu- lations of the phalanges with one another are also con- structed on the same principle as those of the superior extremity. 200. The structures here described enter into the imme- diate composition of joints ; the bursae mucosae which sur- round them may be considered as accessories, as they are placed between parts exposed to much friction, and in- tended for the same purposes as the synovial membranes, viz. to secrete a fluid, which lubricates contiguous surfaces : their structure and anatomical arrangement are quite simi- lar, both being shut sacs. Bursae vary considerably in size as well as in form, some being oval or circular, others elongated, so as to form sheaths which enclose tendons. Thus, where tendons are retained in situ by fibrous sheaths, the contiguous surfaces are invested by a bursal membrane reflected over them, ex. gr. the different flexor and exten- sor tendons in both extremities; also, where a muscle has to slide over a bony prominence, as where the gluteus maximus passes over the great trochanter, a bursa is inter- posed; or where processes of bone play on fibrous struc- tures, as between the acromion and the capsule of the shoulder joint. These instances will suffice to point out the operation of the general principle which determines the formation of synovial or mucous bursas.

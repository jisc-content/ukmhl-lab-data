THE KNEE JOINT. 177 The Knee Joint. 173. This is a ginglimus, or hinge joint, formed by the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front, the contiguous surfaces of each being tipped with cartilage, and invested by a common sy- novial membrane. The following ligaments enter into the composition of the articulation: the ligamentum patellae, the external and internal lateral, a posterior, a transverse, and two crucial ligaments; besides these may be enume- rated two semi-lunar fibro-cartilages, and some folds of the synovial membrane, which have received names, viz. the ligamenta alaria and mucosum, but the term ligament can- not with propriety be applied to any other than fibrous structures which connect parts together. 174. The ligamentum patellce is a flat strong band of tendinous fibres, which connects the patella with the ante- rior tuberosity of the tibia. Its superior extremity is at- tached to the apex of the patella, and to a depression on its posterior surface ; its superficial fibres pass upwards on the anterior aspect of the bone, and become continuous with those of the tendon of the rectus femoris, the inferior extremity is a little expanded; towards the middle its bor- ders are slightly tucked in. The anterior surface of this li- gament is subcutaneous in its whole extent; the posterior rests on the synovial membrane, from which it is separated by some adipose substance, as it is inferiorly from the head of the tibia by a synovial bursa. 175. The internal lateral ligament, broad and flat, con- nects the tuberosity of the internal condyle of the femur with the inner surface of the head of the tibia. It becomes broad inferiorly, where it is covered by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus muscles; internally it rests on the synovial membrane, and is attached to the internal semi-lunar cartilage. 176. The external lateral ligament is a rounded cord- N

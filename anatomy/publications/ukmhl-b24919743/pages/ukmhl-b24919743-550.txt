508 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. vision of the rectum into three parts, differing in situation and relation to contiguous parts. That part of the intes- tine included between the sigmoid flexure and the first turn, which is about half its length, is covered by peri- tonaeum in front and at the sides, and also connected by it, though loosely, to the sacrum. The middle portion, or that between the curves, is about three inches long, its di- rection being forwards and a little downwards; it rests on the lower part of the sacrum, the coccyx, and the coccigei muscles, whilst its upper surface lies immediately beneath the base of the bladder, and the prostate gland being se- parated from the former on either side by the vesiculae se- minales, and between them merely by some loose cellular tissue. This part is stripped altogether of the peritonaeal coat, which is reflected off it, where it arrives opposite the points at which the ureters impinge on the base of the bladder. The lower portion, is about an inch, or an inch and a half in length, its direction being downwards and a little backwards from opposite the prostate to the anus. The longitudinal fibres of the intestine cease about three or four lines from the margin of the anus, but the circular ones be- come considerably increased, forming a thick ring surround- ing the gut, so as to merit the name of a sphincter (sphinc- ter internus). Structure.â€”The large intestine is composed of three tunics, like the rest of the canal. The serous coat invests the ascending and descending portions of the colon only at the front and sides, as the posterior and inner border corresponds with the interval be- tween the lamellae of the meso-cola; and, as its transverse arch gives attachment to the great omentum and the transverse meso- colon ; it is uncovered along these points. The external surface of the coecum and colon is marked by three narrow lines running their entire length, composed of the external or longitudinal fibres of the muscular coat clustered together, and which, by being somewhat shorter than the intestine, draw it into folds or sacculi, commencing at the coecum, and extending to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, the rectum not being marked by any such

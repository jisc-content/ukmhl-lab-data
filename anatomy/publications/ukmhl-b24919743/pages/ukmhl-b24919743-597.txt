553 PERIN.EUM— PUDIC NERVE. the spine of that bone, it terminates either in the sciatic, gluteal, or obturator vein. 615. A vein of considerable size runs on the dorsum of the penis {vena dorsalis penis). It commences by small branches, which, at the corona glandis, communicate with its capillary arteries, and proceeding backwards, receives branches of anastomosis from the pudic vein, and also from the interior of the corpus cavernosum. On reaching the root of the penis, it passes beneath the pubic sym- physis, and terminates in a venous plexus placed at the neck of the bladder, through the medium of which its blood is finally conveyed into the internal iliac vein. The dorsal vein is sometimes found a single vessel, at others, double, or even triple. 616. The pudic nerve is a branoh of the sacral plexus, from which it inclines downwards and outwards, so as to come into contact with the artery of the same name, as it is escaping from the pelvis, in the interval between the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles. Its course and distri- bution are similar in every respect to that of the artery. Thus it sends one or two hasmorrhoidal branches to the extremity of the rectum, also twigs to the obturator muscle, and a long branch which accompanies the super- ficial perinasal artery, and has a similar mode of distribu- tion. The continuation of the nerve reaches the dorsum of the penis, by passing between the corpus cavernosum and the pubic symphysis; after which it passes forwards beneath the skin as far as the glans, where its filaments cease to be discernible. In the female the superficial perinaeal nerve is larger than the deep-seated one just described, because it is distributed to the labium, whilst the other supplies the clitoris. Dissection.—We shall examine the perinaeum as a surgical region, and review the different parts it contains in reference to the operation of lithotomy, or more properly cystotomy (/cuime, a

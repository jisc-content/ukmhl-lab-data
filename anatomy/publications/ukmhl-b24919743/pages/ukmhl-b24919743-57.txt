PRIMARY TISSUES. 33 skeleton) receives into its meshes a deposit of osseous matter, and so forms the basis of the osseous system, which gives support to all the other parts of the body, f. By another mode of aggregation the cellular tissue is formed into fibres, which by being coiled into tubes, constitute the different sorts of vessels named arteries, veins, and absorbents. It should, however, be observed, that this position rests solely on the fact, that fibrine, the essential constituent of muscle, cannot be proved by chemical analysis to exist in the tunics of any of the ves- sels. Some anatomists contend that arteries are irritable, contractile, and muscular, others that they are merely elastic, their middle coat being composed of a peculiar texture (tissue jaune, tissue elastique) resolvable ulti- mately into cellular tissue. This question shall be considered fully when we treat of the general anatomy of arteries. 2. The muscular fibre, the second general constituent of organized structures, is characterized by irritability and contractility, which may be considered as its dis- tinguishing properties. In warm-blooded animals its colour is red ; in others it is pale, or white; but in all its forms, it is usually denominated the flesh. The fibres are always found collected into fasciculi, and these again into bundles (muscles), the bond of union being cellular tissue, which is interposed between them. These are the active agents in locomotion, and in all the various actions which animals perform. The muscular fibre presents some modifications which deserve notice, referrible not only to its situation and mode of arrangement, but also to the nature of the stimulant it is intended to obey. a. When subjected altogether to the control of the will, and placed beneath the external tegument, it consti- tutes what Bich&t termed the muscular system of animal life, D

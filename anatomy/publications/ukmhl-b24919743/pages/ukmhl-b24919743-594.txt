550 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. them having become tendinous, unite, so as to support it in a sling. 610. The perinseal muscles in the female correspond so nearly with those of the male in their number, general con- formation, and attachments, that it is unnecessary to treat particularly of more than two of them. 611. The erector clitoridis (depressor, Meckel) re- sembles the diminutive of the erector penis ; it arises from the ramus of the pubis, and is inserted into the body of the clitoris. 612. The constrictor vaginae resembles an orbicular muscle, being composed of two narrow fasciculi, united before and behind the vagina by two commissures, and leaving between them an elliptic interval corresponding with its circumference. The two muscles of this name may be said to arise posteriorly at a point common to them, with the sphincter ani and transversi muscles ; and after diverging to enclose the vagina, they unite in front of it into a tendinous process, which connects them to the corpus clitoridis. Actions.â€”The transversi muscles conspire to fix the common point of attachment of the perinaeal muscles, and so increase their power. The action of the sphincter ani is sufficiently obvious. The accelerator muscle, by surrounding the bulbous part of the urethra, and by the increased power it acquires from its many points of attachment, is enabled forcibly to propel any fluid that may be lodged within the canal in that situation. The levator ani, in position and direction, is opposed to the diaphragm, and as the latter forces down the intestines by its descent, the former, as its name implies, can elevate at least the lower part of the intes- tinal canal. The Internal Pudic Artery. 6L3. The parts contained in the perinseum are supplied with blood from the internal pudic artery. This vessel usually arises as a distinct branch from the internal iliac

55 THE VERTEBRA. " it to the effect of muscular action, and explained it in the following way:â€”As most persons are disposed to use the right arm in preference to the left, the muscles of that side Become stronger, and act with more power on the points to which they are attached; when making efforts, as in pulling, the body is curved to the left, which gives an ad- ditional advantage to the muscles; and the habitual use of this position determines some degree of permanent curva- ture. In support of this explanation of the fact, Beclard has stated, that he found in one or two individuals whom he knew to have been left-handed, the convexity of the la- teral curve directed to the left side. The 'posterior surface presents along the median line the spinous processes, disposed in a regular series, varying in form and direction, as has been already stated, being hori- zontal in the cervical and lumbar regions, and nearly verti- cal in the dorsal. On each side of these are the vertebral grooves, extending from the base of the skull to the sacrum, which are filled up with the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, multifidus spinas, &c. The lateral surfaces present the transverse processes, va- rying in form and character in the different regions ; before these are situated the inter-vertebral foramina, and more anteriorly still, in the dorsal region, the articulating surfaces which receive the heads of the ribs. The summit is articulated with the occipital bone, .and supports the head, whilst the base, or broader extremity, rests on the sacrum. Along the entire extent of the co- lumn runs the vertebral canal, which is broad and triangu- lar in the cervical and lumbar regions, circular and con- tracted in the dorsal. Of the Thorax. 37. Into the composition of the thoracic portion of the skeleton, enter the sternum and ribs, which are proper and peculiar to it, and the vertebrae, which are common to it

592 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. older anatomists had conceived sufficiently correct notions of some parts of the circulating system, yet none of them were able to combine these parts together, so as to form a connected whole that, was reserved for Harvey, who, about the year 1619, first de- scribed the true course of the blood in the different orders of vessels, and demonstrated the correctness of his opinions by a complete series of proofs and experiments. The division of the circulation into the greater and the less, or the pulmonary and aortic, as established by Harvey, continued to be universally received, until Bichat (not by any means with a view to question its correctness or truth,) adopted another, on physiological grounds. The blood in the branches and trunks of the venae cavae, in the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery, being of a reddish brown colour (venous), that in the pulmonary veins, in the left side of the heart, and likewise in the aorta and its ramifications, being red (arterial), suggested to the mind of this great physiologist a corresponding division of the circulation into that of the red and that of the dark blood. Accord mg to Harvey, the heart, placed at the commencement of each circle, receives the blood, and propels it forwards, to describe the greater and the lesser course. According to Bichat, the heart must be conceived to be situated mid-way between the origin and termination of each system ; of which one (the dark blooded) begins in the general capillary system of the body, and terminates in the capil- laries of the lungs ; whilst the red blooded commences in the latter vessels, and ends in the capillaries diffused throughout the body. In this view of the subject, the actions of the lungs, and those going on in the body generally, may be considered as maintaining a constant antagonism, the one purifying and restoring the blood which had been deteriorated by the other. The formation and development of the vascular system have been examined of late years with the greatest attention by several physiologists, particularly by Meckel, Serres, and Home, whose researches have thrown considerable light on this rather complex subject. Meckel has directed his inquiries for the most part to the following points: â€” to ascertain the parts of the system which are first developed ; the arrangement of these parts in the earlier stages of foetal life; the relation which exists at different periods

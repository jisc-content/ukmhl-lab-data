56 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. and other parts. The latter have been described in the preceding pages. The Sternum. Situated in the median line, at the fore-part of the thorax, this bone is flat and elongated in its general outline, broad superiorly, contracted in the middle, and terminat- ing in a point. We have to consider successively its sur- faces, extremities, and borders. The anterior surface subjacent to the skin, gives attach- ment to the aponeuroses of the pectoralis major and sterno- mastoid muscles; and is marked by four transverse lines, indicating its original division into five pieces. The posterior surface looks backwards, towards the ca- vity of the thorax, and gives attachment superiorly to the sterno-hyoideus, and sterno-thyro'ideus muscles, inferiorly to the triangularis sterni. Along the middle line it corre- sponds with the interval left by the divergence of the pleurae. The borders are thick, and marked by seven depressions, for the reception of the cartilages of the true ribs, which give them a notched or serrated appearance. The superior extremity, broad and thick, is slightly ex- cavated from side to side, and presents at each corner a depression for the reception of the sternal end of the clavi- cle. The inferior extremity, thin and elongated, gives attach- ment to a cartilaginous appendix, called the ensiform carti- lage, which in most cases remains in the cartilaginous state, until an advanced period of life. It is sometimes bent for- wards, sometimes in the opposite direction, and often pierced by a hole at its centre. Its form varies considerably in dif- ferent individuals; it gives attachment to the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles. The sternum, in early infancy, is divided into several pieces, but in adult age two only re- main distinct. The first division of the sternum is larger and thicker than the other; its form is nearly square; its

631 DURA MATER. The Membranes of the Brain and Medulla Spinalis. 672. The brain and medulla spinalis are invested by three membranous lamellae, namely, the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater. The dura mater, which is the most external of the three, is thick, firm, and resisting-, and belongs to the class of fibrous, or rather fibi’o-serous membranes, as it is in reality a compound structure; the outer lamella being fibrous, the inner serous, and derived from the arachnoid membrane. It is in close apposition with the cranium, which it lines, at the same time that it invests the brain, and sends inwards pro- cesses which are interposed between its different parts, serving to sustain them. It is, moreover, prolonged in a tubular form through the spinal canal, but is separated from the bones by a lamella of adipose tissue, and the rachidian veins. It adheres to the arch of the skull, par- ticularly along the sutures, but at its base the points of connexion are multiplied by its passing over the inequali- ties of the surface, and still more so by sending tubular prolongations through the different foramina, serving to inclose and protect the nerves which they transmit. Along the spinal column similar prolongations pass out with the nerves through the inter-vertebral foramina: these constitute its chief connexion with the bones. But towards the lower part of the sacral canal it is fixed by some irregular fibrous bands. The processes formed by the dura mater are the following :— a. The falx cerebri is lodged in the longitudinal fissure be- tween the hemispheres, forming a partition between them. It is narrow before, broad behind, and presents a curved border infe- riorly, so that in shape it resembles a sickle; whence its name. It extends from the crista galli, which is inserted between its lamellae, to the internal occipital protuberance, on a level with which it be- comes blended with the tentorium cerebelli. It seems as if formed

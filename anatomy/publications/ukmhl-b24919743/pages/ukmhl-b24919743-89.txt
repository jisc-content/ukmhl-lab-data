THE OS PUBIS. 65 The Os Pubis. 44. This bone forms the anterior and internal part of the os innominatum; and is usually divided into two parts, one superior, and thick, called the body, the other infe- rior, and thin,—the ramus. The body, horizontal in its direction, and prismatic in its form, presents three surfaces, separated by three promi- nent lines. The superior surface, slightly depressed, is covered by the pectineus muscle; the internal is smooth, and forms part of the pelvic cavity ; the third inferior, and somewhat grooved transversely, inclines downwards, to the thyroid foramen. The external extremity of the bone is thick, and presents three faces; one, concave, forms part of the acetabulum ; another, superior, connects it with the ileum (the junction being marked by a slight elevation, called the ileo-pectineal eminence')', the third, inferior, is joined with the ischium. The internal extremity, flat and compressed, is joined to the corresponding part of the opposite bone, by an intervening cartilage, the junction being termed the symphysis pubis. Leading outwards from the symphysis, whose direction is vertical, may be observed another margin, nearly an inch in length, which is placed horizontally, and named the crista. The angle formed by the crista and symphysis, is termed the angle of the pubis ; the crista is terminated externally, by a projecting nodule of bone—the tuberosity or spine, from which runs outwards a sharp line, (the ileo-pectineal line) giving attachment to Gimbernat’s ligament, and to the pectineus muscle, and marking the margin of the pelvis. The ramus descends outwards and downwards from the body, forming an angle with it, becomes thin, and unites with the ascending ramus of the ischium. The inner sur- face is smooth, the external is rough, for the attachment of muscles. One of its borders, thick and rough, forms with the opposite bone an arch, called the arch of the pubis; F

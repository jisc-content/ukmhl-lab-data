ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 42 over the growth and development of the osseous system, and by which its different parts are adapted to their ap- propriate purposes. The cavities of transmission give pas- sage to vessels and nerves; their form is various, some being mere fissures, others tubular, &c.; to this head are also referable several of the apertures at the base of the brain. The foramina of nutrition transmit the vessels intend- ed for the support of the substance of the bones, and of the medulla ; they are divisible into three orders. The first usually receive the name of foramina of nutrition, though in strictness it does not belong to them more than to the others; the only difference between them being, that they transmit vessels to supply the medullary mem- brane, whilst the others give passage to those which are distributed to the substance of the bone. The first set, considerably the largest, are situated towards the middle of the long bones, and penetrate their substance in an oblique direction. The second order of foramina are much smaller, but very numerous; they are most perceptible towards the extremities of long bones, and generally all over the sur- face of the short and thick ones. But the third are so minute as to be perceptible only by the aid of a glass, by which we can discern them all over the surface. 29. The proper structure of bone is fibrous in its cha- racter, in some parts the fibres being closely aggregated together, constitute a firm and compact substance; in others they are separate, so as to enclose spaces or cells^ on which depends the porous and spongy appearance of some bones. The compact substance is so close in its texture, that the naked eye can discover no interstices in it, yet by the aid of a microscope, a great number of minute vascular canals become perceptible. In the long bones, these canals are all longitudinal, and maintain a free communication laterally

295 THE PLANTAR NERVES. passes down with the vein behind the external ankle, so as to reach the dorsum of the foot, where it divides into two branches, one running on the fourth, the other on the fifth metatarsal bone, and distributing filaments as far as the corresponding digital phalanges. The branch here de- scribed lies beneath the fascia in its coui'se down the leg, but at different intervals sends through it filaments which ramify in the integuments, some of them descending as far as the interval between the ankles, b. Several muscular branches proceed from the nerve to the heads of the gas- trocnemius, the plantaris, popliteus, and soleus muscles; and in the lower part of its course it supplies also the tibialis posticus, and the long flexors, its filaments diverging and uniting again so as in some places to form a mesh round the posterior tibial artery. 316. When arrived at the hollow of the calcaneum, and lying under cover of the abductor pollicis muscle, the pos- terior tibial nerve divides into the internal and external plantar branches. 1. The internal plantar branch, the lar- ger of the two, passes directly forwards beneath the tarsal bones, concealed by the abductor pollicis muscle, to which, as well as to the flexor accessorius, and flexor brevis, it gives branches. It soon divides into, or gives off four branches, intended to supply both sides of the great toe, and of the two next to it, as well as the inner side of the fourth, a. The first ramusculus is smaller than any of the others; it proceeds forwards and inwards beneath the flexor brevis pollicis, to reach the inner side of the great toe, forming its first collateral branch: b, the second, as it passes forwards, corresponds with the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones, where it gives filaments to the flexor brevis and the first lumbricalis, and on reach- ing the fissure between the toes, divides into two off-sets, which run along the contiguous borders of the first and se- cond toes: c, the third, lies in the second metatarsal space, supplies the first plantar interosseous muscle, and, like the

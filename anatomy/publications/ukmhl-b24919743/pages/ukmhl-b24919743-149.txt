THE TEETH. 125 ancl constitutes as it were the model on which it is to be moulded. The osseous matter begins to be deposited first on its free surface, in a thin lamella, corresponding with the crown of the tooth ; or rather in dots or scales correspond- ing with each of the inequalities on its upper surface, and gradually uniting to form a lamella. When the breadth is completed, the growth in length begins, and extends from the crown to the roots by successive depositions on the ex- terior of the pulp; so that if may be said to clothe itself in osseous matter, the roots being the parts last formed, the crown first. The bony lamella is at first remarkably thin, and the contained cavity of considerable size; but as the former increases in thickness by successive depositions on its inner surface, the latter and its inclosed pulp, become proportionally diminished, until the roots and body of the tooth have acquired their proper degree of thickness. The enamel also is first deposited on the free surface of the tooth, being secreted by the external membrane, which is reflected over the sacculus in the first instance, and after- wards over the crown of the tooth when ossification has been established. It is at first soft, semi-fluid, and easily se- parable from the bone, as in after-life it may be separated by the application of heat. When the ossification has reached the root, the tooth can no longer be confined within the al- veolus; it forces its way through the portion of the reflected membrane corresponding with its crown ; then through a dense substance placed along the alveolar border of the jaw, and which is seen to elevate the mucous membrane in the form of a ridge; finally it pierces the latter, and makes its appearance within the cavity of the mouth. Thus the prin- ciple of eccentric development obtains throughout the en- tire process of the growth of the teeth, the particles of mat- ter being first deposited at the points most remote from the centre: still it is not strictly analogous with what builders term over-hand work, for it not only proceeds from without to within, but begins at the top, and thence descends to the

72 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. great trochanter, may be observed an oblique and promi- nent line, directed downwards and inwards, and terminat- ing in an eminence of much less size, called the trochanter minor. The trochanter minor, a conical rounded eminence, pro- jects from the posterior and internal side of the shaft of the bone, and gives attachment to the tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles. At the inner side of the great trochanter, and above the lesser, projects upwards, inwards, and a little forwards, an elongated process, forming the neck of the bone, which terminates in a rounded globular head. The line of direc- tion of the neck forms an obtuse angle with the axis of the femur; its anterior surface is broad and smooth, the supe- rior, inclined upwards, is somewhat concave; the inferior is the most extensive. The union of the neck witli the rest of the bone, is marked by two oblique lines, one anterior, the other posterior, proceeding from the trochanter major; to these is attached the capsular ligament. The neck is surmounted by a globular head, which forms a considerable segment of a sphere, is tipped with cartilage in the fresh state, and lodged in the acetabulum. A little beneath its most prominent point is a small cavity, which gives attach- ment to the round ligament. The inferior extremity of the bone, much thicker and broader than the superior, is terminated by two eminences, separated posteriorly by a deep fossa; these are named condyles, of which one is internal, the other external. The external is larger, and projects forwards more than the internal; its articulating surface also is broader and mounts higher up; the external surface, rough and unequal, presents a deep pit inferiorly, which gives attachment to the tendon of the popliteus muscle. The articular surfaces of both, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, are united anteriorly, where they form a pulley-like surface, concave from side to side, on which the

CEREBRAL PROTUBERANCE. 623 The Cerebral Protuberance. 667. The cerebral protuberance is much the smallest portion of the central mass ; its relative size being to that of the rest as 1 : 60. It is placed between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, having intimate rela- tions with each by continuity of substance; hence it has been termed nodus encephali. It is a square mass, its depth being about equal to its length. Its anterior sur- face is convex, and rests against the basilar process of the occipital bone, and is composed of the converging fibres of the cerebellum, disposed so as to form a portion of a ring, which incloses the contiguous extremities of the crura cerebri and medulla oblongata, on which account it has been termed protuberantia annularis, or pons Varolii. Its upper border is bounded by a transverse line, marking its separation from-the crura cerebri, and the lower by another line, which divides it from the medulla oblongata ; along its middle is a shallow groove running from above downwards, which corresponds with the basilar artery. The posterior surface is almost entirely concealed by the cerebellum ; it is surmounted by four rounded bodies (tubercula quadrigemina), disposed in pairs, one above the other, and separated by two decussating lines. The upper pair are the larger, and called nates—the lower, testes: they are connected in front with the thalami, infe- riorly with the processus ad testes, and the valve of Vieus- seus, and between their upper surface and the corpus collosum is a rima or fissure (fissure of Bichat), through which the arachnoid membrane enters to line the ven- tricles. The irregular vacuities disposed in the interior of the cerebel- lum and brain communicate freely with one another by certain constricted portions, or foramina. If, whilst the brain and cere- bellum remain “ in situ,” the latter be divided by a vertical inci-

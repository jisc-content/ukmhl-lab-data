191 CHAPTER IV. Section I. MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN AND LOWER EXTREMITY. 201. We commence the description of the muscles with those which enter into the composition of the parietes of the abdomen. We may observe in limine, that whilst treating of this department of our subject, we shall group the muscles into sets according as they are associated or combined in their more important actions. The abdominal muscles consist of three broad lamellae on each side, a pair (usually two pair) in front, flat, elongated, and inclosed within the aponeurotic expansions of the former ; and an- other pair situated posteriorly, beside the vertebral column, which are contained within a similar expansion prolonged from the lateral muscles to the lumbar vertebrae. 202. The obliquus* externus abdominis (obliquus descen- dens; costo- abdominal, Chaussier ; ilio-pubi-costo-abdo- minal, Dumas) is situated on the lateral and anterior parts of the abdomen; its form being broad, thin, and irregu- larly quadrilateral. It arises from the anterior surfaces of the eight inferior ribs, by fleshy fibres arranged in so many digitations, of which five meet an equal number of similar prolongations from the serratus magnus muscle, and three with those of the latissimus dorsi. The fleshy fibres from the last ribs pass down to be inserted into the external margin of the crista ilei for half its length; * The nomenclature of Soemmering has been generally adhered to throughout this part of the work, as being that adopted by the most experienced teachers. Chaussierâ€™s terms are added, to facilitate the perusal of French anatomical and surgical works, and those of Dumas merely because they express briefly all the points to which each muscle is attached.

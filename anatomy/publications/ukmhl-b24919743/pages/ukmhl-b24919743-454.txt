414 ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. Section IV. THE LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITIES. 430. These vessels are divisible into two sets, one being superficial, the other deep-seated. The deep lymphatics follow the course of the radial, ulnar, and interosseous ar- teries, and of their respective branches, so that it is quite unnecessary to give any thing like a detailed description of them; they all terminate in the glands of the axilla, or by joining the superficial lymphatics. 431. The superficial lymphatics commence by two divi- sions. Of these one corresponds with the branches of the ulnar cutaneous vein, which its different ramusculi accom- pany from the inner border of the hand, along the fore-arm, as far as the bend of the elbow. In this course they re- ceive numerous branches from the surrounding parts, and join at the point just indicated, with the external or poste- rior lymphatic vessels. The division last named, consists of the lymphatic branches which are placed along the pos- terior and external border of the fore-arm, following the course of the radial cutaneous veins. They ascend towards the bend of the elbow, and unite with the other set, so as to form two or three trunks, which pass along with the brachial artery, and open into the axillary glands, having previously communicated with, or received the deep lym- phatics. 432. From the glands in the axilla, vessels, fewer in number, but larger in size, issue and proceed along with the subclavian artery, in some parts twining round it. From the top of the thorax they ascend into the neck, close to the subclavian vein, and having joined with the lymphatics of the head and trunk, terminate at the angle of union formed by tbe subclavian and internal jugular veins.

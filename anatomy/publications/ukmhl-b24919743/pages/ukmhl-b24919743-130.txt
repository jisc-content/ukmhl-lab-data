ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 106 levelled off at its margin, is overlapped by the squamous portion of the temporal bone : the anterior unites with the frontal bone, and the posterior with the occipital. The an- terior inferior angle dips down to the sphenoid, and is marked internally by the meningeal artery: the posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid part of the tem- poral bone, and presents internally a part of the groove which lodges the lateral sinus. It gives attachment to the temporal muscle by that part of its surface which lies beneath the temporal ridge. The Frontal Bone. 76. Situated at the anterior part of the skull, and superior part of the face, this bone is divisible into two parts (frontal and orbitar) differing in size and position; of these one is turned upwards and forwards, forms three fourths of its ex- tent, the other inferior, and horizontal in its direction, forms the roof of the orbits. The external surface of the frontal part presents on each side a slight elevation, named frontal eminence: beneath this an arched depression, bounded be- low by the superciliary ridge, which surmounts the mar- gin of the orbit, and towards the inner third of the latter is a small foramen, or sometimes a notch covered in by a ligament, which transmits the frontal nerve and artery. Between the superciliary arches is the nasal eminence, or glabella, which is prominent in proportion to the size of the frontal sinuses, and bounded inferiorly by a rough surface, articulating with the nasal bones, and the ascending pro- cesses of the superior maxilla. From this surface projects the nasal spine, to articulate in front with the nasal bones, and behind with the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid. The internal surface of the bone is concave, and presents along the median line a groove, corresponding with the lon- gitudinal sinus, and a ridge for the attachment of the falx; this ridge terminates in a minute foramen called foramen

620 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY, cavity (third ventricle), which corresponds exactly with the middle line, and resembles a longitudinal fissure. Its sides are formed by the thalami, its floor by the locus perforatus and tuber cinereum; the velum interpositum and formix cover it in. The anterior commissure, and the pillars of the fornix, bound it in front. Into this cavity leads an aperture (foramen commune anterius; foramen Monroi), which is a rima between the anterior pillars of the fornix and the thalami, and which establishes a communication be- tween the third and the lateral ventricles ; a foramen leads out of it downwards and forwards, (iter ad infundibulum). It may be observed that the infundibulum becomes im- perforate at its middle, which appears to be owing to a small 'cul-de-sac of arachnoid membrane, which is pro- longed into it. From the posterior extremity of the ven- tricle another foramen opens into a canal (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum; aquceductus Sylvii), which leads obliquely downwards and backwards into the fourth ven- tricle. Two cord-like fasciculi are stretched across the ex- tremities of the third ventricles, and prolonged into the hemispheres which they connect, serving as commissures. The anterior commissure lies just before the pillars of the fornix, and as it extends laterally it will be found embedded in the substance of the corpora striata on each side, but does not become blended with them ; its extremi- ties arch backwards a considerable way, so as to form a curve, whose convexity looks forwards. The posterior commissure is much shorter than the preceding, and ex- tends but a few lines pn each side into the thalami: it lies above the aqueduct of Sylvius, and before the tuber- cula quadrigemina.

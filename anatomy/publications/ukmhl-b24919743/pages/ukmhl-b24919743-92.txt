68 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. pubis. It is surrounded in the greater part of its extent by a margin or supercilium, which is most prominent to- wards the superior and external part, but at the opposite point, or towards the thyroid foramen it is deficient, leaving a notch. The gi’eater part of the cavity is covered with cartilage in the natural condition; but towards the notch there is a part depressed beneath the rest, and which cor- responds with the passage of the round ligament, and lodges some synovial cryptas; this has no cartilaginous coating. General Conformation of the Pelvis. 46. The pelvis, thus made up of the ossa innominata, the sacrum, and coccyx, deserves to be attentively ex- amined, not merely as to the details of the parts which compose it, but as to its general conformation. Taking the objects which are deserving of notice, from before, backwards, and beginning, at the median line, we observe the symphysis pubis, or the line of junction between the two bones of that name—on the sides, the thyroid fora- mina and the acetabula. Posteriorly, along the middle line, are situated the tubercles or spinous processes of the sacrum ; external to these, the posterior sacral foramina, and next, a broad, unequal surface, to which the sciatic li- gaments and gluteus maximus are attached ; and lastly, the deep excavation, (sacro-sciatic notch) bounded by the contiguous margins of the sacrum and os innominatum. The internal surface is divided into two parts by a pro- minent line, (linea ileo-pectinea) leading from the tuberosi- ties of the ossa pubis, outwards and backwards, to the pro- minent point of the sacrum (promontorium). This con- stitutes the margin of the true pelvis, all the part above it being called the false pelvis, as in reality it belongs to the abdomen. The superior circumference of the pelvis is formed on

SCALENI. 441 base of the tongue forwards, so as to make its apex protrude beyond the mouth. The anterior fibres will, subsequently, act in retracting the tongue within the mouth. The mylo-hyoidei may be compared to a moveable floor or bed, which closes in the inferior and anterior part of the mouth, at the same time serving to sustain the body of the tongue. The linguales resemble re- tractor muscles ; they shorten the tongue, and draw its apex downwards, so as to make its dorsum convex. Six muscles lie deeply at the side and front of the ver- tebral column. 465. The scalenus anticus lies deeply at the side of the neck, behind and beneath the sterno-mastoid. It arises by a flat, narrow tendon, from the anterior surface of the first rib, from which its fleshy fibres ascend vertically, to be inserted into the anterior tubercles of four cervical ver- tebras, from the third to the sixth inclusive. The lower part of the muscle separates the subclavian artery and vein. It is over-lapped by the sterno-mastoid muscle, (a small part only projecting behind its outer border,) and crossed by the omo-hyoideus, with which and the clavicle it bounds an angular interval, in the area of which lie the subclavian artery and commencement of the axillary plexus. 466. The scalenus posticus is larger and longer than the preceding muscle, from which it is separated below, by the subclavian artery, and above, by the cervical nerves, as they issue from the inter-vertebral foramina. It arises from the first rib, about an inch behind the other muscle of the same name, and also from the second near its tu- bercle. The fleshy fibres ascend along the side of the vertebral column, and are inserted, by so many tendinous processes, into the posterior tubercles of all the cervical vertebrae except the first. The two origins of the scalenus posticus are separated at first by a cellular interval, which has given occasion to the division of the muscle into two

The nervous system, in its development, obeys the same law; the nerves on the sides of the head, trunk, and pelvis, are formed independently of the brain and spinal marrow, and their cords and filaments may be distinctly traced, before even a rudiment of the cerebro-spinal masses is perceptible,* so that the nerves may be said to begin where they have been hitherto thought to terminate, and vice versa. The medulla spinalis, when just distinguishable, consists of two lamellae, or bands, separated by a slight in- terval ; these soon unite in front, so as to form a groove, and finally at the opposite point, constituting a cylindrical tube, which is gradually filled up by a series of lamellae de- posited one within the other, until it is converted into a so- lid mass of a cylindrical form. The lateral masses of the brain when first deposited, are quite distinct from one ano- ther, but as the process of growth extends towards the central line, the corpus callosum, and the other commis- sures, are produced, which establish a medium of connex- ion between them, and when the union is completed, its line of direction is indicated by the raphe, perceptible along the upper surface of the corpus callosum, and which is found to extend quite through its substance. These facts claim, in an especial manner, the anatomistâ€™s attention; they point out the marked line of distinction which exists between organized and unorganized bodies. The latter are universally admitted to be produced in the first instance by an aggregation of particles of matter, regulated by the laws of chemical attraction, and subsequently increased by a de- position of similar particles round the central nucleus; the development of the latter proceeds in a course precisely the reverse of this ; beginning at the circumference, it gra- dually extends to the centre, and so must evidently be re- gulated by laws differing altogether (may we not say essen-

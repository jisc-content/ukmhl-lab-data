94 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. rolls on the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; the latter is smooth and convex; the former, also smooth, is a shallow cup-like cavity. The inferior extremity of the radius, much larger than the superior, is nearly quadrilateral in its form ; anteriorly it gives attachment by a prominent ridge to the anterior li- gament of the wrist joint; posteriorly may be observed grooves which transmit the tendons of the extensor mus- cles ; of these, one narrow and oblique in its direction, and nearly in the middle line, lodges the tendon of the extensor pollicis (secundi internodii). Another at the ulnar side of this, much broader, transmits the tendons of the extensor communis and indicator, whilst a third to its radial side, and divided into two parts by a linear impression, marks the passage of the flexor carpi radialis, longior and brevior. Corresponding with the external border of the bone, is another groove, directed obliquely forwards and divided into two parts, for the tendons of the extensores primi in- ternodii, and ossis metacarpi pollicis. The border by which the two latter grooves are separated, is prolonged down- wards, and named the styloid process; it affords attach- ment to the external lateral ligament of the wrist joint. On the inner side of the bone is situated a small oval cavity, covered by cartilage, which articulates with the inferior ex- tremity of the ulna. Inferiorly, the radius terminates in an articular surface, divided from before backwards, by a line, into two unequal portions, of which the external triangular articulates with the os scaphoides, the internal is square, and articulates with the os lunare.

The anterior surface, by its superior three-fourths, to the flexor longus pollicis; by the oblique line, leading from the tuberosity to the insertion of the pro- nator radii teres, to the supinator brevis and flexor sublimis; its inferior fourth to the pronator quadratus ; the posterior surface, by a slight concavity in the middle, to the exten- sores pollicis; the external margin, by a rough surface, to

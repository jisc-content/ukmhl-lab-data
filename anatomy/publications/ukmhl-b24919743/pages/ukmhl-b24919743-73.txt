49 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Section II. The Bones of the Trunk. 33. We commence the osteology with the description of the bones of the trunk, which comprises all those of the vertebral column or spine, of the thorax, and pelvis. The general Characters of the Vertebrae. The vertebral column is made up of a range of bones termed vertebrae, from their mobility (verto, to turn), cf these, twenty-four are separate and moveable upon one another, and thence called true vertebrae; the other five, though originally distinct, become united into one piece, called the sacrum, to the extremity of which is appended the coccyx, consisting of three portions. The parts of the sacrum and coccyx are termed false vertebrae. The vertebral column, together with the sacrum and coc- cyx, is situated at the posterior part of the trunk; ante- riorly it presents the form of an irregular pyramid ; poste- riorly along the median line, a series of elongated processes (spinae), disposed regularly one beneath the other, from which circumstance the term “ spine” is derived. The size of the vertebrae increases from above down- wards as far as the first pieces of the sacrum, from which it diminishes towards the end of the coccyx, where it termi- nates by a point, so that it may be said to consist of two pyramids applied to one another at their bases. The su- perior or moveable one, however, does not taper regularly from above downwards in its entire length; it becomes somewhat narrowed and constricted as it were, at the third dorsal vertebra, after which it gradually enlarges towards its base. The true vertebrae are divided into three sets, named from the regions which they occupy, cervical, dorsal, lum- bar. The sacrum and coccyx which form the remaining part of the column, shall be described with the bones of the e

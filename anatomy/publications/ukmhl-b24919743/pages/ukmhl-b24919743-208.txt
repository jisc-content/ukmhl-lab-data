The synovial membrane lines the articulating surfaces of the tibia and fibula above described, as well as the liga- ments which connect them. The Ankle Joint. 184. The articulation consists of the inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula, united so as to form an arch, into which the superior convex surface of the astragalus is re- ceived. Their contiguous surfaces are covered with carti- lage, lined by a synovial membrane, and retained in contact by the following ligaments. The internal lateral ligament (ligamentum deltoides) is a broad, flat fasciculus of fibres, one extremity of which is attached to the inferior border of the internal malleolus, the other to the inner side of the as- tragalus and os calcis. It is broader below than above ; its cutaneous surface is covered by the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle ; the articular one is lined by the synovial membrane. The external lateral ligament consists of three distinct fasciculi of fibres, separated by intervals, and disposed in different directions. 1. The central one (ligamentum Jibulce medium) descends perpendicularly from the extremity of the fibula, and is inserted into the middle of the external sur- face of the os calcis. 2. The anterior fasciculus (ligamen- tum jibulce anterius) passes obliquely forwards from the in- ferior extremity of the fibula, to the anterior border of the articular surface of the astragalus ; it is the shortest of the three. 3. The posterior (ligamentum jibulce posterius), the strongest of the three ligaments, passes obliquely back- wards from the extremity of the fibula, towards the poste- rior surface of the astragalus, where it is inserted into the border of the groove for the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. 185.

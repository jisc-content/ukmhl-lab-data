ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 442 parts, the larger one being, from its situation, named sca- lenus medius, the smaller the scalenus posticus. Action.â€”These muscles draw down the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and thereby bend that part of the spinal column to one side. The inter-transversales and rectus lateralis of each side act in the same way, all conspiring to incline the head as well as the vertebrae laterally. This movement may be alter- nated by bringing the opposite muscles into action. If both act together, the head and spine will be maintained erect. When the scaleni take their fixed points above, they draw on the first ribs, rendering them fixed, as a preparatory step to making a forcible inspiration. 467. The rectus capitis anticus major appears like a continuation of the scalenus anticus, being prolonged up- wards from the points at which it ceases. This muscle arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of four cervical vertebrae (from the third to the sixth inclusive) by so many tendinous processes. It ascends, converging somewhat to the corresponding muscle, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum. It is tendinous and fleshy in its structure, and lies behind the pharynx and great cer- vical vessels. 468. The rectus capitis anticus minor is a short, narrow muscle, lying behind the superior part of the preceding. It arises from the fore part of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the basilar process, between the last muscle and the margin of the foramen magnum. 469. The rectus lateralis is as short as the preceding, but thicker. It arises from the upper surface of the trans- verse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the rough ridge, external to the condyloid process of the occipital bone. It completes the series of the inter-transversales muscles, and supports the internal jugular vein at its exit from the skull.

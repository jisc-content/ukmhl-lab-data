ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 474 distributing branches. In its course, the following branches are given off: a. —Small twigs to the digastricus and stylo-hyoideus, and some of a larger size to the sterno-mastoid. b. —An auricular branch to the back part of the concha of the ear, and two or three to the splenius and trachelo-mastoid. c. —Arteria princeps cervicis is of considerable size, and some- times as large as the continuation of the vessel. When this is the case, it descends beneath the complexus, towards the lower part of the neck, and anastomoses freely with the cervicalis profunda of the subclavian. Some branches of this vessel pass outwards to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, communicating with the cervicalis ascendens, and the external ramifications of the verte- bral artery. d. —A meningeal branch, which enters the skull, through the fo- ramen lacerum posterius, and ramifies in the dura mater, investing the cerebellum. e. —The superficial or cranial branches of the occipital artery pursue rather a tortuous course, and as they proceed forwards on the skull separate into three divisions, which ramify upon it; -these communicate with the branches of the corresponding artery on the one hand, with those of the posterior auris on the other, and with the temporal artery in front. 526. 6. The auricularis posterior is a small vessel, which arises sometimes from the occipital artery, but in most in- stances from the carotid, a little higher up than the latter. It ascends in the direction of the fold or angle formed by the cartilage of the ear, with the side of the head, and finally, after having passed above the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, it divides into two sets of ramusculi, of which, one inclines forwards, to anastomose with the rami- fications of the temporal artery, the other backwards, to communicate with the occipital. In its course, the follow- ing branches are given off: a.—Some small twigs to the parotid gland and digastricus.

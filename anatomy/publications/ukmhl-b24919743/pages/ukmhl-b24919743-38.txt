elements OF ANATOMY. 14- unsuited to the purposes of those who are commencing the study of anatomy. The descriptions which they give of different parts of the body are, doubtless, sufficiently full and clear, yet, as each system of organs is considered sepa- rately, and, as it were, apart from the others, the student finds himself constrained whilst prosecuting his pursuits from day to day, to consult different parts of the same vo- lume, and, not unfrequently, different volumes of the same work. Anatomy, or rather the process of dissection, re- sembles that of analysis, as its object is to resolve a part, or the whole of an organized structure into its proximate con- stituents, in order to ascertain their outward conformation, volume, relative proportions, and physical properties. Though the books just referred to furnish all the necessary information on these subjects, they have been found insuf- ficient as guides to the inexperienced, inasmuch as they convey no information as to the mode of conducting the analysis. To remedy this defect some works have been published on a plan altogether different from that of the systematic treatises. In these, instead of treating seriatim et singulalim of the different systems of organs of which the body is composed, it has been considered as divisible into regions, each requiring anatomical investigation; and as into each of these enters some part of all the organic sys- temsâ€”as it is supported by the osseous, moved by the muscular, nourished by the vascular, and derives sensibility from the nervous ; these are examined, not separately and in detail, but collectively, as they are grouped together by nature in the regions which they occupy. These views were suggested by the study of anatomy in relation to ope- rative surgery, and have constituted the basis on which the works of Burns, Colies, Harrison, Velpeau, and Blendin, have been constructed; which are obviously intended for persons somewhat advanced in their studies, as their rea- ders are pre-supposed to be acquainted with at least the outlines of anatomy.

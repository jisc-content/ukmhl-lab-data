THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. 155 passes up to the basilar process. These appendages form a cross with the transverse ligament, and serve to bind the occiput to the two first vertebrae; from this is derived the term cruciform, which is sometimes applied to the trans- verse ligament. 111. The anterior atlo-axoid ligament passes from the border of the lesser arch of the atlas, and its tubercle, to the body of the axis and the root of its odontoid process. It is thin and membranous. 112. The posterior atlo-axoid ligament connects the posterior arch of the atlas with the plates of the axis. Thus the interstices between the plates or arches, which in all the other vertebrae are filled by the ligamenta subflava, are occupied by membrane between the second and first, as well as between the latter and the occiput. Two synovial membranes are placed between the articu- lating processes of the atlas and axis. One between the odontoid process and the transverse ligament, another be- tween it and the arch of the atlas. The Articulations of the Ribs. The ligaments of the ribs may be divided into three sets: 1, those which connect them with the bodies of the verte- brae ; 2, with their transverse processes; 3, with the ster- num. 113. The costo-vertebral ligaments (ligamenta capituli costarum) consist : 1. Of an anterior ligament which con- nects the head of each rib with the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae; its fibres, flat and radiated, are divided into three bundles, of which the middle one passes horizontally for- wards upon thecorresponding inter-vertebral cartilage, whilst the superior ascends to the body of the vertebra above it, and the inferior descends to that below. From the diver- gence of its fibres this is usually called the stellate liga- ment. 2ndly. Of an inter-articular ligament, which is a band of fibres passing transversely from the head of the

213 QUADRATUS FEMORIS. the os pubis, extending from near its symphysis as far as the margin of the obturator foramen, from the obturator mem- brane, except where it is pierced for the transmission of the obturator vessels, and from the inner flat surface of the is- chium as far back as the sciatic notch, on a level with a line drawn from the upper margin of the obturator foramen, backwards to that of the notch. The fibres converge to a tendon which passes out of the pelvis by the inferior sciatic notch, and is inserted into the trochanteric fossa between the gemelli muscles. Direction—it at first passes back- wards, then is reflected over a pulley-like surface on the ischium, situated between the spine and tuberosity of that bone, after which it proceeds horizontally outwards, so that the internal and external portions form a considerable angle with one another: structure—fleshy, whilst within the pel- vis; its tendon flat and uniform on its posterior surface pre- sents at its anterior aspect four small tendinous bundles, which slide in separate grooves on the surface of the is- chium : relations—within the pelvis it is covered by the internal pudic artery and obturator fascia, which separates it from the levator ani muscle, its tendon lies on the is- chium and fibrous capsule of the hip joint, being covered by the great sciatic nerve and gluteus maximus muscle; its borders are enclosed between the gemelli. 232. The quadrat us femoris (ischio-sous-trochanterien, Chauss.; tuber-ischio-trochanterien, Dumas) is situated at the posterior and superior part of the thigh. Form—an oblong square. It arises from the external curved border of the tuber ischii, and is inserted into the lower half of the posterior border of the great trochanter; its middle corre- sponding w'itli a smooth rising or tuberosity observable in that border. The line of insertion of this muscle may pro- bably be called linea quadrata, to distinguish it from the inter-trochanteric line, the latter being oblique in its direc- tion, the former vertical. Direction—horizontally outwards : structure—-slightly tendinous at its attachments, fleshy in

LYMPHATIC VESSELS. 281 ankle, where they come into contact with the saphena vein. Along this vessel, which may be said to guide or conduct them in their course, the lymphatics ascend towards the in- side of the knee. In their passage they communicate with similar vessels (but fewer in number) which run along the external and posterior sides of the limb, and finally termi- nate near the knee in those which accompany the saphena vein. Still following the course of the vessel just referred to, and maintaining constant communications on each side, the superficial lymphatics ascend along the inner and ante- rior part of the thigh, and, beneath Poupartâ€™s ligament, pass into the superficial inguinal glands, from which several vasa efferentia proceed, and after dipping down through the sa- phenic opening in the fascia lata, join the deep-seated lym- phatic vessels, which accompany the femoral and iliac ves- sels upwards into the abdomen. The superficial inguinal glands receive the lymphatics which descend from the fore- part of the abdomen, together with the superficial epigastric vessels, as well as those which accompany the external pudic branches, and transmit them onwards to the same desti- nation as those whose course we have above indicated. 298. The deep-seated lymphatic vessels lie under cover of the fascia lata, embedded amongst the muscles. They accompany the femoral vessels and their various ramifica- tions, and may be said to arise from the parts to which these vessels are distributed. One or two branches twine round the anterior tibial artery, and with it pass through the opening in the inter-osseous ligament; another set com- mences in the sole of the foot, and follows the posterior tibial artery up to the ham, where they receive the anterior vessels; a third proceeds to the same point, guided by the peroneal artery, and all three open into the popliteal glands, A fourth set, commencing on the external side of the dor- sum of the foot, runs behind the outer ankle, w'here they meet the external saphena vein, with which they ascend upon the muscles of the calf of the leg, to terminate in the

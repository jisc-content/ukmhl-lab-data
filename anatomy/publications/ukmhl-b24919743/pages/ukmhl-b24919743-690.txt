ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 644 texture for some way, it was found that the external fibres of the diseased nerve could be traced from the commissure directly backwards to the brain at the same side, so could the external fibres of the sound nerve; thus shewing that no decussation took place between them; but the internal fibres of the diseased nerve could be traced obliquely through the commissure, and also backwards along the inner side of the opposite nerve to its origin, whilst the inner fibres of the sound nerve seemed, but not so distinctly, to cross also to the opposite side. Each of these opposing opinions, then, is borne out by observations to a certain extent, so that the advocates of them are not warranted in con- cluding that either is universally or even generally true. Pro- fessor Meckel supposes that the anterior or orbital parts of the nerves issue from a common point (the commissure), produced by a union of the fibres which are prolonged from the brain, and that the mode of union is not quite identical in all cases, for that, in the different other structures which are joined along the middle line, varieties in the manner and degree of their union are constantly observed to occur. 679. The third pair (motores oculorum, par tertium) arises from the inner borders of the crura cerebri, near the locus perforatus, and about two lines anterior to the pons Varolii. This is only the point at which the nerve issues from the cerebral substance, and becomes invested by its neurilema and a tubular sheath of arachnoid membrane, for its fibres can be traced backwards into the grey sub- stance within the cerebral protuberance, if the pons Varolii be removed. The nerve passes forwards, and a little out- wards, to enter a canal appropriated to it in the dura mater, close by the posterior clinoi'd process, at which point its serous investment leaves it, and becomes con- tinuous with that which lines the dura mater. As the nerve proceeds forwards it lies along the external wall of the cavernous sinus, being at first placed superior and in- ternal to the fourth, and the ophthalmic of the fifth and the sixth nerves ; as it approaches the sphenoidal fissure it

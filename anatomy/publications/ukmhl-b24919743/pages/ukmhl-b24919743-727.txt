681 THE EYEâ€”ITS APPENDAGES. cisions may then be carried over the ball of the eye, decussating with one another at the optic nerve, and thereby dividing the scle- rotica into four eliptic segments. When these are everted they can be detached, and the choroid exposed. In order to exhibit the retina the eye should be fixed, and the same incisions made through the sclerotica. The apparatus may then be immersed in a bowl of water, in order that the humours may be supported when the exterior membranes are removed. But in separating the choroid two pair of forceps should be used, one being employed to pinch up and hold a small portion of it, whilst it is torn with the other. This process may be continued until the whole of the vascular membrane is detached and everted, leaving the retina fully exposed. The Appendages of the Eye. 720. The appendages of the eye comprise the eye-brow and eye-lids, the lachrymal apparatus, the muscles of the orbit, the opthalmic artery and vein, with the nerves. The eye-brow is the arched ridge which surmounts the upper border of the orbit, extending from near the root of the nose to the temple. It consists of integument rather thickened, and giving insertion to short hairs which are in- serted obliquely into it, also of a lamella of adipose tissue, and of the orbicular and corrugator supercilii muscles. The eye-lids (palpebree.) are two thin moveable curtains placed in front of the eye, and calculated to conceal it, or leave it exposed, as occasion may require. The upper lid, which is larger and more moveable than the other, has a muscle exclusively intended for its elevation, whilst the lower one is raised up only by the action of the inferior half of the orbicular muscle. Externally the lids are covered by in- tegument, which is thin and delicate ; internally they are lined by the conjunctiva, which is more vascular than where it passes over the ball of the eye. Between these

19 INTRODUCTION. bearing in mind the leading' facts, which its examination has disclosed, we recollect the course taken by its main artery, the femoral. If the knee be somewhat bent, and the limb turned outwards, the direction of that vessel is at once marked out by a line extended from midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ileum and the symphisis pubis, to the lower margin of the patella: this position applies so far as the vessel retains the name femoral, which is only for two-thirds of the length of the thigh ; for at the junction of the middle with the lower third the vessel changes its name, at the same time that it alters its relation to the bone, and is denominated popliteal. In the upper third of this course the vessel is uncovered by mus- cle, and is therefore the part most eligible for its compres- sion, or the application of ligatures, whilst in the middle third it is deeply seated, and less favourably circumstanced. Now all these facts, with which every surgeon should be accurately acquainted, may be expressed, if such a phrase be allowable, by the incisions which the dissector is in- structed to make, with these additional advantages, that they are the most convenient that can be adopted for prosecuting the different steps of his examination, at the same time that they serve to leave a lasting impression on the mind; for, to use the words of Locke, “ constantly repeated ideas cannot be lost.” If this routine were ad- hered to strictly in the composition of an anatomical work, it would have embarrassed its arrangements with rather a complex division of the subject; on this account it has been deemed advisable to complete the description of the bones and their articulations, previously to entering on the consideration of the other structures. 14. In concluding these introductory remarks, it may not be amiss to point out the best sources from which informa- tion maybe obtained on the subject of Anatomy, general as well as descriptive, a duty the more willingly undertaken, as it affords the author an opportunity of acknowledging c 2

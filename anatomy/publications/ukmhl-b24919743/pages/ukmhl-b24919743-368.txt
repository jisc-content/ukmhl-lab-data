Finally, if examined above this point of bone, it will be found prolonged deeply into the lumbar region as far as the anterior lamella of the fascia lumborum, on which it gradually degenerates into cellular tissue. As the membrane extends inwards to the middle line (for we here confine our attention to one lateral half of it,) it becomes closely adherent to the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, and where it lies behind the rectus, it becomes thin and weak. If from this point it be traced downwards, it will be found, after lining the rectus, to pass along the inner surface of the pubic symphysis, and thence down to the point at which the urethra escapes from the pelvis, where it is reflected backwards upon the upper surface of the neck of the bladder, on which it is gradually lost. Along the lower border of the abdomen the membrane may be said to terminate at Poupart’s liga- ment, at least in all that part of its extent which is included between the anterior superior spine of the ileum and the exit of the vessels, where, by uniting with the fascia iliaca, it forms a complete cul-de-sac, the junction being indicated by a white line running from without inwards; but this does not exactly correspond with the margin of Poupart’s liga- ment. Now in that space which is included between the external border of the femoral artery, and the base of Gim- bernat’s ligament, the membrane cannot pass backwards to join the fascia iliaca, inasmuch as the vessels are interposed between them. Hence it is prolonged down behind Pou- part’s ligament, guided as it were by the vessels, and forming the anterior half of the membranous tube that invests them, and which has been already more than once alluded to. It will be recollected that the fascia transversalis forms the entire of the smaller prolongation that invests the spermatic vessels, as they escape through the internal ring.

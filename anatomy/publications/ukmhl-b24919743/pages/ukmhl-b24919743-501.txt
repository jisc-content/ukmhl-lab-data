459 ZIGOMATICI. guli oris; musculus caninus') lies beneath the preceding, and partly concealed by it. It arises immediately below the infra-orbital foramen, from the canine fossa, whence the name caninus, and is inserted into the angle of the mouth. It can be seen by drawing in opposite directions the levator labii superioris, and the zigomatici, which overlap it. 502. The zigomatici are two narrow fasciculi of muscu- lar fibres, extended obliquely from the most prominent point of the cheek, to the angle of the mouth, one being larger and longer than the other, a. The zigomaticus minor (when it exists, which is not always the case) arises from the anterior and inferior part of the malar bone, and inclines downwards and forwards to terminate at the angle of the mouth. It lies along the superior border of the suc - ceeding muscle, b. The zigomaticus major arises from the malar bone near the zigomatic suture, from which it de- scends, lying inferior and external to the lesser muscle of the same name, to be inserted into the angle of the mouth. These muscles are subcutaneous in their entire extent. The larger one covers, at its origin, a part of the masseter, and at its insertion, of the triangularis oris, with which, and the other muscles of the lip, its fibres are intimately blended. 503. The compressor narium is a thin small muscle, con- cealed at its origin and fleshy part, by the proper elevator of the lip, lying between the side of the nose and the common elevator. It arises narrow and fleshy from the canine fossa, from which its fibres proceed upwards and inwards, gradually expanding into a thin aponeurosis, which is partly blended with that of the corresponding muscle, and partly attached upon the dorsum of the nose. The direction of its fibres is transverse with regard to that of the muscle under which it lies. 504. The depressor labii superioris alceque nasi, is a small flat muscle, extended from the alveolar border of the

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 174 deeply in the groove formed by the ileum and sacrum, and covered by the origin of the lumbar muscles. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of some thin irregular fibres, placed at the anterior aspect of the sacro-iliac symphysis, and attached to the pelvic surfaces of the sacrum and ileum. 166. The pubic articulation (symphysis pubis) is formed by the junction of the ossa pubis in the median line ante- riorly. This is effected by an elongated piece of fibro- cartilage, interposed between their surfaces, and connected to each. It is thicker anteriorly than posteriorly, and con- sists of concentric lamellae. This union is strengthened, 1st, by an anterior pubic ligament, which consists of irregu- lar fibres, passing obliquely across from one bone to the other, and decussating on the anterior surface of the carti- lage ; 2ndly, the sub pubic ligament, (ligamentum triangu- lare, arcuatum,) thick and triangular, which is placed be- neath the symphysis, its sides being attached to the rami of the pubis, its base free and slightly concave, directed down- wards and backwards to the perinaeal space. 167. The obturator ligament (membrana obturans fora- minis thyreoidis, Soemm.) is properly a fibrous membrane, inserted into the border of the obturator foramen, which it closes in its entire extent, except at the superior part of its circumference, where a small oval aperture is left for the exit of the obturator vessels. The obturator muscles are attached to its surfaces. The Hip Joint. 168. This is a true ball and socket joint, in which the globular head of the femur is received into the cotyloid ca- vity. The articulating surfaces are covered by cartilage in the greater part of their extent. It is deficient however at the bottom of the cavity, and also a little beneath the cen- tral point of the head of the femur ; the latter marking the insertion of the round ligament, the former a shallow fossa

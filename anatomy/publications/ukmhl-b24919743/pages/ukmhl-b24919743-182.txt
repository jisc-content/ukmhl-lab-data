ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 158 ed by the internal maxillary artery and dental nerve. Its in- ner surface is concealed by the internal pterygoid muscle. 118. The stylo-maxillary ligament, thin and aponeurotic, passes from near the point of the styloid process to the in- ner border of the angle of the jaw, where it is interposed between the masse ter and internal pterygoid muscles. 119. The inter-articular cartilage, oval, elongated from before backwards, thicker at its margins than at the centre, where it is sometimes perforated, is placed horizontally be- tween the articular surfaces. Its inferior surface, which is in contact with the condyle, is concave; the superior, con- cave from before backwards, is a little convex from side to side towards its two extremities, conforming in some way with the outline of the glenoid cavity. Its circumference is connected at each side with the lateral ligaments, and ante- riorly with the external pterygoid muscle. The synovial membrane, after lining the upper surface of the inter-articular cartilage, is reflected upwards on the la- teral ligaments, and over the smooth part of the glenoid cavity; a similar membrane is interposed between the in- ferior surface of the cartilage and the condyle, so as to constitute a double joint. Of the Articulations of the Superior Extremities. These may be arranged under the following heads, taking them in their anatomical order, from above down- wards : 1, the articulation between the trunk and the limbs; 2, those of the scapula; 3, of the elbow; 4, of the wrist; 5, of the hand; 6, of the fingers. 120. The superior extremity has but one point of bony at- tachment to the trunk, namely, that at the sterno-clavicular articulation, the scapula being connected with the trunk, and head by muscles only. The clavicle is connected with the first bone of the sternum, its fellow of the opposite side, and the first rib, by the following ligaments. 1. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament passes from

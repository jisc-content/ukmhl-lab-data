3f>9 CHAPTER VI. Section I. THE MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 370. The muscles of the upper extremity, taken in the order of their situation, may be divided into four groups, viz. those placed on the shoulder, those on the arm, on the fore-arm, and on the hand. We must however commence the description of the moving powers of the limb, with that of the two pectoral muscles, and the serratus magnus. 371. The pectoralis major (slerno-costo-clavio-humeral) is placed on the anterior and upper part of the thorax, and in front of the axilla. It is broad and expanded at the former situation, narrowing gradually towards the latter, and arises from the sternal half, or a little more, of the cla- vicle,â€”from half the anterior surface of the sternum, ex- tending as far down as the insertion of the cartilage of the sixth rib, and from the cartilages of the true ribs, except the first and last. In some cases also a fleshy slip is derived from the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, where it co- vers the rectus muscle. From this extensive origin the fleshy fibres proceed, converging towards the tendon of in- sertion ; those from the clavicle, which are usually separated from the rest by a cellular interval, pass downwards and outwards, those from the lower cartilages obliquely upwards, the middle set horizontally. The muscular fibres become continuous with those of the tendon, and still retain their original direction as they proceed to their respective points of insertion into the humerus; and as the superior fibres descend, whilst the inferior ones ascend, the latter passing behind the former, their arrangement gives to the muscle a folded or twisted appearance along its axillary border, 2 B

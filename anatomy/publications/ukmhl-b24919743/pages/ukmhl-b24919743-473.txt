433 CHAPTER VIE Section I. MUSCLES OF THE NECK AND FACE. 448. The muscles of the neck are numerous, and at flirt sight appear to be rather complex in their distribution. They may be grouped into sets as follows. 1. Those placed at the lateral part of the neck being, at least com- paratively, superficial, viz. the platisma myoides, and sterno- mastoideus. 2. The muscles placed in front, lying beneath the os hyoides, viz. the sterno-hyoideus, sterno-thyroideus, thyro-hyoideus, crico-thyroideus, and omo-hyoideus. 3. Those placed obliquely at the upper part of the neck, viz. the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, stylo-pharyn- geus. 4. Muscles placed towards the fore part, and above the os hyoides, viz. the mylo-hyoideus, genio-hyoideus, liyo- glossus, genio-hyo-glossus, and lingualis. 5. Those placed deeply at the side and front of the vertebral column, viz. the scaleni, rectus lateralis, rectus anticus major and minor, and the longus colli. All these are in pairs at each side. Two muscles are placed superficially at the side of the neck. 449. The platisma myoides is a flat, thin plane of mus- cular fibres placed immediately beneath the skin of the neck. Its fibres commence in the cellular tissue, covering the upper part of the deltoid and pectoral muscles, and thence proceed upwards and inwards, converging to the muscle of the opposite side. They pass over the margin of the inferior maxillary bone, some of them adhering to it, and are thence prolonged upon the side of the cheek as far as the angle of the mouth, where they become blended with the muscles in that situation. This part of the muscle, 2 F

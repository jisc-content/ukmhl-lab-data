THE TESTESâ€”THEIR INVESTMENTS. 529 the lines of reflexion. This is the way in which the tunica vaginalis is derived from the peritonaeum, and the position in which the testis is placed with regard to it. 587. Whilst passing through the canal, the testis and cord become covered by the cremaster (p. 193), and at the external ring by the fascia of the cord (p. 324), exterior to which, lie the superficial fascia and the integument. These structures we shall now consider as they are found in the adult. 588. 1. The skin on the pubes is supported by a thick cushion of yellow, adipose matter, and studded with hairs after puberty. From thence and from the sides it is pro- longed on the body of the penis, forming a complete and close investment for it, as far as the extremity of the corpora cavernosa; at this point it is continued forwards, forming a loose and unattached fold called p>rePucei which is intended to protect the glans. The margin of the prepuce termi- nates in a red line, where it becomes continuous with the mucous membrane. The latter may be traced down to the corona glandis, forming a lining for the prepuce, and thence over the glans to the orifice of the urethra, of whose lining membrane it may be regarded as a prolongation. From beneath the meatus urinarius to the base of the glans, the membrane is thrown into a fold, called frcenum prceputii. In the interval between the root of the penis and the peri- naeum the integument is distended into a cul-de-sac, in- tended to contain the testes, and called scrotum. Its surface is of a darker colour than elsewhere; it is also thrown into several rugae, or folds, and marked along the middle line by a slightly elevated ridge or raphe, extending from the penis along the centre of the perinaeum to the margin of the anus. 589. 2. The dartos is a thin lamella of a peculiar tex- ture, placed beneath the skin, and so disposed as to form two sacks, each containing the testis of the corresponding 2 M

THE PARIETAL BONES. 105 sents slight depressions for the insertion of muscles, and the upper one a shallow groove. The superior borders of the bone are dentated, and converge to a point; the infe- rior are divided into two parts by a prominent piece of bone, the jugal eminence, which surmounts an excavation con- tributing with the temporal bone to form the jugular fossa. The occipital articulates with six bones, viz. with the two parietal by its superior borders—the two temporal by the inferior—with the sphenoid by its basilar process, and with the atlas by the condyles. - Attachments of Muscles.—The posterior third of the superior curved line gives attachment to the trapezius; its anterior two thirds to the occipito-frontalis above, and to the sterno- mastoid below: the inner part of the space between the ridges, to the complexus : the external part to the splenius capitis : the space between the lower ridge and the great fo- ramen, to the recti majores and minores, and more outwardly to the obliquus superior: the base of the jugal eminences to the recti laterales : the fossae at the inferior surface of the ba- silar process, to the recti antici majores and minores; and still more anteriorly to the superior constrictor of the pha- rynx. The Parietal Bones. 75. The parietal bones form the roof of the skull; they are convex externally, concave internally, and present two sur- faces and four borders. The external surface rises towards its middle, where it presents the parietal prominence, be- low which is an oblique line, bounding a flat surface, which forms a part of the temporal fossa. The internal surface is marked by branching lines corresponding with the course of the middle meningeal artery, by depressions for the con- volutions of the brain, and along the superior border is a slight groove, corresponding with the longitudinal sinus. The superior border is straight, and articulated with its fellow by a series of dentations; the inferior, concave, and

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 282 deep lymphatics, or in the popliteal glands. From these glands three or four trunks issue, which, after passing through the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, re- ceive all the minor ramifications in their course through the thigh, and end in the deep inguinal glands. The vasa ef- ferentia from these glands pass up into the abdomen, along with the iliac vessels, but in order to come into contact with them, they must necessarily pierce the funnel-shaped pro- longation sent down to invest them by the fascia iliaca and transversalis. After piercing the inner side of this mem- branous tube (which by their numerous perforations they render cribriform) they pass through a large lymphatic gland, situated in the crural ring, after which they twine round the iliac vessels, dividing into offsets, and uniting again, so as to form a sort of net-work. Finally, the lym- phatics here described converge towards those of the oppo- site side, at the bifurcation of the aorta, and the commence- ment of the inferior cava, round which they form a plexus similar to that on the iliac vessels, and on reaching the se- cond, or third lumbar vertebra, they terminate in one of the trunks that open into the receptaculum chyli, or com- mencement of the thoracic duct. All the vessels which we have described as ramifying on the exterior of the pelvis, viz. the gluteal, sciatic, obtura- tor, &c. are accompanied by lymphatics, which follow their course, and unite to form a plexus round the internal iliac vessels, which however finally opens into the larger lym- phatic trunk that ascends from the lower extremity, accom- panying the femoral and iliac vessels. Section IV. THE NERVES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 299. The nerves intended to communicate the power of sensation and motion to the lower extremity, are derived from the lumbar and sacral plexus, that is, from a net-work,

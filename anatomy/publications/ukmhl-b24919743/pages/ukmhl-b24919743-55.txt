( PRIMARY TISSUES. 31 modified in various ways, may be said to form the greater number of the structures of the body; and when within its texture are deposited the globules, muscular fibre, and nervous fibre, are the results ; but the circumstances which determine the production of the one or the other cannot as yet be assigned.* Adopting this three-fold division of the anatomical ele- ments, we may with Bedard*}* and De BlainvilleJ arrange the different textures of the body in the following order. 1. The cellular tissue, which is the element by far the most generally diffused, and which enters more or less into the composition of all the organs of the body. It has been variously denominated, cellular, areolar, la- nar, mucous, &c. It is made up of pale, elastic, and extremely fine filaments, interwoven in different ways, so as to form areolae, or spaces of variable size and figure, and calculated to contain such fluids as may be deposited with them. It possesses what may be termed the hygrometric property, by which it is ena- bled to absorb a portion of any fluids into which it may happen to be immersed, an effect which proba- bly is produced by imbibition, or capillary attrac- tion. a. When condensed or compressed, the cellular tissue forms the cutis, or true skin, which invests the exterior of the body, and is endowed with the power of secreting and depositing upon its surface a concrete lamella, (epidermis) which serves to moderate the effect of ex- ternal impressions. b.

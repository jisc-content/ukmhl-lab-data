118 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The Nasal Bones. 82. The nasal bones, situated beneath the frontal bone, and between the ascending processes of the maxillary, are small, and irregularly quadrilateral, and form what is called the bridge of the nose:â€”the anterior surface of each, concave from above downwards, convex from side to side, presents a minute vascular foramen; the posterior, or nasal, is marked by the passage of a branch of the nasal nerve ; the superior border articulates with the frontal bone; the inferior with the nasal cartilage; the external with the ascending process of the maxillary bone ; the internal with its fellow of the op- posite side, and is supported by the nasal spine of the fron- tal, and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. They give attachment to the pyramidalis and compressor nasi. The Os Unguis. 83. Placed at the inner and anterior part of the orbit, it presents two surfaces and four borders ; its external surface, plane in the greater part of its extent, is hollowed anteriorly, by a groove which lodges part of the lachrymal sac; hence this bone is sometimes called the lachrymal bone. Part of the internal surface, which is rough, corresponds with the anterior ethmoidal cells, the rest with the middle meatus narium. The superior border is articulated with the orbitar process of the frontal bone ; the inferior with the superior maxillary bone; and where it dips down, to form the la- chrymal groove, it joins the inferior spongy bone; anteri- orly, it rests on the nasal processes of the superior maxil- lary bone, and posteriorly on the os planum of the ethmoid. The Palate Bone. 84. The palate bone, wedged in between the superior maxillary and sphenoid bones, is common to the cavity of the mouth, nares, and orbit.

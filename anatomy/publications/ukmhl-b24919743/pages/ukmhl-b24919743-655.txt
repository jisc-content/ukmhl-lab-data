THE 13 R A IN â€” ITS EXTERN A L SURFACE. fill The Brain. 655. The brain forms the largest portion of the central mass of the nervous system, and occupies the principal part of the cranial cavity. It extends from the frontal bone to the occipital fossae, resting on the orbital pro- cesses of the former, on the tentorium cerebelli posteriorly, and in the centre descends into the middle fossae, at the base of the skull. Its superior surface is convex and arched, corresponding with the vault of the cranium, be- neath which it is placed, and presents along the middle line a deep fissure, running from before backwards, by which it is divided into two equal parts (hemispheres). The surface of the brain is rendered unequal by several depressions and elevations marked upon it. The eleva- tions are called convolutions (gyri), and are situated be- tween the depressions {sulci). The course of the convo- lutions is winding and tortuous, as the name implies, and their size presents many varieties in different places. It should be observed that the anterior extremity of the brain, which corresponds with the frontal bone, is narrower than the posterior, which is received into the occipital fossae. 656. The external surface of each hemisphere is convex in its general outline; the internal is flat and compressed, as it rests against its fellow of the opposite side, the falx major being interposed between them. The inferior sur- face presents several depressions and inequalities, corres- ponding with those of the base of the skull. On this sur- face is observed the division of the hemispheres into three lobes. The anterior lobe rests on the orbital process of the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone ; the posterior is supported on the tentorium cerebelli; and the middle is received into the central fossa, at the base of the skull. The anterior is separated from the middle lobe by a deep fissure (Jissura Sj/lvii), but there is 2 r 2

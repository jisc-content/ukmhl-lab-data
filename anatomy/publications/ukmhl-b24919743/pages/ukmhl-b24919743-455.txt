NERVES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITIES. 415 Section V. THE NERVES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITIES. 433. The nerves of each upper extremity are derived from the anterior branches of the four last cervical, and first dorsal pairs of the same side. These unite in a peculiar way to form an interlacement called the axillary or brachial plexus, which extends from opposite the sixth cervical ver- tebra to the coracoid process. In the neck, the branches which form it, lie between the scaleni muscles; closely ag- gregated together, they pass downwards and outwards into the axillary space, between the subclavius muscle and the first rib, and are placed to the acromial side of the accompa- nying artery. From this nervous interlacement, several nerves proceed, which may be divided into three sets. 1. The first consists of those which pass off rather high up from the plexus, viz. the supra-scapular, the sub-scapular, and the thoracic, the latter, consisting usually of three branches, all, however, going to nearly the same destination. Oppo- site the coracoid process, the plexus divides into six ulti- mate branches, for the supply of the limb, which may be resolved intoâ€”2, those which reach the hand and fingers, consisting of the ulnar, median, and the spiral nerves ; and 3, those which do not extend so far, namely, the internal cu- taneous, the external cutaneous, and the circumflex nerves. 434. The branches which form this plexus are said by Boyer, and other anatomists, to interlace inextricably. An arrangement of them, however, may be made as fol- lows : a probe may be previously passed across, through the primary divisions of the plexus, so as to divide them into an anterior and posterior set. The anterior branches of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves will be observed, after coming out of the intervertebral foramina, to unite and form a common trunk, which, after giving off the supra- scapular nerve, separates into two divisions. Of these, one.

PALMAR INTEROSSEt. 397 opposite or ulnar border of the tendinous expansion of the extensor communis, that covers the middle finger, d. The fourth, lying in the corresponding space, is inserted into the ulnar side of the ring finger, by becoming attached to the tendinous expansion that covers it. 417. The palmar interossei lie rather on the palmar surface of the hones than in their intervals. They are three in number, and are undivided at their origin, a. The first palmar interosseous muscle arises along the ulnar border of the second metacarpal bone, and is inserted at the same side of the base of the first phalanx of the index finger, where the fibres of its tendon are blended with those of the extensor communis, b. The second arises from the radial border of the fourth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the ring finger, by its radial border, c. The third arises from the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger, by its outer or radial border. Thus the index and ring fingers have each two inter- ossei muscles (one palmar, and one dorsal); the middle finger has two of the dorsal set, and the little finger has one of the palmar. Actions.â€”All the interossei muscles act on the first phalanges of the fingers. They obviously possess the power of adduction and abduction, according to the manner of their insertion, and so can make the fingers diverge from, or approach to one another. The dorsal set may, to a certain extent, assist the extensor com- munis, in extending or drawing back the fingers; and again, if the fingers be but slightly bent, as the direction of the interossei in that position forms an angle with that of the phalanges, they may assist in drawing them to the palm of the hand, that is, in flexing them.

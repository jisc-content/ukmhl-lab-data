74 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. vered by the expanded fibres of the extensor tendons ; the posterior smooth, and covered with cartilage for its articu- lation with the condyles of the femur, is divided into two parts by a vertical line, the external being the broadest. Beneath these is situated a small irregular depression, cor- responding with the apex, or narrowest part of the bone, which gives attachment to the ligamentum patellae. The superior extremity, broad and rounded off at its margin, gives attachment to the extensor muscles ; the inferior, nar- row and pointed, to the ligament already named; the late- ral borders are convex, the external being thinner than the internal. The Tibia. 50. The tibia next to the femur, is the longest bone in the skeleton; it is situated at the anterior and inner side of the leg, and like the other long bones, is divided into a body and two extremities. The superior extremity, thick and expanded, is broader from side to side, than from be- fore backwards ; its circumference is somewhat rounded and convex in front and at the sides, but slightly hollowed pos- teriorly ; at the fore part is situated an eminence, to which the ligamentum patellae is attached; on the sides, and above this, are two rounded eminences, called tuberosities, the external one being somewhat smaller than the other, and marked on its outer side by a flat surface which arti- culates with the head of the fibula. These give attach- ment to the lateral ligaments, and on their superior aspect may be observed two smooth cartilaginous surfaces, (con- dyle.s) which sustain the condyles of the femur; the inter- nal one is somewhat deeper, its greatest diameter from be- fore backwards, the other being nearly circular. In the in- terval between the articular surfaces, is situated a pyramidal eminence, the summit of which is usually divided into two tubercles, it is named the spinous process of the tibia; be- fore and behind this are two irregularly depressed surfaces,

66 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the other border, sharp and thin, forms part of the margin of the foramen thyroideum. Attachments of Muscles. To the crista is attached the pyrami- dal is and rectus abdominis ; to the tuberosity and anterior surface, the obliquus externus ; to the pectineal line, the pec- tineus and Gimbernatâ€™s ligament; to the crista, and part of the same line, the obliquus internus and transversalis. To the external surface, at the angle, the adductor longus ; to the space between this and the border of the thyroid fora- men, the adductor brevis ; to the line of the symphysis and the ramus, the gracilis; and to the whole margin of the foramen, the obturator externus. To the inner surface, the obturator internus and levator ani. The Ischium. 45. The ischium forms the lowest and posterior part of the os innominatum; it consists of two parts, a body and a ramus, united at an angle, so as to give the bone somewhat the figure of a hook. The body, or larger part, presents an external and an internal surface, two borders, and two extremities. On its external surface may be observed a smooth concave part, which forms more than two-fifths of the acetabulum, and is surrounded by a prominent line, marking the border of that cavity ; beneath this is a groove, directed horizontally, corresponding with the tendon of the obturator externus muscle, and also a rough line, which passes downwards to the tuberosity of the ischium, and gives attachment to the quadratus femoris. The anterior border, thin and sharp, bounds the thyroid foramen; the posterior, broad and expanded, is divided into two parts by a projecting process, (spinous process of the ischium) of which the superior one, flat and smooth, presents nothing deserving particular notice; the inferior, rounded and ex- cavated, forms a pulley-like surface, on which the tendon of the obturator internus muscle runs. The tuberosity, thick and rounded, forms the part on which the body is

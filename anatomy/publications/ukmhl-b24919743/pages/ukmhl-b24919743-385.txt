347 CHAPTER V. THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 347. The muscles placed along the posterior part of the trunk are found to be arranged in layers, or strata, placed one over the other, and differing materially in extent, at- tachments, and use. The superficial muscles are so broad as to cover all the others; and as their extent is consider- able, their number is proportionally diminished, being only two, viz. the trapezius and latissimus dorsi. The second set may be said to consist of the rhomboidei, levator anguli scapulae, the splenii, and serrati postici. In strictness, the two first form a layer by themselves, and so do the two last; but it would tend to no useful purpose to multiply these sub-divisions. In the third set are included the erec- tor spinae, consisting of the sacro-lumbalis, and longissimus dorsi, with their cervical prolongations, viz. the cervicalis descendens, transversalis colli, and trachelo-mastoideus; lastly the complexus. The fourth layer comprises the spina- lis muscle, consisting of two parts, viz., the spinalis colli and spinalis dorsi, the multifidus spinÂ®, the inter spinales, inter- transversales, and, finally, the small muscles placed between the base of the skull and the two first vertebrae, viz., the recti postici and obliqui. 348. The trapezius (cucullaris, Soemm.; occipito-dorsi- sus-acromien, Dumas) extends along the posterior part of the neck, as well as of the back and shoulder. If the two muscles of this name be taken together, they represent a four-sided figure (whence the name) two angles of which correspond with the points of the shoulders, one with the occipital protu- berance, and the fourth with the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebra. The trapezius arises, 1, from the occi- pital protuberance, and from about a third of the oblique

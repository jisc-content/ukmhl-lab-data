ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 124 of osseous matter as dense and hard as the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and the crown is encased by a layer of white, excessively hard substance, called enamel. This, to- wards the superior and lateral parts of the crown, is thick, but gradually becomes thin at the neck, and disappears at the commencement of the root. Within the body of each tooth is a cavity, which decreases in size as we advance in years; it is lined by a membrane, on which the nutritious vessels ramify, after having entered through minute foramina in the apices of the roots. This vascular membrane constitutes the pulp of the tooth, and is abundantly supplied with vessels, and nerves derived from the dental branch of the fifth pair, which in its course through the dental canal, sends filaments up to each tooth. In early infancy the margin of each jaw forms a continuous ridge, covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth; but when examined internally, it is found to contain a certain number of membranous follicles, separated by thin parti- tions. Each of these is composed of two membranes; the internal one, thin and firm, forms a shut sac, and receives the ramifications of the dental vessels: the external one, thick and spongy, appears to be continuous with the peri- osteum of the jaw at the border of the socket, into which it descends, lining it as far as the point where the vessels en- ter ; on these it is reflected, and ascends to the internal sacculus, the exterior of which it invests as far as the en- trance of the vessels; there it is again reflected to the al- veolus, which it lines. Such is the general conformation of the sacculi up to the fourth month of foetal life; at which period the process of ossification begins, and proceeds as follows. At the bottom of the sacculus (adopting that term as a means of distinguishing the internal membrane, or shut sac, from the external one which is reflected over it) a soft, vascular mass arises, supplied with vessels and nerves, derived from those ramified on the sacculus. This mass gradually increases, and assumes the form of the tooth

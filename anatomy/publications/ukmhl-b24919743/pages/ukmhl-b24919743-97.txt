73 THE PATELLA. patella glides. Inferiorly, these surfaces diverge as they pass backwards, and when they terminate at the posterior surface of the bone, are separated by a considerable inter- val. The internal condyle appears longer, and also to descend lower down than the other; but this is rather apparent than real, for by means of the obliquity of the shaft of the bone, both condyles are brought to the same plane. The in- ternal condyle presents at its inner side a tuberosity, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament and the ten- don of the adductor magnus. The external presents also a tuberosity for the external lateral ligaments. In the fossa between the condyles, are implanted the crucial ligaments. Articulations. The femur articulates superiorly with the acetabulum, inferiorly by its condyles with the tibia, and anteriorly with the patella. Attachments of Muscles. To the anterior and two lateral surfaces, and to both lips of the linea aspera, is attached the triceps ex- tensor ; to the centre of that line, the adductors and short head of the biceps flexor ; to the superior border of the tro- chanter major, the gluteus medius, to its anterior border, the gluteus minimus; to the fossa at its inner surface, the exter- nal rotators ; to the lesser trochanter, the tendon of the psoas and iliacus ; to the line between the trochanters, the quadra- tus femoris ; to the line below the lesser trochanter, the pec- tineus; to the rough line descending from the great tro- chanter, the gluteus maximus ; just above the condyles, the gastrocnemius ; to the external condyle, the plantaris; to the fossa beneath the external tuberosity, the popliteus. The Patella. 49. The patella is situated at the anterior part of the knee joint, being attached by a ligament (ligamentum pa- tellae) to the tibia, so that its position varies according to the movements of that bone. Compressed and somewhat triangular in its form, its anterior surface is convex, and co-

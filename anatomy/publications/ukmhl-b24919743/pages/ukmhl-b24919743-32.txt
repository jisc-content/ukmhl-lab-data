8 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. such as injection, maceration, desiccation, chemical re- agents, &c., with a view to arrive at a more intimate knowledge of the composition and structure of the diffe- rent parts of the body. Notwithstanding these changes, the same term has been still retained, and is allowed by general consent to include within its comprehension not only the means employed, but also the end which is sought to be attained. The progress of these changes may be readily traced, by examining some of the anatomical works which have been published at different times; and they whose age has allowed them opportunities of comparing the style and tenor of the courses of lectures delivered by the individuals who have successively discharged the duty of teachers in the schools, are well aware that a consider- able alteration has taken place in the plan and scope of their discourses, as well as in the quantity of information they convey. 7. It is a great mistake to suppose that the practice of medicine or surgery requires only a trifling knowledge of anatomy, or that a loose and general idea of it will suffice for the proper discharge of our professional duties. The history of surgery at once disproves such a notion, by shewing that the fatality attendant on operations has dimi- nished in proportion as anatomy has been more diligently cultivated,-—(the best proof of an improvement in its prac- tice that can be adduced)—and the rapid advances that have of late years been made in establishing the pathology and diagnosis of diseases, more especially of those of the cerebro-spinal system, as well as of the lungs and heart, are altogether attributable to the degree of attention that has been paid to that most important department of study, pa- thological anatomy. The latter position is fully borne out by the great success that has attended the researches of Laennec, Abercrombie, Lallemand, and many others; the former may readily be verified by a reference to the his-

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 134 surface, which supports the commissure of the optic nerves, and, on each side, the optic foramina. Behind this is the pituitary fossa, situated on the body of the sphenoid bone, bounded before and behind by the clinoid processes. Leading downwards and back- wards from these is the basilar groove, which supports the pons varolii and medulla oblongata, and terminates at the foramen magnum ; on each side of this foramen are the condyloid foramina, and behind it a crista, leading upwards to the occipital ridge, and giving attachment to the falx cerebelli. The Orbits. The form of the orbits is that of a quadrilateral pyramid, whose base is directed forwards and outwards, and apex backwards and inwards, so that if their axes were prolonged backwards they would decussate on the body of the sphenoid bone. The roof, which forms part of the floor for the brain, is concave, and composed of the orbitar process of the frontal, and the smaller wing of the sphenoid bone ; at its anterior and inner border may be observed a depression for the attachment of the pulley of the trochlearis muscle; externally, and immediately within the mar- gin of the orbit, a shallow depression for the lachrymal gland; at the anterior border, a groove, sometimes a foramen, which trans- mits the supra-orbital artery and nerve ; and, posteriorly, at the apex of the cavity, the optic foramen, transmitting the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The floor forms the roof of the maxillary sinus ; it consists of the orbitar processes of the malar and max- illary bones, and of the small portion of the palate bone which rests on the latter ; towards the inner and anterior border, near the lachrymal canal, may be observed, a slight roughness for the attachment of the obliquus inferior muscle; posteriorly, a groove, terminating in the infra-orbitar canal, which runs nearly horizontally forwards. The internal surface runs directly back- wards, being parallel with the corresponding side of the other orbit, and is composed of the ascending process of the maxillary bone, the os unguis, the os planum, of the ethmoid, and part of the body ot the sphenoid bone. Near the anterior border is situ- ated the lachrymal canal, which is foriped, for the most part, be- tween the ascending process and body of the maxillary bone, the remainder being made up by the groove in the os unguis, and a

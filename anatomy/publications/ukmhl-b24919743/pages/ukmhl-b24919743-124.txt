100 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. in size, the first being thicker and shorter than the others, which gradually diminish in length from the second to the fifth. They are all slightly concave on the palmar surface, convex on the dorsal, larger at their extremities than in the bodies or middle part, terminated, superiorly, by an un- equal eminence, inferiorly, by a rounded head. The form of the bodies is irregular, but may, in each, be regarded as presenting a palmar, a dorsal, and two lateral surfaces. The palmar surface is narrow, and presents, in the middle, a prominent line, which separates the attach- ments of muscles, and corresponds to the tendons of the flexor muscles; as also in the first, to the opponens and flexor brevis pollicis, and in the third to the adductor pol- licis. The dorsal surface, convex in the first, presents, in the second, third, and fourth, a prominent longitudinal line, which, bifurcating, forms the sides of a triangular surface, extending over two-thirds of their length; in the fifth, also, is observed a prominent longitudinal line, directed, obliquely, from the ulnar to the radial side. The lateral surfaces af- ford attachment to muscles; broad in the four last bones, these surfaces are narrowed, and form merely borders in the first. The superior extremity presents, in each, some peculi- arities which render a separate description necessary; on the first is observed a surface, which is concave in the ante- ro-posterior, and convex in the opposite direction, which articulates with the trapezium; in the second, a concave surface, articulating with the trapezoides; on the radial side, a small surface, which articulates with the trapezium ; on the ulnar side, a double surface, united to the os mag- num, and the third metacarpal bone ; on the third, a nearly plane surface, articulating with the os magnum; on the ra- dial and ulnar sides, surfaces for articulation with the con- tiguous metacarpal bones; on the fourth, two articular sur- faces, connected with the os magnum and unciforme, on the

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 162 the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle, which at its point of attachment to the superior margin of the glenoid cavity, separates into two sets of fibres, which after embrac- ing it, meet and unite inferiorly. These fibres by elevating the border of the cavity, render it a little deeper. 127. The synovial membrane, after lining the glenoid ca- vity, is reflected over its lower margin until it reaches the inner surface of the fibrous capsule, on which it is prolonged as far as the neck of the humerus, where it separates from the capsule, and is applied upon the articular surface of the head of that bone, giving it a smooth investment. At the bicipital groove, the membrane passes down, for about an inch below the margin of the articular cartilage, where it is reflected upon the tendon of the biceps, which guides it to the superior border of the glenoid cavity. Commenc- ing again at the insertion of this tendon, but passing from its upper aspect, we trace the membrane along the supe- rior portion of the capsule, and for some way into the bicipital groove, where it is reflected on the tendon, and so passes back to the point from which we set out. The tendon of the biceps by this arrangement is enclosed in a tube or sheath, formed by the synovial membrane, which invests it when about to pierce the fibrous capsule, so as to maintain the integrity of the articulation. On the superior and external surface of the capsule, a considerable bursa mucosa is situated, by means of which the contiguous surfaces of the coracoid and acromion pro- cesses, and of the coraco-acromion ligament, are rendered smooth and lubricated to facilitate their movements on the subjacent capsule. 128. The coraco-humeral, or accessory ligament extends obliquely over the superior and inner part of the articulation; it is attached to the coracoid process, and thence descends, intimately connected with the capsule, to the greater tube- rosity of the humerus.

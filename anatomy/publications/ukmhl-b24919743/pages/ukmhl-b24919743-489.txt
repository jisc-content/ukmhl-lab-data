447 SOFT PALATE. The soft Palate. 473. The soft palate (velum 'pendulum, palati) forms a partial and moveable curtain between the mouth and pha- rynx. Its upper border is straight, and attached to the margin of the palate bones, the lower is divided into two parts by a conical, depending process, called the uvula. From this, as from a common point of departure, two curved lines will be observed to extend on each side, one proceeding downwards and forwards, to the side of the tongue, the other backward to the pharynx, both being named, from their form, the arches of the palate. In the angular interval, left by their divergence, is lodged the ton- sil, ox amygdala; the anterior arch is also called the isthmus of the fauces, as it marks the narrowed interval between the mouth and the pharynx. The soft palate consists of five pairs of muscles, inclosed by the mucous membrane. 474. The levator palati is a long, flat muscle, which arises from the extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the cartilaginous part of the Eus- tachian tube. The two muscles converge, as they descend, to become blended with the other structures at the middle of the soft palate. 475. The circumflexus, or tensor palati, lies to the out- side of the preceding, and presents two portions, differing in direction and relations. The muscle arises from the small fossa (navicularis) at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, also from the anterior part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. From these points the muscle descends perpendicularly between the internal pterygoid muscle and the osseous lamella of the same name, and ends in a tendon, which winds round the hamular process; it then expands into a broad aponeurosis, which is attached to the border of the palate process, and to the aponeurosis of the corre- sponding muscle. 476. The azygos uvulce was so called, from its having

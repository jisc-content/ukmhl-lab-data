57 THE RIBS. lateral margins thin and oblique, present each an oblong de- pression, which receives the cartilage of the first rib. And at each inferior angle may be observed an articular half notch, which articulates with the second rib. The supe- rior border is hollowed, as has been already stated ; the in- ferior is straight, and united to the extremity of the second bone. The second piece, much longer than the first, is marked on its anterior surface by some transverse lines, which in- dicate its original division into separate portions. Both surfaces are depressed and nearly flat. The upper border is narrow, corresponding in breadth with the termination of the first bone, with which it is connected by cartilage. The lateral margins present each five notches for the recep- tion of the cartilages of the five lovrer true ribs, and a half notch superiorly, which with a similar depression in the first piece, forms a cavity for the second costal cartilage. The five inferior notches approach one another more closely, in proportion as they are situated lower down, and part of the last is occasionally made up by the ensiform car- tilage. The Ribs. 38. The ribs are situated between the sternum and ver- tebral column, and disposed in arches, so as to enclose the lateral parts of the thorax. They are twelve in number at each side, of which each of the seven superior ones, by means of a cartilaginous prolongation, which unites it to the sternum, completely encircles the thorax, on which ac- count they are thence called true ribs ; the remaining five being denominated false ribs, as they do not form com- plete circles. The length, breadth, and direction of these bones pre- sent several varieties. From the first to the eighth their length successively increases, whilst from the ninth, they

6 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 4. The external apparatus for collecting and concentrat- ing sound (external ear). After reviewing in this way the different parts of the organ successively, and after inspecting it as a whole, we may not inaptly compare it to an edifice consisting of seve- ral apartments, each fashioned after a particular manner, and intended for a distinct purpose. The external part may be likened to the portals of the edifice, at which the vi- sitors are collected previously to their entry, and after they have been there assembled and arranged, they are led across the ante-chamber by certain conductors stationed there for that purpose; by these the visitors are ushered into the presence-chamber, enclosed within the winding re- cesses of the labyrinth, and as they are successively intro- duced, they register on the tablet of the memory, their de- grees, their titles, and their properties. 5. The study of human anatomy has been especially pur- sued by the professors of the healing art, who, on just grounds, consider it as the most secure basis on which they can rest their investigations of the functions of the body in health, and of its derangements in diseases. Were anato- mists to confine their attention altogether to the human body, they would doubtless acquire a sufficiently accurate knowledge of the situation, form, connexions, and even composition of its different parts; but though an acquaint- ance with such details forms a necessary part of the pur- suit, it is far from constituting the final object to be aimed at. The natural or healthy actions of the body must be studied as a preliminary step to the knowledge of their morbid conditions ; the laws which preside over the for- mation and development of living beings must be fully in- vestigated before their functions can be rightly understood; and were we to restrict our views to the examination of any single species (even though it be the most perfect of all) our knowledge would be as inadequate,â€”our ideas of the laws of the economy would be as confined as those of

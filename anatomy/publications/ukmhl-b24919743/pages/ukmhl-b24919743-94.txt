The Bones of the Lower Extremity. 47. The lower extremity is made up of three parts; the thigh, leg, and foot. The osseous part of the first consists of one bone, the femur; that of the leg, of two, the tibia and fibula. The adjacent extremities of these, together with the patella, (a sort of sesamoid bone) form the knee. The foot is composed of three parts; the tarsus, meta^ tarsus, and phalanges. The Femur. 48. The femur is the longest bone in the skeleton; it presents a central part, or body, and two extremities. The body, compressed, but nearly cylindrical towards the centre, is expanded superiorly and inferiorly. Its ante- rior surface, convex and smooth, is necessarily broader to- * Tom. i. p. 743.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 176 the capsular ligament, the internal with the head of the femur. Its fibres are not continued all round; they rather pass obliquely from without inwards, over the margin of the cavity, one extremity being attached to the outer, the other to its inner surface. At the cotyloid notch these fibres are continued from side to side crossing one another, so as to render the circumference complete. Some additional fibres are superadded in this part, from which circumstance, as well as its being stretched across from one margin of the notch to the other, it is usually named the transverse liga- ment. Subjacent to the transverse portion, an interval is left for the admission of the articular vessels. 171. The inter-articular ligament (ligamentum teres ca- pitis femoris, Weit. Soemm.) is a thick dense fasciculus of fibres, implanted by one extremity which is round, into the fossa, in the head of the femur, by the other, where it is broad and bifid, into the margins of the cotyloid notch, where its fibres become blended with those of the trans- verse ligament. 172. The synovial membrane lines the contiguous sur- faces of all the parts which enter into the composition of the articulation, giving them a smooth and shining appear- ance. From the margin of the articular surface of the femur, it may be traced along the neck of that bone as far as the insertion of the capsular ligament, the inner surface of which it lines as far as its superior attachment. There it turns inwards over the cotyloid ligament, and dips into the cavity, lining its entire extent, and finally guided as it were, by the round ligament, (which it invests by a funnel-shaped process) it reaches the head of the femur, and invests it as far as the border of its cartilage, from whence we proceed- ed in tracing its reflexions.

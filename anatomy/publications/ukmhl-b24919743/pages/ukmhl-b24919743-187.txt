163 THE ELBOW JOINT. Of the Elboiv Joint. 129. The inferior extremity of the humerus, the ulna, and radius, are united at the elbow, so as to form a hinge joint. The sigmoid cavity of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus, so as to admit of flexion and extension only, while the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius, can turn freely on the rounded tuberosity to which it is applied. The bones are connected by four ligaments and a synovial membrane. 1. The internal lateral ligament, composed of diverging and radiated fibres, presents two parts, each with a differ- ent aspect, one looking forwards, the other backwards. The anterior part is attached above, where it is narrow and pointed, to the front of the internal condyle of the hume- rus ; its fibres, as they descend, become broad and ex- panded, and are inserted' into the coronoiâ€™d process, along the anterior margin of the sigmoid cavity. The posterior part of the same form (triangular) passes from the under and back part of the same process of bone, downwards to the inner border of the olecranon. The superior fibres extend transversely between these points, the rest become successively more and more oblique. 2. The external lateral ligament, shorter and much narrower than the internal, is attached superiorly to the external condyle of the humerus, and inferiorly becomes blended with the annular ligament of the radius; none of its fibres are prolonged to the surface of that bone, for if they were, they would check its rotatory motions. It is in- timately connected with the tendinous attachment of the extensor muscles, on which account when dissected, it pre- sents a jagged, irregular appearance. 3. The anterior ligament, is a broad thin membrane, placed in front of the joint, extending from the rough mar- gin of the fossa, which receives the coronoid process dur- ing flexion, downwards to the anterior border of the coro- m 2

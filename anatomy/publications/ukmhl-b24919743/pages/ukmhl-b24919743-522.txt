ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 480 arteries being the chief, whilst the occipital and temporal ramify on the cranium. This arrangement was first sug- gested by Bichat, and may be considered merely as an in- dication of his constant anxiety to make physiology the basis of his classifications. The subclavian Artery. The two vessels of this name differ in length, relations, and size, in which particulars they may be compared and contrasted as follows : 534. The right subcla- vian, having commenced at the division of the innomi- nata, behind the sterno-cla- vicular articulation, arches upwards and outwards to' reach the margin of the sca- lenus anticus. It there in- clines outwards and down- wards, beneath the clavicle and subclavius muscle, be- coming continuous with the axillary artery, at the lower border of the first rib. The vessel lies on a plane ante- rior to that of the left side, inasmuch as the innominata, from which it arises, is borne forwards by the trachea; and, in its course, it de- scribes a curve, whose con- vexity looks upwards, being in contact with the lower nerve of the brachial plexus, whilst its concavity looks The left subclavian artery arises from the transverse part of the aortic arch, at its most depending point, and thence ascends almost perpendicularly to get to a level with the first rib, lying close to the vertebrae, and supported by the longus colli. It is overlapped by the upper lobe of the lung, and the reflected part of the pleura, and crossed at its lower part by the nervus vagus (which had previously been parallel with it) and above, by the left vena in- nominata, which separates it from the sternum, and stei- no-thyroid and sterno-hyoid muscles. The artery lies parallel with, and close to the oesophagus. On reach- ing the margin of the first rib it turns suddenly out-

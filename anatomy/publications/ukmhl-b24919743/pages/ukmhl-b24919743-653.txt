MEDULLA OBLONGATA—CORPORA OLIVARIA. G09 which is situated between the corpus olivare and resti- forme. This consists of a narrow line of white matter, which may be traced along the medulla oblongata, and from thence downwards between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. It is but slightly marked in the lower part of its extent, but becomes more perceptible opposite the corpus olivare; after which it narrows, and ceases altogether at the margin of the pons, “ not being continued upwards into the cerebral mass.” This may be termed tractus respiratorius, as it gives origin to the class of respiratory nerves as established by Mr. Bell. A transverse section of the medulla shews it to consist of a thin lamella of white matter, inclosing the grey or cine- ritious substance. The latter presents two lateral portions, each of a crescentic form, their concavities looking out- wards ; the convex sides of each are turned towards the middle line, and are connected by a short transverse fasci- culus of grey matter. The anterior cornua of the lateral masses are rather thick and rounded ; the posterior extend as far as the corresponding collateral sulci. 651. The corpora olivaria, when stripped of their medul- lary lamella, are found to consist each of an oblong mass of grey matter, surrounded by a fringed or scalloped border, and attached towards the middle line by a slight petiole. Owing to this arrangement, it presents, when divided by a transverse section, an arborescent appearance. 652. The corpora pyramidalia are separated only by the anterior sulcus, and extend, inclosed between the corpora olivaria, from the margin of the pons to the foramen mag- num. Those fibres of each pyramid which are close to the sulcus, pass across it obliquely, and so a decussation is produced between them. The rest continue their course uninterruptedly, so that only a part of the pyramids change place, or decussate. 653. The corpora restiformia (pyramides posterieures, 2 R

99 THE METACARPUS. feriorly, with the second metacarpal bone; on the ulnar side, with the os magnum; on the radial side, with the tra- pezium ; the anterior and posterior surfaces afford attach- ment to ligaments. Os Magnum. 70. This is the largest of the carpal bones; its form is oblong, round superiorly, cubic inferiorly; the superior surface, named its head, is supported by a narrowed por- tion, named the neck ; its greatest convexity is in the antero- posterior direction, where it is received into a cavity formed by the scapho'ides and semilunare ; it articulates, inferiorly, by three distinct surfaces, of which the middle is the largest, with the second, third and fourth metacarpal bones; on the ulnar side, with the os unciforme; on the radial side, with the os trapezoides ; anteriorly and posteriorly it affords attachment to ligaments. Os Unciforme. 71. Articulates, superiorly, with the os semi-lunare; infe- riorly, by two distinct surfaces, with the fourth and fifth me- tacarpal bones; on the ulnar side, with the os cune'xforme ; on the radial side, with the os magnum; anteriorly it pre- sents a slightly crooked process, (whence its name) which affords attachment to the anterior annular ligament of the carpus; posteriorly it gives attachment to ligaments. The Metacarpus. 72. Forms the second, or middle portion of the hand, being situated between the carpus and phalanges; it is com- posed of five bones, which are designated in their numeri- cal order, the enumeration being commenced at the radial side. These bones are placed parallel one with the other, and nearly on the same plane, with the exception of the first, which is more anterior than the rest, and alters its re- lative position to them in its various movements. They vary h 2

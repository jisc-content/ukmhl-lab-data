ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY, 262 munis. In its progress the following branches pass off from the dorsal artery: a. The tarsal branch (arteria tarsea) inclines outwards, lying close to the tarsal bones, and covered by the extensor brevis. Op- posite the head of the fibula it communicates with the posterior fibular and external malleolar arteries, after which it continues onwards beneath the peroneus brevis, to the external border of the foot, where its final ramifications terminate: b, the metatarsal branch, so called from its being placed over the heads of the meta- tarsal bones, arises from the dorsal artery, as it is about to sink into the interosseous space, and thence arches outwards under cover of the extensor tendons, and terminates at the external bor- der of the foot. From the arch small branches pass off to sup- ply the surrounding structures; but from its convexity, which is turned forwards, three branches proceed along the interosseous spaces, supply the muscles which fill them, inosculate with the perforating arteries from the plantar arch, and finally, on reaching the cleft between the toes, divide into two small branches which supply the contiguous borders of the lesser toes. This artery pre- sents many varieties in its size as well as in the number of its branches ; sometimes the interosseae are derived from the tarsal artery : c, when about to pass down into the sole of the foot, the dorsal artery sends forwards, on the first metatarsal bone, a branch (dorsalis hallucis) which when it arrives at the fissure between the first and second toes, divides into two branches for the contiguous borders of the two first toes: d, the communicating branch, (arte- ria communicans) or rather the termination of the dorsal artery, passes between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle into the sole of the foot, where it inclines outwards and inosculates with the plantar arch. From their point of union a considerable vessel is sent onwards along the first metatarsal space, which, when it reaches the digital extremity of the two first metatar- sal bones, divides into branches, which diverge as they apply themselves to the adjacent borders of the phalanges of the two first toes. Dissection and operations.â€”When describing the method of ex- posing the popliteal artery, it was stated that this could be effect- ed by merely dividing the inner head of the gastrocnemius, and

(J82 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. tegumentary membranes, are placed the fibres of the orbi- cular muscle in both lids, and those of the levator palpebra? in the upper one, together with the tarsi, and along the margins of the lids the eye-lashes. 721. The tarsi are two thin lamellae of fibro-cartilage, placed one in each lid : the lower cartilage is narrow, elongated, and nearly of equal breadth from side to side; that of the upper lid is broad at the middle, but narrows to a point at the lateral margins. The ciliary, or contiguous, margins of the tarsi are rather thick, and covered by the conjunctiva, where it is being continuous with the exter- nal tegument, but the opposite margins are thin and at- tached to the orbit through the medium of a thin cellulo-fibrous lamella, prolonged obliquely to its border. Along the margin of each lid two or more rows of hairs are set {cilia, or eye-lashes), those of the upper lid being the longer. Between the conjunctiva and the tarsal car- tilages the sebaceous follicles of the lids are placed, which are known as the glands of Meibomius: they are more numerous in the upper than in the lower lid, being disposed in rows that run vertically, or, in other words, transversely with regard to the direction of the cartilages: they produce a viscid secretion, which concretes after death, and can be squeezed out of the foramina of the follicles. 722. The lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland and its ducts, the lachrymal sack, the puucta lachry- malia, the caruncula, and the nasal duct. The lachrymal gland is placed at the superior, external, and anterior part of the orbit, being close behind the external orbital process of the frontal bone. Its forms is oval, being at the same time convex on its orbital surface, where it is received, into a slight depression, in the roof of the orbit; and con- cave on the ocular aspect, where it rests on the globe and the external rectus muscle. It consists of two lobes of

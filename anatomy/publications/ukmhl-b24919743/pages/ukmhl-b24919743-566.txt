ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 521 structures here referred to as enclosing the urethra are the prostate gland, the bulb, corpus spongiosum, and glans penis. 581. The prostate gland has been compared to a trun- cated cone, compressed from above downwards. It more nearly resembles a chesnut, and will be found to enclose part of the neck of the bladder, and the commencement of the urethra, at their junction. The tube, however, is so placed, as that two-thirds of the substance of the gland lies beneath it. The prostate consists of two lateral masses or lobes of equal size, the third being behind and between them. The posterior margin is notched in the middle, and if the vesiculae be turned forwards, the third lobe, forming a small rounded body, will be found inserted be- tween the two lateral ones, and connected intimately with them. 582. About an inch, or a little less, from the anterior margin of the prostate, the urethra comes into contact with what is called the “ bulb," which is succeeded by a prolongation, similar in structure, named corpus spongiosum, and the latter finally expands into the glans penis; so that the canal is invested for three-fourths of its length by a vascular net-work, which, by being differently disposed in different parts, has received the names just mentioned. It consists of a minute interlacement of capillary vessels, con- nected together by cellular membrane, capable of receiving a considerable quantity of blood, and thereby assuming that state of tension which attends the venereal orgasm. Hence it has been termed “ erectile tissue.” The bulb is thick, and pendent from the under surface of the canal; the spongy part surrounds it, but exists also in greater quantity along its lower aspect, whilst the glans forms a conical prominence, slightly compressed from before back- wards, presenting at its summit a vertical fissure, marking the termination of the urethra (meatus urinarius), and bounded at its base by an oblique line. Behind this line is

ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. D The long or fhort in the carcafe. A horfe which is fhort in the carcafe, is ufually ribbed home, as it is termed, that is to fay, there exifts but a fmall fpace between the laft rib and the hip bone. This conformation is jnfhly efteemed excellent. A horfe thus formed is generally fhort in the back and wide in his loins, and better adapted to carry weight and bear fatigue than a horfe of a different form. . H orses of this defcription, however, are com- monly fuppofed to be deficient in fpeed, from the idea that they have not fufficient length. But when it is confidered that the carcafe has no mo- tion of itfelf, but is entirely aÂ£ted upon by the quarters and extremities, it is manifeft that the length fhould exiff in thefe parts, and not in the body. In proof of this, two horfes may be found exafclly of the fame length from the point of the fhoulder, at the cheff, to the point of the buttock, and yet one horfe fhall be long in the carcafe, and the other fhort.

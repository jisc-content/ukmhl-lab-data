ON PROGRESSION* The 190 two motions in the trot, as he does in the walk with four. But as in the trot he is fupported by two legs only, he is more liable to fall in that pace than in either the walk or the canter, in both of which he has always three legs on the ground at the fame period. The trot, particularly in the circle, is well adapted to give freedom and elafticity of mo- tion to a young horfe, and to confirm him in his center of gravity. In performing this leffon, the outfide legs work on a larger circle than thofe on the infide ; he is confequently obliged to advance the outfide {boulder as much as poffible, to keep pace with the infide fhoulder, which moves on a fmaller extent of ground. The fame thing takes place alfo in the outward hind leg, for the fame reafon. In working a horfe in the circle, it is cuftomary to rein him up tight, fo as to confine his head to one particular pofition ; but this praÂ£tice tends very much to confine him in his fhoulders, and thereby to defeat the intention of the leffon.

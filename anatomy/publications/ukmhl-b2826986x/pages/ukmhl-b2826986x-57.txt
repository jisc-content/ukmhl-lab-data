ON THE EYE. eye enables him, in fome degree, to fee behind him, and to kick againft an adverfary with greater cer- tainty. The anatomy of the horfe’s eye varies, in fome in dances, from the human eye, although the functions are precifely the fame. The pupil of the human eye is circular in its form, that of the horfe oblong. By this formation, the horfe’s eye takes in objects horizontally to a much greater extent than the human. The mufcles which move the horfe’s eye, are feven in number; in the human eye there are but fix. The feventh feems to be adapted for the purpofe of retracting the eye within the orbit, to fhield it from injury, and alfo to fufpend it in the action of grazing. It differs alfo from the human eye by being furnifhed with a membrane, fituated at the anterior corner (vide pi. 7, l. c). This mem- brane is common to molt quadrupeds*, as well as to birds. The anatomical name for this membrane * The monkey is an exception to this rule. IS

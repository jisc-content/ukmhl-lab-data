Whenever this confufion occurs, he fhould be checked inftantly, for this compound motion both reduces his fpeed, and renders him more unfafe in his going. If, from an upright fhoulder or bad pofition of the fore leg, the horfe goes heavily before, he will be liable to flrike his fore feet with the toes of his hind feet, and produce a difagree- able noife, called Forging.

IO ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. on the union of the neck with the fhoulders. The neck fhould ifTue high, and nearly in a line with the withers, and its lower part fhould enter the cheft high, and above the point of the fhoulders: the oppofite conformation to this produces what is termed an ewe neck, which can never be efteemed handfome. The fhoulders conflitute the center of motion in the fore part of the body, and the extent and elafticity of that motion will depend chiefly on the pofition of the fhoulder blades. The con- nexion of the fhoulder blades with the body is eflablifhed by mufcles only, independently of any joint whatever. It is by the alternate contra&ion and extenfion of thefe different mufcles that motion is produced, and it is by their united elafticity that the fhock is broken when in a&ion. This would not have been the cafe, had the fhoulder terminated in a fixed joint. The truth of this remark may be afcertained by riding alternately on

Therefore proprietors of waggons and ftage coaches generally experience the greateft Ioffes when the roads are bad, and the labour much increafed. As the foregoing evils are in a great meafure the refult of a want of regulation in the diet of the O animal, it remains to point out the plan neceffary to be purfued in this refpe£t. The common prac- tice is to feed all horfes in the fame proportion, without regard either to the labour they perform, or to their ages and conftitutions. The impro- priety of this pra£tice mufl be fufficiently evident, and it is, without doubt, the bafts of many difeafes.

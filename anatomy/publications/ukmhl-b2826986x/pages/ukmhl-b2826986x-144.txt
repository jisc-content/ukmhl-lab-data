118 ON RESPIRATION, the ribs and diaphragm. Hence it is probable, that adhefions of the lungs to the ribs are not fo injurious to refpiration as might be imagined. If the cheft is punÂ£tured in the dead fubjeft, the external air rufhes in, and the lungs collapfe; but if the horfe was broken-winded, the lungs do not collapfe, which proves that they have loft their elafticity. This ftate of the lungs fufticiently accounts for the difficulty of refpiration, for, as their faculty of dilatation is deftroyed, the ribs cannot expand without forming a vacuum in the cheft, which the preflure of the external atmofphere prevents, which may be readily perceived in the cafe of broken wind, for then the intercoftal mufcles are fo ftrongly retraced, as to form a deep furrow between every rib, as well as a depreflion in the flanks. On this account, air is received into the lungs with great difficulty, but its expulfion is not fo difficult, as the return of the ribs and diaphragm naturally force it out by their preflure. Thus, in broken-winded horfes, infpiration is very flow, but expira-

As the horfe recovers his center in a ftraight line of progreffion, by advancing one leg beyond the other, fo will he recover his center in a lateral progreffion, by eroding one leg beyond the other. Thus, if the horfe moves ddeways to the right, he erodes over his left fore and hind legs beyond the right fore and hind legs at the fame period, and thereby recovers his perpendicular pofition.

ON PROGRESSION. 185 B B The In fig. 1, the horfe has advanced the near* fore leg (A) and placed it again on the ground ; this aÂ£lion being completed, the off hind leg (C) is ele- vated and advanced under the body, but before it reaches the ground, the off fore leg (B) is railed and advanced, in order to make room for it, as is par- ticularly the cafe when the horfe overfteps the print of the fore foot with his hind foot. When the off hind leg (C) has reached the ground (vide Jig. 2) the horfe hands upon three legs, forming a triangle (A, C, D). When the off fore leg (B) alights on the ground, the near hind leg (D) com- mences its a6tion, and is advanced in the fame man- ner as before, and the horfe is again fupported by three legs (A, B, C). Thus the animal, during the walk, is always fupported by a triangular pofition of three legs, namely, two fore legs and one hind leg, or one fore leg and two hind legs, alternately. * The near legs are thofe on the fame fide on which the rider mounts.

57 ON SHOEING. A corn is generally produced by a partial preflure of the fhoe, from its fitting too hollow, or by the fhoe being too fhort, and indenting itfelf into the heel. The blood being forced into the horny fibres of the hoof, gives it fometimes a red, and fome- times a black appearance. The concomitant inflammation is frequently fo great, as to caufe internal fuppuration of the laminated furface of the hoof, even up to the coronet. In this cafe the corn fhould be properly laid open with a drawing knife, to procure a free egrefs for the matter downwards, and a bar fhoe fhould be applied, in order to remove the preflure from the heel unto the frog. As foon as the in- jured part is healed, the beft and moft radical mode of cure will be to harden its furface by an equal preflure, which will be beft effe£ted by the horfe’s remaining fome weeks without fhoes. i DISEASED

CHAPTER XL On PROGRESSION, The fucceffive alternation of the limbs in the motion of quadrupeds is fo tranfitory, as to render it very difficult to difcern, at the fame view, their aCtion feparately and collectively. The horfe may be confidered as a machine fupported by four per- pendicular columns, each of which has its own center of gravity ; but during progreffion, each of thefe columns muft fhift its center, and obtain a new bafis fucceffively.

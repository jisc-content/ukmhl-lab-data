200 ON PROGRESSION. THE GALLOP Is commonly divided into the hand gallop and the full gallop; but as this didin&ion applies more to the different degrees of velocity than to any peculiarity in the pace, it will be nnneceffary to enter into a feparate defcription. In the gallop, the horfe leads with one fore leg fomewhat ad- vanced beyond the other, but not fo much fo as in the canter (Jig. 1) and when he is going at his utmod fpeed, the legs are nearly equal (Jig. 2). The fleeted gallopers carry their bodies perfectly horizontal, or, in other words, bear the lead refem- blance in their motion to that of a rocking-horfe. For, in the aÂ£tion of progredion, it will be found that all bodies will be retarded in their pro- grefs in proportion as they depart from a right line, either horizontally or perpendicularly. None but horfes of great powers are able to gallop in this form, for to fupply the want of undulation in the body,

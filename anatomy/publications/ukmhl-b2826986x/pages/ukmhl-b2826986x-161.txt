ON THE STABLE. >35 From what has been faid, it appears that the heat thus produced by the animal is expended upon heating the air which comes in contaft with him; whence arifes that fpecies of warmth which is generally met with in a clofe or confined liable, and upon this ground very erroneous conclufions have been formed; for it is generally fuppofed that this artificial temperature increafes the warmth of the animal, and meafures are confequently adopted to fupport it, by excluding the external air as much as polfible. Flannel applied to the Ikin prevents animal heat from evaporating fo quickly as it does when the body is expofed without cover- ing, and thus the furface of the body will be confiderably warmer. Yet the warmth does not exill in the flannel, but in the body which it covers; for the temperatures of ice, and metals when cold, are not increafed by being enveloped in flannel, although heated bodies thereby retain their heat much longer; but thefe ultimately become cold, unlefs the original generating caufe of heat is continued to be applied. In the fame manner, therefore,

38 ON THE EYE. The The mode of treatment here recommended will, in general, remove the inflammation, but will not prevent its return, except proper attention is paid to the management of the animal. It is certain that this difeafe arifes moft frequently amongfl horfes which are highly fed, and not fufhciently exercifed, and, in proof of this fa£t, many inftances occur where horfes have recovered perfect fight and retained it, in confequence of regular labour in a mail coach or poll chaife. There is another defcription of imperfeCt eyes, commonly called Moon Eyes or Buck Eyes. This term originated probably from fome peculiar in- fluence which the moon was fuppofed to have upon them, as the inflammatory attacks are gene- rally periodical. In this difeafe the eye is ufually fmaller than the common fize, and its outward appearance is cloudy and of a greyifh colour. The animal alfo is much addi£ted to ffarting at objects, particularly at fhadows and reflections from water.

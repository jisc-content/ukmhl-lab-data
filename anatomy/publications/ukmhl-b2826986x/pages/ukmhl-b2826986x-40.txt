If the foot turns either inwards or outwards, it cannot alight flat on the ground, in which cafe the pofition can never be firm and heady, becaufe the prefifure will be partial on either the inward or outward quarter of the foot. If the leg is not perfectly ftraight from the fhoulder to the foot (vide plate 3, Jig. 1) its adtion cannot be true, nor the center of gravity fo readily found, as by one that is even and uniform in all its parts (jig, 2). If the elbow inclines inwards clofe to the ribs (jig. 1, A A) the leg muff be thrown fide ways when in a6tion, which will remove the foot too far from the center of gravity, and produce a lateral rolling motion very unpleafant to the rider.

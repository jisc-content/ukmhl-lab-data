Videfg. 1, L A A, fame plate. Ho rses of this defeription have, in general, the reputation of fpeed ; but not altogether with juflice. In this pofition of the leg, a greater portion of weight muff; be thrown on the hough than if it was upright. Moreover, it is clear, that a moving part muff be impeded in its aÂ£lion in proportion as it is oppreffed, and this oppreffion is fufficiently mani- feft by the production of thorough pins, curbs, fpavins, and weaknefs in the fetlock joint, com- monly called knuckling over; injuries to which horfes of this mould are peculiarly fubjeCI. The foregoing remarks upon the external con- formation, apply only to the mechanical advantages to be derived from a peculiar conftruClion of the component parts. The force of the mufcles not being

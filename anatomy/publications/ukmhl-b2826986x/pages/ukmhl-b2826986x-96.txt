THE GREASE. 70 the In the winter feafon, at which period the greafe is moft prevalent, the infenfible perfpira- tion of the body is not fo regular, nor fo profufe, as in the fummer; but nature generally provides againft this decreafe, by increafing the difcharge of urine, and the expiration of vapour from the lungs ; and this mode of expulfion would be fully fufficient for the purpofes of the animal oeconomy, if the horfe remained in a ftate of na- ture. But it is far different with him in a domef- ticated ftate, in which he is alternately expofed to a warm and cold atmofphere, as he is within or without the ftable. The fecretion and evacua- tion of urine is difturbed in its procefs, by forcing him to proceed in his labour at the moment when the fulnefs of the bladder ftimulates him to dif- charge its contents; and although the perfpiration may be increafed to an exceffive degree by exer- cife, and which might be fuppofed to compenfate for deficiencies in other refpeÂ£ts, yet it will be found, that the refult of exceffive labour and per- fpiration will be a proportionate debility, whereas

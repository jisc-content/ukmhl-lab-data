ON RESPIRATION. 115 In other refpe£ts, the organs of refpiration differ but little from thofe of the human being, except that the diaphragm is much more mufcular, and fituated more obliquely, by which means the ftomach lies below it, although the body is in an horizontal pofition. This inclination of the dia- phragm renders the refiftance of the ftomach and inteftines lefs powerful than if it were placed in a more perpendicular dire&ion. When the lungs collapfe, this diaphragm is flackened, but in the a£t of infpiration it is tightened fo as to force back the contents of the abdomen, by which means the capacity of the cheft is enlarged. This is per- formed partly by its own mufcular contra6lion, and partly by the expanfion of the ribs, whereby the lateral points from whence the diaphragm takes its origin, are removed farther from each other. This being the natural procefs of refpiration, it will not be difficult to conceive how much it muft be impeded when the faddle is girthed ex- tremely tight, or too far back towards the flank; Q 2 but

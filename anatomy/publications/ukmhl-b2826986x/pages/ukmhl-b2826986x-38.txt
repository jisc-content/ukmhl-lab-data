ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. 12 two different fcapulse poffefs the fame degree of extenfion, the one fituated obliquely (vide plate 2, fig. 1) the other perpendicularly (fig. 2) it muff neceffarily follow, that, afting on their refpe&ive centers, the one which is oblique muff elevate its lower extremity higher than that which is per- pendicular, and confequently will increafe the projeÂ£tion of every part of the fore limb. Hence it appears, that an oblique pofition of the fhoulder is moft favourable for progreffion. The fhoulder may want liberty either by being too flefhy or too lean. In the firft inftance it is overloaded, and in the lad, it poffeffes not mufcle fufficient to enable it to perform its fun&ions with ftrength and celerity. The mufcles of the cheft contribute greatly to the motion of the lower part of the fhoulder. Hence a ftrong and moderately full cheft, is to be preferred to one that is narrow and meagre. It will probably be urged, that horfes are fometimes poffeffed

ON THE STABLE. *33 For this purpofe, it will firft be requifite to defcribe the fource from whence animal heat is produced, and maintained in a degree fufficient for the fupport of life. This fource is atmofpherical air, and the mode whereby it is applied to the vital organs of animal bodies is by refpiration. A certain part of this air combines with the blood in the lungs, and by fome chemical a<5tion, not yet thoroughly underltood, furnifhes heat to the whole frame. But, as in this climate the heat of the animal is greater than that of the air by which he is furrounded, it follows, from the known laws of heated bodies, that there is a conftant emiffion of heat from the horfe, which is abforbed by and warms the cooler air with which he is in contaÂ£t. Along with the heat, a quantity of moifture conftantiy efcapes from the pores of the {kin, which, when the animal is at reif, and not kept too clofe, is in- fenfible to our organs ; but when he is put into violent motion, or kept too hot, it becomes fenfible in the form of fweat, or of {teams ilfuing from his fkin.

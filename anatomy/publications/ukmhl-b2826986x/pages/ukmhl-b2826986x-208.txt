The method which is generally adopted to improve the breed of any particular fpecies, is by crofling them with thofe of a better kind ; but if the ratio of improvement can be reduced to mathematical calculation, it is evident that the offspring from fuch an union, although it may be fu- perior to the worft of the two parents, yet will be inferior to the belt, if, as we are taught to believe, it partakes of the qualities of them both. Thus the produce from a blood horfe and a cart mare, will be a hetero- geneous monfler, inferior to either of its progenitors; and the fame refult will enfue from all crolfes which are very remote from each other in their individual properties. It would feem, therefore, that the beft way of improving the breed, would be to feleft the likelieft individuals of the fame blood, and to propagate from them only. CHAPTER

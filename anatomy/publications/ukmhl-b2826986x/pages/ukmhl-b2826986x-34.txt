ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. The The horfeâ€™s fenfe of hearing is very acute, and it is a fa6t pretty well known by fportfmen, that he can hear the cry of the hounds at a greater diflance than his rider. Hence it will fcarcely be neceffary to point out the abfurdity of cropping ; yet there exifls another bad cuftom, nearly as in- jurious as the former, viz. trimming the hair clofe out of the ears. The utility of hair in that part confifls in moderating found, excluding cold air, rain and flies, and other extraneous fubffances, which might otherwife drop into the ear*. The method of trimming the ears is by fmgeing the hair with a candle, and as the ear itfelf is frequently injured and rendered fore by this procefs, the horfe in confequence becomes fhy of any thing approach- ing his head. * The ears of all animals are defended in fome peculiar manner. The mole which lives under ground, and whofe ear is conftantly expofed to the ingrefs of earthy particles, has the faculty of clofmg that orifice by means of a fpbincter mufcle. The human ear alfo fecretes a fluid, which, being waxy and cobefive, arrefts the progrefs of infe&s and duft, and prevents their entrance.

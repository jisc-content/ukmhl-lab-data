ON LAMENESS. 85 STIFF JOINT, or ANCHYLOSIS, Is mo ft commonly the confequence of wounds through the capfular ligament of the joint. When the capfular ligament is perforated by any acci- dental injury, the fynovia or fluid, which is fecreted for the purpofe of lubricating the heads of the bones in their a£fion with each other, efcapes out- wards. Great irritation and inflammation attend this ftate of the wound, probably from the a£tion of the atmofpheric air which enters it. If the capfular ligament is not fpeedily healed, or its divided edges brought into conta6l with each other, fo as to prevent the fynovia from continuing to flow through the orifice, the membranes begin to thicken, and bony matter is thrown out from the heads of the bones, which unites them into one folid mafs, and the ufe of the joint is irrecoverablv loft.

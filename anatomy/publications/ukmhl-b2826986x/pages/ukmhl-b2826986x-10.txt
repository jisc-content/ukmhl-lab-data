PREFACE. vm Con- tributor to our pleafures and comforts, when af- fli6ted with fome violent difeafe in which nature exerts her utmoft efforts to relieve herfelf; but how muff this fcene of diflrefs be heightened, could the proprietor be convinced, that the very men he applies to for affiftance only aggravate the evil by their ignorance. The mod learned and experienced phyficians confefs the infufhciency of their art, and confe- quently their attention is dire6led to the means of rendering it lefs fallible. To men of this descrip- tion, the infinite varieties which the fame difeafe prefents in different habits, will fufficiently de- monftrate the difficulties attending their pra6tice ; but the empyric, whofe confidence ever keeps pace with his want of {kill, boldly prefcribes the fame treatment under every difference of age, fex, and conftitution.

ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. 27 arife both from the inward furface of the hoof, and the furface of the bone (vide jig. 4). Thefe laminae maintain their connexion with each other by the attra&ion of cohefion ; they alfo contain innumerable ramifications of blood vefiels and nerves. The compofition of this part is fingularly beautiful; for if the coffin bone and hoof were not feparate from each other, the growth of the hoof downwards could not have been carried on inde- pendently of the parts contained within it; thus we find the connexion exifts by the attraÂ£lion of thefe laminae to each other, and which are folded together like a fan, in order to occupy lefs fpace, and yet, if expanded, would furnifh a furface twenty times the circumference of the foot.

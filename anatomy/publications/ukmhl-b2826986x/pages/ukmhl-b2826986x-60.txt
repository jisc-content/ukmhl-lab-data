ON THE EYE. 34 The cryftalline lens is a pellucid tranfparent convex body, fituated immediately behind the pupil*. It frequently becomes opaque, in confe- quence of general inflammation in the globe of the eye. In this ftate the furface of the lens, which prefents itfelf in the cavity of the pupil, affumes a greyifh afpe£t, and in the confirmed ftate it becomes perfectly white. At the commencement of this difeafe, fmall grey fpecks, about the fize of a pin’s head, are fometimes perceived in the pupil, fo fmall as not to interrupt the entrance of light; but the prefence of thefe fpecks is a certain indication that the eyes have been attacked at fome former period [vide pi. 7, L D). The appearance of the eye in an in- flamed ftate, whether from external injury or from a bad habit of body, is nearly the fame. The fur- face becomes cloudy and opaque, and frequently * The cryftalline lens is more or lefs convex in different animals. In fiffi it is perfeftly fpherical, as the aqueous medium which furrounds them, renders a greater refraftion of the rays neceffary to vifion.

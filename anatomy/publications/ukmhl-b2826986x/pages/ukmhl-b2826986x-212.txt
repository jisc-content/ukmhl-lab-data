The walk is, of all paces, the eafieft to the rider, provided he fits on the center of the horfeâ€™s back, as it confifls of an alternate depreffion of the fore and hind quarters; for infiance, when either of the fore legs is advanced, the fore quarters muff fink; but when the leg, by the advancement of the body, reaffumes its perpendicular pofition, the fore quarters will recover their former altitude. The fame action takes place in the hinder quarters. This motion may be compared to the vibration of the beam of a pair of fcales. The walk fhould be light, firm, and quick. The knee fhould be bent moderately, and the leg appear to be fufpended in the air for an inffant; the foot alfo fhould alight perfectly flat on the ground. But to be capable of a free unembarraffed walk, it is neceffary that the horfe fhould be well fhaped in his fore quarters and legs ; for a quadruped that is not firm on his center of gravity when he is handing ffill, can never be firm during progreffion. It will therefore be expedient to recapitulate fome remarks on the external con- formation contained in the former part of this work,

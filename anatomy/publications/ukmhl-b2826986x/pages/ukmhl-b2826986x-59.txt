33 ON THE EYE. F The an obfcure light. Letter B, in a ftrong light. The non-enjoyment of this faculty is a certain indica- tion of blindnefs. To examine a horfe’s eyes pro- perly, he fhould be placed under a liable door, with his head facing the light. In this fituation the pupils of both eyes fhould be exaftly of the fame dimenfions. As he advances more into the light, the pupils fhould contract; but if either of them does not contraft, the horfe is certainly blind of that eye. The difeafe which occafions this fpecies of blindnefs is termed, in pathology, the Gutta ferena, and arifes from a palfy in the optic nerve. It is fo little perceptible, that few but anatomills can de- te£t it. Another caufe preventing the imprelfion of light on the optic nerve, is more perceptible, but equally incurable, viz. an opacity in the furface of the cryllalline lens through which the rays of light pafs to the retina.

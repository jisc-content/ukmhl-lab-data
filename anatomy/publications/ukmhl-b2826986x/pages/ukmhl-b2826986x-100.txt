Other membrane- ous parts, fuch as the noftrils and the eyes, are fhielded, with the fame intention, by peculiar fecreted fluids, which in a flate of health conftantly cover their furfaces. The inward furface of the noftrils is kept moift, in order to preferve the fenfe of fmelling ; and the outward furface of the eye is kept moift, in order to preferve its tranfparency. Both of thefe faculties would be deftroyed by the conta6f of atmofpheric air, which, by drying the furface of the noftril, would render it incapable of fmelling; and which alfo, by drying the furface of the eye, would corrugate it, and render it opaque by the multiplicity of refra&ions which would arife from its irregularity. As the body is thus defended with hair, it ac- cordingly follows that thofe parts which would, if they were naked, be moft expofed to water and dirt, are furnifhed with a greater portion of this covering.

ON THE EYE. 35 a yellowifh red, and fometimes green fluid is feen floating in the anterior chamber of the eye. The opacity of the outward furface is produced by the coagulable lymph being forced between the laminae of the tranfparent cornea, but is generally miflaken for a film covering the outward part of the eye ; hence the pernicious cuflom of blowing powdered glafs, and other irritating applications, into the eye, is reforted to with a view of eroding it. The blood veffels of the tunica conjunÂ£tiva, or white of the eye, are turgid during inflammation. In this ftate the light is painful, and, in order to prevent its entrance, the eye-lids are generally clofed. When the eye-lids are opened by the hand to examine the ftate of the eye, the membrana ni&itans or hawe is brought, by the animal, con- fiderably over the furface of the eye, to fupply momentarily the office of the eye-lids, in prevent- ing the accefs of light.

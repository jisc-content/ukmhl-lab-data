For in every cafe where I have had opportunities of examining horfes which have died of the flag- gers, I have uniformly found the ftomach diflended with a large quantity of dry undigefted food. But as it may appear extraordinary that this fhould occur to many horfes in the fame liable, it will be necelfary to aflign fome additional data to llrengthen this theory. The following are the moll promi- nent : If a carrier, or a proprietor of poll-horfes, lofes a horfe in this way, it mull follow, that if he is not immediately replaced by another horfe, the rell mull have their labour proportionably in- creafed.

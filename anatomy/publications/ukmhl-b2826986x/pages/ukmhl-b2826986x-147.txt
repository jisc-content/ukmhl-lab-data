ON RESPIRATION. I 2 I With regard to water in the cheft, it is fre- quently problematical, on examination of the dead fubjeCt, whether the extravafation took place before or after death. Another imperfection which may be included in the clafs of difeafed refpiration, is the found which arifes in breathing, with fome horfes, when their pace is accelerated. A horfe of this defcrip- tion is termed a Roarer. From my own obferva- tion, I have not been able to difcover whether its fource is in the lungs, the trachea, or the nofe, though it is probable its feat is in the trachea or larynx. Dealers have a method of ascertaining the exigence of the difeafe by {hiking the horfe under the belly with a whip, and turning him Suddenly round at the fame time. If he groans during this procefs, they fay it proves that he is a roarer. This is probably occafioned by the fudden contraction of the abdominal mufcles forcing air from the lungs through the trachea with greater rapidity, in con- fequence of the pain he feels from the ftroke of the r whip.

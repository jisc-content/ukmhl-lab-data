ON LAMENESS. 9* conttitute a rapture of the tendon or back fmews. When the fufpenfor ligaments are ruptured, the fetlock joint is incapable of preferving its natural oblique pofition, on which account it becomes fo horizontal as nearly to touch the ground. But as the flexor mufcles flill poffefs the power of bending the leg (which they could not do if the tendons were ruptured) it is manifeft that the ligaments, whofe office it is to maintain the proper pofition and connexion of the fhank and pattern bones, are alone the parts affedled. A perfedt recovery is feldom obtained, from the impradficability of con- fining the limb in a manner that would be mott favourable to a re-union of the divided parts. A fhoe with a high heel, and a bandage round the leg, are the mott likely means of promoting a cure* The re-union of the ligament, however, does not reftore the original pofition of the leg, the horfe, therefore, decreafes much in value.

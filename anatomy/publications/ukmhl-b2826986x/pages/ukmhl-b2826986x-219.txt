ON PROGRESSION. 19 3 appearance, as the figure of a rider Twinging his , arms and legs backwards and forwards as if they did not belong to his body. Fig. 1, plate 14, reprefents the horfe in a mo- derate trot, in which pace he covers no more ground at each motion than extends from one hind leg to the other. Vide letters D, C. But in fig. 2, where the trot is accelerated, he not only covers more ground by the greater ex- tenfion of his legs, but gains alfo an additional fpace by the momentum of his body during the period when all his legs are in the air. Thus the letter C marks the fpot which the near hind foot occupied before it was raifed in the air, and the letters A, B, deferibe the fpots of ground to which the near fore foot and off hind foot will reach when they alight on the earth. This momentum is, in a great meafure, loft, when the horfe goes in harnefs, as the vis inertiae of the carriage is fufficient to counterbalance it. c c When

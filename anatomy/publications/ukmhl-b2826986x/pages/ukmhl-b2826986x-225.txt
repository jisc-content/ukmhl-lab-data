199 ON PROGRESSION. THE leads with the off or right fore leg, becaufe the rider holding the reins in the left hand, generally turns his body fomewhat to the fame fide, which inclination accords alfo with the oblique direction of the horfe’s body. To oblige the horfe to lead with the off fore leg, it will be neceffary to fhorten the near or left hand rein, and to prefs the horfe’s fide with the left leg, and to apply the fpur, if neceffary. By fhortening the left rein, his head and neck will be inclined to the left or near fide, which will confine the motion of his near or left fhoulder, and force him to advance the off fhoul- der, at the fame time the preffure of the rider’s left leg throws off the croupe to the right fide, and gives the hind quarters the fame direction as the fore quarters. If the horfe is required to lead with his near or left leg, the right hand and heel muff be employed for that purpofe.

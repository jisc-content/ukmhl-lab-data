ON THE STABLE. *3$ therefore, the heat which flies off from the body of the horfe when in a clofe liable, certainly ren- ders the atmofphere of the liable warmer than that which is without; but this heat will not continue to be generated in a proper degree, unlefs the lungs are plentifully fupplied with frefh air, unpolluted by the breath and perfpiration of the animal, and the fumes arifing from his excrements. On this account, clofe llables do not increafe the internal heat of the horfe, but rather have a tendency to diminilh it, by rendering the circulation of the blood languid, for want of a fufhcient quantity of the natural llimulus of that portion of the atmo- fphere called oxygen or vital air. The confined vapour alfo becomes condenfed on the walls, racks, and mangers, producing a conllant and unhealthy dampnefs. As the horfe, when in the Hall, is llationed to one fpot, and confequently cannot warm himfelf by exercife, it therefore is not im- proper to clothe him moderately ; but, at the fame time, he Ihould breathe frefh air; for which pur- pofe nothing is required but an outlet for the foul air,

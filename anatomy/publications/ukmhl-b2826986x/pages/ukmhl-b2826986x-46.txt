20 ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. The takes its origin. Thus, if the horfe leans forwards, the center of gravity ceafes to be fupported, and he is obliged to advance one of his fore legs in order to recover the equilibrium. Again, if the chief fource of motion exifts in the fore quarters, whence does it arife that many good fore-quartered horfes are bad leapers? The reason is obvious: from weaknefs in their hinder quarters; for the principal ftrength of a horfe lies in the mufcles of his thighs. Therefore a horfe may rife well at a leap, and clear it with his fore legs, but cannot bring his hinder legs over, unlefs the mufcles of his thighs are fufficiently powerful. It may be urged, that leaping differs from gal- loping ; but galloping is, in reality, conflituted by reiterated leaps on a plain furface. Hence the neceffity of a good conformation in the hinder quarters*. * A ftrong inflance in favour of this do&rine may be adduced in the celebrated horfe Eclipfe, who was unqueftionably the mod fpeedy horfe of his day. His fore quarters were very ill formed, and his fhoulder low ; but his hinder quarters were particularly ftrong and mufcular.

ON LAMENESS. 83 M 2 THE the bone confequently takes place. In this Hate, the bone (which, when free from difeafe, is per- fectly infenfible) becomes extremely irritable, and the pain which the animal experiences from the concuflion of the limb when it alights on the ground, is fufficient to occafion lamenefs. This fenfibility of the bone will continue until the periofteum yields, and adapts itfelf to the in- creafed fubftance which is contained within it. If the fplent is generated under a ligament, or under a tendon, it increafes the lamenefs; for, by difplacing the ligament, or the tendon, from their natural fituations, it more or lefs impedes their functions, until they adapt themfelves to their new direction. Inftances have occurred of an abforp- tion of fplents, without any external application; but cafes of this kind are fo rare, that it would not be prudent to truft to fo precarious an event. The bell mode of treatment conhfts in repeated blitters applied to the part, and cold water and bandage between the periods of their operation.

22 ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. The greater length to the haunch and thigh bones, without adding to the volume of the part wherein they are contained, and without removing the foot too far from the center of gravity. The hinder quarters, when viewed from behind, fhould appear wider from ftifle to ftifle (A A, 4, fig. 2) than from hip to hip (B B). Herein may be traced a llrong chara6teriftic of the blood horfe. The hips of the blood horfe are lower and narrower, proportionably, than thofe of the cart horfe ; on this account he is fuppofed to be weaker than the latter; but this is not the fa61. For if the croupe of a blood horfe is meafured from hip to hip, the fpace will be found (proportionably) to be as large as that of a horfe with wider and higher hips (vide pi Aifig- *) becaufe the furface is more circular, which, if extended flat, would occupy as wide a fpace. Hence it is evident that the blood horfe,. in this inflance, poffefles as large a propor- tion of mufcle, although it is concentrated into a circular form.

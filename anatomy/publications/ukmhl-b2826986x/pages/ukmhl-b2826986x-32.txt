6 ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. The This being the fa6I, it will not be difficult to difcover in what way the power of thofe mufcles may be increafed or diminiffied, not entirely by their own fufceptibility of ftimulus, but limply by their pofition when in a hate of inaÂ£tion. To explain this theory, will be the objeft of the pre- fent chapter. The body and legs of the horfe, exclulively of the head and tail, may be faid to form nearly a fquare, as reprefented in plate I. This fquare is divided horizontally into two parts, nearly equal, by the body and legs, as re- prefented by the line A A. It is again perpendicularly divided into three parts, as expreffed by the lines B C. The firft of thefe lines B, defcends perpendicu- larly from the withers to the ground, and gives the proportion of the fore quarters.

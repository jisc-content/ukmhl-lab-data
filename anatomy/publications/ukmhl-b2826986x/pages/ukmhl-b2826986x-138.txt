Thus, although he can receive air through his mouth, he returns it only through his nofe. Hence the horfe always manifefts great uneafinefs when he is held by the noftrils, as under thofe circumftances he naturally dreads fuffocation. From the pofterior part of the roof of the mouth a membrane defcends, the extreme edge of which lies on the furface of the tongue.

Immediately behind the velum

ON SHOEING. 4 3 poffeffed three points of fupport, viz. the wall, binders, and frog. But the common method of fhoeing completely fruftrates this defign, for the fhoe being made concave and thick at the heels, the points of contaft are thereby reduced from three in number unto one, that is to fay, the wall of the hoof only. This concavity of the fhoe next to the foie, counteracts the elaftic expanfion of the quar- ters and heels, by conftantly prefling them towards each other. The thicknefs of the heels alfo elevates the frog above the ground, and prevents the preflure which its texture and ufe require. Nature, faithful to her laws, refills injury with her utmoft efforts, but, unfortunately, is unable to counteraCl the con- tinued application of an injudicioufly conftruCled fhoe. Hence the mifchief arifing from bad fhoeing is flow in its progrefs, but fatally certain in its effe&s. For if the alteration of the form of the hoof, and the confequent lamenefs, were produced inftantane- G 2 oufly,

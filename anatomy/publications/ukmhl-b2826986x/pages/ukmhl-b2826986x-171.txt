From the fize and dire&ion of the mufcles of the ftomach of the horfe, fome anatomifts have been induced to attribute to it the a£tion of tri- turation ; but this opinion is eafily controverted by taking it in a mechanical point of view, for to be capable of triturating its contents, it appears necef- fary that it fhould poftefs the faculty of re-a£Hon, either in a lateral or a rotatory dire&ion, and both of thefe are completely prevented by the preflure of the abdominal mufcles and other furrounding parts, fo that the only a6tion which it pofleffes, is fimply that of compreflion. The fibres of the mufcles which perform this a£tion, are wrapped round the cardiac or receiving orifice of the ftomach in a tranfverfe dire£tion, by which means they a£t as a fphin£ter, and effe£lually clofe it, fo as to prevent regurgitation, or the return of its contents.

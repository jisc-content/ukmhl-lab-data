ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. 21 The hinder quarters commence from the center of the back, and continue to the tail, including the hinder legs. When viewed in a lateral direction, the dis- tance from the hip bone to the point of the rump fhould be very confiderable. Vide pL 1, /. I K. The ft!fie (E) fhould fall perpendicularly in a dire£t line under the hip (I). By this means the length of the thigh bone (from L to E) is increafed, and its pofition rendered more oblique and angu- 4 lar. The leg from the hough to the ground fhould be perpendicular, and exactly under the hip joint. Vide L L. The thigh above the hough fhould be broad and mufcular (MM); the hough wide, flat, and lean. The width of the hough mechanically in- creafes its powers, by removing the a£ling mufcle to a greater diflance from the joint, thereby lengthen- ing the lever. The utility of the above conforma- tion in the hinder quarters, confifts in furnifhing a greater

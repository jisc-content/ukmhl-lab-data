ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. 25 It is compofed of a firm horny fubftance, which becomes harder the nearer it approaches the toe. It confifis of two fets of fibres, circular and perpen- dicular. The circular fibres furround the whole, and by their contra£tile power, prevent the fides of the hoof from burfting afunder. The degree of denfity in thefe fibres, will depend on the texture of the ikin from whence they originate, and, on this account, the hoofs of blood horfes are commonly much harder and more compact than thofe of cart horfes, whofe fkin is of a more fpongy nature. The foie forms the bottom of the foot, and is clofely conne£ted with the wall, which connexion may be diftinguifhed at a fmall diftance from its edges. The foie is naturally concave, and if the wall is firm, and poffefles fufficient contra&ion, it will have the property of an arch. The frog is a fubftance proje&ing above the furface of the foie, and occupies the pofterior part of E

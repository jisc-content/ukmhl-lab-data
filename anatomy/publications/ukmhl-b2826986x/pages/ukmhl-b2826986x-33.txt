ON THE EXTERNAL CONFORMATION. 7 The The fecond line C divides the body from the hinder quarters, and {hews their proportion. Thefe three divifions are nearly equal, except that the center divifion is rather the wideft. The neceflity for this general proportion will be explained hereafter. The head fhould be fmall, and the countenance animated; the forehead ftraight and broad, the eye prominent, the ears ere£t, the noftrils open and thin, the mouth lean and deep, the pofterior part of the lower jaw fhould be open and capacious, which contributes much to the freedom of bending the head inwards, and is alfo confidered to facilitate refpiration. The form of the ear is admirably adapted for the purpofe of colle£fing found ; and it is worthy of remark, that a horfe feldom fleeps without pointing one ear forwards and the other backwards, to enable him to receive notice of the approach of objects in either direction.

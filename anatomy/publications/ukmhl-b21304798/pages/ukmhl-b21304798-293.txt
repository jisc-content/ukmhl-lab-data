257 the skull through the foramen opticum into the orbit. Around the edge of the foramen it separates into two layers, one of which is continuous with the periosteum of the orbit, and the other forms the sheath in question. The nerves of the third and fourth pairs, the first division of the fifth and the sixth pairs of the cerebral nerves are met with in the dissection of the orbit. The nerve of the third pair, the Motor Oculi passes through the fissura laccra into the orbit. It divides into two branches before its passage through the foramen, and immediately on entering the orbit, these two branches divide into other secondary branches which are distributed to the following mus- cles, the levator palpebrae superioris, rectus superior, rectus internus, rectus inferior, and obliquus in- ferior. From that branch of the third pair distributed to the obliquus inferior, there arises a filament which is joined to the lenticular ganglion, presently to be de- scribed. The nerve of the fourth pair, the Trochlearis, passes through the fissura lacera into the orbit, and proceeding to the inner side of the cavity, is distri- buted to the superior oblique muscle. The first division of the fifth pair, named the Oph- thalmic Nerve, passes through the fissura lacera into the orbit, and immediately divides into three branches, which are the Lacrymal Nerve, the Nasal Nerve, and the Supra-Orbitary Nerve.

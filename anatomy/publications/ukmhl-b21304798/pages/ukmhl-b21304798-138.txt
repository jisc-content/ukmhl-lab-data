102 lunda penis ascends to the body of the clitoris, and here divides into two branches, the superficialis dorsi clitoridis and the deep-seated branch which penetrates the corpus cavernosum clitoridis. The ultimate branches of the pudendal artery, distributed to the external organs of generation, have communications with the external pudic branches of the femoral artery. The pudendal artery frequently has its origin by a common trunk with some of the branches of the internal iliac, especially with the ischiatic artery. In the dissection of the abdomen, it is stated that the Inferior hlesenteric Artery, descending into the pelvis, changes its name for that of Internal Hmmor- rhoidal. This artery is now seen continuing its course along the posterior surface of the rectum, and between the layers of the meso-rectum. Its branches surround the rectum, and communicate freely with the other hannorrhoidal arteries. The Veins of the pelvis corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery, form by their union the internal iliac vein, which on the right side is placed immediately behind the corresponding ar- tery, and on the lelt rather below and on the inside of it. The Internal HjEMOrrhoidal vein, cor- responding to the internal hiemorrhoidal artery, as- cends from the pelvis into the abdomen, and is con- tinued into the inferior mesenteric vein. The Sacral Plexus of Nerves is formed by

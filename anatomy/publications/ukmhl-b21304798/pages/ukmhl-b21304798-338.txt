302 and thence converging towards the neck of the sca- pula, they terminate in a broad and thick tendon, which proceeds forwards beneath the deltoid and upon the shoulder-joint, to the capsule of which it is firmly united, and is attached to the middle part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri, immediately below the insertion of the supra-spinatus. Below the infra-spinatus, is The Teres Minor, which arises from the narrow depression extending from the neck of the scapula along its inferior costa almost to the Inferior angle. It proceeds obliquely upwards and outwards along the lower edge of the infra-spinatus, and terminates in a tendon which passes forwards beneath the deltoid and upon the capsule of the shoulder-joint to which it adheres, and is attached to the lower part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri, below the insertion of the infra-spinatus. In some subjects, the teres minor and infra-spina- tus are so closely united, that there is no natural line of division between them. Below, and behind the teres minor, is The Teres Major, which arises from a roueh and flattened service on the dorsum of the scapula just above its inferior angle, and proceeds obliquely upwards and outwards along the lower edge of the teres minor. Then leaving this muscle, it passes to the inside of the humerus, and terminates in a broad and flat tendon, which is inserted immediately behind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi into the posterior #

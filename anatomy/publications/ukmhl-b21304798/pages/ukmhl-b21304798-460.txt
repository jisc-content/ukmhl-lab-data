424 from the left. Towards the lower part of this partition there is an oval depression, which is the Fossa Ova- Lis. The fossa is deepest at its upper part, and be- comes gradually shallower from above downwards. Its surface is generally rough. Above, and on each side, it is bounded by an arch of muscular fibres, which is the Annulus Ovalis. The extremities of this arch are turned downwards, and are named its Cornua. In the upper part of the fossa ovalis, there is frequently an opening leading into the left auricle. Such, however, is the obliquity of this opening, and the disposition of its sides that in the living body, it is constantly closed, and there cannot be any mixture of the black blood contained in the right auri- cle with the red blood contained in the left. The fossa ovalis varies much in its size and appearance in difierent instances, and sometimes it is entirely want- ing. In the upper and back part of the right auricle, is the opening of the VT-na Cava Superior, inclining a little forwards, and opposite to it, in the lower and back part of the auricle, is the opening of the Vena Cava Inferior, which is the larger of the two. Be- tween the openings of the venae cavse, there is a slight increase of thickness at one point in the side of the auricle, so as to form a projection towards its ca- vity which is named the Tuberculum Loweri. This part, however, is in general very indistinct. Immediately below the opening of the Vena Cava In- ferior, is a crescent-shaped fold of membrane, which is the Eustachian Valve. Its extent varies consi-

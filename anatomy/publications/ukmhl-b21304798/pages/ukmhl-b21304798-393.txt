357 Between the upper and lower articulations of the radius with the ulna, the bones are connected by the interosseous ligament which is extended across be- tween their opposite ridges. Above and below, there is an interval left in the ligament for the passage of the interosseous vessels. The radius and ulna ai'e further bound together by a distinct band of ligamen- tous fibres proceeding from the coronoid process of the ulna obliquely downwards to the radius just below its tubercle. The lower articulation of the radius with the ulna is formed by the adaptation of the semilunar cavity in the inner side of the radius to the opposite side of the ulna. The articular surfaces of the two hones are covered by a reflection of the synovial membrane which covers the inferior extremity of the ulna. ARTICULATION OF THE RADIUS AND ULNA WITH THE BONES OF THE CARPUS. The articulation of the radius and ulna with the carpus, is secured by the following ligaments: An Internal Lateral Ligament, which is attached above to the styloid process of the ulna, and below, to the os cuneiformc, some of its fibres being also fixed to the annular ligament and os pisiforme. An External Lateral Ligament, which is attached above to the styloid process of the radius, and below, to the os scaphoides, annular ligament.

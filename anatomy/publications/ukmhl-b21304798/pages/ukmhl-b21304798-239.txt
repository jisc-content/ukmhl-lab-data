â‚¬03 and one for the heart, which is the Pericardium. These three serous membranes, like the others of the same class, form imperforate sacs, which are re- flected partly upon the walls of the chest, and partly upon the viscera, so as to give to each a smooth covering. When the sternum and cartilages of the ribs are raised, we see the two Lungs occupying the sides of the chest, and between them a middle partition, which is the Mediastinum. In the middle and lower part of the chest is the Heart concealed by the Pericardium. The Pleura; are generally represented as mem- branous bags, placed laterally with respect to each other in the chest, and forming, by their apposition in the middle, the mediastinum. But it will be ne- cessary to give a description more in detail of each pleura, in order that the student may understand the manner in which it is extended upon the walls of the chest, and how it is reflected over the lungs, so that each lung is completely on the outside of the pleura, as the abdominal viscera are on the outside of the peritoneum. As each pleura is an imperforate sac, it is imma- terial at what point the description of its course is commenced. If then we begin at the under surface of the sternum, the pleura will be traced from this point, extending itself outwards upon the whole side of the chest. It is united to the ribs and intercostal muscles by loose cellular tissue, and forms in this K 6

287 CHAP. XV. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED BETWEEN THE RIBS AND ON THE POS- TERIOR SURFACE OF THE STERNUM. Two layers of muscles connected by fine cellular tissue, are situated in the interstices between the ribs. They are denominated The External and Internal Intercostals. The fibres of the former are arranged obliquely from behind forwards, while the fibres of the latter have an opposite direction, so that the two layers cross each other. The External Intercostals extend from the spine forwards, to the union of the bones with the cartilages of the ribs. Here they terminate, so that from this point to the sternum, there exists only the internal layer of fibres. The External Intercostal muscles arise from the lower edge of each rib, and proceeding obliquely downwards and forwards, are inserted into the upper edge of the next rib in succession#

130 The IscHiATic Nerve usually divides itself at the lower third of the thigh into two branches. In many subjects, however, its division is found much higher, and in some it takes place even as soon as the nerve emerges from the cavity of the pelvis. Of the two branches formed by this division, one is 50 large as to have tlie appearance of the continued trunk. This retains the name of Ischiatic, until it enters the ham, where it becomes Popliteal. The smaller branch is denominated Peroneal. The Popliteal Nerve proceeds straight down- wards through the ham along the edge of the semi- membranosus, and then entering the space which is left between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, continues its course into the leg where it acquires the name of Posterior Tibial. The Peroneal Nerve proceeds obliquely down- wards along the edge of the biceps, and passing be- hind the e.vternal head of the gastmcneiiiius, turns a little forwards, and penetrates between tlie peroneus longus and fibula. Its further course will be de- scribed witlj the other nerves of the leg.

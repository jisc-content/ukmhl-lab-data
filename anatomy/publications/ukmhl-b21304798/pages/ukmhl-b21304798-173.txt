157 rates itself into four fasciculi. These fasciculi end in distinct tendons, which proceed forwards '’over the metatarsal bones, crossing the tendons of the extensor longus, and are attached to the metatarsal ends of the first phalanx of the great toe, and of the three toes next to it, where they are united with the ten- dons of the extensor longus. VESSELS AND NERVES IN THE FRONT OF THE LEG. t ■ The Anterior Tibial Artery passes from the ham between the lower border of the poplitous and the upper fibres of the soleus muscle, and through a wide aperture in the interosseous liga- ment to the front of the leg. It is here continued downwards, close upon the interosseous ligament, gradually approaching nearer to the tibia as it de- scends. In the upper part of the leg the artery is found between the tibialis anticus, and extensor longus digitorum muscles, and lower down, be- tween the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis. From the lower part of the leg, the artery proceeds forwards, and inw'ards over the ancle joint, and beneath the annular ligament, and crossing under the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, is placed between this tendon and the first tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. It is then continued di- rectly forwards over the tarsus to the space between (

163 is formed of cartilaginous rings connected by mem- brane. Behind it is flattened, and is formed wholly of membranous structure. Behind the larynx is a membranous bag, deno- minated the PiiAKYNX, which terminates below, just behind the commencement of the trachea, by con- tracting into a cylindrical tube, named the CEso- phagus. The (Esophagus is continued downwards behind the trachea into the chest. At its commencement the oesophagus is placed in the middle of the neck, but as it descends it inclines to the left, so that in the lower part of the neck, it projects a little beyond the side of the trachea. The oesophagus is united in front, to the trachea, and behind, to the vertebral column, by a loose cellular tissue. Between the sterno-cleido-mastoldei, two long and narrow muscles pass up the front of the neck. These arc the sterno-hyoidei. The Sterno-Hyoideus arises below, from the upper part of the posterior surface of the sternum behind its articulation with the clavicle, and some- times from the first rib. It proceeds upwards and inwards, approaching to the muscle of the opposite side, and is attached above, to the lower border of the basis of the os hyoides. A long slender muscle extends itself obliquely along the side of the neck. This is The Omo-Hyoideus. It arises from the superior costa of the scapula, behind the semilunar notch, and

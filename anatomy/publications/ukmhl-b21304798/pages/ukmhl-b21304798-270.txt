234 jaw below- It is, however, but a small part of the parotid gland which is exposed in a superficial dis- section, since, its substance is extended deeply in- wards into the hollow between the ramus of the jaw and the mastoid process, where it is firmly united to all the surrounding parts, namely, above, to the articulation of the Jaw, in front, to the inside of the ramus of the jaw and to the ptcrygoideus internus muscle, and behind, to the mastoid process and to the meatus auditorius, and at its lower part, the gland extends a little behind the front margin of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscle. In some subjects, the lower end of the parotid terminates at the angle of the jaw, and is here separated from the submax- illary gland, by an interval containing only cellular tissue, while in others, the two glands are continued into each other. The external carotid artery and the facial nerve lie imbedded in the substance of the parotid. One or two absorbent glands are found superficially upon the parotid, or are partly imbedded in its substance. The excretory duct of the parotid emerges from the front margin of the gland, and proceeds horizon- tally across the masseter muscle, at about an inch below the zygoma. The duct reaching the anterior edge of the masseter then turns inwards, through the fat of the cheek to the buccinator muscle, which im- penetrates, and finally opens into the mouth by a small round orifice opposite to the first grinding tooth of the upperjaw.

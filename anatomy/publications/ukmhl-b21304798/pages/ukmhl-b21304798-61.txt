25 with the spleen itself, are frequently found distinct, and at some distance from it, but connected with it by vessels, and by the peritoneum. The peritoneum is continued from the diaphragm and stomach to the spleen. A distinct fold of the membrane intervenes between ihe diaphragm and the upper end of the spleen ; and the two layers of peri- toneum, covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach, are continued from its great end across to the inner concave side of the spleen. Be- tween the two peritoneal layers, which thus extend across from the stomach to the spleen, the vessels and nerves of the latter are contained. The peritoneum, reaching the spleen from these sources, is continued round the organ, so as to give it a complete covering. The Intestines are the continuation of the ali- mentary canal from the pylorus, to its termination at the anus, and are altogether, about six times the length of the body. From the differences in the relative size of the intestines at their upper and lower parts, they are divided into the small, which compre- hend the upper and by far the greater part of the canal; and into the large, which form the lower and less considerable portion. The small intestines are divided into the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ilium, and the large, into the Coecum, Colon, and Rectum. The Duodenum is placed at the back part of the abdomen, close upon the spine, ahd is so con- cealed by its connexions with the surrounding vis- cera, that its situation cannot now be seen. c

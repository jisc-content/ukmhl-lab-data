353 of these, denominated from its figure, Conoides, is extended between the root of the coracoid process, and the rough eminence in the under part of the clavicle near its humeral extremity; the other, de- nominated Trapezoides, is a broad flattened band, which proceeds from the upper part of the coracoid process to an oblique line in the under part of the clavicle, extending from the insertion of the last liga- ment towards the humeral end of the bone. There are two ligaments which belong only to the scapula. One of these is extended between the acro- mion and the coracoid process, and forms with these bony projections the arch over the shoulder-joint. This ligament is of a flattened and triangular form. Its broad end is fixed to the external edge of the cora- coid process, and its narrow end, to the extremity of the acromion. It usually consists of two distinct bands separated by cellular tissue. From the front edge of this ligament, a layer of dense cellular tissue is continued downwards beneath the deltoid muscle, and upon the tendons of the supra and infra-spinatut muscles. The other ligament of the scapula extends from the basis of the coracoid process across the supra- scapulary notch to the opposite angle of the bone. The notch is thus converted into a hole for the pas- sage of the supra-scapulary vessels and nerve.

399 to the extremity of the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It then continues its course forwards between the dura mater and the basis of the skull to the internal temporal fossa, where it swells into a thick flattened band, denominated the Ganglion Gasserianum. This band is of a semi- lunar form. Its concave side is joined with the trunk of the nerve, and from its convex side, there proceed the three divisions of the nerve next to be men- tioned. 1. The Ophthalmic Nerve, which enters the cavernous sinus, and proceeds along its external side to the fissura lacera, through which it passes into the orbit. 2. The Superior Maxillary Nerve, which passes out of the skull through the foramen ro- tundum. 3. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve, which passes out of the skull through the foramen ovale. The sixth pair of nerves is named the Abduc- TORES or Motores Externi, and is intermediate in size between the third and fourth pairs. It arises from the lower margin of the tuber annulare, and proceeds upwards and forwards to the lateral part of the basilar process of the occipital bone. Here it penetrates the dura mater, and entering the cavernous sinus, continues its coufse forwards close to the outer side of the carotid artery to the fissura lacera, through which it passes into the orbit. The seventh pair of nerves is formed of two distinct

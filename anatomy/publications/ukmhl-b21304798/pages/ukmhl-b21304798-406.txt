370 bion extended between the opposite edges of the tibia and fibula. In its upper part, there is a large opening for tlie passage of the anterior tibial vessels, and another below, for a branch of the peroneal artery. The inferior articulation of the tibia and fibula is formed by the adaptation of the convex cartilaginous surface in the side of the fibula, to the opposite con- cave surface in the side of the tibia. These surfaces are covered by'a reflection of the synovial membrane from the ancle joint. Ligamentous bands are ex- tended obliquely across from the tibia to the fibula, both in front and behind the articulation, and the tw'O bones are further connected by a fibrous substance passing between their contiguous sides, just above the cartilaginous surfaces. O ARTICULATIONS OF THE TIBIA AND FIBULA WITH THE TARSUS. The articulation of the tibia and fibula with the astragalus, forming the ancle joint, is secured by several strong ligaments. The Internal Lateral Ligament, or Liga- MENTUM Deltoides, is of Considerable breadth. It arises above from a great part of the circumference of the malleolus internus, and descending rather in a radiated manner, terminates below by a very broad insertion into the sides of the. astragalus, os calcis, and os naviculare. The breadth of this ligament is

116 close upon the capsule to be attached to the trochanter minor. A large bursa mucosa is placed between the tendon and the capsule of the hip. The Triceps Adductor. This consists of three portions descending from the inside of the os pubis and ischium to the inner side and back part of the thigh. These portions are distinguished by the epi- thets Longus, Brevis, and Magnus. The Adductor Longus is placed most super- ficially along the lower and inner edge of the pectinalis. The Adductor Brevis, the smallest portion, is placed partly behind the adductor longus and partly behind the pectinalis. The Adductor Magnus is the large mass of muscle situated behind the adductor longus and brevis, and extending towards the back part of the thigh. The Adductor Longus arises by a short round tendon from the upper part and inside of the os pubis near its symphysis. It forms a thick muscle which becomes broader as it descends, and terminates by a tendinous attachment to the linea aspera in its middle part and along one third of its extent. The Adductor Brevis arises by a thick flat tendon from the lower part of the os pubis near its symphysis, and descending inwards behind the pecti- nalis and adductor longus, is inserted tendinous into the upper part of the linea aspera, above and behind the insertion of the adductor longus. The Adductor Magnus arises tendinous from the ramus of the os pubis and ischium as low down as

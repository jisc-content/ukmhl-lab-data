117 the tuberosity. It forms a very broad and large muscle, the fibres of which run outwards and down- wards with various degrees of obliquity. The upper fibres run almost directly across the back part of the thigh, and along the lower edge of the quadratus femoris to be inserted into the upper part of the linea aspera. The lower fibres proceed more obliquely downwards to be attached to the linea aspera and to the oblique ridge leading to the inner condyle, and into the condyle itself by a round tendon. These three portions of the triceps are often so intimately connected as to render their separation difficult. The Gracilis arises by a flat tendon from the lower part of the os pubis close to its symphysis, and proceeds strait down the inside of the thigh to the knee, where it ends in a tendon which turns forwards and is attached to the inside of the tibia between the tendons of the sartorius and semitendinosus. The Rectus arises by two tendons, one from the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, the other from the surface of the ilium just above the acetabulum and \ from the capsule of the hip joint. The two tendons soon unite, and end in a mass of muscle which proceeds strait downwards, and becomes gradually broader to the middle of the thigh. Here it contracts, and termi- nates in a thick flat tendon which is connected on each side with the tendons of the vasti, and is attached to the upper extremity of the patella. The Vastus Exteunus arises from the lower part I

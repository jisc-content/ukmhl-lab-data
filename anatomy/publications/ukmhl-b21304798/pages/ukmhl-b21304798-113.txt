77 front and lower parts, receive no such investment. In some subjects, however, the peritoneum is ex- tended beneath the inferior part of the bladder, al- most to the back of the prostate gland, before it is re- flected to the rectum. As the peritoneum is reflected from the bladder to the rectum, it forms two small folds, one on each side of the pouch just described. These are sometimes denominated the Posterior Ligaiuents of the bladder. The peritoneum reaching the rectum is continued from below upwards upon the gut, covering at first only its anterior side, but afterwards gradually en- circling it. From the upper and back part of the rectum, the peritoneum is continued to the sacrum in the form of two layers, which are named the Meso-rectum. The form of the meso-rectum is triangular, narrow below and broad above ; ^nd be- tween its layers the vessels and nerves of the rectum lie imbedded. The meso-rectum is continuous above, with the peritoneum covering the lumbar vertebrae. Some dissection will now be required before the several organs contained in the pelvis can be dis- tinctly seen. The fat and cellular tissue are to be cautiously removed from the lower part of the rec- tum, when the greater part of the levator ani muscle will be seen in its course downwards by the side of the prostate gland, neck of the bladder, and rectum. The muscle is necessarily separated from its origin E 3

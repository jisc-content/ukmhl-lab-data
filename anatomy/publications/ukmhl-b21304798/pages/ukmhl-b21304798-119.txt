83 the pelvis to the lateral anrl back part of the bladder. Becoming connected with the bladder by cellular tissue, the tube turns downwards round the side of the organ, just in the situation where the pe- ritoneum is reflected from it outwards to the walls of the pelvis. The vas deferens then proceeds forwards beneath the inferior part of the bladder, where it gradually approaches the tube of the opposite side. The two tubes are here placed on the inside of the vesicultB • seminales, and gradually approaching, they meet at the back part of the prostate gland. Each vas deferens here unites with the vesicula semi- nalis, which is next to it, and by their junction the common, or ejaculatory duct, is formed, which pro- ceeds forwards, between the neck of the bladder and the prostate, and terminates in the under side of the urethra, where it passes through the gland. The Vesicula Skmixales arc two bodies of -a pyriform shape, and convoluted appearance, and are placed between the low'er part of the bladder and the I'ectuin. They arc imbedded in a considerable quantity of loose cellular tissue. The narrow end of each vesicula is connected with the back of the prostate, and is joined to the vas deft’iens in the man- ner just stated. From the prostate, the two vesiculae are extended outwards and backwards on the outside of the vasa deferentia, and terminate behind by rounded extremities.

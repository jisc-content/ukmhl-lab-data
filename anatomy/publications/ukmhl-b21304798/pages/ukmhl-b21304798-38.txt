n abdomen, the student must be careful to avoid in- juring the tendinous fibres which are immediately beneath it, and in continuing the dissection from the middle of the abdomen outwards, he must look for the line where the tendinous fibres terminate, and the fleshy fibres begin. The fleshy fibres are then to be cleanly dissected in their whole course over the side of the abdomen and upon the cartilages of the ribs. The first muscle exposed is The Obuquus E.xternus or Descenders, which is a broad and thin muscle, extending from the thorax to the pelvis, and from the back part to the front and middle of the abdomen. It is fleshy above, and at the side, and tendinous in its anterior and lower part. It arises by seven or eight distinct fleshy portions, denominated digitations, from the external surfaces and lower edges of the seven or eight inferior ribs near their cartilages. The four or five upper digitations of the external oblique are re- ceived between corresponding portions of the serratus magnus muscle, and the two or three lower digita- tions are connected with the portions of the latissimus dorsi muscle, which are attached to the lower ribs. A distinct fleshy slip is sometimes seen connect- ing the upper part of the external oblique to the pectoralis major muscle. The fibres of the external oblique proceed from their origins obliquely dow'n- wards, and terminate in the following manner. From the three lower ribs, the fasciculi run almost directly

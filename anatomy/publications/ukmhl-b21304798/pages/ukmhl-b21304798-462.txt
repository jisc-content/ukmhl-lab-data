426 opened by an incision, which is to extend down the middle of its anterior side from the basis to the apex. Throughout the greater part of the internal surface of the right ventricle, there is an irregular network of muscular fasciculi, denominated Carne.^e Co- I lumna;. These fasciculi are very irregularly ar- ranged. Some of them are attached in their whole length to the side of the ventricle. Others are at- tached only at their extremities; and, lastly, there are other fasciculi, w'hich are fixed at one extremity only to the side of the ventricle, and at the other ex- tremity by tendinous threads, to the valve which in- tervenes between the auricle and the ventricle. Some of the fasciculi extend directly from the basis / to the apex of the ventricle, and others cross these ob- liquely. The valve, which intervenes between the right auricle and ventricle, is of a membranous structure, and of a circular form above, where it is attached to the circumference of the Annulus Ve- nosus. Thence extending downwards into the ven- tricle, its loose edge is divided into several pointed portions, three of w'hich are more considerable than the rest, whence the whole valve is called Tri- cuspid. From the loose edge of the Tricuspid Valve there arise numerous tendinous threads, named Chorda; Tendinea;, which descend in the ven- tricle. Some of them are fixed to the projecting ends of the carnese columnse, and others to the sides of the ventricle. Besides the chordae tendineae,

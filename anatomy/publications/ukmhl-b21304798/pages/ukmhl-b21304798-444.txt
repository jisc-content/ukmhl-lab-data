408 face. In the pterygo-maxillary fossa, the superior maxillary nerve generally gives off two branches which pass downwards, and unite close by the side of the spheno-palaline foramen. At the point of their union a swelling is formed, which is named the Spheno-Palatinr Ganglion. Sometimes there is only one branch which enlarges a little in the situation just mentioned. From the spheno-palatine ganglion there proceed the Spheno-PalaTine, Palatine, and Vidian Nerves. 1. The Spheno-Palatine, or Nasal Nerves pass in variable number through the spheno-palatine foramen into the nose, where they are principally distributed. One filament descends in the nose to the palate, and passes through a canal in the bone behind the foramen incisivum, to be distributed upon the palatine membrane. 2. The Palatine Nerves are three in number, one large and two smaller. The large palatine nerve descends through the pterygo-palatine canal formed between the maxillary, palatine, and sphenoid bones, and emerging from the canal at the posterior palatine foramen, then bends forwards jind divides into several branches, which are distributed to the palatine mem- brane and gums of the upper teeth. The two smaller palatine nerves arc placed behind the former, and descend through distinct bony canals. They are dis- tributed to the tonsils, velum palati, and uvula. 3. The Vidian, or Pterygoid Nerve passes backwards through the hole at the basis of the pterygoid

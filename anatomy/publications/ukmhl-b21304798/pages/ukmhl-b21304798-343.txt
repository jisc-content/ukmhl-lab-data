307 SECT. II. OF THE FOREARM, FRONT PART. Upon the removal of the integuments from the forearm, we meet with the filaments of the External and Internal Cutaneous Nerves, and the Superficial Veins ramifying upon the fascia. These have been already described in tlie dissection of the upper arm. The muscles of the forearm are covered by a fascia, which is thick and strong, especially on the back part. The fascia should be exposed all the way round the forearm, in order to learn its extent and connexions before the dissection of the muscles is commenced. We shall then see that it not only binds .down the muscles, but sends processes inwards between them, to which their fibres are closely united. At the upper part of the forearm, the fascia is connected in front, with the expansion given off from the tendon of the biceps. On each side, it is attached to the condyles of the humerus, and behind, to the tendon of the triceps, to the olecranon, and to the ulna, nearly in its whole length. At the

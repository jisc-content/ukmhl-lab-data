385 Lucidum. If the corpus callosum is cut transversely near its middle, and its anterior part carefully turned torwards, the two layers of white substance forming the septum lucidum, and the space between them will be distinctly seen. Below the Septum Lucidum is the Fornix. This is a triangular body with its broadest part turned backwards. It commences in front by two rounded cords, named the Anterior Crura. These cords bend downwards to the basis of the brain, and here terminate in two eminences, named the Corpora Albicantia. The anterior crura unite and form the body of the fornix, which proceeds backwards, and is continued into two flattened bands of white substance, named the Posterior Crura. The posterior crura diverge from each other, and descend into the Inferior Horns of the Ventricles to their tewnination. Each posterior crus, as it passes through the inferior horn of the ventricle, ad- heres by one margin to an eminence, named the Hippocampus Major. The other margin of the crus, which is turned forwards, is quite loose* and receives the name of Corpus Fimbriatum, or T;enia Hippocampi. On each side of the anterior extremity of the for- nix, there is a small chink leading obliquely down- wards from the lateral ventricles into the middle or Â» third ventricle. This is the Foramen of Monro. When the fornix is raised, as by the accumulation of s

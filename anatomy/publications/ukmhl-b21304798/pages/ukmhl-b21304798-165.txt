129 G 5 Three or four Absorbent Glands are found deeply imbedded in the fat. of the ham, and situated near the popliteal artery; but they are generally so small, that a very careful dissection is required to discover them. The Popliteal Artery descends rather ob- liquely outwards through the ham. It first passes between the flexor muscles, and next between the condyles of the femur and the heads of the gastroc- nemius. It is then continued downwards behind the knee joint, passing close upon the capsule and over the popliteus muscle. At the lower edge of the latter it terminates by dividing into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The popliteal artery gives off The Articular Arteries, which consist of four or five branches, arising from both sides of the trunk, and thence ramifying round the knee. They communicate above with the lower perforating arte- ries, and with the external circumflex, and below, with the recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. Besides the articular arteries, other smaller branches are given off by the popliteal to the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and to the parts in the ham. The Popliteal Vein, formed by the union of the anterior and posterior tibial veiivs, proceeds up- wards through the ham behind, and a little on the outer side of the popliteal artery. The popliteal vein receives a large branch, denominated the saphena minor or externa which ascends from the outer side of the leg.

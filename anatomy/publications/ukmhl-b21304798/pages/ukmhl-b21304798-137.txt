101 F 3 by dividing into two branches which will be presently mentioned. The artery is covered in this part of its course within the pelvis by the aponeurotic expansion, which Is extended over the obturator internus muscle. The branches which it gives off before its division are, (а) Several arteries to the muscles of the buttock, some of which descend upon the back of the thigh, and communicate with the internal circumflex branch of the femoral, and with the obturator artery. (б) H.emorr,hoidales Extern;e, distributed to the levator and sphincter ani muscles, and communi- cating with the haemorrhoidales medite. The two branches in which the pudendal artery terminates are named the perinea superficialis and profunda penis, the former of which has been de- scribed with the dissection of the perineum. The Profunda Penis, continuing the course of the pudendal trunk, proceeds upwards on the inside of the ramus of the ischium and pubes to the sym- physis pubis, where it divides into {a) 'I'he Superficialis Dorsi Penis, which is distributed upon the back of the penis to the glans and prepuce in which its branches terminate. (h) A deep-seated branch which enters the corpus cavernosum of its own side, and is distributed through it to its front extremity. The ramifications of this artery open into the cells of tlie corpus cavernosum, and by distending them with blood, produce the . erection of the penis. In females, the artery corresponding to the pro-

s 3 S89 commune posterius also communicates below, with the cavity of the third ventricle, but the velum is extended so closely over it above, that no interme- diate passage between the lateral ventricles and the third can take place through it, while the parts retain their natural connexions. By gently separating the sides of the thalami optici, where they are in contact with each other, they are seen to be united a little below the level of their upper surface by grey substance, which is named the Soft Commissure. It has received this name in consequence of its being so soft in texture, that the weight of the parts on each side is sufficient to break it. The thalami then separate from each other, and no appearance remains of union having existed be- tween them. A rounded cord of white substance extends trans- versely across the anterior extremity of the middle ventricle, and immediately in front of the anterior crura of the fornix. This is the Anterior Com- missure. A similar cord extends transversely across the pos- terior extremity of the middle ventricle, and imme- diately beneath the basis of the pineal gland. This is the Posterior Commissure. If a probe be introduced into the third ventricle, and passed in a direction downwards and forwards, below the anterior commissure, it will penetrate a conical process of grey substance, named the In- fundibulum, which extends from the lower and

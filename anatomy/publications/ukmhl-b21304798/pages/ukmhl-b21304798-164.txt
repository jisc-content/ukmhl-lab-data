128 SECT. III. OF THE HAM. The Ham is the space left between the tendons of the muscles, at the lower and back part of the thigh, and behind the bend of the knee joint. The tendons thus forming the lateral boundaries of this ^ space are named the ham-strings, and consist of the semitendinosus and semimembranosus on the inner side, and the biceps on the outer. I'he lower boundary of the ham is formed by the two heads of the gastrocnemius, which pass obliquely down- wards from the upper and back part of the con- dyles of the femur into the leg, and here unite into a single muscle a little below' the knee joint. The Fascia Lata covering the ham is very thin, and beneath it, is a large quantity of soft fat. In dissecting through this fat, the popliteal nerve is first exposed. The popliteal vein and artery are placed more deeply than the nerve, and are closely con-' nected by cellular tissue. The artery lies beneath the vein, and is almost in contact with the femur.

84 of the pelvis. Beginning above at the superior aper- ture of the pelvis, where it inclines rather to the left side, it extends downwards in the hollow of the sacrum, and gradually approaching to the middle line of the body terminates below at the opening of the anus, which is situated about an inch in front of the point of the coccyx. In front, the rectum is separated from the bladder, only by the peritoneal coverings of the two organs, and behind, it is united to the sacrum by the meso-rectum. The extremity of the gut is sur- rounded by the fibres of the sphincter, and higher up, the gut is covered on each side to a considerable extent by the fibres of the levator ani. .4.

110 thigh, it is here contained in a tendinous sheath, and then passes into the ham through a wide open- ing left between the tendons of those portions of the triceps hereafter described as the adductor longus and magnus. In the ham it acquires the name of popliteal. In passing beneath Poupart’s ligament, the femoral artery is found just above the smooth surface in the upper and front part of the os pubis, and at the mid- space between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and thd spine of the pubes. The femoral vein in passing beneath Poupart’s ligament is found close by the inner side of the artery, a thin stratum of cel- lular tissue only intervening. The anterior crural nerve is found about half an inch on the outer side of the artery, and some fibres of the psoas magnus .are seen projecting between them. Between the integuments and the femoral artery in the upper part of its course, the fascia lata and cellular tissue only intervene ; but as the artery de- scends, it becomes covered in front by the sartorius, which crosses obliquely over it, and conceals it in the rest of its course down the inside of the thigh. • The tendinous sheath in which the artery is lodged just before it enters the ham, is formed in the fol- lowing manner. Posteriorly and laterally, it is formed by the tendon of that portion of the triceps, denominated the adductor longus, and by the tendon of the vastus internus. Anteriorly, it is formed by a broad portion ot fascia which is extended across from the tendon of the adductor magnus to the vastus in-

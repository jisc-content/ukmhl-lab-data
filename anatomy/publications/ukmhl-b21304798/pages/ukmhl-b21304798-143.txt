107 directed upwards. It is over this second semilunar edge that the vena saphena passes, as it ascends to the interval between the two portions of the fascia \ where it joins the femoral vein. These semilunar edges are occasionally not distinct in fat subjects, in whom the fascia is often separated into layers, with fat deposited between them. We may here observe, that for the dissection of fascias, and other parts of a tendinous nature, emaciated and anasarcous subjects are the most suitable. The anatomy of the fascia lata at the upper and inner part of the thigh, as here described, may be easily comprehended by the student in his first dis- section, but for a complete knowledge of these im- portant parts, he must refer to the more minute de- scription of them in Mr. Lawrence's Treatise on Rup- tures. The fascia lata being removed from the front and sides of the thigh, it must be the first object of the student to expose the trunks of the femoral vessels and the anterior crural nerve, immediately below Poupartâ€™s ligament. The femoral vein is situated in- ternally, or is the nearest to the pubes. The artery is situated close to the outer side of the vein, and the crural nerve at a short space from the outer side of the artery. Having well remarked the situation of these vessels and of the nerve, the student should then proceed to clean the muscles which occupy the front and sides of the thigh, taking care, in the mean time, not to sepa- F 6

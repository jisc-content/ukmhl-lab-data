12a ridge. Its fibres proceed downwards, converging into a tendon which is attached to the upper and front part of the trochanter major. A small pyramidal muscle emerges from the ischiatic notch, and descends obliquely over the glutaeus minimus to the trochanter major. Iâ€™his is The Pyriformis. It has its origin within the pelvis from the hollow of the sacrum, by distinct fleshy digitations, which are attached to the bone in the intervals between the anterior sacral foramina. Some fibres also arise from the anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament and adjacent part of the ilium. 'Hie muscle passing out at the great sacro-ischiatic notch, proceeds obliquely downwards, and ends in a round tendon which is attached to tlie cavity at the root of the tro- chanter major, above the tendons of the gemclli and obturator internus, with which it is intimately con- nected. The pyriformis is sometimes separated into two portions, a division of the ischiatic nerve passing between them. Above the pyriformis, the glutaial artery passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-iscliiatic notch. Belo\\ the pyriformis, the ischiatic and the pudendal arteries, the ischiatic nerve, with some smaller nerves, also pass out of the same notch. At a short distance below the pyriformis, three small muscles are seen, one in the middle denomi- nated the Obturator Internus, and one on each side denominated the Gemclli, which are distinguished by

412 muscles in the tympanum, and a large branch, which is the Chorda Tympani. The chorda tympani enters the tympanum, and passes obliquely through its cavity between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus. Then leaving the tym- panum at its front part, it passes through the fissura Glaseri, and continues its course downwards and forwards to join the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The distribution of the facial nerve after its passage through the foramen stylo-masfoidcum is described in the dissection of the face. .

47 concave, so that when viewed from the abdomen, it presents an arched or vaulted form. It is divided into two portions, one superior and broader, denominated the greater muscle of the diaphragm, which forms the partition between the chest and the abdomen, the other inferior and smaller, denominated the lesser muscle, which is connected with the back part of the former, and is extended along the bodies of the lumbar vertebra?. A broad and thin aponeurosis, de- nominated the Central Tendon, intervenes between the two portions. The fleshy fibres belonging to the greater muscle of the diaphragm arise in front from the posterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, and frequently from the bones of the six lower ribs by digitations which intermix with similar portions of the transversalis muscle. From these origins, the fibres converge towards the central tendon, in which they terminate. The lowermost of the posterior fibres are also attached to a tendinous expansion, denominated the Ligamentum Arcuatum, which extends across from the extremity of the last rib to the trans- verse process of the first lumbar vertebra. The Cen- tral Tendon consists of a middle and two lateral portions, which together have been considered to re- semble the leaf of trefoil in shape. In the right side of the central tendon, and near its back part, there is a large opening somewhat of a triangular figure, through which the vena cava inferior passes from the abdomen into the chest. The tendinous fibres imme- diately around the opening have a decussated arrange-

278 the humerus, it twists itself beneath the teres major, and terminates in a broad tendon, which is inserted immediately in front of the tendon of the latter mus- cle into the posterior margin of the groove in which the tendon of the biceps is lodged. The upper part of the latissimus dorsi where it arises from the dorsal vertebne, is covered by the trapezius. A distinct fasciculus of fibres frequently proceeds from the pos- terior inferior angle of the scapula to the latissimus dorsi as it passes over the bone. It has been mentioned in the dissection of the ab- I domen, that the aponeurosis of the latissimus dors, being connected with the obliquus intemus, and with the serratus posticus inferior muscles, is sometimes described as a tendon common to the three muscles, by the name of the Fascia Lumborum. The trapezius and latissimus dorsi are to be re- flected from the back towards their insertions. In reflecting that part of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi which arises from the spinous processes of the upper lumbar vertebraj, the student will find it so in- timately united with the tendon of the serratus posti- cus inferior muscle beneath, as to require great care in eflecting the separation. Beneath the middle of the trapezius, are the Rhomboideus Major and Minor muscles. The Rhomboideus Major is the lowest of the two. It arises by aponeurotic fibres from the spinous processes of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrse,

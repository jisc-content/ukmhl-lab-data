406 The Circular Sinus is placed around the pitui- tary gland, and opens into the cavernous sinuses. The Occipital Sinuses are situated on each side of the foramen magnum, whence they ascend in the falx cerebelli, and terminate in the lateral sinuses. From the preceding account we find that the seve- ral sinuses communicate freely with each other, and that they all lead to the two Lateral Sinuses, which are continued into the Internal Jugular Veins.

348 two parts. It is attached at one end to the transverse processes of the fifth, and sometimes of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and to the back part of the sacrum. Proceeding horizontally outwards, it is fixed at its other end to the posterior superior spine, and to the back part of the crista of the ilium. OF THE ARTICULATION BETWEEN THE SACRUM AND THE ILIUM. When the ilium is separated from the sacrum, the connecting surface of each is seen to bo divided into two distinct parts, which result from the different modes of union between the bones in front and behind. In front, the ilium and sacrum are very firmly united by the intervention of cartilage which has been gene- rally regarded as a single piece, but which some anatomists have stated to consist of two distinct layers, one belonging to each bone. Behind, the ilium and sacrum are united by short intcrarticular fibres passing between their opposite surfaces. Upon the separation of the bones, these fibres arc detached, partly from one and partly from the other, so as to leave the surfaces of both rough and irregular. O O The articulation of the ilium with the sacrum is strengthened in front, by ligamentous bands passing irregularly over it, and behind, by numerous liga- mentous bands passing from the posterior superior and inferior spines of the ilium downwards to the back part of the sacrum.

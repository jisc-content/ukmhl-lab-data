127 flat tendon which gives an oblique origin to the fleshy fibres. These proceed down the thigh, and at the lower part end in a tendon which passes behind the inner condyle, to be attached to the back part and inner side of the head of the tibia. Some ten- dinous fibres are continued downwards from the in- sertion of this muscle into the fascia covering the popliteus muscle. Upon the removal of the muscles just described, the attachments of the triceps to the linea aspera in its whole length will then be brought into view. The perforating branches of the profunda are now met with, penetrating between the fibres of the triceps to the back part of the thigh. The IscHiATic Nerve descending along the back part of the thigh, passes first over tlie quadratus femoris and beneath the giutseus rcaximus, then over the posterior surface of the triceps and beneath the long head of the biceps and semitendinosus. It then enters the ham, and acquires the name of Popliteal. The ischiatic nerve in its course down the thigh gives off many branches, of which some distribute them- selves upon the muscles, and others ramify between the integuments and the fascia.

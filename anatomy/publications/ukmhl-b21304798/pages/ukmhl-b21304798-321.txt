185 side of the sacro-lumbalis and the six or eight lower, ribs. A small thin muscle is connected with the inside of the sacro-lumbalis at its upper part. This is The Cervicalis Descendens. It arises from the six upper ribs near their tubercles, and ascending, is inserted by distinct tendons into the transverse pro- cesses of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical ver- tebraj. Another small muscle is connected with the inside of the longissimus dorsi at its upper part. This is The TransVERSAEis Colli, which arises from the transverse processes of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrae, and ascending, is inserted into the transverse processes of the four or five lower cervical vertebrae. When the muscles which have been described are removed from the side of the spine, there is ex- posed. The Multifidus Spinje, which consists of bun- dles of fleshy fibres extended obliquely between the transverse and spinous processes along the whole length of the spine, from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum. The fibres of the multifidus spinae lie close upon the transverse and spinous processes, and at the lower part of the back, they are united to the posterior part of the sacrum and to the ilium. The Inteusfinales muscles are small bundles of fibres, extended between the spinous processes of the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar vertebrae. They are most

241 (c) Branches to the nose. The external maxillary artery ends in communi- cations with the infra-orbitary artery, and with branches of the ophthalmic artery. The veins returning the blood from the outside of the head and face, have a general arrangement cor- responding with that of the arteries distributed to the same parts. A Temporal Vein is formed on each side of the head, and descends close by the side of the temporal artery over the zygoma, and beneath the parotid gland. A Frontal Vein is formed at the upper and front part of the forehead, whence it descends upon the face by the side of the nose, and near to the inner corner of the eye, where it is denominated the An- gular Vein, and has branches of communication with the ophthalmic vein. The Angular Vein changing its name for that of Facjal, continues its course upon the face obliquely downwards and out- wards at a little distance from the artery to the lower jaw. Here it becomes placed close to the outer side of the artery, and is continued downwards into the neck. The Internal Maxillary Vein accompanies the corresponding artery. There is a considerable variety in the mode by which these veins terminate. In some subjects, the , Temporal, Internal Maxillary, and Facial Veins, unite to form the External Jugular Vein, while ip M

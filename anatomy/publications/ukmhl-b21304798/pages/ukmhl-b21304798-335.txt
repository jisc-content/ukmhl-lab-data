299 It enters the space between the second and third heads of the triceps, and winds obliquely round the os hu- meri, between the muscle and bone, and in com- pany with the' arteria profunda superior, to the outer side and lower part of the arm, where it is found deeply placed between the brachialis internus and supinator radii longus. Thence it descends into the forearm. The muscular spiral nerve gives off in its course down the arm many branches to the muscles, and one filament which descends super- ficially along the forearm. The Ulnar Nerve descends from the plexus strait along the inside of the arm, united by cellular tissue to the line of union between the triceps and brachialis internus. At the lower part, the nerve passes between the inner condyle and olecranon into the forearm. In its course down the arm, the ulnar nerve gives off small filaments, some of which are distributed upon the triceps, and others are lost in the integuments. Of the Bend of the Elbow Joint. Above the fascia, the Vena Mediana Cephalica, and the Vena Mediana Basilica, are seen passing over the front of the joint. Other superficial veins are seen ascending upon the sides of the Joint and terminate in the basilic and cephalic veins. The cutaneous nerves in their passage over the elbow-joint are closely connected with these veins, some filaments passing above, and others below them. Beneath the fascia are seen the Brachial Artery and the Median Nerve imbedded in o 6

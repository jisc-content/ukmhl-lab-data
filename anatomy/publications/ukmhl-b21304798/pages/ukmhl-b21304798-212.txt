176 vanccs forwards between the genio-hyoideus and mylo-hyoideus to the chin, where it is sometimes distributed ; but in other instances, it penetrates the mylo-hyoideus, and then ascends upon the lower jaw, distributing its branches to the muscles of the lower lip, and ending in conimunications with the other arteries of the face. Tlic Ranine Branch of the Lingual bends horizontally forwards along the middle of the under surface of the tongue, where it is in close contact with the fibres of the genio-glossus muscle. At the apex of the tongue, the two ranine arteries communicate by a transverse branch which is found beneath the fold of the mucous membrane of the mouth forming the fra?num linguce. 3. The External Maxillary arises behind the posterior portion of the digastricus and the stylo- hyoideus, and ascends in a tortuous direction be- neath the subraaxillary gland to the basis of the jaw. It then turns upwards upon the face close to the anterior edge of the masseter muscle, and here acquires the name of Facial. The description of its further course belongs to the dissection of the face. The external maxillary gives off in its course to the basis of the jaw, a branch of considerable size, de- nominated (a) The Submental, which advances forwards between the anterior portion of the digastricus and the mylo-hyoideus to the symphysis of the jaw, where it ends in branches to the muscles of the lower lip,

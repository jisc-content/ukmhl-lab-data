69 centre of the perineum where they meet the termi- nations of the transversus from each side, and the fibres of the sphincter ani from below. The Transversus PERiNEiis a thin and narrow muscle, which arising from the tuber ischii, and thence passing across the perineum, ends at the ten- dinous point in the centre just mentioned. The Transversus Perinei Alter arises from the ramus of the ischium, close to the tuberosity, and proceeds obliquely upwards in the triangular space between the erector and accelerator, where it terminates by an attachment to the side of the corpus spongiosum, and adjacent part of the crus penis. Many varieties occur in the arrangement of the , Transversi muscles. The muscle here described as the transversus alter, is sometimes wanting. A second transversus perinei is occasionally seen, either as a distinct muscle, or as irregularly scattered fibres, extending directly across the perineum, and ter- minating either at the tendinous point in the centre, or more deeply at the bulb. The Sphincter Ani is a broad band of muscular fibres surrounding the anus. It is united behind, to the point of the os coccygis by a ligamentous substance, whence the fleshy fibres take their origin and extending upwards on each side of the anus, encircle the extremity of the rectum. The fibres of the sphincter are for the most part connected above with the tendinous point in the centre of thÂ« /

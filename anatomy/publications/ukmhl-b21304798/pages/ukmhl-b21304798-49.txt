13 dually thinner below the umbilicus, until they are lost in ihe cellular tissue between the rectus and pe- ritoneum. , In the dissection of the rectus the epigastric artery, with its accompanying vein, is seen ascending oblicjuely inwards beneath the posterior surface of the muscle. The vessels are first placed between the rectus and the peritoneum, and next between the muscle and the posterior part of its sheath. Many branches of the lumbar nerves are met with ramifying between the abdominal muscles. The next stage of the dissection consists in the re- flection of the transversalis muscle from the perito- neum, which is immediately beneath it, and in doing this, there are certain parts ’situated just above Pou- part’s ligament, requiring a careful examination, on account of their importance as connected with the subject of hernia. ; The lower margins of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles having been left attached to Poupart’s ligament, the student must now detach them in one mass, and very carefully reflect them upwards, in order to bring into view a thin fascia, which is found just above Poupart’s ligament, imme- diately behind the transversalis muscle, and between it and the peritoneum. This fascia is denominated The Fascia Transversalis. Its general ap- pearance is merely that of a thin expansion, formed by condensed cellular tissue, but possessing consi- derable firmness and power of resistance.' It is at

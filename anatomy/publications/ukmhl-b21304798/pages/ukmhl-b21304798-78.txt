42 ^ite to the third lumbar vertebra, it bends from the right across the abdomen to the left side of the spine, where it terminates in passing under the transverse mesocolon. The intestine then takes the name of jeju- num. Three distinct portions or curvatures of the duo- denum are usually described; the first constituting that part of the gut which intervenes between the pylorus and the point where it begins to turn downwards ; the second, that part which descends in front of the kidney, and the third, that part which extends across the abdomen. Between the first and second portions a distinct angle is formed. By the second and third portions a kind of semi-circle is formed, with its con- vexity turned towards the right. -cThe Pancreas is placed at the back part of the abdomen in the epigastric region. It is of a narrow elongated figure, its length is from eight to ten inches, and its breadth about two inches. One end of the pancreas, being in some degree the largest, is denominated its head, and the other smaller end its tail. The great end of the pancreas is turned to- wards the right, lying on the inside of the second portion of the duodenum, to which u is firmly united by cellular tissue over a considerable extent of the gut. The pancreas is thence extended across the vertebral column, above and in front of the trans- verse portion of the duodenum into the left hypo- chondrium, where its small end is almost in contact with the spleen. 1 he duodenum and pancreas receive only a

4S partial covering of peritoneum. It is already known, that the superior layer of the transverse mesocolon is reflected upwards in front of the duodenum and pan- creas. The peritoneum, thus passing over both thesâ€™e organs, adheres to them, and affords them an invest- ment on their anterior surfaces. On their posterior surfaces, the duodenum and pancreas are connected with the surrounding parts by loose cellular tissue. The course and termination of the Pancreatic and Biliary Ducts are now to be examined. If an incision be carefully made horizontally along the middle of the anterior surface of the pancreas, its excretory duct will be discovered lying nearly in the centre of its substance. It runs from one end of the pancreas to the other. Beginning narrow at the small end of the gland, it gradually increases in size by numerous branches which it receives in its course, so that near its termination, the duct has attained the size of a crow quill. From the large end of the pan- creas, the pancreatic duct turns a little downwards to join the ductus choledochus at an acute angle, thus forming a common tube which terminates in the duodenum, at the part which will be presently men- tioned. The Ductus Communis Choledochus pro- ceeding downwards from between the layers of the lesser omentum, passes behind the right extremity of the pancreas, to which it is closely united. Then receiving the Pancreatic Duct, it terminates in the posterior side of the second portioji of the

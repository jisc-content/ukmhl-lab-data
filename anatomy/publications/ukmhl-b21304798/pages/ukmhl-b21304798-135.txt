^9 by one of the branches, and not by the trunk of the internal iliac. Sometimes it is altojiether want- ing. 6. Uterina, which entering between the layers of the broad ligament, passes along the side of the uterus, and is reflected to the posterior surface of the organ. It terminates in branches, which ramify through the substance of the uterus, and communi- cate freely with the artery of the opposite side. In its course to the uterus, the uterine artery gives off: (a) A branch to the fallopian tube and ovary, which communicates with the spermatic artery. (b) Branches to the bladder and vagina. 7. Obturatoria. The obturator artery passes forwards from the internal iliac to the upper edge of the obturator intemus muscle, and is then continued with the corresponding vein and nerve through the obturator foramen into the thigh, where it divides into two branches, which distribute themselves upon the capsule of the hip, and upon the surrounding muscles. They communicate with the internal cir- cumflex branch of the femoral and with the ischiatic artery. Before the obturator artery leaves the pelvis, it "ives oft' branches to the obturator internus muscle to the bladder and prostate gland. The obturator artery is subject to many varieties in the mode of its origin. It sometimes arises from the external iliac by a common trunk with the epi- , gastric, or it may have its origin from one of the principal branches of the internal iliac, as from the F 2

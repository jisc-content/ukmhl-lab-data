182 has the appearance of a slight swelling of the nerve than of a distinct substance, and occasionally it is al- together wanting From the middle cervical ganglion, the Sympa- thetic nerve is continued along the neck to the Infe- rior Cervical Ganglion, which is found in the hollow between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It cannot, however, be satisfactorily seen in the pre- sent stage of the dissection. The Sympathetic gives oft iii the neck, 1. From the Superior Cervical Ganglion, several sets of filaments, of which some communi- cate with the other nerves at the basis of the skull, and with the upper cervical nerves; others are distri- buted to the deep muscles of the spine; others to the larynx and pharynx, and to the thyroid gland ; and one particular set, which is formed into plexuses, de- nominated from their soft texture Nervi Molles, surrounding the trunk and branches of the carotid artery, and adheiing closely to their coats ; and lastly, a single filament denominated Nervus Cor- dis Supeuficialis, which descends along the neck, and joins the other cardiac ner\es. 2. From the Middle Cervical Ganglion the Sympathetic gives otf maiiy filaments, some of w hich communicate with the cervical nerves, and with the rcturrent, and Â«ihers unite to form the Middle Cardiac Nerve, w'hich descends along the neck

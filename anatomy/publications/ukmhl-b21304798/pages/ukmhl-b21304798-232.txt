196 The cervicalis superficiaUs is frequently a branch of the transversalis colli. Of the Axilla. The axilla is the deep hollow at the upper part arid inside of the arm, which is bounded in front by the pectoralis major muscle, and behind, by the latissimus dorsi. Within this hollow there lie imbedded the trunks of the vessels and nerves passing between the neck and the arm, with many absorbent glands, and a large quantity of loose cellular and adipose tissue. AVhcn the pectoral muscles are reflected, the ax- illary vessels arc not immediately exposed, as they are concealed by the loose cellular tissue just men- tioned. By dissecting carefully through tliis tissue, the Axillary Vein will be first seen, as it lies rather in front of the Artery. Behind the artery, is the Axillary Plexus of Nerves. The axillary absorbent glands vary both in their number and size. They are imbedded in the cellular tissue of the axilla, and are generally placed closely round the vessels and nerves. They are continued upwards beneath the pectoral muscles and the clavicle, and are connected with the ab- sorbent glands of the neck. Of the Axillary Artery. The subclavian artery, immediately after it has passed beneath the clavicle, acquiring the name of Axillary, continues its course obliquely downwards and outwards, be- neath the pectoral muscles, and through the axilla to the inside of the coraco-brachialis, along which it is

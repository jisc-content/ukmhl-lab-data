183 into the chest, and there joins the other nerves of the heart. The Middle Cervical Ganglion is frequently con- nected with the Inferior Ganglion by three or four branches, which encircle, the vertebral, inferior thyroid, and subclavian arteries. Occasionally these branches are altogether wanting, and the two lower cervical ganglia are joined, so as to form a continuous substance. OF THE CERVICAL NERVES CONNECTED WITH THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Between the occiput and the atlas is seen The anterior branch of the first cervical nerve, which has communications with the anterior branch of the second, and with the superior cervical gang- lion, and with the other nerves at the basis of the t skull. Below the preceding we meet with The anterior branches of the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves, which communicate so as to form arches between each other. From these arches other branches arise, which unite and divide again, and thus constitute altogether an intricate plexus, which is denominated the cervical plexus. The Cervical Plexus is extended along the side of the neck behind the mastoid muscle, and on the outside of the carotid artery and jugular vein. The nervous filaments are imbedded in much cellular

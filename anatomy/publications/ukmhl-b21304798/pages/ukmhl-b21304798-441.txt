405 same nature with that which lines the veins in other parts. The SupRUioR and Inferior Longitudinal Sinuses, The Fourth Sinus, or Torcular Hero- PHiLi, and the Lateral Sinuses, have been al- ready described in the dissection of the brain. Besides these, there are other sinuses to be examined in the basis of the skull. The Superior Petrosal Sinus is lodged in the groove running along the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus is lodged in the channel between the lower border of the petrous por- tion of the temporal and the adjacent part of the oc- cipital bone. Both the petrosal sinuses terminate in the lateral sinuses. The Transverse Sinus extends between the pe- trosal sinuses, afcross the upper part of the basilar process of the occipital bone. The Cavernous Sinuses are of large size, and situated on each side of the sella turcica, upon the body of the sphenoid bone. They communicate with the petrosal, transverse, and circular sinuses, and they receive the ophthalmic veins from the orbit. Between the laminae of the dura mater that form the bounda- ries of each cavernous sinus, there are found the internal carotid artery, the nerves of the third and fourth pairs, the first branch of the fifth pair,, and the nerve of the sixth pair. All these are connected by a fine cellular tissue.

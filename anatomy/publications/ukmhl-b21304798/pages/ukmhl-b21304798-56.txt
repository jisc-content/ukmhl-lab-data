20 across the epigastric region into the left hypochon- driura, which it fills to a greater or less extent, ac- cording to its varying size in different subjects. The forni of the liver is irregular. Above, it has an arched or convex surface, adapted to the under surface of the diaphragm. Below, it is unequally concave. On the right side, and towards the back part, the organ has a very considerable thick- ness; while towards the left, it becomes thinner, and in front, it terminates by a thin edge, which is situated immediately beneath the cartilaginous margins of the ribs. A fissure is seen in the front edge of the liver, marking the division between the right and left lateral parts, which are denominated its lobes. By lifting the liver a little upwards, and looking towards the back part of its under surface, we observe a distinct and projecting portion of a triangular figure. This is the Lobulus Spigelii, which cannot, however, be clearly seen until the liver is removed from the body. The liver is retained in its situation by certain folds of peritoneum connecting it to the under surface of the diaphragm, which are denominated its ligaments. Four of these are generally described, but they are merely distinct parts of one process of peritoneum. Two layers of peritoneum, connected by cellular tissue, descend from the under surface of the dia- phragm to the convex surface of the liver. These form the Ligamentum Latum or Suspexsorium Hep AXIS. The ligamentum latum is broad in front,

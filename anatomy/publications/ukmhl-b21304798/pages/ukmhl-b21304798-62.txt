26 The Jejunum and Ilium are the convoluted heap of intestines occupying the middle of the abdomen, principally in the umbilical and hypogastric regions. The CcECUM and Colon are so placed in the abdomen, as almost to surround the jejunum and ilium. The Rectum occupies the posterior part of the cavity of the pelvis. Hence its particular description will be given with the other pelvic viscera. The Jejunum and Ilium are so loosely attached to the back part of the abdomen, that their con- volutions have no fixed situation, but can readily accommodate themselves to the changes occurring in the adjacent organs. In order to discover the com- mencement of the jejunum, it will be necessary to lift upwards upon the chest, that portion of the colon de- nominated its transverse arch, which extends across the upper part of the abdomen, and is connected with the back part of the cavity by a broad portion of peritoneum, named the transverse mesocolon. It will be hereafter stated, that the duodenum passes at its termination under the transverse mesocolon, and immediately on the intestine appearing in front of the mesocolon, it acquires the name of jejunum. The upper Iwo-fifths of the heap of simill intestine are the jejunum, and the lower three-fifths the ilium : not that there is any part of the canal which visibly maiks the termination of the one, and the com- mencement of the other, since there subsist only some general differences between them. Thus the coats of

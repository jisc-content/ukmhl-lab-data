220 veins from the two or three upper intercostal spaces unite into a superior intercostal vein which terminates in the subclavian vein. 2. The (Esophageal Veins, with some small veins from the coats of the aorta. 3. The Right Beonchial Vein. The left bronchial vein ends in the left superior intercostal vein. On the left side of the spine, a large venous trunk is formed, which has received the name of Semi-Azygos. It begins below by branches of communication with the lumbar and renal veins in the abdomen, and it usually terminates in the middle of the thorax by passing across the spine to open into the vena azygos. It receives the left intercostal veins, and sometimes other veins from the surround- ing parts. The arrangement of the veins opening into the vena azygos will, however, scarcely be found alike in any two subjects. The Thoracic Duct passing from the abdomen into the chest, through the aortic opening of the dia- phragm, ascends upon the bodies of the dorsal ver- tebrae, between the vena azygos and the aorta. By carefully dissecting through the loose cellular tissue between these vessels, the duct will be readily seen in the form of a transparent,tube about the size of a crow quill. Reaching as high as the sixth or fifth dorsal vertebra, the duct here changes its direction, and ascends obliquely towards the left side, and be- neath the arch of the aorta. Then continuing its

230 nected with the descending fibres of the occipito- frontalis. The lower border of the orbicularis palpebrarum towards the inner side of the orbit is now to be turned a little upwards, when the origins of the next muscle will be brought into view, which is The Levator Labii Superiouis Albque Nasi. It arises by two distinct portions which are separated by cellular tissue, one from the nasal pro- cess of the superior maxillary bone, the other from the front edge of the orbit to the extent of an inch above the supra-orbitary foramen. The twâ€™o portions descending from their origins, become joined into one muscle, which is inserted partly into the side of the ala nasi, where it is united with the compressor na- rium, and partly into the upper lip, where it is united with the Orbicularis Oris and with the Levator Anguli Oris. Beneath that portion of the Levator labii superioris which arises from the edge of the orbit, the infra- orbitary artery, vein, and nerve, are seen emerging from the infra-orbitary foramen, and immediately beneath these, is a small muscle, named The Levator Anguli Oris. It arises from the fossa in the superior maxillary bone, just under the infra-orbitary foramen, and proceeding obliquely downwards and outwards to the corner of the mouth, terminates by mixing with the fibres of the Orbicu- laris Oris and the Depressor Anguli Oris. Two slender muscles arc extended obliquely across

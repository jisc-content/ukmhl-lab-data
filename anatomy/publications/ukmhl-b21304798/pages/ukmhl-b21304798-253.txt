217 most inlercostals communicate with the branches of ^he phrenic, epigastric, and circumflexa ilii arteries. As the intercostal arteries proceed along the ribs, they give off (a) Branches which enter the spinal canal, and are distributed upon the medulla spinalis and its co- verings. (b) Branches which penetrate between the trans- verse processes of the vertebrae, and are distributed to the muscles of the back. (c) Branches which are distributed partly to the I intercostal muscles, and partly to the muscles on the I outside of the chest. , The Par Vagum entering the chest on the right j| side, immediately in front of the subclavian artery, i and on the left, immediately in front of the arch of the aorta, the two nerves then proceed downwards ^ and backwards to the posterior part of the bronchi I and root of the lungs. They are next continued upon ithe oesophagus, which they accompany to the dia- phragm, the left nerve being placed towards the front of the tube, and the right at its back part. The two ^ nerves then pass out of the chest with the oesophagus rj through the cardiac opening of the diaphragm to be I distributed upon the stomach. The par vagum gives t off the following branches in the chest: , 1. The Recurrent, or Inferior Laryngeal Nerve. On the right side the recurrent nerve ^ arising from the par vagum, at an acute angle, just If below the subclavian artery, turns round the vessel L 1 I

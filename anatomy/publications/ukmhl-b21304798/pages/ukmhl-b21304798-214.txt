178 occipital and with the temporal arteries. In its course to the occiput, the occipital artery gives off (a) Branches to the muscles covering the posterior part of the spine, which communicate with the ver- tebral and other ascending branches of the subclavian artery. {b) A Meningeal branch, which entering the skull at the foramen jugulare is distributed upon the dura mater. 6. The PosTERioii Auricular, is a small branch arising from the external carotid beneath the parotid gland; it ascends to the back part of the ear, and divides into branches which are distributed partly upon the internal surface of the ear, and partly upon the side of the head, where they communicate with the occipital and temporal arteries. One branch of the posterior auricular enters the foramen-stylo-mastoidcum, and is distributed to the meatus auditorius externus, to the parts in the tym- panum, and to the internal ear. The further description of the external carotid artery belongs to the dissection of the face. The Internal Carotid Artery separating it- self from the external, proceeds upwards and a little inwards in front of the vertebra', and on the oXitside of the internal jugular vein, to the canalis carotideus. It is generally rather to-rtuous, and does not give off any branches before it enters the temporal bone. The further description of the internal carotid

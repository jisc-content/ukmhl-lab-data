402 The Internal Carotid Artery, having passed through the tortuous canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, proceeds from the upper or inter- nal opening of this canal into the cavernous sinus, and continues it course horizontally forwards in the groove of the sphenoid bone by the side of the sella turcica. When it reaches the anterior clinoid process, it turns upwards, penetrates the dura mater, and enters the cavity of the skull. Within the skull, the artery is first placed immediately beneath the optic nerve, whence it ascends obliquely outwards and backwards to the fissura Sylvii, and here terminates by dividing into two branches, which are the Anterior and Middle Cerebral Arteries. Before its division the internal carotid gives off, (a) The Ophthalmic Artery, which arising, near the anterior clinoid process, proceeds forwards through the foramen opticum into the orbit. Its dis- tribution has been already described, Chap. XI. (b) The Communicating Artery, which is a small branch proceeding directly backwards, and in- osculating with a branch of the Basilar Artery. The Anterior Cerebral Artery proceeds forwards and inwards to the fissure between the an- terior lobes, and ascends to the front margin of the corpus callosum, round which it turns, and then con- tinues its course backwards upon the upper surface of this body. Its ramifications are distributed to the surrounding parts of the brain.

I 155 The Lumbricales Pedis are four small muscu- lar slips, arising from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum near their commencement. They proceed forwards and end in distinct tendons, which arc at- tached to the insides of the first phalanx of the four lesser toes, and into the tendinous expansions covering their upper surfaces. The tendons of the flexor longus digitorum are to be divided and turned aside, when the remaining muscles of the foot will be brought into view, consisting of the Traxsversalis Pedis and Ixterossei. The Transversalis Pedis is a thin narrow muscle, extending across the foot, close upon the digital ends of the metatarsal bones. One end of the transversalis pedis is attached to the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and to the adductor pollicis. The other end of the muscle is attached to the metatarsal bone of the little toe. The Interossei are seven small muscles placed between the metatarsal bones. They are called ab- ductors and adductors of the toes to which they are attached, or they are separated into the Interossei Intehni seen in the sole of the foot, and the Inter- ossei Extern! seen on the upper part, of the foot. The Interossei Interni are three in number. They arise from the insides of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes, and are inserted by distinct tendons into the insides of the first phalanx of the II 6 same toes.

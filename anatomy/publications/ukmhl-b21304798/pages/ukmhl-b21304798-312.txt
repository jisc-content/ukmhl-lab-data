•76 CHAP. XIV. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED UPON THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE NECK AND OF THE TRUNK. When the integuments are reflected from the pos- terior part of the neck, and from the whole extent of the back, the superficial stratum of muscles which is exposed, consists of the Trapezius above, of the Latissimus Dorsi below, and of a small portion of the Rhomboideus between them. The Trapezius is a broad, flattened, and trian- gular muscle, extending from the occiput, downwards to the lower part of the back, and outwards to the shoulder. It arises by a thin aponeurotic expansion from the superior transverse ridge (T the occipital bone, from the whole length of the Ligamentum Nuchae* from the spinous processes oi the last cer- * The Ligamentum Nuch® is a thin stratum of fibrous suhslauce attached above to the tuberosity and middle per- pendicular line of the occipital bone, and thence extending downwards, is fixed to the spinous processes of all the cer- vical vertebras. From its lateral surfaces, which are flat- tened, the muscular fibres take their origin.

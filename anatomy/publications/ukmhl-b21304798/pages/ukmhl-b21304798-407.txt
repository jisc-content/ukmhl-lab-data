371 such, that it not only occupies the side of the joint, but also extends to its front and back parts. The External Lateral Ligament is thick, and of a rounded form. It arises above, from the extremity of the malleolus externus, and descending obliquely backwards, is inserted into the outer side of the os calcis. The Anterior Ligament of the fibula is placed in front of the preceding. It consists of a broad band of fibres which arise from the front part of the mal- leolus externus, and proceeding obliquely forAvards, are inserted into the upper and outer part of the astragalus. The Posterior Ligament of the fibula is situ- ated at the back part of the joint. It arises from the lower and back part of the malleolus externus, and proceeding obliquely downwards and inwards, is at- tached to the back part of the astragalus. The joint is further strengthened in front by liga- mentous fibres which descend from the front of the lower extremity of the tibia, and extending themselves irregularly upon the capsule, are fixed to the astra- galus in front of its upper articular surface. The synovial membrane covering the articular sur- faces of the ancle joint is reflected upwards, as already stated, into the articulation between the tibia and fibula. The membrane is very thin, and in the front of the joint, is loose, and covered by a considerable quantity of fat and cellular tissue. R ()â€¢

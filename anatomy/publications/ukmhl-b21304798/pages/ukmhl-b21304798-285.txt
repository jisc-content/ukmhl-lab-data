M 5 Â«49 formed by the os unguis, and by the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Above, it is closed, and has a rounded form. Below, it contracts in size, and is continued into the nasal duct. The tendon of the orbicularis palpebrarum crosses the sac trans- versely over its front part, and at about one-fourth from its upper end. The sac is closely adherent on its inner side to the groove in the bones, and on its external side, is covered by a membrane of a fibrous texture. The Nasal Duct, continued from the lower end of thelacrymalsac, descends obliquely backwards through the canal formed by the os unguis, by the superior max- illary and inferior spongy bones. It terminates in the nose on the ontside of the inferior spongy bone, and at about one-third from its front extremity by a small opening, which in its natural state has a slit-like ap- pearance, but becomes oblong or circular when the mucous membrane around it, is in any degree stretched. The orifice is overhung by the spongy bone, so as to be concealed completely from view, until a part of the bone has been taken away. The nasal duct is formed only by the mucous lining, which is continuous above, withlhe lining of the sac, below, with the pituitary membrane of the nose, and externally, is adherent to the periosteum of the bones surrounding it. The nasal duct and la- crymal sac are together about an inch and a quarter in length. The Lacrymal Caruncle is a small reddish

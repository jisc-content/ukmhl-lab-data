30 jieum in the same manner as the ascending portion of the intestine. The sigmoid flexure is surrounded by the peri- toneum, which leaves a loose fold behind the intes- tine, denominated the Left Iliac Mesocolon or Left Ligament of the Colon. Lastly, we have to describe the peritoneal con- nexions of the transverse arch of the colon. It will be recollected that the two layers of peritoneum, in- vesting the anterior and posterior surfaces of the sto- mach, meet and become connected along the line of its great arch. From the great arch of the stomach, they are continued downwards in front of the heap of small intestines towards the pelvis, and are then re- flected back again until they meet the transverse arch of the colon. By the course of these two peritoneal layers from the stomach downwards, and by the re- flection of the same two layers back again to the colon, the Great Omentum is formed, which thus consists of four layers of peritoneum connected by adipose and cellular tissue. The great omen- tum is also denominated the Omentum Gastro- COLICUM, in consequence of its extending from the stomach to the colon. The membranous layers, of which the omentum is composed, are so closely united, and so thin and delicate in texture that their distinct separation cannot be eflâ€™ectcd. Fre- quently, however, when the omentum is not much loaded with fat, if its two anterior layers are gently- lacerated, the hand may, without much difficulty, be

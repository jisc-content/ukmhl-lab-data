73 is placed behind the other parts of the cord. The left spermatic cord is the longest; hence the testicle on this side is removed to a greater distance from the aperture in the tendon of the external oblique muscle. ' The tunica vaginalis testis is an imperforate sac, and is connected with the testicle in the same man- ner as other serous membranes are connected with the organs to which they belong. Thus it forms a bag round the testicle, and is reflected upon the external surface of the gland, which thus receives a smooth cover- ing from the membrane, and is still on the outside of the sac. If the tunica vaginalis is punctured, and air blown into it, it will be raised into a bag on the front arid sides of the testicle. When the bag is com- pletely laid open, the membrane is seen to connect itself with the testicle along its posterior edge, and here it is reflected, first over a part connected with the testicle denominated the epididymis, and then over the gland itself. The tunica vaginalis is very thin. The external surface of the baglike portion of the membrane is covered by the cellular sheath of the cord, and that part of the tunica vaginalis which is reflected upon the testicle, is united to the fibrous membrane, which, enclosing the substance of the gland, is termed the Tunica Albuginea. The reflected layer of the tunica vaginalis, and the fibrous capsule of the testicle, are so firmly united, that they are generally regarded as one membrane. They may, however, be separated E

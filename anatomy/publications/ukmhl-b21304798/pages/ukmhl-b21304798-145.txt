109 On the inside of the thigh, at its lower part, is the Vastus Internus muscle. The front of the thigh is occupied by a mass of muscle, consisting of the Rectus, placed between the two vasti, and of the Cruraeus placed beneath the rectus, closely upon the front of the femur. The cruraeus is here necessarily mentioned, although it cannot be seen until in the progressive dissection of the vessels and nerves the surrounding muscles are separated. VESSELS AND NERVES ON THE FRONT OF THE . THIGH. The student having gained a knowledge of the names and general position of the muscles occupying the front and sides of the thigh, must now continue the dissection of the vessels and nerves; and in tracing these downwards from beneath Poupart’s ligament, he will be perplexed by a confusion of parts, unless he is careful to clean, in the first place, the trunks of the vessels and nerves, and then to follow the branches of each regularly to their ter- minations. The smaller veins may be removed in order that the arteries and nerves mav be more readily dissected. The Femoral Artery passes from beneath Poupart’s ligament, obliquely down the front and in- side of the thigh, over the pectinalis and triceps muscles. Reaching the lower part and inside of the

049 The Posterior or Great Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament is placed at the lower and back part of the pelvis. It arises from the posterior extremity of the crista ilii, from the sides and posterior part of the sacrum and coccyx, and descends obliquely out- wards, becoming gradually narrower and thicker, and is attached to the tuberosity of the ischium. The Anterior or Lesser Sacro-Ischiatic Ligament is placed in front of the former, with which it is partly connected. It arises from the sides of the sacrum and coccyx, and proceeding outwards I is attached to the spine of the ischium. Many ligamentous bands descend irregularly upon the back part of the sacrum. Some of these, sur- rounding the posterior sacral holes, contract them so as to allow only of the passage of small vessels and nerves. OF THE ARTICULATION BETWEEN THE SACRUM AND THE COCCYX. The coccyx is united to the lower end of the sa- crum by a thin layer of substance resembling the in- tervertebral substance of the spine. Thin layers of similar substance are found between the three pieces of the coccyx, which remain separate during the earlier periods of life. Ligamentous bands descend from the back part of the sacrum, over the lower end of the vertebral canal,

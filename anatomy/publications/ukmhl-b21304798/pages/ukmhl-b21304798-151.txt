ns \agime and the iliacus internus,' and descends the superior half of the thigh, passing obliquely in front of it to its inner side, whence it is continued almost in a strait line to the knee. Below the knee, it turns forwards, and ends in a flattened tendon which is inserted into the inside of the tibia just below its an- terior tuberosity. As the sartorius crosses the upper part of the thigh, it passes successively over the rectus, vastus intemus and adductor longus. In the lower part of its course it is placed between the tendon of the adductor magnus and the gracilis, and at its in- sertion it is placed above the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles, to both of which it is con- nected by tendinous fibres. The Tensor Vagina, or Fascialis arises by a short tendon from the anterior superior spine of the ilium between the sartorius and the anterior fibres of the glutaeus medius, and descends straight along the outer edge of the rectus to a short distance below the trochanter major, where it terminates by becoming enclosed within a duplicature of the fascia lata. The Pectin a LIS arises from the ridge in the upper and front pai t of the os pubis, and proceeds down- wards and backwards between the psoas magnus and adductor longus ; here ending in a flat tendon, which is fixed into the upper part of the linea aspera imme- diately below the trochanter minor. The insertion of the pcclinalis being exposed, the conjoined tendon of the psoas magnus and iliacus in- ternus will now be seen descending over the hip joint

3 downwards to be attached to the external margin of the crista ilii, along its two anterior thirds. In some subjects, the posterior border of the external oblique between the last rib and crista ilii is over- lapped a little by the latissimus dorsi, which must be raised before it can be brought into view, while in other instances, the latissimus dorsi and external oblique do not meet, but there is left between them a triangular space wherein the fibres of the internal oblique are seen. From the upper ribs, the fibres of the external oblique running obliquely downwards and inwards, end in an aponeurosis, which is ex- tended over the front of the abdomen to its middle, where it meets, and is united with the aponeurosis belonging to the opposite muscle. From the anterior superior spine of the ilium, the aponeurosis of the external oblique is extended ob- liquely downwards and inwards, and is fixed to the upper part of the os pubis. Its lower margin thus stretched between the two points of bone is rather thickened, and forms Poupartâ€™s Ligament, or, as it is now frequently denominated, the crural ARCH. At a short distance before the appneurosis of the external oblique reaches the os pubis, its fibres sepa- rate into two portions, between which an opening is left of a triangular form. This is the Abdominal Ring, or ring of the external oblique, through which the spermatic cord passes in the male and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. The

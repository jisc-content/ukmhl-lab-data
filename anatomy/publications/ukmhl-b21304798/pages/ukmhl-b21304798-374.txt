338 CHAP. XVIIl. DISSECTION OF THE JOINTS. It will be necessary that the joints should be ex- amined in their recent state, before the soft parts around them have become dried, or they must be macerated in water until the cellular tissue is so soft as to be removed with facility. ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. This joint has two lateral ligaments, a capsule formed by synovial membrane, and an interarticular cartilage. The External Lateral Ligament consists of two distinct bands, one having an oblique, and the other a pcrpcijdiculai' direction. They arise above, from the lower margin of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, and descending upon the capsule, are inserted into the outer side of the neck of thÂ« condyle of the lower jaw.

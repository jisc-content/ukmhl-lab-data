151 Arch, the convexity of which is turned towards the toes. Between the two first metatarsal bones, the extremity of the plantar arch inosculates with the trunk of the anterior tibial. From the convex side of the arch, there arise four digital arteries, each of these after proceeding some way forwards divides into two branches which run along the opposite edges of the toes. At the extremity of each toe, the arteries communicate, and form arches in the same man- ner as the branches of the Ulnar Artery at the ends of the fingers. From the concave side of the plantar arch, interosseous arteries are given off, and perforating branches which penetrate between the metatarsal bones, and anastomose with the arteries on the upper surface of the foot. The Internal Plantar Artery divides itself beneath the abductor pollicis into several branches, which are distributed principally to the muscles of the great toe. The Posterior Tibial Nerve entering the sole of the foot beneath the abductor pollicis, here divides into the External and Internal Plan- tar Nerves, The External Plantar Nerve proceeds to the outer side of the foot, and divides into filaments, some of which are distributed to the superficial, and others to the deep-seated parts in the foot. The Internal Plantar Nerve proceeds di- rectly forwards to the middle of the foot, where it H 4

141 CXEMius Externus, 01' Gemellus, placed super- ficially, and the Soeeus, or Gastrocnemius In- TERKUs, placed beneath it. The Gastrocnemius Externus arises by two distinct tendinous heads from the upper and back part of the condyles of the os femoris. The two heads, of which the internal is the larger, proceed obliquely downwards, and unite a little below the knee into one muscle. The muscle, as it descends, has a straight tendinous line, extending from the point where its heads unite, and dividing it into two equal halves. At about the middle of the leg the muscle is continued into a broad and flat tendon, which soon becomes united with the tendon of the soleus. Both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the gastrocnemius are formed in great part by apo- neurotic expansions, with which the muscular fibres are â€¢very firmly united. The popliteal vessels and nerve enter into the tri- angular space left between the two heads of the gas- trocnemius, as they pass from the ham into the leg. The gastrocnemius being reflected from its origins, the soleus is brought into view beneath it. Between them is seen the long narrow tendon of a small pyra- midal muscle, denominated The Plantaris. It arises from the upper and back part of the external condyle, where it is con- nected with the external head of the gastrocnemius, and proceeding downwards and inwards, it ends a

173 of the vertebral column. By dissecting a little in this situation, he will bring into view the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and par vagum, which are all lodged in the same sheath of cellular tissue. The Artery is situated nearest the trachea, the Vein on the outer side of the artery, the Nerve between and rather behind the artery and the vein. It is to be observed that the carotid artery and jugular vein are placed so near to each other that the vein in its distended state will advance forwards in front of the arteiâ€™y, so as almost to conceal it. Behind the sheath containing the vessels and the par vagum, the Sym- pathetic Nerve will be found in close contact with the front of the spine. It will be readily brought into view by drawing the carotid artery forwaids, and then cautiously dividing the cellular tissue which forms the posterior part of its sheath. The Carotid Artery, emerging from the chest, proceeds strait up the neck, parallel with the trachea, and is connected behind, by cellular tissue to the longus colli and rectus anticus major muscles, which lie upon the fronts of the b'ldics of the ver- tebrfe. As soon as the artery emergi's horn tlie chest, it has its course deep in the neck, and is covered anteriorly by the platisma myoides, stcrno-cleido- mastoideus, and by the cellular tissue connecting this muscle to the sterno-hyoideus. Higher in the neck, the artery becomes more superficial, and is covered only by the platisma myoides, and by cel- lular tissue, except where it is crossed by the omo- T ^ I

297 neck of the humerus, around which it turns in com- pany with the posterior circumflex artery, and ter- minates in branches distributed to the under surface of the deltoid muscle. The External Cutaneous Nerve, or Ner- vus Perforans, passes from the plexus obliquely downwards and outwards to the coraco-brachialis, the fibres of which it penetrates, and then proceeds directly downwards between the biceps and brachialis internus. At the lower part of the arm, it emerges from beneath the outer edge of the biceps, and be- comes placed superficially along the edge of the su- pinator radii longus muscle. It then continues its course over the front of the elbow joint to the ante- rior part of the forearm, where it is found between the integuments and tlie fascia. The nerve mav be traced superficially along the forearm, inclining to- wards its outer side, and at the wrist, it terminates in filaments, some of which are lost upon the thumb in front, and others pass to the back of the hand, and thence to the fingers. The external cutaneous nerve gives off filaments to the muscles in the upper^ arm, and in the forearm it gives off filaments on each side, which ramify upon the fascia, and-com- municate with the filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve. Occasionally, the external cutaneous nerve passes along the edge of the coraco-brachialis with- out penetrating its fibres. A branch of communica- tion is sometimes seen between the external cutaneous, and the median nerves, o s'

419 T 6 CHAP. XXII. OF THE GANGLIA AND PLEXUSES OF THE ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC VISCERA. A LARGE ganglion, of a flattened and somewhat semi-lunar form, is situated on each side of the abdo- men upon the crus of the diaphragm and near the coeliac artery. This is the Semilunar Ganglion. Numerous other smaller ganglia of variable size and figure are placed near the semilunar. All these gan- glia are united by numerous short and thick nervous filaments, so that they form a very intricate plexus around the coeliac artery, which is named the Cceliac or Solar Plexus. From the Coeliac Plexus, there proceed other se- condary plexuses formed also of ganglia and con- necting filaments. These secondary plexuses surround the branches of the aorta, and accompany them in their distribution to the several organs in the abdomen and pelvis. Their names are derived from the arteries which they accompany, hence they arc distinguished into the Diaphragmatic, Coronary Stomachic, Hepa- tic, Splenic, Superior Mesenteric, Inferior Mesenteric,

70 perineum, while some of them are irregularly scat- tered in the surrounding cellular tissue. Two other muscles are met with in this dissection, the Levator Ani and Coccygeus. When the fat is removed which fills the deep hollow between the edge of the glutaeus maximus and the rectum, we â€™ bring into view a thin stratum of muscular fibres passing downwards from within the pelvis by the side of the gut. These constitute the Levator Ani. A partial view, however, of this muscle, can only be gained at present, its further demonstration belongs to the dissection of the pelvic viscera. It has its origin high up within the pelvis from the posterior surface of the os pubis, and from the aponeurotic expansion covering the obturator internus muscle. The fibres thence proceed downwards by the side of the prostate gland, the neck of the bladder, and the rectum. At their termination, part of the fibres are received in front between the fibres of the sphincter and the longi- tudinal fibres of the rectum, and part are continued to the back of the gut, where they meet the fibres of the opposite muscle, and arc connected with them by the intervention of a white line. There are yet other fibres of the levator ani which arc connected with the side of the os coccygis. The Coccygeus is a small muscle placed deeply inwards between the edge of the gluteus maximus and the levator ani. It arises from the spine of the

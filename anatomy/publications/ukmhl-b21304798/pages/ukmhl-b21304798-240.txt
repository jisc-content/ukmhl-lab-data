204 situation the Pleura Costalis. From the lower- most ribs, the pleura is continued upon the upper surface of the diaphragm, giving to it the same smooth covering as to the other walls of the chest. From the back parts of the ribs the pleura is ex- tended to the sides of the dorsal vertebra;, and then continues its course forwards to the pulmonary vessels at the posterior part of the root of the lung. The passage of the pleura from the sides of the vertebra; to the posterior part of the lung is easily seen by drawing the lung out of the chest, and pressing it tosvards the opposite side, so as to permit a full view of the back part of the cavity. The pleura thus reaching the lung is continued over every part of the organ, and closely adhering to it, con- stitutes the smooth covering denominated the Pleura Pulmonalis. From the front of the lung the pleura is again continued to the pulmonary vessels, and thence passes forwards to the under surface of the sternum, where our description com- menced. Each pleura, as it proceeds forwards to the under surface of the sternum, is connected with the sides of the pericardium, which is thus included between the two pleura;. Immediately in front of the ])ulmonary vessels, the two pleura; come in contact, and from this point, in their course forwards to the sternum, they gradually diverge so as to leave a tri- angular space between them. We have already seen that the mediastinum is a

169 nerves. It leaves the skull at the foramen jugulare, and proceeds downwards and forwards immediately below the stylo-pharyngeus, and then passes between this muscle and the stylo-glossus to the tongue. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve gives off in its course to the tongue, many filaments to the stylo-pharyngeus and constrictor muscles of the pharynx. When the nerve reaches the tongue it divides into many filaments which penetrate the muscular substance of the organ, and are distributed }<rin- cipally to the mucous membrane, extending from the back of the tongue to the epiglottis, a few filaments only are distributed to the muscular fasciculi them- selves'T" When the genio-hyoideus is reflected from the jaw, two other muscles of the tongue are brought into view, viz., the genio-hyo-glossus and the hyo- glossus. The Genio-Hyo-Glossus is a broad and radiated muscle situated beneath the genio-hyoideus, and be- tween the tongue, lower jaw, and os hyoides. It arises by a small tendon from the inside of the lower jaw above the origin of the genio-hyoideus. Its fibres thence diverge in such a radiated manner, as to give to the muscle an increase of breadth as it proceeds to the under and middle part of the tongue, where it is attached all the way from the basis to the apex of this organ. Some of the posterior fibres are also fixed to the lesser cornu of the os hyoides. I

197 K 3 conlinued down the arm, and arriving at the lower margin of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, it ac- quires the name of Brachial. Immediately below the axillary artery, is the axillary vein when in a collapsed state, but if distended, is almost completely in front of it. In front of the artery, one or two small nerves are generally seen crossing it in an oblique direction, the rest of the axillary plexus are placed behind it. Around the artery, as i^ approaches the inside of the arm, the nerves are so arranged, that with the connecting cellular tissue, they form a complete sheath for the vessel. The Branches of the Axillary Artery are, the Superior Thoracic, the Inferior Thoracic, the Thoracica Humeraria, the Thoracica Alaris, the Infra-Scapular, the Posterior Circumflex, and the Anterior Circumflex. 1. The Superior, or Short Thoracic, which ascends from its origin, and turns over the upper border of the pectoralis minor, where it divides into branches which are distributed to the surrounding muscles. 2. The Inferior, or Long Thoracic, some- times denominated the External Mammary, descends behind the pectoralis minor along the side of the chest, distributing its branches to the surrounding muscles which communicate with the branches of the internal mammary, and with the branches of the in- tercostal arteries perforating the intercostal mus- cles.

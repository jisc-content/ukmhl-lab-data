64 I nerves will be brought into view. It is formed by branches of the five lumbar nerves, and is placed close to the sides of the vertebrae, in front of their transverse processes, and behind the psoas magnus muscle. It distributes many small branches, some of which pass outwards upon the iliacus internus to be distributed to the abdominal muscles ; others descend beneath Poupartâ€™s ligament into the thigh, and pene- trating the fascia lata, are distributed superficially, and lastly, others accompany the spermatic cord through the abdominal ring and terminate in the in- teguments of the groin, pubes, and scrotum. The ple.xus having given off these branches, terminates in three large nerves, the Anterior Crural, the Obtura- tor, and a N erve which descends into the pelvis to ** join the sacral plexus. The Anterior Crural Nerve, proceeding from tlie lumbar plexus, descends obliquely outwards, and covered by the outer edge of the psoas magnus toPou- part s ligament, beneath which it passes upon the conjoined mass ot the psoas and iliacus muscles into the thigh. The Obturator Nerve, descending from the plexus, proceeds obliquely forwards along the outside of the superior aperture of the pelvis to the obturator foramen, through which it is continued with the ob- turator vessels into the thigh. Here it terminates by dividing into two branches which are distributed to the triceps and other muscles adjacent.

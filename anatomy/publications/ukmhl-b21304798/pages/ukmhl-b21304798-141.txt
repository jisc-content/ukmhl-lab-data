105 into the femoral vein, at about an inch and a half be- low Poupart’s ligament. The Saphena Major re- ceives many small veins in dift’erent parts of its course. One of these, larger than the rest, frequently pro- ceeds some way up the inside of the thigh before it opens into the saphena. Absorbent Glands, from six to eight in num- ber, are disposed in clusters about the upper part of the thigh, near the termination of the vena sa- phena. Absorbent vessels pass up the front of the thigh, and terminate in these glands. The vessels, however, are seldom discernible, except when they arc distended by fluid in anasarcous subjects. These absorbent glands, vessels and nerves, are enclosed between irregular layers of cellular tissue, forming altogether a dense covering, immediately be- neath the integuments, which has been described by the name of Fascia Superficialis of the thigh, although it has, in fact, nothing of a tendinous struc- ture. When the Fascia Superficialis is removed, the Fascia Lata, which binds down the muscles, is brought into view. It extends entirely round the thigh, but is not of equal thickness throughout. It is very thick on the outer side, not so thick at the back part and in front, and towards the inner side of the thigh it becomes so thin that it almost loses the appearance of tendinous structure, resembling com- mon cellular tissue, and requiring, on that account, a very careful dissection to demonstrate it.

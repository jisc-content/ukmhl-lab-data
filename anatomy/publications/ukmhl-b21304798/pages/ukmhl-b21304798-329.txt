293 • the inner side of the biceps, and upon the brachialis intcrnus to the front of the elbow joint. The brachial artery is found immediately beneath the fascia, and is surrounded by a sheath of condensed cellular tissue, which also includes the Vense Comites, the Median Nerve, and the Basilic Vein. The Ven£B Comites arc two in number, one placed close to each side of the artery. The Median Nerve, in the upper part of the arm, lies in front of the artery, but as it descends, passes to its inner 3 side. The Vena Basilica is also found on the inner side of the artery, and rather in front of the Median Nerve. The principal branches of the brachial artery are the Profunda Superior, Profunda Inferior, and Ramus Anastomoticus. 1. The Profunda Superior arises from the in- side of the trunk, near the lower edge of the teres major, and bends backwards between the long head of the triceps and the os humeri. It then winds ob- liquely round the bone to its outer side and lower part, and ends in branches, which are distributed about the external condyle, and communicate with the Recurrens Radialis from the forearm. The profunda superior is sometimes a branch of the infra-scapulary, or of the posterior circumflex arteries. Occasionally there are two branches hav- ing the course of the profunda superior. 2. The Profunda Inferior arises from the in- side of the trunk below the profunda superior, and

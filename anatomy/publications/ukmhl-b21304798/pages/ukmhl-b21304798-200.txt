164 ascends obliquely forwards behind the clavicle, and through the triangular space loft between the oppo- site margins of the mastoid and trapezius muscles. It then crosses obliquely beneath the mastoid, and when it reaches the outer edge of the sterno-hyoidcus, proceeds directly upwards, and is attached to the os hyoides just at the union of its basis and cornu. The omo-hyoideus is tendinous to an extent that varies in different subjects in the situation where it crosses beneath the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. When the sterno-hyoideus is reflected from the os hyoides downwards, the next muscle brought into view immediately beneath, is The Sterno^Thyroideus, which is a shorter and broader muscle than the sterno-hyoidcus. It arises from the posterior'part of the sternum, below the origin of the sterno-hyoideus, and sometimes from the cartilage of the second rib, and proceeding directly upwards, is attached to the oblique line which extends across the ala of the thyroid cartilage. The filaments of the nonus descendens nerve are now seen distributed to the fibres of the sterno^ thyroideus. The sterno-thyroidei being detached from the thyroid cartilage, and turned downwards, immediately beneath them is seen the thyroid gland. The Thyroid Gland is situated upon the sides of the larynx, and upon the upper part of the trachea, and is united to these parts by loose cellular tissue. The size of the gland varies considerably in dift'erent

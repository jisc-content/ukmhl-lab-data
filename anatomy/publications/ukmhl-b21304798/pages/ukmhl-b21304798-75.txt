39 inosculating with a branch of the colica sinistra, which is derived from the inferior mesenteric. 2. Colica Dextra, which passes across be- tween the layers of the mesocolon to the ascending colon, and divides sooner or later into two branches. One of these joins a branch of the ilio-colica, which is next to be described, and the other Joins the branch of the colica media Just mentioned. 3. Ilio-Colica, which proceeds across the me- socolon towards the ccecum, giving otf a branch which communicates with the colica dextra, and other branches which are distributed to the ccecum and last portion of the ilium. From the convexities ofUhe arches formed by the communications between the three arteriae coHcae, there proceed numerous parallel branches which di- vide and surround the large intestine. Sometimes there are only two arteriae colicas, in which case one of them divides to supply the branch which is wanting. From the convex side of the superior mesenteric arch, there proceed from twelve to twenty branches for *^^he supply of the jejunum and ilium. Each branch soon divides into two, which form arches by their communications with the adjacent branches. From the convexities of these arches, other branches â€¢ arise, w hich divide and re-communicate in a similar manner. The arteries at length reaching the intes- tines, ramify round them so as to form a vascular net-work between their coats.

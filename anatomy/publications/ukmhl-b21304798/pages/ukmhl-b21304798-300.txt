264 The Levator Palati. It arises from the under part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and pro- ceeding from its origin obliquely downwards and in- wards, terminates by expanding into the middle of the soft palate. By separating the side of the pharynx from the pterygoideus internus muscle, which is attached to the inside of the ramus of the lower jaw, there will be brought into view, The CiucuMFLEXUs, or Tensor Palati mus- cle, which arises from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and from a fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone. It pro- ceeds downwards along the inside of the ptery- goideus internus, and ends in a thin tendon, which contracts itself, and turns round the hook at thq extremity of the internal pterygoid plate. The tendon then proceeds horizontally inwards to the middle of the palate, where it is expanded, and is joined to the tendon of the opposite muscle. It will be recollected, that after the description of the masseter and temporal muscles, it was men- tioned that there w'ere two other muscles of the lower jawq the Ptcrygoidei, which would be more conveniently examined in the present dissection. The Pterygoideus Internus is situated on the inside of the ramus of the lower jaw'. It arises from the whole surface of the pterygoid fossa, and descending outwards and backwards, is attached to

236 cular fibres beneath. The origins of tlie temporal muscle are, from the temporal ridge, and from the temporal fossa formed by the frontal, temporal, sphenoidal, and malar bones ; from the inside of the zygoma; and, lastly, from the inner surface of the aponeurosis just described. The fibres descend from these origins between the zygoma and the side of the skull, and terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the coronoid process of the lower jaw. The masseter muscle must be removed before the insertion of the temporal muscle can be seen, when the ten- don of the latter will be observed to surround the co- ronoid process almost completely, so as to include it in a sort of sheath. There are two other muscles belonging to the lower jaw, denominated the Pterygoidei. These will be more conveniently examined after the dissec- tion of the muscles of the Pharynx.

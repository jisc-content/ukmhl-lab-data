168 wards is attached partly to the basis, and partly to the cornu of the os hyoides. In front of the larynx is found another small muscle covering the cricoid cartilage. This is The CricO'Thyroideus, which arises from the front and side of the cricoid cartilage, and proceeding obliquely upwards and outwards, is at- tached to the lower border and inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. When the stylo-hyoideus is reflected from its origin, two other muscles are brought into view, which arise from the styloid process, viz., the stylo- pharyngeus and stylo-glossus. The Stylo-Pharyngeus arises from the styloid process near its root, and proceeding inwards and backwards to the side of the pharynx, terminates partly by being intermixed with the libres of the Con- strictor muscles, and partly by an attachment to the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage. The Stylo-GLosses arises from the styloid pro- cess near its point, and Irom the ligament which ex- tends from this process to the angle of the jaw. It proceeds downwards, and at the same time forwards and inw'ards to the side of the tongue, where its fibres terminate by being intermixed with the fibres of the hyo-glossus muscle. 'i'hc Glosso-PharynCtEal Nerve is seen in con- tact with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. This nerve forms one of the divisions of the eighth pair of the cerebral

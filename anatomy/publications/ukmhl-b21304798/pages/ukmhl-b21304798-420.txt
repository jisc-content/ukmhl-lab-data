584 corpus callosum, and the two cavities arc separated by a partition, named the Septum Lucidum. The ventricles, beginning in the anterior lobes, proceed backwards in a direction parallel to each other. To- wards the posterior part of the brain, they diverge, and gradually bending first downwards and then for- wards, follow a direction which has been considered to resemble the windings of a ramâ€™s horn. Just at the point where each ventricle begins to bend downwards, an elongation of the cavity is continued almost horizontally backwards into the posterior lobe, and terminates in a pointed form. This is named either the Posterior Horn of the ventricle, or the Digital Cavity. That portion of the ventricle continued downwards and forwards is named the Inferior, the Descending, or the Reflected Horn ; and the commencement of the ventricle in front, is named the Anterior Horn. The AT'ntricles are lined throughout by a fine transparent membrane, which gives them a polished appearance. This membrane is the source of the fluid which moistens their opposite sides, and pre- serves them distinct from each other. d'he Septum Lucidum forms, as already stated, a partition between the lateral ventricles. It consists of two layers ot white substance, dcscendin<y from the under surface of the corpus callosum to the For- nix, which will next be described. Between these layers, there is a small space, which is named the Fifth Ventricle, or Ventricle of the Septum

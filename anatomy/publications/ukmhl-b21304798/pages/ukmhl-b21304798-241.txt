205 partition dividing the chest into a right and left ca- vity, and formed by the apposition of the two pleurae in the centre. When the sternum is raised in the manner already described, the mediastinum ap- pears. But it may be well to mention, that the me- diastinum is most advantageously viewed when the sternum is left entire, and the cartilages of the ribs are taken away on each side; for thus, that part of the mediastinum which is between the front of the pulmonary vessels and the under surface of the sternum is allowed to preserve its natural connexions. The mediastinum does not preserve a strait direc- tion beneath the middle of the sternum in its whole length ; but if it be traced from above downwards, it is observed to pass obliquely from the right towards the left side. In some subjects, however, it has been seen to descead strait beneath the middle of the sternum, and, in a very few instances, inclining from the left to the right side; The mediastinum is generally distinguished into an anterior and a posterior division. W'ithin the anterior division of the mediastinum are contained; above, the Subclavian Veins and Vena Cava Superior, the Arch of the Aorta, and branches proceeding from it, and generally in the early periods of life some re- mains of the part called the thymus, which is pe- culiar to the foetus; and below, the heart and peri- cardium. Between these parts and the under sur- face of the sternum, a large quantity of loose cellular tissue intervenes, io which there arc se-

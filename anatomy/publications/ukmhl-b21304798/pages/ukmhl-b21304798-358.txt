340 There are three ligaments and a synovial membrane uniting each rib to the transverse process of the cor- responding vertebra. The Ligamentum Transversum Externum is a strong ligament arising from the extremity of the transverse process of the vertebra, and proceeding horizontally outwards, is attached to the rough surface upon the tubercle of the rib. The Ligamentum Cervicis Costaf Internum arises from the lower part of the transverse process of the vertebra, and descends obliquely to the neck of the rib immediately below it. The Ligamentum Cervicis Costae Externum is situated upon the back part of the rib. It arises from the root of the transvere process of the vertebra, and descending obliquely in an opposite direction to the ligament last described, is inserted into the upper edge of the neck of the rib. The Synovial Membranes covering the cartila- ginous surfaces of the transverse processes and tu- bercles of the ribs are very distinct, and more loose than those belonging to the articulations of the heads of the ribs. The Cartilages of the ribs, at their costal extremities, present convex surfaces which arc very closely united with the concave surfaces in the extremities of the bones. The sternal ends of the cartilages of the seven true ribs present convex articular surfaces which are adapted to the hollows in the lateral edge of the sternum. These hollows are covered by cartilage

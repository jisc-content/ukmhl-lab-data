171 only by the mucous membrane. On its outer side, it is sometimes connected with the portion of the sub- .. maxillary gland which is continued beneath the mylo-hyuidcus. 'fhe excretory ducts of ihe sublingual ^ gland are variously arranged. Sometimes there is but one large duct which joins the duct of the sub- maxillary gland. In other instances, several small ducts arise from the sublingual gland, and penetrate the mucous membrane of the mouth by the side of the freenum of the tongue. The Hypo-Glossal Nerve forms the ninth pair of the cerebral nerves. Loa'^â€™ing the skull at the anterior condyloid hole, it proceeds obliquely down- wards and forwards beneath the posterior portion of the digastricus, and the stylo-hyoidcus. Be- coming gradually more superficial as it descends, it turns upwards beneath the tendon of the digastricus, so as to form a sort of loop with its convexity down- wards. The nerve then proceeds between the mylo- hyoideus and hyo-glossus to the tongue. In this course, it gives off many filaments of communication with the other nerves in the upper part of the neck, and from the convexity of its loop, a considerable branch arises, denominated The Nonus Descendens, which proceeds strait down the neck in front of the carotid artery, some- times within the cellular sheath of the jugular vein, carotid artery, and par vagum, and sometimes without, and in front of it. The nonus descendens distributes its filaments principally to the sterno-thyroideus I 2

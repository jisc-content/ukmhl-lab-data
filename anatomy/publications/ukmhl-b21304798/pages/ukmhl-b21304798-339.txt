303 margin of the groove in the os humeri, which lodges the tendon of the biceps muscle. The tendons of the teres major and latissimus dorsi are closely connected, and a bursa mucosa is found between them just before their insertion. , The whole of the internal surface of the scapula is occupied by The SuBSCAPULARis muscle. Its fibres arising from the concave surface of the scapula, converge towards the neck of the bone, and teiâ€™rainate in a tendon which passes beneath the coracoid process, and upon the capsule of the shoulder-joint, to which it is firmly united, and is attached to the lesser tuberosity of the os humeri. This muscle is formed of large fasciculi separated by aponeurotic fibres. A bursa mucosa is found between its tendon and the under part of the coracoid process. ORIGINS AND INSERTIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE UPPER ARM. The Biceps Flexor Cubiti has two distinct heads; one, the short head, arises tendinous from the coracoid process of the scapula where it is con- nected with the coraco-brachialis, and descending along the arm, soon becomes fleshy. The other, the long head, arises by a distinct tendon from the upper edge of the glenoid cavity, and then turning over the head of the humerus, proceeds downwards through the bicipital groove between the tendons of

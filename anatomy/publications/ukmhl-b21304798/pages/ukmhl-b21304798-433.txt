597 brain is described as its origin. The nerves of the brain are double, hence they are described in pairs, each pair comprising the corresponding nerves on the right and left sides. The nerves pass out of the skull through apertures in the dura mater which are found immediately above the several openings in the bones. The first pair of nerves is the Olfactory. Each Olfactory nerve arises from the under and back part of the anterior lobe of the cerebrum, near the fissura Sylvii, by three roots, two of which are formed of white substance, and the third of grey substance. From its origin, the nerve proceeds forwards beneath the anterior lobe in a groove between the convolutions. After a course of about an inch and a half, it swells into an oval bulb of a grey colour, and very soft consistence. From this bulb, there arise numerous small filaments, which immediately pass through the holes in the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone, to be distributed upon the pituitary membrane of the nose. The second pair of nerves is the Optic. Each Optic nerve has been generally considered to arise from the posterior and inferior part of the eminence in the lateral ventricle, which is denominated the Thalamus Opticus. Some anatomists, however, refer its origin to one of the eminences named the nates. The nerve forms a flattened band which turns round the crus cerebri, and advancing forwards, gra- dually approaches the nerve of the opposite side. This part of its course is named the Tractus

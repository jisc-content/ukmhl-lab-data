200 clavicle the vein is placed immediately below and rather in front of the axillary artery ; and in the neck, the vein is situated quite in front of the subclavian artery, the scalenus anticus intervening. The axil- lary veiri receives branches corresponding to the ramifications of the axillary artery, and just before it passes beneath the clavicle, it usually receives the cephalic vein, which may terminate either in the axillary vein itself, or in one of the branches leading to it. The subclavian vein receives in the neck, the external and internal jugular veins. The termination of the latter takes place just as the subclavian Yjein enters the chest. The Axillary Plexus of Nerves, is formed by the union of the anterior branches of the four last cervical nerves, with the first dorsal nerve, which is seen ascending from the chest. These five nerves mutually giving and receiving branches, thus form a plexus of considerable breadth, which is situated at its commencement between the scaleni, and is covered in front by the scalenus anticus. From beneath this muscle, the plexus proceeds obliquely downwards and outwards between the subclavius muscle and the first rib, and then continues its course in the same direction beneath the pectoral muscles into the axilla. In the neck, the plexus is placed above and rather behind the subclavian artery, and below the clavicle, it is situated behind the axillary artery and vein. The branches which the axillary plexus gives off are

162 where they form a projection in the male subject, denominated Pomum Adami. In the female, the two aUe are more widely separated, and less oblique at their union, so that the projection of the Pomum Adami docs not exist. From the upper and back part of each ala of the thyroid cartilage, a process rises upwards, which is denominated the suj)crior cornu. From the lower and back part of each ala, a similar but shorter process descends, named the inferior cornu. Below the thyroid cartilage is the second cartilage of the larynx, denominated the Cricoid Carti- lage, from its annular figure. It is narrow in front, w'here it is placed immediately below' the thyroid, while at the sides and back part its breadth is considerably increased. In its external surface, the cricoid cartilage is every where convex. Three other cartilages enter into the composition of the larynx, viz., the Two Arytenoid Carti- lages, of small size, situated at the back part of the larynx upon the upper edge of the cricoid car- tilage; and the Epiglottis placed vvithin the \ larynx at its upper part, and just below the root of the tongue. Below the larynx is the Trachea, continued from the cricoid cartilage dow'n the front of the neck into the chest. The trachea is a tube partly of a cartilaginous, and partly of a membranous struc- ture. In front and at the sides it is cylindrical, and

192 lower and front part of the subclavian, just before its passage between the scaleni, and entering the chest, proceeds downwards, iinniediauly beneath the car- tilages of the ribs. Having reached the cartilage of the seventh rib, it penetrates the diaphragm, and then ramifying between the abdominal muscles, is distributed principally to the rectus, and communi- cates with the branches of the epigastric and lumbar arteries. In this • course, the internal mammary gives off (а) Branches to the muscles of the neck, to the thymus, pericardium, a))d other parts in the chest. (б) One small branch, denominated Comes hservi Phrenici, accompanying the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm, where it communicates with the phrenic arteries derived from the aorta. (c) Branches which pass out of the chest through the intervals between the' ribs, to be distributed to the mamma, and to the muscles covering the front of the chest, where they communicate with the intercostal and thoracic arteries. ✓ 2. The Inferior Thyroid arises from the front of the subclavian. It first proceeds upwards and out- wards, but soon bends transversely inwards between the carotid artery, and the spine, and then ascends in a very tortuous course to the thyroid gland, where it ends in branches, which ramify through the gland, and communicate with the other thyroid arteries. 'I'he inferior thyroid usually gives off’ in its course to the thyroid gland, the following branches.

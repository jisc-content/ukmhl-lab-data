286 distinct in the neck, and are sometimes scarcely to be seen between the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebi'ae. The Intertransversales are short muscles ex- tended between the transverse processes of the cer- vical, dorsal, and lumbar vertebras. They are not found between the transverse processes of the two or three upper dorsal vertebrae. Upon the reflection of the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi, twelve small muscles are seen ex- tended between the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae and the ribs. These are The Levatores Costarum. Each muscle aris- ing from the extremity of the transverse process of the dorsal vertebra, proceeds obliquely downwards, expanding in breadth, and is inserted into the upper " border of the next rib. Some of the fibres are fre- quently continued downwards, over the next rib, to be inserted into the rib below it. It must be remarked, that the attachments of the muscles of the back, will not, in every instance, ex- actly correspond with the description which has been here given of them. If they are dissected in several subjects, considerable variations will be found in the number of vertebrae or ribs to which each muscle may be fixed, and the lines of separation between them are not so distinctly marked as between the muscles in other parts of the body.

206 veral absorbent glands. Within the posterior divi- sion of the mediastinum are contained the Pul- monary Vessels, the trachea with the commence- ment of the bronchi, the oesophagus, the aorta, the two nerves of the eighth pair, the vena azygos, the thoracic duct, and several absorbent glands. Of the Lungs. In the living body the lungs ac- curately fill the cavity on each side of the chest ; but after death, when the chest is opened, the lungs suffer a diminution in their bulk, greater or less in proportion to the quantity of fluids contained within them. Thus they will be observed to recede from the walls of the chest in a less degree when they are loaded with blood, or other fluid increasing their na- tural solidity. The lungs as necessai'ily moulded to the form of the cavities which they fill, are conical, with their broadest part downwards, and their narrowest up- wards. From the inclination of the heart to the left side, there is less space for the base of the left than for that of the right lung, and the latter is con- sequently the broadest. Each lung corresponding on its external side to the walls of the chest, is con- vex in its whole extent, and on its internal side each lung is flattened. The bronchus, pulmonary vessels, and nerves, enter the lung on its internal flattened side, pot exactly in the middle, but rather towards the upper and back part. The term root of the lung refers to that part of the organ where it is penetrated by the vessels and nerves. The basis of âœ“

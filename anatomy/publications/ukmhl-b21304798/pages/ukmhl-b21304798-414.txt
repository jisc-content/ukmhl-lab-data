378 to the concavity of the skull, and it is along this convex border that the superior longitudinal sinus is formed by the separation of the dura mater into laminre, which constitute the external boundaries of the sinus. The lower border of the falx is concave, and is separated into layers, which foi'm the bounda- ries of the Inferior Longitudinal Sinus. The Tentorium Cerebelli is extended across the back part of the skull, between the posterior lobes of the Cerebrum, and the two hemispheres of the Cerebellum, and is continued forwards on each side as far as the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The posterior border of the tentorium is sepa- rated into layers which form the Lateral Sinuses, and are attached to the margins of the grooves in the occipital bone in which these sinuses are lodged. The Falx Cerebelli is situated between the hemispheres of the Cerebellum, and is of a triangular figure. It begins broad from the under and middle part of the tentorium, and descends along the spine of the occipital bone to the foramen magnum, in the sides of which it is lost. The situation of the Superior Longitudinal Sinus is known by the groove which marks its course, beneath the middle of the frontal bone, along the line of union between the parietal bones, and down the middle of the occipital bone, until it is con- tinued into the two lateral grooves which mark the course of the Lateral Sinuses. The Longitudinal Sinus is to be opened in its whole length, when it

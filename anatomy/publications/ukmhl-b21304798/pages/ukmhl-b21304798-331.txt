295 o 4 the biceps muscle. From the upper part of the arm, it continues its course upwards, between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, and then turns inwards into the space between the lower border of the clavicle and the pectoralis minof muscle, to ter- minate either in one of the branches leading to the axillary vein, or immediately into the axillary vein itself. The Ven^ Comites, or Satellites, are two branches placed close to the brachial artery, one on each side. They terminate above in the axillary vein. The venous trunks just described are formed by the union of the veins of the fore-arm, which are dis- tinguished into the superficial, ramifying between the integuments and fascia, and the deep-seated, accom- panying the arteries. The superficial veins of the forearm are very numerous, especially on the front part. They are formed by the union of branches, which begin- ning upon the fingers and in the palm of the hand, ramify upon the back of the metacarpus and carpus^ and tlience proceed along the front and back part of the forearm, between the integuments and fascia. One branch situated between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and of the forefinger is generally denomi- nated Vena Cephalic a Pollicis, as it was con- sidered to be the commencement of the cephalic vein. Another branch, situated on the inner side of the back of the metacarpus, near the little finger, is

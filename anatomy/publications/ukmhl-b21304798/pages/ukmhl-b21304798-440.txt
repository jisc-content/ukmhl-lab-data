404 In this course, the basilar artery gives off branches to the cerebellum, and at its termination, divides into two branches, named the Posterior Cerebral Arteries, which distribute their ramifications to the surrounding parts of the brain. Very soon after their origin, the Posterior Cerebral Arteries receive the Communicating Branches of the Internal Carotids. By the communications which thus take place between the two internal carotids and the basilar arteries, and between the two anterior cerebral branches of the caro- tids, a chain of communicating vessels is formed at the basis of the brain, which is denominated the Cir- cle of Willis. OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN AND SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. The Veins of the brain proceed to the pia mater, as it has been already stated. From the pia mater, they proceed to the several sinuses of the dura mater. The Sinuses thus constitute the venous trunks, through which the blood, returning from the brain and its membranes, is conveyed into the internal jugular veins. The sinuses are formed by the sepa- ration of the dura mater into layers, which are so disposed as to leave spaces between them, for the most part of a triangular form. The laminae of the dura mater, thus forming the external boundaries of the sinuses, are lined by a smooth membrane of the

The ditl'crent parts of the tircthra are napnecl in the following manner;—That portion which is within the pr«)state, forming about an inch of the canal, is teniicil the prostatic part. 'I'hat portion which is incluclid between the ]irostate and bulb, being also about an inch in extent, the membranous ]>art; and the rest of the canal, frory the inetnbranoiis part to its termination, fornfing the other seven inches, the. sp(;n?y ))ortion.

'i’he dilatation in the glans is named the fossa navicularis. T ho itarrowest part of the canal is usually at the point of union between the bulb and the membranous portion. ' In the dissection of the urethra we meet with CowrKii’s Glands, which are two small bodies about the size of peas, but more or less distinct in dilVerent subjects.

24 When the lesser omentum reaches the small arch of the stomach, its two layers separate and are con- tinued, one over the anterior, the other beneath the posterior surface of the stomach, to the line of its great arch, where they arc again connected by cellular tissue. 'Iâ€™he stomach thus receives a complete perito- neal covering. The continuation of the peritoneum beneath the posterior surface of the stomach, cannot, however, be seen, until by dissection the organ is separated from the adjacent viscera. From the great arch of the stomach, a broad por- tion of peritoneum, consisting of several layers of the membrane, connected by adipose and cellular tissue, is extended downwards loosely in the abdomen, in front of the small intestines. This is the Great Omentum, which will be hereafter more particu- larly described. The Spleen is placed in the back part of the left hypochondrium, bctw'cen the great end of the stomach, and that part of the diaphragm attached to the insides of the tenth and eleventh ribs. The sto- mach must be drawn a little aside, in order to bring the spleen into view. The figure of the spleen is very irregular. Generally it is of an oval, or ellip- tical shape. Its external surface, which is opposite to the inside of the ribs, is convex; and its internal surface, which is opposite to the great end of the stomach, is concave.

The Pterygoideus Externus is placed more deeply towards the basis of the skull, where it extends obliquely across from the pterygoid process to the condyle of the lower jaw. It arises from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, from the ad- jacent part of the os palati, and from the sphenoid bone near the temporal fossa ; and proceeding from these origins obliquely outwards and backwards, is attached to a depression in the front of the condyle, and to the interarticular cartilage of the lower jaw.

425 derably. In some instances, it is nearly half an inch broad, and in others, is merely a slightly projecting ridge. Its convex border is attached to the circum- ference of the opening of the vena cava. Its concave border is loose in the cavity of the auricle, and is fre- quently perforated by several apertures. One sur- face of the valve is turned towards the opening of the Vena Cava, and the other towards the cavity of the auricle. We may here mention that in the foetus, the Eustachian Valve is proportionally larger than in the adult; hence anatomists are of opinion, that its office is connected with the peculiarities of the foetal circu- lation. Below the Eustachian Valve, is the opening of the great Coronary Vein. Its margin is provided with a valve which is calculated to prevent any re- flux of blood from the auricle into the vein. The valve is not, however, ahvays of sufficient breadth to cover the orifice of the vein. Several smaller veins open into various parts of the right auricle. The wide opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle is denominated, either the Annulus Venosus, or the Auricular Orifice of THE V^ENTRiCLE. A white line extends around its edge, which some anatomists have stated to be of a tendinous nature. The Right Ventricle is next to be examined. Its form is triangular, w'ith its basis turned upw'ards, and joined to the auricle. On its left side, it is united to the opposite ventricle. The right ventricle is to be

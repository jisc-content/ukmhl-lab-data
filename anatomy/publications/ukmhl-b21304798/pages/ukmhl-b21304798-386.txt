350 which they close, and are then expanded upon the back part of the coccyx. Smaller bands also descend in front from the lower end of the sacrum to the coccyx. OF THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS. The opposite surfaces of the ossa pubis are very lirmly united by the intervention of fibrous laminjB and of cartilage. When a section is made of the symphysis, a distinct band of fibrous substance is seen running supeiâ€™ficially around the articulation, and beneath this superficial band, there are other fibrous laminae extending some way within the arti- culation at its upper, lower, and front parts. These laminae form the union between the ossa pubis in the situations just mentioned. Towards the back part of the articulation, the bones are covered by thin layers of cartilage, the opposite surfaces of which are moistened by a whitish fluid, and are kept closely in contact by the external ligaments of the joint. The extent of these cartilaginous surfaces varies in dif- ferent subjects. Sometimes, and especially in females, they occupy almost the whole breadth of the articu- lation, while in a few instances, no cartilage has been discovered, the bones being then united only by the fibrous luminas. The articulation between the ossa pubis is strength- ened at its lower part by ligamentous fibres passing across between the ramus of each bone, and in front. t

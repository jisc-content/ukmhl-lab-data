36 âœ“ after a course of about two inches, it divides into the Hepatica Dextra and Hepatica Sinistra. Before its di- vision, the liepatic aitcry gives off 1. Gastro-Epiploica Dextra or Gastro- Duodenalis, which is a branch of a large size. From its origin, this branch proceeds down- wards behind the commencement of the duodenum, to the great arch of the stomach, along which it is continued from the pyloric towards the great end of the organ. The gastro-epiploica dextra gives off in this course, (a) Duodenal Arteries, consisting of branches, varying in size and number, dis- tributed upon the duodenum. (b) Pancreatic Arteries, consisting of se- veral branches distributed to the pancreas. (c) Branches which arise from the horizontal portion of the gastro-epiploica dextra, and are distributed partly upon both surfaces of the stomach, and partly between the layers of the omentum. The gastro-epiploica dextra terminates by inoscu- lating with the gastro-epiploica sinistra. 2. Pylorica, which is a smaller branch than the last. It descends to the pylorus, and is then re- flected along the small arch of the stomach, distri- buting branches to the pyloric end of the organ and ending by inosculation with the coronaria ven- triculi. The Hepatica Dextra and Sinistra proceed together

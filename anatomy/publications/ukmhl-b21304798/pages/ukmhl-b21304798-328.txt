4 â€˜292 The Brachialis Interxus, placed beneath the biceps, and closely applied upon the front and sides of the os humeri at its lower part. The Triceps, consisting of the large mass of flesh occupying the whole of the back part of the arm. The muscles on the front of the arm are separated from those on the back part by two narrow slips of fascia, which are attached, one to the ridge on the side of the os humeri leading to the outer condyle ; the other to the ridge on the opposite side of the bone leading to the inner condyle. These slips are some- times denominated the External andinternal Intermus- cular Ligaments. VESSELS AND NERVES IN THE UPPER ARM. The student must in the next place proceed wiUr the dissection of the vessels and nerves which are continued from the axilla down the inside of the arm. The Brachial Artery, beginning at the lower margin of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, pro- ceeds down the inside of the arm. As it descends, it becomes more superficial, and gradually bends forwards to the front of the elbow joint. In this course the artery is first placed close to the inner side of the coraco-brachialis; then crossing the ten- dinous insertion of this muscle, it proceeds close to

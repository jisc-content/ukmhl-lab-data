377 membrane and the surrounding bones. In young subjects, these vessels are more numerous than in the adult, and the skull cap and dura mater are in con- sequence so strongly adherent, that their separation can scarcely be effected without injury to the latter. It may be remarked, that the dura mater and the sur- rounding bones are most firmly connected along the lines of the sutures. A division is now to be made of the dura intder. It should commence at any point opposite the mid- distance betwceu the vertex and basis of the br.ain. Thence it should be carried entirely round the brain except that a small portion of the membrane in front and behind should be left uncut. The membrane should then be raised from either side, whereby its internal surface will be brought into view, which is smooth and moistened by fluid. There are processes of the dura mater extending into the cranium, and separating the diflerent parts of the brain from each other. Iâ€™hese are tJie Falx Cerebri, Tentorium Cerebelli, and Falx Cerebelli. The Falx Ceucbki is extended from the front to ' the back part of the skull, between the two lateral halves or hemispheres of the cerebrum, 'i'he form of the falx is denoted by its name. Its narrow end is attached in front, to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone. Becoming gradually broader as it is extended backwards, it terminates behind, by being continued into the middle of the tentorium cerebelli.. The upper border of the falx ha.s a convexity adapted

126 The Semitendinosus, connected at its upper part with the biceps. The Semimembranosus, lying immediately be- neath the semitendinosus. The Biceps arises by two distinct heads. The one, the long head, has its origin from the tuber ischii, by a short tendon which is joined to the tendon of the semitendinosus. The other, the short head, arises between the triceps and vastus externus, from the outer side and lower part of the linea aspera, and from the oblique ridge leading to the outer condyle. The libres of the long head proceed obliquely down- wards, and unite with the short head a little above ' the knee. The muscle then continuing its course downwards, terminates in a tendon which is inserted into the outer side of the head of the fibula. The Semitendinosus arises by a tendon from the tuber ischii with the long head of the biceps, to which it is connected by fleshy fibres to the extent of two or three inches down the thigh. Then leaving the biceps, it proceeds obliquely downwards to the inside of the thigh, and soon ends in a long round tendon which passes behind the inner condyle, and is reflected forwards to be attached to the inside of the tibia, below the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis, to which it is connected by aponeurotic fibres. A white tendinous line intersects this muscle obliquely at about its middle. The Semimembranosus arises from the tuber ischii in front of the biceps and semitendinosus, by a

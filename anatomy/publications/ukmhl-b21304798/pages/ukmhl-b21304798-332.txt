dcnominaicd Vena Salvatella. As the veins )>roceed along the forearm, they divide and reunite many times, so as to form a continued plexus from the wrist to the elbow. One vein running along the front of the forearm is generally distinguished by the name of Vena Mediana. At the upper parr, the Vena Mediana divides into two branches, the Mediana Cephalica and Mediana Basilica. These proceed obliquely upwards over the elbow joint, one to the outer, the other to the inner side of the arm, where they terminate, one in the Cephalic, and the othor in the Basilic veins. The superficial veins of the forearm arc here de- scribed according to the view which is generally given of them, but it must at the same time be re- marked, that the varieties in their distribution are so numerous that they will not be found exactly alike in any two subjects. One or two Absorbent Glands of small size arc generally found on the inside of the arm, a little above the internal condyle. They lie superficially near the basilic vein. The Axillart Plexus of Nerves has been al- ready described as terminating in six nerves for the supply of the arm. The Circumflex, the E.x- TERNAL and Internal Cutaneous, the Median, the Muscular Spiral, or Radial, and the Ul- nar Nerves. The Circumflex Nerve proceeds from the plexus obliquely downwards and outwards to the

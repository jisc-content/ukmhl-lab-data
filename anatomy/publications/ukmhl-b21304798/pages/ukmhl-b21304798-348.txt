312 wards from its origin to the external condyle, and ends in communications with the branches of the brachial, especially with the profunda superior. ; 2. Muscular Branches in its whole course down the forearm. 3. The SuPERFiciALis Volx, which is subject to considerable varieties, /both in tlie place of its ori- gin, and in its size. It is usually given off just be- fore the radial turns towards the back of the hand, but occasionally, it arises much higher in the fore- ai’in. In some subjects the superficialis volse is a small branch proceeding directly to the muscles of the thumb, in which it terminates. In other in- ' stances the superficialis volm is of so large a size that it may be said to be formed by a division of the ra- dial [into two equal branches. It j^then proceeds downwards over the abductor pollicis muscle, and sometimes through a part of its fibres into the hand, where it ends in communications with the superfi- cial palmar arch, formed by the ulnar artery. 4. The Dorsales Pollicis, which are small ' branches, distributed to the back of the thumb. | 5. The Dorsalis Carpi, ramifying on the back ; of the carpus. 6. The Do vsalis Indicis, ramifying upon the ’ back of the forefinger. J 7. The Magna Pollicis, distributed principally | to the thumb. This artery is usually divided into | three branches, of which two are distributed to j the thumb, and one to the radial side of the fore-? j 1

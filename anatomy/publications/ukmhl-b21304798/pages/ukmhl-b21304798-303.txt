267 N 2 The four pieces of cartilage are united to each other, and to the edges of the surrounding bones, by a dense fibrous substance. They are covered on their internal surface by the mucous membrane of the nose, and externally by the common integu- ments. The nostrils are extended rather obliquely down- wards and backwards, from their commencement in the face to their termination in the pharynx. They are separated above from the cavity of the skull by the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone, and by the body of the sphenoid bone; hence their upper boundary is horizontal beneath the cribriform la- mella, but farther backwards, slopes obliquely downwards from the inclination of the sphenoid bone. Their lower boundary is horizontal in its whole ex- */ tent, and is formed by the palatine processes of the superior maxillary bones, and by the two palatine bones, which together separate the nose from the mouth. The lateral and external boundaries of the nostrils are formed by the os planum, or orbitar por- tion of the ethmoid bone, and by the os unguis, which together separate the nose from the orbit, also by the palatine and superior maxillary bones, and by the spongy bones, which project into the cavity of the nostril. The two nostrils are separated from each other by the septum, which is formed above, by the nasal la- mella of the ethmoid bone, below and behind, by the vomer, and in front, by a flat piece of cartilage,

188 the cephalic vein, which passes through it to open into the axillary vein. The apcnturolic fibres be- longing to the poctoralis major on each side decus- sate with each other, so as to form an expansion which covers the front of the sternum. The sternal portion of the muscle, as it approaches the os hu- meri, is folded back be neatii the edge of the clavi- cular portion, so as to give the muscle a twisted ap- pearance in this situation, where it forms the front margin of the axilla. Trom the lower part of the pectoralis major, a distinct fleshy slip is frequently extended downwards, and joins the obliquus externus muscle. The pectoralis major is to be detached from the clavicle, sternum, and ribs, and in rellccting it, many branches of the a.xillary vessels and nerves will be seen distributed t<j its under surface. '1 hese 1 are to be left connected with the muscle, as they will then be more advantageously examined in the next stage of the dissection. Beneath the pectoralis major is The Pector.ai.is Mixoti, which is a triangular I muscle of much less breadth than the preceding. It j arises by distinct digitations from the third, fourth, t and fifth ribs, near their cartilages ; and proceeding i upwards and backwards,, its fibres converge into a 1 flat tendon, which is inserted into the coracoid pro- cess, and is here connected with the coraco-brachialis and with the short head of the biceps muscle. ' A small muscle is placed obliquely bctw'cen the

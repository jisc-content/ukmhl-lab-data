396 from the tuber by a deep transverse fissure, and gra- dually contracts as it approaches the foramen mag- num, through which it is continued into the Medulla Spinalis. On the anterior side of the medulla ob- longata there are four eminences contiguous to each other. The two internal are the Corpora Pyra- MiDALiA, and the two external, the Corpora Olivaria. The groove between the corpora pyra- midalia is continuous at its lower part with the groove which divides the medulla spinalis into its right and left halves. Immediately behind the tuber annulare, and between the corpora pyramidalia, there is a small depression, which is named the Foramen Ccecum. The arachnoid membrane and pia mater are to be carefully removed from the lower part of the medulla oblongata, immediately below the corpora pyra- midalia, and the edges of the middle groove are to be gently drawn asunder, when there will be discovered four or five bands of white substance, ascending ob- liquely from one side of the medulla to the other. 'Iâ€™he bands of each side decussate, some of them passing above, and others below those of the opposite side, so that they are interwoven like plaited straw. These bands arc named the Decussating Rands of the Corpora Pyramidalia. ORIGINS OF THE NERVES OF THE BRAIN WITH THEI R COU Its E TO THE FORAMIN A THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT OF THE SKULL.

An External Lateral Ligament which is less distinct than the preceding. It arises from the ex- ternal condyle, and descending in a diverging man- ner, terminates by a broad insertion into the coronary ligament surrounding the neck of the radius. Anterior and Posterior Ligaments, con- sisting of fibrous bands extended irregularly upon the front and back part of the joint. The synovial membrane of the elbow-joint is re- flected downwards from the articular surface of the humerus upon the greater semilunar cavity of the ulna, by w'hich it is articulated w ith the humerus, and upon its lesser semilunar cavity which receives the head -of the radius ; and, lastly, it is continued upon the head and neck of the radius itself. We thus observe that the synovial membrane of the elbow is also continued into the articulation between the radius and ulna. ARTICULATIONS OF THE RADIUS WITH THE ULNA. The articulation between the head of the radius and the lesser semilunar cavity of the ulna, is secured by a strong flattened band of fibres, denominated the Orbicular, or Coronary Ligament, which sur- rounds the neck of the radius, and is attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the semilunar cavity in,the ulna. This ligament lies close upon the cap- sule of the joint, and is firmly united to it.

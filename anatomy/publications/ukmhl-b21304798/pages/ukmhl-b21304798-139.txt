103 F 4 the union of branches of the four first sacral nerves with the branch which descends from the last lum- bar nerve. The plexus is placed at the back part of the pelvis, close upon the origin of the pyriformis muscle. It will be sufficient to enumerate the branches of the plexus, which are named according to the parts they supply. They are the Glutteal, Pudendal, Haemorrhoidal, Vesical, Uterine, and ' Vaginal Nerves. The sacral plexus, having given off these branches, terminates in the Ischiatic Nerve, which descends in front of^^the pyriformis muscle and passes out of the pelvis through the lower part of the great ischiatic notch. Its further course will be described with the dissection of the lower ex- tremity. The Absorbe^jt Glands of the pelvis are very nu- merous. iSonie of them are distributed round the large blood vessi Is, and upon the sides of the bladder, uterus, and vagina; and others are found between th« layers of the meso-rcctum. »

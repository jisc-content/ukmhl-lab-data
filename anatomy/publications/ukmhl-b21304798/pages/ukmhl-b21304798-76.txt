40 The Superior Mesenteric V^ein forms an arch, and receives branches corresponding to those of the artery. The trunk of the vein ascends on the right side of the artery between the layers of the mesentery, and then passing under the meso- colon, continues its course upwards behind the pancreas, where it terminates by joining the splenic vein to form the vena portae. The mesentery, and the heap of small intestines, are now to be raised upwards and fixed in that situ- ation, in order to facilitate the dissection of .the in- ferior'mesenteric artery, which will be readily exposed by dividing the peritoneum covering the lumbar ver- tebrae towards their left sides. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery, arising from the lower part of the aorta, descends on the left sides of the lumbar vertebrae to the pelvis. Then acquiring the name of Internal Haemorrhoidal artery, it continues its course down the back part of the pelvis and behind the rectum. The inferior mesenteric artery gives off, The CoLiCA Sinistra, which passing across to the left side of the abdomen, divides into three branches. \ Two of these arc distributed to the descending colon and sigmoid flexure, and the third ascends to join the e branch of the colica media, as it has been mentioned, > ' thus forming the groat arch of communication be- tween the two mesenteric arteries. f he internal hasmorrhoidal artery will be described with the other arteries of the pelvis.

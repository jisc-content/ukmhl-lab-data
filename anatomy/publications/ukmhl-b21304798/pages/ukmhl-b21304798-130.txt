94 ture in tlie fascia transversalis, through which it is continued with the spermatic vessels to the groin. The course of tlie vagina is now to be examined. The levator ani muscle is seen passing downwards '^from the neck of the bladder by the side of the vagina to the rectum. When this muscle is turned down- wards, the vagina will be exposed, and is to be cleaned with the urethra, which is in close union with its upj)cr or anterior side. The Vagina is a membranous canal placed in the middle of the inferior aperture of the pelvis, between the bladder and urethra which are in front of it, and the rectum w-hich is behind it. The length of the vagina is between five and six inches, and its breadth about one inch. Beginning above at the neck of the uterus, it is extended rather obliquely downwards and forwards, and with a slight concavity towards the bladder and urethra, to the pudendum, where it ter- minates by an orifice which is sometimes denominated the Os Externum. The sides of the vagina are composed of a thick and firm substance, of a greyish colour, with numerous large vessels ramifying through it. The upper extremity of the vagina surrounds the neck of the uterus obliquely, so that the os uteri ap- proaches nearertothe os externum infront than behind. J he fibres of the sphincter vaginae surround the canal near its extenial orifice, and when these are removed, a spongy substance is brought into view, which also en- circles the canal. This substance is about an inch in breadth, of a dark blue colour, is composed altogether

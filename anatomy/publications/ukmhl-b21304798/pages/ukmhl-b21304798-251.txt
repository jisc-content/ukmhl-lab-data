215 ture becomes at the same time gradually less dis- tinct. The minute ramifications of the bronchi ter- minate in the air cells of the lungs. The absorbent glands of the lungs, denominated the bronchial glands, are situated closely round the bronchi, some of them extending into the sub- stance of the lung. They are numerous, and of a large size, of a rounded or oval figure, and of a dark blue or black colour. The (Esophagus, descending from the neck, continues its course through the chest, passing first behind the trachea, next obliquely behind the left bronchus. It then becomes placed in the middle line of the body, in front and on the right of the aorta. From the chest it is continued through the opening in the diaphragm into the abdomen. The Aorta proceeds from the left side of the third dorsal vertebra, where its arch terminates, in a strait course through the chest, close upon the spine, to the opening in the diaphragm, through which it passes into the abdomen. This part of the aorta, be- tween the termination of the arch and the diaphragini, is usually denominated its thoracic or descending portion. It gives ofi’ the following branches:— 1. The Bronchial Arteries, which are of small size, and vary from two to five in number. They accompany the ramifications of the bronchi through the lungs. In their course to the lungs, they distribute branches to the pericardium, aorta, bronchial glands, and pulmonary vessels.

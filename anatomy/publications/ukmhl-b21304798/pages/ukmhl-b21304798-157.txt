121 the os femoris at the upper and external part of thelinea aspera, immediately below the trochanter major. A large bursa mucosa is placed between the tendon of the V glutmus maximus and the trochanter major. When the glutseus maximus is reflected from its origins, and the portion of fascia in front of the muscle is removed, the whole of the Glutaeus Medius will then be exposed. In raising the glutaeus maximus, care is required to avoid detaching at the same time any of the small muscles beneath it. Numerous large branches of the glutaeal artery are distributed to the under surface of the glutaeus maximus, and must necessarily be divided in reflecting the muscle. The Glutaeus Medius arises from that part of the dorsum ilii which is between the crista and the semicircular ridge extending across between the ante- rior superior spine and the ischiatic notch, also from the fascia which covers it. Its fibres form a thick and triangular muscle which proceeds downwards, and ends in a tendon attached to the upper and front part of the trochanter major. The glutmus medius is to be reflected from its origin, and in doing this, care is required to avoid raising the next muscle, the Glutasus Minimus. This is situated beneath the lower part of the glutaeus medius, and closely covers the lower and front sur- face of the os innominatum. The GLUTiEus Minimus arises from the whole -surface of the dorsum ilii, below the semicircular

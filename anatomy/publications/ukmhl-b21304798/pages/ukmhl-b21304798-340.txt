304 the pectoralis major in front, and of the teres major, and latissimus dorsi, behind. Quitting the groove, the long head continues to descend, and soon becomes fleshy. The two heads are still continued separately some way downwards, until they unite about the middle of the arm. The single muscle thus formed, continues its course down the inside of the arm, and terminates at the lower part in a tendon which passes over the front of the elbow-joint, between the pro- nator radii teres, and supinator radii longus, and is then turned backwards to be attached to the tubercle of the radius. A bursa mucosa is found beneath the tendon just before its insertion. At the bend of the elbow, a broad portion of fascia arises from the inside of the tendon of the biceps, and is continued into the fascia of the forearm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps, in its passage through the shoulder- joint is on the outside of the synovial membrane, and therefore not in contact with the synovia. The mem- brane is reflected around the tendon in this situation, giving to it a polished surface. The insertion of the biceps will be seen in the dissection of the fore- arm. t _ The Coraco-Brachialis arises from the coracoid process by a tendon, which is united with the short head of the biceps, and descends along the arm, adhering some way down to the edge of the biceps. Thence passing a little obliquely backwards to the inside of the humerus, it is attached to a rough sur- face of the bone at about its middle.

190 necessary to point out three small muscles which are found in the lower part and side of the neck, before we proceed to the vessels and nerves. These three muscles are denominated the scaleni, and from their situation are distinguislied into the anticus, medius and posticus. The Scalenus Anticus arises tendinous from the external surface and upper border of the first rib, near its cartilage, and thence proceeding obliquely upwards and inwards, is attached by distinct ten- dons to the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and si^th cervical vertebrae. The Scalenus JNIedius arises from the external surface of the first rib, about half an inch from the scalenus anticus, and proceeding obliquely upwards, is attached by distinct tendons to the transverse pro- cesses of the six upper cervical vertebrae. The .Scalenus Posticus arises from the external. surface of the first rib near the spine, and some- • times from the upper border of the second rib, and ascending obliquely inwards, is attached by distinct. tendons to the transverse processes of the fifth and! sixth cervical vertebrae. In many subjects, the scalenus medius and posd- - cus are united into one muscle ; hence, by some ana- • tomists, only two scaleni are described. y

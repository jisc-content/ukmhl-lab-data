10 edge of the rectus, where they become tendinous. By tracing the tendons of the two muscles over the rectus, we find them united in their lower part, and attached to the os pubis behind the ring of the ex- ternal oblique. From the lower margin of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and from the adjacent part of Poupartâ€™s ligament, a few thinly scattered fibres are detached, which constitute The Cremaster Muscle. This proceeds from its origin obliquely downwards, and inwards to the ring of the external oblique. Passing through the ring, the cremaster continues its course directly downwards in front of the spermatic vessels into the scrotum, where its fibres terminate by being scat- tered upon the upper part of the tunica vaginalis testis. The muscle next to be dissected is The Rectus, which extends down the middle of the abdomen, occupying the space between the linea alba and linea semilunaris, and is contained, as before mentioned, within a sheath formed by the divisions of the aponeuroses of the two oblique, and of the transversalis muscles. The front of the sheath must be divided down its middle, and its internal sur- face is to be separated from the fibres of the rectus beneath, in order that the muscle may be brought , completely into view. It will then be seen arising by a flattened tendon from the upper part of the os pubis, near the symphysis, thence ascending in the

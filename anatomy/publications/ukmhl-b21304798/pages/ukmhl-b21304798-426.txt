390 front part of the third ventricle to the Pituitary Gland at the basis of the brain. The channel of communication between the third ventricle and the infundibulum, is named the Iter ad Infundi- bulum. Immediately below the posterior commissure, there is a small round opening, which is the com- mencement of a canal leading from the third ven- tricle, obliquely downwards and backwards, beneath the eminences, named the Tubercula Quadrigemina into the fourth ventricle. This canal is denominated the Canalis Medius, or Aqua;-ductus Sylvii, or Iter a tertio ad quartum Ventriculum. The lower boundary of the lateral ventricles is formed by the following parts; viz., the Corpora Striata, Thalami Optici, and Taenia Semicircularis. The Corpora Striata are two eminences of a pyriform shape. Their broadest ends are placed forwards in the anterior horns of the ventricles, whence they are continued outwards and backwards, gradually receding from each other, and contracting in breadth until they terminate in a pointed form. They are grey externally, but within, they consist of a striated intermixture of the grey and white sub- stance, from which their name has been derived. The Thalami Optici are two convex eminences placed more towards the middle and back part of the ventricles than the corpora striata. On their outer sides, the thalami are received into the concavities formed by the diverging corpora striata. The inner

The TiENiA Semicircularis is a very thin and narrow band of white substance lodged in a super- ficial groove between the corpus striatum, and thala- mus opticus on each side. There are certain objects which yet remain to be examined in the Inferior and Posterior Horn of each Lateral Ventricle. A large white prominence, named the Hippo- campus Major, or Cornu Ammonis, extends along the bottom of the inferior horn of each ven- tricle. At the extremity of the ventricle, the hippo- campus major terminates in a bulbous projection, which is marked by three or four superficial grooves presenting the appearance, named the Pes Hippo- campi. The posterior crus of the fornix, as it passes through the inferior horn of the ventricle, runs along the concave side of the hippocampus major, and adheres to it, as already stated. In the bottom of the posterior horn, or digital cavity of each ventricle, a prominence is more or less distinctly seen, which is named the Hippocampus Minor. Behind the posterior commissure, and below the pineal gland, there are four convex eminences, sepa- rated by superficial grooves. These are the Tuber- cula Quadrigemina. The two anterior emi-

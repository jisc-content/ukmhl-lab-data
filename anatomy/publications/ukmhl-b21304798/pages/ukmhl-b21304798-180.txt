144 Here it crosses tlie tendon of the flexor longus digi- torum, and proceeds to the inner side of the foot, where it is continued forwards between the two por- tions of the flexor brevis poliicis and between the two sesamoid bones to be attached to the last phalanx of the great toe. The Flexou Longus Digitorum Pedis Per- FORANS arises from the posterior flattened surface of the tibia just below the popliteus, and from the apo- neurotic partitions separating it on each side from the tibialis posticus and from the flexor longus poliicis. It proceeds downwards, having attachments to the posterior surface of the tibia to within two inches of its lower end. Here its fibres terminate obliquely in a tendon which is eontinued downwards through a superficial groove in the lower end of the tibia, and is thence reflected forwards beneath the astragalus into the sole of the foot, where it crosses the tendon of the flexor longus poliicis and then divides into four small slips. These slips proceed forwards, and become con- tained in fibrous sheaths in which they pass through the slits in the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum and are attached to the last phalanx of the four lesser toes. The tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus poliicis are connected by a cross slip of tendon in the sole of the foot. The Tibialis Posticus arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, where it begins just below the popliteus, also from the posterior surface of the fibula, from the interosseous ligament, and from the aponew-

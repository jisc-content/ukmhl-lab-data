352 urfaccs of the clavicle and sternum with which they are in contact. In some instances, the cartilage has a hole in its centre. The joint is divided by the interarticular cartilage into two parts, which are provided with distinct syno- vial membranes ; one of them covers the articular sur- face of the clavicle, and is reflected downwards upon the upper surface of the cartilage, the other covers the under surface of the cartilage, and is reflected down- wards upon the articular surface of the sternum. The clavicle is fixed to the first rib by a strong ligament which proceeds Irom the cartilage of the ribs obliquely upwards and backwards, to a rough surface in the under part of the clavicle near its sternal extremity. ARTICULATION 0>' THE CLAVICLE WITH THE SCAPULA. The scapular end of the clavicle is fixed to the articular surface in the edge of the acromion by liga- mentous fibres which extend across from one bone to the other, both above and below the articulation. An Inteuarticular Cartilage is sometimes found in this joint, but its appearance varies so con- siderably, that no exact description can be given of it. Iwo Ligaments are extended between the cla- vicle and the coracoid process of the scapula. On*

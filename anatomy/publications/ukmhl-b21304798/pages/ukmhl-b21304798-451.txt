415 T 4 The Spinal Cord commences above, at the foramen magnum, where it is continuous with the medulla oblongata, and terminates below, at the first or second lumbar vertebra. The thickness of the cord varies in its different parts between half an inch and an inch, and it is stated that the thickest parts are those where the largest number of nerves have their origin. Just before its termination, the cord swells transversely, and then gradually contracts into a point. A distinct fissure descends along the middle of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cord in its whole length. The spinal cord is formed, like the brain, of two distinct kinds of substance, one white, dnd the other grey. The arteries of the spinal cord are derived from the vertebral, inferior thyroid, intercostal, and lumbar arteries. The veins of the spinal cord unite into two trunks, which are lodged in each side of the vertebral canal along its whole length, between the dura mater and the bones. These veins are named the Vertebral Sinuses. There are numerous transverse branches of communication between the two sinuses, and there are other branches w'hich arise from each sinus, and communicate freely with the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral veins. OF THE NERVES PROCEEDING FROM THE SPINAL CORD. There arc thirty pairs of nerves arising from the

311 be remembered, that whatever may be the variety in the origins of the branches, the brachial trunk con- stantly preserves its regular course down the inside of the arm, and that whatever may be the branch given off in the high division, it always passes down the inside of the arm in company with the brachial trunk. Occasionally when the ulnar is the branch given off in the high division, it is found super- ficially above the fascia in its course to the fore arm. A large branch is sometimes given off high up from the brachial, and after running some way down the arm, it enters either the brachial trunk again, or one of its branches. The Radial Artery is situated, at its com- mencement, between the pronator radii teres and the supinator radii longus muscles, and then de- scending between these muscles, it crosses the inser- tion of the pronator teres, and continues its course down the forearm between the supinator longus and the flexor carpi radialis, and upon the flexor longus pollicis. Arriving at the lower end of the radius, the artery here turns outwards and backwards in an oblique direction, beneath the tendons of the exten- sor muscles of the thumb to the space between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and of the fore- finger, whence it penetrates into the palm of the hand. Tlie branches of the radial artery are, 1. The Recurre'ns Radialis, which turns up-

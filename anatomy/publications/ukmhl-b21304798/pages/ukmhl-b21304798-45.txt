‘ 9 B 5 of the lumbar vertebras, and to the back part of the crista ilii * ; lastly, from the outer half of Poupart’s ligament by fleshy fibres, which, as already men- tioned, are intimately united with the fibres of the in- ternal oblique. From this extent of origin, the fibres of the transversal is proceed transversely across the abdomen to the outer edge of the rectus. Here they end in an aponeurosis, which soon divides itself into two portions, a superior and inferior. The superior portion being united with the posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, passes behind the upper three-fourths of the rectus. The inferior por- tion passes in front of the lower fourth of the rectus, in company with the aponeuroses both of the internal and external oblique to the linea alba, where the aponeuroses of all the abdominal muscles. are in- termixed with each other. The sheath of the rectus, hereaftqr to be described, is formed by the divisions of these several, aponeu- roses. It must be here observed, that from the origin of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, which occupies the outer half of Poupart’s ligament, their lower margins proceed in a single mass inwards to the * The attachments of this tendon cannot be brought into view until the muscles of the back are dissected. It will then be seen passing backwards between the quadratus lura^- borura muscle and the mass of flesh forming the sacro lum- balis and longissimus dorsi muscles to the transverse pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebrae. . ‘ »

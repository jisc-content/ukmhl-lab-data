189 under surface of the clavicle and the first rib. This is The SuBCLAVius. It arises by a flattened tendon from the cartilage, and sometimes from the bone of the first rib, and proceeding obliquely outwards, and a little backwards, is attached to the groove along the under surface of the clavicle. This attachment oc- cupies the bone in its whole length except about an inch at each end. A thin aponeurotic expansion, more or less dis- tinct in different subjects, is extended across from the first rib to the coracoid process, in an arched form over the axillary vessels. ^Vhen thepectoralis minor is reflected from the ribs, we bi'ing into view a broad muscle which is expanded over the side and back pari of the chest. This is The Serra'ius Magnus. It arises by distinct digitations from the eight or nine upper ribs, at a short distance from their cartilages; and proceeding upwards and backwards, is attached to the basis of the scapula in its whole length, between the insertions of the rhomboideus and subscapularis muscles. In the present stage of the oisscction, only that part of the serratus magnus can bo seen, which covers the side of the chest. The greater part of the muscle is concealed between the scapula and ribs, and will be more ad\antageoubly seen after the dissection of the muscles of the back. The dissection of the muscles, covering the front and side of the chest, is here concluded, but it is still

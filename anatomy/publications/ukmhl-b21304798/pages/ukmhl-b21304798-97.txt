61 through the abdomeli on the right side of the vertebral column. Reaching the back part of the under sur- face of the liver, the vena cava passes through a groove in its substance between the right lobe and the lobulus Spigelii. From the back part of the liver the vena cava passes through the aperture in the central tendon of the diaphragm into the chest, where it is immediately invested by the pericardium and termi- nates in the right auricle of the heart. The principal branches which the vena cava inferior receives are, 1. The Lumbar Veins, which are usually four on each side. They proceed transversely across the bodies of the vertebrae with the corresponding arteries. 2. The Spermatic Veins, which ascend upon the psoas magnus muscle in company with the spermatic arteries. Each spermatic vein, as it ascends upon the psoas, divides itself into branches which re-unite into a sort of plexus. The right sper- matic vein usually terminates in the vena cava a little below the renal vein, and the left usually opens into the renal vein itself, 3. The Renal Veins, which are of very large size, and formed by the union of many branches arising from different parts of the kidneys. Each renal vein proceeds transversely across to the vena cava. The left renal vein passes in front of the aorta, and is the longest in consequence of the greater distance between the vena cava and the left kidney. 4. The Capsular Veins, which are two in num- i

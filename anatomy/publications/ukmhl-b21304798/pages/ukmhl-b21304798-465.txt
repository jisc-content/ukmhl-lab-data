429 is a canal of communication between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. We now proceed to the examination of the left side of the heart, beginning with the auricle. The Left Auricle is of a very irregular figure. From its upper part and right side, an Appendix, similar to that of the right auricle, extends transversely upon the basis of the ventricle. An incision is to be t made through the upper part of the auricle, and in such a direction as to leave the pulmonary veins un* injured. The internal surface of the left auricle is smooth, except within the appendix, where there are muscular fasciculi, but of smaller size and less nu- merous than in the appendix of the right auricle. On the inner side of the left auricle is an oval depression, but less distinct than in the opposite auricle, and sometimes it is altogether wanting. In the upper and back part of the Left Auricle, are the openings of the Four Pulmonary Veins. The two from the right lung terminate in the right side of the auricle, and the two from the left terminate opposite to them. The right pulmonary veins open into the auricle at some distance from each other, while the left open near to each other, and sometimes terminate by a common orifice. Tfie opening of communication between tlie Left Auricle and Ventricle, is named the Auricular Orifice of the Left Ventricle. It is rather less in diameter than the corresponding orifice of the opposite side. Around the edge of the opening, there is a white line similar to that on the right side of the heart.

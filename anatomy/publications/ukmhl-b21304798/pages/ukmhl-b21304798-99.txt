63 larger than in other parts of its course. The thoracic duct is placed first behind the aorta, then ascending a little to the right, is placed between the aorta and the right crus of the diaphragm, and thus passes from the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The Sympathetic Nerve consists in the abdomen of four or five ganglia connected by slender filaments which are placed along the sides of the lumbar ver- tebrae in front of the origins of the psoas magnus. The uppermost of these lumbar or abdominal ganglia is connected with the last ganglion of the sympathetic in the chest by a filament which passes through a slit in the fibres of the lesser muscle of the diaphragm. The Greater and Lesser Splanchnic Nerves enter the abdomen through a distinct opening between the fibres of the lesser muscle of the diaphragm. The Ureter arising from the lower and inner part of the kidney, descends obliquely inwards along the back part of the abdomen to the sacro-iliac sym- physis. Then crossing over the common iliac artery and vein, it is continued into the cavity of the pelvis. Of the Lumbar Absorbent Glands. These are very numerous. Some of them are placed at the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and others in front closely around the aorta and vena cava. They form altogether one connected chain of glands, extending from the pelvis upwards to the diaphriigm. By dissecting through the psoas fnagnus muscle near its origin from the spine,the Lumbar Plexus of

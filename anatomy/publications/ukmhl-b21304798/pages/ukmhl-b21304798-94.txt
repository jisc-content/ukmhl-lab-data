58 veins, just where they unite to form the vena cava; and on the left side, the common iliac artery is placed immediately in front of the corresponding vein. At the point where the aorta divides into the common iliac arteries, a small branch arises, which is denominated the Sacra Media. It descends along the middle of the sacrum to the os coccygis, distributing its ramifications to the surrounding parts, and communicating with the arteriae sacras laterales, which are branches of the internal iliac. The External Iliac artery descends from its origin obliquely outwards, along the inner edge of the psoas magnus to Poupart’s ligament, beneath which it passes into the thigh, and immediately ac- quires the name of femoral. The external iliac ar- tery has the corresponding vein close to its inner side, and rather behind it. Numerous absorbent glands, with plexuses of absorbent vessels, arc placed closely around the external iliac artery in its whole course. These glands are connected below with the deep seated glands in the thigh, and above, witli the lumbar absorbent glands. The branches which the external iliac artery gives off, are— 1. Small twigs to the psoas magnus, to the ab- sorbent glands, and other parts adjacent. 2. The Epigastric Artery, which usually arises from the inner side of the external iliac, just before its passage beneath Poupart’s ligament. From its origin, it sometimes descends a little, and then /

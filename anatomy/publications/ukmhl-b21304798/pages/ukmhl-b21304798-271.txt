235 A small portion separated from the rest of the pa- rotid, denominated Socia Parotidis, is generally connected with the parotid duct near its commence- ment. This part is, however, not constant, either in its size or situation, dnd in some subjects, it is alto- gether wanting. The masseter and temporal muscles are in the next place to be dissected. The Masseter is a thick muscle covering the ramus of the jaw, and is formed by an intermixture of muscular and tendinous fibres. It arises partly tendinous, and partly fleshy, from the under part of the superior maxillary bone, close to its union with the os malae, and from the lower edge and internal surface of the zygoma. Its fibres proceed in different directions to the lower jaw, hence a division is made of the muscle into an anterior and a posterior portion. The anterior portion descends obliquely backwards, the posterior portion obliquely forwards, and both portions uniting, they are inserted into the outer side of the angle and ramus of the jaw as high up as the root of the coronoid process. The Temporal muscle is covered by a thick and strong aponeurosis, which is fixed above to the whole extent of the temporal ridge formed in the sides of the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones, and below to the upper edge of the zygoma, and to the outer edge of the os malae, where it forms the side of the orbit. In removing the aponeurosis, its inner surface will be found closely united to the mus-

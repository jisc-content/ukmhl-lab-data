201 1. Filaments of communication with the cervical ganglia of the Sympathetic. 2. Two Thoracic Nerves, which descend on the outside of the chest, and are distributed to the pectoral and serratus magnus muscles. 3. SuPRA-ScAPUEAR Nerve, which arising from the upper part of the plexus, proceeds obliquely backwards to the supra-scapular notch through which it passes, and then terminates in filaments distributed to the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor muscles. 4. Two or three Infra-Scapular Nerves, which are distributed to the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles. In the dissection of the axilla, filaments of the in- tercostal nerves are seen penetrating the intercostal muscles to the outside of the chest, where they com- municate with the branches of the axillary nerves. The axillary plexus having given off the branches above described, terminates in six nerves for the supply of the arm. These are the Circumflex, the External and Internal Cutaneous, the Me- dian, the Muscular Spiral or Radial, and the Ulnar nerves.

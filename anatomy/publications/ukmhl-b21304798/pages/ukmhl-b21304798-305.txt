269 N 3 bones. The orifice of each sinus is placed underneath the os spongiosum superius, and at about mid- distance between its extremities. The Ethmoid Cells communicate with the nose by several distinct openings, which are found in the superior and middle meatus of each nostril. The termination of the Nasal Duct is found in the inferior meatus, underneath the inferior spongy bone, and at about one-third from its front extremity. The nose is lined throughout by the pituitary mem- brane, which is thick, of a soft spongy texture, and plentifully supplied by vessels. It appears to be composed of a layer of mucous membrane, and of a fibrous stratum beneath, which is in close contact with the bones. The pituitary membrane is extended into the sinuses connected with the nose, but it here loses its spongy texture, and becomes thin and smooth on its surface. At the back part of the nose, the pituitary membrane is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and in front, it is con- tinuous with the common integuments. OF THE MOUTH AND PHARYNX. The cavity of the mouth is bounded above, by the arch of the palate, formed by the superior maxillary and palate bones, behind, by the velum palati, in front, and at the sides, by the lips and cheeks, and below, by the tongue. At its lower and back part,

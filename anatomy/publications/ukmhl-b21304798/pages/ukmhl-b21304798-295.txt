259 times it is so small that it can only be discovered by very careful dissection. The ganglion is connected at its back part with the two filaments already men- tioned, one derived from the third pair, and the other from the first division of the fifth pair. From the front part of the ganglion arise the Ciliary Nerves, which vary in number from six to twelve. These proceed forwards in the orbit, some of them above and others below the optic nerve to the back part of the sclerotica which they penetrate, and then continue their course forwards between the sclerotic I and choroid coats to the iris in which they are ex- clusively distributed. The nerve of the sixth pair, the Abductor, passes through the fissura lacera into the orbit, and proceeding to the outer side of the cavity, terminates in filaments which are distributed to the rectus ex- ternus muscle.

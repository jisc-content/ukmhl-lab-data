587 surface is united in the same manner to the Thalami Optici. The Choroid Plexuses are two soft and vascular substances, formed by duplicatures of the pia mater. Each plexus is seen in the lateral ventricle, begin- ning at the foramen of Monro, through which it is continued into the velum. From the foramina of Monro, the plexuses proceed obliquely backwards upon the thalami optici, external to the margins of the fornix, and are continued through the inferior horns of the ventricles to their termination. Small reddish or grey bodies, which sometimes have a vesicular appearance, are frequently found within the choroid plexuses. The veins of the Choroid Plexuses and Velum unite into two trunks, named the Ven^ Galeni, which proceed together along the middle of the ve- lum to its back part, and here join into a single vessel, which opens into the Fourth Sinus, or Tor- cular Herophili. We have seen that the Pia Mater is continued into the ventricles, and forms the velum and choroid plexuses. It may be further mentioned, that some anatomists have described the continuation of the Arachnoid membrane from the exterior of the brain into its cavities, to form the smooth lining, not only of the lateral ventricles, but also of the third and fourth ventricles. Beneath the posterior part of the velum is the Pineal Gland, which is a reddish grey body, s 2

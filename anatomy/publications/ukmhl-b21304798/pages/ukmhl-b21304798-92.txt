50 its course differently in the male and in the female. In the male it proceeds forwards from the inside of the psoas, and joining the vas deferens, is continued through the inguinal canal with the other parts com- posing the spermatic cord, .and descends from the ring in the tendon of the external oblique muscle to the testicle. The spermatic artery gives off many branches to the cremaster muscle, and other parts of the cord ; and as it approaches the testicle, divides into several branches, which partly distribute them- selves upon the epididymis, and partly penetrate the tunica albuginea, to reach the substance of the tes- ticle. In the female, the spermatic artery descends from the inside of the psoas into the cavity of the pelvis, where it is placed between the layers of the broad ligament of the uterus, and is distributed prin- cipally to the ovary; some of its ramifications ex- tending to the fallopian tubes and to the uterus, where they communicate with the uterine arteries. One or both of the spermatic arteries sometimes arise from the renal arteries. 7. AdiposjE, which are small branches distri- buted to the fat enclosing the kidney. Adipose ai teries are also derived from other sources, as from the capsular, renal, and spermatic arteries. 8. UnETERic.c, which arc small branches dis- tributed upon the ureter. Branches are also sup- plied to the ureter, from the renal, capsular, and spermatic arteries. 9. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery, which

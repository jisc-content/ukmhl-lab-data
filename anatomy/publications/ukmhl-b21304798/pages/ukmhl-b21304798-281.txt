M 3 ^45 milunar fold, variously distinct in different indivi- duals, which has been considered to resemble tlie third eye-lid found in birds, and in some quadru- peds, and is denominated the Membrana Nic* TiTA^rs. Of the Eve-Lids. The eye-lids are not of equal siae, the upper is the larger and more moveable; hence when the lids are brought together, the upper descends below the transverse diameter of the eye, and covers the larger share of the organ, while the lower ascends in a very small degree to meet it. The opening between the lids is not uniformly of the same extent; and it is to this circumstance that the appa- rent difference in the sijie of the eye in different per- sons is referable rather than to any actual difference in the globe itself. The two eye-lids form angles at their union, which are denominated Canthi. The insides, or posterior surface of the lids, is concave, and adapted to the globe with which it is in contact. The edges of the eye-lids present in front an angular margin, along which the Cilia, or eye-lashes, are arranged, and behind these, the edges are sloped off obliquely ; so that when the lids are closed, a triangular canal is here left between them and the opposite sur- face of the eye. This canal is narrow towards the temple, and becomes gradually wider towards the nose. It is considered to serve the purpose of con- veying the tears from the outer towards the inner cor- ner of the eye. Each eye-lid is composed of the following parts

283 mass of muscle occupying the space between the spinous and transverse processes from the second ver- tebra of the neck to the middle of the back. This is The Semi-Spinahs Colli, which arises from the transverse processes of the six or seven upper dorsal vertebras, and ascending obliquely, is inserted into the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrte between the first and the seventh. Lower down in the back, is another mass of muscle lying close upon the spine. This is The Semi-Spinalis Dorsi, which arises from the transverse processes of the seventh, eighth, and ninth dorsal vertebrae, and ascending, is inserted into the spinous processes of the four or five upper dorsal, and of the two lower cervical vertebrae. Lower still than the preceding, is a smaller mass of muscle lying upon the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. This is The Spinalis Dorsi, which arises from the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar, and of the two lower dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the upper dorsal vertebrm, from the first to the seventh or eighth. On the outside of the spinalis dorsi, is a large mass of muscle extending from the sacrum upwards, upon the transverse processes of the lumbar and dorsal" ver- tebrae ; and occupying the hollow between the spinous processes and angles of the ribs. At its lower part, this mass forms only one muscle, but it divides, about opposite to the last rib, into two muscles, named

6 of a semi-circular figure, more towards the side of the abdomen, and extending along the outer edgd of the rectus muscle. This line will be hereafter shewn to be formed by the union of the aponeurosis of the external oblique with the aponeuroses of other muscles beneath. The LiNEa; Transverse; consist of three or four white lines, sometimes but indistinctly seen, which extend across from the linea semilunaris to the linea alba, and are formed by tendinous intersections in the rectus muscle. The external oblique is now to be detached from the ribs and from the crista ilii, and its apo- neurosis carefully divided just above the line of the ,crural arch from the spine of the ilium downwards to within half an inch of the abdominal ring which is thus left entire. The muscle is then to be separated from the internal oblique immediately beneath it, and reflected forwards to a little distance beyond the linea semilunaris, where its aponeurosis is so firmly at- tached to the aponeuroses beneath as to prevent its further reflection. The Obliquus Internus Ascendens, by. the foregoing dissection thus brought into view, is a broad and thin muscle like the external oblique, but difiers from it in being more fleshy at its lower, than at its upper part, and in its fibres having an opposite direction. At the back part of the abdomen, the internal oblique has a considerable breadth of connexion with the aponeurosis of the la- V

253 arises by a tendon from the lower border of the foramen opticum, and proceeding forwards beneath the optic nerve, is inserted into the lower and front part of the sclerotica. The Rectus Externus, or Abductor Oculi, arises partly from the tendon of the preceding mus- cle, and partly from the surface of bone between the foramen opticum and foramen lacerum; and pro- ceeding forwards on the outside of the optic nerve, is inserted into the outer and front part of the scle- rotica. The Rectus Internes, or Adductor Oculi, arises partly from the same tendon as the preceding muscle, and partly from the inner border of the fora- men opticum, and proceeding forwards to the inner side of the eye, is inserted into the inner and front part of the sclerotica. The four Recti muscles become surrounded by cellular sheaths as they approach the globe, and they terminate in flat tendons, which are inserted into the front of the sclerotica opposite to each other, and at about equal distances from the cornea. Each ten- don, at its insertion, is so firmly united to the scle- rotica, that their separation cannot be effected without injury. The Obliques Superior, or Trochlearis, arises from the upper and internal side of the orbit, at a short distance from the foramen opticum, and proceeding forwards along the inner side of the cavity to the internal angular process, here ends in a

388 about the size of a horse bean, and generally of a conical figure, with its basis turned forwards, and its apex backwards. It is united in front, to the thalami optici by two cords of white substance, named its Pedunculi. a few small particles of hard semi- transparent matter pre generally found within the pineal gland. Upon analysis, these particles have been found to be phosphate of lime. In front of the pineal gland, is the Middle or Third Ventricle, which is a vertical fissure bounded on each side, by the thalamus opticus; above, by the velum ; and below, by certain parts at the basis of the brain hereafter to be described. The inner flat surfaces of the thaJami optici, form- ing the sides of the middle ventricle, are in contact with each other, so that there is merely the appearance of a fissure between them. At each extremity, however, this fissure enlarges into a triangular space. The space at the anterior extremity of the fissure is the Foramen Commune Anterius. Its bounda- ries are formed on each side, by the thalami; and, in front, by the anterior crura of the fornix. The space at the posterior extremity of the fissure is the Fora- men Commune Posterius. Its lateral boundaries are the thalami, and its posterior boundary is the basis of the pineal gland. The foramen commune anterius communicates below, with the cavity of the third ventricle; and above, with the foramina of Monro ; hence it is the intermediate passage between the lateral ventricles and the third. The foramen

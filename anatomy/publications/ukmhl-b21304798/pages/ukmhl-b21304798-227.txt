191 VESSELS AND NERVES PASSING FROM THE NECK INTO THE AXILLA. The Subclavian Artery, which arises on the right side, with the carotid, from the arteria innominata, and on the left^ as a distinct branch from the arch of the aorta as before described. Having passed out of the chest, it proceeds first transversely outwards, and then obliquely down- wards, over the flattened surface of the first rib, with which it is in immediate contact. Just in this situa- tion the artery occupies the space between the origins of the scalenus anticus and medius muscles. The axillary plexus of nerves is placed immediately above, and a little behind the artery, and the subclavian vein, in front of it, the scalenus anticus intervening. Having passed beneath the clavicle, the subclavian artery acquires the name of Axillary. Before we describe the branches of the subclavian artery, it will be necessary to remark, that they are more irregular in their distribution than any other series of arteries of equal size in the body ; hence no given description will correspond to the arrangement of them in any two subjects. The branches of the subclavian artery are, the Internal Mammary, the Inferior Thyroid, the Superior Intercostal, the Vertebral, the Cervicalis Profunda, and the Cervicalis Su- PERFICIALIS. 1. The Internal Mammary arises from the

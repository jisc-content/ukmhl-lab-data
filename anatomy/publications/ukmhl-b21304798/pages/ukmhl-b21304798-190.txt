154 Massa Carnea Sylvii, or Flexor Digi- TORUM Accessorius. 'I'his muscle has a very broad oiigin from the inside and under part of the os calcis, behind the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, whence it proceeds obliquely forwards to be attached to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum on its outc r edge. '1 he tendon of the flexor longus digitorum is now seen passing forwards from the inside of the os calcis to the middle of the foot, where it divides into four smaller tendons. These tendons proceed forw’ards and are received into the fibrous sheaths. Then perforating the slits in the tendons of the flexor brevis, they are at length attached to the last phalanx of the four lesser toes. 'I'he tendon of the flexor longus pollicis is also seen passing forw ards from the inside of the os calcis, along the sole of the foot, where it crosses beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum^, and is connected with it by a slip of tendon passing obliquely between them. The tendon of the flexor longus pol- ILcis then proceeds to the inside of the foot, and pass- ing foi wards between the two portions of the flexor brevis poliicis, and between the two se- samoid bones, is attached to the last phalanx of the great toe. • The sole of the foot is here supposed to be placed up- permost. In ihe erect posture of the body, the tendon of the flexor pollicis is situated above the tendon of the flexor di- gitorum. /

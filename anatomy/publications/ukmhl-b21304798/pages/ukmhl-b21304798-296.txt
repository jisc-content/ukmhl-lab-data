For the dissection of the muscles of the pharynx and palate, the parts are to be prepared in the fol- lowing manner : The trachea and oesophagus are to be divided just above the sternum. The oesophagus and pharynx are to be separated from the front of the spine by dividing the cellular tissue which unites them to it. The ligaments uniting the atlas to the occiput, and all the other connexions between the cranium and spine are to be separated, so tliat after the removal of the spine, the pharynx may remain attached to the basis of the skull. The bag of the pharynx is then to be dis- tended with horse-hair or tow passed into it from the mouth above, and from the oesophagus below. It will be hereafter stated in the description of the pharynx, that the back part and sides of the bag are covered externally by an uniform stratum of mus- cular fibres. These are so arranged as to allow of

48 went. The lesser muscle arises by two flattened tendons from the fronts and sides of the bodies of the lumbar vertebras, the tendon on the right side from the three superior, and that on the left from the two superior. The fleshy fibres continued from these tendons, form two fasciculi, denominated the crura, which ascend nearly in a vertical <lirection upon the bodies of the vertebrae, and terminate in the back part of the central tendon. Just below the attachment of the two crura to the central tendon, and towards the left side of the body, an oval opening is seen between them, through which the oesophagus and two nerves of the eighth pair pass from the chest into the abdomen. This is the cardiac, or superior, or oesophageal opening of the diaphragm. The lower boundary of this opening is formed by the decussation of two fasciculi of fleshy fibres which connect the crura, and extend obliquely across between them. Below these decussating fibres, the two crura separate, so as to leave between them a considerable interval towards the front of the spine for the passage of the aorta and thoracic duct. This is the inferior or aortic opening of the diaphragm. Tendinous fibres, uniting the two crura, are stretched across in an aiched form over the aorta as it passes through the interval left between them. The deep-seated muscles of the abdomen are the Psoas Magnus, Psoas Parvus, Iliacus Inter- ijus, and Quadratus Lumborum. The Psoas Magnus is the thick fleshy mass I

55 two in number, arise from the sides of the aorta, at a short distance below the superior mesenteric, and proceed transversely across the abdomen to the kidneys. The artery on the right side is rather the longest, in consequence of the greater distance be- tween the aorta and right kidney. The right renal artery is placed altogether behind the corresponding vein in its course to the kidney, while the left renal artery is placed partly in front, and partly behind its vein. The right renal artery passes across the abdo- men behind the vena cava. Each *renal artery divides as it approaches the kidney into three or four branches, which penetrate the organ in various situa- tions in front and behind the notch on its inner side. The renal artery gives off in its course to the kidney. (а) Capsulares, consisting of small twigs to the renal capsules. (б) Adipose, distributed to the fat of the kidney. Frequently there are four renal arteries, two arising from each side of the aorta, and sometimes three, two on one side, and one on the other. 6. The Spermatic Arteries, which are two small branches, arise from the fore part of the aorta, a little below the renal arteries, one of them frequently having its origin rather higher than the other. Each spermatic artery descends obliquely upon the psoas magnus muscle, in company with the spermatic vein; that on the right side being placed in front of the vena cava. The spermatic artery reaching the lower part and inside of the psoas, continues Q 4

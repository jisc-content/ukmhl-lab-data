156 The Interossei Externi, also named Bicr- piTEs, are four in number. They arise by double heads from the opposite sides of the metatarsal bones of all the toes, and are inserted by distinct tendons into the sides of the first phalanx of the four lesser toes, the great toe having no interosseous muscle in- serted into it. With the dissection of the deep-seated parts in the sole of the foot, we see the terminations of the ten- dons of the tibialis posticus and peroneus longus. The tendon of the tibialis posticus passing for- wards from behind the inner ancle is fixed to the os naviculare, to the internal cuneiform bone, and to the ligaments connecting the adjacent bones of the tarsus. The tendon of the peroneus longus, passing behind the outer ancle, proceeds obliquely over the outside of the os calcis, then through a groove in the os cuboides, and obliquely across the foot, to become attached to the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone be- longing to the great toe. /

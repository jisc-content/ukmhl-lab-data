222 stated that the inferior cervical ganglion of the Sympa- thetic would be more advantageously seen when we came to the chest. The ganglion is placed deeply in the hollow between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the -neck of the first rib. Its size and form vary much. Generally it is joined by a single filament to the first thoracic ganglion, but sometimes the two ganglia are united by a continuity of substance without any connecting filament. The thoracic ganglia are joined by a single filament passing between them, and the lowermost of them is joined by a filament to the first of the lum- bar or abdominal ganglia. The other branches of the thoracic ganglia are, 1. Filaments, from one to four from each gang- lion, which proceed obliquely upwards and outwards, and communicate with the respective intercostal nerves. 2. Small filaments distributed upon the coats of the aorta. 3. The Great Splanchnic Nerve, which arises by four or five filaments, between the sixth and the tenth ganglia. The filaments proceed from the ganglia obliquely forwards upon the spine, and unite into a single nerve about the eleventh dorsal vertebra, which continues its course forwards, and enters the abdomen, by penetrating between the fibres of the lesser muscle of the diaphragm. 4. The Lesser, or Accessory Splanchnic Nerve, which arises by two filaments, from the

261 their division into three distinct muscles, the Con- strictor Inferior covering the lower part of the bag ; the Constrictor Medics, covering the mid- dle; and, the Constrictor Superior, covering the upper part. The fibres of the three constrictors overlap each other successively from below upwards, and the muscles of each side meet in the middle where there is a white tendinous line formed at their junction. The Constrictor Inferior arises from the ex- ternal side of the cricoid cartilage, from the inferior cornu and back part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Its fibres proceed backwards, and expand over the lower part of the pharynx to its middle where they meet the fibres of the opposite muscle. The upper fibres of the constrictor inferior ascend obliquely to their insertion, and cover a considerable extent of the constrictor mcdius, while its lower fibres run more transversely, and the lowermost are connected with the muscular coat of the oesophagus. The Constrictor Medius arises from the cornu of the os hyoides, and from the ligament by which this is united to the thyroid cartilage, and is ex- panded over the pharynx to its middle. The upper- most of its fibres ascend obliquely over the con- strictor superior to the upper part of the pharynx, and are fixed above in a pointed form to the basilar process of the occiput in front of the foramen magnum. Its middle fibres run transversely, and its lowermost fibres descending obliquely beneath the constrictor

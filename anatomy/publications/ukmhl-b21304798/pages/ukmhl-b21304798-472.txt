436 vial membrane, and secured by ligaments passing over them. Distinct articulations are formed be- tween the bases of the arytaenoid cartilages and the upper border of the cricoid. The Arytenoid carti- lages are further connected with the Thyroid by the ligaments of the glottis, which will be presently de- scribed. The Epiglottis is fixed to the larynx by a band of fibrous substance, which proceeds from its inferior pointed extremity, to the angle on the in- side of the thyroid cartilage, at the junction of the alae. OF THE MUSCLES SITUATED UPON THE CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX. The Crico-Thyroideus is described in the dis- section of the neck. At the back part of the larynx, and covered by the mucous membrane of the pha- rynx, is The Crico-Aryt/exoideus Posticus, which arises from the posterior surface of the cricoid car- tilage, and proceeding obliquely upwards and out- wards, is inserted into the external and posterior part of the basis of the arytaenoid cartilage. By separating the ala of the thyroid cartilage from the side of the cricoid, we bring into view, The Crico-ArytÂ«noideus Lateralis, which arises from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage,

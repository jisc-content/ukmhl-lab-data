It is connected with the testicle by vessels, and by the tunica vaginalis, which, as already mentioned, is reflected over it. The up- per end of the epididymis, which is its largest part, is denominated the Globus Major, or Caput Epidi- dymis, and its lower end forms a slight swelling, de- nominated the Globus Minor. The narrow part of the epididymis, between its extremities, is denominated its body.

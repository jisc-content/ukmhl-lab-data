342 of the atlas, just below its superior articular surface. This ligament and the front of the atlas, form together a sort of ring in which the turning motions of the odontoid process take place. The odontoid process presents in front, a con- vex articular surface adapted to the concave surface in the front part of the atlas, and behind, a simi- lar conve.x surface, where it moves in contact with the transverse lia;ament. These articular surfaces are covered by cartilage and by synovial mem- branes. The inferior articular surfaces of the atlas arc con- nected with the corresponding surfaces of the dentata by synovial membranes, and by ligamentous bands, which extend over the front and back part of each articulation. The synovial membranes arc very loose, so as to allow a considerable extent of motion between the two vertebrae. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAE IN GENERAL. The bodies of the vertebrm arc united by an Ante- rior and a Posterior ligament, and by the Interver- tebral Substances. The Anterior Vertebral Ligament consists of a strong band of fibres extended down the front of the spine from the atlas to the sacrum, adhering to the bones and to the intervertebral substances. Be-

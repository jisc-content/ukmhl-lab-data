184 t* tissue, and surrounded by vessels and absorbent glands, which must be carefully removed betore the plexus can be fairly exposed. From the plexus there proceed many branches. Some communicate with the cervical ganglia of the Sympathetic, with the nervus accessorius and hypo-glossal nerve. Others descend, and soon divide into smaller filaments. These proceed downwards, partly in front of the clavicle, and partly behind it. In the former situa- tion they are distributed to the integuments and muscles covering the shoulder and chest, and in the latter, to the parts in the axilla. Two other filaments ascend from the plexus, and have been already described, as being distributed to the integuments of the head, parotid gland, and ex- ternal ear. And, lastly, other filaments pass across the external surface of the mastoid muscle, and are distributed to the platisma myoides, and integu- ments. The PuuENic Nerve is also seen in this stag* of the dissection. It is formed by filaments from the fourth and fifth cervical ner\es, and sometimes also from the third, which unite into a single nerve upon the anterior scalenus muscle. The phrenic nerve de- scends, connected by cellular tissue to the front of this muscle, and thence passes between the subclavian vein and artery into the chest. It distri- butes a few branches to the scalenus aitticus muscle, and has communications with the interior cervical ganglion of the Sympathetic.

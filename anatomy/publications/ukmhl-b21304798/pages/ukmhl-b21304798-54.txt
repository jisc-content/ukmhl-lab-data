18 extent of the boundary within which the viscera are inclosed. The whole extent of the abdomen is arbitrarily divided into certain parts or regions in the following manner: Two imaginary lines are extended across the ab- domen, one from the cartilage of the seventh rib on one side, to the same point on the opposite; the se- cond from the anterior superior spine of the ilium on one side, to the same projection on the other. That part of the abdomen above the upper line is the Epigastric Region. That part below the lower line is the Hypogastric Region. The middle space between the two lines is the Umbilical Region. Two vertical lines are next extended between the cartilage of the seventh rib, and the anterior superior spine of the ilium on each side. By these lines, the three first regions of the abdomen are further divided in the following manner: The right and left parts of the epigastric region, extending beneath the cartilages of the ribs, are theHvpocHONDRiAC Regions, while its central part either retains the name of epigastric, or is denominated the Scrobiculus Cordis. The right and left parts of the umbilical region are the Lumbar Regions, while the central part, in which the umbili- cus is placed, retains the name of umbilical. The right and left parts of the hypogastric regions are each divided into the Iliac and Inguinal Regions, and the front part is designated the Region of the Pubes.

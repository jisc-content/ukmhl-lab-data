252 discovered in the upper part, and extending from the front to the back of the cavity. It is named. The Levator Palpebrje Superioris'. It arises at the back part of the orbit, from the upper margin of the foramen opticum, and proceeds directly tor- wards, becoming broader as it approaches to the front of the orbit. It ends in an aponeurotic ex- pansion, which turns downwards, and is attached to the cartilage of the upper eye-lid, nearly along the whole length of its superior border. Of the muscles of the eye there are four, which are distinguished either according to their direction, and are called the Recti ; or according to their ac- tion, and are called the Levator, Depressor, Abductor, and Adductor. One of these muscles is situated above, and one below the eye, and one on each side. The two other muscles are named the Obliqui. One of them is placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit, and the other at the lower and outer side ; hence they are distinguished by the terms Superior and Inferior. The Rectus Superior, or Levator Oculi, arises by tendinous fibres from the upper border of the foramen opticum, immediately underneath the levator palpebrae superioris, and proceeds directly forwards above the optic nerve to the upper part of the eye, where it ends in an aponeurosis, which turns over the globe, and is fixed to the front of the sclerotica. The Rectus Inferior, or Depressor Oculi,

157 CHAP. VII. DISSECTION OF THE NECK. An incision is to be made cautiously through the integuments down the side of the neck, from the basis of the lower jaw to about the middle of the cla- vicle. Immediately beneath, muscular fibres will be seen running in an oblique direction. The skin is then to be carefully dissected from these fibres, turning one part towards the front, and the other to- Avards the back of the neck, until the whole of the subjacent muscular expansion is exposed, and it is this expansion which we denominate The Platisma Myoides. It arises in the cel- lular tissue that covers the upper part of the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles. At its origin the fibres arc separated from each other, but gra- dually approaching they at length unite and form a broad muscle, which is continued obliquely over the front and side of the neck to the lower jaw, to the basis of which it is attached. Some of the fibres of the muscle are continued so much higher that they become mixed with the muscles of the face, but

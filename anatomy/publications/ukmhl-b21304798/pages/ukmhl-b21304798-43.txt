7 B 4 \ tissimus dorsi muscle *. Moreover it arises from the whole length of the crista ilii along the middle surface of the bone between its external and internal margins, and lastly, by fleshy fibres, from about the outer half of Poupart’s ligament. From these origins, the fibres of the internal oblique proceed in different directions. The superior fibres run obliquely up- wards to the ribs, the middle fibres proceed almost transversely across the abdomen, and the lower fibres descend obliquely towards the os pubis. The fibres have a fleshy insertion above, into the three lower ribs, and by a thin aponeurotic expansion into the cartilages of the four next ribs in succession. In front they end in an aponeurosis which proceeds beneath the apo- neurosis of the external oblique to the outer edge of the rectus muscle. Here the aponeurosis of the in- ternal oblique splits into an anterior and posterior layer. The anterior layer passes in front of the rectus beneath the aponeurosis of the external oblique and is united with it to the linea alba in its whole length. The posterior layer splits into a superior and inferior portion. The superior passes behind the upper three-fourths of the rectus, that is, from the ♦ The aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi, which will be teen in the dissection of the muscles of the back, being con- nected with the internal oblique, and with another muscle, the serratus posticus inferior, is sometimes described as a tendon common to the three muscles by the name of fascia lumborum.

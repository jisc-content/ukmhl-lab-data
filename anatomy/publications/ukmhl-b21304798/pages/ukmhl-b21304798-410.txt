374 and is secured by superior and inferior ligamentous bands passing across from one bone to the other. The articulation between the os naviculare and three cuneiform bones is secured by superior and in- ferior ligamentous bands passing irregularly from one bone to the other. The synovial membrane covers the opposite surfaces of the os naviculare and cunei- form bones, and is reflected into the articulations of the cuneiform bones severally with each other. The articulations between the cuneiform bones are secured by superior and inferior ligamentous bands passing transversely from one bone to the other, and by short ligamentous fibres passing between the opposite sides of the contiguous bones. They are co- vered by the reflection s of one synovial membrane, as already stated. The Metatarsal bones are united to those of the Tarsus, by numerous Dorsal and Plantar ligaments, which are very irregular in their direction. A distinct synovial membrane be longs to the arti- culations of the first and third metatarsal bones with the tarsus. The articulation of the second metatarsal bone is covered by a reflection of the synovial mem- brane from between the two first cuneiform bones. The articulation between the fourth and fifth meta- tarsal bones and the os cuboides is provided with a distinct synovial membrane. Distinct articulations arc formed between the oppo- site sides of the metatarsal bones at their tarsal extre- mities with the exception of the first and second. These

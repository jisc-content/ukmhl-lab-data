214 diaphragm. Here each nerve divides into several branches, of which the greater number are distri- buted to the diaphragm itself; while the rest pene- trating the muscle through its central tendon, pass into the abdomen, and end in communications with the ganglia and plexuses formed about the coeliac aitery. The last stage in the dissection of the chest consists in the examination of the several vessels and nerves in the posterior part of the mediastinum. For this purpose, the ribs are to be removed on each side to within three or four inches of the spine. Either lung is then to be drawn out of its cavity, and fixed towards the opposite side of the chest, and the pleura which passes from the sides of the veitebrm to the root of the lung is to be divided ; when the several vessels and nerves in the posterior part of the medias- tinum will be brought into view. These vessels and nerves are connected by a loose cellular tissue which requires a cautious dissection in its removal. The Trachea, descending from the middle of the mifck, continues its course strait downwards through the chest, to the second or third dorsal vertebra, where it ends by dividing into the tw'o Bronchi. Each bronchus proceeds obliquely downwards and outwards to the corresponding lung. The bronchi, entering the lungs in the situations already men- tioned, ramify in every direction through their substance, dividing into branches, successively smaller and smaller, while their cartilaginous struc-

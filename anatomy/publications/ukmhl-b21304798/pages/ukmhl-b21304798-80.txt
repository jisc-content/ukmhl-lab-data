44 duodenum at it* lower part, near the union of the second with the third portions of the gut. The ductus choledochus passes obliquely for some way between the muscular and mucous coats of the intestine, before it enters into its cavity. The ductus choledochus and pancreatic duct some- times terminate separately in the' duodenum by dis- tinct openings near to each other. The Kidneys arc placed deeply at the back part of the ab lomcn by the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and behind the peritoneum. The right kidney is generally placed a little lower in the abdomen than the left, in consequence of the liver reaching lower down on the one side, than the spleen on the other. In figure the kidney resembles a bean. It is elongated from above downwards, and convex in the greater part of its circumference ; where it is turned towards the parietes of the abdomen, and on the opposite side, it presents a deep excavation, called the notch of the kidney, which is turned towards the spine. The kidneys do not receive any covering from the peritoneum. They are usually sur- rounded by fat contained within a loose cellular tissue. In some subjects, this fat exists in such large quantity as completely to enclose the kidneys, and to isolate them from the surrounding parts. The Renal Capsules are two small bodies of a yellowish-brown colour, situated at the back part of the abdomen behind the peritoneum, and im- mediately above the upper ends of the kidneys. They

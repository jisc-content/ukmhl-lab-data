414 sheath there is a scries of openings for the passage of the spinal nerves, and at its lower end, it has numerous openings for the passage of the nerves arising from the extremity of the cord. The internal surface of the sheatli is smooth, and moistened by fluid, and it is believed by some anatomists, that this smooth surface is derived from a reflection of the arachnoid membrane. The Arachnoid Membrane covering the spinal cord has the same appearance as the corresponding membrane of the brain. Its external surface is simply in contact with tThe dura mater. Its internal surface is united to the pia mater beneath, only by a few long and slender cellular threads; hence it may be very readily raised from the pia mater by the impulsion of air beneath it. The Pia Mater covering the spinal cord is of a much denser and closer texture, and less vascular than the pia mater of the brain. Its internal surface is closely united with the substance of the cord. The Ligamentum Denticui.atum is a thin and narrow band of membranous substance extended down each side of the si)inal cord, between the pia mater and arachnoid membrane. Its inner margin is straight, and is closely united to the pia mater in the space between the anterior and posterior filaments of the spinal nerves. Its outer margin presents a series of pointed projections which are attached to the dura mater in the intervals between the holes for the .passage of the nerves.

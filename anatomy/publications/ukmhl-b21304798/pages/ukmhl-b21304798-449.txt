In order to examine it, the vertebral canal is to be laid open widely at its back part, by the removal of the spinous processes and rings of the vertebrse along the whole length of the spine. The Spinal Cord is invested by membranes corresponding to those of the brain, which are con- tinued from within the cranium through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.

420 Renal, Spermatic, and Hypogastric Plexuses. From the Lumhar (Tanglia of iLe iSympailieiic, there arise filaments which proceed forwards in front of the aorta, and aie united by the intervention of ganglia wiili the corresponding hlaments from the opposite side. From these ganglia proceed filaments to the coats of the aorta, and to the inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. The Sacral Ganglia of the Sympathetic vary from three to five. I'hey are situated on each side of the anterior surface of the sacrum, and are connected by one or more intervening filaments. The connecting filament between the uppermost sacral and the last lumbar ganglion is sometimes wanting. From the last sacral ganglion on each side, there proceeds a filament which descends upon the coccyx. Here the two filaments are united by the intervention of a ganglion, named the Ganglion Impar; in some instances, however, this ganglion is wanting. The sacral ganglia distribute branches to the rectum and to the hypogastric plexus. Iâ€™he Right Par Vagura enters the abdomen on the side and towards the back part of the QEsophagus. It soon divides into branches which form a plexus around the superior orifice of the stomach. From this plexus proceed numerous filaments, some of which are distributed upon the stomach, and others, communicating with the coeliac plexus, extend to the liver, gallbladder, duodenum, and pancreas.

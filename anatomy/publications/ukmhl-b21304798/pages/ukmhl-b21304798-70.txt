34 part of the aorta. From its origin, it advances for- wards, and rather to tlie right between the layers of the lesser omentum, to the extent of about half an inch, and terminates by dividing into three branches, the Coronaria ventriculi, the Splenic, and the He- patic. The Coronaria Ventriculi is the small- est of the three branches of the cceliac. It first bends upwards towards the left, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, and then turns towards the right, along the small arch to the pyloric extremity of the organ. In this course the coronaria ventriculi gives off, 1. Branches, which ramify upon the great end of the stomach, and communicate with the oesophageal arteries, which are branches of the thoracic portion of the aorta. 2. Branches, which ramify upon both surfaces of the stomach, and have free communications with the other arteries of the organ. Near the pylorus, the coronaria ventriculi ends by inosculating with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The coronaria ventriculi frequently gives off a large branch to the liver, in which case it is of equal si:2e to the splenic artery. The Splenic Artery is usually the largest branch of the cceliac. It proceeds from its origin across the abdomen, in a tortuous course, a'ong the upper loidcr of the pancreas, and beneath tlie sto-

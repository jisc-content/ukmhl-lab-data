135 end. It terminates in a tendon which passes beneath the annular ligament, and then proceeds forwards upon the foot, inclining at the same time inwards to terminate in the first and second phalanges of the great toe by distinct tendinous slips. A small muscle is occasionally placed along the outer side of the extensor longus digitorum. This is The Peroxeus Teutius. It arises from the lower part of the fibula, and proceeds downwards beneath the annular ligament, and over the foot to be at- tached by a distinct tendon to the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone belonging to the little toe. This muscle is sometimes wanting, and when it does exist, it varies so much in its appearance that it will scarcely be found alike in any two subjects. The tendon alone may be present, and when there are distinct fleshy fibres giving rise to the tendon, they are almost constantly united witii the extensor longus digitorum, so completely as to form a part of it. The Pfroneus I .ongus arises from the outer side of the tw'o upper thirds of the fibula, and by a few fibres from the head of the tibia. It proceeds dowir- wards, and is connected in its course with the apo- neurotic expansions, separating it in front and be- hind from the adjacent muscles. It terminates in a tendon wnich proceeds through a groove in the lowt r end of the fibula behind the projection of the bone, lorraing the malleolus extcnuis. The tendon

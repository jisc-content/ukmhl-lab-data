280 At tiie upper part of the neck is seen The Splenius Capitis extended obliquely be- tween the occiput and spine. It arises from the spinous processes of the two upper dorsal vertebra, and from the lower two thirds ot the ligamentum nucha?,, and ascending obliquely outwards is in- serted into the back part of the mastoid process, and into the adjacent curved portion of the superior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. The insertion of the splenius capitis is covered by the insertion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. Be- tween the splenius capitis of each side, a triangular space is left in wliich a part of the complexi mus- cles is seen. Along the front edge of the splenius capitis, is The Splenius Colli, which arises from the spinous processes of the third, fourth, and fifth dorsal vertebra?, and ascending obliquely outwards, is inserted by distinct tendinous and fleshy portions into the transverse processes of the two or throe upper cervical vertebrie. The splenius capitis and colli are united so closely at the lower part of the neck, as here to form but one muscle. 'I’he splenius capitis is to be reflected from the spine, and left attached to the occiput, and the splenius colli is to be reflected from the doi’sal ver- tebrae, and left attached to the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. A long narrow muscle is extended between

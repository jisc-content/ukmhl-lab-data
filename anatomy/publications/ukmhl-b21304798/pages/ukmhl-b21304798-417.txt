381 cellular tissue. The arteries of the pia mater are the nutrient arteries of the brain, which thus ramify and divide very minutely upon its exterior surface before they enter its substance. The veins of the pia mater are derived only from th.e brain. When a portion of the pia mater is gently raised from the brain, the connecting vessels appear as fine delicate threads, elongating as they are drawn out of its substance. The division of the Cerebrum into Hemispheres has been already mentioned. Each hemisphere is divided into an Anterior, a Middle, and a Posterior Lobe, but it is only on the under surface of the brain that these are accurately defined. The Ante- rior and Middle Lobes are separated by a fissure, named the Fissura Sylvii, which e.xtends ob- liquely backwards from the basis to a considerable depth between the convolutions. This fissure is partly filled by the transverse spinous process of the sphenoid bone, which projects a short way within it. The Middle Lobe is distinguished from the Pos- terior Lobe by the limits of a superficial excavation in the under surface of the latter, which is adapted to the upper convc.x surface of the cerebellum. 1 he Anterior Lobes rest upon the orbitar plates of the frontal bone. The Middle Lobes arc lodged in the temporal fossae, formed by the sphenoid and tempo- ral bones. The Posterior Lobes rest upon the tento- rium. Each Hemisphere has its upper surface uniformly ^convex, adapting itself to the concavity of the skull, i

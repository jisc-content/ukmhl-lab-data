150 lying upon the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and partly beneath the abductor. The middle mass of muscles in the foot consists of The Flexor Brevis Uigitorum Pedis, at- tached behind to the os calcis, and sending off four tendons to the toes. Beneath the flexor brevis digitorum, the tendons of the flexon longus digitorum, and flexor longus pol- licis, are seeu proceeding to the toes. Four small muscles, denominated Lumbricales, arc connected with the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum in the front of the foot; and behind, a * mass of muscle is extended obliquely across the foot between these tendons and the os calcis. This is the Massa Carnea Sylvii, or. Flexor Accessorius. VESSELS AND NErVeS IN THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. The Posterior Tibial Artery passing from the inside of the Os Calcis, beneath the abductor pol- licis, here divides into the External and Inter- nal Plantar Arteries. The External Plantar Artery is the larger of the two. It proceeds forwards between the flexor brevis digitorum and massa carnea to the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone belonging to the little toe. It then proceeds across the metatarsal bones near their digital ends to the great toe, thus forming the Plantar

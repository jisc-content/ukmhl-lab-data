172 muscle. About the middle of the neck, it com- municates with the cervical nerves by a branch which extends in the form of an arch across the front of the internal jugular vein. As the hypo- glossal nerve approaches the tongue, it distri- butes many filaments to the surrounding muscles. The trunk of the nerve penetrating the geiiio-glossus, here ends by splitting into a number of branches which arc distributed to the muscular fibres along the middle of the tongue from the basis towards the apex; none of the filaments of this nerve are tj aced into the papillce. There are communicating branches be- tween the hypo-glossal and gustatory ner\es. The LiNGUan or Gustatory Branch of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve passes forwards from the inside of the lower jaw, between the mylo-hyoidcus and hyo-glossus, with the submaxillary duct, and then turns upwards to the side of the tongue. In this course it distributes many filaments to the surrounding parts, especially to the submax- illary gland, and some of these ha\e communications with the hypo-glossal nerve, dâ€™he gustatory nerve, at its termination, splits into ten or twelve filaments which penetrate between the muscular fibres of the tongue, and are distributed to the mucous membrane covering the sides and point of the organ where they are traced in tlie papillaj.

554 ARTICULATION OF THE HUMERUS WITH THE SCAPULA. The Capsule of the shoulder-joint is formed by the union of a fibrous with a synovial membrane. The fibrous membrane, which is external, terminates at the upper part of the joint in an attachment to the circumference of the glenoid cavity, and below, it is attached round the neck of the humerus. The synovial membrane is reflected from the inside of the fibrous membrane upon the cartilaginous surfaces of the glenoid cavity and head of the humerus. 'I'he superior part of the capsule is the thickest, where it is covered by a band of ligamentous fibres, which, at their other extremities, are fixed to the coracoid process. Iâ€™he capsule is further strengthened by the tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles, which are united to it in various situations. The length of the capsule is such, that when it is extended by drawing the humerus and scapula in opposite directions, the space of an inch will intervene between the articular surfaces of the bones. Upon close e.xamination, a process of synovial membrane will be seen extended down the bicipital groove of the humerus, lining it for the extent of an inch, and then reflected upwards round the tendon of the biceps muscle, so as completely to cover it as far as its origin from the upper edge of the glenoid

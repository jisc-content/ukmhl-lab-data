423 heart. The auricles appear as appendages attached to the bases of the ventricles. The Right Auricle is to be first examined. Into the cavity of the right auricle, the blood returns from the general venous system, by the two Venae Cavae, and from the heart itself, by the Coronary Vein. The Right Auricle is situated at the basis of the corresponding ventricle. Its figure is very irregulaiâ€™, and it is rather larger than the left auricle. A narrow portion of the right auricle projects from its upper part and left side. This is named the Appendix Auricul.e. The appendix has irregularly jagged edges, and terminates in a point. The right auricle is now to be laid open in the fol- lowing manner : One incision is to be made trans- versely across its front part into the appendix auriculae. A second incision is to extend from the middle of the first, directly upwards into the vena cava superior, which opens into the auricle at its upper and back part. On the anterior side of the cavit)' of the right auri- cle, and within the appendix auriculae, there are nu- merous fasciculi of muscular fibres, separated by in- tervals of various widths, in which there are smaller fasciculi disposed obliquely. I'he larger fasciculi are generally parallel to each other, hence they are com- pared to the teeth of a comb, and are denominated the Mosculi Pectinati. The inner side of the right auricle is formed by the partition separating it

210 the chest to the point where it is joined with the left subclavian vein, to form the vena cava su- perior. The Left Subclavian Vein proceeds from the scalenus muscle, nearly in an horizontal direction across the chest to its termination. In this course it IS placed just above the arch of the aorta. In front, it is separated from the sternum only by loose cel- lular tissue, and behind, it crosses the trachea and the arteria innominata. The Subclavian Veins receive the following branches. 1. The External and Internal Jugular Veins, already described in the dissection of the neck. 2. The Vertebral Veins, which are two in number, descending from the holes in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. 3. The T-ntteutjal Mammary Veins, which ac- company the internal mammary arteries. 4. The Inferior TiiYRoiiuiAc Veins, described in the dissection of the neck. The Vena Cava Superior is formed by the junction of the two subclavian veins on the right side of the chest, a little above the arch of the aorta, and opposite to the cartilage of the first rib. It descends in a strait course on the right of the aorta from which it is separated by a small space filled by cel- lular tissue. In its descent, it becomes covered by the reflection of the pericardium, and continuing its

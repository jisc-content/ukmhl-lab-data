400 nerves, the Facial or Portio Dura, and the Au- ditory or Portio Mollis. The Facial Nerve arises from the posterior and lateral part of the tuber annulare. The Auditory Nerve is stated to arise, either by the striae of white substance on the anterior side of the fourth ventricle, or from the crus cerebelli immediately behind the origin of the facial nerve. The auditory nerve turns forwards and becomes closely united to the side of the facial. The two nerves then proceed together upwards and outwards to the meatus audi- torius internus. At the bottom of the meatus, they separate for their distinct destinations, one to the in- ternal ear, and the other to the face. The eighth pair of nerves is formed of three dis- tinct nerves, the Glosso-pharyngeal, the Nervus Vagus, and the Nervus Accessorius. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve arises by se- veral filaments from the side of the medulla oblongata, immediately below the tuber annulare, and behind the corpus olivare. The Nervus Vagus arises by many filaments ar- ranged perpendicularly along the side of the medulla oblongata, immediately below the origins of the glosso- pharyngeal. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve and the Nervus Va- gus proceed together outwards an^ forwards to the foramen jugulare, through which they pass out of the skull. The Nervus Accessorius arises by a series of

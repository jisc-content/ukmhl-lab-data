28 arteries, veins, and nerves of the jejunum and ilium; the lacteal vessels and absorbent glands; all of which are connected by cellular tissue, with more or less fat. The large intestine begins, as it has been men- tioned, in the right iliac region, whence it rises di- rectly upwards in front of the kidney, almost to the under surface of the liver, and then turns forwards, continuing its course transversely across the abdomen in front of the great arch of the stomach. Reaching the left side, the intestine turns downwards through the left lumbar region, and is continued through the left iliac fossa to the junction of the last lumbar vertebra with the sacrum, which is the point where the rectum commences. The first portion of the large intestine, placed in the right iliac region, forms a cap icious bag of a rounded figure, denominated the Ccecum or Caput Coli. The ilium opens obliquely into its left side, as before stated, and towards the back part and right side of the ccEcum, a cylindrical process of intestine, about the size of a quill, is ex- tended from it, which is the Appendix Vkr- MIFORMI8 C(ECi. The appendix verraiformis is generally about two inches in length, but it differs much in this respect in different subjects. It termi- nates by a rounded and closed extremity, and is united on one side by a small fold of peritoneum to the opposite part of the ccecum. The bag of the Ccecum gradually contracts at its

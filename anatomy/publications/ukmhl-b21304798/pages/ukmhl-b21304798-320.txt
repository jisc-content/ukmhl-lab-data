284 Sacro-Lumbalis, and Longissimus Dorsi, the latter of which is placed more internally and close to the spinalis dorsi. The Sacro-Lumbalis and Longissimus Dorsi, thus forming but one mass of muscle at their com- mencement, arise by a common tendon externally, and by fleshy fibres internally, from the posterior part of the crista ilii, from the posterior surface of the sacrum, and from the spinous and transverse pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebra?. The Sacro-Lumbalis is inserted by distinct tendons into all the ribs near their angles. The Longissimus Dorsi is inserted into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae, and into the ribs between their tubercles and angles. The tendon of the Transversalis Abdominis muscle is now to be examined in its passage between die Quadratus Lumborum, and the lower part of the Sacro-Lumbalis and Longissimus Dorsi, to be at- tached to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Ihe sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi muscles arc covered at the upper part of the. back by a thin aponeurotic expansion, which is united bv one edge to the angles of the ribs, and by the other to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae. By separating the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi from each other, there are seen Ihe Musculi Accessorii, which consist of six or eight small fleshy slips extended between the inner \

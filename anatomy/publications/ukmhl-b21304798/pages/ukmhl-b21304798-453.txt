417 T 5 the sacral nerves, incline downwards from the spinal cord, and occupy the lower part of the sheath of the dura mater. They are connected by vessels and by fine cellular tissue, and form a thick bundle of nerves, which is named the Cauda Equina. The Cervical Nerves divide at short distances from the ganglia into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branches of the four first cervical nerves are described in the dissection of the neck. The anterior branches of the four last cervical nerves unite with the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve to form the axillary plexus. The posterior branches of all the cervical nerves pass backwards, and are distributed principally to the muscles covering the posterior part of the neck. The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve, penetrating the coraplexus muscle, becomes superficial and takes the name of Occipital nerve. Its distribution is described p. 226. The Dorsal Nerves divide in the same manner into Anterior or Intercostal branches, and Posterior or Dorsal branches. The Intercostal branches proceed outwards between the transverse processes of the ver- tebrae to the angles of the ribs. Here they enter be- tween the two strata of the intercostal muscles, and pass to the grooves in the lower edges of the ribs, along w'hich they are continued with the intercostal artery and vein. The intercostal nerves communicate with the thoracic ganglia of the Sympathetic. Their filaments are partly distributed to the intercostal and triangularis sterni muscles, and partly penetrating

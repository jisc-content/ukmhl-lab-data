13S ihe tarsal ends of the two lirst metatarsal bones, and penetrates between them into the sole of the foot^ where it terminates by joining a large branch of the posterior tibial artery. I he branches of the anterior tibial are, 1. Recurrens, which arising just after the ar- tery appears in the front of the leg, turns upwards, and ramifies over the knee joint, where it communi- cates with the lower ariirular arteries. 2. Muscular Branches, which arise from the artery in its whole course. 3. Malliolaris Interna, which ramifies on the inner ancle. 4. Malleolauis Externa, which ramifies on the outer ancle. 5. Tarsea, which passes across the tarsus, be- neath the extensor brevis digitorum to the outer edge of the foot, thus forming the tarsal arch, from which proceed the interosseous arteries. 6. Metatarsea, which ramifies upon the meta- tarsal bones. '^I his is sonu times wanting. 7. Dorsalis IIali.ucis, which arises from the anterior tibial just before its passage into the sole of the foot, and proceeds forwards between the two first metatarsal bones, here ending in branches distri- buted to the great toe, and to the toe next to it. The Anterior Tibial Veins are two in number, accompanying the artery, one 'on each side. At the upper part of the leg, they join into a single trunk, which penetrates the aperture^ in the

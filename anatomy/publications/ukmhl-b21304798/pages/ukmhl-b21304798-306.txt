270 the mouth communicates with the pharjmx by an opening, which is denominated the Isthmus Faucium. The mouth is lined throughout by a mucous mem- brane, which is continuous in front upon the lips, with the integuments of the face ; and behind, with the mucous lining of the pharynx. The mucous membrane forms in its reflection from the lips to the adjacent parts, two small triangular folds, denomi- nated frsena, which unite the lips more closely to the middle and front of the maxillary bones. Between the under surface and middle of the tongue, and the opposite part of the lower jaw, the mucous mem- brane forms another fold, which is the Frjenum Lixgu;e. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth, numerous small mucous glands are found which are arranged according to their situation, into the Buc- CALES distributed in the cheeks;—Molares also in the cheeks, opposite to the molar teeth ;—Labiaees in the lips tPalatin^: upon the palate, and Lin- GUALEs at the root of the tongue. These glands are of a roundish form, and short ducts proceed from them which open into the cavity of the mouth. The Velum Palati, or Soft Palate, is a fleshy curtain, extended from the posterior edge of the palatine arch downwards into the pharynx. Its anterior surface is inclined downwards and forwards towards the tongue. Its upper border, which is its thickest part, is fixed to the posterior edge of the pa-

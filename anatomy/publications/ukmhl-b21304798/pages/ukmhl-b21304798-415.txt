379 , will be seen to commence in front by a small cul sac close to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone, and to become gradually wider as it proceeds backwards. At its termination, it sometimes opens into one lateral sinus only, and sometimes is con- tinued into both. Slender fibrous threads extend across the cavity of the sinus from one side to the other, and small granular bodies of a whitish colour are observed in its cavity, especially towards its middle, and about the orifices of the veins. These bodies are the Glandulae Pacchioni, which will be again mentioned. The Veins which open into the Superior Longi- â–  tudinal Sinus are derived from the external parts of the head, from the skull, from the dura mater, and from the brain. The veins derived from the brain are the largest in number and size. \ Ten or twelve large trunks from the upper convex surfaces of the hemispheres terminate in each side of the sinus. It will be noticed, that most of these veins run obliquely forwards as they approach the inner margins of the hemispheres. The Inferior Longitudinal Sinus is situated, as already mentioned, in the lower border of the falx cerebri. It terminates behind in a sinus, named the Fourth Sinus, or Torcular Heropjiili which is placed between the posterior broad end of the falx and the tentorium. The Glandulae Pacchioni are found partly within the cavity of the superior longitudinal sinus

123 G 2 the epithets superior and inferior. The ischiatic nerve is seen passing over these three muscles in its course to the back of the thigh. The Obturator Ivternus arises within the pelvis, from the posterior surface of the os pubis, and from the obturator ligament. It proceeds down- wards, and passes out of the pelvis at the lesser sacro- ischiatic notch. On leaving the pelvis, the muscle is received between the gemelli, and ends in a ten- don which passes downwards, closely connected with the tendons of the gemelli on each side, and is in- serted into the cavity at the root of the trochanter major. Mâ€™ithin the pelvis, the obturator internus is covered by an aponeurotic expansion, from which the fibres of the levator ani take their orimn. The O surface of the ischium is covered by a thin layer of cartilage, where the obturator internus turns round the bone, and a bursa mucosa is placed between the tendon and the cartilage beneath it. The Gemelli or Gemini. The Gemellus Su- FERiOR arises from the spinous process of the ischium. The Gemellus Inferior arises from the back part of the tuberosity of the same bone. The two muscles proceed liorizontally outvvards by the sides of the obturator internus, and are inserted with it into the cavity at the root of the trochanter major, below the insertion of the pyriformis. Below the gemellus inferior, a small square muscle extends across from the tuber ischii to the tro- chanter major. This is

I 51 its inner edge, to the line in the ilium denominated linea innominata, or linea ilio-pectinca, which bounds the superior aperture of the pelvis ; and be- low, it is attached to Poupart’s ligament from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, downwards to within a short distance of the insertion of the liga- ment into the pubes. The fascia here terminates in a pointed form over the external iliac vein, just in the situation where it is continued into the femoral vein. A portion of the same fascia is extended down- wards, beneath Poupart’s ligament, between the external iliac vessels and the os pubis into the thigh, where it terminates by becoming continuous with the fascia lata. The extension of this portion of the fascia iliaca behind the femoral vessels, and its continuity with the fascia lata cannot, however, be seen until the thigh is dissected. It will be recollected that the insertion of Pou- part’s ligament into the spine of the os pubis forms a roundish tendinous cord, which is the lower column of the abdominal ring. It is now to be further ob- served, that a thinner portion of tendon is continued inwards from the spine for some way along the crista of the os pubis, and here terminates by a sharp crescent-shaped edge inclined backwards, or towards the cavity of the abdomen. This edge is known by the appellation of the crescent-shaped edge of the crural arch, and the thin portion of tendon which forms it, is usually denominated Gimbernat’s Ligament. It may be distinctly seen from the cavitv of the abdo- D 2

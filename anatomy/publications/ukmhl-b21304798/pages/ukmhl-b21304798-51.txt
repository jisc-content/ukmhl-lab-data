15 the cremaster muscle, which is expanded upon it. Passing through the ring, the cord turns directly downwards over its lower column, to be continued into the scrotum. It has been seen that the spermatic cord, in its course from the abdomen to the ring in the tendon of the obliquus externus, is lodged in an oblique canal. This is denominated the inguinal canal. It has two openings, of which, the upper, formed by the interval in the fascia, is called the internal ring, the lower, formed in the aponeurosis of the external oblique, is called the external ring. The situation of the internal ring is immediately above the crural arch, and about mid-distance between the anterior su- perior spine of the ilium and the angle of the os pubis. The epigastric artery, as it will be hereafter seen, arises from the external iliac near to the crural arch. It passes across and underneath the spermatic cord, just as the cord enters the inguinal canal, and con- tinues its course obliquely upwards and inwards, along the inner margin of the upper opening of the canal, to the posterior surface of the rectus muscle. In the female, the round ligament of the uterus pursues the same course from the abdomen as the spermatic cord in the male, as far as the ring in the tendon of the external oblique. Having passed through the ring, the round ligament terminates by dividing into a number of slender threads, which are lost in the cellular tissue of the mons veneris. In the female, the epigastric artery holds the same 0k

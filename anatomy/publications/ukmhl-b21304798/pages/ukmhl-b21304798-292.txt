256 to tliirty in number, which penetrate the sclerotica near the optic nerve, and are distributed to the back part of the choroid coat. 3. The Anterior Cieiary Arteries, varying from three to twelve, which penetrate the sclerotica, near its union with the cornea, and are distributed to the ciliary processes and iris. The ophthalmic artery at its termination passes from the inner corner of the eye to the nose, and here communicates with branches of the facial and of the infra-orbitary arteries. The Veins of the eye correspond to the arteries. Thus the veins of the choroid coat and iris penetrate different parts of the sclerotica. The Vena Cen- tralis llETiNiE accompanies the corresponding arteiy. These branches unite into the Ophthalmic Vein, which passes out of the orbit through the fissura laccra into the cranium, and terminates in the cavernous sinus. OF THE NERVES OF THE EYE. The Optic Nerve entering the orbit through the foramen opticum, proceeds forwards, and rather ob- liquely outwards to the back part of the globe which it penetrates on the inner or nasal side of its axis. In this course, the nerve is surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath, which it obtains in the following manner. The dura mater is continued from within

207 each lung presents a concavity corresponding to the convexity of the diaphragm. This, however, applies to the condition of the parts in the dead subject, %Vhen the diaphragm is seen only in the state in which it is during expiration. In the living body, when the diaphragm descends in the act of inspira- tion, and becomes almost horizontal, the lungs closely following it, necessarily undergo a corresponding change in their figure. Each lung is divided by very deep fissures into lobes, the right into three lobes, of which the middle is the smallest; and the left into two of nearly equal extent. The lungs, it should be observed, possess no power of motion within themselves. In respiration, therefore, being wholly passive, they can only fol- low the movements of the organs by which they arc surrounded. Each lung, therefore, must accurately fill the side of the chest in which it is lodged, and the external surface of the lung, formed by the pleura pulinonalis, must be in close contact with the lining of the chest, formed by the pleura costalis. The Heart, surrounded by its serous membrane, the pericardium, is lodged between the pleurae in the lower and middle part of the chest, towards the left side. The Pericardium presents itself to our view as a pyramidal bag, with its basis turned upwards and backwards as corresponding to the basis of the heart. It lies behind the sternum, and the cartilages of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and is connected with these parts only by loose cellular tissue. The sides of the pericardium are covered by the pleurae, and

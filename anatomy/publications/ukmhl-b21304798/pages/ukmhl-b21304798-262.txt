S26 I its fibres ascend and terminate in the aponeurosis. ^ Towards the front of the head the fleshy fibres, again arising from the aponeurosis, descend upon the frontal bone, and are inserted partly into the skin of the eyebrow, and are partly intermixed with the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum and corrugator supcrcilii muscles. A small slip of muscular fibres is continued from the front part of the occipito- frontalis downwards upon the upper part of the nose. The aponeurosis connecting the occipito-frontales is united to the periosteum of the skull, by cellular tissue, in which fat is never deposited. The fleshy portions of the occipito-frontalis are penetrated by numerous filaments of nerves. In front, these are derived on each side, from the supra- orbitary branch of the fifth pair of the cerebral nerves, and behind, from the great occipital nerve, which is a branch of the second pair of the cervical nerves. The Occipital Nerve penetrates the corn- plexus muscle close to the occiput, then becoming j subcutaneous, it divides into numerous filaments, which are distributed to the occipito-frontalis muscle, and to the integuments covering the posterior part, sides, and upper part of the head. Towards the front they communicate with the filaments of the su- | pra-orbitary nerve. The other muscles on the outside of the head are i connected with the external ear. They are three in j number. , The Attollejjs Aurem is a thin and triangular

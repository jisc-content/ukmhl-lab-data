240 (g) Pharyngeal Branches distributed to the upper part of the pharynx. (4) Pterygo-Palatine Branches which pass through the pterygo-palatine canal to be distributed upon the palate, tonsils, and uvula. (t) Spheno-Palatine Branch, which passes through the spheno-palatine foramen to the nose. The Internal Maxillary Artery having given otF these bnuiches, now receives the name of Infra- Orbitary, and passing through the infra-orbitary canal with the accompanying nerve, it emerges upon the face from the infra-orbitary foramen, and here divides into several branches which communicate freely with the Transversalis Faciei, Ophthalmic, and Facial arteries, thus forming a net-work of vessels on the side of the face. The External Maxillary Artery was de- scribed in the dissection of the neck to the point where it ascends upon the lower jaw, close to the front edge of the masseter muscle. It then takes the name of Facial, and ascends obliquely forwards in a very tortuous course to the -corner of the mouth, whence it is continued upwards beneath the zygo- matic muscles to the side of the nose. The branches given off by the facial artery, are (а) Branches distributed to the masseter muscles. (б) The Superior and Inferior Coronary Arteries which run along each lip near its edge, and at the middle of the lips, inosculate with the arte- ries of the opposite side.

344 mersed in water, its fibrous laminae acquire a reddish tint, and when a section is made of it, the pulpy tissue in the centre swells out beyond the level of the sur- rounding surface. The articulating processes of the several vertebrae are closely connected by capsules and by ligamentous fibres extended irregularly between them. Between the back parts of the rings of the vertebrae there are ligaments which are of a flattened form, and composed of a very elastic and yellowish substance, hence they are denominated Ligamenta Sub- FLAVA. These ligaments close the intervals between the vertebrae, and thus complete the back part of the spinal canal. They extend from the second vertebra downwards to the sacrum. The best method of ex- amining them is to remove the rings of the vertebrae with the ihtervening ligaments in one piece from the whole length of the spine. The intervals between the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae are filled by ligamentous expansions formed of decussating fibres, which are attached above to the lower edge of one spinous pro- cess, and below, to the upper edge of the next in succession. The points of the dorsal and lumbar spinous pro- cesses are farther connected by a distinct longitudinal ligament extending between them. The fibres of the muscles on each side are intimately united to this ligament. I

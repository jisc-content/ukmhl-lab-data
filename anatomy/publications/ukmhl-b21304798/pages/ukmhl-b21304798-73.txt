37 to the under surface of the liver, which they pene- trate and then ramify through the organ. The hepatica de.xtra gives otf as it approaches the liver. 3. The Cystic Artery, which is a branch of a small size, ramifying between the coats of the gall- bladder and upon the biliary ducts. Some of the ra- mifications of the cystic artery penetrate the gall-blad- der, and terminate in the liver. The hepatica sinistra is sometimes supplied by the coronaria ventriculi, as before mentioned. The hepatica dextra sometimes has its origin from the superior mesenteric artery. The veins of the stomach accompany the arteries in their distribution. They terminate in the vena portae. The splenic vein accompanies the splenic artery in its course along the upper border of the pancreas. It also opens into the vena portae. The Vena Portae is formed by the union of those veins which return the blood from the spleen, pan- creas, gall-bladder, stomach, and intestines. There are two principal trunks in which the veins from these organs terminate; namely, the Splenic and Superior Mesenteric Veins, which, as it will be hereafter seen, are joined behind the pancreas. The vena porta?, thus formed, proceeds from behind the pancreas obliquely upwards, between the layers of the lesser omentum, between and rather behind the ductus choledochus and the hepatic artery, to the liver.

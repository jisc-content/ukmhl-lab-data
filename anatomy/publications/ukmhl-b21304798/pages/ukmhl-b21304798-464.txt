428 MOXD Valves, which have their convex edges fixed and turned downwards towards the ventricle, and their concave edges loose, and turned upwards towards the artery. The loose edge of each valve is its thickest part, and at about its middle, there is a small tubercle, sometimes not very distinct, which is named the Corpus Sesamoideum, or Corpus Arantii. The office of the semilunar valves is to prevent any reflux of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. When the ventricle contracts, the three valves are pressed by the blood against the sides of the artery. When, on the other hand, the three valves are raised, by the pressure of blood from the artery towards the ventricle, they meet in the centre of the artery, so as to form a complete partition across its cavity. The Pulmonary Artery proceeds from its origin obliquely upwards, and to the left closely around the commencement of the aorta, to which it is connected by cellular tissue. When it reaches the left side of the aorta it divides into a right and left branch which separate from each other, and proceed transversely to the corresponding lung. The right branch crosses beneath the aorta at a short distance above its origin from the heart. Just at the point where the pulmo- nary artery divides into its right and left branches, a thick fibrous and impervious cord proceeds from it, and is attached at its other extremity to the concave side of the arch of the aorta. This cord is the re- mains of the Ductus Arteriosus, which, in the foetus,

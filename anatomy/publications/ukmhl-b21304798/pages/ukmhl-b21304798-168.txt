132 ,trating the fascia, and thence continuing its course downwards, it distributes its hlanients upon the upper surface of the foot, where they communicate with- the filaments of the iiervus saphenus. The Fascia is much thicker where it covers the muscles in the front of the leg than in other situa- tions. It is continuous above with the fascia lataj and is besides attached to the head of the fibula, and is firmly connected with the tendinous insertions of the sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis. In its course downwards, the fascia is extended over the muscles in front and behind the leg, and is fixed to the outer and inner edges of the tibia, where it ter- minates without being continued over the front of the bone, so that the latter is in immediate contact with the skin. Below, the fascia appears lost in the cel- lular tissue about the heel, and in front, it is con- tinuous with a broad band of tendinous fibres ex- tended across the front of the ancle joint, and de- nominated the Annular, or Transverse Liga- ment. The annular ligament is attached on the outer side of the foot, to the upper part of the os calcis, and is thence continued across the front of the ancle joint, binding down the tendons of the ex- tensor muscles, and on the inner side, is attached to the malleolus internus and os naviculare. A broad band of tendinous fibres, which may be denominated the Internal Annular Ligament, extends from the malleolus internus to the posterior part and inner side of the os calcis. The tendons of -

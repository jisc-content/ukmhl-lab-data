179 artery will be given with the dissection of the brain. The Internal Jugular Vein begins above at the foramen jugulare, which is the termination of the lateral sinus of the brain, and descends on the inside of the internal carotid artery, and behind the styloid process to the side of the neck. It is then continued strait downwards on the outside of the common caro- tid artery and par vagum, and is included with them in the same cellular sheath. At the lower part of the neck the internal jugular vein opens into the subclavian vein, just where it passes into the chest, and on the inside of the termination of the external jugular. , The internal jugular vein receives, in its course along the neck, branches corresponding to the rami- fications of the external carotid artery, of which it will be sufficient to mention the names. They are the Superior Thyroideal, External Maxil- lary, Lingual, Pharyngeal, and Occipital Veins. The Par Vagum forms one of the divisions of the eighth pair of the cerebral nerves. Leaving the skull at the foramen jugulare, the par vagum is first found in front ot the hypo-glossal nerve, and then passing behind it, is continued strait down the neck betw'cen, and rattier behind, the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, as it has been already menuoued. In entering the clnsL, the par vagum passes imme- diately in front of the subclavian artery on the right 1 6

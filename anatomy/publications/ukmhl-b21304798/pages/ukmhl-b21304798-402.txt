360 tinguishcd into the Long and Short. The first is a round cord, attached above to the external condyle, and below to the outside of the head of the fibula. The short external lateral ligament is placed behind the former. It is fi.xed above, to the lowest point of the external condyle, and below, to the extremity of the head of the fibula. This ligament is not always distinctly seen. The Ligamentum Posticum Winslowii is a broad e.xpansion, extended obliquely across the back part of the joint between the external condyle and the head of the tibia, where it is connected with the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle. Other smaller bands of fibres are here extended irregularly upon the capsule. The Ligamentum Patellae is to be regarded as the termination of the tendons of the extensor mus- cles. It is a very thick band of fibres, about two inches in length and one inch in breadth, attaclied above to the inferior angle of the patella, and to the depression in its posterior surface, and below, to the anterior tuberosity of the tibia. A bursa mucosa is placed between the ligament and the front of the tibia, just above the tuberosity. Above the bursa, a large quantity of fat occupies the space between the posterior surface of the ligament and tht; synovial membrane of the joint. In order to examine the extent and connexions of the synovial membrane, the surrounding parts must be very carefully reflected from its external surface.

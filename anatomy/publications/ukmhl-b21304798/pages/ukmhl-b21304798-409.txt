iVont of the os ailcis to the outside of the oÂ» uavicularc. The articulation between the os calcis and os cu- boides has a synovial membrane, and is secured by a superior and an inferior ligament. The Superior or Dors.4L Lig-ament consists of short parallel fibres e.\tending across from the up].er and front part of the os calcis to the upper rough surface of the os cuboides. The Inferior or Plantar Ligament is the longest and the strongest of the ligaments of the tarsus. It arises from the under concave surface of the os calcis, and proceeds horizontally forwards in a diverging man- ner. Some of its fibres arc inserted into the os cuboi- des, others are continued forwards and inserted into the tarsal ends of the third and fourth nretatarsal bones. It may be observed that the articulation between the os calcis and the os culioides is very nearly in the same transverse line with that between the astragalus and the os naviculare. 'I'hc opposite sides of the Os Cuboides and Os Navi- culare are generally covered by cartilage and by synovial membrane. Occasionally, however, no dis- tinct articulation is here formed, and tiie two bones are joined by ligamentovis libres passing between them. They are further connected above and below by ligamentous bands passing across from one bone to the other. 'I'he articulation between the os cuboid* s and third tfuneiform bone has a distinct synovial membranej

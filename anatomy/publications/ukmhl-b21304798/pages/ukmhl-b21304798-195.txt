159 up the front of the neck. Some of these open into the external jugular, and others into the internal jugular trunks. It may be remarked, that occasionally there will be no large vein found pursuing the course of the ex- ternal jugular, as here described, but some smaller branches only will be discovered ramifying irre- gularly between the platisma and mastoid muscles. When the platisma myoidcs is reflected, two nerves are brought into view, which are remarkable only for their size. These are derived from the se- cond and third pairs of the cervical nerves. One of them ascends along the posterior border of the mas- toid muscle, and terminates above in filaments, which are distributed to the integuments covering the side and back part of the head. The other ascends obliquely upon the mastoid to its upper part and front edge, where it ends in filaments, distributed to the parotid gland, and to the external ear.' A very firm cellular tissue connects all the parts in the neck. In the progress of the dissection, this cellular tissue will be found penetrating inwards be- tween the muscles, vessels and m rves, so as to form sheaths around them ; and in dissecting away this tissue, we necessarily, at the same time, re- move the absorbent glands, which are placed be" tween its layers. The Absorbent Glands of the neck are very numerous. Some of them are placed superficially between the platisma and mastoid muscles, but the

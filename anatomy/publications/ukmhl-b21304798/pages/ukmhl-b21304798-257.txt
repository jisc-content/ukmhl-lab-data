221 L 3 course upwards, it proceeds behind the left subcla- vian artery into the neck. Here it ascends close upon the longus colli muscle, as high as the sixth cervical vertebra, and then turns forwards, and a little downwards, to terminate either at the back part of the internal jugular or subclavian vein, or precisely at the angle of union between the two. Upon slitting open the vein anteriorly opposite to the termination of the duct, two membranous folds, serving the pur- pose of valves, will be seen placed around its ori- fice. The thoracic duct is frequently tortuous in its cburse through the chest, and its diameter varies a little at different parts. About the middle of the chest it frequently splits into several branches, which soon unite again into one trunk, and at its termination it sometimes divides into two or three branches, which open separately into the internal jugular or subcla- vian veins near their union. Each branch is fur- nished with a distinct valve at its termination. A second principal trunk of the absorbent system is usually found on the right side of the neck, ter- minating in the angle of union between the right internal jugular and the right subclavian veins. Its size is nearly equal to that of the thoracic duct. Of the Sympathetic Nerve in the Chest. The sympathetic nerve in the chest consists of twelve small ganglia placed beneath the pleura upon the heads of the ribs, with connecting filaments passing between them. In the dissection of the neck it was

393 VVe here conclude the examination of the parts which are usually exposed in the dissection of the brain from above downwards, and must next proceed to the Basis. If we begin at the front part of the basis, the first object here noticed is the junction of the optic nerves, which will hereafter be particularly described. Im- mediately behind this junction, there is a small square portion of grey substance with which the infundi- bulum and pituitary gland are connected. The Infundibulum is, as already stated, a conical process of grey substance. Its length is about half an inch. It is broad above, where it is connected with the square portion of grey substance just mentioned. Thence proceeding downwards, and gradually contracting, it ends in a point which is at- tached to the, middle of the upper surface of the pituitary gland. The Pituitary Gland is a small body lodged in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. It is of a rounded or oval form, and has its upper surface flattened. It is generally of a dark-brown or yellowish colour, and is composed of two distinct substances which seem to be peculiar, as they do not exactly resemble the other parts of the brain. The pituitary gland is not joined to the brain in any other way than by its connexion wdth the infundibulum. Behind the square portion of grey substance, there are two small convex eminences, which are named the Corpora Albicantia, or Mammillaria. s5

119 the two vasti. From the lower part of the crurseus, a flat tendon proceeds downwards, between the vasti and behind the tendon of the rectus, to be attached to the upper edge of the patella. These three muscles, the two vasti and cruraeus, form but one mass of flesh, covering the front and sides of the femur, nearly in its whole length. It is only at their commencement above, that a distinct separation can be traced between them. At their insertions, the tendons of the three muscles, and the tendon of the rectus, are all intimately connected. When the muscles proceeding from the pelvis to the inside of the thigh are removed, the origin of the obturator externus will be brought into view from the front of the os pubis and the external surface of the obturator ligament. t

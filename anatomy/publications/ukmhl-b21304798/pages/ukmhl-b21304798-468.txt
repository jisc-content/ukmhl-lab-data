ternal surface; a fine transparent membrane forms the internal surface, over which tlie circulating blood flows; and between these, is the muscular substance. Immediately beneath the reflected pericardium, more or less fat is usually deposited. Generally it is more abundant at the basis, and on the right side of the heart. In some instances, it has been found an inch thick over the whole of the right ventricle. The Auricles and Ventricles are furnished with muscular fibres proportionate to the power they re- quire in the execution of their functions. The sides of the auricles are so thin in some situations, that they are transparent. The sides of the right ventricle are much thinner than the sides of the left. The first are generally about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and the latter about half an inch. These proportions are not, however, uniformly exact. OF THE VESSELS OF THE H â€˜';T. The Heart is supplied by two arteries, denominated Coronary, which are the first branches given off by the Aorta. They arise from ojjposite sides of the aorta just above the loose edges of the semilunar valves. One of them, named the Right, or An- terior Coronary Artery, proceeds transversely between the right auricle and ventricle, and round the flattened surface ot the heart, until it reaches the groove between the ventricles. It then turns down-

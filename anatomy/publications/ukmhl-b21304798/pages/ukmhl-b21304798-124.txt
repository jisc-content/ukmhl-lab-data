88 The Transversi Perinei, extending across the perineum. The Sphincter Ani, Levatores Ani, and CoccYGEi muscles, which correspond in their course to the same muscles in the male. The Erector Clitoridis muscle is smaller than the erector penis of the male, but in every other respect, resembles it. Arising from the inside of the tuber ischii, it ascends and passes forwards, to be inserted tendinous into the lower part of the crus clitoridis. The Sphincter Vaginje, arising above from the body of the clitoris, descends on each side of the vagina, surrounding its anterior extremity immediately behind the labia, and terminates below in the centre of the perineum, where its fibres are inter- mixed with those of the sphincter ani, and of the transversi perinei. i The Transversus Perinei arises from the tuber ischii, and proceeds across to the centre of the perineum where its fibres are intermixed with those of the op- posite muscle, and with the fibres of the sphincter vaginm above, and sphincter ani below. This mus- cle is usually not so distinct as in the male, and sometimes it is altogether wanting. The Sphincter Ani diflers from the same muscle in the male only in the circumstance of its connexion above with the fibres of the sphincter vaginae. The Levator Ani descends by the side of the vagina in its course to the rectum, but this muscle

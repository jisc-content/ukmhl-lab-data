91 uterus, whence it is continued upwards upon the cervix and body to the superior edge or fundus of the uterus, and thence downwards upon the posterior part of the organ. The uterus is thus included be- tween two layers of peritoneum. From the lower and back part of the cervix uteri, the peritoneum is continued downwards upon the posterior side of the vagina in the upper half of its extent, and is thence reflected backwards to the front of the rectum, leaving a loose pouch between the two organs. By passing the hand downwards between the vagina and rectum, it will readily enter the peritoneal pouch, which is similar to that left between the bladder and rectum in the male. The peritoneum extending to the rectum, invests the gut pre- cisely in the same manner as in the male subject. From the lateral edges of the uterus, the two layers of peritoneum, covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of the organ, are extended outwards to the walls of the pelvis on each side, forming the Broad Ligaments of the Uterus. Between these layers which constitute the broad ligaments, there are enclosed the Ovary, with its Ligament, and the Fallopian Tube and the Round Ligament, with the vessels and nerves distributed to these parts. From the manner in which each broad ligament is extended across from the lateral edge of the uterus, to the side of the pelvis, it will be observed that the uterus, together with its broad ligaments, forms a complete partition, extending transversely across the

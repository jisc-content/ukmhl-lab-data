152 divides itself into four branches, which are distri- buted to the toes. ORIGINS AND INSERTIONS OF THE MUSCLES IN THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. The Abductor Pollicis Pedis arises from the lower and back part, and from the inside of the os calcis, also from an aponeurotic expansion, which ' extends across from the os calcis to the inner ancle. Its fibres pass obliquely into a tendon, which is united to the flexor brevis pollicis, and proceeding for- wards with it, is attached to the posterior part, and in- side of the first phalanx of the great toe. The Flexor Brevis Digitorum Pedis Per- FORATUs arises from the under part of the pro- jection of the os calcis, and forms a thick fleshy belly ending in four tendons, which pass forwards to the toes, and there enter the fibrous sheaths with the tendons of the flexor longus. Within these sheaths the tendons of the flexor brevis divide to allow the tendons of the flexor longus to pass through them. N Each tendon of the flexor brevis uniting again after its division becomes attached by a bifurcated ex- tremity to the sides of the second phalanx of the four lesser toes. The Abductor Minimi Digiti Pedis arises from the undcj' part and external side of the os calcis, close to the projection of the heel. Its fibres

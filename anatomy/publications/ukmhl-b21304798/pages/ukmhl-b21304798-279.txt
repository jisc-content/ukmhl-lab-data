243 M 2 whicli distribute themselves upon all the surrounding parts, and have many communications with the branches of the facial nerve. A Branch of the Inferior Maxillary, which is the third division of the fifth pair of the cerebral nerves, passes out of the foramen mentale upon the face, and immediately divides into numerous fila- ments which communicate with those of the facial nerve. It may be observed, that few, if any, filaments of communication can be traced betw^een the nerves be- longing to the opposite sides of the face. The Frontal Nerve, which is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, forming the first division of the fifth pair of the cerebral nerves, passes through the superciliary notch, where it may be readily discovered by dividing the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. The nerve sometimes splits into two branches before its passage through the notch, and immediately after it emerges upon the forehead, it divides into several branches, some of which are distributed to the muscles and integuments of the forehead, others penetrating the occipito-frontalis, are distributed superficially upon the upper part of the head almost as far as the occiput. The deep-seated parts of the face are supplied by the Superior and Inferior INIaxillary Nerves, which will be described with the general distribution of the cerebral nerves.

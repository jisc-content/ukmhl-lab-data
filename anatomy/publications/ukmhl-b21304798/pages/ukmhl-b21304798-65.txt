29 c 3 upper part into the Colon, which constitutes the whole tract of large intestine from the coecum to the rectum. That portion of the colon, which ascends on the right side, is denominated the Ascending or Right Lumbar Colon ; that portion ex- tended across the abdomen, the Transverse Arch ; and the descending portion, on the left side, the Dkscending or Left Lumbar Colon. In the left iliac fossa, the colon has turns re- sembling the letter S, hence this portion is deno- minated the Sigmoid Flexure. The peritoneal connexions of the large intestines fix them in their situation, but not with equal firm- ness in every part of their course. Some portions of tlie gut receive a complete covering of peritoneum, while others are only partially invested by the mem- brane. The coecum and ascending portion of the colon generally receive a covering of peritoneum only on that side which is anterior and exposed to view in the cavity of the abdomen. On the posterior side, they are firmly united by cellular tissue to the iliac and lumbar muscles. In some subjects, however, the coecum and ascending colon are completely sur- rounded by the peritoneum so as to be confined more loosely to the parts behind, and a small fold of peritoneum is sometimes left behind the ascending colon, which is denominated the Right Lumbar Mesocolon or Right Ligament of the Colon. The descending colon is covered by the perito-

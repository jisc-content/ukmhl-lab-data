145 tendon, which passing obliquely backwards and in- Avards, is connected with the outer edge of the external semilunar cartilage, and is covered by the synovial membrane of the joint, which is reflected over it to the commencement of its fleshy fibres. Becoming fleshy it proceeds obliquely downwards and imvards, and terminates by an attachment to the triangular sur- face in the upper and back part of the tibia. This muscle is covered by a thin aponeurotic expansion. A fascia now presents itself coverinij; the more deep-seated muscles, vessels, and nerves. Upon the removal of this fascia, three muscles are brought into view. The Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis situated upon the posterior surface of the fibula. The Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis situated upon the posterior surface of the tibia. The Tibialis Posticus placed between the two preceding muscles, and partly concealed by them. The Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis arises from the posterior surface of the fibula, and from the apo- neurotic partitions separating it on one side from the peronei, and on the other from the tibialis post'cus and flexor longus digitorum. Its origin beginning just below the head of the fibula, extends almost to the lower end of the bone, where it ends in a tendon which, passes through a superficial groove in the back part and bottom of the tibia. The tendon is then reflected forwards into the sole of the foot beneath the os calcis and through a groove in the astragalus.

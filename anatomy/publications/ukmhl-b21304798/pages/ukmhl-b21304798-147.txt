Ill ternus muscle. The whole length of the sheath is about three inches. At about one third from the lower end of the femur the artery quits the sheath, and enters the opening between the tendons of the adductors into the ham. Besides the artery, the femoral vein and the branch of the crural nerve, denominated the Nervus Saphenus, are lodged in this sheath. I'he femoral vein formed by the continuation of the popliteal vein from the ham, proceeds up the thigh, first behind, and rather towards the outer side of the femoral artery. Then changing its direction, .the vein passes gradually towards the inner side of the artery, in which situation it is found at the upper part of the thigh from the point where it receives the saphena to its passage beneath Poupart’s liga- ment into the abdomen. The femoral artery and vein are surrounded and closely connected in their whole course by con- densed cellular tissue, and immediately below Pou- part’s ligament, they are enclosed between the portion of fascia which is extended downwards from the fascia iliaca, and that part of the fascia lata which terminates in the semilunar edge. The vessels arc not, however, completely covered in front by the fascia lata, a small part of the femoral vein on its inner side is covered only by the condensed cellular tissue just mentioned. If the handle of a knife is passed behind the femoral vessels so as to raise them, it will be seen that the production of the fascia iliaca

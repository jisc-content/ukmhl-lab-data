247 M 4 and is discharged by numerous minute holes, ar- ranged in a line along the edge of each tarsus. Its use is to anoint the edges of the lids. The Lacrymal Parts of the Eye consist of the Lacrymal Gland, which secretes the tears ;—of the Puncta Lacrymalia, and Ducts, into w'hich the tears pass from the lids and from the globe ;-Lof the La- crymal Sac, which receives the tears from the la- crymal ducts ;—of the Nasal Duct, which conveys them from the sac downwards into the nose; and lastly, of the Lacrymal Caruncle, which is subservient in its unctions to the preceding parts. The Lacrymal Gland is placed within the orbit, at its upj?er and outer part, beneath the fossa in the orbitar plate of the frontal bone. The gland may be readily discovered, either by dividing the in- teguments of the upper eyo-lid, and then dissecting towards the cavity of the orbit, between the upper tarsus and the supra-orbitary ridge, or by dividing the conjunctiva uniting tlie upper tarsus to the globe, and then drawing the eye a little forwards. The gland is of a yellowish -white colour, and of an oval and flattened figure, and is connected with the surrounding parts by loose cellular tissue. It is composed of numerous small portions united by cellular tissue. Its excretory ducts are so small in the human subject that they are not easily discovered. Their number is from six to eight. They leave the gland along its front edge, and descending between the tarsal ligament and the

252 intermixed with those of the orbicularis oris. Fat i? closely intermixed with the fibres of this muscle ren- dering it difficult of dissection, and the fibres are united with the ascending fibres of the platisma myoides. Beneath the integuments of the cheek and the zy- gomatic muscles, there is a very considerable quan- tity of soft fat. When this fat is removed, a broad and thin muscle is brought into view, w'hich is ex- tended between the two jaws, and is denominated The Buccinator. It arises above from the sur- face of the upper jaw, behind the last grinding tooth, and from the extremity of the pterygoid process ; below, from the external side of the lower jaw, be- tween the last grinding tooth and the coronoid pro- cess, and in the middle, from a ligament which is extended between the two jaws. Its fibres proceed from these origins forwards to the corner of the mouth where they terminate beneath the elevator and de- pressor muscles by being intermixed with the fibres of the orbicularis oris. The inner surface of the buc- cinator is covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth, and the muscle is perforated by the duct of the parotid gland in the situation which will be pre- sently mentioned. Around the opening of the mouth is The Orbicularis Oris muscle. This is formed partly by the insertions of the several muscles of the lips which have been described, and partly by two distinct strata of fibres which are placed around the loose edges of the lips, and decussate with each other

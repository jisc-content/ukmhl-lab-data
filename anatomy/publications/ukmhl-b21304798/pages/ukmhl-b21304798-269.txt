233 at the angles of the mouth. The orbicularis oris is closely united to the skin, and on its inner side, is covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth. By drawing the upper lip forwards and upwards, and carefully dissecting through the mucous mem-r brane on either side of the fraenum which unites the lip to the gums, a small muscle will be brought into view, which is The Depressor Labii Superioris Al^eque Nasi. It arises from the superior maxillary bone just above the sockets of the incisor teeth, and pro- ceeding upwards, terminates partly in the ala nasi, and partly in the upper lip. By drawing the lower lip downwards and forwards, and dissecting through the mucous membrane in the same situation on either side of the fraenum, a similar muscle will be brought into view, which is The Levator Labii Inferioris. It arises from the lower jaw just below the socket of the cuspidatus tooth, and descending inwards, terminates in the cel- lular tissue and skin of the chin. Of the Parotid Gland. The situation of the parotid gland is in the next place to be examined. This is the largest of the salivary glands, and derives its name from being placed near the ear. It is im- mediately exposed by the reflection of the integuments, and appears as a large flattened mass somewhat of an oval form occupying the space between the masseter muscle in front which it partly covers, the external ear behind, the zygoma above, and the angle of the

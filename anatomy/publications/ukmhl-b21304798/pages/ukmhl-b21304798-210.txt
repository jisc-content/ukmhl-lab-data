174 Lyoideus muscle. At the lower part of the neck on the left side, the carotid lies close to the oesophagus where this tube projects from beneath the trachea. 'I'he carotid artery does not give off any branches until it has ascended so high in the neck as to be opposite to the upper margin of the thyroid car- tilage, when it divides into two arteries, which in the adult are nearly of equal size, the External and the Internal Carotid. The External Carotid rises at first in a pa- rallel direction with the internal carotid, and then ascends obliquely backwards beneath the posterior I’-ortion of the digastricus, into the space between the angle of the jaw and the car, where it is lodged, deeply bi neath the parotid gland. In this part of its course, the external carotid gives off several large branches, of which we may remark that there are many varieties in the mode of their origin. Tw’o of the branches frequently arise by a common trunk. In some subjects, there being no regular division of * the common carotid into external and internal, the blanches usually given off by the former all arise at one point from the side of the common trunk, and in other subjects, the external carotid consisting only of a short stem instead of a continued trunk, all the branches take their origin from the top of it. The branches of the external carotid are, the Superior Thyroid, the Lingual,the External Maxillary', the Ascending Pharyngeal, the Occipital, and the Posterior Auricular.

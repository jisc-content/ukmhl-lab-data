246 of thu skin, which is of a line texture ; of the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle ; and beneath these, of a thin plate of cartilage, named the Tarsus, which determines the figure of the lid. The posterior surface of the tarsus is lined by the con- junctiva. The cartilage of the upper eye-lid is the largest. It is broad in the middle, and gradually contracts towards either end, while the cartilage of the lower lid is nearly of uniform breadth throughout* The posterior margins of the tarsi arc united to the edges of the orbit by broad fibrous expansions, which arc named the Ligaments of the Tarsi. These ligaments are more distinct towards the temporal side of the eye ; and at the outer canthus, the fibres of the upper and lower tarsal ligaments arc interlaced so as to form a distinct band connecting the eye-lids, and thence extending outwards to the edge of the orbit. At the inner corner of the eye, the lids are connected by the tendon of the orbicularis palpebrarum, which arising from the nasal process of the superior maxil- lary bone, proceeds transversely to the commissure of tlie eye-lids, and here divides into tw'o portions, wliich are continued into the tarsi. Meibomian Glands. These are very small bodies of a while or yellowish colour, situated be- tween the posterior surface of each tarsus and the conjunctiva lining it. They are arranged in clusters, and arc more numerous in the uppcj- than in the lower lid. The secretion from these bodies is sebaceous.

53 loose cellular tissue. It is denominated either the crural or femoral ring, and it is through this space the viscera are protruded in the femoral hernia. For a more detailed account of these parts the student is referred to Mr. Lawrenceâ€™s Treatise on Ruptures. It now only remains for the student to examine the trunks of the principal vessels and nerves of the ab- domen, which are found at the back part of the cavity behind the peritoneum. The Aorta having passed from the chest into the abdomen through the interval left between the crura of the diaphragm, descends along the spine in a straight direction to the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into two branches of equal size, de- nominated the common iliac arteries. In the upper part of the abdomen, the aoita is separated from the vena cava inferior by the right crus of the diaphragm. Lower down, the aorta and vena cava approach each other so nearly, that the vein, when distended, covers the right side of the artery. T he followina are the branches which the aorta gives t-ff in the abdomen, arranged in the order of their origin. 1. Ihe Phrenic Arteries, which consist of two small branches arising from the aorta imme- diately after its entrance into the abdomen. They ascend in front of the crura to the great muscle of the diaphragm, where their ramifications are principally distributed. Around the external margin of the o 3

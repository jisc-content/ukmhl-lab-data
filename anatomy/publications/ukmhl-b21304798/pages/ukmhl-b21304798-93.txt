57 is much smaller than the superior mesenteric, arises rather from the left side of the front of the aorta, about an inch above its bifurcation. Its dis- tribution has been already described, page 40. 10. The Lumbar Arteries, which are five in number, arise from each side of the aorta, at right angles. They proceed transversely across the sides of the vertebrae to the transverse processes, where they divide into anterior branches, which are distributed to the psoas, quadratus, and abdominal muscles; and into posterior brancheg, which pass backwards, and are distributed upon the muscles of the spine. Branches of the lumbar arteries enter the spaces between the vertebrae on each side, through which the nerves pass out of the spine, and thus reach the membranes of the medulla spinalis, upon which they are distributed. Of the Common Iliac Arteries. Each common iliac artery beginning opposite to the fourth lumbar vertebra, proceeds obliquely outwards and downwards on the inside of the psoas magnus, to the junction of the ilium with the sacrum, where it terminates by dividing into two branches, which, in the adult, arc of about equal size, and are named the external and internal iliac. The internal iliac is also named the hypogastric. Between the common iliac artery and the psoas magnus muscle on each side, there is a small interspace, occupied by cellular tissue. On the right side, the common iliac artery crosses obliquely over the two common iliac i> 5

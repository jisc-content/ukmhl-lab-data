209 turned downwards and forwards, towards the left, where it corresponds to the interval between the car- tilages of the fifth and sixth ribs. The upper sur- face of the heart which is presented to view on opening the pericardium, is convex, while the oppo- site surface which rests upon that part of the peri- cardium attached to the central tendon of the dia- phragm, is flattened. The heart is fixed in its situa- tion by the large vessels attached to its basis, and by its connexion with the pericardium; but it must be remarked, that under the different circumstances of expiration and inspiration, and in the varied positions of the body, the heart deviates to a certain extent from the exact position here described. The student having made himself acquainted with the general situation of the contents of the thorax, must proceed in the next place to the dissection of the large vessels which are found at the superior part and middle of the cavity. By merely dissecting through the loose cellular tissue found in the upper and middle part of the chest, the two subclavian veins will be brought into view. In the dissection of the neck, the course of the subclavian veins has been described as far as the inner edge of the scalenus antic us muscle on each side, from which point the veins are immediately con- tinued into the chest. The Right Subclavian Vein is shorter, and usually smaller, than the left, and descends from the scalenus muscle almost in a strait direction through

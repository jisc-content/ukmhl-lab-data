79 bladder rises into tlie abdomen, between the perito- neum and the posterior surface of the abdominal muscles, and becomes of an oval form, with its largest end downwards. The front of the bladder is united to the ossa pubis by loose cellular tissue; and in the space between the lower part of the bladder and the rectum are found the vesiculas se- minales, and vasa deferentia. The upper part of the bladder is named its Fundus, and the lower, its Cervix, where the circumference of the organ con- tracts in a slight degree round the prostate gland. A fibrous cord, named the Urachus, arises from the centre of the fundus of the bladder, and ascend- ing between the peritoneum and the abdominal muscles to the umbilicus, there terminates by beins: intermixed with the fibres of the surrounding aponeu- roses. The bladder is in some measure fixed in its situation by a fibrous substance of a flattened form, which extends across from its neck to the lower and back part of the symphysis pubis. It is denominated the Anterior Ligament of the bladder, and is more or less distinct in different subjects. The Ureters descending from the back part of the abdomen to the sacro-iliac symphysis, proceed downwards and forwards in the cavity of the pelvis to the lower and back part of the bladder, where they terminate. They are placed exteriorly to the peri- toneum, and in their approach to the bladder, they cross the outer sides of the vasa deferentia. Each Â£ 4

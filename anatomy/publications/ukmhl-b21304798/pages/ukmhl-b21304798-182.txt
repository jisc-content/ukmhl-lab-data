146 the external and internal plantar arteries, which will be described with the dissection of the sole of the foot. The branches of the posterior tibial artery are 1. Small arteries which are distributed to the muscles and adjacent parts. 2. The Peroneal Artery, which varies much in size. It usually arises from the posterior tibial near its commencement, and thence descending im- mediately behind the fibula, is partly covered by the flexor longus pollicis. The peroneal gives off branches to the muscles, and at the lower part of the leg it di- vides into an anterior and posterior branch. The Peronea Anterior penetrates the interosseous ligament, and thus reaching the front of the leg, ends in branches which communicate freely with the anterior tibial. 'I'he Peronea Posterior, which is the larger branch, descends to the outer side of the os calcis, where it ends in communications with the posterior tibial. I'he Posterior Tibial Veins are two in number, accompanying the artery, one on each side. They terminate above in the popliteal vein. Two veins accompany the peroneal artery. These also open into the popliteal vein. The Posterior Tibial Nerve descends from the ham beneath the soleus, and accompanies the posterior tibial artery down the leg, the nerve being placed close to the artery on its outer or fibular side. From the lower part of the leg the nerve passes with the artery behind the malleolus mternus into Ine nuÂ»-

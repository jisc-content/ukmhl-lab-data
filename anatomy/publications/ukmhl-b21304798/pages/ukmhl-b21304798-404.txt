368 At the back part of the articulation arc seen the two Crucial Ligaments extended obliquely from the hollow between the condyles to the head of the tibia, and crossing each other in their course. It has been already stated that these ligaments are covered by the synovial membrane only on their front and lateral parts. Hence they are actually on the outside of the synovial sac. When we dissect them from the back part of the joint, we find them here united only by loose cellular tissue to the Ligamentum Posticum. The Anterior Crucial Ligament arises above from the inner side of the external condyle, and pro- ceeding obliquely downwards and forwards, is in* seited into a depression in the head of the tibia in ' front of the protuberance between its articular sur- faces. The Posterior Crucial Ligament arises above from the outer side of the internal condyle, and pro- ceeding obliquely downwards and backwards, divides into two distinct bands, one of which is inserted into a depression in the head of the tibia, behind its middle protuberance, and the other is connected with the external semilunar cartilage. The Semilunar Cartilages are placed upon the articular surfaces of the tibia. Each cartilage, in its external conve.x margin is thick, and becoming gradually thinner, its internal concave margin has a sharp delicate edge. Each cartilage presents above, an excavated surface adapted to the convexities of the condyles, and below, a flattened surface adapted to

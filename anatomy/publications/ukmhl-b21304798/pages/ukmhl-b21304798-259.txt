L 4 tenth and eleventh thoracic â€¢ ganglia. The filaments proceed obliquely forwards, and unite into a single nerve, which enters the abdomen through an open- ing in the lesser muscle of the diaphragm, and some- times in company with the preceding nerve. The distribution of the splanchnic nerves in the ab- domen will be described with the ganglia and plex- uses of the abdominal viscera. Of the Distribution of the Nerves of the Heart. In the dissection of the neck, it is seen that the nerves of the heart are derived from the cer- vicarganglia of the Sympathetic, a few communicating filaments being added to them by the par vagum and by the recurrent nerves. Five cardiac nerves result- ing from this union, descend from the neck into the chest, three on the right side, and two on the left, and unite into a plexus, which is placed at the pos- terior part of the arch of the aorta, just above its origin from the heart. From this cardiac plexus there proceed, 1. Anterior branches distributed to the front of the aorta. 2. Posterior branches joining the pulmonary plexuses. 3. Inferior branches which are the largest and most numerous. They are partly distributed upon the great vessels of the heart, and partly form an an- terior and posterior coronary plexus, which accom- pany the ramifications of the anterior and posterior

l6l passes out of the skull at the foramen jugulare, and descends some way along the neck, behind the in- ternal jugular vein.' It then turns outwards, and penetrates some of the fibres of the mastoid muscle near its posterior edge, and about one third from its upper end. The nerve is next continued backwards beneath the trape2ius muscle, where it ends in com- munications with the cervical nerves. Before the student proceeds further in the dis- section, it will be necessary that he should have a general knowledge of the parts which occupy the front and middle of the neck. At the upper part of the neck is the Os Hy- oiDES, so termed from its resemblance to the Greek v. The Os Hyoides is firmly united above, to the root of the tongue, by giving attachments to the principal muscles of the organ. It is divided into a basis placed in front, and into two cornua, which are extended backwards from the basis on each side. Just at the point where each cornu begins, two short processes rise perpendicularly from the bone. These are the lesser cornua. Below the Os Hyoides is the Larynx, which is formed by a series of highly elastic cartilages, con- nected by parts of a ligamentous and membranous structure. The uppermost of these cartilages is de- nominated The Thyroid Cartilagf. It is composed of two lateral portions or alas joined obliquely in front,

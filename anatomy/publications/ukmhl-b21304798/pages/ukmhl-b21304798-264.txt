SECT. II. MUSCLES OF THE FACE. The dissection of the face is to be commenced by exposing a thin and broad muscle, which surrounds the bony ridges of the orbits, and is continued from them upon the cartilages of the eyelids. The inte- guments are united to the muscular fibres by loose cellulai- tissue, in which fat is never deposited, and in emaciated subjects, the fibres are so pale and in- distinct as to require a very cautious dissection to ex- hibit them. The muscle is denominated The Orbicularis Palpebrarum. It arises on the inner side of the orbit, from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, from the superior maxil- lary bone along the front edge of the groove in which the lacrymal sac is lodged ; and, lastly, from a small round tendon, which is fixed to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Its fibres pass out- wards from these origins, and expand themselves upon the bony ridges of the orbit, and upon the cartilages of the upper and lower eye-lids. At the outer side of

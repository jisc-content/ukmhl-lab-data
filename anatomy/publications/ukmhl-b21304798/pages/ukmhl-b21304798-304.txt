268 which is connected with the cartilages of the al.e nasi. This cartilage is of a triangular foi’m. Its upper edge is united to the nasal lamella of the ethmoid bone, and its lower edge is received into the groove between the two plates of the vomer. The jiostrils terminate behind, in the pharynx, by two openings somewhat of an oval form, which are placed immediately over the velum palati, and are about an inch in length, and half an inch in width. These openings are separated by the posterior edge of the vomer, and are bounded externally on each side by the internal plate of the pterygoid process. The cavity of each nostril is divided into three passages, denominated the Meatus Narium. The inferior, which is the largest, includes the space be- tween the floor of the nostril and the os spongiosum inferius; the middle includes the space between the two ossa spongiosa, and the superior is situated above the back part of the os spongiosum su- per i us. The openings of the several sinuses, which are connected with the nose, will be found in the fol- lowing situations :— # The Frontal Sinuses terminate in the middle meatus of each nostril at its front part. The Sphenoidal Sinuses open into the superior meatus of each nostril at its back part. The Maxillary Sinuses open into the middle meatus of the nostrils, between the two spongy

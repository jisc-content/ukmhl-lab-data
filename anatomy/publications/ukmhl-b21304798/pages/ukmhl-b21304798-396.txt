360 Â» synovial raembrane is continued upon the articula- tion of the carpus with the metacarpus, and upon the articulations of the metacarpal bones of the fingers with each other. The three first bones of the carpus are joined by ligamentous bands passing between their contiguous sides. All the bones of the carpus are joined by ligamen- tous bands, passing across from oiie bone to the other, both in front and behind. Some of these bands are arranged transversely, and others ob- liquely. Tlie two rows of the carpal bones are further con- nected by an External and Internal Lateral Liga- ment. The former is extended between the os sca- phoides and os trapezium, the latter between the os cuneiforme and os unciforme. \ The os pisiforme, not being included in the ranks of the carpal bones, has no communication with their common joint. It is articulated to the os cunei- forme by cartilaginous surfaces covered by synovial membrane, and is fixed in its situation by ligamen- tous fibres, some of which proceed from it on one side to the os unciforme, and to the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and on the other side to the extre- mity of the ulna.

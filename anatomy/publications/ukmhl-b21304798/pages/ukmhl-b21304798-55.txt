19 Two incisions are next to be made through the pe- ritoneum, one extending down the middle and front of the abdomen, the other extending completely across from one side to the other, and intersecting the former at the umbilicus. The Peritoneum is a serous membrane, and like the other membranes of the same class, it forms a sac which is without opening, and contains only the secretion from its internal surface. The mem- brane lines the walls of the abdomen and pelvis, and is reflected upon the viscera of both these cavities in such a manner, that they receive from it a smooth covering, and are still completely on the outside of the sac. Various processes of the peritoneum are extended inwards between the viscera, connecting them, and forming duplicatures, between which the vessels and nerves lie imbedded in their passage to each organ. The viscera are attached to the back part of the abdomen, while in front, they are loose and un- connected, their smooth surfaces being here simply in contact with the peritoneum lining the walls of the cavity. The student must, in the first place, examine the situation of those organs which can be seen with- out the assistance of dissection, beginning with The Liver. This organ is placed in the upper part of the abdomen, where it occupies the whole of the right hypochondrium, and extends obliquely

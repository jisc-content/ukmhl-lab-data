* So5 cavity. In this way it is effected, that the tendon just mentioned is on the outside of the synovial mem- brane, although apparently within the cavity of the joint. Moreover, it will be remarked, that by the reflection of the synovial membrane from the lower part of the bicipital groove to the tendon, a sort of cul de sac is formed round the latter, by which the escape of synovia from the cavity of the joint is pre- vented. The layer of cartilage covering the head of the humerus is thicker in the centre than at the circum- ference, while the cartilaginous covering of the glenoid cavity is thickest at its edges. The glenoid cavity is increased in depth by a border of fibrous substance attached to its external edge. This fibrous substance is connected above with the tendon of the biceps. ARTICULATION OF THE HUMEKUS WITH THIi RADIUS AND ULNA. The ligaments belonging to this articulation are An Internal Lateral Ligament, which ir fixed above to the internal condyle of the humerus, and thence descending in a radiated manner, it divides into an anterior and a posterior portion ; the anterior portion is attached to the inside of the coronoid pro- cess of the ulna ; the posterior portion is attachcii tÂ» the inside of the olecranon.

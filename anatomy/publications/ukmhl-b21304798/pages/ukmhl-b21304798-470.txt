In order to make a complete examination of the structure and connexions of the larynx, it will be ne- cessary to remove it from the body with the os hyoides and the upper part of the trachea attached to it. In the dissection of the neck, w'e have described the form of the os hyoides, and its connexions with the root of the tongue. The os hyoides is further fixed above, to the basis of the skull, by two Ligaments, which descend from the styloid process forwards and inwards, to llie lesser cornua of the bone ; and below, it is fixed by ligaments, and by membrane to the larynx. The Ligaments are two in number, of a con- siderable length and rounded form. They proceed from the extremities of the os hyoides directly down- wards to tlie superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The membrane occupies the space between the liga- ments, and descends from the os hyoides to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It is of a soft cellular nature, and is thicker in front than at the sides.

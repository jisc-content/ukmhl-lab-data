106 not only gives the muscles a covering externally, but at the outer side and back part of the thigh, sends processes inwards, forming partitions between them. In the front of the thigh, the fascia is attached above to Poupart’s ligament, and to the ante rior edge of the os pubis. Behind, it begins as high as from the ex- ternal border of the crista of the ilium, and has a firm and broad attachment to the tendon of the glu- tzeus maximus, and some of its fibres gradually arise upon the muscle itself. In tracing the fascia down- wards, we find it firmly united in front with the ten- don of the rectus muscle, and behind, it is continued from the lower part of the thigh over the back of the knee joint, and is joined to the fascia of the leg. In various parts of the fascia lata, small apertures are seen for the passage of vessels and nerves, and just below Poupart’s ligament, there is a considerable interval where the vena saphena major joins the femoral vein. This interval is formed by the division of the fascia into two portions, which have the distinct attach- ments already noticed, one to the front of PouparPs ligament, the other to the front edge of the os pubis. That portion of the fascia attached to Poupart’s ligament, presents a crescent-shaped edge, *^he con- cavity of which is directed towards the pubes, and is denominated either its semilunar edge or falciform process. If this semilunar edge of the fascia is ^traced downwards, it will be found continued into a second semilunar edge, the concavity of which is

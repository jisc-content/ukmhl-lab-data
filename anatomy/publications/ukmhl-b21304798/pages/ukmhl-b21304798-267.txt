231 the face from the os malae to the corner of the mouth. These are the Zygomaticus Major and Minor. The latter, however, is frequently wanting. The Zygomaticus Major is the outermost of the two. It arises from the convex and projecting part of the os malae, and descends obliquely inwards to the corner of the mouth, where it is intermixed with the Orbicularis Oris, and with the other muscles of the lips. The Zygomaticus Minor arises from the os malae on the inside of the preceding, and proceeds in the same direction to the corner of the mouth. A flattened and- triangular muscle is extended be- tween the corner of the mouth, and the basis of the lower jaw at its side. This is The Depressor Anguli Oris. It arises broad from the external edge of the lower jaw just above its basis, and ascends, gradually contracting in breadth as it approaches the corner of the mouth, where it is intermixed with the Zygomaticus Major, Levator Anguli, and Orbicularis Oris. The outer edge of this muscle is united to the fibres of the Platisma Myoides, which ascend upon the face. On the inside of the preceding muscle, and partly covered by it, is The Depressor Labii Inferioris. It arises broad from the front and side of the lower jaw, a little above its basis, and proceeding obliquely up- wards and inwards, unites with the opposite muscle, and terminates in the lower lip where its fibres are

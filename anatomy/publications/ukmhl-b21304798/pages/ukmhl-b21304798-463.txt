427 which arc connected with the tricuspid valve, there are others extended between the carnece columnse in various parts of the ventricle. The office of the tri- cuspid valve is to prevent any reflux of blood from the ventricle into the auricle. When the amide con- tracts upon its blood, the loose portions of the valve lie flat upon the sides of the ventricle, and present no impediment to the entrance of the blood into its cavity. When, on the other hand, the ventricle con- tracts, the loose portions of the valve are raised by the blood, and meet in the centre of the annulus ve- nosus, so as completely to All the opening. The chordre tendineae, from their unyielding nature, will not allow the tricuspid valve to be carried farther backwards towards the auricle than the level of the annulus venosus. Of the three large portions of the tricuspid valve, that which is turned towards the pulmonary artery is the largest, and, indeed, is of sufficient extent to cover the opening of the artery, when the valve lies flat against the side of the ven- tricle, during the passage of the blood into it from the auricle. A second incision is now to be made through the anterior side of the right ventricle, along the line of its union with the septum ventriculorum, from the apex, directly upwards into the Pulmonary Artery. The Pulmonary Artery arises from the upper part and left side of the right ventricle. At the entrance of the artery, there are three Semilunar, or Sig-

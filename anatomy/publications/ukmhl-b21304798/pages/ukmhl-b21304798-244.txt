208 below, the pericardium is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm by cellular tissue, which, in the adult, unites them so firmly that they cannot be separated without injury. By laying open the pericardium, we shall be enabled to observe the mode of its connexion with the heart. 0 The size of the bag is so much larger than that of the heart, as to admit the free motion of this organ within it. There is always a proportion between the size of the pericardium and that of the heart; hence, if in the dead subject, the former appears dispro- portionally large, it must be attributed to the empty and contracted state of the cavities of the latter organ. The pericardium becomes attached to the large vessels a little above the basis of the heart, and is then continued downwards upon the vessels and over the whole surface of the heart itself. The heart and its large vessels, for a small part of their course, thus receive a smooth covering from a reflection of the pericardium, and are still placed on the outer side of the bag. The external surface of the heart formed by the reflected pericardium, and the internal surface of that part of the membrane which forms the bag surrounding the heart, are moistened during life by a serous fluid. After death this moisture is col- lected into a small quantity of transparent water within the pericardium, which is denominated the Liquor Pericardii. The Heart is placed obliquely in the chest with its broadest part, or basis, turned upwards and back- wards, towards the right side, and with its apex

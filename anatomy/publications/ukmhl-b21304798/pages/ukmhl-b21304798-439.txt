403 The two anterior cerebral arteries communicate by a transverse branch extending across the fissure be- tween the anterior lobes. The Middle Cerebral Artery proceeds out- wards through the fissura Sylvii in its whole length to the posterior lobe, and distributes its branches to the surrounding parts of the brain. The Vertebral Artery penetrates the dura mater, and enters the skull through the foramen mag- num. It then ascends between the basilar process of the occipital bone, and the side of the medulla ob- longata to the tuber annulare. Here the two vertebral arteries unite into one trunk, which is the Basilar Artery. The vertebral artery usually gives off the following branches within the skull before the forma- tion of the basilEir artery : (a) . An Anterior and Posterior Spinal Artery. The first descends upon the front, and the latter upon the back part of the medulla spinalis. They extend along the medulla nearly in its whole length, and communicate freely with the arteries en- tering the spinal canal through the holes by which the nerves pass out of it. (b) An Inferior Cerebellar Artery, which distributes its branches principally to the inferior sur- face of the cerebellum. The Basilar Artery, commencing at the fis- sure between the medulla oblongata and the tuber annulare, proceeds along the groove in the middle of the anterior surface of the tuber to its upper border.

437 and proceeding obliquely upwards and backwards, is inserted into the outer and front part of the basis of the arytaenoid cartilage. Closely connected with the preceding is, The TiiYRO-ARYTiENOiDEUs, which arises from the lower part of the inside of the thyroid cartilage, near the angle formed by the junction of the aim, and proceeding backwards and outwards, is inserted into the front of the arytaenoid cartilage. The interval between the arytaenoid cartilages is filled by muscular fibres which arise from the pos- terior concave surface of one cartilage, and are in- serted into the corresponding surface of the other. Some of these fibres are oblique, and others trans- verse. Hence they are described as two muscles, by the names of Arytjenoideus Obliquus and Trawsversus. The oblique fibres are superficial, and cross obliquely from the basis of one cartilage to the apex of the other, so that they decussate. Other muscular fibres, which arc not always to be found, are described by the names of Thyro-Epi- GLOTTICUS and ARYTiENO-EpiGLOTTICUS. > The raucous glands of the larynx are found in two distinct situations. Between the lower part of the epiglottis and the membrane uniting the os hyoidcs to the thyroid cartilage, there is a triangular space which is occupied by a mass of mucous glands im- bedded in fat. The ducts from these glands pass through numerous apertuies in the epiglottis. Other

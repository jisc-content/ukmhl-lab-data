254 tendon, which passes through a cartilaginous pulley before it proceeds to its insertion. This pulley is formed by a piece of cartilage, which is fixed by ligamentous fibres to the upper and inner side ot the orbit, and is lined by synovial membrane, which is continued upon the tendon of the trochlearis as far as its insertion into the globe. The tendon having passed through this pulley, turns a little backwards and outwards, and proceeding beneath the rectus su- perior is inserted into the upper and back part of the sclerotica, at about the mid-distance between the in- sertion of the rectus superior and the optic nerve. The Obliquus Inferior arises in front from the anterior edge of the orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone near the groove in which the lacry- mal sac is lodged, and proceeds obliquely outwards and backwards beneath the rectus inferior. Then turning upwards between the rectus externus and the globe, it is inserted into the upper and outer part of the sclerotica, rather nearer to the optic nerve than the insertion of the obliquus superior. OF THE VESSELS OF THE EYE. The Opiithalmic Artery, which is a branch of the Internal Carotid, passes through the foramen opticum into the orbit. The artery is first placed on the outer side of the optic nerve, but soon crosses obliquely over the nerve to the inner side of the orbit.

60 ascend between the Abdominal muscles, where they communicate with the lumbar, intercostal, and mam- mary arteries. At the back part of the ilium the cir- cumflexa ilii communicates with the ilio-lumbalis artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac. The distribution of the internal iliac artery will be described with the dissection of the viscera of the pelvis. The Vena Cava Inferior is formed by the union of the two common iliac veins, each of which consists of the united external and internal iliac veins. The External Iliac Vein is the continuation of the trunk of the femoral vein passing beneath Pou- partâ€™s ligament into the abdomen. It proceeds ob- liquely upwards and inwards to the sacro-iliac sym- physis, exactly in the same direction with the corre- sponding artery. The external iliac vein receives in this course the circumflexa ilii and epigastric veins corresponding to the arteries of the same name. The Internal Iliac Vein ascending from the cavity of ihc pelvis, joins the external iliac vein at the sacro-iliac symphysis, and thus forms the com- mon iliac vein. The Common Iliac Veins proceed obliquely upwards and inwards, and unite to form the vena cava between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra?. The vein on the right side is placed immediately behind the corresponding artery, while the left vein is placed rather below and on the inside of the artery. The Vena Cava ascends in a straight direction

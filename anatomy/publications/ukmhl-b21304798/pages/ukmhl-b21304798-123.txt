87 roundish form, and its margin is thick and pro- minent. Immediately below the meatus urinarius is the opening of the Vaoina, the size and appearance of which vary considerably under different circum- stances. In the virgin, the diameter of the opening is diminished by a membranous duplicature deno- minated the Hymen, which is usually crescent- shaped, with its concavity turned upwards, and has its convex edge attached to the lower part and sides of the vagina. After the rupture of the hymen, several flesh)' eminences of a reddish or livid colour are seen about the orifice of the vagina. These are named CARUNCur .Â®: Mv rtiformes, and they have been generally regarded as the remains of the lacerated hymen. It has, however, been remarked, that some of these fleshy eminences exist previously to the rupture of the membrane. All the parts in the pu- dendum are covered by a membrane abundantly sup- plied with mucus from the orifices of numerous ducts, some of which are seen above and at the sides of the urethra, and others at the sides of the vagina. The integuments of the perineum and around the orifice of the vagina are now to be removed, when the following muscles will be brought into view. The Erectores Clitoridis covering the crura of the clitoris. The Sphincter Vagin.e surrounding the ori- fice of the vagina.

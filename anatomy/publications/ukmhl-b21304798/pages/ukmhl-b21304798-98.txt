G2 ber, and arise, one from each rCfial capsule. They sometimes terminate in the renal veins. 5. The Hepatic Veins, which return the blood from the liver. They consist of two or three, large veins which open into the vena cava just before it penetrates the diaphragm, and of some smaller branches, irregular in their number, which open into the vena cava in different parts of its course beneath the liver. 6. Two Diaphragmatic Veins returning the blood from the diaphragm. The Vena Azygos begins in the abdomen by some small veins which communicate with the renal and lumbar veins, and sometimes directly with the vena cava. They unite into a single trunk which generally passes through a perforation in the fibres of the lesser muscle of the diaphragm into the chest; but, in some subjects, it passes through the same opening with the aorta and the thoracic duct. The Thoracic Duct begins in the abdomen upon the second or third lumbar vertebra by the junction of many absorbent trunks which are formed by the absorbents of the lower extremities, and of the pelvis, and by the absorbents of the mesentery, which are denominated the lacteals. At its commencement the thoracic duct is usually rather enlarged in size where the trunk of the lacteals opens into it, and this dilated part of the duct is called the Receptaculum Chyli. Frequently, however, the duct is here no

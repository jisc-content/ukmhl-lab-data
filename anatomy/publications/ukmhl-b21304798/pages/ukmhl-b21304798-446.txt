410 rior portion proceed the Dental and Lingual Nerves. 1. The Temporal Nerves are usually two in number. They ascend to the temporal muscle in which they arc distributed. 2. The Masseteric Nerve is of large size. It passes between the temporal muscle and the condyle of the jaw, to the internal surface of the masseter muscle, in which it terminates. 3. The Buccal Nerve proceeds downwards and forwards between the pterygoid muscles to the bucci- nator muscle, in which its filaments are principally distributed. 4. The Pterygoid Nerve supplies the ptery- goideus inlernus muscle. 5. The Dental Nerve descends between the ptcrygoideus internus and the lower jaw, to the canal destined for it, with the accompanying artery and vein. The nerve passes through the canal, giving off filaments for the supply of the molarcs and bicuspides. When it reaches as far forwards in the canal as the foramen mentale, it divides into two branches; one of these continuing its course forwards, gives off fila- ments for the supply of the cuspidati and incisores, and the other passes through the foramen mentale to the face. 6. The Lingual Nerve, also named the Gustatory, descends between the ptcrygoideus in- ternus and the jaw, and then turns forwards; first, between the submaxillary gland and the mucous

382 *nd is flattened on its inner side, where it is in con- tact with the falx. I he whole of the exterior surface of the brain is formed into convolutions, which run in various di- rections. The clefts, or sulci, between the convo- lutions, generally penetrate the substance of the - brain to the depth of about an inch, or inch and a half. In a section of the brain, the greater number of these sulci are observed to have a zigaag course ; some of them run longitudinally, and others obliquely. In some situations the sulci terminate in communica- tions with each other, and in others, they terminate separately in the substance of the brain. The brain is composed of two distinct kinds of substance, one of which has been usually denomi- nated Cortical, or Cineritious, or Grey, and tha other Medullary, or White. In a section of the hemisphere, it will be seen that the external surface of the convolutions is formed by a covering of grey sub- stance, about the tenth of an inch in thickness. When an incision is made into the white substance, its sur- face is spotted l>y red points. Those are produced by the division of the blood vessels, which will vary, both in their size and in their number, acct)rdinÂ» as they may be more or less distended by blood. W'c now proceed to the dissection of the brain, ac- cording to the plan usually adopted, when it is ex- amined for the purpose of ascertaining its healthy or diseased condition. The two Hemispheres of the Cerebrum are to be

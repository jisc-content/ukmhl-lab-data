8 cartilages of the ribs as low as the mid-distance be- tween the umbilicus and the os pubis. The inferior passes together with the anterior layer in front of the remaining fourth of the rectus to the linea alba. The internal oblique is now to be detached from the cartilages of the ribs, from the fascia lumborum, and from the crista ilii, and is to be reflected for- wards from the transversalis, beneath it, after the same manner as the external oblique. In de- taching the fibres of the internal oblique from the crista ilii, the student must look for a branch of the circumflexa ilii artery and its accompanying vein, which ramifying between the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, point out the separation between them. It should be remarked that the fibres of the internal oblique, where they arise from the outer half of Poupartâ€™s ligament, arc so closely united with the fibres of the transversalis beneath, that a distinct separation cannot easily be discovered. Hence the student need not attempt the reflection of the in- ternal oblique at its lower part beyond the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The Tuansversalis, or, Transversus abdo- minis, has its origin above from the internal surfaces of the cartilages of the seven lower ribs by distinct digitations, which intermix w-ith similar por- tions of the diaphragm; behind, by a broad and thick tendon, which is fixed to the lower edges of the eleventh and twelfth ribs, to the transverse processes

3(51 % t ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN THE CARPUS AND METACARPUS, AND BETWEEN THE META- CARPAL BONES. The articulation between the os trapezium and the metacarpal bone of the thumb has a distinct synovial membrane, and is surrounded by ligamentous fibres passing from one bone to the other. 3'hc articulations between the carpus and the me- tacarj)al bones of the fingers are covered, as already stated, by reflections of tiie synovial membrane of the caq)us. Numerous ligamentous bands pass in front and behind, between the lower row of the carpal bones and the ends of the metacarpal bones. The articulations between the contiguous sides of the metacarpal bones of the fingers, are covered by the refiectif)ns of the synovial membrane of the carpus. The metacarpal bones are connected at their car- pal ends by ligamentous bands passing transversely from one bone to the other, both in front and behind. Other ligamentous fibres pass between the metacar- j)al bones more deeply, uniting them very firmly to- gether. At their digital ends, the metacarpal bones arc united by transverse bands, which here exist only on their anterior, or palmar sides.

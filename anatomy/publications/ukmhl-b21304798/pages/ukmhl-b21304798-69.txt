33 c 5 placed to the right, the Hepatic Artery to the left, and the Vena Portse between, and rather behind the duct and the artery. The Ductus Communis Choledochus com- mences at the union of the ductus hepaticus, which arises from the liver, with the ductus cysti- cus, which is continued from the neck of the gall- bladder. The Ductus Hepaticus is about the size of a writing quill. It proceeds from beneath the liver obliquely downwards and forwards to the extent of an inch, or inch and a half, and is then joined by the ductus cysticus. The Ductus Cysticus is about equal in size to a large crow quill, and is continued from the neck of the gall-bladder in the following manner. The neck of the gall-bladder, bending obliquely up- wards, gradually contracts itself into the cystic duct, which turns downwards, so as to form a convexity towards the liver, and after a course of about an inch and a half it Joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle. The ductus choledochus, thus beginning at the union of the cystic and hepatic ducts, continues its course downwards, to terminate in the duodenum in a man- ner which will be hereafter mentioned. The Hepatic Artery is a branch of the coeliac, which will be brought into view by dissecting through the back part, and towards the lett side of the lesser omentum. The CtELiAC Artery arises from the fore

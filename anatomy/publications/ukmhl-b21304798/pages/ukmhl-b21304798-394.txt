and os trapezium. Neither of these lateral ligaments are well defined, their edges being irregularly con- nected with the ligamentous bands next described. Antkriou andPosteriorLigamentous Bands, which proceed from the front and back edges of the articular cavity of tbe radius, and are attached to the tirst or upper row of the carpal bones. An Interarticular Cartilage is placed between the extremity of the ulna and the bones of the carpus, wbich occupies the vacancy here seen in the skeleton. By this caitilage, the articulation between the forearm and the carpus is separated into an upper and lower division, each having a dis- tinct synovial membraiic. 'i'he upper division is formed by tbe extremity of the ulna above, and by the opposite surface of the interarticular cartilagC; be- low. The lower division constitutes the proper joint of the wrist, and is formed by the following parts;â€”The inferior articular surface of the radius, and the inferior surface of the cartilage just mentioned, present together a concavity, oblong, or elliptical transversely, which is adapted to the uniform con- vexity presented by the superior surfaces of the three first bones of the carpus, viz., the scaphoides, lunare, and cuneiforme. The synovial membrane, which belongs to the up- per division of this articulation, covers the extremity of the ulna and the upper surface of the interarticu- lar cartilage, and is reflected upwards, as already stated, into the articulation between the opposite sides

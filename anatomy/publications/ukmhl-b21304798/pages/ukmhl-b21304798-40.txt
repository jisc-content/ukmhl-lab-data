4 direction of the opening is obliquely upwards and outwards. Its figure is triangular, having its base formed by the os pubis, its sides by the two portions of the aponeurosis which are called the columns or pillars of the ring, and its apex by the upper and outer extremity. This, however, which is called its apex, will be found somewhat rounded off by ten- dinous fibres, which run from one column to the other, and are variously distinct in different subjects. Of the tw o portions of tendon which constitute the columns of the ring, the upper is fixed to the sym- physis pubis, where it meets, and is connected wdth the tendon of the opposite side, and the lower, repre- senting a roundish cord, which, in fact, constitutes Poupartâ€™s ligament, is fixed to the eminence of the os pubis denominated its spine or tuberosity. In the female, the crural arch is in a trifling degree longer, and the ring of the external oblique is considerably smaller, than in the male. In various parts of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, small apertures are left for the passage of vessels to the muscles beneath. The integuments of the abdomen are connected to the aponeurosis of the external oblique by common cellular and adipose tissue, but it is to be remarked, that, in some subjects, tins tissue is so abundant, and so dense in texture, that it may, without difficulty, be raised in a continuous layer. Hence it has been denominated the F.\sci.\ Supehficialis of the ab- domen. The student must remember thdt when the

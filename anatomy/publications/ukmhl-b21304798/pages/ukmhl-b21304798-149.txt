IIS the muscles on the back part of the thigh, where they communicate with the branches of the ischiatic and obturator arteries. The profunda gives off, (a) The External Circumflex, which arising from the outer side of the profunda soon after its origin, passes beneath the rectus and sartorius mus- cles, towards the trochanter major, and ends in branches distributed to the surrounding muscles, and communicating below with the articular arteries of the knee. (b) The Internal Circumflex, which arising from the inner side of the profunda opposite to the middle of the pectinalis, passes outwards and back- wards near to the os femoris, and ends in branches* distributed to the muscles surrounding the bone, and to the flexor muscles of the leg. They have free communications with the branches of the obturator artery. The circumflex arteries are sometimes branches of the femoral trunk. These are all the branches of the femoral artery which admit of distinct description, but in its whole course down the thigh it sends off other small branches to the surrounding parts. The Femoral Vein receives branches corre- sponding to the principal branches of the femoral artery; and a little below Poupartâ€™s ligament, it re- ceives the saphena, which has been already de- scribed.

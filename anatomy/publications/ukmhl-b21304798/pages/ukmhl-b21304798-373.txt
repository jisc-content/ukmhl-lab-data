The Interossei Interni are four in number, one placed on the outside of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger, the second between the metacarpal bones of the fore and middle ^ngers, the third between the middle and ring fingers, and the fourth between the ring and little fingers. They all arise from the opposite sides of the metacarpal bones at their car- pal ends, and send off distinct tendons, which pene- trate backwards between the fingers, to be inserted with the tendons of the lumbricales and of the exten- sor communis, into the phalanges of the fingers. The Interossei Externi, or Bicipites, are three in number, one placed between the metacarpal bones of the fore and middle fingers, the second be- tween the middle and ring fingers, and the third be- tween the ring and little fingers. They arise by double heads from the opposite sides of the metacarpal bones, and are inserted into the sides of the fingers with the tendons of The extensor communis digitorum. Q

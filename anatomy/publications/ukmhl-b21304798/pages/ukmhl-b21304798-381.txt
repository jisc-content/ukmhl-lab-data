345 Q 5 Thin ligamentous bands are extended between the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the fifth to the eleventh. ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. The ribs are joined to the spine by the articulations between their heads and the cavities formed for them in the two adjoining vertebrae, and in the interverte- bral substance ; and by the articulations between their tubercles and the transverse processes. The first, tenth, and eleventh ribs are each joined only to a single vertebra, and the two latter have no articula- tions with the transverse processes. The head of each rib is joined to the spine by an Anterior and an Interarticular Ligament, and by .Syno- vial Membrane. The Anterior Ligament consists of fibres attached to the front of the head of the rib, and thence extending over the articulation upwards and downwards in a radiated manner upon the sides of the vertebrae and upon the intervertebral substance. The joint belonging to the head of each rib is di- vided into an upper and a lower part by the interarti- cular ligament, which is attached on one side to the projecting ridge in the articular surface of the rib, and on the other to the cavity in the intervertebral sub- stance, in which the head is received. The upper and lower divisions of this joint are provided witli distinct synovial membranes,

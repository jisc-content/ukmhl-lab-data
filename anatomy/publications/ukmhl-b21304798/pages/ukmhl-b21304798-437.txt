401 filaments from the side of the medulla spinalis be- tween the anterior and posterior roots of the cervical nerves. There is considerable variety with respect to the point at which the filaments begin to arise. In some instances they commence as low down as thc origin of the seventh cervical nerve. The filaments unite into a single nerve which ascends through the foramen magnum, and continues its course within the skull obliquely upwards and outwards to the foramen jugulare, through which it passes with the two other divisions of the eighth pair. The ninth pair of nerves is named theHvpo-GLOs- SAL, or Likgual. Each of these nerves arises by numerous delicate filaments from the bottom of the groove between the corpus pyramidale and corpus olivare. The filaments unite into a single nerve, which passes out of the skull through the foramen condyloideum anterius. A tenth pair of cerebral nerves is sometimes de- scribed by the name of Suboccipital. These nerves are, however, more commonly described as forming the first pair of the cervical nerves. DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. The Brain receives its supply of blood from the two Internal Carotid and the two Vertebral Arteries.

180 side, and on the left, in front of the arch of the aorta. Its further course will be described with the dissection of the thorax. The branches which the par vagum gives off in the neck, are 1. Filaments of communication with the glosso- pharyngeal and other nerves at the basis of the skull. 2. A Pharyngeal branch, which descends ob- liquely inwards to the pharynx, where it separates into many filaments, forming the pharyngeal plexus, which is distributed principally to the constrictor muscles of the pharynx. 3. The Superior Laryngeal Nerve, which arises below the preceding, passes downwards and forwards, behind the internal carotid artery to the larynx, into which it enters either by penetrating the mucous membrane, which connects the os hyoides with the thyroid cartilage, or by passing through a hole in the ala of the thyroid cartilage itself. Its filaments are distributed to the muscles and to the mucous membrane lining the larynx and pharynx. They communicate with the filaments of the recur- rent nerve. The superior laryngeal nerve, before it enters the larynx, gives off a branch, sometimes denominated the external laryngeal nerve, which is distributed prin- cipally to the muscles on the outside of the larynx and pharynx. 4. Filaments, which arising from the par vagum at the lower part of the neck, proceed down-

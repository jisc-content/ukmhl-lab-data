100 ilio-lumbalis, glutzeal, ischiatic or pudendal arteries. In a few instances it has been seen to arise from the femoral artery, and to ascend from the thigh be- neath Poupartâ€™s ligament into the pelvis. When it arises by a common trunk with the epigastric, it then descends behind the os pubis to the obturator foramen. 8. Glut^;a, which is the largest branch of the internal iliac, arising from the back part of the trunk, turns outwards and backwards to pass out of the pelvis through the highest part of the great sacro- ischiatic notch, and above the pyriformis muscle. Its further distribution will be described with the dissec- tion of the buttock. 9. Ischiatic A, which is next in size to the glutaeal, passes out of the pelvis through the lower part of the great ischiatic notch and below the pyriformis muscle. Its further distribution will be described with the dis- section of the buttock. 10. Pudenda. The pudendal artery also passes out of the pelvis through the lower part of the great ischiatic notch, and then turns downwards beneath the posterior ischiatic ligament and enters the pelvis again through the lesser ischiatic notch. Within the pelvis, the pudendal artery proceeds almost horizontally across the lower part of the ob- turator internus muscle to the ramus ischii just above the tuberosity, and then ascends upon the inside of the ramus as high as the attachments of the transversus perinei and erector penis muscles, where it terminates

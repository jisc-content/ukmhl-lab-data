B 3 integuments are reflected from the lower part of the abdomen, the ring of the external oblique is not im- mediately brought into view, as it is concealed by the cellular tissue just mentioned, which descends from the sides of the opening down the front of the spermatic cord. j Or THE Inguinal Absorbent Glands.—Three or four absorbent glands are found imbedded in the cellular tissue upon the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and just above Poupart’s ligament. They are connected with the chain of glands which are placed at the upper part of the thigh upon the fascia lata. The superficial absorbents of the external organs of generation, terminate in part, in these glands above Poupart’s ligament. There arc other points connected with this stage of the dissection which yet remain to be mentioned. ‘ The Linea Alba is a white line extending from the ensiform cartilage down the middle of the abdomen to the os pubis, and is formed by the inter- lacement of the tendinous fasciculi belonging to the aponeuroses on each side. The linea alba is broadest at its upper part, and just below its middle, is the umbilicus, which in the foetus is an opening for the passage of the navel string, but in the adult it appears as a cicatrix, to which the skin is very firmly united. Previously to the removal.of the integuments, the umbilicus forms a depression deeper in proportion to the fatness of the subject. .. The Linea Semilunaris is another white line

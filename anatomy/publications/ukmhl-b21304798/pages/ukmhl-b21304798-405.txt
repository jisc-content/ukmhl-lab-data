369 Ihe head of the tibia. Externally, the cartilages are roiinected with the lateral ligaments, while their in- ternal thin edges are loose in the cavity of the joint. The anterior and posterior extremities of each carti lage are fixed to the head of the tibia, in front and behind its middle protuberance. In some subjects, the two cartilages are united in front by a shor transverse ligament extended across between their convex borders. The cartilage covering the condyles of the femur is thicker in the middle than in the circumference. The cartilage covering the head of the tibia is the reverse. The cartilage covering the posterior surface of the patella is thicker than that upon the tibia. AKTIGULATIONS BETWEEN THE TIBIA AND FIBULA. The tibia and fibula are united at their extremities by distinct articulations, and in the middle, by the interosseous ligament. The superior articulation of the tibia and fibula is formed by the contact of their flattened cartilaginous surfaces. These surfaces are covered by synovial membrane, and the articulation is strengthened by ligamentous bands which are extended obliquely from one bone to the other, both in front and behind. The tendon of the biceps assists in giving strength to this joint. The Interosseous Ligament is a thin expan- R 5

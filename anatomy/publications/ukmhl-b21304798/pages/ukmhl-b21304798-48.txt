12 stood to be formed by the aponeuroses of the two oblique and of the transversalis muscles, which se- parating in the manner described at the linea se- milunaris, thence extend in front, and behind the rectus, to the linea alba, where they are intermixed with the aponeuroses of the muscles from the oppo- site side. The rectus is thus inclosed within a sheath formed in front, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique, by the whole anterior layer, and a part of the posterior layer of the aponeurosis belonging to the internal oblique, and by the in- ferior portion of the aponeurosis belonging to the transversalis. It is formed behind by the remaining part of the posterior layer of the aponeurosis belong- ing to the internal oblique, and by the superior por- tion of the aponeurosis belonging to the transversalis. Consequently it happens, that behind, the sheath of the rectus is incomplete, since in its upper three-fourths only, it is covered on both sides by the aponeuroses, and, in its lower fourth, the aponeuroses passing en- tirely in front of the muscle, would here leave it in contact with the peritoneum but for the intervention of the common cellular tissue. If the rectus is cut across in its middle, and its lower half turned down- wards, the deficiency in the posterior part of its sheath will be evident. It must be remarked that the posterior part of the sheath does not terminate- abruptly by a well defined edge, but that the ten- dinous fibres of which it is formed, become gra- y

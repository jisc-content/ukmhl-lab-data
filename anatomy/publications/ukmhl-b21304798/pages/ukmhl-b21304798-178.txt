142 little below the knee joint, in a thin and flat tendon, which is continued downwards between the gastro- cnemius and soleus, and then on the inside of the tendo Achillis, to be attached with it to the back part of the os calcis. This muscle is frequently wanting. The Soleus has tw'o distinct origins, the one from the posterior surface of the head of tlie fibula, and from the external angle of the bone, along its upper two-thirds, behind the peroneus longus; the other from the oblique ridge in the posterior surface of the tibia just below' the popliteus, and from the inner edge of the bone, along the middle third of its extent. From these origins, the fibres proceed downwards, forminn; a broad and thick muscle, which becoming tendinous near the lower part of the leg, unites with the tendon of the gastrocnemius to form the tendo Achillis. Reaching the os calcis, the tendo Achillis slides over a smooth suri'ace in its upper and back part, which is covered by cartilage, and lined by synovial membrane, and terminates in a rough sur- face on the low'er and back part of the bone. The posterior surface of the soleus, in contact with the gastrocnemius, is formed in great part by an expansion of tendinous fibres. The soleus being reflected, a small muscle is seen just below the knee, extended obliquely across the back of the log, close upon the tibia. This is The Popliteus. It arises from an excavation in the outer side of the external condyle, by a thick fl at

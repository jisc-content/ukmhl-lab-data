81 between the crura penis to the commencement of the corpus spongiosum, or bulb. Between the upper side of the canal and the under part of the sym- physis pubis, there is an interspace of about three quarters of an inch, and below, the canal is sepa- rated j from the rectum by a considerable quantity of loose cellular tissue. The sides of this portion of the urethra are formed by a dense fleshy substance placed closely round the internal membrane. This substance is generally believed to consist of muscular fibres, arranged for the most part in a circular di- rection. A thin aponeurotic expansion is stretched across between the rami of the pubes, and is consequently of a triangular form, with its broadest part turned downwards. Itis called the Triangular Ligament of the urethra, or the interosseous ligament of the pubes. The urethra perforates the centre of this expansion, and the bulb is firmly united with it in front. Two small fasciculi of muscular fibres descend from the arch of the pubes, on each side of the urethra, to its lower part, where they meet. They have been denominated the Compressores, or Le- vatores Urethra;. The urethra having reached the bulb, becomes surrounded by the substance of the corpus spongio- sum, and is continued along the groove beneath the middle of the united corpora cavernosa to their an- terior extremities. It then passes through the glans E 5

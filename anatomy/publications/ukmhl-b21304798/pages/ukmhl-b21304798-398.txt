562 ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN THE METACAR- PUS AND PHALANGES OF THE THUMB AND FINGERS, AND OF THE PHALANGES BETWEEN THEMSELVES. The articulations between the metacarpal bones and the first digital phalanx, are each of them pro- vided with a distinct synovial membrane, and with lateral ligaments. The Lateral Ligaments arise from the sides of the metacarpal bones, near their extremities, and proceeding obliquely forwards, are fixed to the sides of the corresponding bones of the first phalanx. Each of these joints is further strengthened by the sheath of the flexor tendon in front, and by the ex- tensor tendon behind, both of which arc adherent to the capsule. At their sides, the joints are strength- ened by the tendons of the interossei passing over them. The articulations between the phalanges of the thumb and fingers arc all of them in every re- spect alike- Each joint is furnished with a distinct capsule, and wiih lateral ligaments, resembling those of the articulations last described. Each joint is further strengthened by the sheath of the flexor tendon in front, and by the extensor tendon behind.

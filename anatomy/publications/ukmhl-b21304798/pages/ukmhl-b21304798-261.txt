The integuments of the head are characterized by the thickness and density of their texture, and by the closeness of their union with the parts beneath. Beneath the integuments there are found two broad and thin strata of fleshy fibres, extended upon the anterior part of the frontal bone, and two similar strata of fibres extended upon the back part of the occipital bone ; and between these an aponeurosis is expanded over the whole of the superior part of the head. The two strata of fleshy fibres, in front and behind, form together the occipito-frontales muscles, and the aponeurosis extended between them, is regarded as their common tendon. The Occipito-Frontalis arises behind from the upper transverse ridge of the occipital bone, whence

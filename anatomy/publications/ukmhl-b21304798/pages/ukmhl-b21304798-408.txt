ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN THE BONES Of THE TARSUS AND METATARSUS. The articulation between the inferior surface of the astragalus and the upper part of the os calcis has a. distinct synovial membrane, and is secured by an interosseous and a posterior ligament. The Interosseous Ligament is formed of nu- merous strong fii.ues passing from the groove between- the articular surfaces of the astragalus to the corre- sponding groove between the articular surfaces in the upper part of the os calcis. The Posterior Ligament is formed of parallel fibres passing downw aids from the back part of the astragalus to the adjacent part of the os calcis. Ihe articulation between the astragalus, os navicu- lare and os calcis has a synovial membrane reflected upon the cartilaginous surfaces of the three bones, and is secured by the following ligaments. A Superior or Dorsal Ligament, which passes across from the upper part of the astragalus to the upper rough surface of the os naviculare. An Inierior or Plantar Ligament, which passes from the under and front part of the os calcis to the hollow in the under surface of the os nariculard. This ligament very stri ng. It not only binds the os calcis to the os naviculare, but also supports the head of the astragahus which rests uj on it above. Ki\ External Ligament, which passes from the

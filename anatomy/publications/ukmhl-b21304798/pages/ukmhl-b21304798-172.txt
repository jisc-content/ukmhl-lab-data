is theiiTcflcctod forwards obliquely over the outer side of the os calcis, is continued through a groove in the os cuboides, and passes across the sole of the foot to terminate in the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone belonging to the great toe. Its insertion cannot be seen until the muscles of the foot arc dissected. The Peroneus Brevis arises from the outer side of the lower half of the fibula and from the aponeu- rotic expansions separating it behind from the llexor longus digitorum, and in front, from the peroneus terlius. It terminates obliquely in a tendon which passes through the same groove in the lower end of the fibula, as the peroneus longus. The tendon of the peroneus brevis is then reflected almost hori- zontally forwards to be attached to the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. The tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis, as they pass through the groove in the fibula, are con- fined in their situations by complite sheaths, which arc of a fibrous structure, and are lined by synovial membrane. There is one muscle placed upon the upper sur- face of the foot, beneaih the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis. This is The Extensor Brevis? Digitorum Pedis. It arises from the upper part of the os calcis, and from the ligament connecting this bone to the astra- galus, and torms a thin and sijuare muscle, which proceeds oblicjuely forwards upon the foot, and sepa-

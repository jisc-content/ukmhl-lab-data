The bronchial arteries vary much in their origin. They frequently arise by a common trunk with one of the intercostal arteries, or with the oesophageal ar- teries, next to be described. It has been shewn by injections, that the bronchial arteries communicate with the branches of the pul- monary artery in the lungs. 2. The (Esophageal Arteries, which consist of several small branches distributed upon the coats of the oesophagus. The lowermost of them accom- pany the oesophagus to the stomach, and communi- cate with the branches of the coronaria ventriculi which is derived from the coeliac artery. The oesophageal arteries may arise by common trunks, either with the bronchial, or with the inter- costal arteries. 3. The Intercostal Arteries, varying in num- ber from seven to ten. They arise from the lateral and back part of the aorta, and proceed transversely out- wards to the lower margins of the ribs, the arteries of the right side passing over the bodies of the vertebire, and the upper arteries ascending obliquely to the ribs. Each intercostal artery proceeds forwards along the â– groove in the lower margin of the rib, with the in- tercostal vein and nerve towards the sternum, where the arteries terminate in communications with the in- ternal mammary arteries, and with the thoracic branches of the subclavian artery. The uppermost intercostal communicates with the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian, and the two or three lower-

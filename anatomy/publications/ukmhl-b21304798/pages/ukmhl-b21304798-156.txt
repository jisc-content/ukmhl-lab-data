120 SECT. II. OF THE BUTTOCK AND BACK PART OF THE THIGH. Upou the reflection of tlie integuments from the buttock and back part of tlie thigh, the Gluteeus Max- imus muscle is seen covering the lower and back part of the os innominatum. From the front edge of the glutaeus maximus, a portion of fascia is extended over a part of the Glutreus Medius muscle, to the posterior margin of the crista ilii, where it is attached. The GlutjEUs Maximus arises from the posterior margin of the crista ilii in about one half of its length, from the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and from the posterior sacro-ischiatic ligament, over which the muscle hangs in a loose fold. Its fibres, which are very large, proceed from these origins ob- liquely downwaids, forming a broad and thick muscle, which ends in a flat tendon. The tendon slides over the back part of the trochanter major, and terminates partly in a broad and firm connexion with the fascia lata, and partly by insertion into a rough surface of

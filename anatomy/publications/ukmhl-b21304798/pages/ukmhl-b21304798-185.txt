149 H 3 by dividing into five distinct slips, which again divide into smaller slips. These slips penetrate inwards, and become united to the digital ends of the metatarsal bones. Through the spaces left between these slips, the tendons, vessels, and nerves pass forwards to the toes. The plantar fascia is firmly attached on its inner surface to the muscles beneath. Two processes of the fascia are extended inwards between the muscles, so as to form partitions, separating them into dis- tinct masses. The plantar fascia is to be removed, and the muscles beneath it are to be cautiously dissected, in order that the vessels and nerves passing between them may be preserved. There are three distinct masses of muscles in the foot, one on each side, and the third in the middle. The mass on the inner side consists of The Abductor Pollicis Pedis extending from the os calcis to the inside of the great toe. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis Pedis, lying upon the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and partly united with the abductor. â€¢ The Adductor Pollicis Pedis, situated on the outer side of the Flexor Brevis, and connected with it by cellular tissue. ' The mass on the outer side consists of The Abductor Minimi Digiti Pedis, extend- ing from the os calcis to the outside of the little toe. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti Pedis,

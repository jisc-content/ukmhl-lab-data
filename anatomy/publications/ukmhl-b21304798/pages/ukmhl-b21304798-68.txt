32 of the duodenum and pancreas, cannot at present be brought into view. Below the neck of the gall-bladder, and just under the edge of the lesser omentum containing the hepatic vessels and biliary ducts, an opening is found large enough to admit one or two fingers. This is the Foramen of Winslow or Foramen Epiplo- icuM. If air is blown into this opening, it will pass between that part of the peritoneum covering the under surface of the stomach and the superior layer of the mesocolon, and will then continue its course into the centre of the four layers composing the great omentum* The omentum m^y by this means be inflated into the form of a bag, provided the cellular adhesions are not sufficiently strong to resist the impulse of the air blown against them. The foramen of Winslow is not infrequently obliterated by adhesions between its opposite sides. Small pendulous processes, which consist of peri- toneum containing a deposit of fat, are found irre- gularly attached to various parts of the large in- testine. These are the AppENDrcES Epiploic^e. The student should now dissect the vessels contained in the edge of the lesser omentum, denominated capsula glissoni ; for which purpose, the liver must be lifted upwards, and its front edge fastened to. the cartilagi- nous margins of the ribs. By dissecting carefully through the layers of the lesser omentum, there will be brought into view the Biliary Duct, or Ductus Communis Cholcdochus,

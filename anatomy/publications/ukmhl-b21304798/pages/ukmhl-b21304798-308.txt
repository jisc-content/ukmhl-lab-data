272 from the mouth, we see it bounded above, by the half arches of the soft palate, and by the uvula; below, by the basis of the tongue, and at ^the sides, by the membranous folds of the palate, between which the tonsils are apparent. The terminatioirs of the Salivaiy Ducts in the mouth are next to be examined. The Parotid Duct penetrates the mucous mem- brane of the cheek, opposite to the first grinding tooth, by a small opening, around wluch there is a loose fold of the mucous membrane. The Submaxillary Duct terminates in the mouth by a very small opening, close to the side of the fraenum of the tongue. The principal Sublingual Duct joins the sub- maxillary duct just before its termination. Other smaller ducts frequently arise from the sublingual gland, and open into the moutli behind the termi- nation of the submaxillary duct. The Tongue is divided into the basis which is its thickest and broadest part, and into the apex which is thinner and of a rounded form. The tongue is fixed throughout the greater extent of its under sur- face by its connexions with the several muscles, which arising from the styloid process, os hyoides and lower jaw, are thence continued into the sub- stance of the organ. Its base is connected w'ith the epiglottis, which will be presently described, by three folds formed by the mucous membrane in its reflections between these parts.

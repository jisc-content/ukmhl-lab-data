23 The other opening of the stomach is formed by the termination of its small extremity, and is denominated the luierior or pyloric orifice, which is placed about two inches lower than the oesophageal. The great extremity of the stomach is lodged in the left hypo- chondrium, whence the organ extends across the epigastric region, rather obliquely downwards, into the right hypochondrium. Near its lower end, the stomach begins to bend backwards and upwards, and approaches to the neck of the gall bladder, where it terminates by a circular contraction denominated the Pylorus. When the stomach is empty and contracted, it is lodged almost entirely beneath the cartilages of the ribs ; but when distended, it will descend below the base of the chest behind the muscles of the abdomen. The small arch of the stomach is connected to the liver by a thin and transparent membrane, which is the Lesser Omentum, or the Omentum Hepatico Gastricum. It consists of two layers of peritoneum closely united, and proceeding from the under surface of the liver across to the small arch of the stomach. A few absorbent glands are found irregularly scattered between these layers of the lesser omentum. The vessels passing to and from the liver are lodged between the layers in front, and near their right edge. This edge of the lesser omentum, containing the hepatic vessels and biliary ducts, is called Capsula Glissoni.

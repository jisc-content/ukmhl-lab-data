iQ relation to the round ligament as it docs to the spermatic cord in the male. For a more detailed account of these parts, the student is referred to j\Ir. Lawrenceâ€™s Treatise on Ruptures. The abdominal muscles are now to be dissected from the peritoneum, which lines their posterior sur- face. It will be observed that on each side, and to- wards the back part of the abdomen, the muscles and peritoneum arc connected by loose cellular tissue, especially in the latter situation, while, in front, the posterior part of the sheaths of the recti is so firmly united with the peritoneum, that consi* derable care is required to effect their complete sepa- ration. Between the peritoneum and the abdominal muscles in the frontr of the abdomen, there are found three fibrous and solid cords, which are sometimes but in- distinctly seen in the adult. Two of these cords arising from the cavity of the pelvis, one on each side, ascend obliquely between the peritoneum and muscles, and approach gradually to each other until they meet at the umbilicus. The third cord arising from the superior part of the bladder pro- ceeds directly upwards between the two lateral cords to the umbilicus, where they all terminate by being intermixed with the tendinous fibres of the linea alba. The two lateral cords arc the remains of the umbilical arteries, and the middle cord is deno- minated the urachus. %

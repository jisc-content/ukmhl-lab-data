41 The Inferior Mesenteric Vein begins in the pelvis by branches which returning the blood from the rectum, accompany the ramifications of the internal haemorrhoidal artery. It ascends from the back part of the pelvis into the abdomen, and proceeds strait upwards along the left side of the spine, receiving branches from the descending colon and sigmoid flexure. The inferior mesenteric vein then continues its course under the mesocolon, and behind the pancreas, where it terminates by opening into the splenic vein. The stomach must now be removed, by separating it from the surrounding connexions at its cardiac ex- tremity, and by dividing its small end immediately above the pylorus, in ,order that the duodenum may be left entire. The spleen, coecum, and colon, jejunum and ilium, are also to be taken away to facilitate the examination of the deeper-seated viscera. The Duodenum is already known to be the first portion of the small intestines. It is so named on account of its length, which is about equal to the breadth of twelve fingers. In order to see the course of the duodenum advantageously, the intestine must be moderately distended with air, and retained so by a ligature tied round each of its extremities. The duodenum proceeds from the pylorus a little â€¢ upwards and backwards and to the right towards the neck of the gall-bladder. It then proceeds down- wards almost in a strait direction in front of the right kidney. At the lower part of the kidney, and oppo-

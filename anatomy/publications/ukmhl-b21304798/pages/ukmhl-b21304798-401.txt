365 :icetabulum, is filled by a mass of soft adipose and cellular tissue. The cartilage covering the head of the femur is thicker in the middle than towards its circumference, while the cartilage covering the acetabulum is thinner in its middle than towards its edges. It may be observed, that the acetabulum, notwithstanding its apparent depth, is still insufficient to include the entire cartilaginous surface of the head of the fe- mur. In every position of the bones, a small portion of the head is always beyond the brim of its cavity, AKTICULATION OF THE FEMUR WITH THE TIBIA AND PATELLA. In this articulation we meet with several strong li- gaments securing the bones in their relative situations; a synovial membrane, and two semilunar interarticu- lar cartilages placed between the condyles of the femur and the articular surfaces of the tibia. Three lateral ligaments are usually described, one internal and two e.xternal. 3'he Internal Lateral Ligament is broad and flattened. It is attached above to the internal condyle of the femur, whence it descends gradually increasing in breadth, and is fi.xed below to the edge of the internal semilunar cartilage, and to the head and inside of the tibia. The External Lateral Ligaments are dis- H 3

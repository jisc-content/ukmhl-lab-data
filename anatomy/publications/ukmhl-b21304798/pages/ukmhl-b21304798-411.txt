375 articulations arc covered by reflections of the synovial membranes from the articulations between the tarsus and metatarsus. They are secured by dorsal and plantar ligaments passing transversely from one bone to the other, and by interosseous ligaments, con- sisting of numerous short fibres passing between their contiguous sides. The metatarsal bones are connected at their digital ends by a transverse ligament situated beneath them, and extending across from one bone to the other. The articulations between the metatarsal bones and the first phalanx of the toes are provided with syno- vial membranes, and with lateral ligaments re- sembling those of the articulations between the meta- carpus and fingers. The sesamoid bones are united by ligaments to the first bone of the great toe. The articulations between the phalanges of the toes so nearly resemble those of the fingers, that they do not require any particular description.

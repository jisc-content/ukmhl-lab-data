18t wards into the chest, and join the cardiac plexus, which is destined for the supply of tlie heart. The Recurrent Nerve is found in the lower part of the neck, between the trachea and oesophagus. It arises from the par vagum, just after its entrance into the chest, and thence turns upwards into the neck. The complete description of this nerve will be given with the dissection of the thorax. The Gre.4t Sy.apathetic or Intercostal Nerve begins in the upper part of the neck, at the Superior Cervical Gangliox, which is deeply situated immediately under the basis of the skull, be- hind the internal carotid artery, and on the outside of the par vagum and hypo-glossal nerves. The extent of the ganglion varies much in different subjects. It may terminate at the third cervical vertebra, or it may reach as low as the fifth. From the upper end of the ganglion, two filaments generally arise, which ascending into the canalis carotideus, are continued through it, and join the fifth and sixth pairs of the cerebral nerves. From the lower end of the superior cervical gang- lion, a single filament arises, uhich is generally re- garded as the continued '.runk of the Sympathetic. It descends along the neck behind the carotid artery, close upon the rectus anticus major and longus colli muscles to the Middle Cervical Ganglion, which is situated at about the fifth vertebra. The middle ganglion is frequently so small that it rather

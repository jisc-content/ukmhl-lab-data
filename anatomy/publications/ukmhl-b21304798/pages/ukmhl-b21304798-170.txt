134 ment. Its fibres proceed downwards and inwards, and are firmly connected with the aponeurotic expansion, separating them from the extensor longus djgiiorum. At the beginning of the lower third of the leg, they terminate in a tliick and flat tendon, which passes forwards from the lower end of the tibia over the ancle joint, and beneath the annular ligament, and continues its course to the inside of the fool, where it is attached to the internal side of the os cuneitbrme internum, and to the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Between the tendon and the cuneiform bone, there is a small bursa mucosa. The Extensor Longus Digitorum Pedis arises from the outer side of the head of the tibia, from the adjacent part of the head of the fibula, from the interosseous ligament, and from the front surface ot the fibula nearly ail the way down the leg. It proceeds obliquely downwards and inwards, and is connected in its course with the aponeurotic ex- pansions, separating it on one side from the peronei muscles, and on ihe other, from the tibialis anlicus. In the lower part of tiie leg it terminates in four tendons, which pass benea.'h the annular ligament, and are continued forwards upon the foot to the four lesser toes, where they are expanded over the upper suruices of tneir phalanges. he lixTENsoR Proprius Poelicis Pf.dis arises from the inner side of the fibula, ami from the in- terosseous ligament. Its origin begins just below the lieatl of the bone, and extends almost to its lower

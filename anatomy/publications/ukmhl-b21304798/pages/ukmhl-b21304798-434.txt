398 Opticus. The two nen^es are united immediately above the smooth surface of the sphenoid bone between ,the anterior clinoid processes, and in front of the sella turcica. Each nerve then proceeds obliquely outwards and forwards to the foramen opticum, through which it passes into the orbit. The third pair of nerves is named the Motores OcuLORUM. It arises from the front and inner edge of the crus cerebri, and proceeds from its origin ob- liquely outwards and forwards to the front part of the tentorium, where it enters the cavernous sinus. The nerve then continues its course forwards alone; the eKternal side of the sinus, and passes through the fissura lacera into the orbit. The fourth pair of nerves is named the Troch- LEARES, or Pathetici, and is the smallest of the cerebral nerves. It arises by two or three filaments from the valve of the brain, whence it turns round the crus cerebri, between the cerebrum and the cere- bellum, and proceeds forwards along the edge of the tentorium to the posterior clinoid process. Here it enters the cavernous sinus, and continues its course forwards along the external side of the sinus to the fissura lacera, through which it passes into the orbit. The fifth pair of nerves is named the Trigemini, and is the largest of the cerebral nerves. It arises from the lower and front part of the crus cerebelii, just at its union with the tuber annulare. From its origin, it proceeds obliquely outwards and forwards

71 ischium, and thence extends across to the side of the os coccygis and sacrum, to which it is attached. The vessels and nerves met with in the dissection of the perineum are few in number, and of a small size. The Arteria Perinea Supeuficialis is a small branch of the pudendal artery which ad- vances forwards from the triangular space between the erector and accelerator muscles, and then passing upwards over the transversus, terminates above in ramifications distributed to the skin of the scrotum and penis. In this course, the perinea superficialis sends off The Transversa Perinei, distributed to the transversus muscle. A branch of the pudendal nerve is also seen ex- tending its ramifications up the perineum in com- pany with the perineal artery. OFTHE SCROTUM, TESTICLE, AND SPERMATIC CORD. The skin of the scrotum is of a brownish colour, and so thin in its texture, that the veins ramifying in the subjacent cellular tissue are distinctly visible through it. Beneath the skin of the scrotum is a very large quantity of cellulai' tissue in which fat is never de- posited. This cellular tissue is very loose on each side, but in the middle, is more condensed so as to form the Septum Scroti which divides the bag into

3G4 I ho depth of the acetabulum is considerably in- creased by a band of fibrous substance, attached to the whole circumference of its bony margin, and ex- tending across the notch on its inner side. This band is strengthened above by the addition of fibres from one of the tendons of the rectus muscle. The notch on^-the inner side of the acetabulum is occupied partly by the fibrous band just mentioned, and partly by two additional ligamentous bands, de- nominated the Transveiise Ligaments of the Acetabulum, which arc extended between the op- posite edges of the notch, and decussate each other in their course. These bands arc all united, and they together completely fill the notch, exce})t at its lower part, where a vacancy is left for the passage of vessels into the joint. The Interarticular Ligament of the hip, although it is denominated the Ligamentum Teres, is of a flattened and triangular form. It is fixed, at its narrow end, to the depression in the head of the femur, and at its broad end, it divides into two portions, which are attached to the corners of the notch in the acetabulum; and to the transverse ligament extending across it. The synovial membrane is reflected, as already stated, around the ligamentum teres. Hence the ligament is placed on the outer side of the mem- brane, although it appears within the cavity of the joint. The depression which exists at the bottom of the

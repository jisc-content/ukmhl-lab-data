301 S surface is united by loose cellular tissue, to the cap- sule of the shoulder-joint. In reflecting the muscle^ we meet with the branches of the circumflex vessels and nerve distributed to its under surface. The deltoid muscle must now be reflected from its origins, in order to bring the other muscles of the scapula more completely into view. A thick aponeurosis covers the muscles on the dorsum of the scapula, both above and below the spine. In removing this aponeurosis, it will be found adherent, in some situations, to the muscles beneath, so as to leave their surfaces rough and irregular. Above the spine of the scapula we meet with The SuPRA-SpiNy\Tus muscle, which occupies the whole fossa in the bone between the spine and superior costa. Its fibres have their origin from great part of the surface of the bone which the muscle covers, and thence converging towards the neck of the scapula, they terminate in a thick tendon which passes beneath the ligament extended between the acromion and coracoid process, and then continues its course beneath the deltoid, and over the shoulder-joint, to the capsule of which it is firmly united, and is at length attached to the front part of the great tuberosity of the os humeri. Below the spine of the scapula we meet with The Infra-Spinatus muscle, which occupies the whole extent of the scapula between the spine, basis, and inferior costa. Its fibres arise from nearly all the surface of the bone which the muscle covers,

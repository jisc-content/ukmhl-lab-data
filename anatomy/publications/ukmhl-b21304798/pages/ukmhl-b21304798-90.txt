54 Jiaphragm, where it is attached to the ribs, the rami- fications of the phrenic arteries communicate with the thoracic branches of the subclavian artery. ' The phrenic arteries are subject to many varieties. They may arise by a common trunk from the aorta or from the coeliac artery. The two branches may have separate origins, one from the aorta, and the other from the coeliac artery. Occasionally there are three or four phrenic arteries. 2. The CoiLiAC Artery, which is large, arises at a ^ort distance below the phrenics, from the front of the aorta, while it is still lodged be- tween the crura of the diaphragm. The distri- bution of the coeliac artery has been already described, page 33. 3. The Superior Mesenteric Artery, which is the largest branch of the aorta, arises from its front part at the distance only of a few lines below the coeliac. Sometimes the coeliac and supe- rior mesenteric arteries arise so nearly together, that they appear to have a common trunk. 'Hie distribu- tion of the superior mesenteric artery has been al- ready described, page 38. 4. The Capsular Arteries, which are small branches of variable number, arise from each side of the aorta near the superior mesenteric. They proceed transversely to the renal capsules, and distribute many ramifications to the surrounding parts. 5. The Renal Arteries, which are usually

394 It is already known, that the anterior crura of the fornix terminate in these bodies. In the description of the third ventricle, it was stated that its lower boundary is formed by certain parts at the basis of the brain. These parts are, the square portion of grey substance just described, the coqjora albicantia, and a small portion of white sub- stance which is found behind the corpora albicantia and between the crura cerebri. Of the Cerebellum. The cerebellum is rather of an elliptical form, its longest diameter extending transversely from one side to the other. It is divided into two lateral lobes or hemispheres, which are separated by the falx cerebelli. Its upper surface is obliquely flattened on each side, and in the centre, presents an eminence which is named the Superior Vermiform Process. Its lower surface presents convexities on each side adapted to the fosste of the occiput, and a deep fissure in the middle. At the bottom of this fissure there is a convex ridge which is named the Inferior Vermiform Process. The external surface of the cerebellum is divided into flattened strata, between which there are fissures cor- responding to the sulci between the convolutions of the cerebrum. The pia mater extends into these fissures, and the arachnoid membrane simply passes over them. If a vertical section be made through either lobe of the cerebellum, a thick mass of white substance is seen in the centre, which divides into the several strata in an arborescent manner, producing

383 gently separated, when a broad portion of white substance will be brought into view, extending across from the bottom of the internal flattened side of one he- misphere to the opposite. This is the Corpus Cal- losum. In relation to the sides of the brain, it is placed in its centre, but approaches nearer to its front than to its back part. The upper surface of the corpus callosum is slightly convex, and is a little overlapped by the hemisphere on each side. Two longitudinal ridges, nearly parallel, are extended along the middle of its upper surface, and between these, a superficial furrow is left, named the Raphe'. Other ridges, usually less distinct, run transversely across on either side of the raphe. These are named LinE/E Transversal. Two arteries of considerable size ramify upon the corpus callosum. These are the Anterior Arteries of the cerebrum, which will be seen at the basis, arising from the Internal Ca- rotids. When both hemispheres are removed down to the level of the corpus callosum, we have the view of the brain which is named the Centk,um Ovale. The large surface of white substance now exposed, forms an irregular oval, surrounded by the grey substance at its edges. An incision is to be carefully made through the corpus callosum, on either side of the raphe, until an opening is made into the cavities named the La- teral V'entrxcles. The upper part, or roof, of each venticle is formed by the under surface of the

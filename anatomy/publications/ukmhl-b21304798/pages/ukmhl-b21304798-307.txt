271 N 4 latine bones; and its lower bolder, which is loose in the pharynx, is divided into two parts, presenting the appearance of half arches, by the uvula, which hangs from its middle. The length of the uvula varies in different individuals. Its form is co- nical, with the broadest end upwards. The lateral parts of the soft palate are formed by hvo membranous folds already described, which descend to the root of the tongue, and to the sides of the pharynx. At their commencement in the palate these folds are united, but as they descend to their termination, they gradually separate, so as to leave between them a triangular space on each side, in which the tonsil is contained. The Tonsils, or Amyodal-e, are two glandular bodies, one of them being placed on each side of the palate, in the situation just mentioned. Their figure is generally compared with that of an almond, from which their name of amygdalae is derived. They are of a grey colour, and appear to be divided, more or less distinctly, into lobes. On that surface of the tonsil, which projects between the palatine folds, there are seen numerous small orifices, leading to cells in the interior of the gland, and from which the mucous secretion may be discharged by pres- sure. The boundaries of the opening of communication between the mouth and pharynx, denominated the Isthmus Faucium, are formed by the parts we have just described. In the view of this opening

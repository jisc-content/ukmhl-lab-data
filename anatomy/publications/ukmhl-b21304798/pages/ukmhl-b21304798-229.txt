193 (а) The Supra-Scapulae, an artery of variable size, sometimes denominated Transversalis Sca- I puLARis, or, Transversalis Humeri. From its origin, it bends obliquely downwards, and then runs across the neck, immediately behind the cla- vicle to the superior costa of the scapula. It next pro- ceeds downwards, either under or above the ligament which extends across the supra-scapular notch, and then continues its course beneath the acromion, where it ends by inosculating with a large branch of the infra-scapular artery, which is derived from the ax- illary trunk. Many other communications also take place upon the scapula, between the branches of the supra-scapular and infra-scapular arteries. (б) The Transversalis Colli, which runs transversely across the neck, and passing beneath the trapezius, ends in branches to the surrounding mus- cles which communicate above with the branches of the occipital artery. (c) The Ramus THYRoiDEffi Ascendens, which ascends in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and distributes its branches to the deep- seated muscles of the neck. Some of these enter the vertebral canal and terminate upon the membranes of the medulla spinalis, where they communicate with the branches of the vertebral artery. The Ramus Thyroideae Ascendens ends above in com- munications with the occipital artery. The transversalis colli and supra-scapular arteries K

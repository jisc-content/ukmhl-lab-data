433 wards along the groove to the apex of the heart. The other, denominated the Left, or Posterior Coronary Artery,passes between the pulmonary artery and left auricle to the groove between the ven- tricles on the convex surface of the heart, and de- scends along this groove to the apex. It sends off a branch which passes round the heart in the. groove between the left auricle and ventricle to the flattened surface. The Veins of the heart for the most part accom- pany the arteries. Their terminations in the Right Auricle have been mentioned. It has been occasionally found that injection forced into the coronary vessels has escaped through nu- merous minute orifices into the cavities of the heart. These orifices, which are not easily discovered, are the Foramina ThEbesii. The Nerves of the Heart are described in the dissection of the thorax. V

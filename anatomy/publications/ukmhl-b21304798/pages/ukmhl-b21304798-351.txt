339 The Internal Lateral Ligament arises from, the inner edge of the glenoid cavity, close to the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and descending obliquely forwards, is inserted into the inside of the lower jaw, at about mid-distance between the angle and the condyle. The Synovial Membrane consists of two dis- tinct sacs, one covers the cartilaginous surface of the eminentia articularis and glenoid cavity, and is con- tinued downwards upon the upper surface of the interarticular cartilage, the other covers the under surface of the interarticular cartilage, and is continued downwards upon the condyle. The joint is thus formed of two distinct cavities, having no communi- cation with each other. The Interarticular Cartilage is of an oval form, and thicker in its circumference than towards the centre. Its upper surface is adapted to the emi- nentia articularis and glenoid cavity, and its lower surface to the condyle. Externally, some of the fibres of the pterygoideus externus muscle are inserted into its front part, and the external lateral ligament adheres to it. In some instances, there is a hole in the centre of the cartilage. When the cavity of the joint is opened, the student must notice the extent and direction of the upper articular surface, which is formed by the eminentia articularis, and by that part of the glenoid cavity which is in front of the fissura Glascri.

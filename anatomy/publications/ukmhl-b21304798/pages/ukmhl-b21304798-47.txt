11 sheath, and becoming gradually broader as it pro- ceeds upwards to the base of the chest, where it di- vides into three portions, which are inserted into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs, and into the ensiform cartilage. The lineae transversa: have been already described as consisting of tendi- nous intersections, extending across the rectus. Their number varies in different subjects from three to five, and the majority of them are generally found above the umbilicus. They sometimes occupy only half the thickness of the muscle, and sometimes they ex- tend completely through it. Some of them generally run across its whole breadth, while others reach only to its middle. It is further to be remarked, that in the situation of the, lineae transversas, the sheath is much more firmly adherent to the muscle than else- where. In front of the rectus, at its lower part, and lodged within its sheath, there is a small triangular muscle, denominated The Pyramidalis, which arising broad from the upper part of the os pubis, close to its symphysis, ascends, gradually contracting its breadth, and, after a course of about an inch and a half, ends in a thin tendon, which terminates in the linea alba. Sometimes the pyramidalis is found on one side only, and, occasionally, the muscle is wanting on both sides. The Sheath of the Rectus is already under* B 6 .

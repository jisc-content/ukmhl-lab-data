341 Q 2 When the dura mater is removed from the basilar process of the occipital bone, and from the vertebral canal, a broad ligamentous expansion is seen pro- ceeding from the occipital bone downwards upon the bodies of the vertebrae. Upon the removal of this expansion, other ligamentous fibres are brought into view, which extend from the edge of the foramen magnum downwards, and terminate below by an insertion, partly into the transverse ligament of the odontoid process, and partly into the body of the second vertebra. These fibres form the Apparatus Colli Ligamentosus. Beneath the preceding ligamentous fibres, we ex- pose The two Odontoid Ligaments, which are thick and of a rounded form. They arise from the point and sides of the odontoid process, and proceeding upwards in a diverging manner, are attached to the edge of the foramen magnum close to the front of the condyles. A perpendicular ligamenb extends from the point of the odontoid process to the edge of the foramen magnum. This, however, is not very distinct. Its fibres appear to be more of a cellular than liga- mentous texture. The ligaments connecting the atlas with the den- tata, are A Transverse Ligament, which is extended across the back part of the odontoid process, and is attached at each extremity to a tubercle on the insid*

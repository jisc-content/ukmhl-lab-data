67 cellular tissue containing no fat. At the front ex- tremity of the penis, the skin forms a loose fold, de- nominated the PREPUCE, which is generally o;f suf- ficient length to cover the glans in its relaxed state. By drawing the prepuce backwards, we observe its inner layer to be continuous round the basis of the glans with the cuticular covering of the latter. The inner layer of the prepuce is further attached to the under part of the glans by a triangular fold of the skin, denominated the frcenum preputii. It is necessary that the subject should now be fixed in the same position as for the lateral operation of lithotomy, and the 'pelvis so raised as to expose the perineum to the light. Previously to the removal of the integuments, the student will notice the line, or, raphe, running down the middle of the perineum, and the projection of the tuber ischii on each side. He will thus be enabled to form a more correct notiop concerning the relative position of the several parts to be dissected. Beneath the integuments a considerable quantity of soft fat is brought into view, which extends deeply inwards under the arch of the pubes. This fat must be carefully removed, and in removing it, ten- dinous fibres will be remarked, which, however, are too irregular in their form and direction to allow of their being exhibited as a continuous aponeurotic ex- pansion. The muscles first brought into view are :â€” The Erectores Penis, covering the crura penis.

380 and partly on the outside of it. Hence they are dis- tinauishcd into the Internte and Externte, The Cllandula? Intornae have been already described. The Glandulse Externse are arranged in clusters along the upper and inner margin of each hemisphere of the cerebrum. "1 hey are enveloped in the pia mater, and when they exist in considerable number, they elevate the dura mater into little protuberances which produce corresponding excavations in the internal table of the skull on each side of the sagittal suture. The smooth surface of the brain exposed by the reflection of the dura mater, is forined by its second ' membrane, named the Arachnoid. The Arachnoid jMembrane is very thin, co- lourless, and transparent. On account of its ex- treme tenuity, and the close adhesion which it has to the third membrane of the brain,—the Pia Mater, it cannot be easily separated. There are, however, situations at the basis, where the arachnoid membrane, as it passes between opposite parts of the brain, can be seen distinct from the pia mater. It is the opi- nion of some anatomists, that the arachnoid mem- brane is reflected from the basis of the brain to the internal surface of the dura mater, giving to it its smooth apiiearance. 'Ihc Pia Mater diflers from the two membranes already described, in that it not only invests the whole apparent exterior of the brain, but also extends into the sulci betsveen the convolutions. 'Fhe Pia Mater is formed’of lamiflcaiion# of vessels connected by fine

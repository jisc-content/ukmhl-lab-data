21S so as to include it in a sort of loop, and then proceeds upwards and inwards into the neck, where it is placed in the loose cellular tissue which connects the pos- terior part of the trachea with the oesophagus. On the left side, the recurrent nerve arising from the par vagum lower down than on the right, turns round the arch of the aorta, so as to include it in a loop, and then ascending into the neck, is placed upon the front of the oesophagus where the tube projects be- yond the left side of the trachea. The two recurrent nerves reaching the lower part of the larynx, pass beneath the constrictor inferior muscle and divide into several filaments, some of which are distributed to the mucous membrane of the pharynx and larynx, but the greater number are distributed to the muscles moving the arytenoid cartilages, and have communi- cations with the filaments of the sujjcrior laryngeal nerve. The recurrent nerves distribute at their commence- ment, two or three fiiaments which join the cardiac nerves, and others which descend to the lungs. Lastly, in their course up the neck, they distribute filaments to the oesophagus, thyroid gland, and trachea. 2. The Pulmonary Nerves. As each par vagum passes downwards behind the bronchus, it separates into several filaments, which, uniting again, present a plexiform appearance. Many branches here arise from the nerve, some of which passing in front, and others behind the bronchi, form the an-

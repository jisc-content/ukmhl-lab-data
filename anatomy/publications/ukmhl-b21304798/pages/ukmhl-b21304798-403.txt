367 On each side of the patella, the membrane is covered by the aponeurotic expansion which is extended over the joint. Above, it is covered by the cruraeus mus- cle, and is so closely united to its tendon, that their separation cannot be effected. If we begin to trace the synovial membrane from the upper part of the joint, we find Lt covering the condyles of the femur, and continued upon the bone for some way beyond its cartilaginous surface. From the front of the femur, it is reflected loosely down- wards behind the tendon of the cruraeus, to the pos- terior surface of the patella which it lines, and then continuing its reflection downwards, it next covers both the upper and under surfaces of the semilunar cartilages, and is continued from them to the al<icular surfaces in the head of the tibia. From the middle of the head of the tibia, the synovial membrane is reflected upwards over the front and sides of the crucial ligaments, to their insertion into the femur. From the back part of the head of the tibia, it is reflected upwards to the posterior part of the con- dyles, and in this part of its course, it envelopes the tendon of the popliteus muscle. The synovial membrane forms a fold on each side of the patella, which is denominated the Ligamen- TUM Alare. These two folds arc united below the patella, and from the point of their union, a dupli- cature of the membrane is extended through the joint backwards, to the hollow between the condyles. Iâ€™his duplicature is named the Ligamentum Mucosum. R 4

167 The anterior portion of the digastricus is to be de- tached jfrom the jaw, and the sub-maxillary gland raised a little from its connexions, in order to bring the next muscle into view, which is The Mylo-Hyoideus. This is a broad and thin muscle, arising above from the oblique line in the inner side of the basis of the lower jaw, where it ex- tends from the chin backwards to the last molar tooth. From this origin, the front and middle fibres proceed obliquely downwards and inwards, and meet the corresponding fibres of the opposite muscle, with which they are united; a line, more or less dis- tinct in different subjects, is formed at their junction. The posterior fibres descend almost perpendicularly, and are attached to the upper border of the basis of the os hyoides. The mylo-hyoideus is to be carefully detached from the jaw, and reflected towards the opposite side of the neck, and immediately beneath it, is The Ge^iio-Hyoideus muscle, which arises from an eminence on the inside of the sympliysis of the lower jaw, above the attachment of the digastri- cus, and proceeding downwards and backwards, is inserted into the basis of the os hyoides. Between the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage, there is a short and narrow muscle, denominated The Thyro-Hyoideus. This muscle arises from the oblique line which extends across the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and proceeding directly up-

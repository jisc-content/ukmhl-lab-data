by fibres passing irregularly across from one bone to the other. The Obtuuator Fouamex is almost completely closed by a thin aponeurotic expansion, which is fixed to the whole circumference of the foramen, except at its upper part, where an aperture is left for the pas- sage of the obturator vessels and nerve. AltTlCULATION OF THE CLAVICLE WITH THE STERNUM. I'he ligaments belonging to this articulation arc An Anterior Ligament, consisting of a broad band of fibres attached above to the upper and front edge of the extremity of the clavicle, and thence de- scending obliquely upon the front of the articulation, to be fixed to the edge of the articular cavity in the sternum. A Posterior Ligament, consisting of a smaller band of fibres attached above, to the posterior edge of the extremity of the clavicle, and below, to the oppo- site edge of the sternum. An Interclavicular Ligament, which is a flattened band of fibres extended between the ex- tremities of the clavicles along the upper border of the sternum. An Interarticular Cartilage exists in this joint. It is thin and rounded at its edges. Its upper and lower surfaces are flattened in adaptation to the

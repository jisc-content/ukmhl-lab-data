98 branches, descend upon the sacrum, and terminate in communications with the arteria sacra media. Branches of the sacrae laterales, entering the holes in the sacrum, are distributed upon the cauda equina and its membranes. 3. Umbilicalis. 'The umbilical artery, forming an essential part of the foetal circulating system, is changed after birth into an impervious fibrous cord, which ascends obliquely along the side of the bladder, whence it continues its course upwards to the umbilicus. The artery, for a small distance after its origin from the internal iliac, remains pervious in the adult, and gives off the following branches: (a) Two or three vesical arteries distributed upon the side of the bladder. (b) Haemorrhoidal arteries distributed to the side of the rectum. (c) Branches distributed to the side of the uterus and vagina. 4. Vesicales usually consisting of one or more small arteries distributed to the bladder, but varying in number and size according to the number of arteries which the bladder derives from the other branches of the internal iliac. 5. H^morriioidalis Media, which is a large artery running along the front of the rectum to the sphincter. It communicates freely with the other ar- teries ot the gut and gives oflâ€™ branches to the blad- der, vesicula* seininales, prostate, and to the vagina. The ha?niorrhoidalis media is frequently given off

49 / placed close to the sides of the lumbaT vertebrae. It arises by distinct tendinous and fleshy portions from the transverse, processes, and from the sides of the bodies of the last dorsal, and of the four first lum- bar vertebrae, and descends on the outside of the supe- rior aperture of the pelvis. Then passing beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh, it becomes ten- dinous, and is united to the iliacus internus, with which it is inserted into the trochanter minor of the os femoris. The Psoas Parvus is a thin muscle placed in fn nt, and on the inside of the psoas magnus. It arises from the body of the last dorsal vertebra, de- scends obliquely outwards, and terminates in a thin tendon, which is continued downwards on the inside of the psoas magnus to the front of the brim of the pelvis, where it is fixed into the linea ilio-pectinea. This muscle is frequently wanting. The Iliacus Internus occupies the whole of the concavity of the ilium. It arises from the inner mar- gin of the crista ilii, nearly in its whole length, from the anterior superior spine, and from the concave surface of the bone, and descending beneath Pou- part’s ligament, becomes united with the tendon common to this muscle, and to the psoas magnus. From beneath Poupart’s ligament, the tendon de- scends into the thigh upon the capsule of the hip joint, and is attached to the trochanter minor of the os femoris.

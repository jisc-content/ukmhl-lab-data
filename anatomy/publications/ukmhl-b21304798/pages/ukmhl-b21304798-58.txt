24 form shape, placed obliquely beneath the liver, its wreat end, denominated the fundus, is turned for- wards and towards the right side, where it sometimes projects beyond the front edge of the liver; its small end, denominated the neck, is turned backwards and to the left. The gall bladder is closely united on one side, by cellular tissue, to the excavation in the liver, in which it is lodged ; and on the other side, the peritoneum covering the under surface of the Jiver, is extended over the bag. The gall bladder thus receives only a partial peritoneal covering. Occasionally, however, it is completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connecte d to the under surface of the liver by a small fold of the membrane. The Stomach is a bag large and capacious at one end, and gradually decreasing, is small at the other. Its two extremities ate simply deno- minated large and small. Of its surfaces, that which is presented to view is denominated superior or anterior ; and the opposite surface, which is at present concealed, inferior or posterior. It has two arches, one extending along the lower convex edge of the organ, denominated the great arch or curvature, the other extending along the upper concave edge, denominated the small arch or curvature. Of the two openings of the stomach, one is situated between the great ex- tremity and lesser arch, and is called the superior cardiac or oesophageal orifice, as the oesophagus here opens into the stomach, immediately after it has passed from the chest into the abdomen.

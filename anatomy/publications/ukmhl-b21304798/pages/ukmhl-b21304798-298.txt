262 inferior, terminate also in a pointed form at their union with the opposite muscle. The Constrictor Superior arises from the internal plate of the pterygoid process, from the back part of both jaws, close to the origins of the bucci- nator muscle, and from the side of the tongue at its basis. It proceeds transversely to the back of the pharynx, and here meets the opposite muscle. The uppermost of its fibres arc also attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone. The insertion of the stylo-pharyngeus is here seen. Its fibres pass beneath the constrictor medius, and are expanded upon the pharynx. The pharynx is now to be laid open in its whole length by dividing the constrictor muscles along the middle line of their union. By looking into the pharynx and towards the mouth, the soft palate, or velum palati, is seen with the uvula pro- jecting from its middle. The soft palate is united on each side to the pharynx and to the root pf the tongue by two folds of membrane containing mus- cular fibres, and presenting the appearance of half arches. These folds gradually separate from each other as they descend from the palate, the anterior terminating in the side of the tongue at its base, the posterior being lost in the side of the pharynx. By carefully reflecting the mucous membrane of the anterior fold, or half arch of the palate on either side, a few thin muscular fibres are brought into view, which form

407 CHAP. XX. DISTRIBUTION OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. The distribution of the Cerebral Nerves is for the most part described in the dissections of the several parts which they supply. It is only here necessary to describe the distribution of the second and third divisions of the fifth pair, and to complete the descrip- tion of the sixth and seventh pairs. The SuPERion Maxillary'Nerve, forming the second division of the fifth pair, proceeds from the Ganglion Gasserianum, rather obliquely out- wards and forwards to the foramen rotundum, through which it leaves the skull. From the foramen rotun- dum, it enters the space between the back part of the antrum and the pterygoid process, denominated the plerygo-maxillary fossa. It advances forwards in this space, imbedded in much cellular tissue, to the back part of the orbit. Here the neiâ€™ve enters the infra-orbitary canal, and having passed through it, emerges from the infra-orbitary foramen upon the

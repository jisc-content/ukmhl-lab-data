52 men, merely by removing the cellular tissue front the posterior surface and upper part of the os pubis. The wide space between Poupart’s ligament and the bone beneath is almost completely filled by the muscles, vessels, and nerves passing between the ab- domen and thigh. The iliacus internus and psoas magnus occupy the outer part and greater share of this space. The external iliac vessels descend over the smooth excavated surface in the upper and front part of the os pubis. The vein is found more in- ternally, and the artery close to the outer side of the vein, a thin stratum of condensed cellular tissue intervening. The anterior crural nerve, in pass- ing beneath Poupart’s ligament, is about half an inch from the artery on its outer side, some fibres of the psoas magnus projecting between them. Besides the parts here mentioned, small branches of the lum- bar nerves descend upon the iliacus internus and psoas magnus muscles, and the principal absorbent vessels of the lower extremity pass beneath Poupart’s liga- ment in their course from the thigh into the ab- domen. As the attachment of the fascia iliaca to Poupart’s ligament terminates just over the passage of the ex- ternal iliac vein, there remains in consequence a small space between the inner side of the vein and the cres- cent-shaped edge of the tendon, where Poupart’s liga- ment is not bound down to the parts beneath. This space is tilled by an absorbent gland, or only by

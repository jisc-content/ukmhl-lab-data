274 fibres of the constrictor muscles take their origin, viz., the pterygoid processes and back of the jaws, the cornu of the os hyoides, and sides of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. The pharynx is not to be regarded as a complete bag, since it is deficient anteriorly, where it is con- nected with the several parts w-hich have been de- scribed. Thus when we lay open the pharynx from behind, by a longitudinal incision, and look towards the front, we see above, the posterior openings of the nose, and below, the soft palate, the opening of the mouth, and the base of the tongue. Further, the larynx is seen projecting into the lower and front part of the pharynx. Between the basis of the tongue and the upper part of the larynx, is seen a flattened and moveable piece of cartilage, denominated the Epiglottis. Imme- diately below the epiglottis is the opening which leads into the larynx, denominated the Glottis. The sides of the pharynx are formed externally by the strata of muscular fibres, already described under the name of constrictorcs pharyngis, and internally, of the mucous membrane which lines the bag throughout, and is continued downwards into the mucous membrane of the oesophagus, and of the larynx and trachea. The terminations of the Eustachian Tubes in the pharynx are found at the upper and e.x- ternal part of the bag, above the soft palate, imme- diately behind the posterior openings of the nose,

68 The Acceleratores Urinx, covering the bulb and lower part of the corpus spongiosum urethi-ae. The Transversi Perinei running across from the tubcra ischii to the centre of the perineum. The Transversi Perinei Alteri also cross- ing the perineum, but more obliquely than the trans- versi. The Sphincter Ani surrounding the anus. The Erector Penis arises from the inside of the tuber ischii, and is a thin flat muscle which proceeds upwards upon the crus penis, and terminates above in a thin tendinous expansion which is lost in the corpus cavernosum *. The Accelerator UrinÂ® arises by a thin ten- dinous expansion from the ramus of the ischium and os pubis. Its fibres advance forwards on the inside of the crus penis, and proceed obliquely downwards, covering the bulb and lower part of the corpus spongiosum laterally, and terminating in their middle at a white line, where they meet the fibres of the opposite muscle. The superior fibres of the accele- rator form a distinct digitation which extends ob- liquely upw'ards and outwards, and terminates in the corpus cavernosum. The lower fibres of the accele- rator are connected with a tendinous point in the * The terms of locality employed in the desciption of this and of other muscles of the perineum refer to the po- sition of the parts, when the subject is tied up as for lithotomy.

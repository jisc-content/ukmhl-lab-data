310 nus, and covered only by the fascia and cellular tissue. It continues its course downwards beneath the aponeurotic expansion which connects the tendon of the biceps with the fascia of the forearm, and then enters the hollow just below the elbow-joint, between the flexor and pronator muscles on one side, and the supinator and extensor muscles on the other. Here it divides into the Radial arid Ulnar arteries. From thcjUlnar artery, the Interosseous artery is given off. The preceding description corresponds to that which is usually given of the division of the brachial artery into the arteries of the forearm, but the varieties are so numerous, that no given description can be relied upon, as invariably correct. The Radial, Ulnar, and Interosseous arteries, have been seen arising together at the bend of the arm. The most frequent distribution is, that the Radial is the first branch given off from the Brachial, which afterwards terminates in the Ulnar and Interosseous. The distribution next in frequency is, that the Ulnar is the first branch given off from the Brachial, which afterwards terminates in the Radial and Interosseous. The least frequent distribution is, that the Intcrosseotis is the first branch given off from the Brachial, which afterwards terminates in the Radial and Ulnar. Either of the three arteries of the forearm may arise from the brachial In any part of its course, even as high as its commencement from the axilla, thus forming what is called the high division. But it is to

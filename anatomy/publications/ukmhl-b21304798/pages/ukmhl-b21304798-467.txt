431 frequently several little eminences of a very hard texture. The office of the Mitral Valve corresponds to the office of the Tricuspid Valve. That portion of the mitral valve which is turned towards the origin of the aorta, is sufficiently large to cover the opening of the artery, when the valve lies flat against the sides of the ventricle. A second incision is now to be made through the anterior side of the left ventricle, along the line of its union with the septum, from the apex directly upwards into the Aorta. The Aorta arises from the upper and back part of the Left A'cntricle. The internal surface of the ventricle leading to the orifice of the artery has no projecting muscular fasciculi. Three Semilunar- Valves are placed around the commencement of the aorta, which differ from those of the pulmonary artery only in being thicker and stronger, and in having larger eminences, or Corpora Sesamoidca, at their â€¢ edges. v'^'^-Ciid the semilunar valves, the Aorta is dilated into three small pouches, which are denomi- nated its Sinuses. The Septum which divides the auricles, is gene- rally thin, but especially so towards the fossa ovalis. The Septum which divides the ventricles, varies much in its thickness at difl'erent parts. It does not belong particularly to either ventricle, the fibres of both are closely intermixed with it. The sides of the heart are formed of three distinct textures. The reflected pericardium forms the ex-

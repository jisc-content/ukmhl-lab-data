340 jaw, there is extended a thin aponeurotic expansion which gives origin to a part of the fibres of the stylo- glossus muscle. OF THE LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE HEAD WITH THE FIRST AND SECOND VERTEBRJE, AND THESE VERTEBR.E WITH EACH OTHER. For the preparation of these ligaments, the head, with the first and second vertebrjE, is to be separated from the rest of the spine. The skull-cap having been removed, two vertical sections of the occiput should be made down to the lateral margins of the foramen magnum, so that when the intermediate piece of bone is removed, the foramen may be laid widely open at its back part. The spinous processes of the first and second vertebrm are then to be sawn away, so as to expose the vertebral canal. The ligaments connecting the occiput with the atlas, arc An Anterior Lig.4ment, which is extended Irotn the edge of the foratnen magnum to the front part of the atlas, between its articular cavities. A Posterior Lk;.\ment, which is extended behind in the same manner from the edge of the foramen, to the back part of the atlas. A synovial membrane is found between the condyles and the superior articular surfaces of the atlas.

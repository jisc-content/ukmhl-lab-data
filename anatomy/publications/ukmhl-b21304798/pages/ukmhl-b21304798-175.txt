139 / interosseous ligament, and opens into the popliteal vein. The Anterior Tibiae Nerve is a branch of the Peroneal. In the dissection of the ham the course of the peroneal nerve was described, to the point where it penetrates between the peroneus longus and the fibula. It here divides into two branches, one the Anterior Tibiae, the other passing some way down between the peronei and extensor longus digitorum, then penetrates the fascia, and continues its course down the leg superficially, as already de- scribed. The anterior tibial nerve penetrates the up- per end of the peroneus longus and extensor longus digitorum to the front of the leg, where it is con- tinued downwards between the muscles, and in front of the anterior tibial artery. It passes with the an- terior tibial vessels beneath the annular ligament to the upper surface of the foot, and here divides into filaments, which are distributed to the foot, and ex- tend to the toes.

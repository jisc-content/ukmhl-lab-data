282 muscles extended between the occiput and the two first vertebrae. These are the Rectus Posticus Major and Minor, the Obliquus Superior, and Inferior. The Rectus Posticus Major arises from the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra; and ascending obliquely outwards, is inserted into the posterior part of the inferior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Beneath the preceding is. The Rectus Posticus Minor, which arises from the eminence at the back part of the atlas. It ascends, gradually increasing in breadth, and is in- serted into the rtiUgh hollow surface of the occipital bone, below the inferior transverse ridge, and close to the middle perpendicular line. Between the occiput and the transverse process of the atlas, is The Obliquus Superior, which arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and ascending ob- liquely backwards, is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone below the superior transverse ridge, and at the mid-distance between the middle perpendicular line and the mastoid process. Between the first and second vertebras, is The Obliquus Inferior, which arises from the spinous process of the vertebra dentata, and ascending obliquely outwards, is inserted into the transverse process of the atlas. Beneath the lower part of the complexus, is a

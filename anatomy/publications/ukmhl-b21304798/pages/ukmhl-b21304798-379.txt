343 Q 4 noath this longitudinal band, other fibres are seen crossing obliquely be tween the bodies of the vertebrae upon the intervertebral substances. The Posterior Vertebral Ligament consists of a band of fibres extended down the back parts of the bodies of the vertebrae, where they form the front of the spinal canal. The Intervertebral Substances occupy the intervals between the bodies of the vertebra throu"hout o the spine, except between the atlas and dentata. They are united very firmly above and below to the flat- tened surfaces of the vertebrae. Their general thick- ness increases gradually from above downwards, and on this account, there are more considerable distances between the lumbar vertebrae than between the cer- vical and the dorsal. In the neck, the intervertebral substances are thicker in front than behind, while in the back, the reverse arrangement takes place, and in the loins they are again thicker in their front parts. The interyertebral substances are formed of fibrous laminae, decussating each other, and having intervals between them, which are successively more consider- able towards the centre. These intervals are filled by a soft pulpy tissue, which is gradually increased in quantity towards the centre; and in the centre itself, each intervertebral substance consists altogether of this tissue without any intermixture of fibrous layers. When an intervertebral substance is im-

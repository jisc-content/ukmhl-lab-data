The Posterior Circumflex, which is usually a large branch arising at a short distance from the infra-scapular. It proceeds backwards, and winds round the neck of the humerus to the under surface of the deltoid, where its ramifications are principally distributed. The posterior circumflex is frequently a branch of the infra-scapular. 7. The Anterior Circumflex, which is a ' smaller branch than the preceding, passes forwards beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps around the front of the neck of the humerus, and ends in ramifications to the under surface of the deltoid. The circumflex arteries frequently have their ori- gin by a common trunk. The Axillary Vein is formed by a continua- tion of the basilic vein which ascends along the in- side of the arm. From the commencement of the axilla, the axillary vein proceeds obliquely upwards and inwards in the direction of the axillary artery beneath the clavicle into the neck. Here acquiring the name of Subclavian, it continues its course trans- versely inwards, and in front of the scalenus anticus, and then enters the chest. From the axilla to the

Q 6 ^47 and by synovial membranes, so that distinct joints are here formed. Each joint is strengthened by liga- mentous bands which arise from the extremity of the cartilage, and thence passing in front and behind the articulation, are expanded upon the sternum. By the union of the ligamentous bands from each side, a strong aponeurotic expansion is formed which covers the whole of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the sternum, and is very closely adherent to the bone beneath. There is no distinct joint formed between the first rib and the sternum, the cartilage and bone are so intimately united that they appear to be con- tinuous. The opposite edges of the cartilages of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and sometimes of the ninth ribs, which are in contact with each other in the front of the chest, are connected by loose synovial membranes, so that distinct motion is allowed between them. Between the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, ligamentous fibres are extended so as to hold them in their position. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. The union of the last lumbar vertebra with the sacrum resembles in every respect the union of the other vertebrae severally with each other. The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the alium by a ligament which is sometimes divided into

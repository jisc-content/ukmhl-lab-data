198 There are frequent varieties in the arrangement of these thoracic arteries. Very often, instead of one large inferior thoracic, there are three or four small branches arising' separately and running down the side of the chest. Occasionally, the inferior thoracic is a branch of the circumflex or of the infra-scapular arteries. 3. The Thoracica Humeraria, which is a small branch, and proceeds from its origin upwards and outwards, into the space between the deltoid and pectoralis major, where it ends in branches to the surrounding muscles. The thoracica humeraria is frequently a branch of the superior thoracic. 4. The Thoracica Alaris, a branch of un- certain size and origin, distributed to the axillary glands, and other parts in the axilla. 5. The Infra-Scapular, which is a large ar- tery arising near the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. Soon after its origin, it divides into two branches. One of them proceeds backwards nearly in tlie direc- tion of the inferior costa of the scapula, and distributes its ramifications to the subscapularis and other muscles adjacent. Some of these are reflected over the lower and back part of the bone to its dorsum, where they communicate with the branches of the supra-scapular. The other branch in which the infra-scapular ends, turns over the inferior costa of the scapula near its neck, and running under the teres minor and infra- spinatus, distributes its ramifications to these mus-

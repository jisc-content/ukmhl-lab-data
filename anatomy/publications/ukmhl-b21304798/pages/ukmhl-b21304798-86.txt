50 present to be followed below Poupai t’s ligament. The course of their tendon in the thigh to its insertion can- not be seen until the muscles of the thigh have been dissected. A thin aponeurotic expansion, denominated the fascia iliaca, covers the iliacus internus and the adjacent part of the psoas magnus muscles. The connexions of this fascia will be presently de- scribed. The Quadratus Lumborum is a thick and flattened muscle of an irregularly square form, placed by the sides of the lumbar vertebras, between the last rib and the ilium. Arising from the posterior mar- gin of the crista ilii, it ascends between the psoas magnus in front, and the fleshy mass of the sacro- lumbalis and longissimus dorsi behind, to be inserted into the last rib, and into the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebras. At this stage of the dissection, the student is ad- vised to observe the manner in which Poupart's liga- ment is firmly bound down to the subjacent parts by the attachments of certain fasciae, and further to no- tice the relative situation of the parts which occupy the wide space between Poupart’s ligament and the bone beneath. The Fascia Iliaca has been already mentioned as consisting of a thin aponeurotic expansion cover- ing the iliacus internus and the adjacent part of the psoas magnus muscles. On its outer edge, the fascia is attached to the internal border of the crista ilii, on

95 of veins, and is named the Plexus Retiformis. The anterior side of the vagina is united to the lower part of the bladder by loose cellular tissue, and to the urethra by a substance of a much firmer texture. On its pos- terior side, the canal is covered externally in its upper half by the peritoneum in its reflection from the uterus to the rectum, and in the rest of its extent it is united to the rectum by cellular tissue which is loose above, but lower down, is of so firm a texture as to render these parts hardly separable without injury. The situation of the female bladder corresponds to that of the male. The female bladder is, however, usually larger than that of the male, and has a dif- ferent form. It is rather of a triangular than oval shape, with its broadest part turned downwards, and extending transversely across the cavity of the pelvis. In the female, the bladder, when filled, acquires a rounded figure, and does not rise upwards to the same extent as in the male. The female urethra is betw'een one and tw'o inches in length. The canal is also of larger diameter, and more susceptible of dilatation than the urethra of the male. Beginning at the neck of the bladder, it proceeds almost horizontally forwards beneath the arch of the pubes to the pudendum, where it terminates by the orifice, named the meatus urinarius, the situation of which has been already described. The urethra is united to the arch of the pubes by two small slips of muscular fibres, corresponding to those de- â€¢cribed in the male, which descending from the bone,

430 The Left Ventricle is longer than the right, and its point extends farther downwards, so that the apex of the heart is altogether constituted by it. 1 he form of the left ventricle is conical, but flattened on that side by which it is united to the right ventricle. The two ventricles are joined together obliquely, so that the right forms the greater share of the convex surface of the heart, and the left, the greatest share of its flattened surface. An incision is to be^ made directly downwards from the Left Auricle, through the anterior side of the Left Ventricle to its apex. The internal surface of the Left Ventricle presents the same arrangement of CARNE.ii Column;?, as the right. They are, however, in some respects different. In the left ven- tricle, the fleshy columns are generally shorter and rounder than in the right, and the greater number of them have a longitudinal direction. Between the left auricle and ventricle, there is a valve corresponding to the Tricuspid valve on the right side. It is at- tached to the circumference of the auricular orifice of the ventricle. Its loose edge is divided into two por- tions, which somewhat resemble the points of a mitre. Hence the whole valve is called Mitral. The two portions of the mitral valve are connected with the CarncaD Columme of the left ventricle b}' tendinous threads, corresponding to those of the Tricuspid Valve. Several of the Chordae Tendinete are extended between the fleshy columns, and have no connexion with the Mitral Valve. The Mitral Valve is thicker than the Tricuspid, and in its loose edge there are

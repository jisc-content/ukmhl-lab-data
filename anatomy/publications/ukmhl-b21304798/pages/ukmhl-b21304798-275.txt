239 canal of the bone. It then terminates by distributing its branches upon the dura mater in an arborescent course which is marked by the grooves on the inside of the parietal bone. The branches of the Meningea Media communicate in front with the Anterior Me- ningeal Arteries, which are derived from the oph- thalmic, and behind, with the Posterior Meningeal Arteries which arise from the Vertebral and Occipital Arteries. (b) The Inferior Maxillary, or Dental Ar- tery, is a large branch which descends on the inside of the ramus of the jaw to the particular canal de- stined for it and its accompanying nerve. The artery passes forwards within the canal, sending branches upwards to the sockets of the teeth ; and reaching the foramen mentale, it divides into two branches, one continuing its course forwards within the canal for the supply of the incisor teeth, the other passing outwards through the foramen mentale upon the face, here ends in several branches which are distri- buted to the muscles of the lower lip, and communi- cate with the branches of the facial artery. (c) Branches distributed to the pterygoid muscles. (d) Temporales Profundal, which are generally two, ascending to the temporal muscle. (e) Buccal Branch distributed to the buccinator muscle. (y) Alveolar Branch, which is distributed to the gums of the upper jaw, and enters a canal in the bone for the supply of the teeth.

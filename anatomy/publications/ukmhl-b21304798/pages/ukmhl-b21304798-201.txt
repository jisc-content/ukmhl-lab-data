165 subjects, and is usually larger in the female. It is formed of two distinct lateral portions which are of a pyramidal shape. The broadest part of each is turned downwards and covers the upper rings of tlie trachea, and the narrow end extends upwards upon the side of the cricoid and upon the lower part of the thyroid cartilages. These two portions are united in front by a narrow slip of the gland which extends transversely across the front of the trachea, just below the cricoid cartilage. Sometimes, however, this transverse portion of the gland is wanting. Two Thyroideal Veins, of large size, ge- nerally descend from the gland along the front of the trachea into the chest, where they terminate either in the superior cava, or in the left subclavian vein. The student is next to proceed with the disscctiori of the muscles situated at the upper part of the neck, beginning with The Digastricus, which consists of an anterior and a posterior fleshy portion, and an intermediate tendon. The posterior portion arises from the groove behind the mastoid process, and proceeding obliquely downwards and forwards, terminates in a tendon which perforates the fibres of the stylo-hyoideus muscle, and is fixed to the cornu of the os hyoides by an aponeurotic expansion, the length of which varies in different subjects. The tendon is then re- flected upwards, and gives origin to fleshy fibres, forming the anterior portion of the muscle, which

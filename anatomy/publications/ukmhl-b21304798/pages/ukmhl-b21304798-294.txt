258 The Lacrymal Nerve proceeds along the outer side of the orbit between the periosteum and the rectus exlernus muscle to the lacrymal gland, in which its branches arc principally distributed, some few of its filaments extending to the upper eye-lid. The Nasal Nerve gives off a filament which is joined to the lenticular ganglion, then proceeding to the inner side of the orbit, it divides into two branches. One of these passes through the foramen orbitarium internum antcrius into the skull, and then proceeds through one of the holes in the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone into the nose, where it is distri- buted to the pituitajy membrane, principally upon the septum nasi. The other branch proceeds to the inner corner of the eye, and ends in filaments which are distributed to the muscles and integuments, and communicate with the infra-orbitary and facial nerves. The Supra-Orbitary, or. Frontal Nerve, proceeds forwards along the upper side of the orbit, immediately beneath the periosteum to the super- ciliary notch, through which it passes outwards upon the forehead. In its course through the orbit, the supra-orbitary nerve sends off a branch to the upper eye-lid. Its distribution upon the forehead has been described with the nerves of the face. The Lenticular Ganglion is a very small reddish body placed at the back part of the orbit, close to the outer side of the optic nerve ; its appear- ance and size vary much in diflerent subjects. Some-

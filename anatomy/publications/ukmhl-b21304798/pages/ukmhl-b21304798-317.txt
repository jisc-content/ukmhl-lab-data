281 the neck and the superior angle of the scapula. This is The Levator Scapul.e. It arises by distinct tendinous and fleshy portions from the transverse processes of the four upper cervical vertebra, and descending obliquely backwards, is inserted into the basis of the scapula, immediately below its superior angle. Beneath the splenius capitis is seen^ The CoMPLExus, which arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the transverse processes of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrre, and of the six lower cervical vertebra;, and ascending obliquely inwards, is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone between the superior and inferior transverse ridges, from the middle perpendicular line outwards, towards the mastoid process. Several distinct por- tions of tendon extend themselves irregularly through this muscle, and are firmly united with its fleshy fibres. Along the front edge of the complexus is a long slender muscle, denominated The Trachelo-Mastoideus, which arises by small tendons from the transverse processes of the four lower cervical, and sometimes of the first dorsal vertebicP, and ascending directly upwards, is inserU'd by a flattened tendon into the back part of the mastoid process. The complexus is to be reflected (rom the occiput, and beneath its upper part, there arc .seen four small

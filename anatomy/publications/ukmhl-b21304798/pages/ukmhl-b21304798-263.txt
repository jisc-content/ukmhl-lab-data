\ muscle, situated upon the side of the head just above the ear. Its fibres arising in a curved line from the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, con- verge in their descent, and end in a tendon, which is fixed to the upper part of the cartilage of the ear. The Anterior Auris is a very small muscle, situated upon the temple, in front of the ear. It arises from that part of the aponeurosis of the occi- pito-frontalis, which is over the middle of the zygoma, whence it proceeds backwards and a little downwards, and ends in a tendon which is attached to that part of the cartilage of the ear, denominated the helix. The Retrahens Aurem is situated behind the ear. It arises from the outer and back part of the mastoid process, and proceeding transversely for- wards, is attached to the back part of the cartilage of the ear. The appearance of this muscle varies considerably in different subjects. Frequently it is divided into two or three separate portions.

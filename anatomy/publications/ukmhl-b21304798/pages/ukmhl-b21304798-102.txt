6G ire attached to the inner borders of the rami of the ischium and pubes on each side. These attachments begin a little above the tubera ischii, and are then ex- tended upwards as far as the front and under part of the symphysis pubis. Thus the crura penis, arising from the rami of the ischia and pubes, advance forwards, and converging in front of the symphysis, unite and form the two corpora cavernosa. The corpora cavernosa are connected above with the symphysis pubis by a fibrous substance of a flat- tened and triangular form, denominated the sus- pensory ligament of the penis, but the exact limits of this part cannot be easily shewn, so closely is it in- terwoven with the surrounding fat and cellular tissue. The Corpus Spongiosum UrethrjE consists of a thin layer of spongy substance, surrounding the canal of the urethra, and it commences from behind, by an oblong pendulous projection, denominated the bulb of the urethra. The bulb projects below the line of the urethra, and is situated exactly in the mid-space between the crura penis a little before their union. The corpus spongiosum is continued forwards beyond the corpora cavernosa to form the glans penis. The glans is of a conical form and excavated at its basis ; the front extremities of the corpora cavernosa arc received into the hollow of the glans, and united with it by firm cellular tissue. The skin covering the penis is of a thin texture, and is united to the parts beneath by very Loose \

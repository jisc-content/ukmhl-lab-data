35 c 6 much to the inner concave side of the spleen. The branches of the splenic artery are, 1. PANCREATiCiE Parv^, which consist of many small arteries distributed to the pancreas. 2. Gastro-epiploica Sinistra, which aris- ing from the splenic as it passes beneath the sto- mach, is reriected to the great extremity, and con- tinues its course around the great arch towards the pyloric end of the organ. The Gastro-Epiploica Sinistra gives off, (a) Numerous branches to both surfaces of the stomach. (b) Branches, which pass downwards, and are distributed between the layers of the omentum. The Gastro-Epiploica Sinistra, having given off these branches, terminates by inosculating with the gastro-epiploica dexlra, which is a branch of the he- patic artery. 3. Vasa Brevia, which consist of three or four small branches, distributed upon the great end of the stomach. As the splenic artery approaches to the spleen, it div des mto several branches, which entering the concave side of the organ, ramify through it, and some of them perforating its opposite side terminate in the diaphragm. The Hepatic Artery is usually of a middle size between the coronaria ventriculi and the splenic. Arising from the right side of the coeliac, it ascends towards the under surface of the liver, and

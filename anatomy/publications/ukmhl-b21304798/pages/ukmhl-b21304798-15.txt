A 2 PREFACE. This Work is strictly for the Dissecting Room. Its Objects are, to describe accurately the several parts of the Human Body, and to give practical directions for the most convenient method of dissecting them. It has no other Plan but to arrange the several Regions of the Body in the order most conve- nient for their examination, and to describe each part successively according to its natural situa- tion. Let the Reader, who turns from the perusal of Systematic Works to this Manual, recollect, that it is intended only for Practical Beginners in the Science, to facilitate their first difficulties, and to furnish them with the sort of instruction I which they especially require. The Uses of the Muscles are omitted, inas- much as being a part of Physiology, their explanation would exceed the objects of' the work.

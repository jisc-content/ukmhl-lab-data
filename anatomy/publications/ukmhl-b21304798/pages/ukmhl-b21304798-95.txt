59 proceeds upwards and inwards to the under surface of the rectus, behind which it ascends obliquely from the lower and outer edge of the muscle, towards its upper and inner part. The epigastric gives off near its commencement, (a) A branch which accompanies the spermatic cord through the abdominal ring, and communicates with the spermatic artery. In females, this branch accompanies the round ligament of the uterus. (d) Branches which, arising from each side of the trunk as it ascends beneath the rectus, are distributed to the surrounding muscles, and communicate with the branches of the circumllexa ilii, lumbar and intercostal arteries. The epigastric terminates near the umbilicus, in branches communicating with the branches of the internal mammary artery, which is derived from the subclavian. The epigastric does not always arise from the same point of the external iliac. In some instances it has its origin higher than in others, and sometimes the epigas- tric arises by a common trunk with the obturator ar- tery, which is usually derived from the internal iliac. 3. The CiRCUMFLEXA Ilii, which arises from the outer side of the external iliac, sometimes opposite to the epigastric, and sometimes a little below it. From its origin it proceeds obliquely upwards and outwards to the crista ilii, round which it turns upon the iliacus internus muscle. Its branches partly distribute them- selves to the iliacus and psoas muscles, and partly D 6 /

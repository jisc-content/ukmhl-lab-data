118 of the trochanter major, from the outer side of the linea aspera, and from nearly the whole external surface of the os femoris. Soon after its origin, it overlaps the cruraeus and becomes connected with it in the rest of its course down tlie thigh. Towards its termination, the fibres proceed obliquely forwards, and are inserted, partly into the edge of the tendon of the rectus, and partly by distinct tendinous fibres into the side of the patella. The Vastus Intejeinus arises from the fore part of the trochanter minor, from the inside of the linea aspera and from the whole internal side of the os femoris as far as the condyle. Its fibres proceed obli- quely forwards, and are inserted partly into the edge of the tendon of the rectus, and partly by a tendinous at- tachment into the side of the patella. The fibres of the vastus internus are intimately connected in the greater part of their course with the fibres of the cruraeus. An aponeurosis is extended downwards from the tendon of the rectus and from the tendinous attach- ments of the vasti, over the front of the patella and sides of the knee. Below^, it is connected with the liga- mentura patellae and with the head of the tibia, and is joined to the fascia ot the leg. In its passage over ' the sides of the knee, this aponeurosis is united to the capsule of the joint by cellular tissue. The CruK/Eus arises from the front of the os fe- moris, where it begins above between the trochanter major and minor, and thence extends a considerable way downw.ards, and is in great part overlapped by

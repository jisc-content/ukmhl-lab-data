108 rate them in the least degree from their lateral con- nexions, so that he may be enabled to learn the name of each muscle as it lies in its natural situation. Immediately on the outer side of the femoral ves- sels, and anterior crural nerve, the Psoas Magnus and Iliacus Internus muscles arc seen descending to- gether in one mass beneatli Poupartâ€™s ligament into the thigh.' On the outer side of this mass, the Sartorius muscle is seen attached above, to the anterior supe- rior spine of the ilium, and thence winding obliquely round the front and inside of the thigh down below the knee. On the outer side of the sartorius, is a small muscle, the Tensor Vaginae, descending from the an- terior superior spine of the ilium along the outer side of the thigh. Immediately on the inside of the femoral vessels and crural nerve, and rather behind the former, is the Pcctinalis muscle, attached above to the front of the os pubis. Next to the pectinalis, is a large mass of muscle occupying the inside of the thigh at its upper part, and denominated the Triceps. Next to the triceps, is a long slender muscle, the Gracilis, running straight from the symphysis pubis down below the knee. On the outer side of the thigh, at its lower part, is the Vastus Externus muscle.

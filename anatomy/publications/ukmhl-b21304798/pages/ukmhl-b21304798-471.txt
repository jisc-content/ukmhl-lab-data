435 The larynx is formed of Cartilages, from which the organ derives its form and solidity ; of Ligaments, by which the cartilages are connected together; of Mus- cles moving the cartilages ; of iSIucous Glands ; and lastly, of a Membranous Lining. The cartilages are five in number; the Thyroid, Cricoid, two Arytsenoid cartilages, and the Epiglottis. The Thyroid and Cricoid cartilages have been described in the dissec- tion of the neck. The first of these forms the front and sides of the larynx. The second is situated at its lower part. The Arytaenoid cartilages are situ- ated at the back part of the larynx, upon the upper border of the cricoid. They are of a pyramidal and triangular figure. Their points incline a little back- wards, or towards the pharynx. Their bases are articulated to the cricoid cartilage, and their internal flattened sides are turned towards each other. The Epiglottis is flattened, and somewhat of an oval form. One of its surfaces is turned towards the tongue, and the other towards the superior opening of the larynx. Its upper border is rounded, and turned forwards towards the mouth; and when the cartilage is com- pletely detached from its connexions, its lower border is seen to have a pointed form. The Thyroid cartilage is connected with the Cricoid in front, by a membrane extended between their opposite borders, and at the sides, by two dis- tinct articulations, formed between the inferior cornua of the thyroid cartilage, and the lateral surfaces of the cricoid. These articulations arc covered by syno- u 2

411 T ^ membrane of the mouth, next between the mylo- hyoideus and hyo-glossus muscles, where it is accom- .. panicd by the submaxillary duct. Its further course is described in the dissection of the neck. At a short distance below the tissura Glaseri, the lingual nerve receives the chorda tympani, which is joined to it at an acute angle pointing downwards. We may observe that the lingual nerve is increased in size after its junction with the chorda tympani. The Nerve of the Sixth Pair has been de- scribed as passing through the cavernous sinus, close to the outer side of the carotid artery. Immediately above the superior orifice of the canalis carotideus, the nerve receives the two communicating filaments from the superior cervical ganglion of the Sympa- thetic. Sometimes one filament only from the gan- glion proceeds to the abductor nerve, the other filament having terminated at its junction with the Vidian branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The communicating filaments join the abductor nerve at an acute angle pointing forwards, and it is to be re- marked, that after the junction, the abductor nerve is increased in its size. The PoRTio Dura of the seventh pair, or the Facial Nerve, leaving the auditory nerve at the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, enters the aquas- ductus Fallopii, and passes through it to its termina- tion at the foramen stylo-mastoideum. Within the aquseduct, the facial nerve receives the cranial branch of the Vidian nerve. It then gives off filaments to the

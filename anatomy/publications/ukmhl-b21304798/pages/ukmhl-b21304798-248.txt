212 only by loose cellular tissue, from the first bone of the sternum. The first branches which the aorta gives off, are for the supply of the heart itself. These are named the Coronary Arteries, and will be described with the dissection of the heart. From the convex side of the arch of the aorta, three great branches usually arise, the Arteria Innominata, the Left Carotid, and the Left Subclavian. The Arteria Innominata, which is the first of the three branches, arises from the arch near its summit, and ascends obliquely to the right upon the trachea, and beneath the left subclavian vein. After a course of between one and two inches, the arteria innominata divides into the Right Subclavian and Right CAHOTin artprips. The Right Subclavian Artery proceeds ob- liquely upwards and outwards into the neck to the â€˜space between the scalenus anticus and racdius muscles. The Right Carotid Artery ascends with a slight obliquity outwards to the right side of the neck. The Left Carotid Artery arises from the arch of the aorta, nearly at the same level with the arteria innominata, and ascends obliquely outwards to the left side of the neck. Ihe Left Subclavian Artery arises from the arch just before the aorta descends upon the dorsal

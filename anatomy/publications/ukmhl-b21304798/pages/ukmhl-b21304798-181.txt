145 rotic partitions connecting it with the muscles on each side. Its fibres descend, continuing their attachments nearly all the way down the leg. At the lower part, they terminate obliquely in a tendon which proceeds through a groove in the lower end of the tibia, behind the malleolus internus, and is reflected forwards to be fixed to the os naviculare, to the internal cuneiform bone, and to the ligaments connecting the bones of the tarsus. The tendons of the three muscles last described, are confined by fibrous sheaths, where they pass through grooves in the tibia, os calcis, and astra- galus. VESSELS AND NERVES IN THE BACK OF THE LEG. The Posterior Tibial Artery descends from the ham to the lower end of the tibia between the soleus and flexor longus digitorum muscles. As the artery descends, it becomes gradually more superficial, and in the lower part of its course is covered only by cel- lular tissue and by the fascia. Following the direc- tion of the flexor tendons, it passes behind the mal- leolus internus into the hollow on the inside of the os calcis. Here it is lodged with the tendons and with the Posterior Tibial Nerve behind the broad band of tendinous fibres which extends from the malleolus internus to the os calcis. It then passes beneath the abductor pollicis, and terminates by dividing into H

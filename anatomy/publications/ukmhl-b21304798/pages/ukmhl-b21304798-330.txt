294 descending along the inside of the arm, ends in branches, which communicate about the internal condyle with the\ Recurrens Ulnaris from the fore- arm. The profunda inferior is frequently a branch of the profunda superior. 3. The Ramus Anastomoticus arises from the inside of the trunk, within a short distance of the elbow joint, and passing towards the inner condyle ends in branches, which communicate above, with the profundas, and below, with the recurrent arteries of the forearm. It will frequently happen, that instead of one large ramus anastomoticus there are two or three smaller branches given off from the brachial trunk, just above the elbow joint. Besides these branches, the brachial artery gives off many ramifications to the muscles in its course down the arm. The principal veins seen in the dissection of the upper arm, are the Veka Basilica, the Veka Ce- PHALiCA, and the Venje Comites. The Vena Basilica passes up the inside of the arm, on the inner or ulnar side of the brachial ar- tery, and rather in front of die median nerve. From the upper part of the arm, the basilic vein is con- tinned into the axilla, and here takes the name of axillary. The Veka Cephalica passes up the outside of the arm, above the fascia, and near the outer edge of

38 liver, the vena portae divides into two branches, which ramify through its substance. The omentum and transverse arch of the colon are now to be turned upwards upon the chest, and the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon is to be carefully divided at its back part, close upon the spine, in order to expose the superior mesenteric artery at the part where it enters between the layers of the mesentery. Its origin and the first part of its course must be left for the next stage of the dissection. The Supf.iuoa Mesenteric Artery arises from the aorta at a short distance below the cceliac. From its origin it passes downwards first behind the pancreas, then over the duodenum and under the mesocolon. From beneath the mesocolon it enters between the layers of the mesentery, where it proceeds downwards and forwards, gradually bending towards the right iliac region. In the latter part of its course, the superior mesenteric artery forms an arch with its conve.xity turned downwards and for- wards, and inclining to the left side. From the con- cavity of the arch there arise the following arteries : 1. CoLiCA Media, which proceeds between the layers of the mesocolon towards the transverse arch, and divides sooner or later into two branches, one â€¢ passing across the mesocolon to the right side, ends by inosculating with an ascending branch of the colica dextra, which is next to be described ; the other, passing across the mesocolon to the left side, ends by

170 The Hyo-Glossus is a broad and thin muscle, placed more outwardly than the genio-glossus, and extended between the cornu of the os hyoides and the side of the tongue. It arises below from a part of the body and from the whole length of the cornu of the os hyoides, and then proceeding upwards is in- serted into the side of the tongue. Another muscle of the tongue remains to be de- scribed, which is the Lingualis, but this will be more conveniently examined hereafter, with the structure of the tongue itself in the dissection of the nose, mouth, and larynx. In this stage of the dissection, are seen the Excre- tory Duct of the Submaxillary Gland, the Hypo- glossal Nerve, and the Lingual or Gustatory branch of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve. The SuBMAXiLLAUY DucT is of a large size, and formed of thin and transparent coats. It leaves the gland close to the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoidei:s, and then proceeding horizontally inwards between the mylo-hyoideus and hyo-glossus, perforates the mu- cous membrane of the mouth close by the side of the frsenum of the tongue. The Sublingual Gland is also here brought into view. This is the smallest of the salivary glands, it is of a flattetied figure, and narrower from side to side than from above downwards. It lies im- mediately under the tongue, between the mylo- hyoideus and gonio-glossus. The superior mar- gin of the gland projects into the mouth, and is covered

160 greater number accompany the deep-seated vessels. These latter form altogether one connected chain of glands extending down the side of the neck, and arc hence denominated Glandulje Concatenate. At the lower part < of the neck there are nume- rous glands of large size, and from these, others are continued downwards behind the clavicle into the axilla. The Sterno-Cleido-Mastoideus is a broad and thick muscle extended obliquely along the side of the neck. Below, it has two distinct attachments, between which there is an interval filled only by cel- lular tissue. One attachment is by a thick tendon to the upper border of the sternum at its front part; the other is by short aponeurotic fibres to the upper part of the clavicle, occupying about an inch and a half of the bone near its sternal end. That portion of the muscle arising from the sternum ascends obliquely backwards to the clavicular portion, in front of which it passes. The two portions thus unite into one muscle, which is inserted above by aponeurotic fibres into the upper and back part of the mastoid pro- cess, and into the ridge which is extended from it some way backwards across the occipital bone. The mastoid muscle is next to be divided across its middle, and each half is to be reflected towards its attachment. In the reflection of the upper half, the nervus accessorius will be seen beneath it. The Nervus Accessorius forms one of the di- visions of the eighth pair of the cerebral nerves. It

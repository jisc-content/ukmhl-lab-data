93 The Fallopian Tubes are two small and tor- tuous canals between four and five inches in length. Each tube arising from the upper angle of the uterus proceeds transversely outwards in the upper part of the broad ligament. At its termination each tube presents an expanded orifice, the margin of which is divided into separate portions so as to have a fringed , appearance; hence it is denominated the fimbriated extremity. This extremity of the fallopian tube per- forates the peritoneum, by which a communication is formed between the interior of the tube and the cavity of the abdomen. The diflerent portions into which the extremity of the fallopian tube is divided are not all of the same length, and the longest of them is extended backwards to the ovary of the same side, with which it is connected. The Ovaries are two whitish bodies of an oblong and flattened figure enclosed within the broad liga- ments, but more especially connected with their pos- terior layer. A small fibrous cord, named the Liga- ment of the ovary is attached to each of these bodies on their inner sides. At its other extremity this cord is fixed to the upper angle of the uterus behind the fallopian tube. The Round Ligaments are two whitish cords arising from the upper angles of the uterus in front of and rather below the Fallopian tubes. Each round li- gament proceeds from the uterus outwards and rather upwards within the broad ligament, and then ascends on the inside of the external iliac vessels to the aper- %

386 fluid in the ventricles, the two apertures are widened, and more obviously apparent. The body of the fornix is to be divided transversely in its middle, and its anterior part is to be turned forwards. The two anterior crura will then be dis- tinctly brought into view. The posterior part of the fornix is to be turned backwards. It will then be seen that the triangular space between the posterior crura is occupied by a layer of white substance, the under surface of which is marked by several trans- verse and oblique lines on each side, producing the appearance named the Psalterium, or Lyra. Beneath the fornix is a thin membranous expan- sion, denominated the Veeum. It is extended over the cavity of the third ventricle, and upon the emi- nences named the Thalami Optici. The velum cor- responds in its siae and shape to the fornix. It is formed by a production of the pia mater, which is continued from the exterior of the brain into the ventricles. The pia mater passes into the ventricles through a transverse fissure, which is found beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. If the posterior border of the corpus callosum is carefully divided in its middle, and then gently raised on either side of the incision, the continuity between the velum and the external pia mater will be distinctly seen. The velum is joined by its lateral edges, and in front, to the Choroid Plexuses. Its upper surface is united to the fornix by numerous fine vessels, and its under

76 turn, and the lower extremity attached to it, may then be removed without further trouble, and the vis- cera will be left resting in the right os innominatum, and in the hollow of the sacrum. Afterwards, the blad- der is to be moderately distended with air blown into it from the ureter, its escape being prevented by a ligature passed tightly round the penis. The rectum is also to be moderately distended with horse hair or tow. The course of the peritoneum through the cavity of the pelvis, and its inflections upon the blad- der and rectum, are in the first place to be ex- amined. The peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles de- scends from them in front, and passes behind the ossa pubis into the pelvis, to the middle of the supe- rior part of the bladder, named its fundus. The membrane is thence continued backwards upon the bladder, and down the whole of its posterior and lateral parts. From the lower and back part of the bladder the peritoneum is continued to the front of the rectum, and leaves, by the mode of its re- flection, a pouch between the two organs. The hand will readily enter this pouch, when passed downwards between the bladder and rectum. From each side ut the bladder the peritoneum is extended outwards upon the walls of the pelvis. According to the preceding account, we find that the bladder is covered by peritoneum over one half only of its fundus, and over the whole of its posterior part, while the antenor half of its fundus, and its whole

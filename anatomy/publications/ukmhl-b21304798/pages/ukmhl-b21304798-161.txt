125 G 3 The IscHiATic Artery, passing out of the. pelvis through the lower part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch, and below the pyriformis, descends towards the thigh beneath the glutfeus maximus, and distri- butes its ramifications downwards between the tuber ischii and trochanter major, where they communicate freely with the upper perforating branches of the pro- funda, and with the internal circumflex artery. The Pudendal Artery passing out of the pelvis, through the lower part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch, turns downwards beneath the posterior ischiatic ligament, and enters the pelvis again through the lesser sacro-ischiatic notch. Its further course will be described with the arteries of the pelvis. The Ischiatic Nerve passing out of the pelvis with the ischiatic artery, and below the pyriformis muscle, descends over the gemelli and obturator internus into the space between the tuber ischii and trochanter major, to. the back part of the thigh. JNIany small branches of the sacral nerves pass out- wards through the posterior sacral holes and great ischiatic notch, and terminate in the glutaei and adja- cent muscles. MUSCLES ON THE BACK PART OF THE THIGH. V Upon the reflection of the fascia, three muscles are exjioscd. The Biceps, formed of two portions, placed along the outer side of the thigh.

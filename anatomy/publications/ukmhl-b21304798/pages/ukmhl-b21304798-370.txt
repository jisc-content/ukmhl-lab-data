< .15 S and os trapezium. Neither of these lateral ligaments are well defined, their edges being irregularly con- nected with the ligamentous bands next described. Anterior and Posterior Ligamentous Bands, which proceed from the front and back edges of the articular cavity of the radius, and are attached to the first or upper row of the carpal bones. An Interarticuear Cartilage is placed between the extremity of the ulna and the bones of the carpus, which occupies the vacancy here seen in the skeleton. By this caitilage, the articulation between the forearm and the carpus is separateil into an upper and lower division, each having a dis- tinct synovial membrane. The upper division is formed by the extremity of the ulna above, and by the opposite surface of the interarticular cartilage be- low. The lower division constitutes the proper joint of the wrist, and is formed by the following parts:—The inferior articular surface of the radius, and the inferior surface of the cartilage just mentioned, present together a concavity, oblong, or elliptical transversely, which is adapted to the uniform con- ve.xity presented by the superior surfaces of the three first bones of the carpus, viz., the scaphoides, 1 unarc, and cuneiforme. I he synovial membrane, which belongs to the up- per division of this articulation, covers the e.xtremity of the ulna and the upper surface of the interarticu- lar cartilage, and is reflected upwards, as already stated, into the articulation between the opposite sides i

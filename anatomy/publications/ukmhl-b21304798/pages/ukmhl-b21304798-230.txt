194 frequently arise as distinct branches of the sub- clavian. 3. The Superior Intercostal arises from the posterior part of the subclavian. It first proceeds backwards, and then turns suddenly downwards in the chest over the necks of the fii-st and second ribs, where it ends in branches to tho intercostal muscles, which communicate with the intercostal branches of the aorta. 4. The Vertebral, which is tho largest branch, arises from the upper part of tho subclavian. It has its origin deep in the neck, and proceeds directly upwards to the holes in tho transverse processes of the vertebree. It generally enters them at the sixth vertebra, occasionally at the seventh, and some- times not until it has reached the third. It continues its course directly upwards from one transverse pro- cess to another as far as the atlas. Here, having turned outwards, it passes through the transverse pro- cess of this vertebra, and again suddenly bending in- wards, passes along the groove in the upper surface of the bone to the foramen magnum, through which it enters the cranium. Sometimes the groove in the atlas is formed into a complete bony canal. It is to be remarked, that when the vertebral artery does not enter the transverse processes until it has reached as high as the fourth or third vertebra, it has its course along the neck close upon the spine behind the common carotid artery.

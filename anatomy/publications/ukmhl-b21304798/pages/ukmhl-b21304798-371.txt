S59 ot the radius and ulna. This synovial membrane is denominated, from its looseness, the Membrana Capsularis Saccieormis. The synovial membrane, which belongs to the lower division of the articulation forming the joint of the wrist, is simply spread over the concave sur- faces of the radius, and of the interarticular carti- lage, and is reflected downwards upon the convex sur- faces of the three carpal bones. The joint of the wrist is strengthened by numerous ligamentous bands, which confine the several tendons passing over it in their course from the forearm to the hand and fingers. The Anterior Annular Ligament of the wrist is a very thick band of ligamentous fibres, ex- tended transversely across the front of the carpusÂ» At one extremity, it is attached to the os scaphoides and os trapezium, and at the other, to the os pi- siforme and to the curved process of the os unci- forme. articulations between the carpal BONES. . One synovial membrane serves by its reflections for the articulations between the two rows of carpal bones, and for the articulation of each particular bone with that which is contiguous to it.

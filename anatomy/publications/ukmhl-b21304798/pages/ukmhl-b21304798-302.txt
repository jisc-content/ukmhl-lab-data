266 CHAP. XIII. OF THE NOSE, MOUTH, AND PHARYNX. For the examination of these parts a perpendicu- lar section is to be made of the head and face, di- rectly through their middle; and in dividing the nose, the student must be careful that the saw penetrates between the spongy bones and the septum narium, in order that the latter may be left uninjured, with one half of the section. The division of the face is to extend completely through the superior maxillary bone into the mouth, but the lower jaw is to be left entire. A full view will thus be gained of all the parts, which are now to be described. OF THE NOSE.

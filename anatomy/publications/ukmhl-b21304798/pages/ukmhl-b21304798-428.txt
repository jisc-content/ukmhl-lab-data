392 nences are rather the highest, and are called the Nates, and the two posterior, the Testes. From the two posterior eminences, or Testes, a thin layer of grey and white substance is extended ob- liquely downwards and backwards to the cerebellum. This is the Valve of the fourth ventricle. It is united by its lateral edges to two rounded cords, named the Processus a Cerebello ad Testes, extended between the testes and cerebellum. The two nerves of the fourth pair arise from the external surface of the valve, near its union with the cords just mentioned. By dividing the valve along its middle, the Fourth Ventricle, or Ventricle of the Cerebellum will be opened. This is a cavity of considerable extent, situated between the cerebellum, tuber annu- lare, and the back part of the medulla oblongata. Its posterior boundary is formed by the valve, itÂ« an- terior boundary by the medulla oblongata, its lateral boundaries by the processus a cerebello ad testes, and by the crura cerebelli. It communicates above, with the canalis medius, and below, it is closed by the pia mater, which extends across from the cerebellum to the medulla oblongata. Along the middle of the anterior side of the fourth ventricle, there is a narrow groove ending below in a point. This is the Cala- mus ScRiPTORius. On each side of this groove there are two or three transverse streaks of white sub- stance. These arc regarded as the origins of the auditory nerves.

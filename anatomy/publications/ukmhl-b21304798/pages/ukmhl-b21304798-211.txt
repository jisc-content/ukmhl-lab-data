I 4 1. The Superior Thyroid Rrises usually at the comincncemrnt of the external carotid, and descends in a serjjentine course to the thyroid gland, where it terminates in branches which ramify through the gland, and communicate freely with the other thy- roid arteries. The superior thyroid gives off in its course to the thyroid gland many small arteries to the surrounding j)arts, and one branch in particular, denominated (rt) The Laryngeal, which enters the larynx with the superior laryngeal nerve, either by pene- trating the membranous connexion between the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage, or by passing through a hole in the ala of the thyroid cartilage itself. It supplies the internal parts of the larynx. 2. 1 he Lingual arises behind the posterior por- tion of the digastric us by which it is concealed, and proceeds almost horizontally forwards and inwards above the os hyoides, and under the hyo-glossus. It then bends upwards to the lower and back part of the tongue, and here ends by dividing into two branches, denominated Sublingual and Ranine. The lingual artery gives off in its course to the tongue, a branch, denominated (a) The Dorsalis LingujE, which arises near the insertion of the stylo-glossus, and proceeds up- wards and outwards to the dorsum of the tongue and epiglottis. The Sublingual is the more superficial of the two branches in which the lingual artery ends. It ad-

tipon which they lie, is continuous with the fascia lata covering the pectinalis muscle. Three or four Absorbent Glands are found beneath the fascia lata at the upper part of the thigh, and generally close to the femoral vessels. BRANCHES OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 1. Small arteries to the inguinal glands. 2. The External Pudics, which are two or three small branches distributed to the external organs of generation as the scrotum, penis, and labia pudendi. They communicate with the ramifi- cations of the internal pudendal arteries which are distributed to the same organs. The external pudics sometimes arise from the profunda. 3. The Profunda, which arises from the fe- moral at about an inch and a half or two inches below Poupartâ€™s ligament, is of so large a size, that it seems to be formed by a division of the femoral artery into two equal branches, one super- ficial, which is the continued trunk, the other deep- seated, named the profunda. At its origin, the pro- funda is covered by the femoral trunk, and it descends obliquely backwards upon the triceps, and down the inside of the femur almost to its middle, where it ends in two branches, denominated Perforating Arteries. These penetrate be- tween the fibres of the triceps, and are distributed to

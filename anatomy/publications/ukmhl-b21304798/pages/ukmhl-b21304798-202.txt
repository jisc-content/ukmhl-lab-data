166 ascends obliquely to the basis of the jaw, where it is attached to a depression in the bone near its symphy- sis, and close to the muscle of the opposite side. The tendon of the digaslricus sometimes passes behind the stylo-hyoideus instead of perforating its fibres. In the triangular space between the digastricus and the inner surface of the basis of the jaw, is found. The Submaxillary Gland, which is of a roundish form. It lies imbedded in loose cellular tissue, and is surrounded by many absorbent glands. It is extended outwards to the angle of the jaw, where it is sometimes connected with the lower end of the parotid gland. A portion of the submaxillary gland is frequently continued inwards beneath the posterior edge of the Mylo-Iiyoideus muscle. Close to the posterior portion of the digastricus, is the Stylo-Hyoideus muscle, which arises ten- dinous from the styloid process, and proceeding downwards and forwards, follows the direction of tlie posterior portion of the digastricus, by the tendon of which it is generally perforated. It is then con- tinued to the Os Hyoides to which it is attached near to the junction of the basis and cornu. The stylo-hyoideus is sometimes accompanied by another muscle which has the same origin and in- sertion, and is denominated the Stylo-Hyoideus Alter.

124 The Quadratus Femoris, which, arising from the external side of the tuber ischii, proceeds across between the gemellus inferior and the upper fibres of the adductor magnus, to be fixed by a broad attach- ment to the posterior and inferior part of the tro- chanter major. The quadratus femoris being reflected from the trochanter major, the insertion of another muscle is brought into view, The Obturator Externus, which has a broad origin from the front of the os pubis, and from the external surface of the obturator ligament; its fibres proceeding outwards, converge into a tendon which passes beneath the neck of the femur, where it ad- heres to the capsule, and is attached to the cavity at the root of the trochanter major, below the gemellus inferior. 0 VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE BUTTOCK. The Glutjeal Artery passing out of the pelvis through the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch, above the pyriformis and beneath the glutjeus maximus, almost immediately divides into two bran- ches, one superficial, the other deep-seated. The superficial branch distributes its ramifications be- tween the glutajus maximus and medius. The deep- seated branch, covered by the glutasus medius, rami- fies upon the muscles, and gives off one branch in particular, which extends across the dorsum ilii, so as to form an arch along the glutajus minimus.

ass'" The Internal InTercostals extend from the sternum backwards to the angles of the ribs, so that between the angles and the spine, there exists only the external layer of fibres. The internal intercostal muscles arise from the lower edge of each rib, and proceeding obliquely downwards and backwards, are inserted into the upper edge of the next rib in suc- cession. Small portions of muscular fibres, distinct from the intercostals, are seen passing obliquely between the ribs on their insides. These vary in their number and situation. Their direction corresponds to that of the external intercostals. The posterior surfaces of the sternum and cartilages of the ribs on each side arc covered by a muscle, de- nominated The Triangularis Sterni, which arises from the posterior surface and lateral edges of the lower half of the sternum, and from the ensiform cartilage ; its fibres ascending obliquely outwards, are inserted by distinct digitations into tlie posterior surfaces of the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs.

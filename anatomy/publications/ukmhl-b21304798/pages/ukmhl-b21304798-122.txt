By st parating the labia, the following parts are ' seen in succession from above downwards. A conical eminence of a reddish colour, which is the Glans CuiToaiDis. This is only a small part of tlie clitoris. Hereafter tire clitoris w ill be seen arising by two cruia resembling the crura pt'nis which are attached to the inside of the rami of the ischia and pubes. The crura approach each other as they ascend towards the arch of the pubes, and unite in the body of the clitoris, which is of a cylindrical shape and lies between the upper side of the vagina and the under jtart of the arch of the pubes, and is terminated in front by the glans already mentioned. 'I’hc glans is covered above and at the sides by a loose fold of membrane .which is named the Preputium Clitoridis. A white sebaceous substance is deposited between the preputium and the glans, similar to that which is secreted by the glandula; odoriferae of the penis. From the preputium clitoridis, two thin mem- branous folds descend on the in»ide of the labia to about the middle of the opening of the vagina. These arc the NymphAi or Alje Moores.

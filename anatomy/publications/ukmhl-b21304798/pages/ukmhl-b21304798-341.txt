505 The coraco-brachialis is generally perforated by the external cutaneous nerve. The Brachialis Internus arises by two distinct tleshy portions from the middle of the os humeri, on each side of the insertion of the deltoid which occu- pies the space between them; its fibres thence de- scend, having attachments in their course to the front and sides of the bone, and to the intermuscular ligament on each side. At the lower part of the arm, the fibres converge, and pass over the front of the elbow-joint where they adhere to the capsule, and then terminate by a tendinous insertion into a rough surface of the ulna at the Toot of its coronoid pro- cess. The insertion of this muscle will be seen in the dissection of the forearm. The Triceps Extensor Cueiti is divided above, into three distinct heads. The first, or long head, arises by a broad tendon from the inferior costa of the scapula, near its neck, and thence' proceeds between the teres major and mmor, strait down the arm. The second head begins in a pointed form at the upper part of the os humeri, just below the insertion of the teres minor; and thence continues its origin down- wards, from the ridge which extends along the out- side of the bone to the external condyle. The third head, called Brachialis Externus, arises in a pointed form from the os humeri, just below the in- sertions of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and thence continues its origin downwards from the ridge which extends along the inside of the bone to the

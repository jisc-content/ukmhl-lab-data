248 \ conjunctiva, open externally by perforating the latter towards the temporal side of the eye, and near the ciliary edge of the upper lid. The PuNCTA Lacrymalia are two small orifices placed at the edges of the eye-lids, just within their ciliary margins, and towards the inner corner of the eye. The two openings are opposite to each other, so that they meet when the eye is shut. Each punctum is situated upon an eminence, or project- ing papilla. From the puncta lacrymalia, two small Ducts are continued through the eye-lids, to terminate in the lacrymal sac. The duct, proceeding from the punc- tum in the upper lid, fir.st ascends a little, and then turning inwards at an acute angle, passes obliquely downwards. The duct in the lower lid, first de- scends, and then turning inwards at an acute angle, proceeds obliquely upwards. In the latter part of their course, the two ducts follow the direction of the edges of the lids, and are placed near their internal surfaces. They gradually approach each other, and unite at the inner angle of the eye into a common duct, which proceeds transversely behind the tendon of' the orbicularis palpebrarum into the lacrymal sac at its superior and external part. Sometimes the two ducts are notâ€™ joined, but proceed separately and terminate in the sac by dis- tinct orifices. The Lacrymal Sac is lodged in the groove w O

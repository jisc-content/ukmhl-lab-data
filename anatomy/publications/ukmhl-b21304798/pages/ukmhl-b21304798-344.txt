308 lower part of the forearm, it is connected in front with the Anterior Annular Ligament; and behind, it forms a thick band, which is attached to the back parts of the radius and ulna, and extends across the carpus, binding down the tendons of the supinator and extensor muscles in their passage from Jthe fore- arm to the hand. This band is denominated the Fosteeior Anijular Ligament, or Liga- MENTUM Carpi Transversals Externum. Upon the removal of the fascia from the front of the forearm, the attention of the student will be first directed to a hollow immediately below the elbow-joint. This hollow is bounded on each side by two thick masses of muscles. The mass on the ulnar side is formed by the Flexors and Pronators â– which are attached to the inner condyle. The mass on the radial side is formed by the Supinators and Extensors, which are attached to the outer con- dyle. The hollow itself is occupied by the principal vessels and nerves. The Flexor and Pronator muscles form altogether but one mass of flesh, attached by a common tendon to the inner condyle, to the olecranon and to the ulna, along two-thirds of its length. This mass soon di- vides into the several muscles which we may arrange in the following order, beginning from the hollow in which the vessels arc found, and thence proceeding to the ulnar side of the forearm. The Pronator Radii Teres. The Flexor Carpi Radialis.

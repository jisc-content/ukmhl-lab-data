80 ureter passes obliquely for some distance between the muscular and mucous coats, before it perfo- rates the latter, and enters into the cavity of the bladder. The Prostate Gland is placed in front of the neck of the bladder. It is a whitish body, chesnut shaped, and of a dense unyielding texture. Its broadest part is turned backwards, where it is firmly united to the neck of the bladder by cellular tissue. The prostate is separated above, from the symphysis pubis by a space of about half an inch, and below, it is united to the rectum by a dense cellular tissue. In the dissection of the prostate, many large veins are seen placed closely ai-ound the broad part of the gland and the neck of the bladder. The Urethra is a canal about nine inches in length, extending from the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the penis. It is lined throughout by a coniinuous membrane, and exteriorly, its sides are formed by parts of a different structure in different situations. From the neck of the bladder, the urethra passes through the prostate gland, rather ob- liquely from above downwards, and nearer to its upper than to its under surface, hence a larger share of the prostate is below and at the sides of the canal than above it. The urethra leaves the prostate at its upper and front part, and continues its course forwards beneath the arch of the pubes, in a direc- tion slightly curved upwards. From beneath the arch, the urethra ascends in front of the ossa pubis, and

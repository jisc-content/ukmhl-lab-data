238 (b) Transversalis Faciei, which is usually a large artery. It passes across the masseter muscle into the face in the same direction with the parotid duct, and divides into several branches which are distributed to the side of the face, and communicate, with the branches of the Infra-orbitary and Facial Arteries. The Temporal Artery divides at its termination into an anterior and a posterior branch, the one distri- butes its ramifications backwards upon the occiput, where they communicate with the Occipital and Posterior Auricular Arteries, the other distributes its ramifications forwards upon the forehead, where they communicate with branches of the Ophthalmic Artery which are reflected from the orbit upwards upon the frontal bone. The Internal Maxillary Artery proceeds from its origin in a very tortuous course upwards and inwards behind the superior maxillary bone, towards the fissure between the superior maxillary and the sphenoid bones at the lower and back part of the orbit. In this course it gives off the following branches, (a) Arteria Meningea Media, a large branch which ascends directly upwards to the foramen spi- nosum, through which it is continued into the skull. Within the skull, it ascends obliquely forwards on the inside of the temporal and sphenoid bones, to the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, where it is lodged either in a deep groove, or in a complete I

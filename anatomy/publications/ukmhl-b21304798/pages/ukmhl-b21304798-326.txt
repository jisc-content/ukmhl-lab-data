290 and sixth vertebrse of the neck, and ascending ob- liquely inwards upon the bodies of the vertebrse, covers the outer edge of the longus colli, and is in- serted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, close to the foramen magnum. Beneath, and a little to the outside of the prci- ceding, is The Rectus Internus AIinor, which arises from the root of the transverse process of the atlas, and ascending obliquely inwards, is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, immediately in front of the condyle on the same side. A small muscle is extended between the trans- verse process of the atlas and the occiput, which is The Rectus Lateralis ; arising from the front of the transverse process of the atlas, it ascends, and. is inserted into a depression of the occiput between the condyle and mastoid process. %

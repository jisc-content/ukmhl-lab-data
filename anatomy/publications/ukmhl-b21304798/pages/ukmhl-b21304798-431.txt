S95 ihe appearance denominated Arbor Vit^e. These strata diverge towards the circumference of the cere- bellum, and are covered externally by grey sub- stance. The next object for examination in the basis, is the Tuber Annulare, or Pons Varolii. This is a very considerable eminence placed in front of the cerebellum. In its natural situation, it rests upon the basilar process of the occipital bone. Its ex- ternal surface is convex, and is divided into two lateral halves by a middle groove in which the basilar artery is lodged. The Tuber Annulare is joined to the cerebrum, by two thick white cords, named the Crura Cerebri, and to the cerebellum, by two similar cords, named the Crura Cerebelli. The crura cerebri arise from each front angle of the tuber, and are continued outwards and forwards to the under part and middle of each hemisphere of the cerebrum in which they terminate. The crura cerebelli arise from each pos- terior angle, and side of the tuber, and are continued outwards and backwards into the hemispheres of the cerebellum. When a transverse section is made of either crus cerebri, a stratum of dark coloured sub- stance is seen extending across the divided surface. This is named the Locus Niger. Of the Medulla Oblongata. The Medulla Oblongata is that portion of the brain which inter- venes between the tuber annulare and the foramen magnum. It is broadest above, where it is separated s 6

78 in the removal of the os innominatum. The levator ani is to be reflected downwards, by separating it from the fibres of the sphincter ani, with which it is con- nected, and is to be left attached to the back part of the rectum. The muscular fibres of the rectum, which are arranged longitudinally in respect to the intestine, and the muscular fibres of the bladder, which cross each other in various directions arc then to be cleaned, the dissection of both organs being confined to that side which is exposed to view. The ureter, and vas deferens, will be seen at the side of the bladder, and one of the vesicula2 serainales will be brought into view by cautiously dissecting through the cellular tissue, between the lower part of the bladder and the rectum, and the prostate gland will be seen attached to the lower and front part of the bladder. The urethra is afterwards to be carefully exposed in its whole course from the prostate gland, beneath the arch of the pubes, and along the corpus spongiosum : the fibres of the acce- lerarores urince muscles having been previously re- flected from the latter jiart. The Bladder is placed in the hypogastric region, and immediately behind the ossa pubis, the extent of the space which it occupies necessarily varying with ihe quantity of its contents. In its contracted state, the bladder is found deep in the pelvis below the ossa pubis, and presenting a triangular and somewhat flattened figure, with its broadest part extended trans- versely across the cavity. Tn its distended state, the

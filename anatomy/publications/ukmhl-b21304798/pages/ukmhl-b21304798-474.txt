458 glands are found within the folds of the mucou* membrane, which will be presently described as passing between the sides of the epiglottis and tho arytenoid cartilages. The Larynx is lined throughout by a mucous membrane, which is continuous above, with the mu- cous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and below, with the mucous lining of the trachea. When w’c look into the Larynx from its upper '■jjart, we see its superior opening, by which it commu- nicates with the Pharynx, and this opening is de- nominated, although improperly, the Glottis, or lliM.v Glot-tidis. It is of a triangular form, w'ith its broadest part turned forwards. In front, it is bounded by the epiglottis, behind, by the arytocnoid cartilages, and at the sides, by two horizontal folds of the mucous membrane, which are extended be- tween the lateral edges of the epiglottis and the ary- taenoid cartilages. At about half an inch below the superior opening of the larynx, we see two other horizontal folds of the mucous membrane, within which are placed the Ligaments of the Glottis, or CiiouDyE VocALES. These ligaments arc imme- diately exposed by the reflection of the mucous mem- brane covering them. They arise from the front parts of the bases of the aryteenoid cartilages, and thence proceeding forwards and inwards, are inserted close together into the angle of the thyroid cartilage. The intcn al between them has a slit-like appearance.

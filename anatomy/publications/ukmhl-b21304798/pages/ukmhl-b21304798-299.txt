263 XheCoNSTRiCTOR IsTHMi Faucium, or Palato- glossus muscle. It arises from the side of the tongue at its base, and ascending within the fold of the mucous membrane forming the anterior half arch of the palate, terminates in the middle of the velum palati. By the reflection of the mucous membrane of the Â« posterior half arch of the palate, muscular fibres are discovered, which form \ The Palato-Pharyngeus muscle. This arises from the side of the pharynx, where its fibres are in- termixed with those of the constrictor medius and stylo-pharyngeus, and from the thyroid cartilage. It ascends wdthin the posterior half arch of the pa- late, and then becoming broader, is inserted into the middle of the velum palati, where it is connected with the tendons of the circumflexi palati muscles. By removing the mucous membrane from the posterior surface of the velum palati at its middle and from the uvula, a distinct muscle is brought into view, which is, The Azygos UvuL/E. It arises from the pointed projection at the back part of the ossa palati, where the two bones are united, and proceeds along the middle of the velum into the uvula. By dissecting through the mucous membrane, at the upper part and side ot the pharynx, another muscle of the palate is brought into view, situated at the side of the posterior opening of the nose. It is denominated.

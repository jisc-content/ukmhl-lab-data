195 K 2 The vertebral artery gives off in the neck, (a) Branches to the deep-seated muscles, and to the membranes of the medulla spinalis. Some of these communicate with the branches of the oc- cipital. (b) Posterior Meningeal Arteries ramifying upon the dura mater at the back part of the skull. A large vein accompanies the vertebral artery in its course through the holes in the transverse processes of the vertebrae. The vertebral artery occasionally arises as a dis- tinct branch from the arch of the aorta. The distribution of the vertebral artery within the cranium will be described with the arteries of the brain. 5. The Cervicalis Profunda, or Posterior, which usually arises from the subclavian just before it passes beneath the scalenus anticus. It ascends obliquely backwards, and ends in branches which distribute themselves to the muscles covering the pos- terior part of the spine, and communicate above with the branches of the occipital. 6. The Cervicalis Superficialis, or, Ante- rior, which arises from the upper part of the sub- clavian after it has passed beneath the scalenus anti- cus. At its origin, it is concealed by the nerves of the axillary plexus. It proceeds transversely across the neck to the superior costa of the scapula, where it ends in branches to the surrounding mus- cles.

211 course downwards to the extent of two inches within the bag, it opens into the Right Auricle of the heart, at its upper and outer part. Before the vena cava superior receives the re- flection of the pericardium, many small veins open into it from the surrounding parts, and one of larger size, which is the Vena Azygos. The Vena Cava Inferior, immediately after it has entered the chest, by passing through the hole in the central tendon of the diaphragm, receives the re- flection of the pericardium, and opens into the right auricle of the heart at its lower and outer part. The termination of the vein may be readily seen by raising the point of the heart, and then looking within the bag of the pericardium towards its back part and right side. The course of the first portion of the aorta, and the branches which are sent off from it are now to be ex- amined. The Aorta arises from the upper and back part of the left ventricle of the heart, and is placed at its commencement opposite to the lower margin of the cartilage of the third rib on the right side. From its origin it ascends behind the pulmonary artery, and inclines a little to the right. When it reaches as high as to be opposite to the lower margin of the first rib, it bends obliquely backwards to the left side of the third dorsal vertebra. All this part of the aorta is denominated its Transverse Arch, or. Curva- ture. The arch of the aorta is separated in front,

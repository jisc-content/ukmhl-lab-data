92 cavity of the pelvis, and separating it into an anterior division, containing the bladder, and a pos- terior division, the rectum. Anterior and I^osterior Ligaments of the Uterus are sometimes described. The former con- sist of two small folds formed by the peritoneum as it is reflected from the back of the bladder to the front of the uterus, and the latter, of two similar folds, sometimes but indistinctly seen, between the vagina and rectum, on each side of the peritoneal pouch. The Uterus is placed rather obliquely in the pel- vis between the bladder and the rectum, its superior broadest part or fundus having an inclination back- wards, and its lower contracted part or cervix having an inclination forwards. The figure of the uterus is triangular with its greatest breadth in the transverse direction. Its anterior and posterior surfaces are convex. That part of the organ which is between the fundus and cervix is denominated its body. The lower end of the cervix uteri is united to the vagina, and has an oval opening, the longest diameter of which is in the transverse direction. This opening is named either the Os Uteri, Os Internum, or Os Tinc^e. The uterus is fixed in its situation by the broad liga- ments connecting its sides with the walls of the pelvis. The appendages of the uterus consist of the Fallo- pian Tubes, the Ovaries with their Ligaments, and the Round Ligaments. All these parts are contained with the vessels and nerves of the uterus between the layers of the Broad Ligaments.

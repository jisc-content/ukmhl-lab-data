229 the eye the upper and lower fibres of the muscle meet, and are continued into each other. The or- bicularis palpebrarum is connected above with the occipito-frontalis, and w'ith the corrugator supercilii muscles. Some fibres are generally observed to de- tach themselves from the lower part of the orbicu- laris ; and proceeding downwards, they terminate in the fat of the cheek, or become connected with some of the adjacent muscles. That part of the orbicularis palpebrarum which covers the eyelids, is sometimes described as a dis- tinct muscle by the name of Ciliaris. The fibres of the occipito-frontalis, which are ex- tended downwards towards the upper and inner cor- ner of the eye, are now to be carefully separated from the orbicularis palpebrarum, and reflected up- wards, when a small muscle will be brought into view, which is The Corrugator Supercilii. It arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, and proceeding obliquely upwards and outwards, termi- nates above the middle of the orbit by being inter- mixed with the fibres of the occipito-frontalis and or- bicularis palpebrarum muscles. A very small muscle is situated upon the ala nasi, which is The Compressor Narium. It arises from the side of the ala nasi, close to its connexion with the superior maxillary bone, and proceeds across the ala to the dorsum nasi. Some of its fibres are con-

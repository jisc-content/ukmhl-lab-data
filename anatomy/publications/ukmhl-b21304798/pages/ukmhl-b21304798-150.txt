114 The Anterior Crural Nerve passing beneath Poupartâ€™s ligament into the thigh, soon divides into branches which may be distinguished into two sets, the superficial or cutaneous, and the deep-seated or muscular. The cutaneous branches varying from two to six, pass through the aporturea of the fascia, and ramify upon it. The muscular branches are variable in number, and are distributed to the muscles occupying the front and inside of the thigh. One of these smaller than the rest descends imme- diately in front of the femoral artery as far as the knee. Two larger branches pass downwards close to the outer side of the artery; of these, one pene- trates the vastus internus, the other, denominated the Nervus Saphenus, continuing its course down- wards, enters the tendinous sheath in front of the artery. I'hen passing out of the shfeath at its lower end, the nerve appears superficially on the inside of the thigh, a little above the knee. The dissection of the vessels and nerves being thus complet'd, the student must, in the next place, separate the muscles throughout their course, in order that a distinct view may be gained of their origins and insertions.

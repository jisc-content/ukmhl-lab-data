187 it. The skin covering the mammary gland is re- markable for its softness and delicacy of texture, and nearly in its centre is the nipple, surrounded by a circle of a deeper colour termed the areola. At the extremity of the nipple, numerous orifices may be distinguished. These are the terminations of the lactiferous ducts which arise in the substance of the gland. In the male subject the mammary gland bears no comparison in its size with that w hich is found in the female. When the integuments which cover the whole front and side of the chest are removed, we expose The Pectoralis Major. This is abroad and tri- angular muscle, divided into a superior portion, which arises by short aponeurotic fibres from the inner half of the clavicle, and into an infeiior portion, which arises by aponeurotic fibres from the whole front surface i of the sternum, and by fleshy fibres from the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and sometimes of the seventh ribs. From these origins the fibres proceed in an oblique direction across the chest, and con- verge towards the inside of the arm, where they ter- minate in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the os humeri, along the front margin of the bicipital groove. The steraal and clavicular portions of the muscle are separated by a distinct line, occupied only by cellular tissue, and between the clavicular portion and the front edge of the deltoid there is an interspace occupied by fat and cellular tissue, and by

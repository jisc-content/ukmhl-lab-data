1 R 2 S63 ARTICULATION OF THE FEMUR WITH THE OS INNOMINATUM. The Capsule of the hip joint is the thickest and strongest in the body. It is formed like the capsule of the shoulder joint, by the union of a fibrous with a synovial membrane. The fibrous membrane is at- tached above, to the circumference of the acetabulum, and descending to the basis, or lowest part of the neck of the femur, is fixed to the root of the tro- * chanter major, and to the oblique line extended be- tween the two trochanters in front; and, lastly, to the posterior part of the root of the neck, just above the oblique line extended between the two trochanters be- hind. When the joint is opened, the synovial mem- brane is seen to be reflected from the inside of the fibrous membrane upon the periosteum of the neck, and upon the cartilaginous surface of the head of the femur. From the head of the femur, it is icflectcd around the interarticular ligament, or ligamentum teres, and is then continued upon the cartilaginous surface of the acetabulum. The capsule of the hip is not of the same thick- ness throughout. It is thick in its external part, and especially so in front, where it is strengthened by a thick band of fibres, descending from the anterior inferior spine, and front margin of the ilium. The capsule is so much thinner in its inner part, as to be much weaker here than in the situations just mentioned.

7* 4 right and left side, in which the testicles are sus- pended by the spermatic cords. Numerous vessels and nerves ramify in the cellular tissue of the scrotum. The arteries are principally derived from the sperraatics and external pudics, and the nerves are branches of the lumbar nerves which have de- scended from the abdomen through the abdominal ring. The Testicle and its Spermatic Cord are closely enveloped by a sheath of condensed cellular tissue, which is denominated the Tunica Vaginalis of the Cord, and is to be distinguished from the serous membrane of the testicle presently to be described, which is the Tunica Vaginalis Testis. The cellular sheath of the cord is connected externally with the fibres of the cremaster muscle, and with the general cellular tissue of the scrotum, and internally with the speimatic vessels and nerves, and at its lower part is spread upon the tunica vaginalis testis. Besides the cremaster muscle and the cellular sheath just mentioned, the spermatic cord is com- posed of the following parts connected by cellular tissue, viz., the Spermatic Artery, which is very tor- tuous in its course ; the Spermatic Veins, which form, by their ramifications, a plexus, denominated the Corpus Pampinieorme ; the Spermatic Nerves; and numerous Absorbent Vessels, which passing through the ring into the abdomen terminate in the lumbar glands; and lastly, the Vas Deferens, which in its ascent from the testicle to the abdominal ring

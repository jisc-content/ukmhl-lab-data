409 process, and then divides into two branches, one named Petrosal, or Cranial, and the,other Carotid. The cranial branch passes into the skull through the irregular aperture between the side of the sphenoid and the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Then ascending to the upper border of the latter, it enters a peculiar canal in the bone, and terminates by joining the facial nerve in the aquaeductus Fallopii. The carotid branch enters the canalis carotideus with the carotid artery, and terminates by joining the filaments of communication between the superior cervical gan- glion of the Sympathetic and the abductor nerve. Besides these branches proceeding from the spheno- palatine ganglion, there arise from the superior maxillary nerve, two or three dental nerves, which enter canals in the superior maxillary bone for the supply of the teeth. The distribution of the superior maxillary nerve, after it has emerged from the infra-orbitary foramen, is described in the dissection of the face. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve, forming the third division of the fifth pair, proceeds Irom the Ganglion Gasserianum, almost perpendicularly down- wards to the foramen ovale, through which it leaves the skull. After its passage through the foramen, the nerve is placed between the zygomatic fossa, and pterygoideus externus muscle, and here divides into a superior and inferior portion. 'From the superior portion proceed the Temporal, IMasseteric, Buccal, and Pterygoid Nerves. From theinfe- T

219 L 2 terior and posterior pulmonary plexuses. The branches of these plexuses accompany the rami- fications of the bronchi through the lungs, and appear to be distributed almost entirely to the mucous mem- brane lining the air tubes. 3. The (Esophageal Nerves. Each par vagum divides upon the oesophagus into several branches which communicate and divide again, so as to form a plexus in front and behind the tube. These oeso- phageal plexuses communicate freely, and distribute their filaments to the coats of the oesophagus and to the aorta. Towards the lower part of the chest the branches of each plexus unite again into a single nerve which accompanies-the oesophagus into the abdomen, the right nerve being still behind the tube, and the left in front of it. The final distribution of the par vagum in the ab- domen will be described with the ganglia and plexuses of the abdominal viscera. The Vena Azygos entering the chest either through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, or through a distinct opening in the lesser muscle, ascends in a strait course upon the right side of the spine to about the fourth dorsal vertebra, where it bends forwards to terminate in the posterior part of the vena cava superior in the situation already men- tioned. The branches which the vena azygos receive in its course through the chest arc l.The Right Intercostal Veins corresponding to tire intercostal arteries given off by the aorta. The

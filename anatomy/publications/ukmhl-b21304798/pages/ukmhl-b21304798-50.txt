14 tached below, to the whole length of Poupartâ€™s liga- ment, and being traced upwards, is found to divide immediately above the middle of the ligament into two portions, between which a considerable interval is left for the passage of the spermatic vessels and vas deferens out of the abdomen. Both portions of the fascia become gradually thinner as they ascend, until they are lost in the cellular tissue between the transversalis muscle and peritoneum. On its inner margin the fascia is connected to the outer edge of the rectus, and to the lower part of the conjoined- tendon, belonging to the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles. The course of the spermatic cord must, in the next place, be examined. It has been already men- tioned that the spermatic vessels and vas deferens, which are the principal parts of the cord, pass through the interval left between the two portions of the fascia transversalis. The lower and lateral boun- daries of the opening through which the cord leaves the abdomen, are formed by the margins of the fascia, while the upper boundary is formed by the lower margin of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, which here cross over the spermatic cord, as will be seen by replacing them in their natural situation. From the interval in the fascia transversalis, the spermatic cord proceeds obliqutly downwards, and inwards beneath the aponeurosis of the external ob- lique to the ring, receiving in this part of its course *

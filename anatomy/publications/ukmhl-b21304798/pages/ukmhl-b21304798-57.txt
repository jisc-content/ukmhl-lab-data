21 where it is continued into the fissure dividing the liver into its right and left lobes, and is thence continued backwards, gradually contracting its breadth as it approaches to the back part of the organ. Between- the two peritoneal layers of the ligamentum latum, we feel in front a round cord, denominated the Liga- mentum Teres, and formed by the remains of the umbilical vein, which belongs to the fo?tal circulation. When the ligamentum latum reaches the convex surface of the liver, its two layers separate, and are continued over the liver, one upon its right, the other upon its left lobe. The membrane is then continued around the edges, and upon the whole under surface of the organ. In this way the liver possesses a com- plete covering of peritoneum, which adheres very closely to its substance. Between the right and left lobes of the liver and the diaphragm, there are two small folds of peritoneum, denominated the Right and Left Lateral Li- gaments of the liver. The left is generally more distinct than the right. The posterior part of the liver adheres closely to the diaphragm [by cellular tissue over a surface of considerable extent. The peritoneum forming the boundaries of this adhesion is denominated the Coronary Ligament of the liver. In the under part of the right lobe of the liver, there is an excavation in which the gall bladder is lodged. The Gall bladder is a small bag of a pyri-

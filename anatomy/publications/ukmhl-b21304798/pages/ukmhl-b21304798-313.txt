rical and of all the dorsal vertebra?. Its upper fibres descend obliquely outwards, its middle fibres pro- ceed horizontally, and its lower fibres ascend obli- quely. All of them converge towards the shoulder, and are inserted into the posterior border of the cla- vicle, along a third part of the bone at its humeral end, into the posterior edge of the acromion, and into the whole upper border of the spine of the scapula by an aponeurosis which slides over the triangulaiâ€™ flattened surface at the commencement of the spine towards the basis. The Latissimus Dorsi is a broad and flattened muscle situated upon the lower part of the back and upon the loins, and thence extending outwards to the arm. It arises by a broad and strong aponeurosis, and by distinct fleshy digitations. The aponeurosis is fixed to the spinous processes, of the six lower dorsal, and of all the lumbar vertebra, to the pos- terior part of the sacrum, and to the crista ilii, along its posterior third. The fleshy digitations are fixed to the external surfaces of the three lowermost ribs, and are received between the corresjtonding digitations of the external oblique muscle. 'I'hc lower fibres of the latissimus dorsi ascend obliquely, and the upper fibres proceed transversely, all of them converging towards the posterior inferior angle of the scapula, over which they pass, and then continue their course t)bliquely upwards and outwards over the teres major to the arm. As the latissimus dorsi approaches

133 the flexor muscles, and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve pass beneath this ligament in their course from the leg into the sole of the foot. In reflecting the fascia from the front of'the leg, it is found so firmly adherent to the muscles at the upper part, that their surfaces are necessarily left rough cind irregular. Processes of the fascia are also remarked entering between the muscles, separating them and giving attachments to their fibres. Upon the removal of the fascia, three muscles arc brought into view in the front of the leg, between the tibia and fibula, and two along the outer side of the fibula. The three in front and between the tibia and fibula, consist of The Tibialis Anticus, placed close to the tibia. The Extensor Longus Digitorum Pedis, si- tuated on the outer side of the tibialis anticus at its upper part. The Extensor Proprius Pollicis Pedis, si- tuated between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum at their lower part. The two muscles placed along the outer side of the fibula, are Tire Peroneus Longus, attached to the upper part of the fibula. The Peroneus Brevis, situated beneath the lower part of the peroneus longus. The Tibialis Anticus arises from the tuberosity and outer side of the tibia in the upper half of its ex- tent, and from the adjacent part of the interosseous liga-

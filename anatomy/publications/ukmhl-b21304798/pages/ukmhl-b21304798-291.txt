255 along which it is continued forwards to the nose. The ophthalmic artery gives off many branches which may be arranged in the following order: (a) Branches distributed to all the parts in the orbit j and to the eye-lids. (b) Branches which pass through the foramen, or- bitarium internum posterius, and arc distributed to the ethmoidal cells, and 'other parts of the nose. (c) Anterior Meningeal Arteries, which ! entering the skull, are distributed upon the front part of the dura mater, and communicate with the other i; meningeal arteries. (d) Supra-Orbitary Artery which passes 1 through the superciliary notch, and distributes its I ramifications to the muscles and integuments of the I forehead, where they communicate with branches of II the temporal artery. Another smaller branch of the ophthalmic is reflected ov.er the ridge of the orbit to 1' the forehead. (e) Centralis RETiNiE ; which enters the optic il nerve, and is continued forwards through it to the 1 retina. 1 '(f) Ciliary Arteries distributed to the globe I of the eye. They arc divided into three sets. I I 1. The Long Ciliary Arteries, two in num- || ber, which penetrate the sclerotica at about one-third tj of the distance between the optic nerve and the a cornea, and are distributed to the choroid coat as far y as the orbiculus ciliaris.

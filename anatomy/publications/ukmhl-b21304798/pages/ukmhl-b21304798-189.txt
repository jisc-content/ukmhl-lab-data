153 H 5 proceed obliquely forwards to the outer side of the foot, where they have a tendinous attachment to the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone of tlje little toe. The muscle is then continued forwards to be attached to the outside of the first phalanx of the same toe. The three muscles just described are to be de- tached from their origins, in order to bring the rest more completely into view. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis Pedis arises by a distinct broad tendon from the under part of the os calcis, and proceeds obliquely along the metatar- sal bone, gradually separating into two distinct por- tions, which are attached separately to the two sesa- moid bones, and to the first phalanx of the great toe. The tendon of the flexor longus is placed between the two portions of the flexor brevis. The Adductor Pollicis Pedis arises from the under part of the os cuboides, and from the liga- ments connecting the metatarsal bones. It proceeds obliquely forwards by the side of the flexor brevis, to be attached to the external sesamoid bone, and to the tarsal end of the first phalanx of the great toe. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti Pedis arises from the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and proceeds directly forwards to be at- tached to its first phalanx.

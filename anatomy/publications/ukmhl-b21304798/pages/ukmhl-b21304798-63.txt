27 c 2 the jejunum usually have a red colour, and are thicker to the feel than the coats of the ilium, which arc pale and usually so thin as to be almost transpa- rent*. These differences become apparent only by a comparative examination of a portion of jejunum near its commencement, and a portion of ilium near its termination; for as the jejunum and ilium ap- proach each other, their characters change insen- sibly, until the distinctions between them are alto- gether lost. The termination of the ilium will be found in the right iliac region, where it opens ob- liquely into the left side of the first portion of the large intestine which is the Ccecum. The jejunum and ilium are connected with the back part of the abdomen by a broad fold of peritoneum, denominated the Mesentery. It consists of two peritoneal layers which are extended from the left lumbar region obliquely downwards to the ter- mination of the small intestine in the right iliac region. In its course downwards, the mesentery ex- pands itself sufficiently in breadth to be attached to the whole length of the jejunum and ilium, and both portions of intestine < are received between its layers so as to give them a complete peritoneal covering. Between the layers of the mesentery lie imbedded the * These distinctions arise from the folds formed by the mucous membrane of the intestines, constituting the val- vulae conniventes, which are larger and more numerous in the jejunum than in the ilium.

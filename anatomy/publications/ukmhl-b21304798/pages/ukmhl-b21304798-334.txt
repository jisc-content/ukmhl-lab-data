298 The Ikternal Cutaneous Nerve proceeds from the plexus, directly down the inside of the arm, beneath the fascia, and immediately in front of the basilic vein. Towards the lower part of the arm it divides into filaments, which penetrate the fascia, and pass in front, and on the inside of the elbow joint into the forearm. The filaments may be here traced distributing themselves superficially between the skin and fascia along the front, inner side, and back of ^the forearm, extending to the wrist and back of the hand, and communicating with the filaments of the external cutaneous nerve. A third cutaneous nerve is sometimes described by the name of Cutaneus Minor, or Nerve of Wrisberg. It is a small branch which arises in the axilla, and thence descending along the arm, is distributed to the integuments covering the triceps muscle. The Median Nerve proceeds from the plexus downwardsij along the inner edge of the biceps muscle. In the upper part of its course the nerve > is placed in front of the brachial artery, but as it de- scends passes to its inner side. From the lower part of the arm the median nerve is continued forwards with the brachial artery to the front of the elbow joint. It does not give off any branches in its course down the arm. The Muscular Spiral, or Radial Nerve descends from the plexus oSliquely backwards, along the inside of the arm, concealed by the other nerves. t

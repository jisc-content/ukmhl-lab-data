416 spinal cord, which arc divided into the Cervical, Dorsal, Lumbar, and Sacral Nerves. The Cervical Nerves are eight on each side. 'I'he lirst of these passes out of the spine between the occiput and the atlas, the last between the seventh cervical and the first dorsal vertebra. The Dorsal Nerves are twelve on each side. The first passes out of the spine beneath the first rib, the last beneath the twelfth rib. The Lumbar Nerves are five on each side. The first passes out of the spine between the first and second lumbar vertebree, the last between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. The Sacral Nerves arc five on each side. The first passes outwards through the uppermost hole in the sacrum, the last between the sacrum and coccyx. Each of the spinal nerves arises by two series of filaments, one from the anterior, the other from the posterior surface of the cord. The anterior and pos- terior filaments proceed outwards from their origins, and arc at first separated by the ligamentum denticu- latum. Continuing their course outwards, they gra- dually approach each other and unite into two fasci- culi, which pass through separate openings of the dura mater. After their passage through the dura mater, the fasciculus formed of the posterior filaments swells into a small ganglion, to which the anterior fasciculus is united by cellular tissue. The two fasciculi then join into a single cord, which is the proper spinal nerve. The three lower lumbar nerves, with the whole of

213 vertebrse, hence its origin is somewhat concealed from being placed deeply in the chest. It ascends directly upwards into the neck, and then turns sud- denly outwards into the space between the scalenus anticus and medius muscles. There are several varieties both in the number and in the mode of origin of the branches given off from the arch of the aorta. The vertebral artery occasionally arises as a distinct branch from the arch. The right subclavian and right carotid arteries sometimes arise separately from the arch without the formation of an arteria innominata. In a few instances, two branches only have been seen arising from the arch, one of them dividing into the right subclavian and right carotid, the other into the left carotid and left subclavian. The right sub- clavian artery has been seen arising separately from the arch near its termination, and thence proceeding transversely either between the trachea and oesophagus, or between the oesophagus and spine, to the right side of the neck. The course of the phrenic nerve through the cheft is next to be examined. The Phrenic Nerve passing from the neck into the chest between the subclavian artery and vein, proceeds downwards in front of the pulmonary ves- sels, and on the outside of the pleura to the lateral part of the pericardium, along which it is con- tinued to the diaphragm. It gives off no branches in its course through the chest until it reaches the

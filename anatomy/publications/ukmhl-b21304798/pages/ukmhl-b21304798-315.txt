^79 and proceeding obliquely downwards and outwards, is inserted into the basis of the scapula, between the spine and the inferior angle. The Rhomboideus Minor arises from the liga- mentum nuchse, and from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra, and descending obliquely out- wards, is inserted into the basis of the scapula, opposite to the triangular surface at the commence- ment of the spine. The rhomboid muscles are to be reflected from the spine, and beneath them is seen The Serratus Posticus Superior, which arises by a thin aponeurosis from the lower part of the liga mentum nuchge, and from the spinous processes ot the two or three first dorsal vertebra?. It proceeds obliquely downwards, and is inserted by distinct fleshy slips into the posterior parts of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. The Serratus Posticus Inferior is placed beneath that part of the latissimus dorsi, which is ex- tended over the four last ribs. It arises from the spinous processes of the two last dorsal and of the three first lumbar vertebrae, by a broad aponeurosis which, as already mentioned, is very closely united with the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. It proceeds outwards, and divides into four distinct fleshy portions which are inserted into the lower edges of the four last ribs. The two preceding muscles are to be reflected from the spine, and left attached to the ribs. /

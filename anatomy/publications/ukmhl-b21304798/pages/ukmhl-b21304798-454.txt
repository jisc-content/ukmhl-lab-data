I he Sacral Nerves divide within the canal of the sacrum into anterior and posterior branches. The Anterior branches pass out of the anterior sacral fora- mina. The anterior branches of the four first sacral nerves communicate with the sacral ganglia of the Sympathetic, and unite into the sacral plexus. The anterior branch of the fifth sacral nerve is distri- buted to the levator and sphincter ani, and coccy- gcus muscles. The postei'ior branches pass out of the posterior sacral foramina, and are distributed to the muscles covering the back part of the sacrum, and to the muscles and integuments of tlie buttock.

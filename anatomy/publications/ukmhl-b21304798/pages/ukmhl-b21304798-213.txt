177 which communicate with the other arteries of the face. {b) Numerous small branches also arise from the external maxillary for the supply of the submaxillary ffland. ' / 4. The Ascending Pharyngeal, which is the smallest branch of the external carotid, arises from the back part of the trunk, and proceeds directly upwards to the basis of the skull, giving off in its course many branches to the surrounding parts. One branch of the ascending pharyngeal enters the skull through the foramen jugulare, and is distributed upon the dura mater. 5. The Occipital arises from the external carotid opposite to the lingual, and ascends obliquely back- wards behind the posterior portion of the digastricus, and in front of the internal jugular vein, to the space between the transverse process of the atlas and the mastoid process. It continues its course transversely outwards through a groove in the temporal bone, just below the fossa from which the posterior portion of the digastricus arises, and then passes beneath the splenius capitis muscle to the back of the neck, where it emerges by the side of the ligamentum nuchae. Here it becomes superficial and ascending upon the occiput, divides into several branches which are distributed upon the back jmrt and side of the head, where they communicate with the opposite I 5

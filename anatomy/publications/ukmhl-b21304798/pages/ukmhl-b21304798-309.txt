273 N 5 The tongue is formed throughout of muscular fibres, covered by mucous membrane. The muscu- lar fibres consist partly of the insertions of the se- veral muscles just mentioned, which arc the stylo- glossi, hyo-glossi, genio-hyo-glossi, and partly of other fibres, which arise and terminate in the organ. Some of these run transversely, others obliquely, and two longitudinal fasciculi are distinguished by the name of The Lingualis muscle, which extends along the under part of the tongue, from the basis to the apex. These different sets of muscular fibres, which altogether make up the substance of the tongue, are so closely connected with each other, and with the vessels and nerves of the organ, that it is very difficult to ascertain their arrangement. The Pharynx is a large bag, extending from the basis of the skull downwar4s in the neck, as low as the commencement of the trachea, where it termi- nates, by contracting into the oesophagus. The breadth of the pharyn.x corresponds at its upper part to the space between the pterygoid processes, and towards its lower part its breadth gradually di- minishes, so as to present in this situation a funnel- shaped appearance. ' The pharynx is attached above, to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and to the body of the sphenoid bone, by a dense fibrous substance ; and behind, to the laodies of the vertebrm by loose cellular tissue. On each side it is attached to the several parts from which thÂ«

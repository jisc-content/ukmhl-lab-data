158 more particularly with the depressor labii inferioris and the depressor anguli oris. In muscular subjects, the platisina niyoides is formed throughout of one stratum of fleshy fibres, closely connected by cellular tissue; but ip thin and extenuated subjects it is composed merely of pale and thin fibres, scattered irregularly over the side of the neck. I'he platisma myoides ia to be reflected from be- low upwards, when many filaments of nerves, de- rived from the second and third pairs of the cervical nerves will be seen ramitying beneath it. These fila- ments are distributed partly to the muscle itself, and partly to the integuments covering it. Immediately beneath the platisma myoides is The External Jugular Vein. This vein is formed above by several branches from the face, temple, and neck, which unite into one trunk near the upper part and front edge of the sterno-cleido- mastoidcus muscle. It proceeds obliquely down- wards betw'een the platisma and mastoid muscles, tothe'low'er part and posterior edge of the latter, whence it passes inw'ards behind the clavicle, and terminates in the subclavian vein more outwardly than the internal jugular. The external jugular fre- quently divides into two branches at the lower part of the neck, which have separate terminations in the subclavian vein. Many small veins Ifom the sur- rounding parts open into the e.xternal jugular vein. Several large veins are generally seen running

300 much cellular and adipose tissue. The artery and nerve lie close together, and the former is close to the inner side of the tendon of the biceps muscle. MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. It will now be corivenient to remove the upper ex- tremity, by dividing the muscles which connect the shoulder with the trunk, and when this is done, the student should review the attachments of these mus- cles to the scapula^, clavicle, and os humeri. He will then proceed to the dissection of the muscles of file shoulder, beginning with The Deltoid, which is a broad and thick mus- cle, extending from the shoulder downwards to the middle and external side of the humerus. It arises tendinous from the spine of the scapula in its whole length, from the front edge of the acromion, and from the front margin of the clavicle, along its outer third. From these origins, the muscle descends to the os humeri. Its anterior fibres have a direction obliquely backwards, its posterior fibres obliquely forwards, and its middle fibres perpendicularly, until they all converge into one tendon, which is inserted into the rough surface on the outside of the os humeri near its middle, and immediately above the origin of the brachialis internus. TJ^e fasciculi of this muscle are very large, and are sometimes separated by apo- neurotic fibres passing between them. Its posterior

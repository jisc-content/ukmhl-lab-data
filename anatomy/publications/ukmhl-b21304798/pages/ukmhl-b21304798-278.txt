242 others the Temporal Vein only is continued into the External Jugular, and the other Veins terminate in the Internal Jugular. OF THE NERVES. t The PoRTio Dura, or Facial Nerve, forming one of the divisions of the seventh pair of the cerebral nerves, passes out of the skull at the foramen stylo- mastoideum. It immediately enters the substance of rtic parotid, in which it is at first deeply buried. Thai proceeding obliquely downwards and forwards, it approaches nearer to the surface of the gland, and divides into two or three branches, which emerg- ing from beneath the front edge of the parotid, pass forwards upon the masseter muscle into the face. These branches split into numerous filaments which diverge overtheside of the face and temple, thus forming the distribution, denominated the Pcs Anserinus. The lowermost branch into which the portio dura divides passing forwards upon the masseter muscle, separates into filaments, some of which are distributed to the muscles and integuments of the lower lip, and others communicate with filaments of the upper cervical nerves. The InfrA'Orbitary Nerve, which is derived from the superior maxillary nerve, forming the second division of the fifth pair of the cerebral nerves, emerging upon the face from the infra-orbitary fora- men, immediately separates into many branches,

31 C 4 passed into the centre of the four layers, and insi- nuated to some distance between them. The length of the omentum varies much in different subjects, according to the extent to which the two peritoneal layers are continued downwards from the stomach before they are reflected to the colon. Thus, in some subjects, the tunentum reaches only to a short distance below the umbilicus, while in others, it ex- tends to the pelvis. The two reflected layers of the great omentum, reaching the transverse arch of the colon, separate and encircle the gut, and then meet again on its op- posite side so as to give to it a complete peritoneal covering. By their unâ€™on in this situation, they form a broad and h)Ose fold which extends from the trans- verse arch I of the colon to the back part of the ab- domen, and is denominated the Transverse Me- socolon. Between the layers of the transverse mesocolon lie imbedded the blood vessels and nerves of the intestine, the absorbents with their glands and connecting cellular tissue. When the transverse mesocolon reaches the back part of the abdomen, its two layers are disposed in the following manner. The superior layer turns up- wards in front of the duodenum and pancreas, and is then continued into the peritoneum investing the under surface of the liver. The inferior layer turns downwaids, and is continued into the upper or anterior layer of the mesentery. The refl< c(ion of the superior layer of the mesocolon upwards, in front

3 almost in the guide call for an answer at its proper place, which answer is easily remembered by one who has studied the organ two or three times with this severe system and training. In describing an organ we should give: ist. Definition of the organ, its synonymy and etymol- ogy ; 2d. Divide the organ into separate parts, if necessary; 3d. State the number; 4th. The dimen- sions; 5th. The situation ; 6th. The direction ; 7th. The means of fixity; 8th. The mobility; 9th. The shape; 10th. The surfaces, borders, angles, or extremities, as base and apex; nth.

To avoid repetition the definition should be based upon the function If the organ is a complex one, such as are sphe- noid and temporal bones, it is important to divide it into several parts, describing each part as a separate organ. In connection with the number, it should be stated whether the organ under description is single or double, and whether there are not sometimes supernumerary organs, such as the spleen, of which in some instances there may be one, two, or three supernumerary organs; also, whether in cases of double organs they are known to unite sometimes to form but one, such as is the case occasionally with the two kidneys, which unite by their extremi- ties to form the so-called “ horse-shoe kidney.” We must say, also, if the organ is ever known to be absent altogether. The dimensions should be described, either by comparing the organ to some familiarly

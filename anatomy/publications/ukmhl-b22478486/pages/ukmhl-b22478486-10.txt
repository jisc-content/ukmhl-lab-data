6 backward, and from above downward, and from within outward. In describing a groove we should say if it leads or not to a canal, its depth and the organs contained therein, artery, vein, nerve, or a mem- branous process, or a special organ. In mention- ing an orifice we should describe its size, shape, boundaries, structure, and contents. Finally, we should give the relations of the surface, which may be with skin (i. e., what part of the surface of the body its course corresponds to) ; or with bones, joints, muscles, viscera, vessels, nerves. The same course is to be followed in describing a border; first, give its other names; then its extent, then its shape; say if it is blunt or sharp, or bevelled at the expense of one surface or the other. All thick borders should be divided into two edges or lips, and an intermediate interstice, giving the peculiarities and relations of each, then its relative direction, whether vertical, horizontal, oblique, for- ward or backward, above or below, inward or out- ward ; afterward, its absolute direction, rectilinear or sinuous, concave or convex; next mention its peculiarities and its relations, following the same course as for a surface. The same course applies to the description of the angles of the organ, or to its extremities, or to the base and apex, if it should have any. It is now the time to describe the structure m This should always be preceded by men- tion of its color and its consistency, as these prop- erties are connected with the structure. In speak- ing of its consistency we must say whether the

4 known object or to some other organ of the human body (this is the relative dimension), or by actual measurement in inches or fractions (these are the absolute dimensions . When the organ is a hollow tube or a channel one should give the dimensions of its caliber or bore. The situation should be first stated in a general way, or in regard to the region it occupies; then its relative position should be mentioned, that is, the position it occupies in regard to the surrounding organs ; thus, for the spleen, we say it is situated in the left hypochrondrium, below the diaphragm, above the kidney, behind the stomach, etc. The direction piHMpt should be stated first as compared with the axis of the body, and then as compared with its own axis; thus, the fibula is ver- tically directed as compared with the axis of the body, and is twisted as regards its own axis. The means of fixity are either con- nections by adhesions through more or less loose or tough connective tissue, or ligaments formed of folds of the membranes enclosing them, or by vessels, or they are supported by organs situated beneath; thus, the liver has ligaments formed by the peritoneum; its upper border is closely adherent to the diaphragm by rather tough connective tissue, it is partially held in position by the hepatic veins passing from its substance to the ascending cava, and it is supported as on a soft cushion by the stomach and intestines. The mobility affects the whole organ or a part of it only; thus, the head and part of the body of the pancreas are firmly bound down,

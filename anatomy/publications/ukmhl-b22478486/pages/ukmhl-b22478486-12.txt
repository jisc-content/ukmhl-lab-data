8 The proper or characteristic elements! are either cells or fibers, tubes, or prisms, arranged in a peculiar manner according to the organ, to which are added capillary arteries, veins, and lym- phatics, and nervous filaments. The capillaries in many organs present a most interesting and often characteristic arrangement. If the organ described is a gland with an excretory duct, that duct should be described as a separate organ. If the organ is a hollow one, like the stomach or the heart, we should describe the interior with its lining mem- brane. We should mention with care the consist- ency of the membrane, its thickness, its elasticity, degree of adhesion of its deep surface, and in regard to its free surface, its color, its peculiarities, the nature of its epithelium, and, if any, the kind of glands which it contains. Some organs present a peculiarly interesting chemic composition which should be mentioned. Usually the point of interest lies in the relative amounts of the higher organic and the lesser organic elements. To be thorough the mode of development 4PPB should now be given, and the changes that it undergoes from its embryonic formation to the very oldest age. Finally, in a last paragraph, we should mention the peculiarities and varieties due to sex, habits, trades, constitutions, individualities, nationalities, and races. The same course is applicable to bones, ligaments, vessels, and nerves, although it may seem odd at first, since it is quite a departure from the old plan. It would be a waste of time before such an

5 whereas the tail is more or less movable. The organ may be movable by itself, as are the intestines, or its motion is communicated by another organ, such as the motion communicated from the diaphragm to the liver. Finally, it should be stated whether at times the mobility does not become excessive without interfering with the functions; thus, the kidney will sometimes escape more or less from its bed of areolar and adipose tissue, and, with- out impairing its usefulness, float about in the ab- domen. The shape SOfiBipt should be next consid- ered. It is very important to define it accurately, either by comparing it to a geometric figure, or by comparing it to the shape of a familiarly-known thing, because, according to its shape, an organ presents more or less surfaces, borders, angles, or extremities, or a base and an apex. In describing each surface we should mention the other names by which it is known, also its ex- tent, whether it is large or small; also its direction, whether it is directed forward or backward, above or below, or in an intermediate direction; also the form or shape of that surface, whether it is plane or concave or convex, either in the vertical or the horizontal direction, and if it is or is not the same all over the surface; also its peculiarities, which are represented either by projections (folds, processes, tubercles, protuberances, ridges, or crests) or by depressions (orifices, blind foramina, grooves, canals). When enumerating numerous peculiarities we should invariably begin on the median line and then on the sides, proceeding always from before *

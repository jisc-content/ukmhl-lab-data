7 organ is soft or hard, friable or not, elastic, dilatable, or retractile. As regards the structure we should first describe the envelops; a great many organs and most viscera are provided with a serous coat, reduced to its endothelial layer. Next comes a fibrous or fibro-elastic and muscular coat, bearing or not a special name or several names, varying in thickness and resistance, more or less elastic, pre- senting an external surface more or less elastic, and more or less closely connected with the surrounding tissues and organs; an internal surface more or less intimately connected with the proper tissue or sub- stance of the organ, and sending into this proper tissue filaments or processes that divide the interior fSinto a large number of alveoles, in which are deposited the proper or characteristic anatomic elements of the organ. Almost always the fibrous coat is reflected at the point called the hilum into the interior of the organ, and then divides into smaller and smaller processes, which join those given off from the inner surface, and assist in forming the alveoles. The whole of these processes and the alveoles which they form con- stitute what is called the stroma or fibrous skele- ton of the organ, which supports the more delicate elements of the proper substance. This stroma is more or less apparent, according to the organ; it is, like the fibrous coat, formed of more or less dense connective tissue, to which is often added elastic fibers and smooth muscular fibers in greater or lesser quantity. The proper substance of many organs is divided into an external or cortical sub- stance and into an internal or medullary.

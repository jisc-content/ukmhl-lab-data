[Reprinted from The Medical News, November 17, 1894.] A PLEA FOR A METH0DICALLY- WRITTEN TEXT- BOOK ON ANATOMY} By EDMOND SOUCHON, M.D., PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY AND CLINICAL SURGERY, TULANE UNIVERSITY, NEW ORLEANS, LA. It is my belief that students of anatomy would better learn and remember the innumerable and more or less complicated facts of anatomy if they had at their disposal a text-book written with con- stant uniformity and rigorous method. The guide or course followed in describing the organs should be inexorably systematic and always the same for each and every one of the organs, and should apply as well to the largest organs as to the smallest, even to a cell. It might be dry and monotonous reading for the cursory reader or for office-reading, but it would be of the greatest assistance to those who have to learn and to remember. It is true that all text-books on anatomy have about the same main divisions or headings in describing an organ, but it is specially in the details and smaller things under those headings that the students need systematic and uniform assistance. All superfluous words, remarks and dissertations were better omitted, so as to leave the facts as simple and prominent as 1 Read at the meeting of the Association of American Anatom- sts, at Washington, D.

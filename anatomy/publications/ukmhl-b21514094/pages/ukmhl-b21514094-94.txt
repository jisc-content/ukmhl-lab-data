78 THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. Part of the large lobe of the liver and also of the small one should be removed, but neither the gall- bladder nor Glisson's capsule, nor the lesser omentum should be injured. The right phrenic nerve should be traced, and its communication with a branch of the semilunar ganglion in a small ganglion which sends a branch to the left he- patic plexus, and filaments to the outside of the inferior cava; the left phrenic nerve should also be traced, and its communications by very fine filaments from the left semilunar ganglion j some of these accompany the phrenic artery, and the rest pass across the cardiac termination of the oesophagus to the left hepatic plexus. The great splanchnic nerves should be traced from the chest, and will be seen passing through the dia- phragm near the spine, to the semilunar ganglia, and these will be found placed on each side of the cceliac artery and the aorta just after this has passed through the diaphragm. The right hepatic plexus will be found surrounding the hepatic arteries and the gall ducts. Its communi- cations with the semilunar ganglia will be seen, and the branches sent from it along the pyloric and left inferior gastric arteries, to communicate with those of

70 PREPARATIONS OF THE PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS. may be more satisfactorily seen by carefully dividing the aorta at its arch: this, however, should not be done in making a dry preparation, as the parts thus become so much displaced; but for a wet preparation this inconvenience may be considerably remedied by drawing the cut edges of the artery together again by two or three long ligatures, and loosening them whenever it is necessary to make an examination. This dissection can only be performed by great care. The nerves forming each lateral cardiac plexus should be first traced to the bottom of the neck, and then their continuation along the great vessels to the heart, by proceeding a short distance first on one side, and then on the other. It will be necessary to support the heart, by placing cloths underneath it, and to hold the vessels apart with the chain hooks, whilst portions of fat, cellular membrane, and pericardium, are removed. Particular caution is required in separating the attach- ments of the vessels, as the junctions of the nerves passing over and underneath them may otherwise be divided. However slow the progress may appear in attempting to preserve every nerve, the dissection will in the end prove satisfactory; for, by hurry and impatience, some branches will be divided, and then inextricable confusion must be the consequence. Each trunk of the par vagum may be also traced on the oesophagus, to terminate in the stomach, &c.

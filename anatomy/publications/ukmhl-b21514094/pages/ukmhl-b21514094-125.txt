109 ON INJECTIONS. manner. The pipes being fixed in the blood-vessels at which the injection is to enter, plaster of Paris, to which some colouring matter has been added, as red lead or Prussian blue, must be put into a common basin or mortar, and rubbed with a pestle a little, so as to break down any lumps that it contains ; then water is to be added very gradually, until it has the consistence of cream ; as soon as it is mixed, for it sets in a few minutes, it is to be drawn into the syringe and immediately injected. A vessel containing cold water must be in readiness, that the syringe may be washed out as soon as ever the injection has been used, otherwise it will set in so hard as to make it necessary to take the syringe in pieces in order to clean it, which cannot be done without very great trouble. It will be very useful and convenient for anatomical purposes in general, and especially in the examination of morbid bodies, for it can be carried about with so little trouble, and the method of using it isvso easy. A very few minutes after the injection the subject may be dissected, and if any thing very uncommon occurs, the parts may be made into a good preparation ; this advantage is not derivable from any other cold injection.

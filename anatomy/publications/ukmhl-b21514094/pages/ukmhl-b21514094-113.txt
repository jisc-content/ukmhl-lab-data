D7 ON PREPARATIONS OF THE JOINTS. CHAPTER XIX. ON PREPARATIONS OF THE JOINTS. The large bones should if possible be bored, and have the marrow removed, but even then the joints in general are very unfavourable parts for making dry preparations, on account of the quantity of fat con- tained in them. The marrow should be extracted from the bone, and when the dissection of any one is completed, and all the fat removed, it must be put into the solution of the oxymuriate of mercury, where it must remain a fortnight, and it must then be varnished twice with mastich varnish, and in the course of a few weeks, when it appears to be perfectly dry, it must be covered twice with the best copal varnish, The joint should not be taken from an old subject, and the varnish should never be applied to the bone. In the same manner a whole limb, or indeed a whole subject, may be preserved so as to show all the joints. h

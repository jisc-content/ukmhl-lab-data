Vlll PREFACE. from a dissection preserved in spirits. With this previous information, and a much less time spent in dis- secting than has hitherto been deemed requisite, every one may readily become acquainted with the nervous system, and will moreover be better able to retain the knowledge he has acquired, because, by preserving the parts he has dissected, he will in a few minutes be able to clear up any doubts he may have about their distri- butions. This work is the result of many experiments made at a great expense and with much labour : and I am the more inclined to speak with confidence of its probable utility from the very flattering manner in which the Royal College of Surgeons have been pleased to express themselves in the following letter, respecting some of my preparations made according to the rules contained in it, and which were submitted to their judgment for the Jacksonian Prize. Royal College of Surgeons, 20 April, 1820. Sir, I have much pleasure in transmitting to you the inclosed, agreeably to the direction of the Board of Curators, and request the favour of your acknowledg- ment thereof for the information of the Board; and am further directed to inform you that the Board is much gratified with the Preparations received with your Dissertation, and that 6iich Preparations will be carefully preserved in the Museum, as examples of your labour and skill, and mode of preparing and exhibiting parts of animal bodies. I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Edmund Belfour, Secretary. Mr. Jos. Shan, Lincoln.

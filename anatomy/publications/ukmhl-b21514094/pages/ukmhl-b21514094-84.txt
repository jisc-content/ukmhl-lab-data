â– 68 PREPARATIONS OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. When the internal carotid artery has been traced to the entrance of the carotic canal, the bone forming this must be cut away with a chisel, until about half of the surface of the artery is exposed. The sixth should be traced into the cavernous sinus, and the fila- ments of this nerve accompanying the internal carotid artery; the second and third trunks of the fifth may next be divided just below their foramina, and by turning up the superior ends of these, filaments may be traced passing from the sympathetic and the sixth to the Gasserian ganglion, the nerves of the orbit, and the spheno-palatine ganglion. A filament proceeds from the sympathetic in the carotic canal into the tym- panum, to join the tympanine branch of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve ; this must be traced by cutting away the bone very carefully between the carotic canal and the tympanum into this cavity, and then removing the superior part of the membrane of the tympanum and the external auditory meatus, when the filament will be found as described in the eleventh chapter. For the dissection of the continuation of the sym- pathetic from the carotic canal to its termination, besides the directions given in the chapters respecting the nerves of the thoracic and abdominal viscera, a few inches of each spinal nerve should be left, the pleura should be stripped from the chest, and the

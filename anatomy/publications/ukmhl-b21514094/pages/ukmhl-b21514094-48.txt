It is farther necessary to remove every portion of cellular membrane from the nerves, that they may be as distinct as possible, otherwise where there are many minute branches in a small space, they will have such a confused appearance as to defeat the main purposes for which the preparations are made. Whilst prosecuting the dissection, it is desirable that the part should be kept in spirits, if it be probable that it will be long before it can be finished ; but at

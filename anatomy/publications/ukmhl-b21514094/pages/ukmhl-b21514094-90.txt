74 PREPARATIONS OF THE PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS cular, and pulmonary plexuses. These nerves are to be dissected by carefully separating the branches of the arteries and veins, the absorbent glands and cellular membrane; and the branches on the arteries themselves require considerable care and gentleness, for pulling them rudely with the forceps, or attempting to separate them hastily in any manner, will frequently destroy them. On the left side the dissection must be conducted in the same way, but it will be found that the principal part of the branches of the left lateral cardiac plexus, at the bottom of the neck, passes before and behind the arch of the aorta, and the rest along the subclavian artery, to communicate with the auricular and ven- tricular plexuses, and give branches to the large vessels and unite with others from the right side. The ventricular plexus, or the more solid part of it usually called the cardiac ganglion, will be found underneath the arch of the aorta ; it receives the prin- cipal part of the right and left lateral cardiac plexuses, and communicates with the auricular and left posterior pulmonary plexuses, and sends branches to accompany each coronary artery, to terminate in the ventricles of the heart. The auricular plexus is situated on the trachea near

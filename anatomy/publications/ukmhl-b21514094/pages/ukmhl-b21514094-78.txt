PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. brane covering the septum, and one which passes downwards and forwards through the incisive foramen to the palate. The palatine nerves pass down, con- sisting of two or three branches ; in their course some filaments are transmitted through small foramina to the membrane covering the turbinated bones; two or three small branches escape through foramina either in the palatine bone or at the junction of this with the ptery- goid process of the sphenoid, to terminate on the soft palate; and a large nerve passes through the palatine foramen, to divide into branches to be distributed on the roof of the mouth, and in one instance to com- municate near the first incisive tooth with the branch that passed through the incisive foramen. The second trunk will be found passing forward to the upper lip in a groove between the antrum and the floor of the orbit, but just on entering this at the pos- terior and exterior edge of the antrum, it sends off one or two dental branches to give filaments to the cellular membrane, &c. on the exterior of the antrum and the gums, and then pass through the bone of the antrum, and between this and its membrane into a groove just i above the alveolar processes ; a second branch joins this a little further on, and another a short distance from the infra-orbital foramen, and from this com- bination the teeth of the upper jaw are supplied.

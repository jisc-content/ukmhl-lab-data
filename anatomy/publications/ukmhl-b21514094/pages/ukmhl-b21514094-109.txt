OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN HERNIA. 93 the lower edge of which must be carefully separated from the transverse fascia; and if this separation is not sufficient for bringing the fascia properly into view, a small portion of the muscle must be re- moved. This being done, the round ligament or spermatic chord will be seen coming from the abdo- men, at which place the transverse fascia is much thinner than at any other part. If the fascia lata on the outside of the thigh be removed, and the handle of a scalpel passed behind Poupart's ligament, the iliac fascia may be separated some distance from the muscle, and thus both of the fascia? arising from Pou- part's ligament, together with that portion arising from the bone of the pubes, may be seen, forming a complete barrier to the protrusion of the bowels, except where the spermatic chord and femoral vessels escape from the abdomen. These parts are shown to much greater advantage if the femoral vessels are re- moved. If it be desired, other preparations can be made to show the exact position of the blood vessels, and like- wise the falciform process of the broad fascia, but these must be done according to the same plan. If the parts already described are to be shown in a preparation where the whole limb is preserved, the dissection may be finished according to the wish of the

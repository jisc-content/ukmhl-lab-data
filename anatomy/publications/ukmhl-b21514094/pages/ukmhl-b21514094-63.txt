PREPARATIONS OF THE OLFACTORY NERVES. 47 CHAPTER X. PREPARATIONS OF THE OLFACTORY NERVES. Make a perpendicular section through the nose close to the right side of the septum ; then detach the septum from the Schneiderian membrane covering its left side, by just breaking through a portion of the septum with the bone nippers, and then separating the bone from the membrane by the handle of a small knife, cut it away with the bone nippers quite up to the ethmoid bone, when filaments of the olfactory nerve will be seen on the portion of membrane to which the bone adhered. It is only in some prepa- rations that the nerves can be observed distinctly at the inferior part of the membrane. For having a view of the nerves passing on the membrane covering the turbinated bones, saw through the orbit and the antrum perpendicularly, and then, after breaking through a portion of the bone, and separating the membrane with the handle of a knife, carefully remove all the bone forming the

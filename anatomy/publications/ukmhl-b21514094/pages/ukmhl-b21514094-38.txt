2C2 ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM. for a fortnight, but the longer the better, and especially if the subject has been very putrid. The time it is in the solution must always be reckoned from the finishing of the dissection. Much trouble will be saved by having the dissection entirely finished before the limb is put into the solution, as it will not then be necessary to take it completely out of the box, but only to turn it over, and this should always be done several times, if the dissection has not been of such a nature as to incur any risk of its being injured thereby, or otherwise, when the limb is large, the part at the bottom will frequently lie so close to the box as to prevent the solution from getting to it. Every thing used must be clean and free from dust, and this precaution ought most especially to be attended to after the limb has been in the solution, as it then so readily attracts every particle of dirt, and by neg- lecting this a preparation may be entirely spoiled. When the limb has been long enough in the solu- tion, it is to be taken out and immersed in water for twenty-four hours, for the purpose of washing away any superabundant quantity of the oxymuriate which otherwise crystallises on the preparation and forms a white covering, which spoils its appearance, and it is

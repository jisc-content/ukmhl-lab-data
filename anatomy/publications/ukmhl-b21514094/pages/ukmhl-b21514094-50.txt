PREPARATIONS OF THE MINUTE NERVES. thirds of alcohol and one of water best preserve the natural size of the nerves. In making a good dissection, the student must give it his unwearied attention for many weeks, as he may by any hurry or carelessness for one moment divide the minute communications with other nerves, and all at once be involved in an inextricable labyrinth, and as so much time must be spent in the dissection, as would prevent the completion of the preparation before the natural changes of the subject have destroyed the appearance and texture of the different parts, there is no other way in which he can proceed so satisfactorily as by means of the pointed instrument like a single blade of scissors, and the use of water and alcohol alter- nately ; and if this method is pursued, which appears to me the only one by which a complete and satisfac- tory preparation can be made, the student will seldom be disappointed in making such dissections as will enable him to comprehend thoroughly the most difficult and intricate distributions and combinations of the nerves. In a general way, for preparations of the nerves, it is better not to inject the subject with minute injection for the preservation of the size of the muscles, for if the first object is the demonstration of the nerves, they will appear to greater advantage by the shrinking of the muscles.

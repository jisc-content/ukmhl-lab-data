95 PREPARATIONS OF THE EIVEtf. CHAPTER XVIII. PREPARATIONS OF THE LIVER. In order to preserve the natural appearance and size of the liver, it is necessary that the blood vessels and excretory ducts which compose so great a part of it, should be filled with injection to keep them distended. The best method in injecting the liver is to add one fifth part of turpentine varnish to white spirit varnish, and some colouring matter, as red lead, and first gently throw some of this into the vein of the porta and the excretory ducts, and then some coarse injection, which is necessary for the distension of the larger vessels. Some coarse injection should likewise be thrown into the hepatic artery. The liver does not require to be heated before it is injected. After the injection is finished, if it be a small liver, as a dog's, a fortnight will be sufficient for its immer- sion in the solution of oxymuriate of mercury ; but if a much larger one, a month will be necessary.

Having removed the top of the skull, divide the dura mater over each hemisphere, detach the greater falx from the crista galli, arid raise the posterior lobes of the brain a little, and divide the tentorium : then raise the anterior portion of the brain, and separate the nerves in succession, but leave them sufficiently long, and divide the spinal marrow as low as possible. Place the brain with its base upwards on a plate, and carefully remove the arachnoid membrane, the pia mater, and the vessels. Great care is required in doing this, near the origins of the nerves, as these become separated from the brain by the least rudeness. It may be necessary to place it in water for a few minutes, or an hour or two, as the vessels and mem- branes, when too dry, cannot easily be separated. After the removal of the membranes, it is to be placed in alcohol, and turned over at first twice every day, otherwise the part on which it rests lies so close to the

THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 79 each trunk of the par vagum, and terminate on the stomach, whilst other branches are sent from it to the duodenum and pancreas. The left hepatic plexus is formed of branches from the left trunk of the par vagum and from the left semi- lunar ganglion, sent across the cardiac termination of the oesophagus ; also from the small ganglion forming the communication between the right semilunar ganglion and the right phrenic nerve, passing behind the hepatic vessels; it then passes in the folds of the lesser omen- tum to the liver, and communicates with the right plexus, to accompany the branches of the hepatic artery and vein of the porta into the liver. The coeliac plexus is seen surrounding the cceliac artery, and frequently in the form of a membranous sheath. Branches may be traced from this along the splenic and pancreatic arteries to the spleen and pancreas, and along the branch of the splenic artery usually termed the left inferior gastric artery, to the stomach. The superior mesenteric plexus must next be traced; it surrounds the superior mesenteric artery in the form of a membranous sheath ; it arises princi- pally from the right semilunar ganglion, but communi-

PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. Gl terminates in the conjunctive membrane and skin of the upper eye-lid. The malar branch is rather more deeply placed than the temporal, and proceeds nearly at the bottom, within the exterior boundary of the orbit, through a hole in the malar bone to the cheek, to communicate with a branch of the facial nerve. It is proper for the student to have his attention called to the malar nerve, because he may sometimes easily trace it with little trouble in his preparations of the fifth and the nerves of the orbit, and it will be there- fore as well for him to defer dissecting it until he has finished most of the other parts of the nervous system. Soon after the second trunk has passed through the round foramen it communicates with the spheno- palatine ganglion, which is placed in a recess between the base of the pterygoid processes and the superior part of the palatine bone, and is sometimes very small and hardly like a ganglion : in some instances it adheres to the second trunk, and communicates by one or two short branches. This sends off the Vidian nerve, which enters the pterygoid foramen, and will be particu- larly described with the sympathetic. Small branches may be also traced to the Schneiderian mem-

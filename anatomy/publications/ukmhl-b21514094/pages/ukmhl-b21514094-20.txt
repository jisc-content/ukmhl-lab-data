4 ON PREVENTING PUTREFACTION experienced by tins treatment, or even by injecting the solution into the arteries. The subjects will thus undergo very little change for many days, so that each time the dissection is re-commenced, all the parts will be found in the state in which they were left; whereas in the usual way, in one, or at most two days, every thing will be so changed, that there is very little use in reviewing what has been done, and if the dis- section is tedious, what was first done can hardly be recognised at the finishing of all the parts. Another advantage is, that the dissection may be carried on in almost any place, and at any season of the year, as every offensive smell is generally entirely prevented. Supposing the subject to have been immersed in the solution, and that the dissection has again been proceeded with, and it is found that the parts more deeply seated are becoming putrid, it must again be immersed in the solution for two or three days, and then washed with water, and the dissection again per- severed in ; and the subject must again and again be submitted to the influence of the solution, until it ceases to emit any unpleasant smell. The dissection must be continued, and although many weeks elapse before it is finished, it may only be necessary to cover it with cloths made wet with water, or if it become too dry, to immerse it in water for a few hours or a

When all the nerves intended to be exhibited in the preparation have been sufficiently dissected, the part is to be immersed in the solution of oxymuriate of mercury, as has been described in the general illustration, and it must remain there a sufficient time. In a general way a fortnight will be sufficient, but if the part is very bulky and the muscles have not been much separated, a longer time must be allowed, as in this instance the deep-seated parts will not so soon imbibe the necessary influence of the solution.

There are two canals mistakenly called aqueducts, one leading from the vestibule called aqueduct of the vestibule, and the other from the cochlea called aque- duct of the cochlea. Both of the aqueducts may be seen in that preparation, where the vestibule has been laid open by cutting away the bone between the oval and round fenestras. The aqueduct of the vestibule may be seen beginning just opposite the opening made in the vestibule, and just below the common termina- tion of the superior and posterior semicircular canals. It terminates at a hole on the posterior or inner surface of the petrous portion three twelfths of an inch behind the internal auditory meatus. The aqueduct of the cochlea may be seen in the same preparation beginning at the under part of the scala of the tympanum, very near the round fenestra, and terminating by a wide opening, about three twelfths of an inch below the internal auditory meatus, and one twelfth of an inch from the anterior part of the jugular fossa. For the preparation of the auditory nerves, the

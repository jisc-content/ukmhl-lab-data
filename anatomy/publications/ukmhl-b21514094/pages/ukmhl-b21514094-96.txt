80 THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. cates with the left and the coeliac plexus. Its branches must be traced along the branches of the superior me- senteric artery to the small intestines; and along the ilio- colic, and the right colic arteries to the ccecum and colon, and by turning up the arch of the colon towards the sternum, the branches accompanying the middle colic artery may be traced to this part; the communication also with the aortic plexus may be traced. The mesentery and mesocolon should not be divided more than is absolutely necessary, as if these parts are too much separated from the arteries and nerves, great confusion will be the consequence. Numerous branches may be traced from the semi- lunar ganglia to the renal capsules, and the connexion of these parts will frequently be found more like the continuation of the ganglionic structure into that of the renal capsules, than ordinary branches of nerves. Eachemulgent plexus receives branches from the semi- lunar ganglion; it receives also the lesser splanchnic nerve, and frequently another branch from the last thoracic ganglion or its prolongation j these branches may be traced along the branches of the emulgent artery into the substance of the kidney. It is neces- sary to separate the cellular attachments of the kidney so that it may be turned towards the opposite side, as

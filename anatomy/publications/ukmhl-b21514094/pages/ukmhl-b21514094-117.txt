PREPARATIONS Or THE LUNOS AND HEART. 101 internal structure, its cavities should be opened so as not to injure the valves, and when it is wished to show all the valves distinctly it is better to divide the heart so as to make a separate preparation of each side. Before doing this the right ventricle should be opened nearly as far as the origin of the pulmonary artery, and then the pulmonary artery itself should be divided nearly down to the valves, that it may thus be seen how to cut between two of the semilunar valves, so that they may all be preserved perfect; any further dissection required to show the tricuspid valves should be made at the same time. Nearly in the same manner the left ventricle and aorta must be opened, after which the two sides of the heart should be separated. In making these dissections, about two or three inches of the aorta and pulmonary artery should be left. So much of each auricle may be removed as to show distinctly the opening into the ventricles. It is necessary to remove all the fat and cellular membrane, and after the dissection is finished, the parts are to be immersed in the solution of oxymuriate of mercury for a fortnight. When the parts are taken out, they must be sus- pended in the most convenient position for the preser-

64< PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. In the head, cut as described for a preparation of the second trunk, only some of the branches of the third can be shown, because the temporal and several other muscles have been already detached, but the branches going to the circumflex muscle of the palate and the chord of the tympanum may be best dissected in this. The preparation for showing the branches of the third trunk in the most easy way is to be made in the following manner. Having procured the half of a head cut perpendicularly, and removed a small por- tion of the vertex, trace the fifth towards the Gasserian ganglion, and the small or inner portion, not entering into the ganglion, will be observed on the inner side of this trunk. The head then being placed on its outside, cut away as much of the basilar portion of the occipital bone, of the sphenoid, and the anterior extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal, as will expose and open into the oval foramen j then cut away the squamous portion of the temporal bone with a chisel, so as not to divide the temporal muscle ; when a small portion of the bone has been removed, the adhesions between the bone and muscle may be easily separated and lace- rations prevented. It will be also necessary to remove a small portion of the palate and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. On the other side of this preparation the branches

44 PREPARATIONS OF THE SPINAL CHORD nations. For showing the posterior sacral branches more care is necessary in opening the canal of the sacrum ; the bone as far as the middle of the foramina should only be cut away at first, as each posterior branch passes immediately from the outer extremity of its ganglion, through its foramen. For demonstrating perfectly the spinal chord, after the spinal canal has been opened, the vertex should be removed ; also a large portion of the occipital bone, the saw being directed obliquely downwards towards lie spinal canal on each side ; and when the bone has been divided almost close to the large foramen, it will be better to separate the remaining part with the bone forceps, or a chisel. The greater part of the brain may then be removed, and also a portion of each side of the cerebellum, as their great weight will other- wise break through the connections of the nerves. Anterior Surface. For making a preparation of the anterior portion of the spinal chord and its nerves, the sternum should be divided perpendicularly through the middle and the ribs of the right side through their angles, so that the anterior portions may be taken away. The viscera of the thorax and abdomen should be removed, ex- cept the fundus of the bladder, and a small portion

54 OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. can al, which termination is about three twelfths of an inch from the middle of the po sterior part of the inter- nal auditory meatus, and in the foetus two twelfths. In tracing the posterior canal backwards, its inferior extremity will be found at about three and a half twelfths of an inch from the jugular fossa, and in the foetus rather more than two twelfths of an inch from the stylo-mastoid foramen. These two canals being laid open, the petrous portion behind them must be cut away until the exterior semi- circular canal is opened. It is placed horizontally about four twelfths of an inch deeper in the bone than the top of the superior canal, and is nearly even with the superior part of the anvil. In the foetus it is three twelfths of an inch deeper in the bone than the top of the superior canal. The labyrinth is most easily dissected in the foetus, for it is as perfect as in the adult, whilst the surrounding bone is so soft as to be very easily cut with a knife, but the adult's ear makes the most beautiful preparation. In the foetus the course of a great part of the superior and posterior semicircular canals may be seen without any dissection. The cochlea is now to be dissected. It lies with its base to the internal auditory meatus, and its point to

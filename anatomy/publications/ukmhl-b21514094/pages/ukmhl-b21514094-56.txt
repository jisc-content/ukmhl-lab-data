PREPARATIONS OF THE BRAIN. to After it lias been sufficiently painted it must be varnished with the white spirit varnish two or three times. As it is impossible to suspend it for this pur- pose, the upper surface must be varnished and suffered to dry j it must then be turned over, so that the varnish may be applied to the part that was in contact with the plate. Every time the varnish is used it is necessary to have very little in the brush, which should only just touch each part once. Without this pre- caution the paint will be disturbed, and the proper appearance of the brain destroyed. In the same manner both the brain and spinal chord may be preserved in their natural situations in preparations for showing the origins of the nerves. Many experiments have been made to dry the brain, so as to prevent its shrinking, by first boiling it in different varnishes, but none of these answered so well ns the foregoing process ; but of the varnishes used, the mastich appeared to penetrate the deepest. When the brain has been removed it will be best to make a preparation of the base of the skull, for showing the course of the nerves through the different foramina. The nerves on one side, and the parts surrounding them, should not be touched. On the other side the upper margin of the superior lacerated

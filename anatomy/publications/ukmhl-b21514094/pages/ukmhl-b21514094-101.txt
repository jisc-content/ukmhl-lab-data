85 OF THE WHOLE BODY. fixing the pipes so as not to interfere with the nerves, requires the greatest care, and even with every pre- caution, it is most probable that the nerves of this organ will be too much interfered with for making a perfect dissection. The display of the nerves alone is a work requiring much perseverance, and the preserva- tion of the arteries at the same time will add very considerably to the labour. The greatest part of each lung must be removed sufficiently far from its root for leaving the par vagum and its principal branches perfect; the pleura must be carefully stripped off the ribs, but when the pos- terior mediastinum is approached, gentleness is neces- sary. The pericardium should be opened so as to avoid the phrenic nerves. For showing the nerves of the abdominal viscera it may be necessary to cut away a portion of the abdo- minal muscles, but as these will retract considerably in a dry preparation, the removal of the upper two thirds of the straight muscle of each side will give sufficient space ; but if the viscera can be conveniently dissected without this mutilation, it will be best to wait till the parts are nearly dry. The right lateral ligament of the liver may be divided, and a consider- able part of the right lobe removed; some care is required for avoiding any injury to this part of the

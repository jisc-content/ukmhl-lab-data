PREPARATIONS OF THE SPINAL CHORD 42 CHAPTER IX. PREPARATIONS OF THE SPINAL CHORD AND ITS NERVES. Posterior Surface. For making a preparation of the posterior surface of the spinal chord and its nerves, the subject should be placed so that the head may hang over the edge of the table. An incision should be made through the integuments, from the back of the head to the extremity of the sacrum ; the muscles on each side of the spinous processes should be then separated and partly removed. The spinous processes should next be cut off at their bases with a chisel, or sawn through from either side. The canal must then be freely opened by cutting through the base of each spinous process with a chisel, or a pair of strong cutting forceps. After this, the sheath formed by the dura mater should be opened, care being taken to avoid cutting the nerves which have escaped from it, by holding up its edge with the forceps and separating with the pointed instrument any fat and cellular membrane surrounding the nerves.

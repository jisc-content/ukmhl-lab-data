The heart and its large vessels must be preserved, as well as most of the branches of the subclavian and carotid arteries ; but the subject must not be injected, as these parts when distended cannot conveniently be drawn aside, and placed in such positions as are frequently necessary for the dissection of the nerves. For the purpose of showing the pharyngeal plexus the lower jaw should be separated at its articulation, the whole of the sterno-mastoid muscle should be removed, and the sternal extremities of the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles detached, but left adhering to the hyoid bone.

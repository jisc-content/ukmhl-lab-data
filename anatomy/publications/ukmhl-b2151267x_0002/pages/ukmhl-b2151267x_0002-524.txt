90G HUNTSRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. material over its rougli surfaces. It consists of uric acid mixed with a good deal of oxalates formed in very dense fine laminae. It is very hard. {Hunterian Plate IX., figs. 5 and 6, its external surface before cutting and its cut surface both being figured.) *53.42. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus as large as a hen's egg. It consists of a dense shell about 1 cm. thick, in which lie, quite loose, a number of coarse rough granules, in size from that of a hemp seed to that of a pea. The figure shows that originally it had a compact nucleus, in appearance like a calcium oxalate calculus, which is now absent. The loose granules consist of uric acid with a considerable amount of calcium oxalate and much organic matter. The shell is of uric acid with a trace of calcium oxalate. {Hunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 9.) 53.43. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A large stone of pure uric acid with a small calcium oxalate calculus of irregular oval shape for its nucleus. 53.44. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A stone about the size of a hen's egg, composed of alternate layers of granular and laminated uric acid, with traces of calcium oxalate round a nucleus which consists of two small dense uric acid calculi. *53.45. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A somewhat smaller stone, consisting of a finely laminated dense centre, an intermediate granulated layer, and an outer dense shell of uric acid mixed with a good deal of calcium oxalate. {Hunterian Plate XVII., fig. 2.) . 53.46. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus composed throughout of uric acid and a trace of calcium oxalate, formed in fine laminae, very compact and hard like the centre of the preceding.

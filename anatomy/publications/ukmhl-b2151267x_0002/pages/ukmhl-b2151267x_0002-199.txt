" The lower portion of the bladder, opened from before, the lower portion of the penis also ; the bulb of the urethra is opened ; it contained a stone very n.early as large as a hen's egg; there was a fistulous orifice from it in perinaeo : from an old man in the dissecting room."

Hypertrophy of the Prostate Gland, and Morbid Conditions resulting therefrom. 43.15. Enlarged Prostate. Hypertrophy and Dilatation of the Bladder. Hunterian. AA. 47. A bladder distended and hardened with spirit, cut open in front, showing the above conditions. Though the bladder is distended to far above the normal size, its wall appears nearly 1 cm. thick—a very considerable degree of hypertrophy. It is also fasciculated, the thickened strands of muscle standing out like pillars with pouches of mucous membrane protruded between them. The pros- tate is not markedly enlarged as a whole, but the middle lobe sticks up prominently, producing a sharp bend in the urethra, and also projects into the bladder creating behind itself the character- istic deep pocket in the region of the trigone, which the bladder is unable to empty, and in which the so-called residual urine stag- nates. 43.16.

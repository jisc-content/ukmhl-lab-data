598 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. is separated from the vagina by the perinaeum, which is about 2'5 cm. broad. On the other side of the specimen are seen parts of the cavities of the bladder, vagina, and rectum. "The parts were kept extended with melted wax, then hardened in spirits, after which the wax was removed." 44.2. The External Organs of Generation in the Female. Hunterian. CC. 6. The same parts as the preceding. The labia only slightly separated. The hymen, " very perfect," can be seen on holding the specimen np to the light. Its orifice, as in the former, is a very small slit, running longitudinally and slightly oblique. Behind, the crura clitoridis are displayed by dissection. 44.3. The External Organs of Generation in the Female. Hunterian. CC. 7. The labia majora rather more separated. A blue glass rod is passed through the urethra. The hymen is perfect, and shows the commonest form of that structureâ€”a crescentic fold of mucous membrane round the sides and back of the vagina, leaving a round or slightly oval aperture, which "will admit a goose quill." The horns of the crescent run forward in a pair of thin loose folds to the sides of the meatus urinarius. The hymen is stretched by a pad of cotton wool. Compare No. 7 of this series. 44.4. The External Genitals of a Very Young Female Child. Hunterian. CC. 13tt. The same parts, but very small, extended in a similar manner. There is a little thread or frenum passing from the meatus urinarius to the hymen, marked by a bristle. The labia minora project as far as the labia majora. Compare No. 14 of this series. 44.5. The External Genitals of a Female Child "at Two Years." Hunterian. CC. 12. Similar to the preceding ; a little larger; bristles in the urethra, vagina, and anus.

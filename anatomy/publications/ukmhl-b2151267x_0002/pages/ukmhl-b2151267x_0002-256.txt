638 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 45.89. Simple Cyst of the Ovary. Hunferian. CC. 51. Fallopian tube, slit open, with a cyst of the ovary (a " dropsy of the ovarium " as it was called in Hunter's time), about 5 cm. in diameter, hanging from it by the fimbriated process. 45.90. Simple Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 50c. Right broad ligament suspended by the Fallopian tube, which is stretched horizontally above. Hanging from it by the meso- salpinx, and forming the lower part of the specimen, is a simple cyst of the ovary about the size of a hen's egg. The cut edge of the broad ligament, with the mass of ovarian veins in section, injected with vermilion, is seen above the cyst and indicates which is the front of the specimen. 45.91. Simple Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 45. Uterus, its anterior wall removed, and the appendages of the left side, showing the ovary converted into a large cyst, which is lobulated externally, having evidently originated from several follicles. The specimen is hung by the uterus and left round ligament, in such a way as to show how the cyst hangs out clear from the back of the broad ligament. The Fallopian tube is separated by the width of the mesosalpinx from the attachment of the tumour to the back of the broad ligament. Contrast the relations of this ovarian cyst with those of No. 45.113, which is a parovarian cyst. 45.92. Simple Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 49. A very similar cyst laid open on one side, showing the thin transparent walls, and the cavity loculated from the presence of incomplete partitions, which indicate its origin from a number of follicles. On the outside just below the opening, is a small cyst, which does not communicate with the general cavity. 45. 93. Portion of Colloid Cystoma (Adenoma) of the Ovary. Hunterian. F. 6. A section from the exterior of a specimen of the above class of tumour, showing the characteristic arrangement of the cysts.

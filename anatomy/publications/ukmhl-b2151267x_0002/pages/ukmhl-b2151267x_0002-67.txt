THE SMALL INTESTINE. 449 blood-vessels, having entered from the mesentery and passed through the muscular coat without dividing, branch and run in all directions as is seen in its outer aspect; its inner aspect shows the finer ends of these vessels which pass through the muscularis mucosae into the mucous coat, and, here and there, the deep parts of lymphatic follicles which have remained with it. The third laj^er consists of the greater part of the muscular coat, showing two layers of fibres as in preceding preparations, and the serous coat. A beautiful specimen. 35.9. The Jejunum. The Valvulae Conniventes. Hinderian. P. 9. A portion of the jejunum from an adult, slit open to show the mucous coat of the intestine, thrown into transverse rugae some what like those of the stomach in its contracted state, but unlike them in being permanent. They are called valvulae conniventes; they serve to increase the secreting and absorbing- surface of the intestines. 35.10. The Jejunum. The Valvulae Conniventes. Hunterian. P. 10. A portion of the upper part of the small intestine inverted, showing, as in the previous specimen, the valvulae conniventes. The valvulae and the hollows between them are covered with villi. 35.11. The Jejunum. The Valvulae Conniventes. Hunterian. P. 11. Similar to the preceding. In the edges of some of the rugae and between them are seen round knots, which are solitary lymphatic follicles. These are similar in structure to the cell masses of lymphatic glands. 35.12. The Ileum. Hunterian. P. 14. A portion of the lower part of the small intestine, inverted, showing the principal difference from the preceding, viz. that the valvulae conniventes are very small, mere traces, and at wide intervals.

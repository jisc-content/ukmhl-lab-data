HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 930 extremely soft fusible phosphates mixed with calcium carbonate which effervesces freely with hydrochloric acid. The rest of the calculus is mixed phosphates. {Hunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 3.) 53.143. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a calculus as large as a goose's egg, broken at one end, consisting of mixed phosphates in regular laminae round a uric acid stone nearly as large as a hen's egg. The phosphates are of pinkish- white and pale grey colour. 53.144. Uric Acid and Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A small stone with relatively large nucleus of granular uric acid and calcium oxalate. 53.145. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A large calculus of irregular shape with nucleus of pale uric acid and ammonium urate. 53.146. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A small irregularly shaped calculus with a nucleus of ammonium urate and mixed phosphates rather denser than the body of the calculus. It almost amounts to a calculus of mixed phosphates of primary formation. *53.147. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a long oval calculus consisting of a small nucleus of ammonium urate, then a considerable, well-defined, yellowish mass of the same matter mixed with fusible phosphates, and the external layers phosphates with distinct trace of ammonium urate. {Hun- terian Plate XVIII., fig. 2.) 53.148. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. An oval calculus very like the preceding, the central parts white and containing less urate and more phosphate.

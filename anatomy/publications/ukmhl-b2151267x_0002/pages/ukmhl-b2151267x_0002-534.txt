916 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 53.84. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium, with some Calcium Oxalate. Hmterian. Half of a calculus about the size of a hen's egg, composed of pale brown matter, which is hard and brittle but rather porous, and containing much urate of ammonium. Near the outside is a layer of several fine laminae of calcium oxalate, then again a tiiin shell of material like the centre, but containing some oxalate. The outside is rough and shows traces of phosphates. 53.85. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium. Hunterian. A small calculus with a centre of the typical dense urate of ammonium, round which is a layer of saffron-coloured porous matter, for the most part uric acid, and lastly a layer of pale brownish- white matter similar to the centre, but containing also traces of calcium oxalate. 53.86. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium, with some Calcium Oxalate. Hantenan. An oval calculus about the size of a hen's egg, composed through- out of coarse granules only moderately firmly agglutinated together. The exterior is very roughly tuberculated, from being composed of these granules with less agglutinating material between them than there is inside the stone. The granules give the murexide and ammonia reactions, decrepitate violently before the blowpipe, and leave a small mineral ash which effervesces with hydrochloric acid. 53.87. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium. Hunterian. A stone of quite irregular shape, composed of very soft porous pale brown material, which burns away completely before the blowpipe, and gives murexide and ammonia reactions. Appears to consist of urate of ammonium and uric acid, as the evolution of ammonia is not very abundant.

653 INCUBATED EGGS. 46.16. Chick on the Eighteenth Day, with the AUantois and Yolk. Hunterian. NN. 63. Similar preparation, the allantois with the chorion and shell membrane attached hanging below, its vessels beginning to atrophy; it retains the shape of the egg. The yolk sac is beginning to be drawn into the abdomen. 46.17. The Contents of the Egg about the Eighteenth Day. Hunterian. A chick in a similar stage of development, the enveloping mem- brane intact. The yolk sac lies between the legs, pressed upon the abdomen. 46.18. Chick on the Nineteenth Day. Hunterian. NN. 64. " Yolk more than half taken into the abdomen, vessels on the inside of the shell much shrunk," i.e. allantois much atrophied. The yolk sac is much reduced in size. 46.19. Chick newly Hatched; its Abdomen Opened. Hunterian. NN. 66. " Opened to show urachus" (stalk of the allantois) " entering the under side of rectum " (cloaca) " and admitting a crow-quill." Compare with the manner in which the urachus is attached to the top of the bladder in mammals.

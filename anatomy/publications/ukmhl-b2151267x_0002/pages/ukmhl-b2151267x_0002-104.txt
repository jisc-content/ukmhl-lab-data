Tubercular Ulcers of the Small Intestine. Hunterian. F. 90. Piece of small intestine inverted, injected red, "from a child in the dissecting room," showing two round ulcers, with raised, ragged, overhanging edges, deeply excavated, the outer (longitudinal) muscular coat showing in the floor of the larger, which extends about half-way round the gut. They evidently begin in the Peyer's patches of lymphatic follicles, but extend far beyond them. "The injection appears at the ulcerated mouths of the arteries." Compare succeeding specimens. Microscopic examination : tubercular. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 71.) Matthew Baillie's Engravincjs, Fasc. IV., PI. II., fig. 1. 36.68. Tubercular Ulcers of the Small Intestine. Huntericm. P. 90a. Another portion of the same intestine, slit open along the mesenteric attachment, showing an ulcer of similar character, but extending nearly all round the gut. It appears to have been tend- ing to heal, and the process of cicatrization has been attended by marked contraction, producing considerable constriction of the canal. Injected red. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 71.) 36.69. Tubercular Ulcers of the Small Intestines. Hunterian. P. 906. Another portion of intestine from the same case, slit open along the free edge so as to divide the ulcers and exhibit their depth and the overhanging edges. The sloughs have separated verj' completely. The ulcerated surface is decidedly less vascular than the surrounding mucous membrane. There are also a few subperitoneal tubercles, recognizable as white avascular spots. A portion of the lower of these ulcers was used for microscopic examination. They are clearly tubercular. (MS. Notes., J.H.T., p. 71.)

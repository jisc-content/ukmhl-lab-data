416 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. (c) The Pho,Tynx and Tonsils. 31.28. The Pharynx. Hunterian. GG. 36. The upper part of the pharynx, root of tongue, epiglottis and larynx injected red. The pharynx is laid open behind, and the specimen hangs by it. Shows the relations of the base of the tongue and the larynx. Compare Nos. 17.14 and 17.15, and 21.50 and 21.51. 31.29. The Isthmus of the Fauces and the Pharynx. Hunterian. GG. 37. A section has passed through the base of the skull, nose, roof of mouth, tongue and lower jaw posterior to the upper teeth, but about the second molars in the lower jaw, and the middle part of the base of the skull posterior to the plane of this, comprising most of the sphenoid and anterior part of the basi-occipital, has been removed with the pharynx and larynx. The specimen shows in front, the cavity of the nose, part of hard palate, uvula, tonsils (which are very small), base of the tongue, and posterior wall of the pharynx. Behind is seen a dissection of the superior, middle, and inferior constrictors of the pharynx; the fibrous layer of the pharynx is attached to the body of the sphenoid right across. The fibres of all three pairs of muscles intersect in the middle line, and diverge in a similar manner slanting downwards, and are attached at the sides to the hamular and pterygoid processes, root of tongue, hyoid bone and thyroid and cricoid cartilages; bristles indicating the attachment of the middle constrictors to the great cornua of the hyoid bone, delimit the extent of their several insertions. 31.30. The Tonsils and Pharynx. Hunterian. GG. 38. Part of the lower jaw, lower lip, tongue and larynx finely injected red, hanging by the lip; showing above, the tonsils considerably enlarged, and a number of enlarged lymphatic glands outside the pharynx; below, the anterior bellies of the digastric, part of the mylohyoid muscles, the submaxillary gland, and a number of enlarged lymphatic glands of the submaxillary and deep cervical! sets.

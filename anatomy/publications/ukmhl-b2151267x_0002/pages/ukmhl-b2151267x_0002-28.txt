SERIES 30. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE LIPS, GUMS, AND TEETH. 30.1. Teeth Deformed by Stomatitis. Hunterian. PP. u. " Six incisors from the second set; the enamel waved like wreaths of snow, in the horizontal direction." These teeth, particularly about the crowns, are small and covered with transverse markings, due to defective formation of the enamel. This is also defective over the edges of the teeth, exposing the dentine, which is worn down, and of a dark colour. The condition may be the result of mercurial stomatitis while the teeth were forming. It is not the condition characteristic of congenital syphilis. Dry on blue paper. 30= 2. The Tartar of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 76. Three rows of teeth coated with tartar, which is a concretion of earthy salts and mucus from the saliva, which forms on the teeth, chiefly about the edges of the gums, and is a frequent cause of ulceration of them. Dry on blue paper. 30.3. Caries of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 77. Several rows of teeth, mounted dry on blue paper, showing different degrees of caries, ranging from a small hole in the side to exposure of the pulp and more or less complete destruction of the crown. 30.4. Enlargement of the Roots of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 45a. Twelve teeth mounted dry on blue paper, " every root having a sort of node or exostosis, by which its extremity is the largest part, and which would make the extraction of such teeth more difficult and dangerous."

651 INCUBATED EGGS. eye, and the four visceral clefts, and five visceral folds. Also the pit of the ear dorsal to the first visceral fold, and the heart in front of the neck. An imperfect specimen. 4-6.7. The Blastoderm, Embryo, Area Vasculosa and Allan- tois. "Fifth Day." Huaterian. NN. 35. The embryo and area vasculosa spread out on blue paper, viewed from above; badly torn. The area vasculosa is about 6 cm. broad. The embryo lies on its left side, enveloped in the amnion ; it is strongly curved. From the abdomen at the tail end rises a round bag about 1 cm. in diameter, which is the allantois. " At a hundred and twenty hours, or fifth day complete." 46.8. Embryo Chick "on the Sixth Day." H'lmterian. N.N. 37. A similar preparation, showing the embryo lying in the centre of the large area vasculosa. The amnion is torn, showing the embryo well formed, the head very large, the fronto-nasal process beginning to project like a beak, and the limbs distinct. The avian characters are not yet distinct. The allantois is not well shown. Very imperfect. 46.9. The Contents of the Egg at the " Eighth Day" of Incubation. Huuterian. NN. 42. The whole contents of the egg, the shell and shell membranes and outer layer of amnion removed, "hanging by one of the chalazae." The blastoderm, in the form of area vasculosa, has extended over more than one-half of the yolk. Its vessels are less distinct than in earlier specimens. The white has been ab- sorbed into the yolk, which is now larger than it was at first, forming fully half of the specimen. At the lower end is the transparent allantois, now a large sac with numerous blood-vessels, which was spread out between the amnion and the membranous lining of the shell. Lastly, the chick about 2 cm. long can be seen at the lower end of the specim.en, enclosed in the amnion, which now envelops it loosely. Compare next specimen. II. R

538 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. of Mr. Luinsden, who died of suppression of urine; one kidney was quite destroyed by a ragged stone nearly the size of a walnut; the other was very pulpy, and had a stone in the ureter plugging it up." This specimen is the first mentioned kidney; it is converted into an irregular clump of thin-walled cavities, without a trace of renal tissue. The calculus is phosphatic. The next specimen (X. 1076) shows the other kidney. The cortex has been pared off it, and several of the medullary pyramids can be seen of fairly normal appearance, with rather pulpy cortex between them. The pelvis is considerably increased in size. The kidney was evidently functionally active to a certain extent, as "there was water in the bladder after death." The urethra was patent. The calculus is composed of uric acid. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 129.) 41.20. Renal Calculus Impacted in the Ureter. Hunterian. X. 1076. The other kidney from same subject as the preceding, which see. 41.21. Kidney with Dilated Pelvis, containing Minute Calculi. Hunterian. X. 106. Most of the calculi have been removed, but deep in the calyces of the pelvis a number are still to be seen. They are composed of uric acid. Said to have been " perhaps 500," about the size " of small pinheads." The artery is injected red; the vein yellow. Some of the lymphatics were also injected. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.22. Large Branched Calculus in the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 103. A kidney with part of the ureter, one side removed, showing a large white calculus, which fills the upper part of the pelvis, " ramifying as the infundibula," and presses on, and has destroyed a considerable part of the renal tissue. There are a number of retention cysts scattered about the kidney. 41.23. Large Branched Renal Calculus. Hunterian. X. 100. A kidney, injected red and one side cut away, showing the pelvis and its infundibula or calyces dilated and occupied by a

TAPEWORMS. 515 39.12. Bothriocephalus Latus. Hunterian. Q. 9. Another specimen, probably of the same tapeworm. Head absent. (6) Taenia Echinococcus. 39.13. Hydatid of the Liver. Taenia Echinococcus. Hunterian. U. 45. This parasite is the scolex form of the tapeworm called taenia echinococcus, the adult form (strobilus) of which is a very insig- nificant worm, about \ of an inch in length, inhabiting the dog. It is found in all known lands, and is very common in Iceland and Australia. The scolex in the form of hydatids has been found in nearly all the organs of the body, but is most common in the liver. The specimen consists of a thick fibrous capsule, which envelops the parasite; one side of it is cut out, exposing a trans- lucent bladder, which is the proper outer cyst (ectocyst) of the animal—the stratified chitinous envelope of the parasite. Within this lies the growing endocyst, from which develop the brood capsules, in which the echinococcus heads grow. 39.14. Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 45a. A smaller specimen of the same parasite, the fibrous capsule cut open, showing inside the collapsed remains of the animal. 39.15. Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 46. Another specimen of the same parasite, the fibrous capsule cut open, showing, as is often the case, several hydatid cj'sts. These have fallen out, and lie on the bottom of the jar. The fibrous cyst appears to be lined with an irregular layer of fibrin. Each hydatid cyst appears to contain a number of daughter cysts. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. V., PI. V., fig. 1.) 39.16. Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 60. A large, thick-walled fibrous cyst, laid open, and a very trans- parent hydatid, about the size of a hen's egg, lying on the bottom of the jar. "•■

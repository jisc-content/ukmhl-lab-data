Tuberculosis of the Ileum, Ileo-colic Valve and Vermiform Appendix. Ulceration and Stricture of the Intestine. â€” The lower end of the ileum and caput caecum laid open. An irregular ulcer, with overhanging edges and ragged floor, extends from about 3 cm. above the ileo-colic valve to about 1 cm. into the colon, the whole edge of the valve being stripped of mucous mem- brane and thickened. The walls of the viscera are thickened to nearly 1 cm. over an extent considerably wider than the ulceration, and involving the orifice of the appendix. They are fairly hard. There has been considerable contraction of the whole diseased area, and on restoring the shape of the bowel it appears that a very tight stricture had been produced. There is no history. Microscopic examination showed the disease to have been tubercular. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 93.) 36.87. Tubercular Ulcer of the Colon. Perforation. Hunteriun. li. 39ft.

"A part of the great intestines with a large ragged ulcer, which had destroyed a part of all the coats, whereby a communication had been formed between the cavity of the intestine and that of the abdomen. The external coat surrounding the ulcer is puckered, or thrown into small rugae from the contraction of the muscular coat, and the whole substance of the intestine is thickened."

629 MYOMA OF THE UTERUS. 45. 50. Sloug-hing Myoma of the Uterus. Hunterian. CO. 107. One half of uterus and vagina, and half of a large myoma springing from the fundus uteri: The tumour has been a solid mass about the size of a child's head at birth, attached to the uterus by ragged strands of fibrous tissue. Here and there among those strands are little balls, which are found on microscopic examination to be extremely sclerosed balls of fibrous tissue with remains of a few muscle cells ; these have preserved their structure sufficiently for purposes of identification, while the softer parts of the myoma have undergone complete disintegration.

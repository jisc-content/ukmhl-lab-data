SINGLE MONSTERS. 811 50.51. Acephalic Acardiac Monster. Dog (?). Fro7n Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. (Mylacephale.) A pair of hind legs, with a short rod-like axial bone, which is all that represents the pelvis. They are articulated with their heads close together. There is a penis and testicles. The right leg ends in a very malformed foot; the other in a rounded hairy knob. Apparently a monstrosity of the dog, though it is difficult to say what the animal has been. DIVISION III Single Monstrosities ; Monstra per Defectum ; MONSTRES UnITAIRES. {a) Divarfing; Zwergmissbildungen. The only examples of this condition in the museum are an articulated foot and leg which is placed in Series 5, Diseases of Bone, No. 1, and the portrait of Owen Farrell, or Leather-coat Jack, a dwarf well known in London in the 18th century, which is in the Picture Gallery: No. 43. (h) Malformations of Individual Systems and Organs. MALFORMATIONS OF THE LIMBS. 50.52. Sympus Dipus. Anencephalus. Human. Hunterian. MM. 15. (Symele.) A male foetus, finely injected red, and the anterior parietes of the thorax and abdomen removed. There is complete anencephalia and spina bifida, the whole cranial vault being wanting and the vertebral canal opened and flattened out into a wide shallow gutter covered by soft vascular membrane and with no recognizable spinal cord. The body ends below in a conical process, bifid at its extremity. The single part of this consists of the thighs, and the bifid parts are the legs. They end in very much deformed feet—that of the right having two toes, that of the left only one—and both feet are flexed to an acute angle upon the legs. The compound limb is more freely flexible upon the trunk forwards than backwards. The knee-joint bends forwards, and the soles of the feet are reversed, n. 2d

642 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 45.102. Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 53. Other part of the preceding. In the old catalogue it is remarked that there is " no foetus nor bone," apparently an allusion to the old idea that these tumours were the result of parthenogenesis or ordinary conception, and represented the remains of an imperfectly formed child. See also under No. 45.109. 45.103. Contents of Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 546. A ball of hair and fat about 6 cm. in diameter, from a tumour similar to No. 45. 101. 45.104. Hair Ball from a Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 55. "A tuft of hair from an ovarium, very considerable." 45.105. Hair Ball from a Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary. Hunterian. CC. 56. 45.106. Dermoid Cyst of the Ovary. Bilateral. Jeffray Collection. Uterus and appendages showing both ovaries converted into dermoid cysts. The right, rather larger than a hen's egg, is incised to show the contents, which are of the usual characterâ€” yellow fat of buttery consistence mixed with hairs. The left has been divided and the contents removed to show the character of the cyst wall. The cyst wall is generally thin, smooth, and hairless. At the attachment of the tumour to the broad ligament is a thick mass, the remains of the ovary, which in section shows a couple of small dermoid cysts, and an irregularly-shaped concretion, hard and translucent like horn, black in colour, but having a reddish tint when looked through. The surface of this part of the tumour which looks into the main cyst is rough, porous, and papillated, and shows one or two small tufts of reddish- brown hairs.

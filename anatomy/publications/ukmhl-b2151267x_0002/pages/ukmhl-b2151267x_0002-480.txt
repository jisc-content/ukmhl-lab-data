862 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 52.10. Crystalline Oholesterine Gall Stone. Eunteriau. Portion of a stone very like No. 52.8. Its outside is dark from a deposit of bilirubin calcium among the tubercles. Sinks in water. 52.11. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. Portion of a small globular calculus, broken, showing similar characters. There is a good deal of pigment among the crystals of the centre. Laminated towards the outside. Sinks in water. 52.12. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. A small oval calculus, broken, showing beautifully distinct long radiating crystals. It is covered with a soft yellowish amorphous layer of bilirubin calcium mixed with traces of cholesterine. Sinks slowly in water. 52.13. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian, A half of a globular stone of moderate size, coated with a thin layer of bilirubin calcium. Sinks in water. 52.14. Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. Two large calculi, uncut, composed largely of cholesterine. The two fit into one another by faceted ends. Together they form a long oval mass the shape of the gall bladder, measuring 5 by 2*7 cm. The exterior is pale yellow like beeswaxâ€”pure choles- terine ; the faceted ends show a coating of bile pigment matter (bilirubin calcium) mixed with cholesterine. Apparently of the same class as No. 52.5, but floats freely in water, therein resem- bling the stones of the next class. DIVISION II. Mixed Gall Stones, of Cholesterine and Bilirubin Calcium combined in various j^foportions and arrangements. (a) laminated cholesterine calculi. Consisting, for the most part, of cholesterine (a crystalline mass of which usually forms the centre), more or less darkly coloured by admixture with a varying amount of bilirubin calcium.

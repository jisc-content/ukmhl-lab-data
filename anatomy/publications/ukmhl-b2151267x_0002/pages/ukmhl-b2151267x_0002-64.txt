446 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 34.32. Carcinoma of the Pylorus. Ulcerating. Mucous Polypus of the Stomach. Hunteriim. Not described. The specimen consists of the pyloric end of the stomach, with a fringe of duodenum, slit open and hung with the pylorus about the middle of the jar and looking to the spectator's right. There has been a hard tumour of some- what conical shape, smooth on the outside and ulcerated within, extending almost all round the viscus just within the pylorus, the edges of which and the duodenum are unaffected. It measures, when bent into its natural position, 11 cm. long by 3 to 7 cm. in diameter. Its edges are thick and firm. On section it presents the structure of a carcinoma of the scirrhous type. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 32.) The calibre of the viscus has been considerably narrowed, and there is at the cardiac edge of the ulcer a cauliflower-like excrescence, which falls into the orifice when let alone, and was probably capable of completely obstructing it. This structure consists of greatly hypertrophied mucous membrane with very loose oedematous-looking fibrous tissue between the glands. Though it rests just at the edge of the ulcer, it is probably a mucous polypus and not connected with the cancer. Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. III., PI. VII., fig. 1.

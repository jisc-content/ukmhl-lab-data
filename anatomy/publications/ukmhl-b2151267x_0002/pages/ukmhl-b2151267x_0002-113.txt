CARCINOMA OF THE INTESTINE. 495 bought at Falconar's sale, and resembles dysenteric intestine much." The ileo-caecal valve is also thickened, and considerably constricted. The caecum is very much shrunk; the appendix on the other hand is greatly thickened, its lumen dilated, and its mucous membrane thickened and rugose, like that of the caecum. Sections prepared from caecum and appendix show (though the tissues are very much degenerated) the structure of a carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 75.) 36.107. Carcinoma of the Sigmoid Flexure and Rectum. Hunterian. R. 53a. The sigmoid flexure and rectum slit open. The whole loop of the former is thickened and in places ulcerated, and its concavity is occupied by a bulky tumour which is ulcerated internally. There is a second carcinomatous ulcer, with hard edges and depressed excavated centre, in the rectum about 5 cm. above the anus. The mucous membrane between the two also appears abnormally thick and succulent, and the bowel-wall as a whole is thickened and contorted. It is a cylinder-celled carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 85.) 36.108. Carcinoma of the Sigmoid Flexure. Stricture. Hunterian. E. 29. A portion of the sigmoid flexure slit open, showing a hard thick ulcer forming a ring round the bowel, about 2 cm. wide, and tightly constricting it. Quite a small tumour. Cylinder-celled carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 76.) 36.109. Carcinoma of the Sigmoid Flexure. Tight Stric- ture. Dilatation of the Bowel above. Hunterian. R. 30. A small ring-like growth, with fungating ulcerated surface pro- jecting into the calibre of the bowel. There has been marked shrinking, so that the tumour is quite small, and looks especially so by comparison with the greatl}' dilated bowel above it. Cylinder- celled carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 77.)

936 HUNTER!AN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. finely laminated nearly pure calcium carbonate. The outer parts are very pale brown in colour, the central darker. 53.171. Calcium Carbonate Calculus. Horse (?). Hunterian. A large dark brown calculus of calcium carbonate in coarse granules, fairly compactly agglutinated together, round a small nucleus of laminated calcium carbonate. The stone consists of two parts united by a comparatively narrow neck. The larger is a flattened spherical mass 9'5 cm. in diameter, the smaller a rather irregular mass (partly cut away), about the size of a pigeon's egg. Probably from a horse. 53.172. Calcium Carbonate Calculus. Renal. Horse. Hunterian. A large "kidnej' stone from a mare." A long curved irregularly lobulated mass of calcium carbonate—part granulated, part dense— measuring 14"5 cm. in length in a straight line, and in thickness from about 2 to 5 cm. 53.173. Calcium Carbonate Calculi. Hog. Hunterian. A small bottle full of " stones from a hog's bladder." Little globular bodies from the size of a mustard seed to that of a pea, the small ones pale brown, the large ones dark brown in colour, with a pearly lustre externally. They are very hard and are composed of calcium carbonate and organic matter. Very like human prostatic calculi. 53.174. Calcium Carbonate Calculi. Hog. Hunterian. Another of the same. 53.175. Calcium Carbonate Calculi. Hog. Hunterian. Some more of the same lying loose in a small box. Of the Rarer Urinary Calculi—cystin, xanthin, calcium phosphate, oirostealith, and fibrin—the museum contains no specimens.

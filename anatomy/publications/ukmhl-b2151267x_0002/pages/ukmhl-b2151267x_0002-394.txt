The villi are well preserved; the fibrous tissue composing them is less cellular and more formed and dense than it vi^ould nor- mally be in the fifth month. The blood-vessels are very few and small. The intervillous spaces contain only a little brown debris. The decidua here and there shows infiltration by small round cells. There are traces of necrosis in the decidua and round-celled infiltrations. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 144.) 49.68. Portion of a Placenta forming a Fleshy Mole retained in the Uterus. Subinvolution.

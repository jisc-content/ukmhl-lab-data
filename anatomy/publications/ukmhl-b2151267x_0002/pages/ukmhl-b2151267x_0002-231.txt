INVERSION OF THE UTERUS. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. 45.1. Enlargement of the Clitoris. Hmderian. CC. IGa. The external and internal parts of generation of a girl approaching puberty, showing the clitoris and its prepuce so large as to resemble the corresponding organ in the male. The rest of the external and the internal organs are not fully developed, but otherwise perfectly normal. II. Injuries and Displacements of the Female Genitals. 45.2. Inversion of the Uterus. Himterian. CC. 60a. The uterus and vagina, laid open from behind, showing the above. The body of the uterus, which is about the size of the normal organ in the unimpregnated condition, is very completely inverted. The doubling is about the level of the os internum, and the inverted fundus reaches to the level of the os externum. The condition is evidently of old standing, but there is no history of the case, and the cause cannot be made out. The cervix is very greatly dilated and its walls thinned; the point at which it meets the vagina is by no means distinct. The Fallopian tubes dip down into the hollow of the inversion, being pressed close together, and even now, when the uterus has been laid open, they are only about 5 mm. apart. The internal orifices are not visible. 45.3. Partial Inversion of the Uterus by a Myoma. Hunter Ian. CG. 95^. This specimen is most conveniently described as consisting of an upper part, which is laid open in front, and a lower part. The upper part, owing to the inversion, shows three laj'ers ; the outer consists of the vagina, which is partly inverted into itself and greatly stretched. Enclosed in this is the second layer, consisting of vaginal wall and cervix, inverted and turned up round the body of the uterus which forms the centre of the mass. The upper part of the body of the uterus seems to be stretched and thinned out, but preserves to a considerable extent its natural relations to the

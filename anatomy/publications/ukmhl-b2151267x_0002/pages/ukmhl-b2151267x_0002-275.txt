GENERA TION. RA BBITS. 657 a bit of decidua, nearly as in the human subject, attached to the mica, to which the above-named preparation is fixed before. No appearance of foetus as yet." 4-7.13. Uterus of Rabbit on the "Eighth Day" after Coitus. Hunterian. 00. 20. " Portion of the uterus of the rabbit, opened ; attached to blue paper; on the eighth day : it showed the foetus, which was made visible by dropping distilled vinegar on it, but is now not visible from the opposite white ground." 47.14. Part of Uterus with Ovum of Rabbit. "Ninth Day." Hunterian. 00. 22. " One of the cells of the uterus, in which is enclosed ovum of the ninth day, opened : the foetus amazingly increasedâ€”to four or five times (perhaps ten times) its first visible size ; the cavity of the ovum very large, and full of ropy transparent fluid." The embryo hangs down by a portion of membrane. It is about 2 mm. long, strongly curved forwards, and the head is distinguishable, and the tiny buds for the limbs. 47.15. Ovary and Part of Uterus with Ovum of Rabbit. " Ninth Day." Hunterian. 00. 23. " Ditto, with Fallopian tube, and a section of ovarium; the corpora lutea, in a side or vertical section, evidently hollow in the centre." The embryo slightly larger than in the preceding. 47.16. Ovary and Part of Uterus of Rabbit. " Eleventh Day." Hunterian. 00. 25. " A portion of the uterus. Fallopian tube, and ovarium of the rabbit, on the eleventh day : the foetus seen lying in its cell, and still enclosed in its amnion, proportionably larger than in No. 24 (wanting), but even now the navel-string is hardly visible; the corpora lutea, very large, and project much above the surface of the ovarium, which is now very rough." The embryo lies on its right side, on what afterwards becomes the placenta. Compare No. 269 in Series 48.

PHOSPHATIC CALCULI. 9W *53.137. Two Mixed Phosphate Calculi—from one Bladder. Hiinterian. The larger stone is very similar to the preceding, but slightly smaller; flattened on one end. The smaller is of oval shape flattened on the side which lay in apposition with the flattened surface of the other. Both consist of a small nucleus of uric acid and calcium oxalate enclosed in a thick shell of mixed phosphates, very soft, chalky and fusible—for the most part triple. {Hunterian Plate XII., figs. 4 and 5.) 53.138. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian, A calculus of irregularly oval shape, composed of fusible phosphates of very loose texture, mixed with some calcium oxalate and uric acid (or ammonium urate) round a fairly large nucleus of calcium oxalate with traces of uric acid. 53.139. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus of rounded tetrahedral shape, with nucleus of uric acid and calcium oxalate. The phosphates of very close texture, soft and chalky, and finely laminated. 53.140. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a stone almost identical in size, shape, and composition with the preceding. *53.141. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A stone nearly as large as a hen's egg, of uneven oval shape, being straighter on one side, consisting of white and grey layers of mixed phosphates round a small calculus of granular mixed uric acid and calcium oxalate, with nucleus of urate of ammonium. {Hunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 1.) *53.142. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus larger than a hen's egg, of irregular shape. It has as a nucleus an oval uric acid stone as large as a marble, placed eccentrically. Alongside this, occupying the centre, is a mass of

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATAIAHIUE. 878 *52.74. Oat Seed Concretion. Hunterian. Half of a calculus of similar composition ; of irregular ovoid shape, measuring 7 by 4 cm. It is heavier than the preceding from the presence of numerous narrow strata containing a considerable amount of inorganic matter mixed with the hairs ; this is principally fusible earthy phosphates. {Huiiferiuv Plalc III., figs. 1 and 2.) 52.75. Oat Seed Concretions. Hunterian. Two small concretions cut, the one showing a centre of tough organic matter coated with earthy matter. '^52.76. Oat Seed Concretion. Hunterian. A similar calculus, of small size, cut, showing the centre a fruit stone. [Hunterian Plate IV., figs. 5 and 6.) *52.77. Oat Seed Concretion. HitnteHan. A similar calculus, the size of a chestnut, cut, showing a fruit, stone in the centre. {Hunterian Plate IV., figs. 3 and 4.) 52.78. Oat Seed Concretions. Hunterian. Two similar concretions, cut, differing from the last in being apparently of the same composition, viz., oat seed hairs right to the centre. Very light, there being almost no earthy matter. *52.79. Oat Seed Concretion. Hunterian. Half of a similar calculus, of larger size and markedly faceted; the centre a fruit stone. {Hunterian Plate IV., figs. 7 and 8.) *52.80. Oat Seed Concretion. Hunterian. Half of a similar calculus, having several layers and a very dense shell of earthy matter, faceted and polished in parts, apparently having been one of several in the same subject. Much heavier than the preceding calculi. {Hunterian Plate III., figs. 3 and 4.)

THE PLACENTA. 709 pipe in the spermatic or hypogastric vein, so ready a passage is there reciprocally between the cells of the placenta and the uterine veins. It is as much reciprocal and much more largely open than between the corpus spongiosum and the veins of the penis. " From all these experiments and observations, which have been often repeated and diligently attended to with no other desire than to discover truth, it seems incontestible that the human placenta, like that of the quadruped, is composed of two distinct parts, though blended together, viz., an umbilical, which may be considered as a part of the foetus, and an uterine, which belongs to the mother; that each of these parts has its peculiar system of arteries and veins, and its peculiar circulation, receiving blood by its arteries and returning it by its veins; that the circulation through these two parts of the placenta differs in the following manner: in the umbilical portion the arteries terminate in the veins by a continuity of canal, whereas in the uterine portion there are intermediate cells into which the arteries termin- ate, and from which the veins begin. 'â€¢Though the placenta be completely filled with any injection thrown into the uterine vessels, none of the wax finds its way into any of the umbilical vessels; and in the same manner fluids injected into the umbilical vessels never can be pushed into the uterine, except by rupture or transudation. " The first time (in the year 1743) that I injected the vein of the navel-string while the placenta adhered to the uterus, in separating these two parts it was evident that the injection had nowhere passed further than the placenta, except at one place, where a small convoluted vessel (no doubt an artery) was traced, distinctly filled with wax, some little way into the substance of the uterus; but upon examination it was evident that there was extravasation in that part of the placenta, and by many trials I know that water, or any fluid fit for transudation, thrown into the umbilical arteries or veins, readily gets into the cellular cavities of the placenta, and thence into the vessels, especially the veins, of the uterus." The above passages give a beautifully accurate and clear account of the relationship between the foetal and the maternal circula- tions, and taking them along with those quoted under Nos. 48.83 and 48.123 of the anatomy of the placenta, so far as was possible in the state of science at the time they were written. The words " blood-cells" have been interpolated twice, because, though it is clear from the description and from the specimens that William

480 HUNTElilAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 36.38. Portion of the Colon from the preceding Case. Removed post mortem two years later. Stricture at the Sigmoid Flexure. Hunterian. R. 43. It is about 20 cm. long, slit open and laid flat, and is said to be from the neighbourhood of the sigmoid flexure. The upper part is very wide, 10 cm. in circumference, but narrows like a funnel to a tight stricture measuring only 2 cm., below which it widens to 5 cm. The upper part is thickened, and near the stricture the mucous membrane is wrinkled, superficially eroded, and, in places, fissured, as if torn in opening and flattening out. Its appearance suggests that it is a cicatricial stricture following gangrene and shedding of a portion of bowel. The stricture explains the " colic complaints" described in the history under No. 36.36. 36.39. Prolapse of the Anus. Hunterian. R. 52a. Lower part of the rectum and the anus, showing the above. The anus, which is surrounded by external piles, is considerably dilated, and a mass of oedematous-looking mucous membrane projects slightly through it. IV. Changes due to Inflammatory Disease of the Intes- tines AND Peritoneum. (a) Acute Peritonitis, and Fibrous Bands and Adhesions resulting therefrom. 36.40. Peritonitis. Inflammation of the Intestines. Hunterian. P. 84. A piece of " inflamed jejunum " from a case of intestinal obstruc- tion (Nos. 36.44-36.4-5). When fresh it was placed in "distilled vinegar," to fix the blood in the vessels. The areas where the coils of bowel were in contact appeared more hyperaemic. On the free surfaces and along the lines of contact there was a deposition of fibrin. Compare tubercular peritonitis specimens. The colour has faded now, and the specimen shows very little.

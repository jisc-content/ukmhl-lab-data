567 THE PENIS. bristle in it), flattened dorso-ventrally, the central arteries of the corpora cavernosa and dorsal vein (also with bristles in them), and the thickness of the strong white fibrous sheath of the corpora cavernosa and septum between them. 4-2.78. Transverse Section of the Corpora Cavernosa. Hunterian. BB. 11. A similar section from a penis injected black by the veins. The black corresponds to the blood spaces of the erectile tissues of the organ. The arteries, trabeculae, septum, and sheaths being white, show well by contrast. The central artery of each corpus cavernosum is readily distinguishable. 42.79. Trabeculae of the Corpora Cavernosa. Hunterian. BB. 18. " The corpora cavernosa having been injected red, the cavernous substance is mostly dug out, to show ligamentous frena passing from the sides of the cavernosa, to prevent their being irregularly dis- tended or beyond their capacity." 42.80. The Corpora Cavernosa, Dorsal Artery, Dorsal Vein, and Nerves of the Penis. Hunterian. BB. 39. The corpora cavernosa injected black by the veins, and one side afterwards cut out to show the spaces and the strong transverse trabeculae and finer irregular fibrous network, which make up the erectile tissue. The dorsal artery is injected red, and the nerves are visible as pale yellow streaks running along the dorsum external to the artery and curving round to the lower side. Compare No. 42.82. 42.81. The Septum Pectiniforme of the Corpora Cavernosa. Hunterian. BB. 39a. " The corpora cavernosa injected black : on the right side the injection is dug out next the crura, showing a complete tendinous septum ; on the left side it is dug out next the glans, showing the injection passing through the slits of communication."

"A miscarriage about two months; substance condensed, and recently coagulated blood appearing on the outside." The embryo is about the size of one of two months' growth, but is deformed. The envelope of the conception is very dense, and had evidently lain a long time in the uterus. "A blight occasioning a mis- carriage happens about the eighth week of real age, and they are excluded from the uterus commonly about the third month." (William Hunter's Midwifery Lectures, MS. R.C.S.Eng., 42, c. 31.) 49.60. An Abortion not long retained in the Uterus. Hunterian. RR. 258. A thick mass of comparatively fresh blood clot, with traces of the membranes but no embryo in the cavity. Somewhat similar to No. 49.49. 49.61. An Abortion not long retained in the Uterus. Hunterian. RR. 259. Longitudinal section of a comparatively fresh miscarriage. The foetal membranes and chorionic villi are well preserved. A quan- tity of soft laminated blood clot lies between the chorion and the decidua reflexa. No embryo. 49.62. An Abortion containing a Malformed Embryo. Hunterian. RR. 260. Another example of an abortion retained in the uterus long after the death of the embryo. As is often the case, the embryo is malformed: head and body form one smooth mass, with four little formless buds representing the limbs. Compare Series 48, Section III., Development of the Ovum, and Series 50, Monsters. 49.63. An Abortion containing a Malformed Embryo. Hunterian. RR. 262. Similar to the preceding.

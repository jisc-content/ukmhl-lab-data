Hunterian. URIC ACID CALCULI. 53.28. Uric Acid Calculus. 903 53. 27. Uric Acid Calculus. Renal. Hunferian. A stone about the size and somewhat the shape of a kidney bean. "From Mr. Hume's right kidney." Compare No. 41.49. He is said to have died of " gout in the stomach." A boxful of fragments, of various shapes and sizes, of uric acid calculi. They are of pale buff colour, and have rounded edges as if they had been partly dissolved at some time. (6) Calculi consisting principally of Uric Acid, hut shoiuing distinct Traces of Calcium Oxalate either in the form of a Nucleus or mixed xuith the Uric Acid. They are practically uric acid calculi. There are 30 stones of this species in the collection. 53.29. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. An oval stone about the size of a hen's egg, consisting of uric acid with a distinct trace of calcium oxalate throughout. Its substance is partly granulated, partly dense and in fine laminae, of various shades of brown. Its exterior has a rough water-worn appearance as if it had been undergoing solution. 53.30. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A somewhat larger stone, presenting characters almost identical with the preceding. There is a trace of oxalates throughout, and the nucleus contains urate of ammonium. *53.31. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. An oval stone rather smaller than the preceding, cut across its long axis. The nucleus is a small flattened stone of compact laminated uric acid placed eccentrically. The bulk of the stone has been added around one side and the ends of the nucleus, the free side being hardly added to at all. Nearly all of the stone outside the nucleus is in the form of coarse granules adhering closely to one

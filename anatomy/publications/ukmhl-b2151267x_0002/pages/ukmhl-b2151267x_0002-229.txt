611 THE MAMMARY GLANDS. 44.58. The Mammary Glands of a Suckling Bitch. Hunterian. DD. 10a. "Two of the mammae from a bitch of the bull-dog size, some weeks after suckling : tubuli are not quite so large as in woman, nor has the mercury run sufficiently minutely to fill the follicles; they are beautifully radiated, however, and several absorbent vessels have been filled from the cavity of the tubes near the nipple; those run between the skin and mamma upwards, in the direction of left subclavian." In turpentine. 44.59. Section of the Mamma of a Goat. Hunterian. G. 28. " The breast of the West Indian goat; it was first injected with mercury, then dried, now cut open. There is but one tubulus lactiferus the size of one's finger, which opens into a kind of cavernous substance, probably follicular on the outside." In turpentine.

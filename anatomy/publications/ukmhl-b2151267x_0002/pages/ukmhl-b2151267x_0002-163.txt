545 TUMOURS OF THE KIDNEY. 41.50. Cystic Transformation of the Kidneys. Hunferian. X 88. " One half of the right, and of the left kidney, from a man who died in the Westminster Hospital." Of the same nature as the three preceding specimens. 41.51. Cystic Transformation of the Kidney. â€” A kidney split open showing the cortex riddled with thin walled cysts filled with brownish material, which is tough, hyaline, and structureless under the microscope, and is probably the coagulated contents of the cysts. (c) Carcinoma and Sarcoma of the Kidney. 41.52. Carcinoma of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 8la. One half of a kidney which has been transformed into a large solid tumour. A small corner at the upper end appears normal, the rest of the mass is tumour. The main mass, occupying the middle region of the kidney, is to a large extent necrotic. In the lower end, portions of renal tissue (medullary pj'ramids) are visible in the midst of living tumour tissue, which appears to be infiltrating them. The new growth has also infiltrated the capsule in places, and has almost obliterated the pelvis of the kidney. Microscopic examination shows a very mixed structure; some parts certainly suggest carcinoma, but it is so altered by time, that no definite diagnosis can be given. It is clearly of a malignant nature. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 99.)

BEZUAIiS. 885 52.101. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A large calculus, cut; of blunt oval shape, light greenish-brown colour, a good deal chipped, but polished where the old external surface remains. In section it is seen to be composed of very fine laminae, which vary in colour from a pale greenish-brown to a very dark brown. It has had a nucleus about the size and shape of a cherry stone, which is now absent. It is about as hard as sealing- wax, very brittle; the laminae readily split asunder, and it melts and burns in very much the same manner as sealing wax, and with a somewhat similar odour. Sinks easily in water. 52.102. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A similar concretion, somewhat smaller, cut across its long axis. It is of rather paler colour than the preceding. It has a minute nucleus—about the size of a carraway seed—of some hard, tough, apparently vegetable matter. 52.103. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A much smaller calculus, of rounded cubical shape, divided, show- ing its nucleus—a small pebble. Around the nucleus the lamination is less distinct than in the outer parts, and there is a tendency to radiate crystalline formation. 52.104. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A similar calculus, cut. There is no distinct nucleus, but the centre is composed of irregular masses of resin agglutinated together. Outside this it becomes finely laminated in the usual way. 52.105. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a similar concretion of oval shape, with a large nucleus consisting of a mass of loosely felted animal hairs and vegetable fibres. The layers of resinous matter next the nucleus show a tendency to radiate crystallization. 52.106. Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A small concretion very similar to No. 52.100, the nucleus wanting.

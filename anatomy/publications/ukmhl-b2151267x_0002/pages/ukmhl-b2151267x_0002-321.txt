703 TEE AMNION, CHORION, AND DECIDUA. 48.120. Amnion, Chorion, and Decidua. Hunterian. RK. 173, A portion of the uterus, with the membranes partly detached: shows their condition at a late stage of gestation. The decidua is split into two layers which hang down over the upper part of the specimen. They are considerably thicker and more opaque than the chorion and amnion, which are seen hanging over the lower part of the specimen. 48.121. The Decidua. Hunterian. RR.ni. A portion of the uterus, injected red and black, showing the decidua in an earlier stage, as a thick fleshy membrane containing numerous vessels. 48.122. The Decidua. Hunterian. RR. 174. A portion of the uterus, showing the above in a condition intermediate between the two preceding. Injected coarsely green and red. (C) THE MATURE PLACENTA. 48.123. " A Whole Placenta, injected red and yellow, with a portion of the Membranes preserved." The Decidua. Hunterian. RR. 159. It is injected by the umbilical cord. The decidual covering (decidua serotina) of its outer surface is intact; it is not injected. " When a placenta is finely injected and then steeped, and fre- quently washed in clean water, it is evident that the umbilical injected vessels do not reach even the outer surface of the placenta, but are only seen through a membrane (decidua) which covers all that surface. It is rough and ragged, like the inner surface of the uterus to which it adheres, and by its whiteness becomes very distinct from the vascular injected part of the placenta over which it is spread. It becomes still more distinguishable when the part is put into spirits, which renders it more opaque and whiter. This membrane is an efflorescence or production of the inner membrane of the uterus, and it is analogous to the uterine fungi of quadrupeds. It receives no vessels, demonstrable by the finest

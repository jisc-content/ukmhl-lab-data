794 HCXTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. the posterior two forelegs are not completely fused into one limb. They are united by their inner surfaces, and rolled outwards so that the toes point away from one another. Forms a link between the preceding and the dipygus tetrabrachius. 50. 20. Dipygus Tetrabrachius. Kitten. (Deradelphe.) A kitten with one head, two separate hind (quarters, and four distinct fore legs ; male. This and the seven succeeding specimens, all belonging to the same genus, complete the bridge between the dipygus dibrachius and the syncephalus. As in the former, the head is single (showing traces of doubling only iu the occipital bone); while, as in the latter, the vertebral columns are completely distinct, and the thoraces are united to form a single cavity with two breast surfaces looking forwards and backwards and belonging by halves to each body. The union of the anterior surfaces extends down to a common umbilicus. This specimen shows the general outward characters; No. 22 is skinned and partially dissected to show the arrangement of the vertebral columns and partly doubled occipital bones; and No. 21 shows the two breast surfaces of the thorax and the single heart placed under the front sternum. No. 2.3 shows the base of the skull and the skeleton of the thorax. 50.21. Dipygus Tetrabrachius. Kitten. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. (Deradelphe.) Similar to the preceding. The skin and pectoral muscles have been divided and turned aside from both breast surfaces. The two sterna are split: under the front one lies a well-formed heart; under the posterior one were found the lungs and no trace of a second heart. Contrast the Syncephalic mon- sters, Nos. 50.32 et seq. 50.22. Dipygus Tetrabrachius. Kitten. (Deradelphe.) A similar monstrosity; female. It is skinned and the neck dissected, showing that the vertebral columns are distinct up to the occiput. The occijDital protuberance and the whole head in front of it is single. Evidence of doubling is

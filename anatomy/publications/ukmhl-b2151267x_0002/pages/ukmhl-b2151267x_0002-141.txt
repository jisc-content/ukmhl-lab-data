523 THE KIDNEY. 40. 9. The Cortex and Medulla of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 24. Half of a kidney divided longitudinally, coarsely injected red, showing the above. The cortex, the secreting part of the gland, is much more vascular than the medulla. 4-0.10. The Pelvis and Pyramids of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 31. Half of a kidney and pelvis injected red, and divided longi- tudinally, " showing the vascularity of the organ, but chiefly the nipples or mamillae of the kidney mouthing or pouting into its cavity ; the nipples are the pyramidal tops of the tubular portion, and are perforated by a number of holes, the terminations of the excretory ducts of the kidney." See Nos. 40.22 to 40.26. 40.11. The Pelvis and Pyramids of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 32. Similar to the preceding. 40.12. The Mamillae or Pyramids of the Kidney. Hunteria7i. X. 33. " A portion of human kidney uninjected to show the radiation of the mamillae, as well as their points." It looks as if torn in the line of the excretory tubes, and shows beautifully the manner in which they converge from the broad base in the cortex to the point of the mamilla, where they discharge the urine into the calyces of the pelvis. 40.13. The Pyramids and the Calyces of the Pelvis. Hunterian. X. 34. One half of a foetal kidney injected red; two mamillae (pyra- mids) are seen projecting into the cavity of the pelvis. 40.14. The Pyramids and Pelvis of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 35. Half of a kidney of a young foetus, injected red, showing the above. The lobulation of the organ being still very distinct, it 11. I

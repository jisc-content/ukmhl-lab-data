HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 420 the villi, owing to some disease, is formed in excessive quantity or is not properly shed and accordingly accumulates, giving rise to the condition called furred tongue. In this specimen most of the fur has been scraped off showing the highly vascular papillae, so that the appearance is rather that of a tongue which is cleaning during convalescence. 32.2. Furred Tongue. Hunterian. GG. 34. Tongue, with larynx slit open, cleaned in the centre, but covered with fur at the edges. 32. 3. Macroglossia. Hunterian. GG. 35. " A very large anterior portion of a tongue. It is the superfluous part of a woman's tongue, cut off by Mr. Lambert; did well with the other part." The papillae are greatly hypertrophied, and the cut surface appears to be made up of fibrous trabeculae with wide spaces between themâ€”hypertrophy of the connective tissue with dilatation of the interstitial lymph spaces, which is the usual cause of this condition. IV. Changes due to Inflammatory Disease. 32.4. Chronic Hypertrophy of the Tonsils. Hunterian. GG. 40. The pharynx, soft palate, and tonsils, from before ; the tongue and larynx removed, showing a moderate degree of the above. 32.5. Acute Phlegmonous Ulceration of the Tonsils and Fauces. Quinsy. Hunterian. GG. 41. "An ulcerated tonsil, with the tongue covered with black fur, from a child who died of putrid sore throat. Dr. Hunter says it was perfectly rotten; fingers went through and through." A ragged sloughing surface extends from the left tonsil backwards into the pharynx and downwards towards the larnyx, and has destroyed the left pillar of the fauces, ary-epiglottic fold and edge of the epiglottis, and ulcerated into the larynx.

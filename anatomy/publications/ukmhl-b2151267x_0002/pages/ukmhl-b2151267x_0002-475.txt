EMBRYOLOGY. 857 Model 5. The same parts from an embryo about 1 inch and 2 lines long, about the tenth week {Loc. ciL, fig. 12), in which the female sexual characters are quite decided. The clitoris is large, and projecting like a penis, but the labia majora and minora are quite recognizable as such. Model 6. The same parts from a male embryo about 2 inches long, in the end of the third or beginning of the fourth month (Loc. ■cit., fig. 13), showing the male tj'pe quite decided. The posterior part of the uro-genital sinus has closed by fusion of the two halves ■of the scrotum—a distinct raphe, which is recognizable throughout life, marking the line of fusion; the anterior part (the urethra) is still an open groove on the under side of the penis. Models 7 and 9. The external genitals from female foetuses at the middle of the fifth and beginning of the sixth months respec- tively, showing further stages of their development. The clitoris has ceased growing, and is enveloped in the folds of the labia minora. {Loc. cit., figs 14 and 15.) No. 9 shows the hymen developing at the mouth of the genital orifice. See specimens Nos. 44.4 to 44.9 for •development of these parts from the sixth month of pregnancy onwards. Models 8 and 10. The external genitals from male foetuses at the middle and end of the fourth month respectively, showing further stages of their development. The penis has gone on growing, and the uro-genital cleft has closed completely, forming the tubular urethra right to its point; the skin folds have swelled out into the two pouches of the scrotum ready for the descent of the testicles, for Nwhich see Nos. 42.58 to 42.66.

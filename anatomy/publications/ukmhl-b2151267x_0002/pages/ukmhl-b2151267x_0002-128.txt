HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 510 38.15. Old Dried-in Abscess of the Liver. Calcareous Infiltration. Hunterian. U. 47fl. One of three " cysts from the liver of a patient who died in the London Hospital: they were full of scrophulous matter." One of them, now absent, is described as having contained " purer pus." They are rather larger than walnuts; their walls are of dense fibrous tissue, infiltrated with lime salts, and lined with irregular flakes and masses of fibrinous and calcareous debris. They might be old hydatid cysts, but microscopic examination gave negative result, no trace of booklets or chitinous cyst wall being discovered. 38.16. Old Dried-in Abscess of the Liver. Calcareous Infiltration. Hunterian. U. 47S. Another cyst from the same case as the preceding. Similar, but rather smaller. 38.17. Perihepatitis, secondary to Abscess. Hunterian. U. ild. A portion of the muscle and central tendon of the diaphragm, its abdominal surface covered with a layer of fibrinous exu- dation ; from the same case as the preceding. Some black pigment on the pleural surface seems to point to pleuritic adhesions also. 38.18. Perihepatitis, secondary to Abscess, Hunterian. U. 47c. Another portion of diaphragm from the same case. There is a fibrinous deposit on both sides of the diaphragm; that on the abdominal side appears thicker and firmer, as if partly organized. 38.19. Perihepatitis, secondary to Abscess. Fibrinous Exudation on the Pleura. Hunterian. N. 47/. Portions of the liver and diaphragm from the same case, glued together by fibrinous exudation. As in the preceding specimen the pleural surface is also thickly coated with fibrin. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. V., PI. I., fig. 1.)

926 HUNTElilAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 53.128. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. A small spherical stone of similar composition coated thinly with phosphates. 53.129. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. An oblong calculus nearly as large as a pigeon's egg, uncut; most of its exterior is greyish-white from the presence of a thin shell of mixed phosphates; but where this is imperfect it is nearly black, and made up of low rounded tubercles, smooth, polished and trans- lucent, which consist of pure calcium oxalate and are very hard. 53.130. Calculus of Calcium Oxalate, Ammonium Urate^ and Phosphates. Hunterian. A calculus of flattened oval shape, rather larger than a pigeon's egg, consisting of a spherical calcium oxalate calculus about the size of a marble, with urate of ammonium nucleus, enclosed in a thick shell of pale uric acid with a considerable amount of urate of ammonium, and lastly a thin outer coat of mixed phosphates. *53.131. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. Half of a small oval calculus, consisting of calcium oxalate mixed with some uric acid round a nucleus of uric acid, covered on one side by a mass of phosphates. [Hunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 8.) 53.132. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. From Urethra. Hunterian.. " A stone which stuck more than a week in the urethra in a Smithfield boy. 1746." A stone of rather irregular oblong shape, measuring 18 by 13 by 6 mm. It consists of a shell of mixed phos- phates with traces of uric acid (or urate of ammonium) enclosing a harder substance which is principally calcium oxalate; uncut. *53.133. Calculus of Uric Acid, Calcium Oxalate, and Phosphates. Hunterian. Half of a spherical calculus, 2>1 cm. in diameter, with its outer layers broken away at one side. The main part of it is a

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 894 52.142. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. A similar concretion, cut, and the laminae separated to show its structure. 52.143. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian, A small concretion similar to the preceding, broken, showing the crystalline structure very nicely. The crystals in some of the laminae are from 5 to 7 mm. long. They radiate from the nucleus,, which is a small piece of twig. 52.144. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. A small heart-shaped concretion, cut, and the laminae separated. 52.145. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. A similar calculus of irregular heart shape, cut. An extremely hard stone. 52.146. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. An irregular mass of calcium phosphate concretion formed in the typical way about several centres, divided. The texture of the stone is unusually open, and shows the crystalline structure very clearly. 52.147. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. A concretion about the size and shape of a hazel nut, divided, showing the nucleus a small dark stone. 52.148. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. Two small dark brown concretions, one broken showing its cry- stalline structure. The dark colour is only on the exterior, and is due to a coating of organic matter. 52.149. Phosphate of Calcium Concretion. Hunterian. An irregular concretion of the same class. In shape and colour it suggests a small unwashed kidney potato, a resemblance decidedly heightened by the end of the twig which forms its nucleus projecting from one end.

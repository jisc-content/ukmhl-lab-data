EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 770 the OS internum forms the apex). At each corner is a hole, the two upper corresponding to the Fallopian tubes, the lower to the os internum. Behind is seen the placental area with chorionic villi projecting through the decidua serotina. In front the decidua vera is cut to show the cavity of the uterus, and the decidua reflexa enclosing the ovum. The outside of the decidua vera is beset with fine threadsâ€”remains of the tubular uterine glands. An unusually perfect specimen, and one which has not undergone changes from long retention in the uterus. 49.45. An Abortion in the Third Month in Section. Hunterian. EE. 228. A similar specimen, the decidua vera reflected, and the front of the reflexa and foetal membranes removed, showing the cavity of the ovum; the stump of the umbilical cord ligatured, the embryo gone. 49.46. An Abortion containing an Embryo of about Eight Weeks. Hunterian. EE. 279. A similar specimen, but with the decidua vera mostly cut away, and part of the placenta dissected to show the villi of the chorion. The body of the embryo remains, apparently of not more than eight weeks' growth. The time at which it was shed is unknown; William Hunter's opinion was that abortions at three months were mostly of this age, three to four weeks elapsing between the death of the embryo and its extrusion from the uterus. Compare under No. 49.59. 49.47. Decidua from an Abortion. Hunterian. EE. 285. A decidua similar to No. 49.45, but a good deal torn and the ovum gone, having in all probability been voided first and the decidua afterwards. 49.48. Decidua from an Abortion. Hunterian. EE. 286. A portion of a similar decidua. Thicker and fleshier than the preceding.

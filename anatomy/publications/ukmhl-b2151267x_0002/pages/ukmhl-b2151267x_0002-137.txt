519 NEMATODA; ROUND WORMS. wine measure. The external coat of the cyst was membranous, with some appearance of muscular fibres; the internal coat was strong and ligamentous, verj' much like that of steatomatoiis tumours. The fluid, which was as thin as water or serum and not coagulable by heat, contained in this cyst, was enclosed, if I may so express it, in a cyst of its own; I mean by that, that the coagulable part of the lymph had formed a complete cyst of a semi-trans- parent gelatinous substance in some places, and white and opaque in others, but firm enough to have been taken out entire."

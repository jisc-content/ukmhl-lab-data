TUBERCULAR ULCERS OF THE COLON. 491 36.90. Tubercular Ulcers of the Colon. Hunterian. R. 39c?. A large piece of colon from the same case, showing a number of superficial ulcers. 36.91. Tubercular Ulcers of the Colon. Huntericm. R. 39. A portion of colon, injected, laid open, showing a number of ulcers with spots of injection appearing in their floor, like extra- vasations from eroded vessels. 36.92. Extensive Tubercular Ulcers of the Colon. Stric- ture. Htmterian. R. 25. A portion of colon "from the dissecting room," laid open, showing two segments, about 6-5 and 4 cm. long respectively, in which the whole circumference of the wall of the gut is thickened, contracted, and internally ulcerated. The intervening segment of bowel is unaff'ected. The ulceration is tubercular. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 95.) 36.93. "Former Ulceration of the Colon, Healed into Stricture." Hunterian. R. 25a. Probably an old tubercular ulcer. 36. 94. Cicatricial Stricture of the Sigmoid Flexure. Hunterian. R. Q\. A portion of the sigmoid flexure and the left half of the uterus, with a glass rod passed through a very short and tight stricture of the intestine. The stricture extends about 2 cm. It is fairly hard, but there is no tumour, its diameter being only 2-5 cm. When laid open it was found to be entirely cicatricial. It was sewn up again. The left broad ligament and ovary are attached to the bowel by a mass of fibrous adhesions. Below is a large broken-down lymphatic gland. Microscopic examination gave nega- tive results, as the tissue is much degenerated. Most probably tubercular. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 91.) II. G

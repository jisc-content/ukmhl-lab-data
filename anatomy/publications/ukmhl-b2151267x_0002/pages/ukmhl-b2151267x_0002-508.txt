890 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOUUE. and weighed wheu whole above 14 lbs. It consisted of triple phosphates (magnesium and ammonium), with some phosphate of lime and layers "of the tuft of hairs at the extremity of the oat. A very small quantity of sulphate of lime is also scattered through the concretion." 52.122. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Htmtcnan. A similar concretion, uncut, of flattened spherical shape, nearl}' as large as the preceding. A number of the outer laminae are imperfect. 52.123. Triple Phosphate Concretion. ILunterkin. Fragments of a small tetrahedral calculus of the same class as the preceding, broken, and the thicker laminae separated. Each of the separated laminae can be seen to consist of a large number of very fine laminae. Nucleus absent. *52.124. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A small concretion (only 'I'l by '1 by 2i- inches) of flattened oval shape, cut, ground and varnished. {Hunterian Plate VI., fig. 2.) 52.125. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A similar calculus, half cut through, then broken. These small calculi are mostly of a pale limestone colour. In composition they are like the large ones. 52.126. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. Another of the same, cut, with a small pebble for a nucleus. *52.127. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A small concretion cut and varnished. Harder than stones of this class usually are ; mostly triple phosphates. Nucleus a small pebble. {Hunterian Plate VI., fig. 5.) 52.128. Triple Phosphate Concretion. A small spherical concretion, cut. Hunterian.

705 THE MATURE PLACENTA. considerable increase of thickness, and subsides again when the fluid escapes. This cellular receptacle in the placenta cannot be completely filled after it has been parted from the uterus, because then the fluid we may by any contrivance throw in will be dis- charged at innumerable orifices on the outer surface of the placenta; but while it remains attached to the uterus, all the cells may be easily and completely filled by injecting any fluid into the arteries or veins of the uterus. These vessels, and these only, have a demonstrable communication with the spongy cells of the placenta, which receive the maternal blood from the arteries of the uterus, and give it back into the veins of that part. Both these vessels pass in the decidua; and the larger branches of both with little or no ramification, terminate abruptly in the cells." (See, for foetal portion of the placenta, Nos. 48.126 to 48.134; for maternal (intervillous) blood spaces, Nos. 48.99, and 48.135 to 48.150; especially Nos. 48.135, 48.140, and 48.146 ; also dissections Nos. 48.153 to 48.158.) 48.124. The Placenta. Hunterian. EE. 162. "A placenta, the arteries injected of a lake colour, and the large branches of the vein white"; partly unravelled on the outer surface. The chorion has also been dissected away from part of its inner surface, exposing the spongy "cellular" substance in the cavities of which the maternal blood circulates. "Placenta injected black; being partly unravelled, and the decidua partly adhering, giving it a motley appearance," only the foetal vessels being injected, and the decidua remaining white. 48.126. The Placenta, partly Unravelled, showing Foetal " A placenta injected black and red; and in some places there is no injection, from small lobules being tied by a ligature before the injection; the whole has a varied motley appearance."

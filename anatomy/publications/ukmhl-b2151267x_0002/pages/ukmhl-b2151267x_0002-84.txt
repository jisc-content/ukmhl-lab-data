466 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. I. Congenital Defects and Malformations. 36.1. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 55. "A diverticulum or caecum in the jejunum of a man hanged at Tyburn." The " Diverticulum Ilei" is correctly described in Dr. Hunter's lectures ; " jejunum " is therefore probably an error ; the appearance of the gut indicates that the diverticulum was situated very far down in the jejunum, if not in the ileum. These diverticula occur from two to four feet from the ileo-colic valve, originating from a persistence of the vitello-intestinal duct (duct of the embryonic yolk sac). In the specimen, the two ends of bowel and their mesentery are tied together above, with the diverticulum hanging down from the free edge of the bowel. It is about 9 cm. long and 3 cm. in diameter (much the same as the bowel), and the end is constricted to a little knob, which appears to be cystic. It has no mesentery, but a cord can be traced from the mesentery across the bowel, and running down it on one side. 36.2. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 55a. A portion of the intestine hanging by its mesentery, showing a diverticulum of the same nature as the preceding projecting from its side. It is about the same width as the bowel, and about as long as it is wide. 36.3. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 56. A portion of the intestine distended and dried, showing a diverticulum about 5 cm. long and of varying diameter, from 4 to 12 mm., almost moniliform. It rises from the bowel beside the insertion of the mesentery, and runs obliquely from it, having at first a small mesentery of its own. Then it is free for about 3 cm. and its end is attached to the mysentery about 1'5 cm. from the intestine, forming a loop which might readily have become a cause of strangulation of a loop of bowel. It enters the intestine obliquely, and, as can be seen by looking in at the upper end of the specimen, there is a sort of valve over its orifice.

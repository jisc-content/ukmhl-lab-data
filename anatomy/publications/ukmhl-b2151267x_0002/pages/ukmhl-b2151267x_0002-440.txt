HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 822 continuous at the edges with the skin. It is surrounded by a narrow circlet of hair. The vertebral canal is also open and laid riat down to the sacrum. Its floor is covered by thin membrane, which "shows nerves but no spinal marrow." The head is thrown strongly back ; there is practically no neck, the hairs of the scalp passing down between the shoulders ; the vertebral canal is thereby greatlj' shortened. 50.80. Anencephalia and Amyelia. Human. EunUrian. (Anencephale.) A similar foetus; female. The retroflexion and shortening of the cerebro-spinal tract are very marked 50.81. Anencephalia and Spina Bifida. Human. Hunteyian. MM. 4. (Derencephale.) A male foetus, apparently about seven months, showing a similar condition. The base of the skull is covered with a sac "like a production of pia mater, which contained a fluid." The spinal canal is open and laid flat to the lower dorsal I'egion. In the lumbar and sacral regions it has been dissected, .showing a well-formed cauda equina. The retroflexion in the upper parts is very marked. The eyes, which are very prominent even for this condition, occupy the summit of the head. There is also a double harelip. 50.82. Anencephalia. Human. Hunterian. MM. I. (Derencephale.) "The head of a monstrous child; everything above the eye.s, that is, all the cranium, wanting, and consequently no brain." The top of the head is almost entirely skin-covered, which has allowed the cranium to be removed from below without destroying the soft parts. See next specimen. 50.83. Skull of Anencephalic Human Monster. Hunterian. MM. 2. Skull of the preceding, dissected. All the squamous bones form- ing the vault of the skull were completely absent; the base forms a flat surface level with the eyes. The condylar processes of the occipital bone approach but do not quite meet one another behind

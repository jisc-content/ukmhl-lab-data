The Oesophagus of the Turtle. Hunterian. 0. 6. A portion of the oesophagus and stomach of a turtle, showing the former studded, especially in its upper part, with strong thick villi with hard points, from 1 to 2 cm. in length and 2 to 5 mm. in diameter at their bases, the points all directed towards the stomach. They become fewer and shorter, and gradually disappear towards the stomach.

Hunterian. 0. 7. Upper half of the above, similar to the preceding, but the villi are longer and not so hard.

Lower half of the preceding, showing the disappearance of the villi in the lower part of the oesophagus and the transition to the soft gasti'ic mucous membrane. 33.33. The Oesophagus of the Turtle.

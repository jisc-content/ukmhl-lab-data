The lower end of the stomach and part of the duodenum dis- tended with spirit, hardened and then opened above and below to show the pyloric orifice with its fold of mucous membrane and sphincter intact. The entrance of the common bile duct into the duodenum is also seen with a bristle passed through it. The character of the mucous membrane is very different on the two sides of the orifice, the gastric being honeycombed with glands, the duodenal covered with villi. Compare No. 33.27. 33.25.

The lesser end of the stomach and part of the duodenum distended, hardened in spirit and laid open, showing the fold of the pylorus looking deeper and thinner than usual. 33.27. The Mucous Membrane about the Pyloric Orifice. Hunterian. 0. 36. The lower end of the stomach and beginning of the duodenum injected red and laid open, showing the change in the character of the mucous membrane at the pylorus, that of the stomach being- thicker and honeycombed with tubular glands, that of the duodenum also containing tubular glands, but of another kind, and being covered Avith villi. In the duodenum are seen a number of the little papillae which belong to the compound acino-tubular glands of the duodenum, called Brunner's glands. They are peculiar to the duodenum.

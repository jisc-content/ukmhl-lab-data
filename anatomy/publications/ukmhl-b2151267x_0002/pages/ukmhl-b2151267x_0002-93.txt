"A child at birth." There is a deficiency of the diaphragm, through which several coils of the intestines and part of the liver have passed into the right side of the thorax. The lower ribs and half of the sternum are preserved, and show the relations of parts. The hole in the diaphragm, as in the preceding, seems to be the outer arch, as the hernia has passed up in the fossa between the spine and posterior ribs. The liver is almost cut in two, only a flexible fibrous band uniting the two lobes, which seems to indicate that the displacement had existed from a very early period of foetal life, and the parts of the viscus in the thorax and in the abdomen had continued growing, while the, constricted region remained nearly stationarj^ A very similar foetus is described as having been dissected by Dr. George Macaulay (colleague of Dr. Hunter in the Lying-in Hospital) and Dr. Hunter in 1754. The figure is almost identical in appearance with this specimen. {Med. Obs. and Inq., Vol. II., p. 27, PI. II. and III.) {h) The Com])lication8 of Hernia. 36.26. Strangulated Hernia. Hunterian.

Inside are seen the omentum and two ends of bowel ; outside a mass of omentum, loaded with fat and enclosing a loop of intestine. The neck of the sac is very narrow, and grips the contents very tightly. There is a fibrinous deposit on the peri- toneum lining the abdominal wall, and about the neck of the sac and loop of intestine. 36.27. Strangulated Hernia. Gangrene and Rupture of the Intestine.

496 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 36.110. Carcinoma of the Sigmoid Flexure. Hunterian. R. 24. A very bulky tumour filling up the concavity of the loop. The bowel is opened round the convexity; its lumen is very much narrowed, and its walls thickened and ulcerated internally. Micro- scopically the growth appears to be a carcinoma; the tissues are very much degenerated. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 96.) 36. 111. Carcinoma of the Upper Part of the Rectum. Hunterian. li. 53, The rectum and lower part of the intestines slit open, showing a rounded tumour situated about the top of the rectum, ulcerated internally, and forming a tight stricture. In structure it is a cylinder-celled carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 83.) Formerly described as " ulceration with stricture of the rectum. (Case, Dr, Hunter's.)" 36.112. Carcinoma of the Rectum. Infiltration of the Recto-Vaginal Septum. Hunterian. R. 54. A large hard tumour forming a ring all round the rectum, and infiltrating the recto-vaginal septum. It is laid open behind show- ing its thickness and ulcerated internal surface. It begins about 6 cm. inside the anus, and extends from 4 to 6 cm. upwards. It is a carcinoma of the scirrhus type. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 84.) 36.113. Carcinoma of the Rectum with Stricture. Hunterian. R. 55a. About 7 cm. above the anus there is a hard ring stricture, slit open down one side, produced by a growth about 6 cm. in diameter, and extending up the bowel for about 6 cm. The mucous membrane is hypertrophied, and the rest of the bowel-wall generally thickened. In the middle is a sort of hour-glass con- striction of the tumour, and at this point the stricture is tightest. "Lord T., above a year's standing, dreadful case." It is a carci- noma of the scirrhus type. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 86. Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. IV., PI. IV., fig. 1.)

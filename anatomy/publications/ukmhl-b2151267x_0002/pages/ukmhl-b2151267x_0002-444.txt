8-2G HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 50.95. Anterior Hemicrania. Human. Hunteriun. 21 M. 3. (Thlipsencephale.) The head and shoulders of a foetus. The head is of the same shape as in the anencephalic monsters, but the anterior part of the top of it is covered with bone and hairy scalp, forming a sort of half cranium, whence the name. " There is a kind of wart, or cicatrix-like appearance, in the integuments behind," extending from side to side, and from the neck up to the vertex. This membrane is continuous with the skin round the edges. In the centre of it is a small excrescence similar to that seen in the preceding. 50.96. Anterior Hemicrania. Human. Hunterian. MM. (Pseudencephale.) Head and shoulders of a foetus similar to the preceding. The cervical portion of the vertebral canal is also open, laid out flat, and covered by a thin membranous sac, which allows the bones to be seen clearly. The base of the skull and the vertebral column meet at an acute angle, as is seen in the anen- cephalia and amyelia (No. 78). The vault is laid flat, close down on the top of the basi-occipital. There is a small fungous excrescence as in the preceding, which is raised to show the shallow slit repre- senting the cranial cavity. 50.97. Hemicrania. Posterior Encephalocele. Amyelia. Human. From Dr. Allen Thomson's CoUedion. (Pseudencephale.) A foetus about the seventh month, with small flat cranium, which is deficient in the occipital region. From the hole hangs a loose round sac 6'5 cm. in diameter, streaked with black pigment externally. Its walls are fairly thick, and part of their substance resembles brain tissue. The sac hangs down over the neck to about the middle of the dorsal region; it is torn below. The vertebral canal is open and laid flat from the occiput to the lumbar regionâ€”amyelia. 50.98. Posterior Exencephalia with Amyelia. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection.. (Pseudencephale.) Similar to the preceding.

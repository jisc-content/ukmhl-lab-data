BEZOARS. 8S3 52.94. Oriental Bezoar. i Part of a similar concretion, the nucleus a piece of grass. Huntericm. 52.95. Portions of Oriental Bezoars. Hunter ian. A small box containing fragments of these concretions and several seeds which formed their nuclei. Half of an irregularly shaped concretion, cut, showing the nucleusâ€” a relatively large mass of earthy matter. Portion of a much larger bezoar sawn longitudinally. It is of oblong shape, with cleanly rounded ends, measures 4 by 2 cm., is dark greenish-brown in colour and polished externallj% of similar colour internally. Part of the nucleus is preserved ; it appears to have been a very thin piece of grass or wood fibre. 52.98. Oriental Bezoar. Hunterian. A smaller concretion, 3'2 by 1'3 cm., sawn longitudinally. It is of olive green colour. 52.99. Oriental Bezoar. Hunterian. Half of a concretion, large for this class, measuring 4 by 2'6 cm., of light olive green colour and beautifully polished externally. The cut surface, which has been varnished to preserve it, shows a very fine concentric lamination. The nucleus, which has for the most part been removed, appears to have consisted of a considerable mass of vegetable fibre, measuring 2-2 by 1 cm. The calculus is even harder and heavier than the preceding calculi, yet on testing by the flame it consists almost entirely of combustible organic matter, and leaves only very minute mineral ash, consisting of earthy phos- phates and carbonates. 52.96.

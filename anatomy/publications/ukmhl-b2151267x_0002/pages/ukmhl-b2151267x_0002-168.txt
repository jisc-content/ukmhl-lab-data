550 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 42.15. The Base of the Bladder in the Male, with the Prostate and Cowper's Glands and the Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa Deferentia. Hunierian. A A. 16. Similar to the preceding, but with the roots of the corpora caver- nosa and bulb of the urethra. Cowper's glands are seen as two small rounded bodies at the back of the bulb. Their ducts (marked with bristles) are seen opening in the floor of the urethra about 3 cm. further forward. 42.16. The Base of the Bladder, and the Prostate and Cowper's Glands. Hunterian. AA. 20. A similar preparation to No. 42.14, " to show principally Cowper's glands lying on the under side of the membranous portion of the urethra, between the bulb and the prostate gland." 42.17. Cowper's Glands. Hunterian. The prostate gland and part of the urethra opened from the front, showing the above, finely dissected, lying just behind the bulb, and their ducts opening in the penile part of the urethra, some distance further forward. (Specimen marked CC. 13 on jar.) 42.18. The Male Urethra. Hunterian. AA. 14, A portion of the urethra, injected red (the brightness rather faded), and slit open, showing its vascular lining wrinkled longi- tudinally, and dotted with the orifices of mucous glands. 42.19. The Vesiculae Seminales, Vasa Deferentia, Ejacula- tory Ducts, and Ducts of the Prostate Gland, injected with Mercury. Hunterian. A A. 17. The prostate is injected by eight or ten ducts, which open around the caput gallinaginis, beside the ejaculatory ducts. The cavities of the gland and of the vesiculae are exaggerated by the injection. The junction of the vesicula seminalis and vas deferens into ejaculatory duct is very well shown. Dried and mounted in turpentine. Most of the mercury has escaped from the cavities of the vesiculae.

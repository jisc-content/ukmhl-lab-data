674 HVNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48.31. The Blood-vessels of the Vagina during Pregnancy. Hunterian. BR. 157. "A portion of the uterus and vagina, vessels injected green. The vessels of the vagina are enlarged as well as those of the uterus." 48.32. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. Independ- ence of the Foetal and Maternal Circulations. Hunterian. EE. 21. " One side of the gravid uterus at the sixth month, with placenta adhering; the red injection returned by the veins of the mother from the hypogastric artery; not a drop got into the cord though the uterus was exceedingly red; the cord was afterwards injected white and black." This specimen demonstrates perfectly the independence of the foetal and maternal circulations. " Much has been said or supposed about a communication between these vessels and those of the uterus, but from all the experiments I have made upon the human subject (and upon quadrupeds like- wise), it plainly appears that the umbilical arteries terminate in the umbilical veins, and not in the vessels of the uterus ; and that the blood passes from the arteries into the veins, as in other parts, and so back to the child again." (Description of the Gravid Uterus, p. 33.) 48.33. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. The Foetal Membranes. Hunterian. EE. 22. The other part of the preceding. It shows the vascularity of the uterine wall, including both layers of the decidua, which are separated down near the cervix. At this point also the foetal membranes, which line the inner surface of the specimen, are separated to show the two layersâ€”amnion innermost and chorion between it and the decidua reflexa. The cervix uteri is not shortened. The os externum is slightly patulous. Compare Nos. 48.44-48.50. The membranes, amnion and chorion, are cut to allow a bristle to be passed through the Fallopian tube. A slice has been cut off the ovary to show in section a corpus luteum beautifully injected. Compare Nos. 48.51 et seq.

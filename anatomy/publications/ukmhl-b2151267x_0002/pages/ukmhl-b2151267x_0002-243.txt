625 MYOMA OF THE UTERUS. large walnut appears in the fundus; is almost perfectly spherical and internally spongy." "The substance of the fundus uteri rendered thin by distension in consequence of the growth of the tumour, but sound in its structure." On slicing a portion of the cut surface the tissue presents the characteristic whorled appearance of a myoma, but is traversed by an unusual number of blood vessels, whence its spongy appearance. (Figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings.) The cervix uteri is normal. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 140.) 45.39. Myoma of the Uterus. Submucous grown out into Vagina. Hunterian. CC. 76. Half of uterus and vagina, with a large m3foma, divided by sagittal section to show the relation of the parts. The tumour springs by a broad base from the posterior wall of the fundus uteri; the cervix envelopes its neck; and the distended vagina encloses its body, which has been about the size of a child's head at birth. The appearance of the cut surface is typical of the myoma or fibro-myoma. 4-5.40. Myoma of the Uterus. Submucous grown out into Vagina. Hunterian. CC. 77. The other half of the preceding. It shows the breadth of the neck much better. In the old catalogue it is remarked that " no operation could here succeed." The only operation at that time was strangulation by ligature, which would not have been possible ; but it certainly appears that it might have been shelled out, or the uterus extirpated. 45.41. Submucous Myoma distending the whole Uterus. Hunterian. CC. 78. " Uterus dilated by a pyramidal polypus to the size of a gravid uterus at five months-; vagina and uterus opened; the polypus adheres by its base to the fundus uteri, but it is not connected with the uterus anywhere else, and its apex is just pushing through OS tincae." The uterus is distended as if by pregnancy, the cervix is shortened, and the os dilated to the size of a shilling, presenting an appearance not unlike that which would be met in an early stage

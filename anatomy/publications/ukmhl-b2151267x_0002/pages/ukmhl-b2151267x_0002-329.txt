711 THE PLACENTA. and the chorion torn from the inside. The foetal vessels filled with the vermilion injection are seen branching most beauti- fully on the outer (placental) surface of the chorion and in the mass of the placenta. Also shows the intervillous spaces (maternal blood-cells) as "innumerable small vacuities, with free communi- cations through the whole substance," as described under specimen No. 48.123. Compare also Nos. 48.135 and 48.134ffi. 48.141. Maternal Blood-spaces (Intervillous Spaces or " Cells ") of the Placenta. Himterian. Eli. 179. " A very small portion of the placenta and membranes ; the cells injected red, and some vessels from the uterus seen behind, passing towards the placenta." It seems to be a mass of red injection which has a granular appearance from being broken up by innumer- able processes of foetal tissue. " The wax was everywhere manifestly granulated ; so that it had plainly filled natural cavities ; for if it had filled the substance of the placenta by common extravasation it would have formed itself into irregular and large masses." (Description of PI. X., fig. 2, in Hunter's Gravid Uterus.) 48.142. Uterine Veins Entering the Placenta. Huntericm. ER. 178. " A section of uterus, with the veins injected green, and broken off where they were entering into the placenta." 48.143. Uterine Veins Entering the Placenta. Huntericm. EE. 144. " A portion of the placenta injected black (from the umbilical cord); some veins may be seen injected green (from the uterus) which are entering into the substance of the placenta." 48.144. Uterine Veins Entering the Placenta. Himterian. EE. â€”. (Not numbered or described.) A portion of the uterus and placenta injected green from the uterine vessels. The placenta is partly separated from the uterine wall, and in the angle are seen the " corresponding orifices (of the torn veins) on the parted sur- faces." See under No. 48.85.

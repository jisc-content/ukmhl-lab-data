432 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. A thick cuticle is turned down (the torn mouths of the glands hang from its deep surface), leaving bare the mucous membrane with the mouths of numerous glandular follicles. From the deep surface of this the muscular layer has been raised, show- ing the bases of the same glands set close together, ranging in size from a grain of wheat to a grain of maize, and distinctly lobulated. 33. 38. The Glands of the Stomach of the Ostrich. H'inttcrian. 0. 335. Similar to the preceding. 33.39. The Stomach of a Chicken. Proventriculus and Gizzard. Himtenan. 0. 10. Laid open, showing the glandular part lined with thick mucous membrane studded with glandular follicles, and the gizzard, which corresponds to the pyloric region of the mammalian stomach, with thick muscular wall lined with a strong cuticle. At the back of the specimen hangs a piece of the intestine inverted, showing the villi very long. Injected red, but the colour has degenerated to black. 33.40. Gizzard of Goose. Hunterian. 0. 13. A transverse section of the above, showing an immensely thick (about 5 cm.) muscular wall, with a thick, almost horny, cuticular lining adapted for grinding the hard food on which the bird lives. The section also shows the pair of tendons which unite the two great masses of muscle, affording them a purchase for acting on one another like millstones. 33. 41. Gizzard of a Small Bird. Hunterian. 0. 15. Said to be from a sparrow, but looks much too large. Like the preceding on a small scale. The cavity of the organ is expanded; when opened this always contains a quantity of small stones and other hard objects which appear to serve as grinders. 33. 42. Gizzard of Ostrich. Hunterian. 0. 42c. Section of the above, showing the strong muscular walls and a very thick cuticular lining.

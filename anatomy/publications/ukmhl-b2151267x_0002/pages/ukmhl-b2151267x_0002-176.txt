558 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 4-2.54. Vas Aberrans of the Epididymis. Hunterian. Y. 47. Similar to the preceding. The vas aberrans is double and very- long. In turpentine on blue paper. 42.55. Vas Aberrans of the Epididymis. Hunterian. Y. ila. Similar to the preceding. On blue paper in turpentine. 42.56. Vas Aberrans of the Epididymis, Hunterian.

A testicle with the vas deferens injected with mercury. The vasa efferentia and coni vasculosi are well displayed, and beside them arises an aberrant tube ending in a little sac, also filled with mercury. The latter, which goes by the above name, is one of the tubes of the Wolffian body not utilized in the formation of the ducts of the testicle. Mounted in turpentine. (c) The Descent of the Testicles. The following eight specimens and three in the comparative anatomy division of the series, with possibly one or two which are not here, form the set of dissections with reference to which John Hunter wrote his paper " On the State of the Testis in the Foetus and on the Hernia Congenita." The paper, along with three plates, was published first in William Hunter's "Medical Commentaries" (pp. 71-89), and afterwards republished by John Hunter, " with some practical observations added," in the volume of essays on the "Animal Oeconomy," which forms Vol. IV. of Palmer's edition of his works. The specimens from which Plate I. was taken were readily identified; but as to that (or those) from which Plates II. and III. were drawn there is some doubt, there being none which corresponds exactly. For Congenital Hernia see Nos. 36.18 to 36.22.

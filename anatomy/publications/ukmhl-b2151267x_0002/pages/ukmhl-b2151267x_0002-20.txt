HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 402 periosteum." This periosteum clothes all that part of the surface of the tooth which is covered by the crusta petrosa {i.e. all that is not covered by enamel), and is highly' vascular. The vessels are exceedingly minute. In turpentine. 29.34. The Dental Periosteum. Hunterian. PP. 34. Similar to the preceding; in turpentine. 29.35. The Dental Periosteum and Pulp. HurderioM. PP. 35. " Two incisors of the second set," injected red, similar to the preceding. One of them is split obliquely, showing the pulp cavity. A lens is required to distinguish the vessels in these specimens. In turpentine. The Development of the Teeth. 29.36. The Development of the Alveolar Processes. Lower Jaw. Hunterian. PP. ila. Four lower jaws of foetuses at various ages, macerated, dried, and mounted on blue paper, showing the above. The jaw is hollowed out into a deep gutter, in which arise septa of bone, dividing it into cells, those of the incisors being formed first. The cells are very large compared with the teeth they are to contain, in order to allow room for the formative structures. Correspond probably to figs. 1, 4, and 6 of PI. VI., loc. cit. 29.37. The Lower Jaw of a Foetus at Seven Months. Hunterian. PP. 51. Showing the formation of the teeth in capsules embedded in the jaw bone. The beginnings of the whole ten first teeth are seen, only the crowns yet formed. The dentine caps of the central incisors have been removed, and that of the right first molar is raised up by a bristle, showing the highly vascular pulps. Of the dentine cap of the second left molar only the outer rim and the cusps are formed, and its centre is occupied by a mass of highly vascular soft tissue. The enamel cannot be

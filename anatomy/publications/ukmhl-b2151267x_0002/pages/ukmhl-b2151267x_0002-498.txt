880 EUNTEIUA N A NA TOMIC.IL CA TALOG UE. 52.86. Concretion of Vegetable Fibres and Triple Phos- phates. Hniiferiuit. Half of a very large calculus, 15 cm. (6 inches) in diameter, 47 cm. (lb| inches) in circumference. "From a Horse" The whole calculus has apparently been of spherical .shape. It is of light brown colour; its exterior nodulated ; it has the velvet}' feeling of the oat seed concretions; in the cut surface it shows numerous layers of soft chalk}^ mineral matter. It consists of the setae of the oat seed principally, with other vegetable matters. The mineral constituents are principall}- triple phosphates of magnesium and ammonium, but it is readily fusible, showing that there is a considerable admixture of phosphate of calcium. The centre seems to be pure felted vege- table fibre without an}' solid organic or inorganic nucleus. 52.87. Concretion of Vegetable Fibres and Mixed Phos- phates. Hmiterian. A similar calculus, uncut. Not quite so large as the preceding. Darker brown in colour. Contains a large projjortioii of inorganic matter which, as in the preceding, is iirincipally triple phosphate. 52.88. Concretion of Vegetable Fibres and Mixed Phos- phates. Hunterian. A similar calculus, but considerably smaller; nearly T)lack in colour externally ; in section seen to consist principally of inorganic matter, for the most part triple phosphates. 52. 89. Concretion of Vegetable Fibres and Mixed Phos- phates. Hunterian. Half of a small calculus consisting of soft mixed phosphates, mostly triple, but fairly easily fusible, with a small proportion of of vegetable fibre. Looks like a ball of dried mud. It is nodulated externally like the preceding calculi. DIVISION III. Bezoav Stones. In the collection were found nineteen calculi, or boxes of portions of calculi, which in their general appearance, characters, and

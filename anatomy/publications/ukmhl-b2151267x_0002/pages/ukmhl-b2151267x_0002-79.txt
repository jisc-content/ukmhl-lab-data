THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 461 35.81. The Mucous Membrane of the Rectum. Hunterian. Pi. 21. Similar to the preceding. 35.82. The Mucous Membrane of the Rectum. The Lymphatic Follicles. Hunterian. R. 2-2a. Rectum of an adult slit open, "hardened in alum and water," uninjected. Shows vast numbers of solitary lymphatic follicles. Comparative Anatomy of the Intestines. 35.83. The Small Intestine of the Dog. The Villi. Hunterian. P. 53a. A small portion of the above, highly injected red, and inverted to show the villi, " which are long and wavy, small at the extremities like hairs—become a little thicker as they approach the villous coat, and then seem smaller again—so under the microscope." 35.84. The Small Intestine of the Dog. The Villi. Hunterian. P. 53&. Like the preceding it was injected red, but the pigment used has degenerated, and it is now black. There are no valvulae conniventes ; the villi are very long. "In this, as in the last, the arteries had for hours previously been injected with warm water, and this was begun while the animal was warm." Probably this was done to clear the blood out of the vessels and facilitate the entrance of the injection fluid. 35.85. The Small Intestine of the Goat. The Villi. Hunterian. P. 53c. A portion of the above, injected red and inverted, showing the villi very distinctly. "The villi resemble more the human, and have considerable breadth, leaving a loose edge towards the cavity of the intestine, rather than a loose waving point as in the dog."

882 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. produced, which condenses in the form of long spear-shaped crystals of a yellow colour with a shade of green. These crystals do not differ in their chemical habitudes from the powder of the calculus, and they are identical in shape and appearance with those procured from the ellagic acid of the gall-nut when similarly treated." They " easily dissolve, with the exception of a few flocks, in a cold solution of caustic potash or soda. The solution is of a deep brownish-red colour with a shade of green," the green appearing most when it is viewed in a thin layer. Hydrochloric acid throws down from the potash solution a "greenish buff-coloured powder, while the suj)erna- tant fluid is of a light red colour." For other tests, vide Joe. cit. They are found in the stomachs of wild goats of Persia and other parts of Central Asia, and also in the stomachs of apes. They originate from the juices of the plants on which the animals feed, by agglutination round about some indigestible foreign body. All manner of medicinal virtues were formerly attributed to them. 52.90. Ellagic Acid Concretion. Oriental Bezoar. Hu7iterian. An oriental bezoar of the size and shape of an olive, uncut. It is of dark greenish-brown colour and beautifully polished. It is very heavy for its size (of high specific gravity), and sinks like a stone in water. 52.91. Oriental Bezoar. Hunterian. Portions of a similar concretion, broken to show the internal structure. The nucleus is absent. 52.92. Oriental Bezoar. Hunterian. Portions of a similar concretion showing the nucleus—a flat thin shelled nut rather larger than a cherry stone. 52.93. Oriental Bezoar. Hunterian. Of oblong shape, 3 by 1 cm., broken, showing the nucleus—a fragment of wood measuring about 2 by 5 cm.—the elongated shape of the calculus corresponding to that of its nucleus.

907 URIC ACID CALCULI. Hunterian. 53.47. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A similar calculus about the size of a pigeon's egg. The nucleus is uric acid, pure, with a distinct narrow ring of dark coloured almost pure calcium oxalate round it; the rest mixed. A stone rather larger than the preceding, consisting of pale, rather soft, uric acid round a small nucleus of uric acid mixed with a large proportion of calcium oxalate. 53.49. Uric Acid and Calcium Oxalate Calculus. An oval very hard stone about the size of a plover's egg, cut across its long diameter. In its centre is a cavity in which the nucleus—a small dark brown calcium oxalate calculus— lies loose. The cavity is lined by a thin shell of dark calcium oxalate, outside which the greater part of the calculus consists of granulated calcium oxalate mixed with uric acid; the proportion of uric acid gradually increases towards the exterior, and the structure changes to the dense laminated formation ; the outermost part is nearly pure uric acid. Exterior nearly smooth. 53.50. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A large blunt oval stone of pale uric acid—partly granulated, partly dense and laminated—round a small calcium oxalate stone, which has a very small nucleus of urate of ammonium. The outer layers show a trace of urate of ammonium. 53.51. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A stone about the size of a pigeon's egg, composed of uric acid with traces of calcium oxalate—in very fine laminae of beautifully varied shades of brown—round a small calcium oxalate calculus with urate of ammonium centre. A considerable part of one end of the stone has broken away—evidently while it was in the bladder, as there are traces of phosphates deposited on the broken surfaces. II. 2 K 53.48.

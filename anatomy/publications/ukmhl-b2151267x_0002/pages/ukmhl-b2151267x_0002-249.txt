(b) Malignant Tumours of the Uterus, Vagina, and Vulva. 45. a66. Warty Epithelioma of the Vulva. Dr. Laurie, Greenock. 1898. The specimen consists of a labium minus considerably enlarged by the presence in it of a well-defined tumour of flattened oval shape about the size of a filbert (3x2x1 cm.). The growth is sessile, implanted in and distending the labium; on the two sides and free edge it presents a warty appearance. In section it shows a stem and branching papillae of connective tissue sheathed with a thick layer of stratified epithelium, which is distinguishable from the connective tissue by its denser and more homogeneous appearance. Under the microscope this epithelial covering of the papillae is seen to be very thick, and in places appears to be growing down into the connective tissue and infiltrating it rather than to be borne up on the papillae ; in certain parts there are laminated capsules (epithelial pearl bodies). From the last two characters it is to be regarded as a warty epithelioma rather than a simple wart (papilloma). (Presented by the West of Scotland Clinical Kesearch Laboratory. Report No. 2/165.)

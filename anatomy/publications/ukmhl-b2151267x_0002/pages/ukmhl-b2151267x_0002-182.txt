The right testicle is just below the kidney as in No. 42.59. The left, its tunica vaginalis dissected away, lies just outside the external abdominal ring beside and rather above the penis. A bristle is passed through the neck of the processus vaginalis. 42. 64. The Processus Vaginales of "a Foetus at 8 Months." Hunterian. Y. 59. The bladder, the umbilical arteries (the urachus lying between them), and the processus vaginales " taken out of the body of a foetus at 8 months, but in situ nearly." The bladder is cut open from before and bristles placed in the ureters, and on both sides the tunica vaginalis is opened at the bottom to show the testicles down. The upper part of the processus, still unclosed, is held open by bristles. 42.65. The Testicles in the Scrotum. Processus Vagi- nales Obliterated. Hunterian. Y. 60. A similar preparation to No. 42.62, showing the testicles in the scrotum carefully dissected, and the tunica vaginalis opened on both sides. From behind is seen, at either side of the bladder, a little pit in the peritoneal lining of the abdominal wall, which shows where the testicles and the processus passed ; there is now no passage there, obliteration being complete. The age of the subject is not recorded ; apparently a full-grown foetus. 42. 66. The Testicles Descended abnormally Early. Hunterian. Y. QOa. A similar preparation from a very young foetus, showing the testicles already down. The age of the foetus is not recorded. It shows that the time of the descent is very variable. The peri- toneal processes are still open. Only the right side is dissected. (d) Anatomy of the Penis. 42.67. A Penis in the Erect Condition. Hunterian. BB. 1.

813 SINGLE 2I0NSTERS. 50.56. Peromelus. Human. Himterian. RR. 299, An embryo apparently, from its size, in the third month ; the limbs are fairly well formed, but skin bound, i.e. bound down to the sides and front and enclosed in skin which is practically continuous with that of the body ; the outlines of the limbs are quite distinct. The head is in a similar condition, the grooves of the neck being non-existent. 50. 57. Peromelus. Dog. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. (Hemimele.) A puppy, apparently new born, in which all four limbs are unduly short and the paws deformed, having only one or two rudimentary claws apiece. The folds of the elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles are quite distinct, as in the preceding human monstrosity. Male. 50.58. Perobrachius. Human. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. (Hemimele.) A male foetus, both arms of which are deformed in the same manner. The humeral portion is about the natural size; the forearm is extremely short, and the radial side of it much shorter than the ulnar, in consequence of which the hand is doubled up on the arm to a condition of rather more than semi-flexion. The hand has only four digits, the thumb being com- pletely wanting. The legs are badly formed, and there is double talipesâ€”varus of the right, valgus of the left. The greater part of the abdominal viscera are protruded through a small defect in the abdominal wall into the root of the umbilical cord. 50.59. Peromelus Monobrachius. Dog. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. (Ectromele.) A female puppy, apparently new born, the right fore limb of which is represented by a little hair-covered nipple- like process. There is also a double cleft palate. Otherwise the animal is well formed. 50.60. Peromelus Perobrachius. Cat. Hunterian. MM. 32. (Ectromele.) A young female kitten which has no left fore leg, and the right reduced to a forearm with rudimentary paw, which has only two digits, and these flexed to an acute angle upon it.

CALCULI OF URIC ACID AND PHOSPHATES. 911 *53.64. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of an oval stone about the size of a pigeon's egg. It has a small rounded nucleus of pale pinkish-white colour, very hard, consisting of uric acid and urate of ammonium. This is surrounded by a thin shell of dark brown calcium oxalate, outside of which the stone consists of pale soft uric acid with traces of oxalate and in the outermost layers a large amount of fusible mixed phosphates. {Hunterian Plate XVII., fig. 4.) 53.65. Uric Acid, Phosphate, and Calcium Carbonate Calculus. Hunterian. A stone very similar in appearance to the preceding set of speci- mens, consisting of a uric acid calculus about the size of a pigeon's â‚¬gg enclosed in a thin white shell like the mixed phosphates but denser and of more chalky appearance; also smoother externally. This layer fuses without much difficulty before the blowpipe as if composed of mixed phosphates, but with cold hydrochloric acid it effervesces freely; apparently consists of phosphates mixed with some calcium carbonate. (cZ) Calculi consisting princi]oally of Uric Acid, and containing some Urate of Ammonium. The presence of urate of ammonium was determined by the evolu- tion of ammonia on addition of caustic potash. No attempt was made to estimate the relative proportions of uric acid and urates in these calculi. Compare Urate of Ammonium Calculi. 53.66. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. A small circular disc-shaped stone consisting of uric acid and a trace of calcium oxalate in fine dense laminae, with a small centre which contains much urate of ammonium. 53.67. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. A small oval stone of pale uric acid, mostly of the granular form, with a small compact nucleus which contains urate of ammonium.

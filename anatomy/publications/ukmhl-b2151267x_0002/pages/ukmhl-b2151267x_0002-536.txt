HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 918 much urate of ammonium. Several specimens are coated with mixed phosphates, which in one forms the principle bulk of the calculus. Calcium oxalate calculi are extremely hard. Before the blowpipe they swell up to a loose white or grey ash of calcium carbonate, which effervesces with hydrochloric acid, and has a strong alkaline reaction. Calcium oxalate dissolves in hydrochloric acid without effervescence, and is insoluble in cold acetic acid. (ft) Calcium Oxalate, pure or nearly so. 53.91. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a stone of irregular spherical shape, about the size of a pigeon's egg, showing the characteristic rough pronged exterior of the mulberry calculus. It has a small nucleus of uric acid. Some of its layers are of loose texture from the presence of much organic matter, others very dense and hard; pure calcium oxalate, except the nucleus. 53.92. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian. A section of a mulberry calculus which has been considerably larger than a hen's egg, and of very irregular spherical shape, the prongs being very long. It is built up of fine laminae, of various shades of brown in colour, of pure calcium oxalate round a small nucleus of urate of ammonium. In the hollows of its exterior there is a deposit of mixed phosphates. 53.93. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a calculus consisting of pure calcium oxalate throughout, with the exception of a very little phosphate on its exterior. It is finely nodulated, and is built up of granules and laminae rather loosely put together. Broken at one end. 53.94. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian. A small oval calculus, uncut, showing the very rough nodulated surface.

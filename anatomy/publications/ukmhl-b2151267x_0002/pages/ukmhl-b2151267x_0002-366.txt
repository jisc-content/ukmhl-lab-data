748 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. numerous arteries and veins; within this sac is a loose highly vascular tissue thrown into innumerable fine processes, in the interstices of which lay the chorionic villi. Below hangs the velvety, or rather woolly-looking, ball of chorionic villi, Avhich is the foetal portion of the placenta. The intermingling of the two portions is more complex and intimate here than in any of the preceding specimens, and their separation (at least their artificial separation) is attended by a certain amount of visible laceration of maternal tissues. Compare next specimen. 48.246. Foetal Portion of Placentula of Sheep. Himtcrian. EB. 313. A portion of foetal membranes of a sheep, with two of the cotyledons drawn out of their maternal envelopes. Injected white from the foetus. They are globular tufts of highly developed chorionic villi, set on narrow bases (about half the breadth of the tuft) through which enter the umbilical vessels. Between the foetal villi here and there are fragments of the maternal processes, injected red and blue. Here there is clearly a shedding of maternal tissue— a decidua—but not a regular decidual membrane as in the carnivora and primates. 48.247. Sections of Placentula of Sheep. Hunterian. RB. 325. " A portion of uterus, with a perpendicular section through three of the above, showing structure and connection." Injected red and blue from the mother. 48.248. Sections of Placentula of Sheep. Hunterian. RB. 326. A similar preparation, with four cotyledons cut in various directions, and one whole one with the uterine wall stripped from its base, to show its fibrous capsule and the maternal vessels entering it; injected red and blue. In the sections the uninjected villi are seen cut in various directions, mostly oblique and trans- verse. Their tissues present in section a clear glancing appearance. In the transverse sections the bunch of these glancing villi is seen permeated by yellowish processes of maternal (decidual)

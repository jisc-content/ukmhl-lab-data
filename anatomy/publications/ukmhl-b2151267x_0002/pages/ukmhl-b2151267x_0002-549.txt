931 PHOSPHATIC CALCULI. *53.149. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus of rounded tetrahedral shape, about the size of a pigeon's egg, consisting of a relatively large oval mass of hard ammonium urate and phosphates enclosed in an irregular layer of the loose soft phosphates which gives the shape to the stone. {Hunterian Plate XVIIL, figs. 4 and 5.) 53.150. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A small flattened oval calculus of similar composition. 53.151. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A small oval calculus of similar composition, but showing a minute nucleus which consists of ammonium urate without any phosphates. 53.152. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Small flattened oval stone similar in composition to No. 53.149. 53.153. Several Mixed Phosphate Calculiâ€”from the The specimen consists of a stone about the size of a marble, of rounded shape with several small facets, and a number of small calculi which seem to have fitted into the facets. The large stone consists of a centre of urate of ammonium and phosphates, then layers of very soft phosphates with traces of calcium carbonate, and a shell of several layers of harder chalky yellowish phosphates, which fuse less readily, and contain much urate of ammonium. The little stones are of similar composition. 53.154. Mixed Phosphate Calculus. An oval stone measuring 3'2 by 1-8 cm. composed of mixed phosphates with distinct traces of urate of ammonium round a nucleus of urate of ammonium. "From a patient of Dr. P. Stewart. Found in perinaeum when laying open urethra to reach bladder in a case of retention and afterwards extravasation of urine." Bladder. Hunterian.

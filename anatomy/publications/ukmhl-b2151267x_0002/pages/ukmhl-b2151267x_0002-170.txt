HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 552 (b) The Testicle. 42.26. Tlie Testicle, Spermatic Cord, and Tunica Vagi- nalis. Huntericm. Y. 1. "The tunica vaginalis was distended with spirit till hard, then a portion cut out on one side to show the enclosed testicle ; a piece of wax pushed upwards shows how far the coat extends upwards, which is about one inch and a half above the testicle." This is however, a variable condition. Compare descent of the testicle specimens. The wax had decayed, and has been replaced by a bristle. 4-2.27. The Testicle, Epididymis, and Tunica Vaginalis. Hunterian. Y. 11. A specimen similar to the preceding, but showing more clearly the relations of the tunica vaginalis to the epididymis. 42.28. The Relations of the Testicles to one another. Hunterian. Y. 12. " Both testicles, the tunica vaginalis removed and the cord a little dissected. The testicles are hung nearly in situ naturali, that is obliquely up and down, the larger end forwards and upwards, the smaller in the opposite directions, the one side outwards and the other inwards." The anterior ends are a little inclined away from one another. It shows the above and also the general form of the epididymis and vas deferens. In front of the globus major of the epididymis are seen two or three little vesicles, which are remains of some of the end tubes of the Wolffian body. 42.29. The Testicle, Epididymis, and Spermatic Cord. Hunterian, Y. 2. The tunica vaginalis has been entirely removed, revealing the proper capsule or tunica albuginea of the testicle, and the organ is hung in its natural position by the spermatic cord, which is a little dissected. It shows the epididymis lying on the top of the testicle, its larger end—globus major—anterior and superior. The vas deferens rises from the lower and posterior end—globus minor

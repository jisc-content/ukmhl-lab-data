The base of the skull is covered by an irregularly lobed mass of thin-walled cysts, some of which have burst and lie collapsed. The bridge of the nose is replaced by a cyst of the same description, measuring 3 era. in diameter. (Proencephale.) Below this is a flat bar of flesh representing the point and alae of the nose. There is com- plete double harelip and cleft palate. 50.90. Hemicrania. Human. Hunterian. MM. 62. (Nosencephale.) Head of a large foetus, injected red.

GALL STONES. 867 in number, and their edges are sharply cut and polished. Several of them are split, showing the centre of dark brown bilirubin calcium mixed with cholesterine crystals, forming about half of the calculus, surrounded by a narrow layer of white crystalline cholesterine, out- side which is a thin lamina of loose white opaque cholesterine and the outer shell of very dense translucent white cholesterine, which appears, under a considerable magnifying power, to be quite amorphous. In a stone of 7'5 mm. this shell is less than -5 mm. in thickness. Now, after drying for over a century, they just float in water. The similar stones in No. 38.16 were said to sink even when dry. 52.34. Pearly Faceted Gall Stones in Process of Forma- tion. Hunterian. A number of small calculi of various irregular shapes, more or less rounded, but with distinct facets, mottled brown and pearly grey in colour. In section they are seen to consist of a large centre of bilirubin calcium mixed, especially in its outer parts, with crystals of cholesterine, enclosed in a thin shell of dense white cholesterine, through which the brown centre is visible more or less clearly according to its thickness, giving the mottled appearance. Float in water. Clearly belong to the same class as the preceding. (C) COMMON GALL STONES. Calculi of very various sizes and shapes, mostly faceted, con- sisting of a central stone of one or other of the preceding classes (mostly the crystalline cholesterine stones), covered with a layer of bilirubin calcium of varying thickness. 52.35. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. A very large calculus cut in two, of irregular cubical shape, more or less faceted on the sides and with a deeply concave facet on either end. Measures fully 3 cm. on all sides. It consists of a large, nearly pure, globular crystalline cholesterine gall stone, 2-5 cm. in diameter, enclosed in a shell of nearly pure bilirubin calcium from 2 to 5 mm. thick. Sinks easily in water.

Four small stones passed by a patient of Dr. Mackenzie. Three of them are of oval shape, less than 1 cm. long, of dark brown colour and smooth. The fourth, slightly larger, is partly covered by dark organic matter (blood), which causes to adhere to it a number of minute calculi giving it a tuberculated appearance. Thej^ are all composed of pure uric acid. 53.23. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A small oval concretion about the size of a cherry stone, roughly tuberculated externally. Uric acid with a good deal of organic matter entangled with the tubercles. 53.24. Uric Acid Calculus. A calculus similar to but considerably smaller than the preceding ; it was taken from a box of calculi of which the history is unknown. Not Hunterian. Attached was the history, " From urethra of a boy by incision." 53.25. Uric Acid Calculus. Similar to the preceding, from the same collection. " By incision "â€”presumably from the urethra. 53.26. Uric Acid Calculus. Renal (?). Hunterian. A calculus, uncut, of considerable size and irregular elongated form, measuring 8 cm. in length by from 1-5 to 2 cm. in thickness. It is fairly smooth, but has several rounded projections. It is of deep reddish-brown colour, very hard and its exterior is pure uric acid. To judge by its shape it is a kidney stone.

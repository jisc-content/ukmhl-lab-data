498 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. for fully 9 cm. on its anterior, 6 cm. on its posterior aspect. It is laid open from behind; the cut surface is of consider- able thickness, the tumour having extended widely beyond the bowel wall. It is a highly cellular carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 92.) 36.117. Carcinoma of the Rectum. Infiltration of Recto- Vaginal Septum. Hunterian. CO. 596. " An uterus about the size of the impregnated at two months, diseased apparently; rectum is laid open behind, and is evidently cancerous." The wall of the rectum all round is thickened, and ulcerated internally in patches for a length of about 4 cm. There was probably a degree of stricture. The uterus itself appears to be quite free from the tumour, but the recto-vaginal septum is exten- sively infiltrated. Microscopically it is a highly cellular carcinoma, not cylinder celled. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 120.) 36.118. Carcinomatous Infiltration of the Mesentery and Mesenteric Glands, secondary to a Tumour of the Stomach. Hunterian. P. 99. A loop of bowel with mesentery, injected red. The mesentery is greatly thickened. It is chiefly the glands that are affected, but the other tissues appear also more or less infiltrated. The bowel appears thickenedâ€”probably just oedematous. Microscopic examination shows masses of epithelial cells infiltrating the mesentery in every direction, but somewhat obscured by the amount of inflammatory round-cell infiltration around them, as in the primary tumour (0.55, now 34. 24). (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 73.) 36.119, Carcinomatous Infiltration of the Mesentery and Mesenteric Glands, secondary to a Tumour of the Stomach. Hunterian. P. 100. A loop of bowel with mesentery from the same case as the preceding and similar to it.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE STOMACH. 4:31 33.34. The Stomach of a Ruminant Animal. Goat. Hunterian. 0. 38. â– 'The four stomachs of a goat inverted to show their internal surfaces : that of the first is villous ; that of the second like the cells of a honeycomb ; that of the third like the septa in an orange, only villous; that of the fourth is not much distant from the internal surface of the human stomach." The last is the one which secretes the true acid gastric juice. The quill marks the oesophageal orifice. Compare next specimen. 33.34a. The Stomach of a Ruminant Animal. Hunterian. (Not numbered or described.) A stomach similar to the pre- ceding, not inverted, and with part of the oesophagus remaining. The first stomach (or division of the stomach), the "rumen" or " paunch," is laid open and partly cut away. The second, the "reticulum" or "honeycomb bag," is the large unopened sac con- stituting the greater part of the specimen. The third, the " omasum," " psalterium," or " manyplies," is laid open from end to end, showing the septa more naturally than in the preceding speci- men. Of the fourth, the " abomasum," only a portion remains. 33.35. The Glands of the Stomach of the Pigeon. Hunterian. G. 20. A portion of the first or digestive stomach of the pigeon, showing a thick mucous membrane composed almost entirely of oval compound glands with round orifices set on end, in appearance somewhat like the larvae of bees in a honeycomb. 33.36. The Glands of the Stomach of the Ostrich. Hunterian. G. 17. A portion of the proventriculus or digestive stomach of the above, similar to the preceding on a large scale. See next specimen. 33.37. The Glands of the Stomach of the Ostrich. Hunterian. 0. 33rt.. A portion of the proventriculus or digestive stomach of the ostrich, corresponding with the cardiac end of the human stomach.

808 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. not visible. Behind, below the bifurcation of the vertebral columns, there is a second breast surface with two sets of well-formed ribs and a small sternum, on dividing which the posterior edges of the lungs come into view; how many lungs there are could not be made out. The trachea is rudimentary. It appears to be of double origin, continuing double to the root of the neck, there- after it seems to be single ; this could not be determined with certainty. There is no trace of a second heart. There is a single, proportionately very large, liver. The lower part of the alimen- tary canal and the genito-urinary organs are double and distinct. It is of the male sex. The specimen is not in condition for further dissection. 50.44. Rhachipagus. Sheep. Hunterian. Monstrosity of the sheep, stuifed, new-born apparently at full time, showing a condition similar to the preceding. The anterior duplicity is slightly more extensive, four ears being present. The neck and thorax appear more decidedly single than in the preceding, the separation of the hind quarters appearing to begin further back. In its present condition further determination of the nature of the union is impossible. DIVISION II. AcARDiAC Monsters. There are in the series six monsters belonging to this order, all acephalic. As stated in the introduction to the series, mons- trosities of this description are always malformed twins, which are incapable of independent life, even within the uterus, owing to the absence of the heart. They depend for their circulation on the healthy twin, by anastomosis with its vessels in the placenta. Unfortunately none of these specimens has either a history of its birth or its placenta. Their nature, however, is quite clear. 50.45. Acephalic Acardiac Monstrosity. Human. Hunterian. MM. 56. (Peracephale.)

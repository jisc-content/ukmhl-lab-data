507 OALL STONES. formed upon one another into a number of flat surfaces. The smaller were perfectly similar to the larger and had the same appearance internally, and the same number of strata and of colours, so that it might be supposed that they were all formed at the same time. They were all, externally, of a fine dark-green colour, and sank in water even when dry. The large figure is the section magnified (the outline showing the real size). In the centre is an irregular cavity, round which are the pyramidal crystals, then the radiated yellow crystallization, vevy yellow in the middle, and lighter at the circumference, then a circle of green, then of light yellow alternately and green. Each of these with a glass was composed of many finer laminae, and the whole made of radiated lines and crystals." They are now of a yellowish colour. They belong to the pearly facetted variety of gall stones, and consist of a centre of bilirubin calcium mixed with cholesterine crystals, surrounded by a shell of dense pure cholesterine in fine laminae. Compare Nos. 52.32 and 52.33. 38.4. Black Gall Stones. From one Case. Hunte7'ian. U. 50a. "A very considerable number of black gall stones, from one gall bladder." They are of very irregular shapes and sizes, and not facetted like those of the previous specimen. Typical bilirubin calcium calculi. Compare Nos. 52.44 et seq. 38.5. Large Solitary Gall Stone. Hunterian. U. 49. A gall stone nearly as large as a hen's egg, and nearly filling the gall bladder, one side of which is removed to show it. Apparently a common gall stone like Nos. 52.35 to 52.43. 38.6. Solitary Gall Stone. Contraction of the Gall Bladder. Hunterian. ZJ. 51. "A gall bladder thickened, and contracted close upon a stone about the size of a cherry, and of a brown colour." One side of the bladder has been removed to show the stone.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 932 *53.155. Mixed Phosphate Calculi. Eunterian. Five tetrahedral calculi, of very regular shape with flat sides and clean cut edges. " Tliese stones were found in the bladder of a dog." They measure 2-6 cm. on each edge. One of them is cut; it has had a small round nucleus, which is now absent. The bulk of the stones consists of a material very like chalk in colour, hardness, and textiire. It consists largely of triple phosphates, but is very readily fusible as if it contained an appreciable admixture of the earthy phosphates. {Ilunterian Flate XX., figs 3 to 8.) 53.156. Mixed Phosphate Calculi. Hunterian. A number of small calculi, several broken, in shape and com- position closely resembling the preceding. Contain also some calcium carbonate. 53.157. Mixed Phosphate Calculi. Hunterian. Four and a half calculi of rounded shape, irregularly faceted, in composition and appearance like the preceding. 53.158. Mixed Phosphate Calculi. Hunterian (?). A small calculus very like the preceding, accompanied by a note (not Hunterian)—" calculus containing carbonate of lime, phosphate of lime, triple phosphate and uric acid " ; the last probably in the form of urates. 53.159. Mixed Phosphate and Oxalate Calculi—from the Kidney. Hunterian. Two calculi and one or two fragments showing the characteristic irregular branched shape of renal calculi. They are both composed of white mixed phosphates and dark brown calcium oxalate, with some uric acid, combined in irregular masses and layers. Not cut.

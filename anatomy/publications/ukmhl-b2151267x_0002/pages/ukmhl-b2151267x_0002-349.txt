THE BEG ID U A IN THE EslRLY MONTHS. 731 from about the middle of the fundus down to about 1 cm. from the OS internum. It forms a perfect demonstration of the nature and relations of the decidua. A piece of whalebone is passed in by the os; the orifices of the Fallopian tubes are not marked. A large piece of the front of the decidua reflexa and foetal mem- branes has been removed, and the foetus turned out, showing the cavity of the ovum. The chorion is seen lining the inside of the decidua reflexa, united to it on the non-placental area only by a few thread-like remains of villi. The amnion is turned down around the cord and lies collapsed in the lower part of the cavity of the decidua reflexa, its surface and that of the chorion, with which it had been in apposition, covered with the remains of the delicate fibrous connecting tissue. On the outside of the amnion is seen the umbilical vesicle. An exquisite specimen. 48.184. Longitudinal Section of Ovum and Decidua. Hunterian. EB. 235 One half of an ovum with decidua, in the third month, divided longitudinally showing the three parts of the latter, viz., (1) the decidua vera, separated by the cavity of the uterus from (2) the decidua reflexa, and (3) the decidua serotina or placental decidua, where the ovum is attached to the uterus. 48.185. Longitudinal Section of Ovum and Decidua " about Seven Weeks." Hunterian. RR. 236. A similar specimen, but much more perfect, hung upside down, i.e. by the cervical end, showing the same as the preceding. The embryo lies on the bottom of the jar. On the outside is seen a hole, which corresponds to the orifice of the Fallopian tube, lead- ing into the cavity of the uterus. The chorion, covered with villi, lines the interior of the decidua reflexa. 48.186. Longitudinal Section of Ovum and Decidua " about Seven Weeks." Hunterian. RR. 236a. The other half of the preceding. II. Y

CARCINOMA OF THE UTERUS. 633 rectum are dissected away, showing that the disease has destroyed the greater part of the cervix, and the vaginal walls both before and behind. On either side is a mass of infiltrated glands, that on the right extending up into the broad ligament. 45.71. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Advanced. Huntcrian. CO. 102. Another example of advanced carcinoma of the cervix of the uterus, which has caused widespread destruction of the vagina and cervix, and is fungating into the bladder. 4-5.72. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Advanced. Huntcrian. CC. 102ft. A specimen somewhat similar to the preceding, but with most of the ragged tumour tissue scraped away, to show the per- foration of the bladder. 45.73. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Advanced. Hunterian. CC. 104e. Uterus, vagina, and part of rectum, the vagina opened in front, showing extensive ulceration of the cervix and vaginal walls, with extensions of tumour into the broad ligament and recto- vaginal septum. 45.74. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Perforation into Peritoneal Cavity. Hunterian. CC. 106. The uterus, with part of the vagina and bladder, showing a comparatively small growth, which has affected the vagina very little, yet has eaten through into the bladder in front, and from behind can be seen to have almost entirely destroyed the cervix, and opened into the recto-vaginal pouch of the peritoneum. 45.75. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. CC. 106a. Uterus, vagina, and part of the bladder, showing considerable ulceration of the posterior wall of the vagina, fungation into the bladder, and large masses of affected glands at the sides of the cervix and extending into the broad ligaments.

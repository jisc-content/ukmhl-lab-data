William Hunter says of this little pit or cicatricula on the outside of the corpus luteum : " In the cases which I have seen no bristles would pass; it appears to be an obliterated duct or passage grown together." It is not a passage, but only a depression, a scar, corresponding to the point at which the Graafian follicle ruptured. {Lectures, MS. R.C.S.EDg.) 48.55. Corpus Luteum of Pregnancy and False Corpus Luteum. Hunterian. BR. 48. '•A section of corpus luteum, highly injected red. The cavity is white and carries no vessels apparentlj', but the surrounding glandular substance is as vascular as any thing in the body; at some little distance are seen the remains of a former corpus luteum, in which the glandular substance is lost, and the mere cavity remains." The appearance of the latter body strongly suggests that it is not a " former corpus luteum," but a so-called false corpus luteum of Dal ton, i.e. a Graafian follicle which has not ruptured, but has degenerated and remained buried in the stroma of the ovary.

" Fallopian tube and ovary, from a woman who died undelivered (at Knightsbridge); she died of her third child; ovarium is slit open ; there are three corpora lutea—one recent and two old ones; the first has a very large cavity." The appearances do not warrant the above description. There is one corpus luteum, probably related to the pregnancy, but the other two bodies appear to be simply, the upper a large Graafian follicle, and the lower a false corpus luteum of Dalton—an unruptured and degenerated Graafian

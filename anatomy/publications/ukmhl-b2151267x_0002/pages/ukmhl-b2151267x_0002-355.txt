737 THE EMBRYO IN THE EARLY MONTHS. showing a fine cord rising from the mesentery, which is remains of the above. The umbilical arteries and urachus well dissected. Injected red. (6) The Size of the Foetus at Different Periods of Gestation. Here, as perhaps less particularly in other parts of the collection, the effect of the jar in magnifying the contained specimen must be remembered. A proper idea of its size can often be obtained by looking down on it through the glass cover. 48.201. Embryo of " about Six Weeks." Hunterian. lili. 251. " A child about six weeks, Avith part of the amnion preserved, and a very distinct vesicula alba." Compare section Development of the Ovum, Kos. 48.165 et seq. Nos. 48.165 and 48.166 are rather younger than this and the following specimens. In this the umbilical vesicle is very small. The allantois is not recog- nizable. The head has fallen away from the body, tearing the neck and spoiling the relations of parts. The branchial clefts are still very apparent; there is a very large oral cavity, and two little nasal fossae. The anterior thoracic wall is a thin transparent membrane, through which can be seen the heart and lungs. The groove of division of the heart into its two sides is distinct. The lungs are seen as a pah" of little buds, one on either side of the aorta. There are faint indications of the digits in the buds of the fore limbs. The vertebral column can be traced through the transparent tissues. The caudal extremity is enclosed but decidedly prominent. In front of it is a prominent tubercle, the genital tubercle ; compare Series 51, Embryological Wax Models. 48.202. Embryo of Seven or Eight Weeks. Presented by Professor Young. An abortion with thick fibrinous walls, laid open, showing an embryo slightly more advanced than the preceding. Shows the segmentation of the vertebral column, and the eye, as a distinct black ring with a white centre, on the side of the head.

EMBRYOLOGY. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHLCK. 843 51.10. Development of the Insect from the Ovum. (After Weissmann.) From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. Twenty-six wax models illustrating the development of the egg of the Chironomus (Diptera: Insects). Magnified 500 diameters. After the work of Weissmann, Die Entwickelung der Dipteren (Development of the Diptera). II. The Development of the Embryo and of Special Organs. Nos. 51.11 to 51.16 are a set of six cases, containing a set of twenty-three wax models, illustrative of the development of the chick. Presented to the Museum by Dr. Allen Thomson. The full explanation of them will be found in the work of Professor His, Untersuchungen liber die erste Anlage des Wirbelthierleihes (Researches into the First Development of the Vertebrates), Leipzig, 1868, to which the references to pages apply. The brief descriptions here given are founded on the descriptions in that work, p. 57, where a list of the stages is given. 51.11. Development of the Chick. (After His.) From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. Models 1, 2, and 3 : Stages 3, 4, and 5. The First Stage is the differentiation of the layers of the blastoderm. Second Stage. First appearance of the folding-off of the embryonic area, formation of the primitive streak, central cross streak, its crescentic anterior margin, and medullary folds. These two stages are not represented by models ; some of the points are illustrated in Model 1. Model 1. Third Stage. (His.) Sharper differentiation of the embryonic portion from the rest (extra-embryonic portion) of the blastoderm. Differentiation of the lateral plates of the mesoblast (muscle plates). Commencement of organization of the inner layer of the embryo. 18-23 hours. (Page 68 et seq.) Model 2. Fourth Stage. Development of the head fold. Divi- sion of the mesoblast into splanchnopleure and somatopleure. Elevation of the medullary ridges and formation of the first n. 2 F

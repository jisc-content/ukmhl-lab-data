623 MYOMA OF THE UTERUS. UTERINE MYOMATA; "FIBROIDS." 45.30. Myomata of the Uterus. Interstitial. Hunterian. CC. 67a. The uppermost of " three sections transversely of the same uterus, scirrhous and enlarged to the size of a gravid uterus at six months; there was a foetid discharge and hectic fever; it was in a milliner about forty-five, who was also a maid." This specimen consists of the fundus of the uterus. In section it shows several small interstitial myomata, from 1 to 2'5 cm. in diameter. It is figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. IX., PI. II., fig. 2, and described as " transverse section of a scirrhous uterus." No. 675 is absent; No. 67c is now No. 45.83; it shows the cervix much enlarged and its cavity filled with a ragged growth, which microscopic examination shows to be an ulcerating epithelioma of the cervix, which explains the discharge. The cavity of this specimen is enlarged and contains a quantity of ulcerated looking tissue similar to the tumour in the cervix. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 138.) 45.31. Myomata of the Uterus. Interstitial. Hunterian. CC. 70d. Uterus, with the posterior wall of the bladder; a cut has been made into the front of the body of the uterus, and the anterior part turned up, showing in section a myoma, which, with one or two other small ones, had produced ? considerable enlargement of the organ. 45.32. Myoma of the Uterus. Interstitial tending to become Subserous. Hunterian. CC. 66. Uterus and appendages, the uterus split from back to front, showing a m3'oma, about 3 cm. in diameter, growing outwards in the posterior wall of the fundus uteri. 45.33. Myoma of the Uterus.

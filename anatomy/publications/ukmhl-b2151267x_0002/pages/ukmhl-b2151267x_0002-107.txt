TUBERCULAR ULCERS OF THE INTESTINES. 489 36. 80. Tubercular Ulcers of the Solitary Follicles of the Intestine. Hunterian. II. 33. Two pieces of intestine showing the above. "The ulceration seems to begin always in a follicle, or amongst a cluster of follicles." The follicle seems to have swollen, and then broken down in- ternally, and been discharged through a hole in the centre, leaving a cavity with thin overhanging edges of mucous membrane. They appear to be tubercular. The succeeding specimens from the same case are more typical tubercular ulcers. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 97.) ("Dr. Stark.") 36.81. Tubercular Ulcers of the Intestine. Hunterian. B. 34. Three pieces of intestine, showing ulceration of Peyer's patches, from the same case as the preceding. 36.82. Tubercular Ulcers of the Intestine. Fibrous Ad- hesions over the External Surface. Hunterian. B. 35, Another portion of intestine from the same case, showing ulcers in the Peyer's patches, and a long fibrous adhesion depending from the base of an ulcer externally. 36.83. Tubercular Ulcers of the Intestine. Fibrous Ad- hesions on the Peritoneum. Hunterian. B. 36. Similar to the preceding. 36.84. Tubercular Ulcers of the Intestine. Fibrous Ad- hesions of the Peritoneum. Hunterian. B. 37. Similar to the preceding. 36.85. Tubercular Ulcer of the Intestine. Hunterian. B. 38. Another portion of the same intestine, showing the ulceration in a Peyer's patch, and extending from it in the direction round the bowel, and giving rise to considerable constriction. As in the

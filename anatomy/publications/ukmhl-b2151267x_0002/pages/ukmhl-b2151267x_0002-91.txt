HERNIA. 473 gave me great perplexity; it was at first considered as an obstruc- tion of the liver, and deobstruents prescribed; the gentler failing, recourse was had to a pt3'alism raised by the unguentum coeruleum rubbed over the part, mercurial plasters, and small doses of calomel by the mouth. Towards the end of this course, the worm was scarcely felt for some weeks. When we perceived matter under the intercostal muscles, we advised laying the parts open, but the patient would not submit to it." The disease was probably a large hydatid of the liver.

" Peritoneum as it covered the abdominal muscles on the inside of Poupart's ligament, and went out to form a hernial sac, which is now seen empty and open." 36.17. Omentum, which formed the contents of the pre- ceding Hernia. Hunterian. P. 71. 36.18. Sac of an Inguinal (Scrotal) Hernia. Hunterian. P. 74. 'â€¢ The peritoneum, as it formed a sac of a hernia in the groin, laid open; it is about five inches long and two wide; Poupart's ligament is seen at the upper edge on the forepart, and on the back part of the lower end is the testicle in its own tunica vaginalis; the epidydimis was in a state of suppuration at the end next vas deferens." 36.19. Inguinal Hernia with Hydrocele. Hunterian. F. 61. The sac of an inguinal hernia, and the tunica vaginalis of the testicle, in which there had been a small accumulation of fluid, laid open in front, showing the relation of the hernial sac to the tunica vaginalis and testicle. In this case the lower end of the hernial sac seems to pass down a little way between the tunica vaginalis and the elements of the spermatic cord, which are visible behind.

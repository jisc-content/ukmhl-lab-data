CALCIUM OXALATE CALCULI 921 one end to the other, leaving two considerable areas of the sides in which the points of the oxalate stone are bare. Nucleus : urate of ammonium. {Hunterian Plate XIV., figs. 5 and 6.) 53.104. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a large oval stone cut across. It consists of a spherical mulberry calculus about the size of a marble, with small urate of ammonium nucleus and a ver}' thick outer shell of pure uric acid. Its exterior is smooth. There is a very distinct boundary between the oxalate portion and the uric acid portion, in the form of an irregular space, which contains some fibrinous debris and mixed phosphates. 53.105. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A large flattened oval stone cut longitudinally, showing exactly the same structure as the preceding. The uric acid part contains traces of calcium oxalate; its exterior is finely tuberculated. 53.106. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. An oval stone about the size of a hen's egg. It has a central mass, of considerable size, of granular uric acid ; then a broad zone, which is partly laminated, partly in irregular masses and bands, consisting of uric acid and a very large proportion of calcium oxalate. Outside this is a fairly thick layer of dense laminated uric acid with traces of oxalate. The exterior of the stone is very roughly tuberculated. 53.107. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A somewhat smaller flattened oval stone having a small calcium oxalate calculus for its nucleus, and from that outwards consisting of uric acid and a very large proportion of calcium oxalate in very fine close laminae. It is an extremely hard stone. Its exterior

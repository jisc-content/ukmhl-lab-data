DISEASES OF THE CHORION AND AMNION. 767 49.31. Hydatidiform Degeneration of the Chorion. Hiinterian. RR. 395. 49.32. Hydatidiform Degeneration of the Chorion. Hunterian. RR. 397. " A considerable hydatid, with some smaller ones growing from its surface, showing mode of formation." 49.33. Hydatidiform Degeneration of the Chorion. Hunterian. RR. 398. 49.34. Hydatidiform Degeneration of the Chorion. Hunterian. RR. 399. 49.35. Hydatidiform Degeneration of the Chorion. Hunterian. RR. 400. (c) Hydramnios. 49.36. Chorion from a Miscarriage. Hydramnios. Hunterian. (Not described; found among the Hunterian specimens.) A chorionic sac about the size of a tennis ball. It hangs by a layer of decidua, which is left covering its upper parts. This decidua is partly split into two layers. The chorion is clear and transparent; over its whole surface it is covered with villi, which are unusually long and branching, and set so far apart that each is quite distinct from its neighbour. The umbilical cord is attached to clear membrane between villi in an area where they are few and far between, there being nowhere any aggregation of them into a placenta. The embryo is about 2 cm. long, and is malformed. There is no distinct amnionic sac surrounding it, as is usual at such an early stage as its size indicates. Apparently amnion and chorion are fused together. This fact and the very abnormally large size of the amnio-chorionic sac in proportion to the embryo seem to indicate a condition of hydramnios. The

TRII'Li: PHOSPHATE CONCRETIONS. S87 contained in wiieat, oats, hay, etc., and this opinion derives confirma- tion from the circumstance that they occur most frequently in millers' and brewers' horses which are fed on grains and bran, substances known to contain a much larger proportion of magnesian salts than other A'egetable matters." 52.109. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Horse. Himterian. All intestinal concretion supposed to be from a horse, cut. It is uf tetrahedral shape with rounded angles. It measures 11 cm. in its largest diameter. It is of the colour of dark gray free- stone. The outei' surface and some of the laminae show traces of crystallization. It is of soft chalky consistence, fairly easily fusible before the blowpipe ; it consists principally of the triple phosphate (of magnesium and ammonium), but contains also a considei'able proportion of earthy phosphates. It also contains a large amount of organic matter, part of which is the hair of oat seed. Its nucleus is a small pebble. 52.110. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Eunterian. A similar calculus, uncut. 52. 111. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Huuterian. A similar calculus of much smaller size, broken. It shows throughout a crystalline tendency, and the centre is distinctly composed of radiating crystals. The outer parts are finely laminated. Part of it has also split into thick shells, each consisting of several of the finer laminae. Compare Nos. 52.123 et seq. 52.112. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A small concretion 7-5 cm. in diameter, of spherical shape, flattened on two sides. A thick shell has been split off one of the rounded sides. 52.113. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A spherical concretion 9 cm. in diameter, cut and ground. It consists of triple phosphate with traces of earthy phosphates and carbonates. Nucleus a small pebble.

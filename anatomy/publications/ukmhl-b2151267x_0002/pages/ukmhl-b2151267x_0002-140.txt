Foetal Kidney to show Lobulation. Hunterian. X. 20. "Foetal human kidney lobulated like the bear's, though it afterwards becomes simple like the lion's. The arteries injected red, the veins black." Compare Comparative Anatomy specimens, Nos. 40.42 to 40.45. 40.5. Foetal Kidney showing Lobulation and the Mamillae. Hunterian. X 21. A similar kidney divided longitudinally, showing the lobulation, and the mamillae or nipples, one to each lobule, projecting into the calyces of the pelvis. 40.6. The Kidney of a Young Subject, showing the Mamillae. Hunterian. X. 219. The lobulation has now disappeared, but traces of it remain in the distinct mamillae. 40.7. The Cortex and Medulla of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 22. Kidney, boiled and divided in longitudinal antero-posterior section, to show that it consists of (1) an outer lighter-coloured part called the cortex, which consists of the secreting apparatus, and (2) central lobules or "pyramids of the medulla," which are composed chiefly of the collecting tubules or excretory ducts of the uriniferous tubules, gathered together into nipple-like processes which project into the calyces of the pelvis. 40.8. The Cortex and Medulla of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 23. The remaining portion of the preceding.

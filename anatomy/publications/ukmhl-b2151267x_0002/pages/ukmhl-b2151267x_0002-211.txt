593 TUMOURS OF THE BLABBER, 43.56. " Ossifications of the Body of the Testicle." Hunterian. Y. 72. A testicle, with the vas deferens injected with mercury, dried, and mounted in turpentine. The organ, by drying and immersion in turpentine, is made to resemble a piece of clear horn, in which appear a couple of white osseous or calcareous nodules, " about the size of the end of one's finger." Nature unknown; possibly old tubercular or syphilitic deposits or even parasites, dead and in- filtrated with lime salts. 43.57. " Ossifications of the Body of the Testicle." Hunterian. X. 73. Similar to the preceding; the supposed osseous nodules rather smaller. V. Tumours of the Bladder and Male Genital Organs. 43.58. Projections of the Mucous Membrane of the Bladder. Papillomatous (?). Hunterian. AA. 30. " A bladder inverted, to show its inner coat produced at several parts into laminae, or processes of a quarter of an inch above the surface; these might be laid hold of along with the stone in litho- tomy, and occasion dreadful symptoms." Microscopic examination â€”the tissue is very much degenerated, but the appearances suggest papillomata. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 132.) 43.58a. Recurrent Papilloma of the Bladder, removed by Operation. Presented by Dr. John Edgar, 1898. A number of irregularly-shaped rounded pieces of tissue of a greyish-white colour. Their interior is partly papillated, partly smooth from being enclosed in a fine fibrous capsule. In section they are seen to consist of long branching papillae, closely packed together. The base of the growth is not recognizable in the pieces, but there is seen to be a certain amount of a central solid core, from which the papillae spring. With the microscope the papillae are found to consist of a thin core of fibrous tissue, containing a consi- derable number of blood-vessels, sheathed with very thick stratified epithelium. The deeper cells of this are columnar in shape, the

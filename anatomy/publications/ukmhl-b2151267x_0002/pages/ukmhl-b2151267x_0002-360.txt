742 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48.223. The Viscera in a Foetus about Seven Months. Hunterian. IIIL 350a. Similar to the preceding but larger; part of the umbilical cord attached. 48.224. Foetus in the Seventh Month. Hunterian. BR. 308. A male foetus slightly larger than the preceding; the scrotum well formed, but the testicles not descended. 48.225. Foetus in the Seventh Month. Hunierian. RR. 309. Similar to the preceding. 48.226. Foetus in the Seventh Month. Hunterian. RR. 310. Similar to the preceding. So exactly do these three resemble one another, it seems possible that they were triplets. 48.227. The Muscles in a Foetus between Seven and Eight Months. Hunterian. RR. 311. A female foetus, considerably larger than the preceding, "with the integument from the right half of the body taken off, showing the superficial muscles." Beautifully dissected. The clitoris is now comparatively small, but still shows distinctly between the labia majora. 48.228. Foetus and Placenta at Full Time, mounted in the Natural Intrauterine Position. Hunterian. RR. 91a. (Not described.) A full time female foetus and placenta, mounted in a large jar as described above. The limbs are folded upon the body, the placenta towards the front and right side of the body and limbs of the foetus, and a turn of the cord round its neck. The cord does not appear to be unduly long; the turn round the neck would consequently have been a complication of some moment during delivery.

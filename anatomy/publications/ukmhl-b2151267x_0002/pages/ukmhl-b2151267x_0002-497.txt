OAT SEED CONCRETIONS. 879 *52.81. Oat Seed and Mixed Phosphate Concretion. Hnnterian. Half of a somewhat similar calculus. It is of roughly cubical shape, measuring 4 cm. on the side. Its exterior is of dark brown colour, faceted and polished, and consists of very dense hard phosphatic matter. The cut surface is of a brown colour, marked with concentric lines, due to its being formed in fine laminae varying in breadth and in hardness—soft where the vegetable hairs, and very hard where the earthy matter predominates. The earthy matter is a mixture of phosphates of calcium and magnesium, the former predominating. The centre is a large fruit stone. (Hnnterian Flute III., figs. 7 and 8.) 52.82. Oat Seed and Mixed Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. Halves of a similar concretion of oval shape and rough on the out- side. *52.83. Oat Seed and Mixed Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. The halves of a similar concretion of small size and irregular shape, with several polished facets on its exterior. {Huntenan Plate III., figs. .5 and 6.) 52.84. Oat Seed and Mixed Phosphate Concretion. Hmterian. The halves of a similar calculus. {Hnnterian Plate III., figs. 10 and 11.) *52. 85. Oat Seed Concretion. Hunterian. A very large concretion of the same class, composed of vegetable hairs like those of the oat seed, nearly pure for the largest part of the concretion, but towards the outside mixed with phosphatic matter. It is of irregularly rounded short oval shape, measuring about 12 by 9 cm.—about as big as the foetal head at term. (Hmterian Plate IV., figs. 1 and 2.)

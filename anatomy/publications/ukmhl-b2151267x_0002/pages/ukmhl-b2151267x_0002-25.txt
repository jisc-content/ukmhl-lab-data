COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE TEETH. 407 29.54. The Formation and Growth of the Teeth, Hunterian. PP. 62. Nine growing teeth similar to the preceding. Mounted dry on blue paper. 29.55. The Shedding of the Deciduous Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 66. Nine teeth of the first dentition, the roots more or less gone, having been absorbed in the process of shedding (compare 29.47, et seq., and 29.63-64). The absorption has gone furthest in the centre of the teeth, leaving a sharp edge round the outside. They mostly show a crust of tartar round the neck, and two of them traces of caries also. Mounted dry on blue paper. 29.56. Third Dentition. Hunterian. PP. 75. "An upper jaw from an old head; bicuspides and molares in situ, incisors and former cuspidati gone; two third set cuspidati are seen very large, their points just to be felt in the roof of the mouth." Comparative Anatomy of the Teeth. 29.57. Transverse Section of a Horse's Tooth. Hunterian. PP. 16. A horse's tooth ground down to show the enamel not on the outside and top as in man, but in irregularly convoluted ridges alternating with the dentine, which lies bare between the ridges. This gives a rough ridged surface for grinding the hard vegetable food. Dry on blue paper. 29.58. Transverse Section of Horse's Tooth. Hunterian. PP. 17. Similar preparation stained with nitrate of silver. 29.59. Transverse and Vertical Sections of Horse's Tooth. Hunterian. Similar to the preceding, and also showing that the enamel ridges are formed from above and extend only a certain distance

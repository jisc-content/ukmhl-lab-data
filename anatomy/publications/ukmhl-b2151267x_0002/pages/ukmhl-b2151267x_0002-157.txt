RENAL CALCULUS. 539 large branching calculus, of dark colour externally, internally yellowish. There is considerable atrophy of the apices of the pyramids, leaving spaces around the ends of the processes of the calculus. The pelvis does not grasp it tightly, and the ureter is patent (part of a bougie is placed in it), so that the urine has been able to escape. The other kidney was occupied by a similar calculus. They are both composed of uric acid and calcium oxalate, the latter forming the dark outer crust. See succeeding specimen. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.24. Large Branched Renal Calculus. Hunterian. X. 101. The kidney "from the other side, in the same woman" (as No. 41.23). "Old; in the dissecting room." The branches of the calculus are hardly so large, but the body of it fills the pelvis more completely. There is much greater dilatation of the calyces, and more atrophy of the renal tissue. A bougie is placed in the ureter. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. VI., PI. v., fig. 1.) 41.25. Renal Calculus. Atrophy of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 102. Part of a kidney injected red, showing a ramifying calculus embedded in the lower part of the kidney, leaving the pelvis clear. The atrophy around the stone is very considerable. The pelvis is somewhat dilated, and the pyramids in the upper part also of the organ are atrophied. The cause of this is not apparent. The calculus is composed of mixed phosphates, and presents in parts a crystalline appearance. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.26. Numerous Calculi in the Kidney. Pyonephrosis. Hunterian. X. 101a. "A very large kidney quite filled with stones and pus, the cavities containing both laid open." The stones lie deeply em- bedded in the kidney, many of the cavities extending to the external surface. They are of a mottled brown and white colour, and composed of mixed phosphates. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) II. K

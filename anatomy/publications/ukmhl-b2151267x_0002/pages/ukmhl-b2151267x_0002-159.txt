541 TUBERCULOSIS OF THE KIDNEY. glandular tissue at one end: the pelvis is dilated. " From the dissecting room." Compare next specimen. 41.33. Tuberculosis of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 113. Half of the other kidney from the same subject as the preced- ing, showing the tubercular destruction of the organ considerably further advanced. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. VI., PI. IV., fig. 1, where it is described as " scrofulous.") 41.34. Tuberculosis of the Kidney. Cicatricial Con- traction. Hunterian. X. 93. Part of a kidney split open showing its lower end converted into a series of tubercular abscess cavities. They are enclosed in a thin fibrous rind, and a number of tubercular masses project from the outer surface. The capsule of the kidney has been torn off, leaving a rough fibrous surface. There are a number of simple retention cysts in the organ. 41.35. Tuberculosis of the Kidney and Ureter. Advanced, Hunterian. X. 92. One half of a kidney, which, with the ureter, has been carefully split, showing an advanced stage of the above disease. The kidney is converted into a series of cavities, communicating with one another, lined by caseating tubercular granulations. The proper renal tissue is almost completely destroyed. The tubercular process extends right down the ureter, the cavity of which is also filled with caseous debris. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 100.) 41.36. Tuberculosis of the Kidney and Ureter. Advanced. Hunterian. X. 92a. The other half of the preceding. (Matthew Baillie's Engrav- ings, Fasc. VI., PI. IV., fig. 2. Described as " scrofulous.") 41.37. Tuberculosis of the Kidney. Very Advanced. Hunterian. X. 93ffl. A kidney somewhat shrunk, and rendered irregular by cicatrices, laid open on one side to show that it was reduced to a series of

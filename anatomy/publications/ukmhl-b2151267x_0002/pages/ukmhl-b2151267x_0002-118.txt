SERIES 37. ANATOMY OF THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. The Liver, 1-9 The Gall Bladder and Bile Duds, . . . .10-15 The Pancreas, . . . . . . . .16-19 Comparative Anatomy Specimens, .... 20-23 37.1. The Liver of a Child at Birth. Htmterian. U. 1 Highly injected red; suspended by the vena cava, so as to exhibit the upper, convex, and the under, concave, surfaces, and its lobula- tion and shape. On the upper surface is seen the falciform ligament, and the notch of the fissure for the umbilical vein, marking the boundary of the right and left lobes. On the under surface appears, about the middle, the portal fissure running transversely to the body, with the vessels entering it. The fissure for the umbilical vein passes from the anterior edge of the liver to the left end of the portal fissure, and is continued as the fissure for the ductus venosus back to the vena cava, the two together forming the longi- tudinal fissure. The fissure of the gall bladder, with the bladder lying contracted in it, runs forward from the right end of the portal fissure. The area between the last and the longitudinal fissure is called lobus quadratus. The small posterior surface looks upwards and bacTiwards; it shows the vena cava with the lobulus Spigelii between it and the fissure for the ductus venosus, and the lobus caudatus at its lower edge, running outwards to the right lobe. 37.2. The Liver and Gall Bladder of a Child. Hunterian. U. la. Injected red, and the peritoneum stripped off.

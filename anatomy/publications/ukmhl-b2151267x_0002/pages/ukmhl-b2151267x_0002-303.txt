THE HUMAN OVUM. 685 SECTION II. The Contents of the Pregnant Uterus : Foetus, Membranes, AND Placenta—the Human Ovum. («) Entire Human Ovum. 48.73. "A Child at Birth, enclosed in its Amnion, with its Placenta, giving an idea of an Entire Human Ovum." Hunterian. EE. 65. Apparently, from the size of the foetus, about the seventh month. "The vessels of the placenta, unravelled and hanging loose and floating," the maternal decidua between them having been removed by maceration and teasing, leaving almost purely foetal tissues. " The contents of the pregnant uterus are the secundines, liquor amnii, and the foetus. The secundines make the lining of the uterus and the immediate covering of the child; they form the chain of connection and communication between the bodies of the mother and child, and carry on that wonderful influence upon which the life and health of the child depends. There is an obvious division of them into the navel string, the placenta, and the membranes." (Description of the Gravid Uterus, p. 27.) 48.74. Complete Human Ovum: Foetus, Amnion, Chorion, and Placenta. Hunteriaji. EE. 66. A similar specimen mounted in a globular glass jar with flat glass top. " Exceedingly perfect: chorion also adhering, but removed at one part to show amnion more transparent underneath, and foetus more distinct under it." About the seventh month; slightly larger than the preceding. It is very surprising that such a large ovum should have escaped rupture of the membranes in its expulsion from the womb. 48.75. Complete Human Ovum. Hunterian. RE. &la. The contents of the uterus, " at full time or nearly so." The foetal membranes, chorion and amnion are split and slightly retracted to show the foetus suspended by the head. Its limbs

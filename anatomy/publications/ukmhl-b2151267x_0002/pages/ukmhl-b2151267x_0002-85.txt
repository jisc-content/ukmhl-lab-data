DIVERTICULUM ILEI. 467 36.4. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 57. A portion of the intestine from a child, showing a short diverticulum, about the same width as the intestine, rising from its side. Its orifice is oblique, and valved like the preceding. 36.5. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's, Hunterian. P. 58. Dried. From an adult. It is about 10 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter—rather less than the intestine, from the side of which it springs. One edge of its orifice is valve-like. The intestine just below it bends at an acute angle, apparently natural. There is a sharp edge, which stands up about 5 mm., between it and the diverticulum, making a partial septum of the bowel. 36.6. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 59. A portion of the intestine from a child, injected red, inflated, coiled and dried, showing a diverticulum of the same calibre as the gut, and about 3 cm. long. It rises from the side of the intestine, and at one side of its orifice is a partial septum, simi- lar to that seen in the preceding, but rather better developed. 36.7. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 60. A piece of the intestine, inflated and dried, showing a large diverticulum about 3 cm. long, and bifid at its extremity. It rises from the side of the gut. 36.8. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Htmterian. P. 61. It is about 4 cm. long, similar in diameter to the intestine, and rises from the free edge of the bowel opposite the insertion of the mesentery. Inflated and dried. 36.9. Diverticulum Ilei. Meckel's. Hunterian. P. 62. From a new-born child. It is rather less in width than the intestine, and about three times as long as it is broad. It rises •opposite the insertion of the mesentery.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 556 Arl. 43. The Rete Testis and Epididymis injected with Mercury. Huntciian. Y. 30. A somewhat similar but much less beautiful preparation, in which the tubules have been removed from one side to show the network of larger vessels in the mediastinum, called the rete testis, into which they open, and from which the epididymis originates b}'' the vasa efiferentia. See succeeding specimens, especially No. 42.45. 42.44. "The Tubuli, Rete, Epididymis, and Vas Deferens." Hunterian. Y. 31. " Injected with mercury. The testicle was a small one, and the tubuli appear few, but unravelled and hanging down four or five inches, to show that the preparations 26 and 27 (the preceding) were really those of unravelled tubuli : spread on blue paper: changed in 1778, and length of tubes now less as parts broke off in removing." Fresh turpentine, 1896. No further damage done. 42.45. Testicle injected with Mercury by the Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 32. A similar preparation to No. 42.42, dried and mounted in turpentine. The tubules are very well filled and the straight tubes in which they end can be traced into the network (rete testis) of the mediastinum. From the upper end of that the efferent vessels, five or six in number, are seen to rise. These become convoluted and form a number of conical masses of duct called coni vasculosi, which terminate in a single tube whose convolutions form the epididymis. This passes back to the lower end of the testis, whence it is con- tinued as a convoluted tube with larger calibre and thicker walls called the vas deferens. 42.46. Testicle injected with Mercury by the Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 33. Similar to the preceding, but only the beginning of the tubes- filled. Dried and mounted in turpentine on black paper. 42.47. Testicle injected with Mercury by the Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 33 (2).. Similar to the preceding. Dried and in turpentine.

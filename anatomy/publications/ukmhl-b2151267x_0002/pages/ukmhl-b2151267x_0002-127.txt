PANCREATIC CALCULI. 509 appear slightly dilated, and the cystic duct obstructed at its com- mencement by a number of small facetted gall stones. The gall bladder is contracted to little more than the thickness of a pencil, and contains numerous minute calculi. 38.12, Ulceration of the Gall Bladder by Calculi. Per- foration. Effusion of Bile into the Peritoneum. Hunterian. U. ilg. Part of the gall bladder " of a gentlewoman who died in Portman Square; the gall stones ulcerated their way through the bladder, and the bile was poured out into the peritoneum." The mucous membrane is deeply eroded in several places, and there is one small perforation. The gall stones are absent. 38.13. Pancreatic Calculi. Hunterian. W. 10. Pancreas with part of the duodenum, laid open, showing the organ converted into a loculated cyst containing numerous irregular white concretions. The secreting structures of the gland appear to be quite destroyed, and the organ is considerably below the natural size. It was found by John Hunter at a post-mortem examination. (Figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. V., The specimen consists of the wall of a very large " cyst," occupying the whole upper and back part of the liver. It is inverted to show the lining, which has the appearance of granu- lations. The unaffected part of the liver, comprising a strip of about 10 by 6 cm. of the anterior edge, and a thin layer of under surface, is seen doubled up within the inverted cyst. The diaphragm adheres over nearly the whole surface of the cyst, in intimate connection with its thick fibrous wall. Microscopic examination showed the structure of'an abscess wall. (MS.

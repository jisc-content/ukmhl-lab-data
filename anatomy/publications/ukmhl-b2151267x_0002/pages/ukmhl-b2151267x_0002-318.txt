700 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48.110. The Decidua. Hunterian. RR. 117. " A portion of uterus, including the cervix; showing five or six laminae of decidua, besides amnion and chorion." The specimen is from a uterus a considerable time before term. There is a considerable cavity between the decidua vera and the outside of the decidua reflexa opposite the os. Elsewhere their coalescence is complete. (Contrast No. 48.176.) The continuity of the decidua vera with the mucous membrane of the cervix is very distinct. The decidua is a quite thick opaque membrane. (Contrast No. 48.108.) 48.111. Decidua, Placenta, and Cervix at the Sixth Month. Hunterian. RR. 122. "A section of the uterus about the sixth month; showing the placenta and membranes adhering; the different structure of the placenta from the uterus; but, especially, that the cervix uteri does not contain any part of the ovum, but is as narrow and con- tracted as in the unimpregnated uterus." (Compare Nos. 48.44 to 48.50.) The specimen also illustrates the thinning out of the decidua as pregnancy advances, and the coalescence of its two layers. From about the middle of the uterus the decidua reflexa has not yet united firmly with the decidua vera; it has been raised up, and appears as a thin opaque covering to the chorion. The passage of the vera into the mucous membrane of the cervix is very distinct and evident. A beautiful specimen. 48.112. The Decidua, Placenta, and Condition of the Cervix at the Sixth Month. Hunterian. RR. 123. "A section of the same uterus, showing the same circumstances, together with the foetus attached to the placenta by the navel- string." A beautiful specimen. 48.113. The Decidua in the Fifth Month. Hunterian. RR. 131. Posterior half of the "uterus of the eleventh subject, in the beginning of the fifth month." The remainder of this constitutes specimens Nos. 48.153 and 48.154. The arteries and veins are injected different colours. " On its inside the decidua appears an

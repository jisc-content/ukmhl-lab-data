CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. 511 38.20. Cirrhosis of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 36. A small portion of the liver showing the above. The condition is advanced, and the outer surface shows very typically the "hobnailed" appearance, and the cut surface the bands of new- formed fibrous tissue between the lobules. "From a highly jaundiced subject" â€” the jaundice probably resulting from a superadded attack of acute hepatitis or catarrh of the bile ducts. 38.21. Cirrhosis of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 37. Another slice of the same liver showing the same condition, but less distinctly, 38.22. Cirrhosis of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 38. Another portion of the liver, said to be from the same case as No. 38.20. The outer surface is less nodulated, and the fibrous septa are less pronounced in the cut surface, but on the whole the condition is the same. 38.23. Cirrhosis of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 38a. " A portion of Mr. K 's liver, who died dropsical; it cut like cartilage, and was white and tuberculated. The absorbents (lymphatics) on its surface very large; one of these, almost the size of a goose quill, is seen full of mercury. He drank hard and had been very strong; was also a few months before in full vigour as a man." The condition is very similar to the preceding. Mounted in turpentine. 38.24. Cirrhosis of the Liver.

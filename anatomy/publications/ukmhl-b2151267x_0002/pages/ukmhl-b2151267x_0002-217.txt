THE VULVA AND HYMEN. 599 44.6. The External Genitals in a Female Child "about Four Years Old." Runterian. CC. 8. Similar parts to the preceding; injected red ; bristles in the urethra and vagina. 44.7. The External Genitals in a Female Child "at Four Years." The Hymen. Htmterian. CC. 10. "The labia, vestibuliim, and vagina extended as much as possible, to show the true shape of hymen, which is that of a crescent with the horns turned towards the sides of meatus urinae." Compare No. 3 of this series. This specimen also shows very clearly the sharp edge of the fourchette, and the fossa between it and the outside of the hymen called fossa navicularis. 44.8. The External Genitals of the Female " at Six or Eight Years." Hunterian. CC. 11. Similar to the preceding but a little larger. The labia majora, which have been widely separated, are much more developed, and the labia minora and deeper parts more under cover of them than in the preceding specimens. Compare also No. 44.14. 44.9. The External Genitals of a Full Grown Woman. Hunterian. CC. 14. The above " from a full-grown subject ; the hymen less perfect, and will easily allow a finger to pass; however, enough appears to make it probable that she was never deflowered. The rete mucosum in this subject is very dark; it appears to pass on the inside of the labia, over the nymphae, and is lost on their inner edge, and on the inner edge of the preputium clitoridis, but does not cover the gians clitoridis, meatus urinae, or hymen." There is very little hair on the parts, which, in other respects, are those of an adult. 44.10. The External Genitals of an Adult Woman. Hunterian. CC. 14a. Similar to the preceding. "Although the opening is large, yet the hymen appears perfect." It forms a crescentic margin round the back of the vaginal orifice ; this is the most common form of the hymen. Compare Nos. 44.3 and 44.7.

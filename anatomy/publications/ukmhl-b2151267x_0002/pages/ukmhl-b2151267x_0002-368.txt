HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 750 4-8.253. Allantois, probably of a Ruminant. Hunterian. RR. 339. This specimen, by some strange slip, is described in the old catalogue as " an amnion filled with spirits and its vessels injected with quicksilver"; surely not an error of William Hunter, who was familiar with the allantois in quadrupeds, though he denied its existence in the human subject. It is undoubtedly an allantois, probably from one of the ruminants, in which the organ attains a large size. See under Nos. 48.242 and 48.256, and in the introduction. 48.254. Allantois, probably of a Ruminant. Hunterian RR. 340. A similar but much larger specimen, fully as large as the foetal head at term, its vessels injected with mercury, blown up, dried, and mounted in turpentine. 4-8.255. Allantois, probably of a Ruminant. Hunterian. A large sac with pedicle, evidently the same structure as the preceding; Hunterian, but not numbered nor described. It is larger than the preceding. The blood-vessels are injected red, and it is mounted in the usual way in spirit. It appears to be formed of an opaque fairly thick and fairly vascular membrane. The pedicle is laid open, its middle segment is expanded into a considerable bag with a very much plicated lining, not unlike the mucous membrane of the urinary bladder, and the segment distal from the sac is a thin membranous tube, in which a bougie is placed. Probably the bag and tube are the urinar}' bladder and part of the urethra, which during intrauterine life are continuous with the allantois. 48.256. Allantois, probably of a Ruminant. Hunterian. RR. 342. A small sac of semi-transparent white membrane, with a pedicle below and two somewhat puckered corners above; apparently another example of the above. Uninjected. Described in the old catalogue as "apparently a portion of the amnion from a quadruped," a description clearly not written by the person who- made the specimen. See under No. 48. 242.

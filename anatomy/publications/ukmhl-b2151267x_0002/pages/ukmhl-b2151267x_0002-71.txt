LYMPHATIC FOLLICLES OF THE INTESTINE. 453 number of nodules or follicles of round celled tissue identical with the cell masses in a lymphatic gland. They are sometimes also called " closed follicles " or " Peyer's patches." They appear much less vascular than the villi. 35. 34. The Agminated Lymphatic Follicles. Hunterian. P. 37a. Another portion of the same, showing several large Peyer's patches. 35.35. The Agminated Lymphatic Follicles. Peyer's Patches. Himterimi. P. 39. A portion of the ileum, showing a Pej^er's patch about 13 cm. long by 5 mm. broad, running in a straight line down the middle of the free side of the bowel {i.e. opposite the insertion of the mesen- tery) containing a great number of lymphatic follicles. 35.36. The Agminated Lymphatic Follicles of the Intes- tine. Hunterian. P. 40. Another portion of the ileum, slit open along the mesenteric attachment, showing two large patches of follicles in the usual position, i.e. at the free side of the bowel opposite the insertion of the mesentery. These patches are found chiefly in the ileum; in the jejunum and great intestine the follicles mostly occur singly. 35.37. The Agminated Lymphatic Follicles of the Ileum. Hunterian. P. 41. A portion of ileum inverted, finely injected red, showing the above. 35.38. The Agminated Lymphatic Follicles of the Ileum. Hunterian. P. 41a. This and the six following are pieces of ileum showing lymphatic patches of various shapes and sizes. The injection, which is very fine, was formerly red, but has now to a very large extent

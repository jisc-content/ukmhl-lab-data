934 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. SECTION V. Calculi composed principally of Magnesium-Ammonium (Triple) Phosphate. Five calculi have been placed under this heading. They are not absolutely pure triple phosphate; all contain a trace of the earthy phosphate, and one of them a considerable amount of some carbonate. Two of them are from the lower animals, the history of the other three is unknown. *53.165. Triple Phosphate Calculus. From the Bladder of a Hog. Uunterian. A calculus of flattened spherical form, 3"9 cm. in its largest diameter. There is a note in Hunter's handwriting as follows : " This calculus was given to me by Mr. Girl, Surgeon. It was found in the bladder of a hog. The surface was made of small crystallizations, whicli when first taken out were transparent and bright like crystal, in which state Mr. Girl had seen it, but by careless preservation it became opaque and white." It is composed throughout of nearly pure triple phosphates in long radiating crystals fairly compactly agglutinated together. [Hunterian Plate XX., fig. -1.) 53.166. Triple Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus almost identical with the preceding in size, shape, and composition. 53.167. Triple Phosphate and Carbonate Calculus. A si^herical stone about the size of a marble, uncut, similar in appearance to the preceding. " Found in a hog's bladder. Pre- sented by Thomas Kennedy. 7th Dec, 1815." Consists princiijally of triple phosphates, but is readily fusible as if it contained a certain amount of the earthy phosphates. Also effervesces somewhat with hydrochloric acid from the presence of some carbonate, probably of calcium.

The Tongue with the Epiglottis and Hyoid Bone. Hunterian. GO. 23. Showing its anterior jjortion covered with papillae, which are of two kinds—fine pointed filiform, and less numerous, broad round- topped fungiform papillae. The posterior portion is devoid of papillae, but is studded with nodules having on their tops round orifices leading into crypts, which are lined with masses of adenoid tissue like that of the tonsils and receive the ducts of mucous glands. The boundary between these two areas is marked by a V, with the apex directed backwards, composed of nine circumvallate papillae. These are much larger than the other two forms, are surrounded by a trench into which open mucous glands, and on their sides are situated the taste buds. 31.2. The Tongue with the Epiglottis and Hyoid Bone. The Foramen Caecum. Hunterian. GG. 24. Similar to the preceding.

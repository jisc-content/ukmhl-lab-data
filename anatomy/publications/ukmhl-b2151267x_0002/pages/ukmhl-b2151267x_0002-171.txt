553 THE TESTICLE. â€”internally, and passes up the back of the cord, with the blood vessels and nerves in a thick bundle in front of it. 42.30. The Epididymis and Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 13. A testicle with the vas deferens and epididymis injected with mercury and dissected from it and partly unravelled. The epididy- mis appears as a single greatly convoluted tube. 42.31. The Blood-vessels of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 3. A testicle and spermatic cord injected, the arteries red, the veins yellow, and the vas deferens with mercury. Carefully dissected, dried, and mounted in turpentine. The mass of the injections seems to have dissolved to a very great extent, but the colours in part remain. The spermatic artery is seen as a translucent red vessel amid a great plexus of veins, which are translucent or yellow, and there is a second smaller arterial twig near it. The vas deferens is also surrounded by a plexus of veins amid which runs the artery of the cord. The veins are very large and tortuous. A beautiful preparation. 42.32. The Blood-vessels of the Testicle. Hmterian. Y. 5a. A testicle with the arteries and also, apparently, the veins injected red, and the tunica vaginalis spread out. It is dried and mounted in turpentine, showing numerous vessels ramifying on the epididymis and tunica vaginalis. 42.33. The Veins of the Testicle. Eimterian. Y. 20 A testicle with the veins injected green. Showing the great size and tortuosity which characterizes them in this part; they are called the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic cord. 42.34. The Fibrous Framework of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 18. A testicle finely injected red and almost divided transversely, showing the above, and the vascularity of the organ. The

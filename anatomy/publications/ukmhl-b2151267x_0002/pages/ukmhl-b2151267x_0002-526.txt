908 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 53.52. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of an oval calculus of uric acid, with a considerable amount of calcium oxalate intermixed, deposited—partly in granules, partly in fine laminae—round a nucleus of uric acid with some urate of ammonium in the very centre. *53.53. Uric Acid Calculi. Two in the Same Bladder. Hunterian. Two calculi consisting of uric acid with traces of oxalate of lime. The one—about the size of a hen's egg—is of the usual flattened oval shape ; the other—rather smaller than a pigeon's egg—is of a sort of blunt boat shape, with one surface concave. This concave surface fitted on to one end of the large stone. They form the subject of figs. 1 and 2 of Hunterian Plate XII., which show their relative positions—fig. 1 showing the outer surfaces, fig. 2 the cut surfaces. The external surfaces partly smooth, partly tuberculated. 53.54. Uric Acid Calculus. " Hunterian. A stone verj' like the small one in the preceding specimen, and which doubtless owed its shape to having been associated with another stone in similar manner. Its fellow could not be identified. Uric acid with trace of calcium oxalate. 53.55. Uric Acid Calculi. Two in One Bladder. Hunterian. Two calculi, cut; probably from the same case. Mounted together in a small show case. The one is a flattened oval stone about the size of a pigeon's egg; the other is about the size of a goose's egg, in shape somewhat flattened, and in profile of the broadest surface oval, with a deep bay in either side, which corresponds in size with the small stone. Probably the small stone lay sometimes on the one side of the large, sometimes on the other. They are of the same composition—uric acid with a trace of calcium oxalate. The exterior of the large one is tuberculated. Not having been varnished, they are rather rotten and crumbling.

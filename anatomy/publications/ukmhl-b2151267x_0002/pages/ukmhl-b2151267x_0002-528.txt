910 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. consists largely of triple phosphates, but mixed with a certain amount of the earthy phosphates. Its weight was " 1 lb. 12| oz. avoirdupois." 53.59. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. An irregularly oval stone about the size of a hen's egg, consisting of a uric acid and oxalate of lime (mixed) stone surrounded by a shell, from -5 to 1 cm. thick, of mixed phosphates. 53.60. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Huntenan. A small stone of flattened spherical shape, consisting of uric acid with a thin shell of unusually dense mixed phosphates. Between the uric acid and the phosphates is a distinct line, of paler brown colour, which is largely urate of ammonium. 53. 61. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A large uric acid stone with a calcium oxalate stone about the size of a hazel nut for nucleus and a thin external shell of mixed phosphates. 53.62. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Eunierian. Half of a similar but smaller stone, the nucleus uric acid and the layer of phosphates very thin. Also a good deal of calcium oxalate in a layer in which the uric acid is of the granular form. *53.63. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Eunierian, A stone about the size of a pigeon's egg. The cut surface shows a small flattened oval calculus, of uric acid mixed with a good deal of calcium oxalate, placed at one side, then a wide crescentic mass of fusible phosphates building it up to a circular outline, and then a narrow ring of uric acid and oxalate forming a complete shell round the other two parts; and outside that, over about half of the stone, on the same side as the enclosed mass of phosphates, another layer of mixed phosphates of crescentic shape in section. {Eunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 6.)

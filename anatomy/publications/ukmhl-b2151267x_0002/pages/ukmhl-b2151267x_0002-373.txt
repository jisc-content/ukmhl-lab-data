COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE PLACENTA. 755 hangs the placenta by a cord 11 cm. long, which is twisted like the human. The placenta is preserved inside the portion of uterus to which it Avas attached. It forms a thick mass packed into a corner of the uterus, of circular shape, and very distinctly lobulated. The cord is inserted at one side, and its vessels ramify over the lobules. In shape, therefore, it is intermediate between the cotyledonary and the discoidal. Being intact, no further details of its structure are visible.

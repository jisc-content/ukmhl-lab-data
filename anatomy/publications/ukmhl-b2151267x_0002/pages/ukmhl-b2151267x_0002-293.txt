THE BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE GRAVID UTERUS. 675 48.34. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. Hunterian. EE. 23. "A portion of another uterus, highly injected red." Shows very strikingly the thick part of the uterine wall honeycombed with vessels, where the placenta was attached; also the oblique orifices of the veins, where they were torn across in the removal of that organ. Compare Structure of the Placenta, Nos. 48.83 et seq. 48.35. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. Hunterian. EE. 25. A similar part of another uterus, "the arteries injected red, the veins yellow." The yellow has dissolved, and the veins are now empty. This specimen shows part of the area of attachment of the placenta, which is recognizable by the widely open mouths of the torn uterine veins. 48.36. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. Hunterian. EE. 26. Another portion of the same. 48.37. The Vascularity of the Gravid Uterus. Hunteiian. EE. 26a. " Portion of the gravid uterus, with the ovarium and Fallopian tube, highly injected red; surface of uterus partly covered by decidua, which is likewise seen injected from the vessels of the uterus. (Not described nor numbered.)" 48.38. The Blood-vessels of the Gravid Uterus. The Placental Arteries and Veins. Hunterian. EE. 27. " An inverted gravid uterus at the ninth month, arteries injected red, the veins yellow; there are large venal orifices on the inside surface, which were torn through in separating the placenta; the arteries nowhere form villi, but pretty coarse branches which are also seen torn through, by the sides of the torn veins; the whole exceedingly vascular." The orifices of some of the torn veins are filled by plugs of blood-clot; others are seen wide open, passing in very oblique directions into the muscular wall of the organ. The

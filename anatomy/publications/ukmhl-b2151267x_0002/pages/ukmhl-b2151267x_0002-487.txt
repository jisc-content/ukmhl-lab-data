869 GALL STONES. 52.43. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. Two dark brown calculi about the size of hazel nuts—one broken— showing the centre a laminated cholesterine gall stone, with a good deal of brown pigment matter in it, enclosed in a thin shell of nearly pure bilirubin calcium. Calculi for the most part of small size, of dark colour, rich reddish brown, dark greenish brown, or black; consisting almost entirely of bilirubin calcium with traces of other bile pigments, and mucus. Before the blowpipe a fragment of them swells up into a black charred mass, catches fire, and burns with white flame, and the black organic matter burns away, leaving a little white ash of carbonate of lime, insoluble in water, but effervescing with hydrochloric acid. 52.44. Bilirubin Calcium Gall Stone. Hunterian. An oval not faceted calculus, measuring 2 by 1'3 by 1 cm., of dark, almost black colour, formed in concentric laminae. " From Mr. Smart, taken from a woman about 50, with a diseased pancreas and uterus, without any gall stone symptoms." Sinks like a stone in water. 52.45. Bilirubin Calcium Gall Stone. Hunterian. A similar slightly larger calculus, of dull reddish brown colour and more loosely laminated. Just floats in water. 52.46. Bilirubin Calcium Gall Stone. Hunterian. A small calculus, rough and tuberculated like a mulberry calculus, broken on one side; externally drab colour, internally black. Sinks in water. Two black oval calculi; their surfaces are in part covered with a thin layer of inorganic matter of whitish colour. Sink in water. (D) BILE PIGMENT GALL STONES. 52.47. Bilirubin Calcium Gall Stone.

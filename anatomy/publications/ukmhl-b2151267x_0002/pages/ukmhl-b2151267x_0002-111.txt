493 TUMOURS OF THE INTESTINES. 36.99. Acute Peritonitis with Miliary Subperitoneal Tubercles. Hunterian. P. 86c. Another coil of intestine from the same case as the preceding, showing the same glueing together and miliary tubercles. Figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Ease. IV., PI. I., fig. 3, as an illustration of the " eflects of inflammation upon the outer surface of the intestines." V. Tumours of the Intestines. (a) Innocent Tumours. 36.100. Submucous Lipoma of the Duodenum. Hunterian. P. 64. "The duodenum of a woman from the dissecting room, slit open to show a tumour the size of a cherry, opposite to the orifice of the gall duct. It contained a fluid, but what symptoms it produced in the body when alive are not known." It is oval, pedunculated, encapsuled, and covered with mucous membrane. It is very soft, and the surface of the section was covered with a layer of white debris, like adipocere. Microscopic structure that of a lipoma. To the naked eye, the place from which a portion was taken for micro- scopic examination, shows the loose texture of adipose tissue. Most of the fat seems to have dissolved out. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 67.) 36.101. Adenoma of the Ileum. Hunterian. P. 65. A tumour, "not larger than an acorn, arising from the inner surface of the intestine, at the lower end of the ileum, and which was not complained of." ("Mr. Hume, Surgeon.") It is round, sessile, but with a considerably constricted base. A section shows it to be covered by mucous membrane with the usual lieberkuhnian glands, villi, and lymphatic follicles, and muscularis mucosae. The tumour tissue consists of sections of tubes lined with tall columnar epithelium, closely copying the glands. At one part the glands, and the glandular tubules of the tumour seem to be continuous through the muscularis mucosae. The appearances, both micro- scopical and naked eye, show conclusively that it is adenoma, not carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 64.)

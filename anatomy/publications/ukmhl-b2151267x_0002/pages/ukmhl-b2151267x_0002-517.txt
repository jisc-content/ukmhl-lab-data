899 URIC ACID CALCULI 53.2. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus about the same size as the preceding, cut. Both halves have also been broken across, and one portion lost. It has the following history: "A man cut by Mr. Lambert, Apr. 10, 1778. He had been cut by do., Feb. 1, 1777, and a few days after passed a small stone from the kidney and wound. A few days after his cure passed a stone from his kidney into his bladder, but never voided it. This no doubt was the very stone, viz., of about 12 months' growth; quite dry; weight, 391 grains. 70 cut; 9 died." 53.3. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of an oval calculus nearly as big as a goose's egg. Pure uric acid, granulated in centre. 53.4. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Portions of a calculus of blunt oval shape, which must have been even larger than the preceding. The centre granular, the rest compact and laminated. 53.5. Uric Acid Calculus. Hmterian. The two halves of a calculus about the size of a duck's egg, of long oval shape, composed entirely of finely laminated uric acid. Exter- nally smooth. 53.6. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus, cut, rather smaller than the preceding, composed of pale brown uric acid in very fine dense laminae. It has split radially into several fragments, some of which show a tendency to further radial splitting. 53.7. Uric Acid Calculus. Hmterian. Half of a concretion about the size of a duck's egg, of oval shape, Avith broad ends. It is very hard and heavy. The centre and a broad outer layer are formed of fine laminae of various shades of brown; the stratum between is granulated, but very compact. Its exterior is finely tuberculated, like an oxalate of lime calculus, but it is composed throughout of practically pure uric acid.

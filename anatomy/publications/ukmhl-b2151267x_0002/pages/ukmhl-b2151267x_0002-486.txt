868 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. *52.36. Common Gall Stones. Ewnterian. Two large gall stones similar to the preceding in composition and structure, divided longitudinally (half of the smaller absent). They fit into one another by a facet on their wide ends, and together they form a long oval mass, 6 by 2-8 cm., which filled the whole gall- bladder. (Extra Hunterian Plate, figs. 7 and la.) 52.37. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. The two halves of a very similar stone of much smaller size. Crystalline part, 1'2 cm.; bilirubin calcium part, 3 mm. Sinks in water. 52.38. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. A similar stone, uncut. Floats in water. 52.39. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. Half of a similar stone which shows the peculiarity of a very thin shell of translucent pearly cholesterine outside the bilirubin calcium layers, varying in thickness and giving it a mottled appearance, from a pearly caf6 au lait to deep chestnut brown colour. 52.40. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. Half of a small calculus consisting of a small centre of pure crystalline cholesterine, with a thin shell of bilirubin calcium. Sinks in water. 52.41. Common Gall Stones. Hunterian. Portions of two similar calculi, broken. Sink in water. *52.42. Common Gall Stone. Hunterian. Half of a calculus, consisting of a fairly pure crystalline choles- terine gall stone, surrounded by a thick layer of very pure laminated bilirubin calcium of deep brown colour. This layer has crumbled away to a considerable extent, apparently through the ravages of mites. Floats in water. {Extra Hunterian Plate, fig. 5.)

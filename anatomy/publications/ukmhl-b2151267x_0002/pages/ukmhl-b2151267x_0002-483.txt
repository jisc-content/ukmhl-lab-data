865 GALL STONES. 52.24. Laminated Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. A boxful of similar stones of very various sizes, faceted, but rather rough on the outside. Finely laminated. Sink in water. 52.25. Laminated Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. Four faceted stones in appearance very like No. 52.23, but in section showing less of the dense laminated matter, and a relatively large centre of loose textured crystalline cholesterine and bilirubin calcium. Just float in water. 52.26. Laminated Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. A boxful of similar small calculi. Yellow and polished on the outside. Float in water. 52.27. Laminated Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. Two similar calculi, but of considerable size, measuring fully 2"5 cm. in diameter. Very decidedly faceted and smooth, but for the most part not polished. Float in water. 52.28. Laminated Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. Three calculi of deep brown colour and glossy like a chestnut, one of them broken showing the internal structure. Float in water. 52.29. Mixed Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. Several faceted calculi, broken to show structure, consisting almost entirely of cholesterine which is throughout of a very brown colour from the presence of bile pigment matter. One or two are hollow with the points of the crystalline cholesterine pointing into the centre; the others have a centre of loose bilirubin calcium. The outer parts are laminated. Float in water. 52.30. Mixed Cholesterine Gall Stones. Hunterian. A number of small irregular brown calculi, consisting of choles- terine crystals mixed with a large amount of bilirubin calcium. Float in water.

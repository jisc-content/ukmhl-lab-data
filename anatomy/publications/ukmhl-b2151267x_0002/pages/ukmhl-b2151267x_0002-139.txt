SERIES 40. ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER. The Shape and Structure of the Kidney, . . . 1-26 The Blood-vessels of the Kidney, .... 27-40 The Comparative Anatomy of the Kidney, . . . 41-61 40.1. The Right Kidney, Pelvis of Kidney, and Ureter. Hunterian. X. 1. "The right human kidney; the ureter and pelvis distended with injection, and one side of the kidney after this removed. It shows the shape of the kidney, the thickness of its flesh, and that it is hollow within." The hollow is the hilum, by which the blood-vessels enter and the ureter passes out. The pelvis of the kidney and its branches, the calyces—the collecting receptacle into which the secretion is poured by the excretory tubes, and from which it is carried off by the ureter—are greatly overdistended. 40.2. The Right Kidney, Pelvis, and Ureter. Hu7iterian. X. 2. Half of a right human kidney, injected red. " The ureter and pelvis were injected with spirits till it became hard, and then one side was removed." The pelvis is opened to show its cavity— an irregular space, with branches called "calyces" projecting from it, and embracing the pyramids. Compare succeeding specimens. 40.3. The Medullary Pyramids of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 3, A kidney divided transversely to show the breadth of its cavity,

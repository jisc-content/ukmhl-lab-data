648 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. fungating tumour. On the deep surface the tumour is seen in section. Microscopically it is found to be a highly cellular carcinoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 102.) 45.117. Carcinoma of the Mamma. Presented hij Dr. J. W. Wallace, 1898. Section of a mamma through the nipple. The tumour appears as a whitish mass amid the yellow fat of the mamma. It occupies the whole of what has been the gland proper, and seems to have contracted the organ considerably; compare normal mammae Nos. 44.45 and 44.46. It extends vertically from the nipple (which is somewhat retracted) 3 cm., and in breadth 6 cm. Outrunners from it have invaded the underlying pectoral muscle, and the axillary glands were infected. It is a carcinoma of the scirrhus type, like the succeeding specimen. (West of Scotland Clin. Res. Lab., No. 2/61.) 45.118. Carcinoma of the Mamma. Presented by Dr. J. W. Wallace, 1898. Section of a rather smaller mamma through the nipple. The tumour extends from below the nipple principally towards one sideâ€”towards the axilla. A deep cicatrix dips down into the tumour near its edge; at the bottom of this cicatrix, and around the nipple, the surface of the growth is ulcerated. The nipple is considerably retracted by shrinking of the older parts of the growth. In microscopic structure it is a carcinoma of the scirrhus type, consisting at the growing edge of small solid processes of epithelial cells infiltrating the neighbouring muscle, fat, or skin; in the older parts these processes have largely disappeared, and only a dense fibrous tissue like that of an old cicatrix remains.

CALCULI OF URIC ACID AND PHOSPHATES. 909 (c) Calculi consisting of Uric Acid and Phosphates. The specimens included under this title are calculi which are primarily uric acid stones belonging to one or other of the pre- ceding species, but showing a layer or layers of phosphates of the normal alkaline earths, viz,, phosphates of calcium, magnesium, and of magnesium and ammonium (triple phosphate) mixed in varying proportions, constituting the fusible calculus. The phos- phates as a rule form the external shell of the stone. In one or two they are mixed with the uric acid. In one there is a layer of uric acid outside the phosphates. In most the phosphates show a trace of urate of ammonium. The exterior is always rough. Compare Section IV., Phosphatic Calculi. 53.56. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus consisting of a uric acid stone about the size of a pigeon's egg, with a nucleus of oxalate of lime about the size of a pea, and outer shell of fusible mixed phosphates. The phosphates are of dirty white colour, and loose and friable. 53.57. Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hnnterian. A smaller calculus similar to the preceding. The exterior is imusually smooth. There is a good deal of phosphates mixed through the uric acid stone. The nucleus is a small urate of ammonium calculus. 53.58. Very Large Uric Acid and Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. An enormous calculus "from a man"; doubtless removed post- mortem. It is of irregularly oval shape, and measures 14 by 8-3 bj' 7-5 cm. (5i by 2>\ by 3 inches)â€”considerably larger than an emu's egg. Its exterior is of fusible phosphates, which appear to constitute only a thin shell; at one side this is imperfect, and there appears a uric acid calculus which probablj' constitutes the main mass. It has been broken and pieced together again with plaster of Paris. Some of the phosphatic shell has a distinctly crystalline appearance, like the exterior of the triple phosphate intestinal concretions, and it

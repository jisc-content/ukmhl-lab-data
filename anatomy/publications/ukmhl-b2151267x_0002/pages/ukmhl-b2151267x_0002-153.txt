RENAL CALCULUS. 535 numbers of little yellow stones, small as pin-heads, formed about the points of the mamillae ; they were probably passing off by the urine, but might lay the basis of large stone in the bladder." Only a few are visible. They are quite rotten and disintegrating. They consist of uric acid and crystals of calcium oxalate mixed with blood. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.11. Renal Calculus. Hnnterian. X. 97a. A portion of kidney showing a small dark brown stone embedded in one of the calyces of the pelvis. It is breaking down. A fragment of it was found to be uric acid. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.12. Renal Calculus Impacted in the Ureter. Atrophy of the Kidney Tissue. Hunterian. X. 98. A kidney slit open from its convex edge, showing a small nodulated calculus impacted in the ureter. The pyramids have atrophied and disappeared, and a condition of hydronephrosis has been established at their expense. Compare succeeding speci- mens. There is also a smaller calculus in one of the calyces, where it is kept by a stitch. They are composed of calcium oxalate â€”"mulberry" calculi. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.13. Renal Calculus. Atrophy of Kidney Tissue. Hydro- nephrosis. Hunterian. X. 99. One half of a kidney showing a black stone of considerable size, partly filling the pelvis, and blocking the ureter. As in the pre- ceding, the pyramids have atrophied, and the pelvis and its calyces have dilated considerably. There are several smaller stones in the calyces at the lower end. It is a mixed calcium oxalate and uric acid calculus. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.14. Renal Calculus Impacted in the Ureter. .Hydro- nephrosis. Hunterian. X. 105. A kidney with the pelvis opened, showing a large stone impacted in the ureter. It also fills up the lower part of the pelvis, moulded accurately to its shape. Its base is hollowed out as if accretion

A placenta uninjected, unravelled by maceration and washing, as described under No. 48.123, showing the above. The foetal portion of the placenta does not consist solely of foetal vessels, as described under No. 48,123, but of hypertrophied chorionic villi with the blood-vessels inside them (see No. 48.134a.) Compare No. 48.158 et seq., Development of the Placenta, etc.; and Com- parative Anatomy of the Placenta, No. 48.229 et seq. 48.128. Placenta Unravelled. Foetal Portion. Hunterian.

The early stages of development must be studied in the series of embryological wax models, No. 51. It is hoped in the future to fill the gaps in the series with new specimens. 46.1. The Ovary and Oviducts of a Breeding Hen. Hunterian. The back part of a hen, skinned, and with all the anterior parietes and digestive organs removed, showing the ovary, which consists of a cluster of eggs in various stages of ripeness enclosed in their capsules. Four of them are far advanced; the largest about the size of the mature yolk of an egg. The long twisted oviduct and the cloaca are partly laid open; the orifice of the latter is kept open by a bougie. 46.2. The Ovary and Oviducts of a Breeding Bird (Hen ?). Hunterian. Similar to the preceding, injected red. The oviduct being un- opened is more distinct. 46.3. The Blastoderm "at 36 Hours." Hunterian. NN. 14.

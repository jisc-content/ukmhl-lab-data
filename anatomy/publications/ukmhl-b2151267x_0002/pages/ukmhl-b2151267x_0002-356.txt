788 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48.203. Embryo and Membranes about the Eighth Week. Hunterian. (Not numbered but apparently Hunterian.) The embryo is slightly larger and better formed than the preceding. Arm and forearm, thigh and leg, and the digits in the fore limbs are distinct. These last are faintly indicated in the hind limbs. The neck has been torn across. The thoracic wall is very thin, but there is no appearance of the branchial clefts remaining. The mass of mem- branes and decidua is several times as large as the embryo, which measures about 2 cm. in length; its head is nearly as large as its body. 48.204. Embryo and Membranes about the end of the Second Month. Hunterian. RE. 230. An embryo slightly larger than the preceding (2^ cm. long), and better shaped. The eyes are on the front of the head; the mouth is small, and there are rudiments of a nose, and external ears. The anterior wall of the thorax is opaque and strong. The mass of the membranes very large in proportion to the foetus. 48.205. Embryo early in the Third Month. Hunterian. EE. 226. It is about 3'5 cm. long. The limbs are well formed. A mass of intestines protrudes from the umbilicus. The feet inter- fere with the view of the external genitals; these consist of two folds with a cleft between them, and the rudimentary penis or clitoris projecting about 1 mm., covered, as with a hood, by the anterior parts of the folds ; the condition hardly allows a definite statement as to the sex of the embryo; compare Series 51, Embryological AVax Models. 48.206. Embryo in the Third Month. Ossification. Hunterian. EE. 297. An embryo very similar to specimen No. 57 in Series 1, Development of Bone, but less transparent and therefore showing the centres of ossification less plainly. It is very thin, and the double ridge of laminar processes of the vertebral column can be clearly seen, showing that the osseous canal is still open in its whole

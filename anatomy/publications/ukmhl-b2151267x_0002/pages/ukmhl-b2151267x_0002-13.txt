Not the whole set is here, so that many of the illustrations could not be identified with any specimen; but several were readily identified with their originals, and others correspond more or less accurately to specimens, though they could not with certainty be said to be representations of them. The references in the descriptions are to the volume of plates in Palmer's edition of John Hunter's works. 29.1. The Mouth of a Child. Hunterian. GG. 20.

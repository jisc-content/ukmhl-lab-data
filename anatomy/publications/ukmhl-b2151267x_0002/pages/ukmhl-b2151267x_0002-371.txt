COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE PLACENTA. 753 48.265. Foetal Dog and Zonary Placenta. Hunterian. ER. 336. A similar specimen, the placenta very finely injected "from the mother." No injection in the foetal vessels. The amnion, described in the former catalogue as " entire," is now very much torn and reflected from the foetus. 48.266. Zonary Placenta and Chorion of Dog. Inverted. Hunterian. HE. 337. "The veins are injected, and they may be seen beautifully ramifying on the chorion"â€”on the non-placental as well as the placental area. 48.267. Uterus, Placenta, and Membranes of Dog. Hunterian. EE. 338. " A portion of uterus, placenta, and membranes; the internal surface of uterus is seen very vascular; the placenta is irregularly furrowed where it is in contact with the uterus; the decidua may be seen resting partly on the uterus, and partly on the placenta; placenta is injected partly from the womb, and partly by the navel-string; the navel-string injected red and white." The red is now a dark lake, which is probably in consequences of changes in the pigment such as are seen in a number of specimens in the intestine series. The uterine vessels are full of a similar dark colouring matter. At the edges of the placenta appear a number of distinct floating chorionic villi, with a few vessels in them filled with the dark injection from the umbilical cord. 48.268. Zonary Deciduate Placenta of Cat. Hunterian. C. la. The placenta and membranes of a kitten, inverted, injected red by the maternal vessels and white and black by the foetal artery and vein respectively. The placenta on its outer surface is very finely lobulated. It is to a very considerable degree injected red, showing that a large part of it is deciduous maternal tissue. The remains of the amnion are also preserved. This specimen was formerly classified in Series C, Veins, and described as follows

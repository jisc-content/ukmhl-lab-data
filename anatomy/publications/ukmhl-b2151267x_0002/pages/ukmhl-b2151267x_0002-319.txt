THE AMNION, CHORION, AND DECIDUA. 701 opaque porous membrane, distinguishable from everj' other mem- brane of the body, and resembling somewhat a fine lace." A portion of this is figured in Plate XXIX. of William Hunter's plates of the Gi-avid Uterus, "considerably magnified," representing "the internal surface of a portion of the decidua, to show its peculiar cribriform or lace-like appearance." This is due to the presence in it of innumerable dilated uterine glands, which being torn across, ajjpear as cup-like depressions in the surface of the layer of decidua which is here shown lining the interior of the uterus. It is also through this zone of dilated uterine glands that the normal separation of the decidua in parturition takes place, leaving the deeper stratum adhering to the uterus. 48.113a. Section of Decidua in the Eighth Week, with Photomicrograph. J.H.T. 1897. Microscopic section of the decidua vera from an abortion in the eighth week, No. 48.177ft. Showing its thickness at this early period, and the dilated uterine glands described in the preceding specimen. Stained with haematoxylin, and mounted in Canada balsam. The photograph shows the relation of parts. The dilated glands occupy the deeper layers of the separated decidua giving it a spongy character, whereas the superficial layer is comparatively dense tissue. 48.114. Amnion, Chorion, and Decidua. Huntcrian. RR. 135. A section of the uterus, with the above partly detached and hanging down. The decidua is fairly thin, showing that it was at a late period of its existence. 48.115. Amnion, Chorion, and Decidua. Hunterian. RB. 136. Similar to the preceding. 48.116. Amnion, Chorion, and Decidua. Hunterian. RR. 137. A similar preparation, the decidua injected red and split into two layers; the superficial contains fewer vessels than the deep one

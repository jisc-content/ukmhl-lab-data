ABORTIONS. 775 49.64. An Abortion containing a Malformed Embryo. Hunterian. BR. 263. Similar to the preceding. Not so old, the chorionic villi well marked and the membranes generally not so indurated. 49.65. Abortions long retained in the Uterus. Hunterian. BR. 264. "Two miscarriages about the sixth month." If the history given in the old catalogue can be relied on, these two products of conception must have been retained in utero fully four months after the death of the embryos, which are certainly not of more than eight weeks' growth. Both malformed. 49.66. An Abortion long retained in the Uterus. Hunterian. BB. 269. "A miscarriage about seven weeks"; this undoubtedly refers to the probable age of the embryo. Numbers of chorionic villi are recognizable in the thickened membranes. The embryo is malformed. 49.67. A Miscarriage in the Seventh Month. Foetus Dead Two or Three Months. Presented hij Dr. Service of Dennistoun, 1897. A miscarriage about the size of a foetal head at term. The history of the case as received from Dr. Service is as follows: "Last menstruation, June, 1896. Abortion occurred, January 21, 1897. Dead in utero probably three months." The membranes present a fairly healthy appearance. The decidua is moderately thick and fleshy, and presents the usual cribriform appearance. There is no trace of separation of it into two layers, the vera and reflexa having evidently coalesced. The placenta is firm and fleshy; about 1 cm. thick. The membranes are torn at one end of the oval conception, but the foetus is inside. It measures 10 cm. from head to buttocks. It is slightly macerated, the skin being loose and peeling in places. Probably it died in the early part of the fifth month. Microscopic examination of the placenta shows a decadent but not necrosed structure. The epithelial layers of the amnion and chorion are fairly well pre-

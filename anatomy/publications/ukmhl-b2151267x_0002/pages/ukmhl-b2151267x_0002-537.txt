CALCIUM OXALATE CALCULI. 919 53.95. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Eunterian. A spherical stone about the size of a pigeon's egg, uncut, very rough with fine tubercles. 53.96. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian, A small very rough mulberry calculus with its prongs buried in a thick layer of fibrinous material. The prongs were doubtless pretty thoroughly concealed and protected by this layer when it was fresh and wet. 53.97. Calcium Oxalate Calculus. Hunterian. Five stones of various shapes about the size of peas, of dirty white colour, and very smooth and polished externally. The largest is broken. It consists of a centre of brown matter like old blood clot, and a shell, about 2 ram. thick, of pure calcium oxalate in very fine laminae. It is very hard. A fragment decrepitates before the blow- pipe, but the powder swells up to a grey ash which effervesces with hydrochloric acid. The calculus gives no murexide reaction ; it is soluble without effervescence in cold hydrochloric acid, but insoluble in acetic acid; gives no evolution of ammonia on moistening the powder with caustic potash. It is calcium oxalate, decrepitating probably from the presence of a good deal of organic matter in it. (6) Calculi of Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid or Urates. ^53.98. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian.. A calculus of irregular oblong shape with four stout prominences, from its appearance a kidney stone. Two of the prominences were formerly capped with small calculi; the facets on which they rested are highlj^ polished. It consists of a central oxalate stone, then several layers of uric acid and oxalate mixed, and a thin outer shell of nearly pure oxalate. {Hunterian Plate IX., fig. 3.)

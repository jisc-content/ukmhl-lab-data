EMBRYOLOGY. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHICK. 847 now developed into two vesicles which are rising up above the primitive fore brain. The hind brain shows the flattening and broadening corresponding to the fourth ventricle on the top of the pons Varolii, and the prominence at the front of it, which becomes the cerebellum. 51.17. Development of the Heart and Intestines in the Chick. (After His.) From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. Models 18-23. (a) Heart from the 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Stages. Model 18. Heart from Fifth Stage, No. 3. Junction of the two folds of splanchnopleure and formation of a single tubular heart from the two primitive blood-vessels. Model 19. Heart from Seventh Stage, No. 6. Curvature of the simple tubular heart to the right. At the lower (caudal) end are seen the two vitelline (omphalo-meseraic) veins, coming in from the area vasculosa. Model 20. Heart from Eighth Stage, No. 10. Heart quite doubled on itself, first trace of the auricles, and definition of the bulbus anteriosus from the ventricular portion of the tube. The auricles have now advanced to a level with the cephalic end (afterwards the base) of the heart. Model 21. Heart from Ninth Stage, No. 12. Shape of the adult heart, is beginning to be appreciable ; auricles quite distinct; four pairs of aortic arches rising from the bulbus arteriosus. Compare No. 51.23. (b) Development of the Intestines from the 8th and 9th Stages. Model 22. Intestines from the Eighth Stage, No. 10. The fore end is blind; there are indications of two visceral clefts and three visceral folds; the greater part of the intestine is open, and the tail fold just commencing to enclose the hind gut. Model 23. Intestine from the Ninth Stage, No. 12. Connection with the mouth is established; there are four visceral clefts, which are not open to the intestine ; further development of the splanchnopleuric folds enclosing the intestine; in the region which

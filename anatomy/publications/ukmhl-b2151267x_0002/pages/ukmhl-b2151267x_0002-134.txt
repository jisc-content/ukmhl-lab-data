516 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 39.17. The Wall of a Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 48. A portion of the fibrous capsule of the cyst, with the gall bladder, laid open, adhering to its outside. Also a portion of the hydatid. The chitinous capsule is about 1 mm. thick, and quite opaque. It is curled at its edges, but held out by glass rods, showing the inner surface covered with shreds of thin transparent chitinous cuticle, like shreds of mica. Apparently part of a very large old cyst, to judge by the dense fibrous appearance and thinness of the capsule and the thickness of the chitinous ectocyst. 39.18. Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 65. The chitinous ectocyst of a hydatid of considerable size. The laminated chitinous material was readily recognizable with the microscope. It is of varying thickness and opacity. There are numerous white spots in it, which are not heads. Neither echino- coccus heads nor booklets could be found in the specimen. 39.19. Hydatid of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 64. The fibrous capsule laid open, and mounted in turpentine. 39.20. Hydatids from the Liver. Hwnterian. U. 39. Three hydatids more or less collapsed. 39.21. Daughter Cysts of a Hydatid. From the Liver. Hunterian. U. 42a. A jar containing a large number of the above, varying in size from a currant to a gooseberry. Some of the larger ones appear to contain several smaller cysts. 39.22. Hydatid of the Lung. â€” A portion of a lung, with a fibrous walled cavity about the size of a hen's egg in it, and the hydatid which it contained hanging beside it.

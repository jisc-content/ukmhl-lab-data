768 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. embryo and part of the cord have torn away from their attachment and lie on the bottom of the sac. (fZ) Disease of the Umbilical Cord. 49.37. Twisting of the Umbilical Cord. Eunterian. (Not described.) A foetus, 4-2 cm. long, probablj' of about 3 months, with its umbilical cord about 12 cm. long, and twisted into a mere thread. It is hung by the placenta, which seems to be imperfectly developed. This condition has been variously interpreted; either as the cause of the death of the foetus by strangling the circulation, or as resulting from the maternal movements acting on a foetus already dead from other causes. (e) Abortions. Most of the specimens from No. 49.38 to No. 49.48 are abortions which have been shed immediately or only a short time (at most a few days) after the death of the conception, and before they had undergone degenerative changes. With them should be compared the specimens in the preceding series, illus- trating the development of the ovum, Nos. 48.159 to 48.191, which are mostly well-preserved abortions. The history of Nos. 48.168, 48.170, and 48.177a is known. The first and the last were shed within a few hours of a shock, the other was extra- uterine ; all three are fresh healthy-looking conceptions. Nos. 49.49 to 49. 68 illustrate the conditions found in abortions which have been retained for from some weeks up to several months in utero and have undergone various changes, mostly of the nature of degenerations. 49.38. A very Early Abortion. Third or Fourth Week. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. It consists of the clear chorionic vesicle, about 1 cm. in diameter, covered with villiâ€”sparsely, except at one part which was already indicated as the future site of the placenta. The embryo is not visible. Such a minute object as this might readily pass unnoticed in a discharge of blood from the uterus, and the miscarriage be regarded as only an unusually profuse menstruation.

COLLOID OVARIAN CYSTOMA. 639 Formerly placed in the old series F as an example of "human cellular membrane from a tumour, showing the cells as distended with a morbid gelatinous fluid." The microscope, however, shows that the so-called cells are cysts lined with epithelium originating from glandular tissue, and therefore not at all analogous to the spaces of the areolar tissue to which the name cells was applied by Hunter and his contemporaries. The specimen has accordingly been removed to its proper place among tumours. 45.94. Portion of Colloid Cystoma (Adenoma) of the Ovary, Hunterian. CC. iQa. " Portion of an encysted dropsy of the ovarium, size of an orange, full of a glairy fluid which coagulates in spirits, but was originally transparent." The contents have been removed. Similar to the preceding in nature. 45.95. Portion of Colloid Ovarian Cystoma. Adhesion to Diaphragm. Hunterian. CC. iiib. " A very large portion of the same diseased ovarium; the jelly scooped out; the different cysts, many of them communicating with one another, exposed : on one side is seen a portion of the diaphragm, with a very large ossification in it; also a portion of the lungs, showing that the ovarium had reached so high." It must have been a very large cyst. The adhesion and portion of diaphragm hang down behind. The " ossification " looks like a calcareous plate on the upper surface of the diaphragm, probably connected with old disease of the pleura. 45.96. Bilateral Cystic Transformation of the Ovaries. Uterine Adenomata. Hunterian. CC. 120. (Not described.) Anterior portion of uterus with appendages, showing, on the right, part of a large cyst with thin walls in which are embedded numerous smaller cysts, evidently derived from the right ovary. The left ovary is also cystic; about the size of a walnut. In the cavity of the uterus are a number of small adenomata.

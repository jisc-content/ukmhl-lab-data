See also Nos. 48.33, 48.34, 48.111, 48.112, 48.113, 48.153, 48. 155, 48.156, and 48. 158. 48.44. The Cervix and Os Uteri in the Last Month of Pregnancy. Hunterian. lili. 35. " Os tincae from the gravid uterus at the ninth month." The cervix with a ring of vagina, into which project the greatly hyper- trophied lips of the os. The os itself is a narrow transverse slit about 2 cm. long. The cavity of the uterus has decidedly encroached upon the cervix, though the dilatation of the os externum by labour had clearly not begun." From the thickness and irregularity of the OS it is evidently that of a multipara. Compare No. 48.49. 48.45. The Cervix and Os Uteri in the Last Month of Pregnancy. Hunterian. BE. 36. " Os tincae from the gravid uterus at the ninth month. It projects a little way into vagina; bristles are introduced into the follicles, which secrete the gelatinous fluid which blocks up the cervix: in this and the preceding preparation cervix is seen on the posterior side." The os had begun to dilate. It measures nearly 3 cm. by 5 mm., and its depth is only about 6 mm. The cavity of the cervix is encroached upon still more than in the preceding. It is flattened out from above, and its rugae pennatae are seen looking up towards the general cavity of the uterus; they are so distinct that the subject was probably a primipara.

A portion of the OS tincae, cervix uteri, and vagina slit open and laid out flat. The cervix is not shortened, but appears to have been opening out in its upper part. The muscular wall is greatly hypertrophied. The mucous membrane is thickened and honeycombed with the glandular

762 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 49.7. Extrauterine Foetus from the preceding. Hunteriaji. RE. 370. " The foetus belonging to the last number ; very much defaced and compressed." Its size shows that a very considerable portion of the sac has been cut away. It was probably in the fifth month. The conception in its sac had probably risen out of the true pelvis into the abdomen dragging the uterus up with it. 49.8. An Extrauterine Foetus. Hunterian. RR. 378. " An extrauterine foetus, very much deformed: the face scarce^ or rather not at all, distinguishable; the upper extremities lost and the two lower jutting out, exactly resembling what are called drumsticks in a fowl." The whole mass is very firm; the soft tissues cut like cartilage; they are quite translucent and not calcified at all. They are of a dead white colour. The scalp is partly dissected, showing the bones. 49.9. Extrauterine Foetus. Hunterian. RR. 379.

The specimen consists of a thick fibrous sac, with the uterus^ vagina, bladder, rectum, and a part of the abdominal wall (apparently the umbilicus) attached to it. The sac is cut in several places showing within it the bones of the foetus almost completely macerated. The sac lies behind and above the uterus, attached to it. The right Fallopian tube is lost at once in its wall^ the left runs some distance upwards and outwards on it before it likewise gets buried in it. The rectum and sigmoid flexure are recognizable adhering to the left side and back of the sac. Bones have ulcerated into them at two places. On the right side of the sac adhere one or two more coils of intestine. The portion of abdominal wall has been perforated by ulceration. In the hole a bone is-

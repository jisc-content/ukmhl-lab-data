HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 424 cysts with mucous contents, of various sizes up to that of large peas, mixed with a considerable amount of fairly solid tissue of glandular appearance. In microscopic section it is found to consist mostly of glandular tissue of somewhat varied appearanceâ€”groups of small tubules with simple cylindrical epithelium, larger tubes lined with a rich stratified columnar epithelium, and the above- mentioned cysts, in which the epithelium is flattened by pressure. Between these epithelial structures there is a considerable but varying amount of connective tissue, in parts highly cellular like a piece of sarcoma, in other parts showing the characters of more or less fully developed connective tissue. There are also a few small nodules of cartilage and bone. The tumour may be described as a teratoma; probably connected with remains of the branchial clefts of the embryo. (W. of Scotland Clin. Res.

CYSTS OF THE KIDNEY. 543 which is loculated as if formed by the coalescence of several. Otherwise the kidney appears to be normal. These cysts are supposed to be of congenital origin, 41.42. Simple Cyst of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 83. A kidney laid open showing a large thin walled cyst project- ing from its lower end. Otherwise it appears to be normal. 41.43. Simple Cyst of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 84. A kidney showing a large cyst projecting from its lower end. It is opened, has thin transparent walls, and its cavity extends a considerable distance into the organ, which otherwise appears to have been normal. 41.44. Simple Cyst of the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 84a. A large kidney injected blue by the artery and vein, white by the ureter, showing a large thin walled cyst occupying and pro- jecting from its lower end. Otherwise apparently normal. 41.45. Cysts in a Granular Contracted Kidney. Hunterian. X. 84&. A kidney with the capsule in part torn off, showing the rough surface of a cirrhotic kidney. It is studded with cysts of various sizes, from very minute up to one nearly as large as a walnut, which has been laid open. The large cyst appears to be of the nature of the preceding, i.e. congenital; the minute ones are probably the result of the interstitial nephritis. (Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. VI., PI. VIII., fig. 1.) 41.46. Cysts in a Granular Contracted Kidney. Hunterian. X. 83. A kidney irregularly contracted, and presenting the rough surface of interstitial nephritis; showing one large cyst, and also myriads of minute ones scattered through its substance. The large one is probably congenital, the minute ones the result of the nephritis.

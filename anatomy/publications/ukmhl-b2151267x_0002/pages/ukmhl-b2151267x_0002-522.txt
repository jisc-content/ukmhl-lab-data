904 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. another with small irregular spaces between. The side towards whicli the nucleus lies is smooth with indistinct traces of nodulation ; the other is a mass of fine tubercles like the exterior of a calcium oxalate calculus. Nevertheless the stone is almost pure uric acid with only a small proportion of calcium oxalate. (Hunierian Plate XVII., fig. 6.) 53.32. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Fragments of a calculus about the size of a hen's egg, broken. The nucleus is absent; the outer parts consist of granular material with a decided tendency to radiate arrangement of the crystallization. Uric acid with only a minute trace of calcium oxalate. 53.33. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a flattened oval stone rather smaller than the preceding, partly laminated, partly granular, and its exterior finely tuberculated. Uric acid with distinct traces of calcium oxalate throughout. 53.34. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Part of a somewhat larger stone formed in alternating layers of dense laminated and loose granulated uric acid with a small admixture of calcium oxalate. Exterior roughly tuberculated. 53.35. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A small flattened oval stone, composed of fine wavy laminae of very dense uric acid mixed with a considerable amount of calcium oxalate. Smooth externally. 53.36. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a flattened oval calculus about the size of a plover's egg, consisting of a centre of granulated material and three layers—dense laminae, granulated, and again dense laminated—the last having a smooth external surface. The granulated layers contain more calcium oxalate than the others ; all show a very considerable trace of it.

ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 501 37.3. The Coverings of the Liver—the Peritoneum and Proper Areolar Coat. Hwnterian. U. 3. A portion of liver, showing the above turned down at one place and floating in the spirit. 37.4. The Coverings of the Liver—the Peritoneum and Proper Areolar Coat. Hunterian. U. 4. Similar to the- preceding, but more distinct. 37.5. The Blood-vessels of the Coverings of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 5. " The liver of a foetus about six months "; the arteries injected blue, showing the above. 37.6. The Vascularity of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 6. "A portion of the liver of a child injected red; it looks like a lump of vermilion from its vascularity; one set of vessels only was injected, viz., the vena portarum system, but, from the branches of the vena cava perhaps, the pori biliari and even the branches of the arteries are injected." Compare No. 37.8. 37.7. The Vascularity of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 7. " A portion of the liver of a child injected red ; redder if possible than the former." 37.8. The Portal Venous System of the Liver. Hunterian. U. 6. " A portion of the liver from a child some years after birth, in which, the ductus venosus being impervious, probably only the branches of the portal vein are injected." The vermilion being unable to pass the capillaries, the peripheral parts of the lobules are alone injected, forming a red network, enclosing round unin- jected areas, which are the areas of the capillary plexus of the hepatic veins.

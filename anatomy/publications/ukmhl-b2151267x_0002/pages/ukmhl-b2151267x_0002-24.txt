HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 406 central ones almost full grown, the lower lateral nearly in place, the upper lateral about the level of the gum, and twisted by the temporary canines, which are still in place and firmly fixed. The temporary molars are being pushed out. The permanent canines appear deeper than ever. The first permanent molars are com- plete. The original description says there were forty teeth visible ; now five have been lost; their capsules show where they were. Dry. 29.50. The Development of the Molar Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 73. Part of a left lower jaw, the alveolar processes removed inter- nally, showing the first two molars complete and the wisdom tooth with its crown about the level of the edge of the alveolus, and its root partly formed Dry. 29.51. The Formation of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 24. Two transverse sections of the lower jaw, gums, and teeth, showing the above. The crown of the tooth is seen enveloped in a vascular capsule. The enamel is most advanced, and covers the top and sides of the dentine cap; the hollow in the base of the latter is occupied by the highly vascular pulp, which, however, has shrunk very much, the specimen having been dried. Compare Nos. 29.65-69. 29.52. The Formation of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 25. Two more sections of the same jaw. Similar to the preceding. 29.53. The Formation and Growth of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP. 61. Twelve growing teeth in different stages, showing that the crown is developed first, in the form of several little caps of dentine, which coalesce (compare No. 38) and grow thicker from beneath, while the enamel is deposited on them from above. By the time the crown is complete, the enamel is thick and well-formed on the sides as well as the top of the tooth (compare Nos. 29.51 and 52). After this, the root begins to be formed by additions to the deep surface of the crown. Mounted dry on blue paper.

488 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 36.76. Tubercular Ulceration of the Intestines. Perfora- tion. Peritonitis. Hunterian. P. 25. Not described. A portion of small intestine injected red, showing extensive and irregular ulceration with perforation at one point. There is a thick fibrinous exudation on the outside. The injection produces a marked contrast between the vascular mucous membrane and the avascular tubercular ulcer and fibrin. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 66.) 36. 77. Tubercular Ulceration of the Intestines. Perfora- tion. Peritonitis. Hunterian. P. 96. Two or three loops of intestine injected red, extensively affected by tubercular ulceration resulting in perforation and peritonitis. The peritonitis has produced a glueing together of the coils, and the contraction of the ulcers inside has shut off one coil, which is seen considerably distended. The injection shows the vascularity of the intestines, and the avascularity of the sloughs and tubercular growths in the ulcers. At several points on the peritoneal surface, corresponding to ulcers, there is a fibrinous exudation; this is especially noticeable in the neighbourhood of the perforations. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 65.) 36.78. Tubercular Ulcers of the Jejunum. Perforation. Peritonitis. Hunterian. P. 101. " Portion of the intestine : man died of fever. On opening the abdomen there was every appearance of child-bed fever, or abdominal inflammation." ("Almack's Servant.") The peritoneum is covered with a fibrinous exudation. There is a small perforation in the floor of one of the ulcers. 36.79. Tubercular Ulcers of the Intestine. Perforations. Peritonitis. Hunterian. P. 103. (Not described.) A long portion of the small intestine, with its mesentery, unopened, showing a number of dark patches—necroses of the peritoneum—several of which have resulted in perforation. A small portion laid open shows a typical tubercular ulcer.

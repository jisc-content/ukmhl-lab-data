HUNTER!A N A NA TOMIC. IL C. I T. IIJXIUE. 888 52.114. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Jlinitn-imi. A similar concretion slightly larger, cut and ground. The cut face has a coat of varnish to preserve it; shows the concentric lamination very clearly. 52.115. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hiutkrian. Half of a somewhat larger rounded cubical calculus. *52.116. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A concretion of oval shape, cut. The oval shape is due to the nucleus consisting of two calculi about the size of peas agglutinated together. The small calculi are of the same composition as the large, viz., principally triple phosphate. Measures 10 by 8 cm. {Hunterian Plate V., fig. 3.) *52.117. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A somewhat similar stone, cut, of oval shape, with a sharp constriction round the middle of its long dimension producing a shape which suggests that it has arisen by the fusion of two stones. The lamination of the cut surface shows it to be a single formation around a long thin nucleus (which is not present). {Hunterian Plate VIII., figs. 3 and 4.) *52.118. Triple Phosphate Concretion. Hunterian. A concretion, cut, which appears to be composed of eight spherical concretions agglutinated together, but which the cut surface shows to be of single formation about a very minute round nucleus. The laminae at first are in the form of a square, then a bulging of them about the angles and indentation in the middle of the sides appears, and gradually becomes more and more pronounced till the final deeply lobulated shape is reached. The following note in William Hunter's handwriting accompanies the sketch of the calculus. " This cluster of stones was found in the great gut of a dray stone-horse belonging to Mr. Melyn ; which horse died in 1732. It weighed 12^ oz. avoirdupois. I bought it at Dr. Letherland's sale." The lobulation of the concretion is undoubtedly due to its being formed in the great

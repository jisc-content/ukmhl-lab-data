THE DECIDUA IN THE EARLY MONTHS. 735 48.190. Chorion and Amnion. Hmterian. BE. 244. An ovum "about seven weeks," showing the two foetal mem- branes separated from one another. 48.191. Decidua, Chorion and Amnion, about the Fourth Month. Hunterian. EE. 245. A portion of an ovum, of considerable size, showing the above three membranes. The decidua was becoming thinner and more lace-like. It was not j'et united firmly with the chorion. 48.192. Decidua and Foetal Membranes Separated. Hunterian. EE. 288. " A small portion of decidua, not injected; the amnion and chorion are partly detached, showing the opacity of the decidua better from contrast with the other two membranes which are transparent." 48.193. Decidua and Foetal Membranes. Hunterian. EE. 289. "A portion of secundine, showing the different membranes"; particularly the thread-like remains of villi on the outside of the chorion, which attach it to the decidua. 48.194. Foetal Blood-vessels of the Placenta. Hmterian. EE. 224. "An ovum, with the shaggy vessels of chorion injected red to great minuteness; hardened, and put into oil of turpentine." The specimen is a fairly young placenta unravelled, the vessels of the chorionic villi having been previously injected with vermilion. 48.195. Foetal Blood-vessels of the Placenta. Hunterian. EE. 224a. Similar to the preceding.

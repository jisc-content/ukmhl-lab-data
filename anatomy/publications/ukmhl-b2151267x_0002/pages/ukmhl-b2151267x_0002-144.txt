526 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. large trunks branch mostly in the region between cortex and medulla, and send innumerable branches into the former, which is evidently exceedingly vascular, and but few into the latter. In some places the red injection has entered the vessels of the glomeruli or Malpighian bodies, which "are seen hanging like berries on a bush from the arteries"; a lens is required to make this out properly ; it is seen best about the lower end. The white injection ha.s disappeared. The tubuli uriniferi can be traced the whole length of the pyramids. The specimen should be examined by transmitted, as well as by reflected light. 40.28. The Absence of Anastomoses in the Branches of " One half of a kidney injected by different branches of the artery with black, red, and white, to show that these do not anastomose as in other parts of the bod}'. Pelvis injected yellow." At least the anastomoses are very small, if not altogether absent; i.e. the arteries of the kidney are end arteries, like those of the spleen and cortex of the brain, an anatomical fact which becomes of importance if one of them gets blocked {e.g. by embolism), when the whole area supplied by it gets cut off from the circula- tion and commonly undergoes necrosis. 40.29. The Absence of Anastomoses in the Branches of Other half of the preceding. 40.30. The Vascularity of the Kidney. Eunterian. X. 26. "A portion of injected kidney, to show the vascularity of the cortical part." The medulla is fairly vascular also, numerous straight arteries running among the tubules. The cortex is speckled as if with spots of vermilion, which are the Malpighian bodies with their blood-vessels injected. 40.31. The Vascularity of the Kidney. Eunterian. X. 28. A thin slice of kidney, finely injected red, dried, and mounted on black paper in turpentine. With a lens it shows the glomeruli fairly well. the Renal Artery. Eunterian. X. 9. the Renal Artery.

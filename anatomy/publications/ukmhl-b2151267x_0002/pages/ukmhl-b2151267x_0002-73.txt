LYMPHATIC FOLLICLES OF THE INTESTINE. 455 35.47. The Solitary Lymphatic Follicles of the Jejunum. Hunter Ian. F. 46. A portion of jejunum finely injected red and inverted, showing a number of the above, mostly projecting from the edges of the valvulae conniveutes. They are of a beautiful pink colour, not quite so deep as that of the surrounding villous or glandular surface. 35.48. The Solitary Lymphatic Follicles. Eunierkm. P. 89. A piece of jejunum, formerly injected red, now turned black, showing very distinctly a large number of the above. The former printed catalogue says, " the follicular appearance on the valvulae conniventes is probably from scrofulous suppuration," a curious error, considering that William Hunter in his anatomy lectures describes these structures as normal, and probably of the same nature as the Peyer's patches. On microscopic examination they appeared to be nothing but the normal lymphatic follicles. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 70.) 35.49. The Solitary Lymphatic Follicles. Himterian. F. 47. A portion of the intestine about the region of transition from jejunum to ileum, injected red and inverted, showing the above. The valvulae conniventes are few in number and small. 35.50. The Solitary and Agminated Lymphatic Follicles. Hunterian. P. 48. A similar portion of intestine, from the same position as the preceding, finely injected red, showing both of the above. 35.51. The Solitary and Agminated Lymphatic Follicles. Hunterian. P. 48rt. Similar to the preceding; lower down in the ileum. THE THREE REGIONS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE. 35.52. The Duodenum. Hunterian. F. 50. A portion of the first part of the small intestine, injected red and inverted, showing its thick villous mucous membrane; the

503 AA'ATOMY OF THE PANCREAS. The Pancreas. 37.16. The Pancreas. Hunterian. W. 1. Dissected out, and mounted so as to shoAv the long flattened tail portion, and thick head. To the latter is still attached the portion of the duodenum, into which the duct opens by a common orifice with the bile duct. A bristle is passed into the pancreatic duct, and another through the common bile duct, from this orifice. 37.17. The Pancreas macerated to show its Lobulation. Hunterian. IF. 2. 37.18. The Pancreatic Ducts. Hunterian. W. 3. A pancreas, the ducts of Wirsung injected red and dissected. A long duct runs the whole length of the tail, and a short one from the lower part of the head joins it near their termination in the duodenum. 37.19. Pancreas Injected with Mercury. Hunterian. W. 5. In turpentine. The lower part only of the pancreas. Not transparent. Comparative Anatomy Specimens. 37.20. The Pancreatic Ducts. Cat. Hunterian. W. 7. Pancreas of cat, the duct and its branches finely injected with mercury, and mounted in turpentine. 37.21. The Bile Duct and Duodenum of an Elephant. Hunterian. U. 32. " A portion of the duodenum and gall ducts in the elephant, to show its size and entrance into the intestine ; this animal has no gall bladder." The duodenum at the point of entrance of the duct is thrown into deep recesses, which may serve for storage of the bile.

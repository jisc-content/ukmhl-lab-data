THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH. 403 distinguished from the dentine is this preparation. Mounted in spirit on blue paper. 29. 38. The Lower Jaw of a " Child at Birth." Hunterian. PP. 49. All the teeth are exposed, showing the crowns of the ten deciduous teeth fully formed. The crowns have been developed from as many points of ossification as there are cusps, and the germ of the first molar, which is also exposed, shows this—the shape of the crown is there in soft vascular tissue, but only the outer anterior cusp of it has developed a cap of dentine. This cap is clearly distinguishable from the vascular papilla; the tips of the other cusps are opaque, as if the dentine were beginning to cover them too. On blue paper, in spirit. Possibly the preparation from which fig. 3 of Plate VIII. was taken. 29.39. The Upper and Lower Jaws " of a Child at Birth." Hunterian. PP. 63«. Highly injected red and mounted in turpentine. All the teeth are exposed, showing the crowns formed but below the gum. The capsules and papillae of the teeth appear highly vascular. 29.40. The Vascular Tooth Papilla. Hunterian. PP. 53. An upper jaw " of a child at birth," with the canine and two molars in situ, highly injected red, decalcified, the soft parts removed, dried, and mounted in turpentine, showing the above shining through the transparent animal matrix of the teeth. 29.41. The Eruption of the Teeth. Hunterian. PP.81. The lower jaw, tongue, and larynx of a child at " about nine or ten months old," highly injected red, and mounted in turpen- tine, showing three incisor teeth above the gum, and the fourth just on the point of breaking through, being covered only by a thin vascular membrane. Several of the other teeth are nearing the surface of the gum, and the germ of the first permanent molar is seen in its follicle, which has been cut open.

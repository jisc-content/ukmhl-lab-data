SERIES 53. URINARY CALCULI. This series includes all calculi from the various parts of the genito-urinary system in which such bodies are found; it includes, therefore, prostatic calculi. There are in the series 178 specimens â€”all but three of which are urinary calculi. As to the history of the specimens, classification, etc., vide introduction to Calculi in General at the beginning of Series 52. In this series there are, in addition to the Hunterian calculi, a few taken from a small collec- tion of unknown history presented to the museum by Professor P. A. Simpson. A few of these were valuable from having short notes of their history attached, and were therefore added to the series. Calculi of Uric Acid, .....

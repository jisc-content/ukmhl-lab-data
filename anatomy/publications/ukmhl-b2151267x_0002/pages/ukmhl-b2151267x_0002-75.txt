Hunterian. R. 8. A portion of the above inverted and the mucous coat removed "to show the circular muscular fibres." 35.60. The Ileo-colic Valve, Caput Caecum Coli, and Appendix Vermiformis. Hunterian. R. 4. The above structures with the lower end of the ileum "dis- tended with spirit, and when hardened a considerable portion on one side was removed to look on the entering of the ileum into the colon which is at right angles; it has the appearance of contracting and diffusing rather than of insertion into the colon; the villous coat of the ileum seems reflected back on the colon after its entrance, which is by means of a slit in the direc- tion of, and, as it were, between the circular fibres of the colon, on the side next the sacrum." 35.61. The Caput Caecum Coli, Ileo-colic Valve, and Vermiform Appendix. Hunterian. R. 4a. A similar preparation but hanging in its natural position, show- ing the slit-like aperture of the valve. 35.62. The Caput Caecum Coli Inverted. Hunterian. B. 5. To show the puckering of the mucous membrane corresponding with that of the muscular walls. There are no villi. Partly distended with spirit.

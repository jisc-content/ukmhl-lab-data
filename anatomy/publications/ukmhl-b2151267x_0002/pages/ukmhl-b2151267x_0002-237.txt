The right ovary was reduced to an abscess cavity buried in adhesions; its remains were scraped out, and the cavity plugged with an antiseptic dressing.

Uterus and Fallopian tubes, of which the following history was given by Dr. Kelly:â€”"J.H., aet. 33; unipara.

The lower part of the preparation shows the left Fallopian tube, ovary, and broad ligament matted together and bound to the side of the uterus by fibrous adhesions; the tube alone is recognizable; it is laid open. Supravaginal amputation of the uterus was the only operation which was possible. The tube is greatly enlarged in every way, convoluted, stretched, and bent, as if round the ovary for centre, into a complete circle; it measures fully 22 cm. in length. Its diameter close to the uterus is nearly 2 cm., and increases gradually to nearly 4 cm. towards its outer end. Its walls, in different parts, measure from 2 to 6 mm. in thickness. The remains of the fimbriated extremity can be recog- nized close to the side of the uterus on the rounded end of the tube. The other tube is an ordinary small pyosalpinx. 45.21.

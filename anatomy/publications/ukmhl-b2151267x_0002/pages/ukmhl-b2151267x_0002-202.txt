HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 584 The hypertrophy affects the whole gland, but principally the middle and left lobes, both of which project very strongly into the bladder. The urethra is very tortuous. The bladder is very much fascicu- lated, and it is through some of the pouches behind that the extravasation has occurred, producing extensive abscesses over the back of the organ. 43.25. Prostatic Calculi. Hunterian. A A. 28. A portion of the bladder, prostate gland, and urethra, showing a number of round brown stones embedded in the prostate about the sides of the caput gallinaginis. They are " naked towards the urethra, and surrounded by a ragged ulcerated surface. These probably would give the stroke to the sound on searching, and would be mistaken for stone in the bladder." Compare next specimen. The back part of the prostate is dissected to show a number of similar calculi embedded in its substance. 4-3.26. Prostatic Calculi. Hunterian. AA. 29. A prostate gland, with the neck of the bladder, showing a number of rounded brown calculi, about the size of hemp seeds, lodged by the sides of the caput gallinaginis. These might have given the stroke to the sound in searching and led to an erroneous diagnosis of stone in the bladder; William Hunter mentions in his lectures that he was once misled in this way himself. Compare preceding specimen. This specimen is figured in Matthew Baillie's Engravings, Fasc. VIII., PI. II., fig. 2. IV. Changes due to Inflammatory Diseases of the Bladder and Genital Organs. 43.27. Abscesses in a Hypertrophied Prostate Gland, apparently connected with Lithotomy. Hunterian. AA. 39aa. " A portion of bladder with a diseased prostate gland, very thick ; there is some appearance of the patient having been cut for the stone; and there must have been abscess on the under side of the prostate, as here is a large cavity with a rough surface, which has been opened. (Falconar's sale.)" The hole in the prostatic portion

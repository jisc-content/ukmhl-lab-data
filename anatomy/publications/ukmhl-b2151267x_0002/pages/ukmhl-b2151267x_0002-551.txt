PEOSPHATIC CALCULI. 933 53.160. Mixed Phosphate Calculus—from the Kidney. Himterian. A stone somewhat similar in shape to the preceding, its exterior composed of mixed phosphates. Not cut. 53.161. Mixed Phosphate and Oxalate Calculus—from the Kidney. Hunterian. A smaller calculus, evidently from its branched shape renal, composed of mixed phosphates round a mass, apparently spherical, of calcium oxalate. Not cut. Qj) Nucleus a Foreign Body. *53.162. Mixed Phosphate Calculus with Nucleus a Piece of Lead. Hunterian. A heart-shaped calculus nearly as large as a hen's egg, of the fusible compound, largely triple phosphates, with a good deal of urate of ammonium. Its nucleus is a piece of lead like a portion of a bougie, about 2 mm. in diameter; probably a portion of one of the old-fashioned lead bougies. There is a straight portion about 2-5 cm. long, forming the axis of the calculus, with a hook at one end which has been coated only to a very slight extent, and that too with brown calcium oxalate. [Himterian Plate XIX., fig. 10.) *53.163. Mixed Phosphate Calculus with Nucleus a Lock of Hair. Hunterian. An oval mass of mixed phosphates as large as a pigeon's egg, broken at one end showing a lock of hair (human)—part embedded in it, part free and thinly crusted with the same material. " A lock of hair incrusted with calculous matter." {Hunterian Plate XIX., fig. 8.) *53.164. " A Lock of Hair Incrusted with Calculous Matter." Hunterian. A large lock of human hair thinly crusted with mixed phos- phates. {Hunterian Plate XIX., fig. 1.)

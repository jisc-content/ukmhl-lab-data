A calculus of irregular oval shape, not much bigger than a hemp seed, consisting of calcium oxalate in small sharp pointed particles. It was passed per urdhrani by a working miner at Rio Tinto, Southern Spain, after a severe attack of typical renal colic lasting several hours. The pain was felt most in the left loin; it was more or less constant but rising to severe spasms, and darting down to the left testicle, which was strongly drawn up during the spasms. The pain was partly relieved by a hypodermic injection of morphia. It entirely ceased abruptly about half an hour after this was adminis- tered, and the calculus was passed along with a large amount of urine a few minutes later.

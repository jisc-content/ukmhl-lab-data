COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE PLACENTA. 745 of the chorion which have not shared in the formation of the placenta are also highly vascular—some areas more so than others; the more vascular areas are distinctly villous, but the villi are very small. The villi of the placentulae appear to have drawn clean out of the maternal crypts, there being, as in the preceding diffused placentae, no shedding of a definite decidua. 48.235. Foetal Part of Placentula of Cow. Huntcrian. Eli. 317. Similar to the preceding but larger; the chorionic villi of the placentula are much larger; they have separated from the maternal part of the placentula quite as cleanly, and without anything like a definite decidua adhering to them. The non- placental areas of the chorion contain a number of vessels, though less than in the preceding. 48.236. Foetal Part of Placentula of Cow. Hunterian. BR. 319. Similar to No. 48. 233, dried and mounted in turpentine. 48.237. Foetal Part of Placentula of Cow. Hunterian. EE. —. Similar to the preceding. Mounted in turpentine. 48.238. Foetal Part of Placentula of Cow. Hunterian. EE. —. Similar to the preceding. In turpentine. 48.239. Chorion and Foetal Part of a Placentula. Hunterian. EE. 107a. (Not described.) A portion of chorion with one placentula, from which the maternal part has been detached. The placentula is much smaller than any of the preceding. It is finely injected red. The non-placental area of chorion is highly vascular, especially where it is covered with processes, which are mostly like villi, but some of them short ridges. Between these are less vascular lines and areas.

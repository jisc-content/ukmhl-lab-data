HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 632 45. 66. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. CO. 98. "Vagina and uterus slit open from behind; os tincae, cervix uteri, and upper part of vagina destroyed by an ulcer; commonly termed cancer of the uterus." Microscopic examination shows that it is a carcinoma of the cylinder-celled glandular type. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 126.) 45.67. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri, fungating into the Bladder. Hunterian. CC. 100. " Vagina and uterus slit open from behind; bladder also opened from before; ulceration also smaller about os tincae, about the size of a shilling; same appearance in the bladder in the side tiext uterus." There is comparatively little tumour and ulceration about the os uteri, but the ulcer in the floor of the bladder is large and fairly prominent. Microscopic examination only shows that it has been a highly cellular carcinoma; it is very much degenerated. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 127.) 45.68. Carcinoma of the Uterus with Extensive Ulcera- tion. Hunterian. CC. 57a. "Uterus, vagina, and bladder of a woman from the dissecting room, all laid open; cervix uteri and upper part of vagina all cancerous and ragged; a large opening also between vagina and bladder, sufficient to pass a walnut." The ureters pass right into masses of cancer-infiltrated tissue; their orifices appear to be intact; marked with bougies. The tissues are extremely de- generated through time, but show sufficient to confirm the old diagnosis of a malignant ulceration. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 118.) 45.69. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Advanced. Hunterian. CC. 101. Posterior half of uterus and vagina, showing the above. There is extensive ulceration, almost the whole cervix and the upper part of the vagina being destroyed. 45. 70. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Advanced. Hunterian. CC. 101a. The whole uterus with part of the vagina. The bladder and

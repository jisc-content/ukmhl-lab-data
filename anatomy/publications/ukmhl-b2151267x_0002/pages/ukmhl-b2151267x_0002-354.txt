RUNTERhiN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 736 48.196. Development of the Foetal Blood-vessels. Hunterian. BR. 225. "Three ova of different sizes with the shaggy vessels (of the chorion) injected to great minuteness." The specimens are fairly young placentae beautifully injected with vermilion. 48.197. The Remains of the Umbilical Vesicle near Term. Hunterian. EE. 222. A portion of foetal membranes, spread upon blue paper, history unknown, but clearly at an advanced stage of gestation, showing the white spot ("vesicula alba") between the amnion and chorion, into which the umbilical vesicle degenerates. There is no distinct trace of the vitelline duct, but several white threads pass from the vesicle, one of which may represent it. Compare Nos. 48. 165 to 48.170. 48.198. The Remains of the Umbilical Vesicle near Term. Hunterian. EE. â€”. Similar to the preceding. 48.199. Remains of the Omphalo-meseraic or Vitelline Circulation about the Fifth Month. Hunterian. (Not numbered nor described.) A foetus about the fifth month, the anterior parietes of the thorax and abdomen removed, except the umbilicus, which is held in position by the umbilical cord and vessels. Part of the liver is removed to show the umbilical vein. Below and to the right of this a considerable length of intestines is stretched out by a bristle, over which lies a little cord rising from the mesentery. This is all that remains of the circulation (called omphalo-meseraic, omphalo-mesenteric, or vitelline), which existed on the umbilical vesicle, and conveyed nutriment from it to the foetus, prior to the development of the placenta. 48.200. Remains of the Omphalo-meseraic Circulation about the Seventh Month. Hunterian. (Not numbered nor described.) Trunk of a foetus about the seventh month, the whole anterior parietes and the liver removed.

EMBRYOLOGY. SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM. 841 51.2. Formation of the Blastoderm and Embryo of a Mammal. (After BischofF.) From Dr. Allen Thomson!s Collection. The remaining thirteen models of the same series as the preceding, showing the steps from the formation of the blastoderm and the diflferentiation of the embryonic area to the first formation of the embryo. 51.3. Segmentation of the Egg of the Frog. (After Ecker.) From, Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The first twelve of a series of twenty-five wax models, illustrating the segmentation of the egg, and the development of the tadpole of the frog (Rana temporaria), after Ecker, Icones Physiologicae. Entlauterungstafeln zur Physiologie unci Entwickelungsgeschichte (Atlas of Physiology and Embryology), PI. XXIII. This case of models shows complete (holoblastic) and unequal segmentation, the whole ovum dividing into two sets of cells of different size and having different characters. 51.4. Development of the Tadpole of the Frog. (After Ecker.) From Dr. Allen Tho)nson's Collection. Other ten wax models of the same series as the preceding, illus- trating the earlier stages in the development of the tadpole. 51.5. Development of the Tadpole of the Frog. (After Ecker.) From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The remaining three models of the above series, illustrating the completion of the development of the tadpole from the ovum. No. 21 partl3'' dissected to show the internal and external gills. 51.6. Development of the Egg in the River Trout. (After Oellacher.) From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The first ten of a series of twenty-one wax models illustrating the above. The series shows meroblastic segmentation, only a small part of the ovum (the germinal disc) undergoing cleavage to form the blastoderm, the rest remaining undivided as the nutritive part of the egg (yolk). Models 1-10 segmentation.

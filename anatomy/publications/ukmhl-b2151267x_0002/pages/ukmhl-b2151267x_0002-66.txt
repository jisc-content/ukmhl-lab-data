448 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 35. 4. The Peritoneal and Muscular Coats of the Intestines. Hmterian. P. 5. Similar to the preceding, showing the longitudinal fibres more clearly. 35.5. The Muscular Coat of the Intestines. Hunterian. P. 6. A portion of small intestine inverted, boiled, and the mucous coat scraped off to show the cii'cular muscular fibres. 35. 6. The Muscular Coat of the Intestines. Hunterian. P. &a. A portion of small intestine distended with spirit, not boiled, showing the longitudinal and circular muscular fibres in their natural condition. 35.7. The Muscular Coat of the Intestine. Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. Two portions of small intestine prepared to show the above, the peritoneal coat stripped off both. The one shows the external longitudinal muscular fibres, which are raised at one part to show the internal circular fibres; the other shows the two layers of muscle, which have also in part been dissected away to show the deep surface of the mucous coat. 35.8. The Coats of the Intestines. Hunterian. P. 7. A portion of the small intestine coarsely injected red, slit open along its free border, and dissected into three layers. It is hung by a thin transparent membrane, which is the mucous membrane separated from the submucous layer along the line of the muscularis mucosae, which seems for the most part to have come with it. This membrane shows numerous fine blood-vessels, and, here and there, opacities due to the solitary lymphatic follicles which have come away with it. The second layer, part of which is turned down to show its inner surface, part cleared of the muscular coat to show its outer surface, is the submucous tissue with some of the circular muscular fibres adhering to it. This is the layer in which the

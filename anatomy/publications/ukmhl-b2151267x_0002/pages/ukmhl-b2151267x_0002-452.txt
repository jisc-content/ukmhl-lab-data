834 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. in the site of the anterior fontanelle, which have been closed by membrane only. The sagittal suture is not recognizable, but at a considerable distance on either side of the median plane there is a distinct suture running from the coronal suture (about 5 cm.) towards the centre of the parietals. Circumference, 63 cm. (24| inches). Diameters—sagittal, 20 cm.; transverse, 18'5cm.; vertical, 18-5 cm. 50. 111. Hydrocephalus. Human. HuntRrian. Vault of a very large hydrocephalic skull. The sutures are much less distinct and better closed than in any of the preceding. There is a small membranous area in the site of the anterior fontanelle. The shape in the horizontal plane is a fair oval, there being no undue prominence of the frontal or parietal eminences. Probably from an adult. The greatest breadth is about the parietal eminences. Circumference, 66 cm. (26 inches). Diameters—sagittal 23 cm.; transverse, 18 cm. (e) fissura abdominalis (eventration ; celosomie). defective formation and non-closure of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. 50.112. Hernia into the Umbilical Cord. Human. Hunteriim. MM. 54. "An umbilical rupture in a child at birth." A portion of the abdominal wall, with a large bunch of intestines and part of the umbilical cord, injected red. The membranous sac is mostly cut away. It appears clearly to have been formed from the beginning of the umbilical cord. 50.113. Hernia into the Umbilical Cord. Human. Hunterian. MM. 18. (Aspalosorae.) "A child about the sixth month; the anterior parietes of the abdomen for some way round the navel are wanting, and in their place peritoneum is stretched out into a bag, in which a considerable portion of the abdominal viscera, equal in size to a small egg, are contained." The sac is not peritoneum alone, but is a

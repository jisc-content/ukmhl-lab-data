608 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. organ. Between the ovary and the outer end of the Fallopian tube there may be seen, on holding it up to the light, a number of parallel curved tubes which appear to be the organ of Rosenmiiller or parovariumâ€”the remains of the Wolffian ducts and tubules ; not a good specimen of this structure. 44.43. The Fimbriated Extremity of the Fallopian Tube. Hunterian. CC. 42. Part of the broad ligament well sjDread out to show the fimbriae making a regular double fringe for about an inch between the orifice of the tube and the ovary. 44.44. The Fallopian Tube. Hunterian. CC. 43. "Fallopian tube slit open its whole length, to show that it is broader near the external, and narrow, very narrow, towards the uterus; its inner surface is also thrown into longitudinal rugae, like those internal surfaces which are occasionally to be distended." (d) The Mammary Glands. 44.45. The Mammary Gland of a Girl at Puberty. Hunterian. DD. 1. "A perpendicular section through the nipple and body of the mamma, from a girl at puberty, so as to look on the cut edges; the integuments are in situ; the gland is somewhat circular, and about three inches in diametei', and one in thickness at the centre; the substance of the gland is injected red, and is easily dis- tinguished by its red white, from the yellow white of the intermixed lumps of fat." The glands are from the same subject as the uterus and appendages which form No. 44.18. 44.46. The Mammary Gland of a Girl at Puberty. Hunterian. DD. 2. " A horizontal section of the mamma of the opposite side, from the same girl; shows very well the intermixture of fat with the glandular substance, also that the very centre is all substance of gland without the least fat."

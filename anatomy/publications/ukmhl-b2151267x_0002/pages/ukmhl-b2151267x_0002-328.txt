710 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. Hunter meant by " cells" and " cellular part" or " cellular struc- ture," the intervillous maternal blood-spaces of the placenta, his latest editor, Rigby (1843), has very wrongly taken him to have meant the cellular or areolar tissue of the organ. The intervil- lous blood-spaces are also very well shown, filled with injection, in Nos. 48.140 and 48.148. 48.136. Uterine Blood-vessels Supplying the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 128. "A section of the uterus, with its vessels injected black, which are very large and project upon the inside, where they were continued into the substance of the placenta." The arteries are comparatively small, but the veins very large. The injection mass has broken down and fallen out of the orifices to a considerable extent. 48.137. The Uterine Veins of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 124. " A small portion of the uterus and placenta, where the cells of the placenta have been injected from the veins of the uterus; the veins are seen very large, entering into the substance of the placenta: injection green." 48.138. The Uterine Veins of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 124a. Similar to the preceding. 48.139. The Uterine Veins of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 125. "Another portion of the same, showing the cells of the placenta injected from the uterine veins, and especially two corresponding veins, which were passing from the uterus to the placenta and ruptured by the placenta being detached." 48.140. The Maternal Blood-spaces of the Placenta. "Placental Cells." Hunterian. RR. 140Â«. A portion of the placenta injected red by the umbilical vessels.

440 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. IV. Inflammatory Diseases of the Stomach. 34.12. Inflammation of the Stomach. Hunterian. 0. 51. A " portion of the oesophagus and stomach of (Mr. Hnme) a person who died of the gout in his stomach; there was consider- able inflammation, even in some places to extravasation, as may be seen, the blood having been coagulated in the vessels and cellular membrane by means of distilled vinegar." These appear- ances have faded now. 34.13. Inflammation of the Stomach. Hunterian. 0. 52. Another portion of the preceding. 34.14. Simple Stricture of the Pylorus. Hunterian. 0. 50t. 'â€¢ A portion of the small end of the stomach (inverted) from a woman in the dissecting room; there is a stricture of the pylorus which barely admits a quill; there are also a great many prune-stones which were found in the stomach, and which could not pass the pylorus." There is slight thickening about the pylorus, especially about the gastric side of it, but nothing in the mucous membrane to suggest carcinoma or an old ulcer. Probably a simple fibrous stricture. V. Tumours of the Oesophagus and Stomach. 34.15. Fibroma of the Stomach. Leopard. Hunterian. 0. 53a. " A portion of the leopard's stomach," inverted; on the inside is seen a rounded tumour about the size of a walnut, very hard, "with a hole in the top passing towards its basis about half an inch, and which seemed to discharge pus." On microscopic exam- ination it is found to be a fibroma, which has been undergoing necrosis and softening in the centre, where it is umbilicated. It is covered with mucous membrane and a layer of muscle. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 26.)

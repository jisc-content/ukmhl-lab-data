HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 754 "The placenta and membranes of a kitten. On the membrane in one place is seen an artery and vein meeting : the first white, the other black. This is either the origin of a vein, or it may be the injection returning from the artery at one place by the vein stopping till the venal injection meets it." 48.269. Foetal Rodent showing Discoidal Deciduate Placenta. Hunterian. (Not numbered nor described.) Apparently a nearly full-grown foetal rabbit enclosed in the amnion, with the remains of the chorion and the placenta; maternal vessels injected red. The placenta is placed on the left side of the foetus near its middle. It is round, discoid, and very like the human. It is finely lobulated. Parts of its surface are injected, parts not. It shows the orifices of several large vessels torn across in separating it from the uterus. Compare Series 47, Generation ; Rabbits. 48.270. Discoidal Deciduate Placenta of Rodent. Hunterian. (Not numbered nor described.) A portion of uterine wall, and a placenta similar to that in the preceding specimen ; the maternal vessels injected red. The placenta has been almost completely torn from the uterus, leaving a site very like that which is seen in the human subject. The interlacing muscular fibres appear to be laid bare, and between them are the mouths of numerous large torn vessels. Orifices corresponding to these are, but with some difficulty, distinguishable on the corresponding surface of the placenta. 48. 271. Foetal Sloth with Discoid Lobulated Placenta. Hunterian. This specimen is neither numbered nor described, but appears to be Hunterian. The foetus is enveloped in a smooth, white, semi- transparent membraneâ€”the amnion fitting it closely at all points, and presenting the appearance of a hairless skin. At several points it is burst, showing the real hairy skin of the animal. It is about the size of a five months' human foetus. From the umbilicus

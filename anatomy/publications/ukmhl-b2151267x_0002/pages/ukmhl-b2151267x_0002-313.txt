695 THE PLACENTA. veins of the uterus are seen very large and numerous." Shows also the spongy texture of the placenta due to the intervillous spaces (maternal blood-cells) being empty. 48.102. Uterine Placental Veins. Hunterian. RR. 103. " A section of the uterus, injected by the veins a dark green, the veins are very large, and on the inside there is a breaking off of the injection and large orifices, where the veins were ruptured and had passed to the placenta." The injection has dissolved but the empty mouths of the veins are very distinct. 48.103. Muscular Fibres about the Orifices of the Uterine Veins of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 105. " A section of the uterus injected red with fine injection, and inverted; it seems to have been previously dried ; on the inside may be seen lying over bristles, irregular fasciculi of muscular fibres, the fibrous appearance of which is very distinct." The bristles lie in the oblique orifices of veins, passing in by one and out by another, which shows the free anastomosis existing between the uterine veins after they emerge from the placenta. The arrangement of the muscular fibres about the placental veins of the uterus, shown here, is supposed to be of great importance in the arrest of haemorrhage after separation of the placenta in labour, because, when the uterus contracts, they constrict the mouths of the torn veins, and prevent the plugs of blood clot blocking them from being dislodged.

"A section of uterus, with membranes partly turned down, and showing a double layer of decidua." The exact date of the preparation in relation to impregnation not knownâ€”appar- ently in the latter half of pregnancy. The uppermost of the turned down laminae is the outer (or deep) layer of the decidua, which is also called the spongy layer from being pervaded by

873 ANIMAL HAIR BALLS. the long axis, {vide No. 52.52). Others are coated with a thin hard shell which consists of phosphates, chiefly of calcium, some triple phosphates, and traces of the earthy carbonates mixed with organic matters, mucus, etc. In some of the calculi there are also vegetable fibres. Those that are cut show the hairs in the central parts less closely felted than at the exterior. None of them have a foreign body for a nucleus. 52.52. Hair Ball from the Stomach of the Cow. Hunterian. A very perfect example of the above concretion mounted in a glass jar. It is composed of closely felted brown hairs, which are recognizable under the microscope as cow's hairs. It is of spherical shape slightly lengthened in one diameter, which may be called its axis; it measures 9 cm. in this diameter and 8 cm. in its lesser diameter. The hairs of the outer layer are laid in circles around the axis with their points all in one direction as described in the introductory paragraph. 52.53. Hair Ball from the Stomach of the Cow. Hunterian. A similar concretion, slightly larger; in shape a much flattened sphere, measuring 11'5 cm. in the long by 6 cm. in the short diameter. 52.54. Hair Ball from a Camel. Hmterian. A ball of loosely felted brown hair about the size of a hen's egg. "From a Camel. Mr. Forbes." 52.55. Hair Ball from a Calf. A concretion about the size of No. 52.57 and of similar nature, but badly moth-eaten, which spoils its appearance. " Presented by Mr. Jenkins, from Mr. Alexr. Forsyth, flesher. Found in the intestines of a calf." 52.56. Hair Balls from the Cow. Hunterian. Three hair balls—one globular, the other two thick circular disc shaped—similar to the preceding. One of them shows a consider- able admixture of vegetable matter, chiefly bits of hay and straw. Moth-eaten.

HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 920 53.99. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a dark brown stone about the size of a hen's egg, of blunt oval shape, consisting of a large calcium oxalate calculus with small nucleus of uric acid, enclosed in an outer shell of uric acid mixed with some oxalate, which varies in thickness from 2 to 10 mm. The mulberry calculus is round, but the whole stone is oval from the uric acid being thin at the sides and thick at both ends. The exterior is very rough, but the points are not so sharp as in a simple calcium oxalate calculus, being more or less rounded off by the shell of uric acid. 53. ICQ. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A stone very similar to the preceding, consisting of a mulberry calculus with small urate of ammonium nucleus and thin external shell of uric acid. *53.101. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Similar to the preceding, but having a very much thicker shell of uric acid, from which circumstance its exterior, though rough, is not tuberculated like that of the preceding. The nucleus and some verj'- pale layers of the stone contain urate of ammonium. In section it is a very pretty stone from the various shades of yellow and brown and the crenated form of its different laminae. {Hun- terian Plate XVI., fig. 7.) *53.102. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. An oval stone rather larger than a hen's egg, very similar to the preceding. The nucleus is urate of ammonium, the oxalate stone is spherical, and the layer of uric acid thick enough to cover the points entirely. Its exterior has a rough water-worn appearance. *53.103. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus very similar to the preceding, but with the shell of uric acid formed only on the ends and in two bands running from

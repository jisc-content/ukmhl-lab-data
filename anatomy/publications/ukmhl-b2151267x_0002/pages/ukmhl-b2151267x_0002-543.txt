925 CALCIUM OXALATE CALCULI with mixed phosphates. There is an outside layer about 2 mm. thick, which is extremely hard, translucent, and showing traces of radiate crystallization. It consists of pure calcium oxalate. The surface of this is smooth and polished and studded with low rounded nodules, which are also smooth and polished. *53.123. Calculus of Calcium Oxalate and Mixed Phos- phates. Hunterian. Portion of a calculus, consisting of a mulberry calculus about the size of a damson, enclosed in a shell of mixed phosphates about 1-5 cm. thick, which has been removed from one end to show the rough exterior of the oxalate stone. {Hunterian Plate XVI, fig. 6.) 53.124. Calculus of Uric Acid (and Urate of Ammonium), Calcium Oxalate, and Phosphates. Hunterian. Half of a mulberry calculus of very irregular shape, the prongs to a large extent buried in phosphates. The central parts of the stone are for the most part of a very light colour, the lightest layers containing much urate of ammonium, the darker uric acid and â– calcium oxalate. 53.125. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. A mulberry calculus with relatively large centre of urate of ammonium, coated with phosphates so thickly as almost to bury its prongs though they happen to be very long. 53.126. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. Half of a similar calculus of smaller size. The centre and a white line about the middle of the oxalate portion contain ammonium urate. 53.127. Calcium Oxalate Calculus coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. Half of a calculus similar to the preceding, slightly smaller.

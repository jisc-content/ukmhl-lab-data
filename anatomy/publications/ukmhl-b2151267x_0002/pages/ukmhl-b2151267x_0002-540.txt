922 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. is partly smooth, partly finely tuberculated. The tubercles have a finely polished translucent appearance; they consist of practically pure calcium oxalate. 53.108. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A small spherical stone consisting of a relatively larger centre of uric acid and urate of ammonium, then a layer of dense dark brown calcium oxalate projecting in short prongs in the usual way, and lastly, on the ends of the prongs, bunches of fine crystals of calcium oxalate, giving to the stone an exceedingly rough and irregular exterior. 53.109. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A small irregularly oval stone. Its centre consists of calcium oxalate, mixed with a good deal of uric acid, in fine laminae, very compact and hard ; outside that a layer of bunches of calcium oxalate crystals, similar to the exterior of the preceding. 53.110. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a spherical stone similar in composition to the preceding. The outer layer of crystalline calcium oxalate more uniform and less aggregated into bunches than in the preceding. The crystals coarser; also in parts overlaid with a little uric acid ; very rough. 53. 111. Calcium Oxalate and Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a small stone of irregular shape, consisting of a centre of uric acid and urate of ammonium, then fine layers of calcium oxalate mixed with some uric acid, and an external, rather earthy looking, layer of calcium oxalate in irregular masses which show a decidedly crystalline tendency, similar to that in the preceding.

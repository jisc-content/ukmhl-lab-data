565 THE PENIS. size ; the corpora caveriaosa and spongiosum are injected green to show its shape ; six and a half inches long." The organ seems to be rather over-distended, and its thickness is very much exaggerated by the round jar. The scrotum has been removed with it, and sewn up around the ends of the corpora cavernosa. 42. 68. A Penis in the Erect Condition. Hunterian. BB. \a. A similar specimen '' of the same size nearly as the preceding." 42.69. A Penis in the Erect Condition. Hunterian. BB. 2. Another penis, cut off at the front of tlie scrotum after disten- sion with green injection, to show its shape. About six inches long (15'7 cm.). 42. 70. The Erectile Bodies of the Penis. Hunterian. BB. 3. A penis (hanging point downwards), over-distended with injection, removed entire from the body, and partly dissected. It is seen to be composed of two large masses of erectile tissue called corpora cavernosa, which are attached to either ramus of the pubic arch and a third—the corpus spongiosum urethrae—which is set below and between them. The corpus spongiosum is expanded anteriorly to form the glans penis. See succeeding specimens. 42.71. The Erectile Bodies of the Penis. Hunterian. BB. 4. A penis injected, the corpora cavernosa red, the corpus spon- giosum and glans penis with mercury; mounted dry showing the above. 42.72. The Glans Penis. Hunterian. BB. 42. The anterior portion of a penis distended with red injection, and the prepuce drawn back showing the above. At the point is seen the orifice of the urethra—meatus urinarius—beneath which the glans is grooved by a fold of skin stretching back to the prepuce called the frenum. The base of the glans forms a rounded collar, ■overlapping the ends of the corpora cavernosa. The constriction behind it is called the cervix or neck of the penis.

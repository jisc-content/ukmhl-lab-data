SERIES 52. CALCULI AND CONCRETIONS. Of calculi and concretions the collection contains 331 specimens,, which are placed in small boxes in two large glass-topped show cases. A few calculi also appear in other parts of the collection,. e.g., under diseases of the liver and gall bladder and diseases of the kidney. They have for convenience been arranged in two series : No. 52, Calculi and Concretions connected with the Alimentary System; and No. 53, Urinary Calculi, along with which are placed Prostatic Calculi. In the old catalogue there is no description of the individual calculi, but merely a brief account of the chief varieties and the number of them present. There is, however, in the museum a set of plates with printed proofs, as well as the- original drawings, prepared by William Hunter with a view to a work on calculi which he had projected, but which never reached publication. A number of calculi were identified with the figures on those plates ; these are indicated throughout Series 52 and 53- by an asterisk placed before the number. The plate and figure are stated in parentheses at the end of the description as " Hunterian Plate, fig. â€”." In addition, a few notes (for the most part in William Hunter's handwriting) were found, either in the boxes with the calculi or among the numerous prints and sketches in the museum, which it was possible to identify with certain specimens. All these odd fragments of information have been incorporated with the new catalogue. No MS. of the projected work on calculi was found. Where the history of a specimen was found, it is quoted; where none is given, it is to be understood that none is known. The classification used agrees in the main points with that of the Catalogue of the Calculi in the Museum of the Eoyal College of

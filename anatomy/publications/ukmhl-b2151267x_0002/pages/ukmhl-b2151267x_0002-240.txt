622 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. IV. Tumours of the Female Genital Organs. (a) Innocent Tumours of the Uterus, Vagina, and Vulva. 45.26. Adenoma of the Uterus. Hunterian. CC. 70b. " Uterus and vagina slit open : a tubercle attached by a small peduncle, is seen in the fundus of the uterus like a small garden bean; several very small ones are also seen in the cervix." Sections of the large one show a structure consisting of loose fibrous tissue with a few simple cystsâ€”a simple adenoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 121.) 4-5.27. Adenoma of the Uterus. Eunierian. CC. 72. " Uterus slit open : a polypus with a pretty broad neck appears in the substance of the fundus, with a black bristle tied round it; the polypus is not larger than the end of one's finger." On microscopic examination it is found to be a simple adenoma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 122.) 45.28. Adenoma of the Uterus. Hwiterian. CC. 70. Uterus slit open, showing a very small tumour similar to the preceding, hanging in the middle of the back of the fundus. 45.29. Mucous Polypi (Adenomata) of the Uterus. Hunterian. CC. 73. Uterus slit open, showing two tumours of considerable size, similar to the preceding. The larger one projects from the left side of the cavity just below the orifice of the Fallopian tube; it measures about 25 by 15 by 8 mm. It is cystic; the contents are grumous. Microscopically it consists of very loose fibrous tissue with cyst-like spaces, which have not now any epithelia lining; it is much altered by time ; probably, however, it is of the same nature as the preceding, but with a certain amount of mucous degeneration. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 139.)

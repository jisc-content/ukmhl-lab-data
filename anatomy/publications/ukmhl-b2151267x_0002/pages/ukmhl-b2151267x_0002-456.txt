The vertical glass rod hanging close to the liver marks the umbilical artery, which in this case is the direct continuation of the aorta. The horizontal glass rod marks the umbilical vein, which runs from the left in the line of junction of skin and membrane to the longitudinal fissure of the liver. {d) Various Single Monstrosities not inclusihle in the preceding Glasses. 50.120. Congenitally Imperforate Urethra. Human. Hunterian. MM. 34. " A child at birth, injected red: the bladder was dilated to an enormous size and full of water, as if there had been an ascites; it had encroached exceedingly on the cavity of the chest." The urethra is imperforate somewhere about the bulb. The anus is pervious. 50.121. Enormous Congenital Cysts of the Neck. Hunterian. MM. 45. " A prodigiously deformed child, with its head and chest buried, as it were, in a large irregular mass of flesh." The so-called "mass of flesh" has at one time been laid open down both sides, and carefully sewn up again. It consists of two large cysts, one on each side. Between them lies the cranium. There is very marked retroflexion associated with a small eventration. The head is bent back so that the occiput lies well down between the shoulders, and the vertebral column is much shortened. The cranium is of large size, and was filled by a large well-shaped brain. The sutures of the vault are all membranous. The spinal cord enters the cranium unusually far back, and the medulla and portion of cord within it are unusually long. There is no trace of spina bifida. The cysts are partially divided into loculi by incomplete parti- tions. They extend from the top of the head down both sides to the border of the last rib. They occupy the whole breadth of the sides of the head and neck; they encroach very little on the back

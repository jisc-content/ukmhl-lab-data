The atrophy of the kidney sub- stance has gone much further in the shrunk kidney, which is reduced to a congeries of cysts opening into the dilated pelvis. The orifices of the ureters are patent. The obstruction must there- fore have been in the prostate gland or urethra. 41.7. Hydronephrosis. â€” One half of a large hydronephrosis. Prepared by distending the ureter, pelvis, and kidney with spirit, and removing one side after it became hard. Shows the ureter and pelvis greatly distended, the renal vessels stretched out over it, and the kidney itself reduced to a loculated cyst, with walls no more than 5 mm. thick, con- sisting of the fibrous capsule and remains of the renal cortex. The pyramidal substance has been completely destroyed. Renal Calculi and Concretions. 41.8. "Calcareous" Deposit in the Uriniferous Tubules. Htinterian. X. 94. " A portion of kidney, where the tubuli uriniferi contain cal- careous earth. Presumed to be the beginning of stone in the kidney." The deposit is seen as some indistinct white streaks in the pyramids of the medulla. 41.9. Crystalline Deposit in the Uriniferous Tubules. Huuterian. X. 96. " Two halves of a kidney where calcareous earth is seen in many places blocking up the extremities of the tubuli uriniferi." The deposits are indicated by bristles ; they appear as radiating clumps of yellowish streaks in the points of the pyramids. They are crystalline masses of phosphates. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 128.) 41.10. Minute Calculi in the Kidney. Hunterian. X. 97b. " A kidney laid open and hanging by the pelvis, to show vast

694 EUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 48.97. Injection of the Foetal Vessels, and also of the Intervillous Blood-spaces of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 98a. A portion of a similar placenta, in which there are seen also several of the uterine veins injected black. In the lobule cor- responding to these veins, the red injection of the foetal vessels is seen amidst the black of the maternal blood spaces. 48.98. Placenta Unravelled. Foetal Vessels. Hunterian. RR. 112. " A portion of placenta very highly injected and unravelled, appearing to be a beautiful shag of vessels." Injected from the umbilical cord so as to fill the vessels of the highly developed foetal villi, which form the main mass of the placenta. 48.99. Uterine Veins and Maternal Blood-spaces (" Cells ") of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 100. " A small section of placenta, with part of the membranes : the cells of the placenta have been filled from the veins of the uterus, or vice versa; the cells are not very large; on the side which adhered to the uterus, the veins may be seen very distinctly." The upper part of the specimen shows a number of large plugs of injection, which have occupied large uterine veins underlying the decidua close to the placental area. The lower part is a portion of the placenta; the injection appears in granules of various sizes, occupying the maternal blood "cells" (intervillous spaces) of the placenta. The small size and regularity of the granules shows that they are not extravasated but occupy natural cavities. 48.100. Uterine Veins of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 101. A portion of a uterus " where the veins had been injected black," the placenta torn away showing the irregular plugs of injection in the orifices of the uterine veins. 48.101. Section of the Uterus and Edge of the Placenta. Hunterian. RR. 111. " A section of the uterus with the placenta adhering, showing difference of structure and comparative thickness of each: the

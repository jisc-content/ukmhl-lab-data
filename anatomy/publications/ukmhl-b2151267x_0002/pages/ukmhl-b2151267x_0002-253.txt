CARCINOMA OF THE UTERUS. 635 45.80. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. The other half of the preceding; not numbered. There is a very large mass of glands at the side of the cervix. Two coils of intestine adhere to the fundus. 45.81. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. One half of uterus, showing the cervix converted into a large solid-looking tumour. The whole organ has a pyramidal shape, the fundus being the apex. The base is 6-5 cm. wide. The glands alongside the cervix are greatly enlarged; the whole forms a mass which must have completely filled the pelvis. The posterior lip of the os is more affected than the anterior, being enormously thickened, and presenting a large ulcerated surface looking downwards. The tumour extends all round the cervix; the anterior lip is considerably thickened; in it at least the portis vaginalis is not replaced by tumour, and its lower surface is not ulcerated. Nowhere is there any extension to the vaginal wall. It is a carcinoma, consisting of large masses of polygonal cells, in which are occasionally seen bodies like the laminated capsules of an epithelioma. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 136.) 45.82. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. From Dr. Allen Thomson's Collection. The whole uterus, with the posterior part of the vulva and vagina, and a small piece of the bladder, with bristles in the ureters, showing a tumour of the cervix, which, in contrast to the preceding, has grown out into long ragged polypoid masses projecting even beyond the vulva. The tissue is so much degen- erated that the carcinomatous nature of the growth can only be conjectured from the arrangement of the fibrous tissue, and from its naked-eye characters. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 13.5.) 45.83. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. CO. 67c. The cervical portion of the uterus described as No. 45.30. The cervix is enlarged, and its tissues are replaced by malignant growth. The cavity is enlarged and ragged, but the os still preserves its II. Q

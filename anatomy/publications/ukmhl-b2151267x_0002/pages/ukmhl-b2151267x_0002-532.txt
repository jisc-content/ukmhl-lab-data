914 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. amount of that substance. The calculi of the first two specimens are small, of irregularly rounded shajie, hard, but brittle and rather friable, of dirty white colour, and having a peculiar rough surface like that of a piece of wet clay which has been rolled with the fingers and then dried. All the calculi give the murexide test and evolve abundance of ammonia on addition of caustic potash. The two first burn quietly. The others, which are all very dense, hard, and brittle, decrepitate more or less violently on heating, a property supposed to be due to the separation of the ammonia from the uric acid in the midst of the hard substance. No attempt was made to determine the relative proportions of the urate of ammonium, other urates, and uric acid. 53.77. Urate of Ammonium Calculi. Hunierian. A number of the small earthy calculi which are said to be found only in the bladders of new-born and nursing infants, their history unfortunately not known. They are about the size of large peas. See the introductory paragraph for description. 53.78. Urate of Ammonium Calculi. Hunterian. A number of calculi similar to the preceding, but much smaller. 53.79. Urate of Ammonium Calculus. Hunierian. An oval calculus about the size of a filbert. It is formed through- out of very fine laminae, from dirty white to very pale brown in colour, very compact and hard and brittle. Its exterior is pale brown and nearly smooth. It gives the murexide reaction, evolves a large amount of ammonia on treatment with caustic potash, and decrepitates sharply before the blowpipe. It consists of a large amount of urate of ammonium mixed probably with other urates and uric acid, the relative proportions of which were not determined, 53.80. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium. Hunterian. Half of a calculus rather larger than the preceding. Its centre is a small stone exactly like the preceding, giving strong reaction, of

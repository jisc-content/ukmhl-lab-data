596 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. the tumour consists of soft tissue with well-defined nodules of very cellular cartilage, which are enclosed in distinct fibrous capsules, embedded in it. The soft tissue in the neighbourhood of the cartilaginous nodules is, for the most part, in a state of necrosis. So far as can be made out, it has consisted of masses of cells in a well-defined alveolar stroma, the general appearance suggesting carcinoma. Near the surface of the testicle the tissue is fairly well preserved : there it consists of masses of large polygonal epithelial cells, lying in the meshes of a rather scanty fibrous stroma; clearly carcinoma.

It is ten times the natural size, soft and pulpy; gave but little pain; was extirpated; patient seemed to recover, but died some months after of other scrophulous sores." It presents a homogeneous fleshy section, is smooth externally, and in microscopic structure is a very cellular carcinoma. The epididymis is included in the tumour. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 104.)

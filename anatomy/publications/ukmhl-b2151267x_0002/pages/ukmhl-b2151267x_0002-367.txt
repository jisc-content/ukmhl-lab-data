COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE PLACENTA. 749 tissue, bearing rich plexuses of red and blue vessels. The injection being comparatively coarse, only the larger vessels are injected. It conveys an exceedingly good idea of how the maternal and foetal circulations are brought into the intimate relationship necessary for the interchanges that take place between them. 48.249. Placentula of Sheep and Corpus Luteum. Hmiterian. A small portion, probably of the same uterus, with one cotyledon partly dissected, showing the uterine vessels below it and some of the villi. Also the Fallopian tube and ovary. The latter is split open, showing a corpus luteum occupying nearly the whole of the organ. Coarsely injected blue and red. 48.250. Uterus showing Polycotyledonary Placentation. Hunterian. EE. 327. " Two horns of the uterus laid open; showing a prodigious number of cotyledons of different sizes; the ovarium laid open exhibits sections of two corpora lutea, very much resembling the corpora lutea in the human subject." Species of animal unknown. The foetal parts of the cotyledons have been removed with the membranes, leaving the maternal parts as flat buttons deeply and closely pitted on the free surface. Somewhat like that of the cow. 48.251. Uterus showing Polycotyledonary Placentation. Htmiericm. (Not described.) An uterus divided into two cornua, distinct right down to the os externum; slit open and the membranes removed showing very numerous cotyledons from which the foetal structures have not been detached. 48.252. Amnion containing Foetal Calf. Hunierian. EE. 344. "Amnion containing a young calf; at the lower part is a globule of mercury to sink the preparation." There are no blood vessels in the amnion.

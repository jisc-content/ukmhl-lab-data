HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 874 52.57. Cast of Human Hair Ball from the Stomach. Dr. Paterson, Glasgow, Described as a " Cast of a mass of human hair found in a lady's stomach." Its shape is roughly that of the cavity of the stomach when moderately distended. The lesser curvature is small, so that the parts corresponding to pylorus and cardia are close to one another. It measures in straight lines 16'5 cm. from the cardiac to- the pyloric end, 15 cm. from the highest point of the cardiac end to the lowest point of the greater curvature, and 6 cm. from back to- front at its thickest part. It must have filled the stomach verj^ completely. 52.58. Coated Hair Ball. Hunterian..

917 CALCIUM OXALATE CALCULI. 53.88. Calculus of Urate of Ammonium coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. A small calculus consisting of a stone exactly like No. 53.79, enclosed in several distinct tliin shells of mixed phosphates. 53.89. Calculus consisting largely of Urate of Ammonium coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. A calculus about the size of a pigeon's egg, consisting of a centre of pale whitey-brown matter, largely urate of ammonium, enclosed in a shell of phosphates divided into several layers by thin laminae of calcium oxalate. 53.90. Calculus of Urate of Ammonium coated with Phosphates. Hunterian. A calculus consisting of a stone similar to No. 53.88, but smaller, and having outside the layer of phosphates a shell of very hard white material which is not combustible nor fusible, and effervesces freely with cold hydrochloric acidâ€”apparently calcium carbonate. SECTION III. Calculi consisting principally of Calcium Oxalate. There are 45 specimens of this species of calculus in the museum. Very few of these are pure calcium oxalate, but in most it is the calcium oxalate part which gives character to the stone. One of the specimens consists of several small hard white smooth stones, a rare form of calcium oxalate calculus. In the rest the calcium oxalate portion is of round or oval shape, and has a very rough irregular surface covered with prongs and nodules (mulberry calculi). In colour they are of various shades of brown. From their roughness they cause much irritation in the bladder, and frequently bleeding, and therefore are often coated with blood-stained organic matter ; one specimen in the collection illustrates this feature very strikingly (No. 53.96). Many of the calculi have a layer of uric acid round the oxalate stone, filling up its irregularities more or less; in these stones the surface may be quite smooth. The commonest form of nucleus is a small hard brittle stone of pale yellow colour, containing

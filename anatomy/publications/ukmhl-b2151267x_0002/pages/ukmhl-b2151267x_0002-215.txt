Diverging from this below are two folds of skin—the labia majora; and between them two smaller folds of mucous membrane—the labia minora. At the junction of the labia minora in front is seen the point of the erectile organ or clitoris, covered by a hood-like fold of mucous membrane called its prepuce. Below this, in the middle line, is the orifice of the urethra set on a small raised tubercle. The labia majora terminate behind in a thin edge round the posterior border of the vagina, which is called the fourchette. Internal to this is a thin fold of mucous membrane continuous with the labia minora. The orifice of the vagina is covered by the hymen, which is perfect; its opening is a mere slit about half an inch long—a rather unusual form. The anus

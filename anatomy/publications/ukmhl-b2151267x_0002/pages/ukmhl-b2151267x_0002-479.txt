The two portions of a similar but much smaller calculus. It has a small dark centre of bilirubin calcium. Sinks rapidly in water. *52.7. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. Portion of a very beautiful calculus, of oval shape, 2-5 by 1'7 cm., of clear translucent crystalline cholesterine, with hardly a trace of pigmentary matter. It has been broken instead of cut, which shows its structure better. Sinks rapidly in water. {Hunterian Plate I., fig. 9.) *52.8. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. Half of a similar but larger stone, 2-8 by 2 cm.; the translucency of the central parts is lessened by the presence of a little biliary colour- ing matter among the cholesterine crystals. " This concretion was taken out of the gall bladder of Dr. Robt. Taylor, and given to me by Sir Edward Wilmot, 1762. The surface was pretty smooth, yet had some fiat and unequal granulations. Its colour pale and transparent, with a little of a greenish tint. When cut through, as in this figure, it was all of the same kind, viz., pale and trans- parent (but most so in the outer half of each radius); not laminated, but made of crystals like spermaceti, shooting from the centre to the circumference. There were some empty interstices in the inner half. Sank in water even when dry." (Does so still.) {Hunterian Plate I., fig. 8.) 52.9. Crystalline Cholesterine Gall Stone. Hunterian. Portion of a similar stone, broken, showing the whitish glancing crystallizations. Sinks in water. " John Bryson's stone, which was thrown up by vomiting several years ago. He hath had very good health since. Before he threw it up he had been soundlj^ drubbed and frightened out of his wits. 1741. Mr. Muir of Glasgow."

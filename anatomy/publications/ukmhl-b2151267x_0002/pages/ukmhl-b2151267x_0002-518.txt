900 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 53.8. Uric Acid Calculus. Hmderian. A very large concretion of oval shape, flattened (as is usually the case) in one direction, broken into fragments. About one half has been pieced together again. Measured 10 by 7 by 4'3 cm., and consists of pure uric acid, in fine laminae and very dense. Its exterior is finely tuberculated. There are one or two dark patches on the exterior which consist of oxalate of lime. 53.9. Uric Acid Calculus. Hnnterian. A calculus rather smaller than a hen's egg, of a pale buff colour. Pure uric acid throughout. 53.10. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunferian. A similar calculus, uncut, but broken at one end. Very smooth externally and very hard. 53.11. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a calculus about the size of a hen's egg, of fair oval shape, cut. It is formed in fine laminae of various shades of brown; very dense and hard. 53.12. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A flattened oval calculus about the size of a pigeon's egg. Finely tuberculated externally. Of rich ruddy brown colour. 53.13. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A pale brown calculus similar in shape to the preceding, but slightly larger, cut. 53.14. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A flat concretion of roughly triangular outline, composed of pale cinnamon-brown uric acid, for the most part deposited in granular form. Very soft for a uric acid stone. About the same size as the preceding, cut.

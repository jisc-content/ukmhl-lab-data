905 URIC ACID CALCULI. 53.37. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a calculus about the size of a duck's egg, composed, like the preceding, of a large centre of granular uric acid, surrounded by alternating layers of dense laminated and granular uric acid mixed with a considerable amount of calcium oxalate. Exterior tuberculated. 53.38. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a calculus about the same size as the preceding. The central parts are of rather soft uric acid with a tendency to the granular formation; the outer part consists of very fine wavy laminae. The central parts show a trace, and the outer a considerable amount, of calcium oxalate. Exterior tuberculated. *53.39. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus considerably smaller than the preceding, of flattened oval shape, bulging considerably on one side, cut. The peculiar shape is due to its having two nucleiâ€”a large one, a mass of granular uric acid about 3 by 1'5 cm., and a small one of the same structure applied to the middle of one of the long sides of the large one. They are separated by a layer of dense material, and the outer parts of the calculus are made up of a layer, about 1 cm. thick all round, of laminae of various degrees of compactness. It consists throughout of uric acid with a distinct trace of calcium oxalate. The exterior nearly smooth. {Hunterian Plate XVIII., fig. 7.) 53.40. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus about the same size as the preceding. It has a centre of laminated dense uric acid, a granular layer which shows traces of oxalates, and, externally to that, a broad zone of very dense finely laminated uric acid, nearly pure. Rough excrescences like the points of a calcium oxalate stone project here and there, but they are, nevertheless, uric acid. *53.41. Uric Acid Calculus. Hunterian. This specimen appears to be a fragment of a lai'ge stone which has been left in the bladder, and has received a fine coating of calculous

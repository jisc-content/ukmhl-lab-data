825 SINGLE MONSTERS. 50. 91. Hemicrania. Human. Himterian. MM. 10. (Nosencephale.) A similar head uninjected. "On the top of the head, uncovered by the common integuments, is an irregular fungous-looking substance, presumed to be a degeneration of brain: this substance is generally very vascular." A slice of the tumour has been cut away on the right side, laying open several small cysts, surrounded by tissue vi^hich closely resembles that of the corpora cavernosa penis ; these tumours, in part at least, are of the nature of angiomata. 50.92. Hemicrania. Human. Eunierian. MM. 12. (Nosencephale.) "The superior half of a child similar to No. 10 {MM. 10â€”the preceding), minutely injected red." The vascular tumour, in its irregularly-lobed shape and bright red colour, resembles the wattles on the neck of a turkey cock. The former catalogue says, " The fungus on the head exceedingly vascular as if it were pia mater collapsed, now that the brain was gone; the thorax opened ; heart and lungs very perfect," 50. 93. Hemicrania. Human. Hun ferian. MM. 7. (Nosencephale.) A similar head, but not injected. " Everything .above the eyes, that is, all the cranium, wanting," except the occipital region and base. "There is also a double harelip, large staring eyes, and something like remains of brain on the top of the head, but uncovered by the common integuments." 50.94. Hemicrania. Human. Hunterian. MM. 13. (Nosencephale.) Head of a foetus injected red, showing a condition very similar to the preceding. The skull above the eyes is as flat as in anencephalia; but, instead of the vault being absent and the base bare, the vault seems to have developed imperfectly, leaving a gap in the centre, around which it has collapsed upon the base. The gap, an area about 4 cm. in diameter, is occupied by a small vascular tumour similar to those seen in the preceding specimens. The rest of the top of the head all round it is covered with skin.

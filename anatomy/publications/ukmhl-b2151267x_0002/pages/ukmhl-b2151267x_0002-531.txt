CALCULI OF URIC ACID AND URATES. 913 53.73. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunierian. A calculus of uric acid and traces of calcium oxalate, round a nucleus about the size of a hazel nut, of very pale brown colour, and containing much urate of ammonium. Some phosphates externally. 53.74. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urates and Phos- phates. Hunterian. A small flattened spherical calculus consisting of a uric acid nucleus, then numerous layers of uric acid and some calcium oxalate, dark brown in colour, and lastly a zone of pinkish softer material composed of urates and phosphates mixed. 53.75. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. A long oval calculus of considerable size consisting principally of uric acid, but evolving a small amount of ammonia from all its layers on addition of caustic potash. Its exterior to a large extent coated with dark brown organic matter. 53.76. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium and Phosphates. Hunterian. An oval calculus of uric acid with a thin external shell of pale pink material which is principally mixed phosphates, but gives a distinct murexide reaction. The exterior of the calculus is roughly tuberculated and of a dark reddish-brown colour. SUCTION II Calculi consisting principally of Urate of Ammonium. In this section of the series have been placed fourteen specimens, the first two of which are each a number of the typical small urate of ammonium calculi of primary formation ; the other eight are large calculi containing other matters besides urate of ammonium, but having peculiar characters which are due to the presence of a large

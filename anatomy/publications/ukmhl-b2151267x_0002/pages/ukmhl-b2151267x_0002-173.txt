555 THE TUBULES OF THE TESTICLE. 42.38. The Lobulation of the Testicle. Htmterian. Y. 22. "The body of the testicle, the albuginea turned up all round. The tubuli exceedingly convoluted are seen in separate parcels." 42.39. The Tubules of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 23. A similar preparation with the tubules, " a little unravelled by maceration in water." 42.40. The Tubules of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 25. Similar to the preceding ; a little more unravelled. 42.41. The Tubules of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 26. A similar preparation beautifully unravelled, the tubules, though still convoluted, hanging for a length of fully 20 cm. They are rather thicker than human hair. 42.42. The Tubules of the Testicle injected with Mercury. Hunterian. Y. 2%. "An exceedingly beautiful and complete injection of the tubuli testis, epididymis and vas deferens (injected 1778); there is a small quantity of acid in the spirit to make the mercury appear more bright, the spirit otherwise renders the tubes blackish: some of the tubes are drawn out one inch and a half: epididymis and vas deferens are loose and disposed in a waving line over the testis: a few of the tubes are unfilled, but these taken together are not above one-tenth of the whole : and what was very remark- able, one side of the albuginea had been removed before the mercury had entered the testis, so that the injector saw the whole tubes filled in about a quarter of an hour." The process of pre- paration consisted in squeezing the testicle and epididymis and stripping the vas deferens till as much as possible of the fluid contents had been removed, then inserting a pipe into the vas deferens and allowing the mercury to flow in by gravitation, no .great pressure being required.

778 HUNT BRIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. till the placenta was formed. William Hunter's opinion was as follows: " There are two things at the time of labour which I am frightened at (all the others I don't care a sixpence for); one is a flooding, and the other convulsions. Flooding, when the woman is not in labour, or in the time when it is not over, is a very alarming symptom, as it indicates a very considerable separation, and there is no chance of its being worn olf till the uterus is emptied. It generally proceeds from the placenta adhering too near the os tincae, and in such case I think it is always of great weight to hasten the delivery by breaking the membranes and trying to bring it away by the feet." {Midinfery Lectures, MS. R.C.S.Eng., 42, c. 31.) This specimen closely resembles, and probably is the original of the lower part of PI. XII. of the G-ravid Uterus, which was taken from the uterus of a woman " who died of a flooding in the ninth month of pregnancy." The placenta is not attached right over the OS, but chiefly on the anterior wall, overlapping the os only a few centimetresâ€”a position decidedly favourable to success in introducing the fingers to turn and bring down the foot.

912 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 53.68. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium, Hunterian. A small spherical stone of uric acid and traces of calcium oxalate in very fine laminae, very hard and dense. The nucleus and one or two of the laminae, which are much paler than the rest of the stone, contain urate of ammonium. 53.69. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. A small oval stone of uric acid and a trace of calcium oxalate in fine laminae, with a nucleus of paler material which is largely urate of ammonium. 53.70. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. A small stone of very irregular shape, probably renal; its sub- stance is of very loose texture, being formed in laminae which are very irregular. It consists of uric acid with much organic matter, which burns with yellow flame and smell of burnt feathers —probably fibrin and mucus. It also evolves some ammonia on addition of hydrochloric acid from the presence in it of some urate of ammonium. Burns away completely. 53.71. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. Half of a very much flattened oval stone of considerable size, consisting of uric acid—partly granular, partly laminated—round a pale nucleus which contains some urate of ammonium. Tuberculated externally. 53.72. Calculus of Uric Acid and some Urate of Am- monium. Hunterian. Half of a similar stone, which has a good deal of calcium oxalate in most of its layers, and is coarsely tuberculated externally. The centre is a nucleus of pale matter containing much urate of ammonium, enclosed in a sharply defined thin shell of dark brown calcium oxalate.

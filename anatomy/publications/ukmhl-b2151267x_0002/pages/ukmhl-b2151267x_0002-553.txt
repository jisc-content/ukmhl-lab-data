935 CALCIUM CARBONATE CALCULI. 53.168. Triple Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. Half of a flattened oval calculus about the size of a pigeon's egg, built up of concentric laminae of crystalline triple phosphates. The crj'stals both on the exterior, Avhich is rough, and in the section are of a waxy white colour, rather like a pure cholesterine gall stone {vide Series 52). It is very soft. Before the blowpipe it burns away, without melting, to a considerable extent, and the residue fuses readily. By other tests it is found to be principally triple phosphates. History unknown, perhaps not urinary. 53.169. Triple Phosphate Calculus. Hunterian. A calculus of rounded tetrahedral form, built up of a number of well-defined laminae of phosphates nearly all triple, but readily fusible from the presence of some of the earthy phosphates, round a small compact nucleus of ammonium urate. SECTION ri Calcium Carbonate Calculi. Of this kind of calculus there are six specimens in the collection, all from the lower animals. Calculi of calcium carbonate alone are seldom found in man, but it appears as an ingredient of some urinary calculi, and of prostatic, salivary, pancreatic, and some biliary calculi. They are recognized by the property of dissolving completely or in great part in acids with effervescence. Before the blowpipe they blacken from combustion of their organic parts, and leave a large white ash of quicklime which is not fusible. 53.170. Calculus of Calcium Carbonate and some Phos- phates. Hunterian (1). "Part of a stone taken out of the bladder of a horse when dead.. Ex dono D. Phillips, M.D." It has been a very large stone of oval shape, considerably larger than a goose's egg. The central parts are made up of coarse granules closely agglutinated together. They consist of calcium carbonate, some phosphates, and much organic matter; no uric acid. Round this is a thick shell of very densfr

605 THE UTERUS AND ITS APPENDAGES. the boundary between them. The cavity of the cervix is oblong, and its mucous membrane is thrown into regular rugae, called the arbor vitae uterinus. The cavity of the body is triangular in shape. See succeeding specimens. 44.29. The Uterus and its Appendages. Hunterian. CC. 28. An uterus and its appendages cut off a little above the level of the OS internum, and hung by the right ovary and Fallopian tube. " The preparation hangs side ways by the right Fallopian tube, near its fimbria. The cavity of the uterus in this view is not half an inch long, and is merely a line in breadth, but not a straight line, making a portion of a circle; the Fallopian tube makes the upper edge of the broad ligament, the ovarium is behind in that ligament, and the round ligament is before; the fimbriae of the external orifice of the Fallopian tube are continued down half an inch to the body of ovarium, and form as it were a fringed chain of connection." The ovary is of rounded shape, and wrinkled externally. Note also the round ligament of the ovary attaching it to the uterus. 44.30. The Vagina, Uterus, and Appendages of a Virgin. From behind. Hunterian. CC. 29. The vagina, uterus and appendages, and rectum of a virgin laid open; " the cervix uteri is the principal object; the rugae in it resemble the long leaves of rushes from a middle stem; the cervix is much longer than the fundus ; both taken together are not above two inches in length, the breadth is about one inch at the very uppermost part of fundus : there are bristles in the interior orifices of the Fallopian tubes," and in the fimbriated extremity of the right. The tubes are thrown forward so as to display the ovaries. The vagina is typically virgin, being exceedingly rugose, and pre- senting near its orifice a very well marked hymen. Compare specimens Nos. 44.1-44.13. 44.31. The Cavity of the Cervix Uteri. Hunterian. CC. 29a. The above laid open. The rugae peunatae exceedingly beautiful.

592 HUNTERIAN ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 43. 51. Epididymitis. Hunterian. Y. 70d. Similar to the preceding. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 107.) 43.52. Chancres of the Glans Penis. Hunterian. BB. 45. The anterior half of the "penis of a Jew; as the prepuce is removed it explains circumcision : there are also two large chancres on the glaus. (Solomon Porter.)" The "chancres" are a rather superficial ulceration on the point of the glans around the urethra, and a second rather deeper ulcer, with sharply defined edges, on the dorsum of the glans. Probably soft chancres. The organ is rather overdistended with red injection. 43.53. Tubercular Ulceration of the Bladder. Hunterian. CC. 39. The anterior parts of the uterus and vagina with part of the posterior wall of the bladder, showing " A sloughing disposition in the inner surface of the bladder. Case not known." There are a number of small irregular rounded raised yellowish patches on the mucous membrane in the neighbourhood of the orifices of the ureters. The area between the ureters is also occupied by what seems to be an ulcerated surface very similar in appearance to the patches, but not raised. The orifices themselves are unaffected. On microscopic examination, the condition is found to be one of tubercular disease of the bladder. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 133.) 43.54. Tuberculosis of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 68. " A scirrhous testicle" cut open, presenting an almost uniform fleshy substance without trace of tubules. On microscopic examina- tion it was found to be tubercular; a good deal of it has undergone caseation, but not softening. The epididymis is somewhat enlarged, being apparently also involved. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 103.) 43.55. Tuberculosis of the Testicle. Hunterian. Y. 70b. A testicle slightly enlarged, " apparently of the scrophulous kind," " but little advanced." There are numerous tubercles of small size scattered among the tubules. The epididymis somewhat enlarged also. (MS. Notes, J.H.T., p. 105.)

THE EFFECTS OF GASTRIC DIGESTION. 433 33.43. Stomach, Froventriculus and Gizzard, of a Large Bird. — (Source unknown. Jar marked No. 56.) The muscular coat of the first part of the proventriculus is dissected off to show the gastric glands as in Nos. 35-37. It opens into the upper part of the gizzard, and about 5 cm. from it arises the intestine also from the upper part. The two great muscular masses pre- sent externally a pair of tendinous expansions which converge at either end into a thick strong tendon which holds them together. The Effects of Digestion. 33. 44. The Effects of Digestion on Teeth and Bone. Hunterian. 0. i\a. " Some teeth and other bones, with a ball of hair, found in the stomach of a leopard that died in the Tower (Tower of London). The bones are half dissolved; the teeth were as soft as a camel hair pencil, and would have answered most purposes nearly as well. The ball of hair shows the twisting of the fibres by the stomach in its peristaltic action like the vortex of a whirlpool." Compare Series 53, section Animal Hair Balls. The teeth have been decalcified by the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice. 33.45. Post-mortem Digestion of the Stomach. Hunterian. 0. 50a.

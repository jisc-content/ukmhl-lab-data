TEE TESTICLE AND EPIDIDYMIS. 557 42.48. Testicle injected with Mercury by the Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 34. Similar to the preceding. Dried and mounted in turpentine. 42.49. Testicle injected with Mercury by the Vas Deferens. Hunterian. Y. 35. A beautiful example of the same kind of preparation, mounted in turpentine on red paper. The epididymis is unravelled to a con- siderable extent. The vasa efferentia and coni vasculosi are well displayed. There are about a dozen of the former arranged in four bundles. 42.50. Testicle injected with Mercury. Vasa Efferentia. Hunterian. Y, 36. Similar to the preceding, on brown paper ; in turpentine ; the vasa efferentia to the number of twelve finely unravelled. 42.51. Testicle injected with Mercury. Vasa Efferentia. Hunterian. Y. 38. Similar to the preceding. In turpentine, on white paper. 42.52. Testicle injected with Mercury. Vas Aberrans of the Epididymis. Hunterian. Y. 40. Similar to the preceding, but with the epididymis " very much unravelled appearing like a single tube convoluted. One of the vascula aberrantia of Haller is seen terminating near the beginning of the vas deferens." The vas aberrans is a convoluted tube similar to the vas deferens in structure, and like it formed from the Wolffian duct of the foetus. On " blue" (now black) paper in turpentine. 42.53. Vas Aberrans of the Epididymis. Hunterian. Y. 46. A testicle partly injected with mercury, the epididymis not unravelled, showing the above in its natural position rising from the epididymis near to its lower end and passing up beside the vas deferens. Turpentine.

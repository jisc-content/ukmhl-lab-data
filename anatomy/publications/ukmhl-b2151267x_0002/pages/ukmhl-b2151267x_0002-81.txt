COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE INTESTINES. 463 35.91. The Duodenum of the Horse. The Bile and Pan- creatic Ducts. Hunterian. P. 50a. "The duodenum of the horse, slit open to show the entrance of the biliary and pancreatic ducts ; one of the pancreatic ducts enters with the biliary duct, and both open by distinct mouths ! into a kind of sacculus or large follicle, which may serve for a sort of gall-bladder in this animal, who has none in the usual place; the other pancreatic duct opens about two or three inches further down than the first. Bougies are in all these ducts, and project into the sacculus or intestine." 35.92. The Ileum of the Horse. The Agminated Lym- phatic Follicles. Hunterian. G. 16. 35.93.

The villi are very distinct: " are most of them like the human; some are long and resemble those of the dog." 35.96. The Small Intestine of the Turtle. Hunterian. P. I2a. A small portion of the above, laid open, injected red, the injection prevented from entering the upper part by a ligature. The mucous membrane is thrown into fine longitudinal folds, which appear to take the place of villi.

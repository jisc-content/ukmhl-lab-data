THE MUSCULAR WALL OF THE UTERUS. 669 to be a section of the same uterus as the preceding, higher up and including the appendages. The dimensions are very similar, but the cavity is flatter from back to front. The areolar tissue between the two sides of the broad ligaments is spread out with bristles. 48.17. Longitudinal Section of the Wall of the Gravid Uterus after Delivery. Hunterian. BR. 9. A longitudinal slice, about 6 mm. thick, out of the wall of a recently emptied gravid uterus, thickened by having contracted, and probably also by the vessels having been injected. See under No. 48.15. The section has traversed the site of the placenta. Internally it is ragged from the remains of that structure, and the inner two-thirds of the total thickness are honeycombed with the blood-vessels which ran to and from it. The outer third and the peritoneal layer have far fewer vessels. The total thickness is fully two inches (5 cm.); the round of the jar makes it appear much greater. 48.18. Muscular Fibres of the Uterus. Hunterian. IIR. 10. " Uterus much contracted after delivery, boiled and unravelled to show its muscular fibres." 48.19. Muscular Fibres of the Uterus. Hunterian. RR. 177. "A small portion of the uterus, injected red, showing distinctly muscular fibres." 48.20. Arrangement of the Internal Muscular Fibres around the Orifices of the Fallopian Tubes. Hunterian. RR. 11. "Two portions of the uterus at birth, in the centre of which are seen the orifices of the Fallopian tubes coming into the cavity of uterus, and round these orifices for four or five inches are seen the muscular fibres in packets forming vortices or concentric circles." (Old catalogue.) " I have taken considerable pains to trace the arrangement of the uterine fasciculi, but, except upon

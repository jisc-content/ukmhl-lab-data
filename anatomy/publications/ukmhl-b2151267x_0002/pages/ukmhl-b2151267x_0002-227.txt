THE MAMMARY GLANDS. 609 44-. 47. Section of Mammary Gland during Lactation. Eimferian. DD. 3. The section traverses the centre of the organ and includes the nipple, the point of which is cut off to show the lactiferous ducts. The quantity of gland tissue is enormous compared with that in the preceding specimens. The pigmented areola round the nipple is well marked. 44.48. Pigmentation of the Nipple in Pregnancy. Hunter km. DD. 4. "The central portion of the mamma from a pregnant woman; the areola is of a dark brown, except where cuticle and rete mucosum have been removed; there it is a perfect white, and shows the blackness depended on rete mucosum." 44.49. The Lactiferous Ducts. Hunterian. DD. 5. " A portion of the mamma in which the tubuli lactiferi are filled with red corroding injection; their diameters near the nipple are larger than those of crow quills." The injection seems to have penetrated to the acini of the gland. 44.50. The Lactiferous Ducts. Eimterian. DD. 6. Portion of a mamma, showing the above injected with mercuiy. Dried and mounted in turpentine. 44.51. The Lactiferous Ducts and Acini of the Mammary Gland. Hmiterian. CO. 9. "A most beautiful injection of about one-fourth of the mamma from a woman (B.H.), who died just after delivery. The tubuli are filled with mercury, but not seen distinctly, on account of the vast number of follicles, and that the preparation which was removed out of spirits of wine into turpentine, is not yet perfectly dried." Still obscure (1896), but a beautiful preparation, the mercury having entered the ultimate acini of the gland.

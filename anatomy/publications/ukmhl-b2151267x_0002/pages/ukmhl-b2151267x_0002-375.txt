Hunterian. BR. 91. "An ovum where the^e had been twins; one child only remains, apparently near the full time, but blasted and shrunk." There is one large placenta, which on careful examination can be seen to consist of two placentae corresponding to the two foetuses. The line of junc- tion is indistinct, but the two are quite distinguishable, because, whereas that of the blighted foetus is firm and solid, that of the other presents the normal spongy lobulated appearance. There are two distinct amniotic sacs, and two umbilical cords; that of the blighted foetus is so thin and so tightly twisted, that, latterly at least, it was probably functionless. The stump of the other is normal. Another case of twins is described under No. 48.78. (6) Extrauterine Gestation. 49.2. Tubal Pregnancy. Rupture. Formation of Decidua in Uterus. Hunterian. ER. 367. "An uterus where there had been an ovum in one of the Fallopian tubes; the Fallopian tube is distended to nearly the size of a hen's egg, and has been ruptured; the ovum probably passing out into the cavity of the belly : what is remarlvable is the increase of the uterus, as if it contained an ovum, and the presence in it of the decidua, which is clearly proved by this preparation to be formed by the uterus, and to be independent in some measure of the ovum. The foetus was found in a coagulum, and is preserved in the bottle marked RR. r291." (Now No. 48.160.) The conception has

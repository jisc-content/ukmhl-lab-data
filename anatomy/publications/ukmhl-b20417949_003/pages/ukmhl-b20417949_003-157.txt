219 THE TWO FIRST SPINAL NERVES. POSTERIOR DIVISION OF First Cervical Nerve (Suboccipital) - Larger than anterior. Emerges between oocipifeal bone & posterior arch of atlas just behind vertebral artery, enters triangle form3!l by small postor- ior cranio-vertebral muscles, supplies these muscle? & complexas, and joins with posterior division of 2nd cervical nerve. Sometimes gives off a small cutaneous branch, which branch, when it exists, accompanies occipital artery fco integument of lower & back part of occiput, and ioias with great & small occipital. Second Cervical Nerve - Three or four times as large as anterior division, and the largest of the posterior cervical nerves. Emerges between posterior arch of atlas & lamina of axis, supplies iufer- ior oblique, and after joining with, posterior division of 1st & 3rd cervical nerves, divides into: External Branch - Similar to external branches of six lower posterior cervical nerves, but somewhat larger, joins with corresponding branch of 3rd posterior cervical nerve, and supplies the same muscles, & also the complexaa. Internal Branch (Great Occipital Nerve) - Crosses triangle formed by posterior cranio-vertebral muscles, pierces complexas & trapezius, joins with small occipital & with ascending twig from internal branch of posterior division of 3rd, and supplies integumeat of back of head as far aa vertex; gives off an auricular branch to back of ear.

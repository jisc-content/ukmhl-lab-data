A septum groAvs backwards from the common anterior wall, but is not completed till after birth, a communication (foramen ovale) bemg left between the two auricles during the whole of foetal life. (3.) A septum extending backwards from the distal end of the aortic bulb now divides the bulb into an anteiior portion, or pidmonary artery^ which remains in con- nection with the right ventricle, and a posterior portion, or aorta troper, which remains similarly connected with the left ventricle. II. Aortic Arches. Much confusion has resulted, in the description of the aortic arches, from the lax use of terms. It will be endeavoured here to introduce some precision. It will further be attempted to make this difficult subject as comprehensible as it is susceptible of being made by stating the facts of the case, first in reference to the foetal structures, then in reference to the normal adult structures, and finally in reference to the abnormal adult structures most frequently met with. A portion of Section IV. is quoted from the admirable article on the subject in the last edition of Quain's " Anatomy." Tor the sake of clearness, the two primitive aortaj will be taken to consist of an ascending portion, or ascending root, of a descending portion, or descending root, and of ar; EXT.

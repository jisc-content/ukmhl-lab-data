204 FIFTH NERVE. Arises by two roots, anterior small or motor, posterior large or sensory, from side of pons Varolii nearer to upper than to lower border. Through opening in dura mater near apex of petrous portion of temporal bone. Sensory roofc i to Gasserian ganglion; motor root to iaferior maxillary nerve outside cranium. Gasserian gatnglion - Crescentic. Situated in a depression near apex of pe- trous portion of temporal bone, and receives filaments from carotid plex. Gives off Jinteriorly ophthalmic, superior & inferior maxillary nerves, and laterally, small branches to tentorium cerebelli & dura mater of middle ' fossa, and one to 6th nerve in cavernous sinus. OPHTHALMIC NERVE — The smallest of the three divisions of the 5th pair. Through outer wall of cavernous sinus below 3rd & 4th nerves, being joined by filaments from cavernous plexus and frequently from 4th nerve, and giving off recurrent branches to tentorium. Divides near sphenoidal fissure into lachrymal, frontal, nasaL LACHRYMAL N. — The smallest. Through outer & nai rowest part of sphenoidal fissure, and along upper border of exter- nal rectus to lachrymal gland, conjunctiva & skin of upper eyelid. — Joins with \ orbital branch of superior maxillary nerve, j FRONTAL N. — The largest. I Th rough highest & broadest part of sphenoidal fissure; I Along middle line of orbit between levator palpebrae superioris & periosteum, and divi- des into: \ SUPRAORBITAL BR. — The largest. Through supraorbital foramen or notch, S and ascends to corrugator supercilii, occipito-frontalis & orbicularis pal- pebrarum, and to periosteum & integument, the cutaneous branches, two in number, lying at first beneath the mupcles. ! SUPRATROCHLEAR BR. — The smallest. Above pulley of superior oblique, and same destribution. Joins with infratrochlear branch of nasaL I NASAL N.—Intermediate in size. Vide p. 207. ' !|

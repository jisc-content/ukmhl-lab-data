200 THE TASTE-BUDS. Are flask-like bodies discovered by Loven & Scbwalbe in the thick epithelial layer which surrounds the sides of the circumvallate papillae of the base of the tongue, and which have also been found of late on some of the fungiform papillae and on the epiglottis. They are pyriform in shape. Their bases rest upon the chorium. Their apices project between the superficial epithelial cells, and present a minute opening, from which a bundle of thread-like processes are seen to emerge. They consist of modified epithelial cells, disposed perpendicularly to the surface, which cells may Ibe divided into superficial & deep. The superficial cells are flattened, or ribbon-like, tapering at each end, and joined together at their sides, so as to enclose the deeper cells, as, i^ the flower-bud, the external scales surround the internal folioles. The deeper cells are spindle-l shaped, enlarged in their middle, where they present a prominent nucleus, and tapering at either- end. Their deeper end, which is sometimes branched, passes down into the chorium, and, it is said, becomes connected with a nerve-fibril. Their more superficial end is prolonged into one of the thread-like processes, which are seen to project from the opening of the taste-bud. The surrounding epithelial cells are flattened around the taste-buds, so as to enclose them in a sao or nest. The taste-buds are now believed not to be connected â– mth the sense of taste, since they are found on the epiglottis, which is not endowed with taste.

262 FOURTH AND FIFTH LAYERS.—General View. May be divided into: LONG EXTENSOR MUSCLES of the BACK — Lie beneath the trapezius, the latissnnus dorsi & the superficial layer of the lumbar fascia and beneath the splenius & a special layer of fascia in the neck, & the serrati muscles & the vertebral aponeurosis in the back. They form a large elongated muscular and tendinous mass, narrow & principally tendinous and comprised in the sacral groove, below; enlarged & fleshy in the lumbar region where it is only partly contained in the vertebral groove, and is tightly sheathed be tween the spines, ]amiii£B, & transverse processes of the vertebrae and the posterior <S middle layers of the lumbar fascia; expanded and complexly subdivided into almost in^ numerable muscular and tendinous fasciculi in the back; and, in the cervical region partly exhausted, but continued upwards towards the head by numerous superadded fibres, & also strengthened by an additional muscle, the complexus. The muscular & tendinous slips of which this mass is composed may be correctly and con veniently arranged into three main groups forming respectively the ilio-costalis o. sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, & the fimltifidus spina:; the two former of which joined together below, and increased by a few additional fibres, the spinalis dorsi form the ^'r^'<;/^?r spin(2 of the sacral & lumbar regions. (The term erector spina' vv'ould be much better applied to the whole of the long extensor muscles of the back thai to any one patr thereof). Each of these three groups has additional fasciculi superadded to it, by which fasciculi it i continued to the head or to near the head, and by which it is increased in bulk & strength Thus to the ILIO-COSTALTS or SACRO-LUMBALIS are superadded the Musciilns accessories ad ilio-costalem (or ad sacro-lumbalem) & the cervicalis ascendens — to th( LONGISSIMUS DORSI are superadded the Transversalis colli <V the tracheio-viastoid; — to the MULTIFIDUS SPIN^ are superadded the Semispiuales dorsi &=■ colli & the rotatores spines. To these groups are also added a few accessory fasciculi, the spinalis dorsi, the spinalis colli Si the biventer cei'vicis SMALL MUSCLES of the SPINOUS & TRANSVERSE PROCESSES - Are the Supraspinales, interspinales, intertransversales, & extensor coccygis. SHORT POSTERIOR CRANIO-VERTEBRAL MUSCLES — Are the Recti capitis postici tnajor minor, & the Obliqui sv.perior dr» inferior. l,eti id ilio-a Jora, tra lU phiis; 1

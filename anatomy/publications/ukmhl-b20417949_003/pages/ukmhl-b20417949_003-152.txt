218 J THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY Arises from tipper & back part of first portion of subclavian. Upwards & backwards to foramen in transverse process of 6th cervical vertebra, passing behini vasculo-nervous bundle of the neck and more particularly behind inferior thyroid artery i internal jugular vein, and then between scalenus anticus & longus coll Upwards through the series of foramina in the transverse processes as far as upper border of axi with the vertebral vein and a plexus of the sympathetic, the artery lying between the vei which is in front, and the cervical nerves which emerge behind from the intervertebrs foramint Upwards & outwards to, and then through, foramen in transverse process of atlas. Backwards & inwards behind lateral mass in groove on posterior arch of atlas, lying in the triai gular space between the recti & obliqui muscles, and being crossed by the posterior branc of the suboccipital nerve and covered by the complexu Pierces posterior occipito-atloid ligament, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Winds round medulla oblongata between hypoglossal nerve and anterior root of suboccipita ascends obliquely between anterior surface of medulla oblongata & basilar process, an joins its fellow opposite lower border of pons Varolii to form basilar trunl BRANCHES â€” Are cervical & cranial. CERVICAL: Muscular - Several, small, to the deep muscles of the neck. ^ Lateral Spinal - Through intervertebral foramina, and divide into t 8 Ant. Branch - To posterior surface of bodies of vertebrae j ^ Post, Branch - To roots of nerves, cord & its membranes. CRANIAL: Posterior Meningeal - Two or three, small, to dura mater of cerebellar fossa. Posterior & Anterior Spinal - Arise respectively behind upper part of coi and in front of meduU The two posterior descend behind the roots of the spinal nerves j The two anterior unite into a single trunk, which descends along midd' line of cor Both join with, and are reinforced by, the numerous spinal branches derive from the vertebral, ascending cervical, inferior thyroid, the intercosta lumbar, ilio-lumbar and lateral sacral; and are thus each of them ooi tinned as small tortuous vessels, or rather as a series of inosculatir vessels, down to the extremity of the cord, where they resolve into twi{ to Cauda equia Posterior Inferior Cerebellar - Backwards round medulla between pneum gastric & spinal accessory nerves, and over restiform body to medif fissure or valley on under surface of cerebellum. Gives off an offset ' "under surface of cerebral hemisphere and twigs to choroid plexus of 41 ventriol,

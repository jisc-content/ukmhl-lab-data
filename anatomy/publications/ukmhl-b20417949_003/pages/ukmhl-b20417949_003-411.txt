VI. 348gg MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND MESENCEPHALON (MESOCEPHALON.) TEANSVEESE SECTIONS. The leading structural features of the Medulla Oblongata, Pons, and Mesencephalon (Mesocephalon) will easily be made out from the following sections. 1. Upper Part of Cord. - The section shows the incipient decussation of the pyramids at the bottom of the antero-median fissure; the anterior cornua of the grey matter are already partly separated from the remainder of the grey matter. Aa Fig. 587.—SRCTioN of upper part of spinal cord. (Quain.) compared with sections lower down, the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando is already some- what enlarged, and nearer to the surface. The central canal is already distinctly posterior to the centre of the cord. 2. Medulla: Lower Part of Pyramid. - The antero-median fissure is shallower, and the anterior commissure is now fully occupied by the pyramidal decussation. Tha Fig. 588.—section of medulla oblongata at lower part of dicussation of pyramids.. (Lockhart Clarke.) /., anterior; f.p., posterior fissure; a.p., pyramid; a., remains of anterior cornu, separated by the decussating- bundles from the rest of the grey matter ; I., continuation of lateral column of cord ; a., continuation of substantia -jelatinosa of Rolando ; p.c, continuation of posterior cornu of grey naatter f.(j., funiculus gracilis.

the arch of the aorta, again, practically, between the same ascending arterial and the descending venous streams. The blood from the left ventricle (the ascending arterial stream) passes up mainly, as above stated, to the head, neck, & upper limbs, because the distal portion of the aorta is largely occupied by the descending venous stream from the right ventricle, which has reached the aorta in advance of the former through the pulmonary artery & the ductus arteriosus.* The venous blood from the head, neck, & upper limbs returns by the large vessels to the Superior Vena Cava, and so to the Right Auricle, - (where it forms the descending venous stream above referred to, - and, slightly mixing with the ascending arterial stream, passes down in front of it to the Right Ventricle, and then to the Pulmonary Artery. Very little of this blood - mainly venous blood - passes to the lungs, which have not yet been inflated; what does, returns by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle. Most of the blood from the pulmonary artery passes through the Ductus Arteriosus to the Aorta, beyond the large vessels to the head, neck, Sf upper limbs. This blood - mainly venous blood - is then carried by the aorta and its branches :â€” [1] to the Viscera; [2] to the Placenta, - whence, after being reoxygeuated, it starts once more uu the course above described; [3] to the Lower Limbs ; - hence the undeveloped condition of these parts in foital life. * The circumstance that nearly the whole of the arterial blood passes up to the head, neck, & upper limbs, accounts the full development of these parts in the foetus.

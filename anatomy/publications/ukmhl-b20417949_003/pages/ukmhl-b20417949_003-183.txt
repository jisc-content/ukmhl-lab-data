228 In Sommering's classification the glosso-pharyngeal nerve becomes the smallest of the three nerves that leave the crnnium through the jugular foramen. In regard to the apparent origins of this nerve and of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory, Fig. 358b will show that it would be structurally more correct to put it simply that the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and accessory portion of the spinal accessory arise from the groove between the olivary and resiiform bodies : from the olive upwards the lateral tract ceases to exist as a distinct element of the medulla. On similar lines one would put it that the facial and auditory nerves arise from the fossa which results from the widening out of the above-mentioned groove at the upper part of the medulla (fossette laterale du bulbe, fossette sus-olivaireâ€”Sappey), the facial nerve being here above and in front of the auditory. At its origin the facial nerve very frequently adheres to the lower border of the pons Avhere the latter is passing into the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. The bulbar or accessory portion of the spinal accessory nerve appears merely to run on the surface of the ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric, and then to be distributed along with the pharyngeal & superior laryngeal branches of the nerve. The motor filaments which do not leave the pneumogastric as above cleave to the trunk for a short distance, but eventually leave it in the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and probably also in the cardiac nerves as well (inhibitory Jibres).

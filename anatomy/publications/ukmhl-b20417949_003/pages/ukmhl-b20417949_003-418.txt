348nTi Fig. 5f)4.—oblique section of pons along the line of exit traversed by the 5th nervr. (SchwaJbe, after Stilling-.) The section passes throuiyh the lower part of the motor nucleus (ny'), from which a bundle of fibre of the motor root is seen passing:, F'; a part of the middle^ sensory nucleus (/iiJ)is also shown in the section in the form of a number of small isolated portions of grey matter. Amongst these are a few bundles of the ascending root cut across, but most of these have already become diverted outwards to join and assist in forming the issuing part of the main or sensory root, V; I, small longitudinal bundle of fibres near the median sulcus (in.s.), passing outwards to join the root of the 5th nerve; f.r., formatio recticularis ; r, raphe ; s.f., substantia ferruginea. In the grey matter of the floor of the narrowing ventricle lies, close to the middle line, the nucleus of the 4th nerve (g c). Externally to this is the descending root of the 5th nerve, with the corresponding nucleus. More deeply may he noticed the section of the substantia ferruginea, and, on the borderland of the formatio reticularis, the section of the posterior longitudinal bundle fp.I.) Outside the eras are seen the oblique fibres of the upper fillet (/'). A. B. Figs. 595 and 596.—sections through the line of exit traversed by the fourth nkrve.

256a DIVISIONS OF THE MEDIASTINUM. The considerable bulging, below, of the middle mediastinum as hitherto described tinbalanced as it is by any corresponding bulk above, has long induced a general and not unnatural desire to add a horizontal division to the previous double vertical division which led to the classical description of three mediastina, - the anterior, the middle, and the posterior. Some want of harmony, however, regarding such horizontal division has long resulted among anatomists from the difficulty of agreeing upon an artificial demarcation where no precise natural demarcation exists. A horizontal division by a plane passing from the junction of the manubrium and gladiolus sterni to the lower part of the fourth dorsal vertebra is proposed, and now somewhat generally accepted ; though it has the evident inconvenience of cutting the arch of the aorta into three portions con- tained in different sections of the mediastinum,* and the superior vena cava and trachea each into two portions also contained in different sections, and, of course, of similarly dividing all the long organs, - as the oesophagus, thoracic duct, pneumogastric & phrenic nerves, - Avhich traverse the thorax throughout.! This division recognises four sections of the mediastinum, or foicr mediastinal which, in so far as they differ from the older sections, - and it will be seen that the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastina, as below described, are considerably curtailed, - may be briefly described as follows :— Superior Mcdiastimun.—Comprised between the manubrium sterni in front, the four upper dorsal vertebras behind, the above-mentioned plane below Cwhich practically corresponds to the upper limit of the pericardium_), and the upper opening of the thorax above. It contains the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, with the innominate artery and the thoracic portions of the left common carotid and left subclavian; the innominate veins and the upper part of the superior vena cava, and the left suijerior intercostal vein ; the trachea down to a little above its bifurcation; the upper part of the several "long organs " above named, including the left recurrent laryngeal nerve; the origins of the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid muscles; the remains of the thymus gland. Middle Mediastinum.—Contains, in addition to the heart and pericardium, the^ ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, the lower fart of the superior vena cava, with the termination of the vena azygos major; the bifurcation of the trachea and the two bronchi; the pulmonary artery with its two branches, and the pulmonary veins ; the lower part of the phrenic nerves. Posterior Mediastinum.—Contains the descending portion of the arch of the aorta, and the thoracic aorta; the venoe azygos major & minor; the splanchnic nerves; and, of course, the lower part of the " long organs," the phrenic nerves excepted. At first sight this would appear not to be so, since, according to still recog-nised descriptions, the level of the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra is that at which the arch of the aorta ends ; but all the levels of the thorax are now lowered by one vertebra (see Bifurcation of trachea, &c., page 256o), so that the termination of the arch of the aorta, not described embryologically, should be placed opposite the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra. The remark in the text does not of course apply to the arch as described embrj'ologically (see page 256j), since this is shortened at both ends. t It must be borne in mind that the segmentation of at least the superior vena cava and the arch of the aorta at the junction of its first and second portions rests to a certain extent on a natural basis, - that of their pericardial investment. It is, roughly speaking, the portion of these vessels invested by the pericardium that is contained in the middle mediastinum, and the portion that is not so invested that is contained in the superior mediastinimi.

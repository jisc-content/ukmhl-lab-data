286 TEMPORAL LOBE-Presents tliree well-marked antero-posterior convolutions, -which are superposed to each other : Sup. Temporal Convolution - Lies between the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius (S^), and the parallel fissure (11). and is continuous behind with the supra-marginal & angular convolutions. MiDDLK Temporal Convolution - Is separated. from the lower one by the inferior temporal fissure (12), and is continuous posteriorly with the angular and post-parietal convolutions, and connected by the third annectent with the middle occipital convolution. Inf. Temporal Convolution - Is partly seen on the under surface of the cerebrum, where it is separated by the occipito-temporal fissure from the external occipito-temporal convolution. It is connected posteriorly to the third occipital by the fourth annectent convolution. OCCIPITAL LOBE - Presents, according to still current descriptions (V. note, page 3481), three rather badly defined convolutions, which are superposed to each other, and are more or less antero-posterior: Sup. Occipital Convolution - Is connected to the superior parietal by the first annectent convolution. Middle Occipital Convolution - Is connected to the angular & middle temporal convolutions by the second and third annectent convolutions. Inf. Occipital Convolution - Is connected to the inferior temporal convolution by the fourth annectent convolution. CENTRAL LOBE, or ISLAND OP REIL-Is deeply situated between the frontal & temporo- sphenoidal lobes at the bottom of the outer part of the fissure of Sylvius. It presents five or six convolutions, the yyri operti, which are nearly straight and mainly â€¢Urected upwards and outwards, and of which the posterior ones are the largest.

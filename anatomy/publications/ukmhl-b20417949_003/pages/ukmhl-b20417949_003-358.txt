is the nucleus of the 7th nerve, but more deeply situated {see p, 152m). Directly- above, and in a line with the nucleus of the 7th nerve, in the upper narrowing part of the floor, is the motor nvclevs of the 5th nerve, also somewhat deeply situated. Higher up still, on the floo'- of the aqueduct of Sylvius, are, anteriorly, the nucleus of the 3rd nerve, and, posteriorly, the nucleus of the, 4:th nerve. Just externally to these nuclei, is the nucleus of the descending root of the 5th nerve (upper sensory nucleus). Besides the above, the 5th nerve has two other nuclei, one (middle sensory nucleus) situated in the formatio reticularis externally to the motor nucleus, and another (corresponding to the ascending root) in the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando as it caps the posterior horn of the grey matter in the lower part of the medulla and upper part of the spinal cord, (See Figs. 358i & j.) The main nucleus of the auditory nerve is in the acustic tubercle above described, from which there mainly arise both the deep root, which passes to the inner side of the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, and the superficial root, which crosses the peduncle externally. Tliere is a small accessory auditory nucleus at the point of junction of the two roots, just in front of the peduncle ; there are also some multipolar cells in the midht of the fibres of the superficial root. At the widest part of the '^4th ventricle there is a small lateral recess extending over the upper part of the restiform body. Fig. 547.â€”nuclei on floor of fourth vkntricle.

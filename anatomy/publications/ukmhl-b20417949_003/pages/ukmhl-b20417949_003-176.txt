228d arising from the under surface of the olfactory bulb. These are about twenty in number, and pass through the foramina of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid to the nose, each being surrounded by a prolongation of the membranes of the brain. They form an inner and an outer group. The former lie at first in shallow grooves on the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and then break up into tufts to the mucous membrane of the upper third of the septum. The latter are similarly distributed to the mucous membrane over the superior turbinated bone, except at its lower edge. The olfactory nerves are composed of non-medullated fibres. Optic Werve. Investigation in the paths of Experimental Physiology and Pathology teaches the following in regard to the fibres of the optic nerve, tract, and commissure:— The optic nerve, as distinguished from the tract and commissure, is der" ,ed from 8 and 9 anterior and posterior quadrigeminal bodies with 10 and 10', their respective brachia; 5 and 6, external and internal geniculate bodies ; 7, optic tract. The other indications are deleted ; the %ure will be found fully explained, page 305. the pulvinar, and from anterior quadrigeminal and external geniculate bodies only, not from the posterior quadrigeminal and internal geniculate bodies. The optic tract and commissure have additional fibres (Gudden's fibres) derived from the internal geniculate bodies, and perhaps from the posterior quadrigeminal bodies (Testut); these fibres are merely commissural, and form but the innermost fibres of 5- Fie. 449c.—ORIGINS of the optic nerve.

(Sappev.) 1, the right auricle ; 2, opening- of the inferior vena cava and the Eustachian valve ; 3, opening of the superior vena cava ; 4, opening of the coronary sinus ; 5, the left auricle ; 6, 6, openings of left, and 7, 7, openings of right pulmonary veins. Fig. 473.—view of a partial dissection of the fibres of the anterior wall of the ventricles in a sheep's heart, DESIGNED TO show the different DEGREES OF OBLIQUITY OF THE SEVEN LAYERS OF FIBRES. (Allen ThomSOn, Quain.) At the base and apex the superficial fibres are displayed ; in the intervening space, more and more of the fibres have been removed from above downwards, the dissection reaching to a somewhat greater depth on the left than on the right, a', a', the superficial fibres of the right ventricle ; b', b', the superficial fibres of the left ventricle ; at 2 these superficial fibres have been removed so as to expose those of the second layer, which are seen to have the same direction as the stiperficial ones over the left ventricle, but a different direction over the right ventricle ; at 3 some of these latter fibres have been removed to expose those of the third layer, which latter are seen to have a airection out slightly' duferent ; 4, fibres of the central or fourth layer^ transverse or annular; 5, 6, 7, fibres of the fifth, sixth, and seventh layers, of opposite obliquity to those of the three outer layei's, passing down to the apex to emerge at the whorl ; between c, c, is the interventricular groove, over which the superficial fibres are seen crossing above and below ; in the central parts of the groove, some of the deeper fibres are seen to turn back- wards into the septum; d, the pulmonary artery ; c, the aorta.

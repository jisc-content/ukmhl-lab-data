Fig. 495.—three laryngoscopic views of the superior aperture of the larynx and surrounding parts in different states op tiir GLOTTIS DURING LIFE. (From Czermak.) A, the glottis during the emission of a high note in singing. B, in easy or quiet inhalation of air. C, in the state of widest possible dilatation, as in inhaling a very deep breath. The diagrams A', B', C, have been added to Czermak's figures to show in horizontal sections of the glottis the position of the vocal ligaments and arytenoid cartilages in the three several states represented in the other figures. In all the figures, so far as marked, the letters indicate the parts as follows, viz. :—the base of the tongue; e, the upper free part of the epiglottis; e', the posterior convex surface, tubercle, or cushion of the epiglottis; ph, part of the anterior wall of the pharynx behind the larynx ; in the margin of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold tv, the swelling of the membrane caused by the cuneiform cartilage; s, that of the corniculum; a, the tip of the arytenoid cartilages ; c v, the true vocal cords or lips of the rima glottidis; c V s, the superior or false vocal cords ; between them the ventricle of the Fig. 496.—sagittal section through larynx and surrounding parts.

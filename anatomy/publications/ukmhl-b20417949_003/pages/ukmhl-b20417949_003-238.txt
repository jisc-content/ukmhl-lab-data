244 THE PLEURA. Surrounds the lung, lines the parietea of the thorax, and forma the lateral boundary of the uedia^'tiua. Tracing it horizontally from the sternum it passes: - Over costal cartilages, ribs, tSr» intercostal spaces / Forwards along side of posterior mediastinum ; Outwards over posterior aspect of root of htnq ; Round posterior part of inner surface, posterior border, outer surface, anterior border, ante- rior part of the inner surface of lung, dipping into the fissures behveen the lobes Inwards over anterior aspect of root of lung ; Fo}-wards along side of pericardium to sternum. Fnferiorlv it covers the diaphragm, from which a thin triangular fold, the ligamentum latum pulmonis, passes up along the side of the pericardium to the inner surface of the lung & to the lower border of its rooc. Superiorly it ascends into the neck an inch or an inch & a half above the first rib, and, under cover of the scaleni, comes in contact with the first & second portions of the subclavian artery. It is thinnest & most adherent over the lung & over the diaphragm. Ft is thickest <& least ad- horent over the thoracic walls. Its inner surface is covered by a layer of navoment epi- thelium, and is moistened by a serou!=! fluid. Its arteries are from the intercostals, internal mammary, phrenic, inferior thyroid, pericardiac, & bronchial. - Its veins correspond to its arteries. - The lymphatics of the visceral layer joiri with those of the lung; the lymphatics of the parietal layer join with those of th© mediastina & the thoro.cic walla. - Its nerves are derived from the pulmonary plexuses (Kolliker), and from the phienic & sympathetic nerves (LushVa), The two pleurag come in contact behind the middle of the sternum.

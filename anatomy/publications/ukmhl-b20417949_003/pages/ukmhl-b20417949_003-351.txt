notch, and forms the anterior half of what was formerly called the anterior or scjuare lobe. Behind the anterior crescentic lobe, is theposterioi- crescentic lobe, forming the back part of Fig. 538.—under surface of ckrehellum, with medulla axd pons varolii. (Hirschfeld, Sappey, Quain.) 1,1, inferior vermiform process ; 2, 2, valley or vallecula ; 3, 3, 3 (from below upwards), posterior inferior lobe, slender lobe, digastric lobe ; 4, amygdala or tonsil ; 5, flocculus ; 6, 7, pons Varolii; 8, middle peduncle of cerebellum ; 9, medulla oblongata; 10, 11, anterior part of great horizontal fissure ; 12, 13, motor and sensory roots of fifth nerve ; 14, sixth nerve; 15, 16, 17, facial nerve, portio intermedia of Wrisberg, and auditory nerve ; 18, 19, 20, glosso-pharyngeal, pneuinogastric, and spinal accessory nerves ; 21, hypoglossal nerve. the former anterior or square lobe; centrally, the posterior crescentic lobe is joined to its fellow by the clivus vionticuli, which forms the descending? part of the monticulus. This clivus and the posterior crescentic lobes constitute tlie Lobus Clivi. Quite at the back part of the upper surface of the cerebellum there comes the Lubus Camminis, Fig. 539.—under surface of the cerebellum, witu iMkdi lla lifted up and the tonsil removed. (Hirschfeld.) 1, uvula, with the furrowed band on either side; 4, nodule, on either side of which is the inferior medullary velum, or commissura ad flocculum, 5 ; 3, inferior vermiform process ; 6, flocculus. forming the upper boundary of the great transverse fissure. The lobus cacuminis consists centrally of the folium, cacuminis^ and laterally of the posterior superior lobes. With

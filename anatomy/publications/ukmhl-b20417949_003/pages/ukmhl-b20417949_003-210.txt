Fig. 497b.—the deeper muscles of the larynx. (Shattock, Quain.) //, body of hyoid bone, cut; e, epiglottis ; th, cut surface of right ala of thyroid cartilage ; cr, front of cricoid cartilage : the articular facet for the inferior cornu of the thyroid is seen posteriorly; tli.ai-, t/i.ar, fibres of the thyro-.arytenoid (outer portion) passing from the thyroid in front to the arytenoid behind ; th.ar', others arising from the crico-tliyroid membrane ; another considerable mass of fibres is seen arising from the same parts, and passing at first obliquely and afterwards nearly vertically upwards as the thyro-epiglottic muscles, th.ep. ; fh.ar.m, small thyro-arytenoid ; th.ar.m', a small slip of the same muscle passing into the false vocal cord ; cr.ar.lat, lateral crico-arytenoid ; cr.ar.p, posterior crico-arytenoid ; r.ar.e-p, right aryteno-epiglottic nmscle near its origin ; l.ar.ep, left aryteno-epiglottic near its insertion; l.ar.ep', portion of the same inserted into the' corniculum ; /, fat; saccule covered by mucous glands. is said to be continued into the anjteno-epiglottidexin,-some of its fibres being prolonged beyond the arytenoid cartilages as follows :— [a] The uppermost into the cartilages of Santorini : these latter fibres form the aryteno- epiglottideus rectus of Luschka. [b] The intermediate ones run on to the inner and outer walls of the sacculus laryngis, (ft) independently, and (6) in conjunction with the oblique fibres of the thyro- arytenoideus below referred to, - the conjoined fibres which reach the epiglottis forming the thyro-arn-epiglottideus. [c] Of the lowest, some blend with the thyro-arytenoidevis, others with the crico-arytenoideus lateralis. approximately, in size, as those of the soft palate. In either apparatus there are four distinct lateral muscles and one median - in all five, different muscles. There are no more-no more that rank aud file, students and teachers, one and all, can dissect and see.

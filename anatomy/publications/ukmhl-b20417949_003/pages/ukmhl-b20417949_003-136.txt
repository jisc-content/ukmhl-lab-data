210 SECOND or OPTIC NEKVE. {Dissectioual description; see new description^ page 2 28d, and note, page 315.) Presents for examination the opUc tract, the optic commissure & the optic nerve proper. OPTIC TRACT Begins in the anterior & posterior qtiadrigeniinal bodies by two distinct bundles of fibres, which pass between the corpora geniculata intei-num et externum^ beoomo respectively connected with and receive fibres from the latter, unite, and receive additional fibres from the optic thalaftms. Winds obliquely forwards across under surface of crus cerebri, being flattened in shape and slightly attached to the crus by its anterior margin. Leaves the crus as a round bundle and becomes connected with the lamina cinerea & the\ tuber cinereum. Joins its fellow to form optic commissure. OPTIC COMMISSURE or CHIASMA Is formed as follows: A few of the outer fibres of each optic tract pass into the optic nerve of the same side. The mass of the fibres decussate, and pass into the optic nerve of the opposite side. A few of the innermost fibres, termed the inter-cerebral fibres, pass back to the cere- brum, forming the posterior fibres of the commissure and the innermost fibres of the optic tract of the opposite side. A few similar fibres, termed the inter-retinal fibres, pass along the anterior border of the commissure from one optic nerve to the other, OPTIC NERVE Through optic foramen, being surrounded by a tubular process of the dura mater, which, as the nerve enters the orbit, subdivides, and both citatiaues the sheath of the optio nerve, and forms the periosteum of the orbit. Pierces sclerotic and choroid about one tenth of an inch to the ianer side of the axis of the eye, and expands into the retina. - The arteria centralis retinse pierces the optio nerve, and runs forwards in its substance to the retina.

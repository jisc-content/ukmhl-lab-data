232 THE PERICARDIUM. Fibro-serous sac containing the heart & the oommenoement of the large vessels.

It is then reflected upon the anterior aspect of the venae cavge pulmonary veins, and upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer. - Marshall's " vestigial fold of the pericardium ** containing the remains of the left sup- erior cardinal vein of the embryo, may be seen in fronc of the root of the le:t lung. The fibrous layer is prolonged upon the great vessels of the root of the neck, and becomes continous superiorly with the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia, that is to say with the layer of fascia which encloses the omo-hyoid muscles, the carotid vessels, & the trachea. The pericardium is conical iu shape, and presents ; - Anterior Aspect - Covered by loose areolar tissue & remains of thymus gland, lungs, pleurae, ij'iddle piece of sternum, and costal cartilages of the left side from the 3rd to the 7th. Posterior Aspect - in contact with roots of the lungs, oesophagus & descending aorta. Lateral Aspects - Covered by pleurae, and crossed by phrenic nerve & superior phrenic vessels. Apez " Directed upwards upon great vessels. fiase - Attached to central or cordiform tendon, & to left anterior costal fibres of diaphragm.

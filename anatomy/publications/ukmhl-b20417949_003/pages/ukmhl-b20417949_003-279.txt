256s omphalo-mesenteric vein iu the substance of the liver,* and takes, as the allautois increases in size while the umbilical vesicle diminishes, a more and more important share in the formation of the portal capillary plexus. - It comes to supply the left lobe entirely, and sends a large coiiitmiiicafiii;/ liranch to the omphalo-viesentn-ic vein, which branch partly supplies the right lobe (Diagrams //and /). There are now two portal veins. Vitelline and Umbilical Veins, and Permanent Portal Circulation. The liver soon receives more blood from the umbilical vein than from the vitelline, and receives more blood than it requires. Its vessels are then relieved as follows (Diagrams / and ./) : - A second communicating branch, the dacias venosus (Diagram /), formed by the dilatation of one of the hepatic capillaries, joins the umbilical A-ein to the "common inferior caval trunk," and conveys part of the blood from the former directly to the inferior vena cava, and to the heart. J Fig. 31.—diagram of the permanent portal circulation. rh., l.h., right and left branches of the portal vein. At birth, both the trunk of the unibiliml vein and the ductus venosus become obliterated, but the branches of distribution of the umbilical vein, and its communicating brunch to the omphalo-mesenteric vein persist (Diagram J), - the circulation in the latter branch being, however, reversed. ■ The umbilical vein first opens into the vitelline vein above the liver. But through the development of a collateral branch below the liver, and the atrophy of the upper part of the ori^nnal trunk, ihe umbilical vein subsequently comes to open into the vitelline vein below the liver.

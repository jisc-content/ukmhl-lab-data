348rr flexure. There appears the sharp backward pontal flexure in the middle of the hind-brain, - that is, between the epencephalon and the metencephalon, or in the situation of the future pons varolii. Finally, there is a gradual bending forwards of the hind-brain as a whole on the future spinal cord : this is the cervical or nuchal flexure. From the cerebral vesicles above named there are developed respectively : - PROSEWG.EPH. THALAWIENCEPH.NIESENCEPH EPENCEPH. METENCEPH.

Epencephalon - Cerebellum, pons varolii, crura cerebelli, valve of Vieussens. Mid-Brain. - Mesencephalon - Tubercula quadrigemina, crura cerebri, aqueduct of Sylvius. Fore-Brain. - Thalamencephalon - Optic thalami; third ventricle; pineal gland, infundibulum & pituitary body ; optic tracts, chiasma, optic nerves & retina. Prosencephalon - Cerebral hemispheres; corpora striata; lateral ventricles; olfactory bulbs; corpus callosum, fornix. Details may now be added: - Metencephalon, - Its floor and sides thicken considerably, and become divided into the well-known columns of the medulla. Its roof produces no nerve-substance, and mtsrely foyms m epithelial investinent to the plicatlotis of the thickened pia mater, or

THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. NoTK. - Few anatoniisis know much now-a-days of the deep muscles of the back,-the last to study them with any special care being the French anatomist, Cruveilhier. They are not difficult to dissect, however ; and, for those who care for Anatomj', except for mere examinational purposes, they supply a most interesting study of serial homology. The figures, which, carefully examined in the light of the explanations given, will be found to lend the greatest aid to the dissection, are Figures 483, 484, 485, and 491. These, and several others, are taken (some with slight alterations) from the moimmental work of Bourgery and Jacob, the distinguished forerunners of Hirschfeld and Leveille in anatomical illustration.

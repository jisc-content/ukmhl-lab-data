228b the hypoglossal nerve now appears to be limited to the muscles of the tongue, - the branches which this nerve seems to give off to the infra-hyoid muscles, and to the thyro- hyoid and genio-hyoid, being really derived from the loops between the first & second and second & third cervical nerves Fig. 449a.â€”plan of THK branches ArPARBNTLV GIVEN OFF BY THE lIYPOGLOSSAli NERVE, BUT REALLY DERIVED FROM THE CERVICAL PLEXUS. (Quttin, after Holl.) Filaments from the loop between the^first and second cervical nerves (ansa atlantis) join the outer aspect of the hypoglossal nerve, and appear to become incorporated with it. A portion of these pass up in the trunk of the nerve to supply the recti capitis antici major and minor, and to run, perhaps, in the recurrent branch to the dura mater. Other filaments descend till, having reached the level where the hypoglossal nerve loops round the occipital artery, some of them leave the trunk to form part of the descendens and ansa hypoglossi, while others pass on a little further, as further explained, to the thyro-hyoid and genio-hyoid. From the loop between the second and third cervical nerves there descends, either the communicans cervicis, or two smaller branches, more or less conjoined, the conununicans

152q The middle sensory nucleus (Y.S. in Fig. 358a, N.V.S. in Fig. 358i)* is a small one situated externally to, a little below, and somewhat deeper than, the motor Fig. 358i.—sagittal section through medulla, PONS, tubercula, and crura, showing the NUCLEI AND ROOT-FIBRES OF THE FIFTH NERVE. (Quain.) V.M., V.S., motor and sensory portions of the nerve; V.D., descending sensory root (the accompanying- dots represent the corresijonding- nucleus); N.V.M., motor nucleus, with N.V.S., upper sensory nucleus, just below it; S.G.R., sub- stantia geiatinosa of Rolando, forming the lower sensory nucleus; V.A., corresponding ascending sensory root. Fig. 358j.—transverse section through upper part of pons. showing descending root of fifth NERVE, v.d. (Quain, after Stilling & Schwalbe.) nucleus ; it gives off but a small number of the fibres ; these are joined inferiorly by the main bundle of sensory fibres derived from the lower sensory nucleus. The lower sensory nucleus lies in the cells of the substantia gelatinosaof Rolando, a long way down the medulla (S.G.R., Fig. 358i). From it there ascends the large ascending sensory root, which is such a prominent feature in the transverse sections of the medulla (See a. V., Figs. 358k, l, n, & F.a., Fig. 358m). This ascending root passes up, capping in section the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando, and joins inferiorly the fibres from the middle sensory root. * This nucleus is termed the M^^jser sensory nucleus in Quain's Anatomy (Tenth Ed.), in which work the character of the descending root and corresponding nucleus on the floor of the Sylvian aqueduct is not defined. That these parts are sensory would appear to be certain from the investigations of Duval. Hence the slightly altered designation (see Note, p. 152o).

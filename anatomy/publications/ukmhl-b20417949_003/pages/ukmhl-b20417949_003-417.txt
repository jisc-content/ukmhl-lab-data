348ram is no longer visible, but in the antero-la1;eral part of the reticnluar formation there are one or two small collections of grey matter known as the superior olive. A special set of transverse fibres is here visible, the trapezium, probably connected with the cells of the superior auditory nucleus. Crossing the root fibres of the sixth and facial nerves, they run ventrally to the ascending root of the fifth nerve, and apparently join the accessory auditory nucleus and the ventral root of the auditory nerve. A section a little higher up shows the motor nucleus of the 5th nerve, and part of its middle sensory nucleus,* with, in its midst, a few transversely cut fibres of the ascending root. 7.

Dorsal to the pons, and separated from it by the still wide and undivided plane of the fillet (I, l^), is the continuation of the formatio reticularis surmounted by the grey Fig. 593.â€”section through upper part of pons.

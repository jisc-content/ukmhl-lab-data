292 INTERNAL STRUCTURE of the HEMISPHERES. PARTS SEEN BEFORE OPENING THE VENTRICLES : Centrum Ovale Minus- With the puncta vasculosa & the convoluted margin of the divided grey matter. Callosal Fissure, or Ventricle of the Corpus Callosum - Comprised between the corpus callosum & the callosal gyrus. This fissure surrounds the corpus callosum, and becomes continuous at the splenium w^ith the dentate fissure. Centrum Ovale Majus-Into which the main body of the fibres of the corpus callosum are continued on either side. Corpus Callosum - Thick stratum of transverse & radiating white fibres which connect the two hemispheres; situated above the fornix, to which it is joined behind, and to which it is connected in front by the septum lucidum ; forms the roof of both lateral ventricles; arched from before backwards, thickest & broadest behind, thinnest towards centre. It presents: Upper Surface - Convex from before backwards, striated transversely, marked by a m.edian depressed raph^ wh'ch is bounded by two slightly elevated bands termed the strice longitudinales, or nerves of Lancisi. More externally, beneath the callosal gyrus, are other similar bands, the stricB longitudinales laterales or stricB tecfxe. Under Surface - Blended behind with the fornix. In front, where it forms the roof of the lateral ventricles, it is connected with the fornix by the septum lucidum. Anterior Extremity or Genu - Curves downwards & backwards, presenting a narrowing reflected portion, the beak or rostrum. This latter is connected with the lamina cinerea, and gives off two small white bands or peduncles (Fig. 505), which cross the anterior perforated space to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius. Posterior Extremity or Splenium - Thick & rounded. Forms upper boundary of middle portion of transverse fissure ; is joined in front with the fornix.

305 INTERNAL CAPSULE. The infernal cap-mJe is a similar but much wider plane separating the lenticular nucleus from the caudate nucleus in front, and the optic thalamus behind. In coronal section it shows the arched arrangement of the white radiating bimdles. In horizontal section, which shows best the main anatomical features, it presents a shorter anterior limb separating the lenticular and caudate nuclei, and a longer posterior limb separating the lenticular nucleus from the optic thalamus. The two limbs meet at angle open externally, the genu. The anterior limb contains the fibres passing from the frontal lobe to the inner part of the crus cerebri; the front part of the posterior limb, the part just behind the genu, contains the fibres passing from the motor area to the middle part of the crus ; the back part of the posterior limb contains the fibres passing from the occipital and temporal lobes to the outer part of the crus.

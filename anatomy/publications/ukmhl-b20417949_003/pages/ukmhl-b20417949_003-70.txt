170 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. Arises by ten or twelve filaments from groove between anterior pyramid iSr' olivary body in a lien continuous with that of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. These filamentai form two bundles which perforate dura mater separately, and pass together through anterior condyloid foramen Passes downwards and forwards between pneumogastrio & spinal accessory ns., with former of which it is intimately connected, and between int. jugular vein & int. carotid Loops round occipital artery and passes forwards across external carotid below post, belly of digastric, Passes beneath posterior belly of digastric & stylo-hyoid and crosses hyo-glossus, near ant. border of which it anastomoses with gustatory. Passes beneath mylo-hyoid to muscles & suljstance of the tongue, BRS. OF COMMUNICATION - Join with. G. of the trunk of the pneumogastric; I Gustatory n. — Arises near ant. border of hyo-glossus Sup. cervical g. of the sympathetic; ^ Arise near base of skull. Loop between the two first cervical ns. BRS. OF DISTRIBUTION - Aretha: Descendens Noni — Long & slender. Arises just beneath occipital artery. Passes downwards & forwards across sheath of carotid vessels. (Sometimes within the sheath, either over or beneath int. jugular vein). Near middle of neck forms a loop with Communicans Noni, from convexity of which loop, brs. are given off to sterno-hyoid & -thyroid and omo-hyoid,ii This br. is believed to derive its real origin principally from the Ist & 3rd cervical ns., and to have little more than an apparent origin from the hypoglossal, due to a temporary adhesion of its fibres to those of that nerve. Sometimes, owing to similar adhesions, it appears to arise from the pneumogastric either wholly or in part. Brs. to Thyro-hyoid & Genio-hyoid — Arise on surface of hyo-glossus. Brs. to Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio-hyo-glossus & subs- tance of the tongue, ■— Arise benpath milo-hynid. i

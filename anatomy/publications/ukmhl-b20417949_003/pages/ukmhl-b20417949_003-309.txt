But, necessary repetitions set aside, the general diiference in importance will be borne in mind between the subjects treated of in the Notes, an I those treated of in the Tablets. Looking at the Notes, the most weighty matter presented is certainly that referring to the descriptions of the Cerebral Surface as given of late by Professors Cunningham and Turner, S33 pp. 348i to 348p, Careful attention should also be paid to the transversa section of the medulla througb the middle of the olivary body, see page 34"^ii. It has been somewhat of a sacritice to place these interesting topics among the Notes, but this seemed unavoidable. In regard to the cerebral surface, two, one might say three, different lines of description have been followed. In the Tablets proper the subject is dealt with from tbe applied or utilitarian standpoint of the descriptions given in Gray's Anatomy, (Here it is the interlobar Jissures and the priticipal convolution that have been described.) Such descriptions ought, the Author thinks, to meet the wants of most men. The Notes on the Newer Matter deal with the subject with additional detail, and summarise the very interesting views above referred to of Professors Cunningham and Turner. (The someivliat leh's important fissures and convoluiious liave here been described.) Wider genei-alisations - somewhat wild imaginings, it is submitted - have been allowed scope in the description of the Limbic lobe. What has become of Broca's r^^ally useful anthropolofjical work I

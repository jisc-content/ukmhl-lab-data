Fig. 483.—profile vikvv of the skparated fasciclli of the ilio-costalis, AND OF ITS ACCESSORY MUSCLES. (Bourgery.) The fig-ure shows :— (A), the insertions of the ilio-costalis into the ano-les of the six lower ribs, 1 to 1. (P) che origins of the muscuhis accessorius ad ilio-costalein from the anfjles of the six lower ribs internally to (in the fij^ure deeper than) the insertions of the princijjal muscle, 2 to 2. These origins are necessarily somewhat concealed by the insertions of the principal nmscle, which are superficial to them, (C) , the insertions of the musculus accessorius into the angles of the six upper ribs, 3 to 8. These are superficial, like the insertions of the principal muscle ; they, in fact, continue the insertions of the principal muscle without any apparent interruption, and somewhat conceal the following. (D) (quite deeply, at the upper part), three of the relatively slender tendons of origin ol the cervicalis ascendens, 4 to 4. These are related to the insertions of the musculus accessorius, just as are the origins of this latter muscle to the insertions of the ilio-costalis. (E) , the insertions of the cervicaiis ascendens are shown a little higher up into the posterior tubercles of the three lower transverse processes.

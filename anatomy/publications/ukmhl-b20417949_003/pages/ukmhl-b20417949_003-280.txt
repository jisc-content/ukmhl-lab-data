The portal system is then definitely constituted by: - 1, The mesenteric branches and irunJc of the left or persistent vitelline or omphalo- mesenteric vein, - the small portion of the trunk contained in the liver becoming the right branch of bifurcation, or the branch to the right lobe. 2. The branches of distribution of the umbilical vein, and the communicating branch between this vein and the o?»;9AaZo-?He5V?i^er?c, which communicating branch becomes the left branch of bifurcation of the portal trunk, or the branch to the left lobe. It is believed that the separate description of the three stages of the portal circulation will facilitate the study of this difncult subject. The large veins that reach the foetal auricle are first the left vitelline or omphalo-mesenteric vein, and the t«o ducts of Cu\-ier, and, later on, and indirectly, the umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava, both of -which latter open into the left vitelline A-ein. AH the above vessels open into what becomes the rig-ht auricle. After the differentiation of the common auricle, or atrium, into right and left auricles, the latter auricle receives the pulmonary vein.s. In the early stages of cardiac evolution the above vessels open in groups, and not singly, into the corresponding auricle. The ducts of Cuvier and the vitelline vein open into the right auricle by means of a common stem, the bulbus venosus. It is by the expansion, later on, of the bulbus venosus, and by the consequent absorption of its walls into the auricular boundary, that the three openings (now the coronarj" sinus and the superior and inferior venae cavae) become separate and distinct. The same thing happens in connection with the four pulmonary veins, of which, even in the adult, the two left ones often terminate conjointly.

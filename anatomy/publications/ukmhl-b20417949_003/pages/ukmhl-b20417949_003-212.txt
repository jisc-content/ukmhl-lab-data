The superior aijerture of the larynx is supposed to be closed during deglutition by the larynx being drawn up against the base of the tongue, the epiglottis being thereby - relatively to the larynx - pressed down as a lid upon the aperture. It has recently been concluded that this is really not the case : in some of the lower animals, the arytenoid cartilages appear to be drawn together and pressed against the epiglottis by the action of the arytenoid and thyro-arytenoid nniscles. not many of us now-a-days, who know practically nothing, in the sense of having personally looked into the matter,* of what lies beneath the fur on the surface?

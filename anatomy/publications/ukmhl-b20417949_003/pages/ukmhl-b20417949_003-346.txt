Fig. 531.â€”mesial section through cerebrum, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. (Hirschfeld.) 1, medulla oblongata ; 2, pons varolii; 3, cms cerebri divided sagittally ; 4, arbor vitse ; 6, valve of Vieussens, forming mesially the upper part of the posterior boundary of the fourth ventricle, which is seen to be bounded below by the inferior medullary velum ; 5, aqueduct of Sylvius; 7, tubercula quadrigemina; 8, 9, pineal gland ; 10, its superior peduncle, or stria pinealis ; 11, central portion of great transverse fissure, or transverse fissure of Bichat; 12, upper surface of optic thalamus partly covered by the ragged and torn edge of the velum interpositum ; 24, fornix : its anterior crus is divided before it reaches corpus albicans, 18 ; 13, inner surface of optic thalamus, forming lateral boundary of third ventricle ; 14, middle, soft, or grey commissure ; 23, foramen of Monro ; 22, anterior commissure ; 15, 16, 17, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and pituitary ho iy ; 19, posterior perforated space; 20, third nerve; 21, optic nerve ; 25, septum lucidum ; 26, corpus callosum ; 27, its posterior extremity, or splenium; 28, its genu, ending in its beak or rostrum ; 29, ventricle of the corpus callosum or callosal fissure ; 30, convolution of the corpus callosum, or callosal gyrus ; 31, marginal convolution ; 32, calloso-marginal fissure. The internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures are well marked, the former separating the cuneate & precuniate lobules ; so is also the paracentral fissure, forming the anterior boundary of the paracentral lobule. These latter indications are the more valuable in that the figure was drawn from nature before the fissures & convolutions of the inner surface of the hemisphere had been at all fully described.

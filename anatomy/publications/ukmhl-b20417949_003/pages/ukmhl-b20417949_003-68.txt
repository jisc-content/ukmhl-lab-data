168 CERVICAL PLEXUS. DEEP BRANCHES — Divided into internal & external. INTERNAL -Are: Communicating - From loop betwp-en 1st & 2nd cervical to pnenmogastric, hypoglossal < superior cervical ganglion of sympathetic; and also from 3rd & 4th to cord t sympathetic below the ganglioi Muscular - From 1st & 2nd, to recti capitis antici major & minor, and rectus lateralis Commnnicans Noni - From 2nd & 3rd. Downwards & forwards across sheath of carotid vessels (sometimes within the sheafcl and then either in front of or behind internal jugular vein), and, near middl of neck, forms a loop with descendens noni; from convexity of which loo' branches are given off to the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid and omo-hyoid Phrenic or Int. Respiratory of Sir C. Bell - From Srd, 4th, and usually also from 5tl Downwards & inwards in front of scalenus anticus. Between subclavian vein & 1st part of subclavian artery crossing internal mammary and receiving a filament from sympathetic, sometimes another from 5th & 6t' cervical nerves, and occasionally on the left side, one from the ansa hypoglossi Crosses arch of Aorta & pulmonary artery, on the left side. Descends, on the right side, on outer side of right innominate vein & sup. vena cavj In front of root of lung & along side of pericardium to diaphragm, and divides i: • . . to branches which perforate the diaphragm and supply it by its under surfac( Both nerves give off twigs to the pericardium & pleura, and join with the phreni plexus of the sympathetic, the right nerve sending also a few filaments to thl diaphragmatic ganglioi^ EXTERNAL —Are: Comnmnicating - Join spinal accessory in substance of sterno-mastoid, in occipits triangle, & beneath trapeziiu Muscular - To sterno-mastoid (from 2nd nerve), levator anguli scapulas (from Srd), scal« nus medius & trapezius (from 3rd & 4thj

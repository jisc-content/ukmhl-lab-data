THE SPINAL CORD. The spinal cord is about IS inches long, and extends from the foramen magnum to tlie lower part of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, or upper part of the second. Above, it is continued into the medulla oblongata: below, it tapers to a point (conus Tuedullaris), and ends in a slender filament, \\\^,fhim tenmnak, or hgamentii/n centralc. The exact position of the lower end of the cord varies somewhat according to the curvature of the vertebral column ; in marked flexion the end of theconl is slightlv raised, In the fu;tus, at an early period, the cord occupies the whole length of the vertebral

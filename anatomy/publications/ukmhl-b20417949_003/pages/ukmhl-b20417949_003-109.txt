195 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE Arisob by ten or twelve filaments from groove oeUveen anterior pyrnviid dr" olivary body in a linv continuous with that of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. These filamenta form two bundles which perforate dura mater separately, and pass together through anterior condyloid foramen. Passes downwards and forwards between pneumogastric & spinal accessory ns., with former of wiiich it is intimately connected, and between int. jugular vein & int. carotid. Loops round occipital artery and passes forwards across external carotid below post, belly of digastric. Passes beneath posterior belly of digastric & stylo-hyoid and crosses hyo-glossus, near ant. border of which it auasLutuoses with gusluLory Passes beneath mylo-hyoid to muscles & substance of the tongue. BRS. OF COMMUNICATION — Join with. G. of the trunk of the pneumogastric 5 ^ Sup. cervical g. of the sympathetic; \ Arise near base of sknlL Loop between the two first cervical ns. J Gustatory u. — Arises near ant. border of hyo-glossua. BRS. OF DISTRIBUTION - Are the: Descendens Noni — Long & slender. Arises just beneath occipital artery. Passes downwards & forwards across sheath of carotid vessels. (Somoiimet within the sheath, either over or beneath int. jugular vein). Near mil; J'.e of neck forms a loop with Communicans Noni, from convexity of which loop, brs. are given otf to sierno-hyoid & -thyroid and omo-hyoid This br. is believed to derive its real origin principally from the 1st & 2ud cervical ns., and to have little more than an apparent origin from the hypoglossal, due to a temporary aunesion ol its fibres to those of that nerve. Sometimes, owing to similar adhesions, it appears to arise from the pneumogastric either wholly or in part Brs. to Thyro-hyoid & Genio-hyoid — A.rise on surface of hyo-glosbus. Brs. to Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio-hyo-glossus & subs- tance of the tongue. — AHsb beneath mylo-liyoid.

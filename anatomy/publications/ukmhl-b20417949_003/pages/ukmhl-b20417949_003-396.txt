34^r It may be added that in man the limbic lobe is but partly circumscribed, its only distinct boundaries being the calloso-marginal fissure and the front part of the collateral fissure, - though posteriorly it is partly separated from the quadrate lobule by the less constant sub-parietal, or, in morphological language, post-limbic, sulcus. In many of the lower animals it is distinctly circumscribed by one continuous fissure, the limbic fissure of Broca, - which fissure is now termed, however, the outer limbic fissure, since there is now recognised an inner limbic fissure (continuous callosal, and choroid, or hippocampal fissures), separating the outer and inner limbic circles. In all probability this " inner limbic fissure " will soon have to be called the "middle limbic fissure," and a further inner limbic fissure will have to be recognised, separating the fornix from the optic thalamus and brain-stem. If the fornix is to be a part of the limbic system, there are three limbic circles, and, therefore, there must be three limbic fissures. * The limbic lobe is connected by more or less distinct annectent gyri with the lingual gyrus of the temporal lobe, the orbital gyri of the frontal lobe, the post-central lobule of the insula, and with the cuneate and quadrate lobules. * Speaking seriously, and as men with a responsibility on our shoulders, is it not evident that to take in the bearing- of the generalisations upon which rests the recognition of the limbic system is beyond the scope of the practical work of any medical man, - one would almost say bej^ond the powers of a medical man, as such 1 If this kind of Anatomy is to be insisted upon, we are surely not far from the deadlock foreseen, evidently with deep anxiety, by Professor Macalister.

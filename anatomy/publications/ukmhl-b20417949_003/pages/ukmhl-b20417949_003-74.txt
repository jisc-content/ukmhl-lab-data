172 BUS. of DISTRIB. of the CERV. G. of the SYMPATHETK These ganglia give off branches to the neighbouring arteries and to the viscera as follows: BRS. to the NEIGHBOURING ARTERIES: SUP. CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: ASCENDING BRANCH to INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY & its BRANCHES Large, soft, of a reddish grey colour, and appears to be the direct coutinu tion of the ganglion. It passes along the posterior aspect of internal caro artery and divides on reaching the carotid canal into internal & exteri branches. iMEiNAL Bkanch - The smaller; ascends on inner side of internal caro artery, communicating -with the outer branch, and goes to form i greater part of the cavernous plexus. External Branch - The larger; ascends on outer side of internal caro artery, communicating with the inner branch, and goes to form t greater part of the carotid plexus. ANTERIOR BRANCHES to EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY & its BRANCH — Form delicate plexuses which accompany the external carotid artery dr" branchesy and on the filaments of which small ganglia are sometimes found From the plexus on the trunk of the external carotid artery a communi( ting branch is given off to the digastric branch of the facial nerve* fn the plexus on the facial artery is derived the sympathetic root of the b; maxillary ganglion; from the plexus on the internal maxillary artery derived the sympathetic root of the otic ganglion and also a twig to t iutumescentia gangliformis of the facial. MIDDLE CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: THYROID BRANCHES — Accompany the inferior thyroid artery, commnnicati with superior cardiac nerve, and reach the thyroid body, in which tb communicate with the recurrent & external laryngeal nerves. INF. CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: BRANCHES to VERTEBRAL ARTERY — Form a plexus round that vessel, a communicate with the cervical nerves as high as the 4th. BRS. to the VISCERA — Are the: Cardiac Nerves - Vide Next Tablet. Pharyngeal Branches of the Superior Cervical Ganglion - Join with i pharyngeal branche^j the ^losso-pharyngeal,pneumogasiricy external laryngeal form the pharyngeal plexus, which plexus supplies the muscles & the mucc membrane of the phaiyux. Thyroid Branches of the Middle Cervical Ganglion - Vide above.

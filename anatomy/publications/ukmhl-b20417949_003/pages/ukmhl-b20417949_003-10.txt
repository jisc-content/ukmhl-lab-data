" Practical anatomy 2va.^ a discipline oÂ£ incalculable value, for not only was the knowledge acquired an end in itself, but tke method whereby it was gained was the most valuable part of the entire medical training. Anatomy occupied a nnir/ue position in the curriculum. In all other departments the student had no alternative but to blindly accept the dictum of teacher or text-book. Here he was trained to use his eyes and his hands; here he was educated to translate the impressions made by the objects of his study on his senses into words, this enabling him to check the descriptions in his books, or those taught in the lecture room, by comparing the realities under his hands with the verbal accounts of them given by his teachers : In the dissecting room every student was an investigator!'

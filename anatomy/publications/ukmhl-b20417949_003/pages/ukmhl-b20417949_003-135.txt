209 OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. Arises from iuternal carotid as that vessel emerpres from caTe/taiis vsinns between optio nerve i anterior clinoid prncesÂ«. Through optio foramen below & on outer side of optic nerve. Over optio nerve, and forwards beneath superior oblique to snperior internal angle of or^ it, where divides into frontal & nasal. BRANCHES May be divided into t ORBITAL GROUP: Lachrymal - With lachrymal nerve & above external rectus to lachrymal glanfi & upper eyelid. Gives off small malar & temporal branches, which per- forate malar bone to temporal fossa & cheek. Supraorbital - With frontal nerve & above the muscles to supraorbital foraineu, where divides into superficial & deep branches to integument & musplea of forehead & pericrani'tai. Ethmoidal --^iiterior & posterior. Through anterior & posterior ethraoijal foramina (former with nasal nerve), giving branches to ethmoidal cells ?i dura mater, and then through foramina in cribriform plate of ethmoid to septum & outer wall of nose Palpebral - Superior & inferior. Encircle eyelids near free margin & beneath orbicularis, and anastomose with infraorbital & with orbital branch o:' temporal. Frontal - From orbit at its superior internal angle to skin & muscles of forehead & pericranium, joining with supraorbital. ITasal - Above tendo oculi, and divides into dorsalis nasi to dorsum of nose and anastomotic branch to angular branch of facia. OCULAR group: Muscular - Very variable, usually divided into: Superior - Smaller, to levator palpebrse superioris, superior rectus & aupe. rior oblique; Inferior - Larger, to inferior oblique & the other recti, and gives off most of the anterior ciliary arteries. Ciliary - May be divided into: SHORT POSTEEIOU - Surround optic nerve, and through sclerotic a lino or two from the nerve to ciliary processes & choroijl LONG - Two. Through back part of sclerotic, and between sclerotic & choroiu on either side of eyeball to ciliary body, where bifurcate and t\,rin great arterial circle of iris, from which small twigs converge to frse margin of iris forming lesser arterial circln ANTERIOR - Chiefly from muscular. Through sclerotic a line or two from margin of cornea to great arterial circle of iris Centralis Retinse - Pierces optic nerve, and forwards in its substance tc retina. In foetus a small branch passes forwards through vitreous body to posterior part of capsule of lens.

280 THE SURFACE of the CEREBRUM. The cerebral hemispheres j^rcsent five lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital & temporal, and the central lub^j or Island of Keil, to which may be added, in "advauced" ariatomy, the opercular lobe (Macalister), and the limbic or falciform lobe (Broca, Schwalbe) demarcated on physiological or morphological grounds. These lobes, the latter excepted, are seen most extensively on the upper or convex surface of the hemispheres. UPPER OR CONVEX SURFACE OP THE HEMISPHERES : - Presents: THREE INTERLOBAR FISSURES: FISSURE OF KOLANDO - (li) â€” Begins a little behind the middle of the longi- tudinal fissure and passes downwards & forwards to near the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius, separating the frontal & parietal lobes. EXTERNAL PARIETO - OCCIPITAL FISSUEE - (P.O.) - Separates the parietal and occipital lobes above. - Is usually not more than half an inch in length, and is sometimes scarcely recognisable except by its being continuous with the internal parieto-occipital fissure on the inner surface of the hemisphere (P.O., Fig. 500). POSTERIOR LIMB OF THE FISSURE OF SYLVIUS - (S^) - Passes backwards behind the central lobe, separting the temporal lobe from the frontal & parietal lobes. It ends by turning up into the parietal lobe, where it is arched over by the supra-marginal convolution.

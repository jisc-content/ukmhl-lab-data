The fibres of the corpus callosuin spread out into every part of the hemisi)hero. The anterior fibres, those from the geim, first pass forwards into the frontal lobe, and then cur\ c inwards, formin{? the forceps minor. The posterior fibres, those from the splenium, pass backwards into the occipital lobe, and then turn inwards, forming- the forceps major. Of the central fibres, [1] The uppermost curve upwards and then inwards to the upper and mesial parts of the frontal & parietal lobes. [2] The intermediate pass outwards to the outer parts of the same lobes. [3] The lowest are divided into an anterior set, which yo to the opercular convolutions, and a posterior set, which, forming- the tapeturn, spread out over the posterior & descending cormia of the lateral ventricle into the occipital and temporal lobes respectively. The rotundity of the splenium results from the posterior part of the corpus callosum doubling up upon itself, so that a small portion is folded forwards under the larger part {See Fig. .o45). On leavinig the splenium posteriorly, tlie sirice longitudinales spread out on the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus and on the gyrus uncinatus to form the mbstaniia reticularix alba or alveiis. The strio', longitudinales are continuous anteriorly with the peduncles. (See Limbic Lolie, p. 348p.) Fl«. 507. —KlIiHKS OK TIIK ( OlMTS c'ALI,0S1'M AS SKKX FROM rXDHRN-RATII.

There is shown in 6 & 7 the decussation of the fibres of the corpus callosum with those of the internal capsule, the latter being exposed in 6 through the removal of the caudate nucleus, and in 8 through the removal of the lenticular nucleus. 9, section of the claustrum ; 10, splenium of corpus callosum; 11, section of genu with, behind it, the section of the fifth ventricle.

256v remains a separate ossificatiou in cheloniaus, lizards, and crocodiles. Another point may be added: The neck of the odontoid process is embraced behind by the transverse ligament, the representative in the neck of the posterior conjugal ligament, and in front by the anterior arch of the atlas, which rejDresents two rudimentary ribs joined by an ossified anterior transverse ligament. (See below.) Sutton's Anterior and Posterior Conjugal Ligaments of the Ribs. Are Avell marked in the human foetus, and are permanent in many mammals, including the seal, the horse, lion, dog, rabbit, &c. They are strong rounded bands connecting the corresponding ribs of each side, and encircling the intervertebral discs in front and behind. In the human adult, the anterior conjugal ligament becomes the middle fasciculus of the stellate or anterior costo-vertebral ligament; while the posterior one becomes the interosseous costo-vertebral ligament. The sub-vertebral wedge-bones, hyjjapophyses, or intercentra, found between the bodies of the lumbar vertebriB in the mole, and which form a continuous series between the vertebral centra in the sphenodon, are ossifications of these anterior conjugal ligaments of the ribs. Transverse and Check Ligaments of the Atlo-Axoid and Occipito- Odontoid Articulations, Both these are repetitions of the posterior conjugal ligaments above referred to. Anterior Arch of the Atlas. This consists of two rudimentary ribs joined together by an ossified anterior conjugal ligament: - That the front part of the lateral masses of the atlas consists of two rudimentary ribs cannot be doubted : it corresponds to the anterior part of the other cervical transverse processes. The conclusion that these ribs are joined as above stated results froiu a consideration of the sub-vertebral wedge-bones or hypapophyses of the mole and sphenodon above alluded to.
